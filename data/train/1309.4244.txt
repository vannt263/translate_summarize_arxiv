    "the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions is now a well - known theoretical assumption where our four dimensional world is considered to be a @xmath0-brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "such a description emerges naturally in the backdrop of various string - inspired models @xcite .",
    "moreover , extra dimensional models were developed as a non - supersymmetric , alternative approach in tackling the well - known fine tuning / gauge hierarchy problem in the regime of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it became more and more evident that gravity may become an integral part to address issues on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "+ the extra dimensional models can broadly be classified into those having large compact radii @xcite or having small compact radii @xcite . regarding their geometry ,",
    "these models are generally compactified under various topological setups .",
    "the uncompactified , four dimensional spacetime then emerges as a low energy effective theory which contains signatures of the higher dimensional theory .",
    "+ however , among all models proposed so far , we will confine ourselves to the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite which has two @xmath0-branes , with equal and opposite brane tensions , embedded in a five dimensional spacetime .",
    "this model was initially developed to combat the unnatural fine tuning involved in determining the mass of the higgs boson . while determining the theoretically predicted mass of the higgs boson ( @xmath1 gev ) from higher order self energy calculations , this boson gets quantum corrections typically of the order of the planck energy scale . as a result ,",
    "an extreme fine tuning needs to be carried out at every order of perturbation theory to obtain the theoretically predicted value .",
    "this fine tuning is often known as the higgs mass hierarchy problem or naturalness problem in particle physics . without introducing any intermediate scale in the theory ,",
    "the rs model successfully resolved the fine tuning problem by exponentially suppressing all mass scales on one of the @xmath0-branes , known as the visible brane .",
    "thus the entire low energy theory is reproduced on the negative tension visible brane at tev scale . by far , this is one of the most successful approach for addressing the naturalness problem for a constant inter - brane separation .",
    "+ however the rs model suffered from the stabilization problem . in the absence of any stabilization scheme ,",
    "the two brane system can collapse under the influence of equal and opposite brane tensions .",
    "therefore , a reasonably generic method for stabilising the brane separation distance @xmath2 or the modulus field , was proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite in which a stabilizing potential for the modulus field is generated by a @xmath3 bulk scalar field with appropriate value at the boundary .",
    "the minimum of the modulus potential corresponds to the vev of the modulus field ( @xmath4 ) . from this condition",
    "the vev of the modulus field can be set as @xmath5 ( to resolve the naturalness problem ) without any fine - tuning of the @xmath6 parameters .",
    "in other words , the stabilisation is achieved without sacrificing the conditions necessary to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "+ besides offering explanations to the problems beyond the standard model of particle physics , the rs model has attracted the attention of cosmologists due to its unique interpretation of the cosmological constant fine tuning problem .",
    "therefore , over the last decade , various cosmological and astrophysical issues like galaxy formation , existence of anisotropies in cosmic microwave background , dark energy and dark matter , black hole formation have been extensively studied in the context of the rs two - brane model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ in the present paper , we consider the effective , on  brane , scalar - tensor theories formulated by kanno and soda @xcite where the radion field , which measures the inter - brane separation between the visible brane and the planck brane is not a constant quantity .",
    "in fact , while studying the cosmological solution on the visible or the planck brane , the radion is taken as a time dependent field .",
    "similarly , for spherically symmetric , static on - brane geometries , the radion field depends on the radial coordinate .",
    "the spatial or temporal dependence of the radion therefore leads to the requirement that it must be non - zero everywhere in order to avoid brane collisions .",
    "we are able to demonstrate that by assuming the existence of on - brane matter , a stable non - zero distance between the branes is possible .    in the next section we provide an overview of the effective scalar - tensor theories proposed by kanno and soda @xcite .",
    "subsequently in section iii , we deal with cosmological solutions and in section iv we look at spherically symmetric solutions . in the last section",
    ", we provide our summary and conclusions .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the low energy effective theory on a @xmath0-brane developed by kanno and soda @xcite in the context of the two - brane model developed by randall and sundrum .",
    "the two @xmath0-branes being @xmath7 symmetric are located at orbifold fixed points @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that the geometry under consideration in this model is : @xmath10 .",
    "our universe is assumed to be on the visible @xmath0-brane which is a hypersurface embedded in a five dimensional ads bulk filled with only a @xmath3 bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the bulk curvature scale is @xmath11 .",
    "typically , in the rs model , the einstein equations are determined by keeping the inter - brane distance fixed and considering a flat @xmath0-brane .",
    "however , the scenario drastically changes once the inter - brane separation distance or the proper length becomes a function of the spacetime co - ordinates and the on - brane geometry is curved .",
    "these generalizations are incorporated while deriving the effective equations of motion on a @xmath0-brane @xcite . beginning with @xcite",
    "there has been a lot of work on the effective einstein equations on the brane under various assumptions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the effective equations for the two - brane system as obtained in @xcite has also been re - derived in a different approach in @xcite .",
    "an interesting recent work on slanted warped extra dimensions and its phenomenological consequences appeared in @xcite .    in order to determine the effective theory , we assume the following five dimensional action and a five dimensional metric with a spacetime varying proper distance between the two @xmath0 branes .",
    "the action functional is given as s = d^5 x ( _ r _ + ) -_i = a , b__i _ d^4 x + _ i = a , b d^4 x l^_i__matter where the tensions on the planck brane and visible brane are respectively given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us consider the most general @xmath14d line element , ds^2=e^2 ( x ) dy^2 + g_(y , x^)dx^ dx^ where @xmath15 is five dimensional gravitational coupling constant .",
    "since both cosmological and astrophysical solutions that we consider in the present case occur at energy scales much lower than that of the planck scale , therefore in the effective theory approach the brane curvature radius @xmath16 is much large compared to bulk curvature @xmath11 . as a result , perturbation theory can be used with a dimensionless perturbation parameter @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "this method , called the gradient approximation scheme , is a metric - based iterative method in which the bulk metric and extrinsic curvature are expanded with increasing order of @xmath17 in perturbation theory .",
    "the effective einstein equations on a brane are determined with the solutions of these quantities and the junction conditions . in this method ,",
    "the rs fine tuning condition is reproduced at the zeroth order when the inter - brane separation is constant and the two @xmath0-branes are characterised by opposite brane tensions . the effective einstein equations are then obtained at the first order incorporating non - zero contributions of the radion field and brane matter . using the gradient expansion scheme ,",
    "the effective einstein equations on the visible brane are as follows : @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the proper distance between the branes which in general is a spacetime dependent quantity .",
    "@xmath22 is the @xmath3 gravitational coupling constant .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 are the matter on the planck brane and the visible brane respectively . all covariant derivatives in the above expression are defined w.r.t .",
    "the metric on the visible brane ( denoted by the superscript ` b ' ) given by @xmath25 .",
    "+ the proper distance , a spacetime dependent function , between the two @xmath0-branes in the interval @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined as : d(x)= ^l_0e^(x ) dy and the corresponding equation of motion of the scalar field on the negative tension brane is given by , @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are traces of energy momentum tensors on planck brane and visible brane respectively .",
    "the coupling function @xmath29 in terms of @xmath30 can be expressed as , @xmath31    it is however known that the gravity on both the branes are not independent .",
    "the dynamics on the planck brane situated at @xmath8 is related to that of the visible brane by the following transformation @xcite : ( x)= where @xmath32 is the radion field defined on planck brane .",
    "now , the induced metric on the visible brane can be expressed in terms of @xmath32 as , g^b - brane_=(1 - ) [ h _",
    "+ g^(1)_(h _ , , t^a_,t^b_,y = l ) ] where @xmath33 is the first order correction term .",
    "+ it is to be noted that in the subsequent calculations we will assume that the on - brane stress energy is present only on the ` b ' brane i.e. on the visible brane .",
    "an important feature of the effective equations given above is that unlike the ones derived in @xcite there is no non - local contribution ( bulk - weyl - dependent @xmath34 @xcite ) from bulk geometry .",
    "in order to study the cosmological solution on the negative tension , visible brane , we assume the radion field to be time dependent .",
    "therefore , the proper distance between the orbifold fixed points i , e .",
    "@xmath8 to @xmath9 is given by , d(t)=_y=0^y = le^(t)dy = l e^(t ) the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solutions of the einstein equations can be obtained for three different types of spatial curvature , @xmath35 . in this section ,",
    "we study the solutions corresponding to each of these values of @xmath36 separately .",
    "the frw metric with a non - zero spatial curvature is given by : ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t)[lin_ele ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the radial co - ordinates and @xmath40 is the scale factor to be determined .",
    "substituting the above metric in eqn.([ee ] ) , the einstein s equations with spatial curvature @xmath36 are obtained as follows : 3()^2 + 3 + + = [ 20 ] 2 + ( ) ^2 + - - = ( -+ 3p ) - [ 9 ] and the scalar field equation is given by : @xmath41 where an overdot represents derivative with respect to time @xmath42 .",
    "it is to be noted that eqn.([9 ] ) is obtained by substituting ( [ 8 ] ) in @xmath43 component of the einstein s equations .",
    "the scalar field equation is found to be independent of spatial curvature @xmath36 and hence the equation remains same for any value of @xmath36 .",
    "however , the scalar field profile is different for different @xmath36 values due to the different functional forms of @xmath40 .",

    "therefore when @xmath46 , eqn.([8 ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of first integral of the @xmath30 equation .",
    "the scalar field equation reduces to : ^2 = ( 1 + ) [ 3 ] after substituting @xmath47 and @xmath46 in eqn.([20 ] ) , eqn.([9 ] ) and adding the two equations we get , + ( ) ^2=0 [ 4 ] integrating eqn.([4 ] ) we get , a(t ) = now , we can choose the dimensionful factor @xmath48 by a scaling choice , so that the solution of scale factor is re - written as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant of integration . substituting eqn.([3 ] ) and the scale factor into eqn.([20 ] ) ( with @xmath47 ) and then integrating it gives the solution for time dependent scalar field as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a non - zero constant with dimensions of @xmath53 .",

    "the above solution indicates that the scale factor has a decelerating ( but expanding ) nature and the scalar field approaches zero in the later time whereas it is large in the early universe .",
    "the obtained solution is similar to that of the frw radiation  dominated universe .",
    "however , @xmath56 , which measures the inter - brane distance , tends to zero in the limit @xmath58 thereby indicating an instability .",
