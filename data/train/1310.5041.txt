    "<S> abstract : the gallagher - moszkowski rule in the spectroscopy of odd - odd nuclei imposes a new spin constraint on the energy functionals for self - consistent mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the commonly used parameterization of the effective three - body interaction in the gogny and skyrme families of energy functionals is ill - suited to satisfy the spin constraint . in particular , the gogny parameterization of the three - body interaction has the opposite spin dependence to that required by the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body part has a correct sign , but in combination the rule is violated as often as not . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a new functional form is needed for the effective three - body interaction that can take into better account the different spin - isospin channels of the interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear energy density functionals have reached a mature state with respect to the parameterization of time - even fields required for the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory of ground state properties of even - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> a theory encompassing nuclei with odd numbers of nucleons requires a good understanding of the time - odd fields as well . </S>",
    "<S> some aspects of the time - odd fields have been examined in the literature @xcite , but important experimental information has been ignored in determining the parameters in the functionals . in particular , the spin dependence of the neutron - proton interaction is crucial to determine ground - state spins of odd - odd nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we will show in this letter that an energy functional from the gogny family of functionals strongly violates an empirical rule for determine ground state spins . </S>",
    "<S> the gogny functional has a very specific form for an effective three - body interaction which automatically has the wrong sign for the spin dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the other leading family of functionals , based on skyrme s parameterization , has the same form for spatial dependence of the effective three - body interaction , and is likely to have the similar difficulties . indeed , it was shown long ago that the contact parameterization could lead to instabilities in nuclear hartree - fock theory@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the rule that should be respected was formulated by gallagher and moszkowski ( gm ) @xcite for the quasiparticle angular momentum couplings in strongly deformed odd - odd nuclei . under those conditions the components of the angular momentum @xmath0 of the odd nucleons about the symmetry axis are good quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the two possible relative spin orientations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 give rise to two separate rotational bands having band - head angular momentum @xmath3 . according to the rule @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the oriention with parallel intrinsic spins is the lower energy band . as documented in a review of the gm rule @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there are only rare exceptions to the rule .    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed new code to find the hartree - fock - bogoliubov minima of the gogny functional in axially symmetric nuclei , treating for the first time time - odd fields including the spin - dependent ones @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> applying the code to spin splittings in deformed nuclei , we found that the predicted splittings violated the gm rule more often than not . </S>",
    "<S> in retrospect , the result is not too surprising because as stated earlier none of the energy functionals in common use have been fitted to spin - dependent properties .    </S>",
    "<S> we now examine the origin of the results . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to distinguish the two - particle interaction and the three - particle interaction present in the functionals . in principle </S>",
    "<S> there are enough degrees of freedom in the parameterization of the two - particle interaction to take into account the gm splittings . </S>",
    "<S> however , the three - particle interaction is essential for nuclear saturation and , for computational simplicity , it has a very constrained parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it is a density - dependent contact interaction in both the skyrme and gogny functionals of the form t_3 ( 1 + x p _ ) ( r_1-r_2 ) ( ( r_1+r_2)/2)^in the standard notation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is further restricted to the parallel - spin interaction ( @xmath4 ) in the gogny functionals . </S>",
    "<S> it must be repulsive to saturate nuclear matter , but it ca nt have a significant antiparallel - spin component because that channel requires an attractive interaction overall to produce bcs pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> we now illustrate the problem with a well - known example , the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the odd nucleons in ground band have angular momenta and parities @xmath5 for the proton and neutron respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to nilsson orbitals @xmath6\\downarrow_p$ ] and @xmath7\\uparrow_n$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spins are parallel for antiparallel orbital angular momentum , i.e. @xmath8 . indeed , the ground state band has @xmath9 in agreement with the gallagher - moszkowski rule . </S>",
    "<S> the other coupling of angular momenta , @xmath10 , is associated with an excited band with a band head at 171 kev excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental levels are compared with the hfb calculations in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . we first show the spectra of neighboring odd - a nuclei on the lefthand and middle panels . in the middle one , </S>",
    "<S> the theory confirmed the ground band assignment of a quasiparticle in the @xmath11\\uparrow_n$ ] nilsson orbital . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theory does not predict the correct ordering of the proton quasiparticle energies , shown in the left - hand panel . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12\\downarrow_p [ 512]\\uparrow_n$ ] appear as excited states in the theoretical spectrum of the , shown in the right - hand panel . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the level ordering is opposite to the experimental , with the @xmath13 band head below the @xmath14 , thus violating the gm rule .    to understand to theoretical splittings in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , we separate three contributions : 1 ) the spin dependence of the two - body interaction , treating the interaction in first - order perturbation theory 2 ) the spin dependence of the density - dependent interaction , again treating it perturbatively 3 ) the many - body rearrangement effects associated with the wave function modifications in the two - quasiparticle state . </S>",
    "<S> the three contributions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 kev for the two - particle and three - particle perturbative contributions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rearrange contribution is @xmath17 kev , giving a total splitting of @xmath18 kev as shown in the level scheme in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with an empirical value of @xmath19 , which is what is left of the observed splitting of @xmath20 after the rotational effects have been removed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as claimed earlier , the three - particle contribution has a bad sign and here it even overwhelms the good sign of the two - particle contribution .    to see how general these findings are </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed this analysis on 100 - 225 doublets in each of 15 nuclei in the deformed rare - earth region . </S>",
    "<S> all of these nuclei have strong prolate deformations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in table i.    .[systematics]theoretical spin splittings of neutron - proton configurations for odd - odd nuclei in the rare earth region . </S>",
    "<S> for each nucleus , two - quasiparticle states were constructed taking 10 to 15 proton quasiparticle orbitals and a like number of neutron quasiparticle orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the table shows the percentage of the cases in which the calculated splitting agrees with the gm rule , combining the results for several isotopes of each element . </S>",
    "<S> columns labeled 2bp , 3bp , and fp show the perturbative results for the two - body interaction alone , the three - body interaction alone , and the full interaction treated perturbatively . the last column shows the results of the fully self - consistent calculation of the hfb minima . the table shows the results for the d1s interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also have calculated splittings with the d1 m interactions @xcite and found similar results . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results confirm the statements made earlier that : the two - body interaction has a correct sign ; the three - body interaction has the wrong sign ; and the net sign with all the contributions is variable and inconsistent with a general gm rule .    to gain a better understanding of the origin of the problem we briefly </S>",
    "<S> review how the interaction energies are calculated using the one - body densities of hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> when time - reversal symmetry is broken the one body - density matrix can be decomposed as the sum of a time - even and a time - odd density . in the expression of the total energy </S>",
    "<S> there is a contribution which is quadratic in the time - odd term . starting from an even - even hfb reference state </S>",
    "<S> , the blocking of a given quasiparticle leads to a non - zero time odd density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the blocking of the time reversed state leads to the same time odd density but with opposite sign . to build the two configurations defining a gm pair a proton quasiparticle with quantum number @xmath21 and a neutron one with @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> are blocked to obtain one of the states . </S>",
    "<S> the other is obtained by blocking @xmath23 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> both the spin parallel and antiparallel configurations are considered into orbital and spin components , @xmath24 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the time - odd proton densities of both configurations are the same in absolute value but have opposite signs whereas the two time odd neutron densities are the same . from these considerations it becomes clear that only those terms of the energy depending on the product of a time odd proton density times a time odd neutron one are contributing to the energy splitting of the doublet . among the different terms contributing to the energy in the gogny interaction </S>",
    "<S> there are a few that do not contribute to the splitting , namely the wigner term of the central potential , the coulomb potential and the pairing channel of the central potential . among the remaining terms , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit contribution is much smaller than the other two and will be omitted in the discussion . therefore the splitting of the doublet is dominated by the central two - body and three - body contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the perturbative contribution to the splitting starting a wave function at the hfb minimum of an even - even nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the required quasiparticles are then blocked and the expection value of the energy is calculated . as an example , the three - body contribution to the splitting is given by e = e ( , ) - e ( , ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ordinary density , a function of @xmath27 alone . </S>",
    "<S> the needed time - odd component of the density matrix @xmath28 depends on nucleon type @xmath29 and spin projection @xmath30 as well . </S>",
    "<S> the bar denotes the modulus of a ( complex ) density . </S>",
    "<S> if the blocked quasiparticle is bcs - like ( i.e. linear combinations of creation and annihilation canonical basis states ) then the time - odd density @xmath31 is diagonal in the canonical basis with zeroes in the diagonal except for the blocked orbital quantum number where it takes the value @xmath32 depending on whether the spin @xmath33 of the blocked orbital points up or down . in this very specific case only taking place at the first iteration ( first order ) the density @xmath34 is zero and @xmath35 equals @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath37 as defined above is positive for parallel spins and negative for antiparallel ones , just the opposite of the gm rule . in the actual hfb calculation </S>",
    "<S> the blocked quasiparticle may have a mixture of the two spin orientations and the simple argument given above may fail . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs for some configurations treated in the table .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also of interest to examine the various interactions in a momentum space representation . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant plane - wave matrix elements of the two - body gogny interaction are given by _ </S>",
    "<S> ^np = ^3/2_i=1 ^ 2 _ i^3 ( w_i + b_i + ( h_i+m_i)e^-(q _ i)^2 ) _ ^np = ^3/2_i=1 ^ 2 _ i^3 ( w_i + m_ie^-(q _ </S>",
    "<S> i)^2 ) in the notation of ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum @xmath38 is the relative momentum of the two nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> we now make a qualitative connection with the energy difference for the two spin couplings of nucleons , changing the momentum of the proton at the same time as its spin is flipped . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> [ deltav ] v^2b = ^3/2_i=1 ^ 2 _ i^3 ( b_i + ( h_i+m_i ) e^-(q_p _ i)^2 -m_i e^-(q_a _ i)^2 ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding difference of matrix elements for the three - body interaction is independent of @xmath41 and is given by v^3b = t_3 ^. these differences for nucleons on the fermi surface are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 as a function of @xmath42 , taking the fermi momentum    as @xmath43 @xmath44 . in the left - hand panel </S>",
    "<S> one see that the two components have opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> they are added together in the plot on the right . here </S>",
    "<S> one can see that both signs are present , depending on the angle @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> in that plot we also show an empirical neutron - proton interaction , constructed to fit the data on the gm multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are in rough agreement when the momenta in the parallel - spin state are also parallel , but strongly disagree when the momenta are anti - parallel in that state .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with some remarks the construction of a better three - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it seems clear that the contact nature of the gogny ( and skyrme ) interactions is at the root of the problem of reproducing the empirical spin - dependence of the neutron - proton interaction . </S>",
    "<S> there have been proposals in the literature to generalize the three - body interaction by including derivative terms@xcite as in the skyrme two - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the expansion in powers of the derivatives gives rise to many terms and it is difficult from a purely empirical point of view to determine the coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction arises both from the subnucleon degrees of freedom that are missing from theory as well as from the correlations that are missing from the mean - field treatment of the nucleon degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , called the induced three - body interaction , has a long range @xcite and a nonlocality @xcite that is impossible to take account of in a contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a finite range has to be introduced in some fashion , but the computational cost is very high . besides the skyrme approach using derivatives of contact interactions , it may be possible to reduce the computational cost of finite - range three - body interactions using hypercontraction@xcite or separable parameterizations . </S>",
    "<S> we feel it would be very worthwhile to develop codes that could apply them </S>"
