    "dynamically unstable centaurs are minor planets that cross or have crossed orbits with giant planets .",
    "the exact definition of the centaur differs by references . for example",
    ", the definition at the minor planet center - mpc / iau is that the centaurs are celestial bodies with perihelion beyond the orbit of jupiter and with semi - major axes smaller than that of neptune . in contrast , the jpl / nasa defines the centaurs as objects with semi - major axes between 5.5 au and 30.1 au . since the discovery of the first centaur 2060 chiron @xcite , a number of centaurs have been detected .",
    "@xcite estimated the total number of centaurs with a diameter larger than 1 km is approximately 44,000 .",
    "the sources of the centaurs are thought to be either the classical kuiper belt @xcite , the scattered disk @xcite or the oort cloud @xcite , and their dynamical lifetime is estimated to be @xmath5 years @xcite .",
    "+ recent occultation observations revealed the existence of narrow ring systems around the centaurs 10199 chariklo and 2060 chiron @xcite .",
    "these discoveries prompt us to ask about their dynamical origin as well as their presence only between jupiter and neptune .",
    "several models for the formation of ring systems around the centaurs have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) collisional ejection from the parent body s surface , ( 2 ) disruption of primordial satellite , and ( 3 ) dusty outgassing .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed ring formation by the lofting of dust particles off chariklo s surface into orbit via outflows of sublimating co , and predicted that rings should be common among large centaurs but absent among small comets and large kuiper belt objects . in this work",
    ", we propose an alternative dynamical process that can form rings around a centaur via its extremely close encounters with a giant planet .",
    "we perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations and show that partial tidal disruption of a differentiated centaur can form a ring - satellite system around it . in section 2 , we briefly discuss the encounter states of centaurs and their likelihood of encountering giant planets . in section 3 ,",
    "our numerical methods are explained .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , our conclusions and discussions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this work , we propose that rings around centaurs could form during a single extremely close encounter with one of the giant planets .",
    "the outcome of the close encounter depends on pericenter distance and relative velocity at infinity between the giant planet and the passing object @xcite . in the following subsections",
    ", we will briefly discuss dynamical parameters for the possible encounters of centaurs with giant planets .      under the gravitational effects of giant planets , the orbits of centaurs",
    "are chaotic and their orbital elements change during their dynamical lifetime @xcite .",
    "thus , the orbital elements of centaurs can take on a wide range of values on the semi - major axis ( @xmath6)-eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) plane ( figure [ figure1 ] left top panel ) .",
    "tidal effects on a passing object at a close encounter depend on the relative velocity at infinity and the distance of the closest approach . assuming that a giant planet is moving on a circular orbit and a centaur is orbiting on the same orbital plane with the giant planet , the encounter velocity becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radial and azimuthal components of the velocity of the centaur at the heliocentric distance @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the keplerian velocity of the giant planet whose semi - major axis is @xmath11 , respectively . from the conservation of energy and angular momentum",
    ", we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the gravitational constant and the mass of the sun , respectively .",
    "then , the velocity components are derived as a function of the orbital elements as @xmath17 and @xmath18    figure [ figure1 ] shows the encounter velocities of the known centaurs with either saturn , uranus or neptune .",
    "the velocity depends on the orbital elements as well as giant planets , and can take on a variety of values between @xmath19 km s@xmath3 .",
    "close encounters with giant planets would occur at two hypothetical epochs ; ( a ) during the initial encounter with neptune , it scatters kbos into the centaur region , and ( b ) during the crossing with one of the giant planets after a body is scattered from the kuiper belt to the centaur region and becomes a member of the centaur population . in order to form rings around the centaur during a close encounter ,",
    "the centaur at least needs to pass within the planet s roche limit .",
    "@xcite calculated the orbits of chariklo clones backward and forward in time and show that they can experience multiple extreme close encounters ( within @xmath20 planetary radii ) with giant planets during their lifetime .",
    "@xcite calculated the orbits of the known centaurs and found that @xmath21% of the objects impact one of the giant planets .",
    "thus , scaling from their number , the fraction of centaurs that passes within the roche limit ( @xmath22 times of planetary radii ) becomes about @xmath23 or larger .",
    "here we investigate how a close encounter with a giant planet may form a debris disk around a centaur .",
    "using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method , we perform simulations of close encounters of a differentiated body with a giant planet , where the planet is represented by a point mass .",
    "the sph method is a lagrangian method @xcite in which hydrodynamic equations are solved by considering averaged values of particles through kernel - weighted summation .",
    "we ignore the elastic strength , but include the mutual gravity between constituent particles ; such an assumption is relevant for bodies larger than several hundred kilometers .",
    "we use the tillotson equation of state @xcite to calculate the pressure from the internal energy and density . for the artificial viscosity",
    ", we use a von neumann - richtmyer - type viscosity with the standard parameter sets ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "our numerical code is the same as that used in @xcite , which was developed in @xcite .",
    "+ according to a recent three - dimensional thermal evolution model , trans - neptunian objects and centaurs could be strongly differentiated and forming stratified internal structures due to the heating by short - lived radioactive isotopes whose amount depends on the timing of their formation @xcite . if the centaurus formed within 1 myr , the body with a radius larger than 10 km should be differentiated @xcite in this work , we assume that the object is differentiated with either 50wt% or 20wt% of a silicate core covered by a water ice mantle with a total mass of @xmath26 kg .",
    "the object consists of 100,000 sph particles .",
    "initial positions and velocities of all the particles that follow a hyperbolic orbit around saturn are given analytically with initial distance to the planet being set to @xmath27 km , which is about twice as long as the roche limit of water ice material .",
    "this starting point is large enough to neglect the tidal effect of the planet @xcite .",
    "the hyperbolic orbit is entirely determined by the pericenter distance @xmath28 and the velocity at infinity @xmath29 . in this work ,",
    "we explore different values of pericenter distances within the planet s roche limit , and the values of the velocity at infinity are chosen from the range @xmath30 km s@xmath3 or @xmath31 km s@xmath3 , which are expected for the known centaurs ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we also investigate the dependence on the initial spin state of the passing objects .",
    "the spin - axis of the body is assumed to be perpendicular to the orbital plane with either prograde or retrograde spin to the direction of the hyperbolic orbit with the spin period @xmath32h .",
    "such a rotation period is common in the trans - neptunian belt @xcite .",
    "the critical distance for tidal disruption can be scaled by the planet s roche limit @xcite .",
    "thus , the dependence on the pericenter distance here is shown by scaling with the planet s roche limit @xmath33 for mantle material , so that our results can also be applicable to other giant planets . + as shown in the next section , part of the material scattered around the object after the close encounter becomes gravitationally bound around the central body ( the largest remnant produced after the encounter ) , and these bound particles have highly eccentric orbits immediately after the encounter .",
    "however , collisions between the particles rapidly damp the eccentricities and inclinations and form a disk of particles on nearly circular orbits while conserving the angular momentum .",
    "thus , we calculate the equivalent circular orbital radius @xmath34 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the post - encounter semi - major axis and eccentricity of a disk particle , respectively .",
    "then , the total mass of the particles that is gravitationally captured by the central body and satisfies @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the radius of the body ) is regarded as the ring mass .",
    "our numerical simulations are stopped when the disk mass becomes almost constant .",
    "during an extreme close encounter with a giant planet , the tidal force significantly spins up in a prograde direction and deforms the passing object .",
    "when an object passes too deep inside the potential field of the giant planet , strong tides homogeneously stretch and destroy not only the mantle , but also the core that splits into several small clumps of similar size without forming a ring around a central remnant @xcite . however , when objects experience weaker tides at slightly larger pericenter distance , the core is not fully destroyed and only the icy mantle is preferentially stripped off from the surface and distributed around the largest remnant , resulting in the formation of a ring that is a mixture of ice and silicate .",
    "the outcomes of this destruction are diverse depending on the initial state ( internal structure , spin ) of the incoming body and the geometry of the encounter ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "we performed additional sph simulations for the case of undifferentiated bodies .",
    "we found that ring formation is difficult for the undifferentiated bodies , since the roche limit of the largest remnant becomes too small to capture debris during tidal disruption at the close encounter . + within our limited calculations with @xmath37 or @xmath38 km s@xmath3 , 20wt% or 50wt% silicate core and initial spin period @xmath32h in either prograde or retrograde direction , when the body passes at a distance between @xmath39 , the outcome is ringed objects . the resultant ring s mass is @xmath4% of the mass of the central object and mostly distributed within the roche limit ( figure [ figure3 ] ) . within the range of these parameters ,",
    "when the tides are strong enough ( inner edge of the parameter range at each combination of @xmath29 , spin period and internal structure ) , even core material is incorporated into the ring ( figure [ figure2 ] top panels ) in addition to the icy mantle .",
    "in contrast , when the tides are slightly weaker , only the icy mantle is destroyed and pure icy rings or disks are formed ( figure [ figure2 ] bottom panels ) . furthermore , not only does this form debris rings , but , in some cases , part of the progenitor s mantle is also directly split into small icy moons ( figure [ figure2 ] bottom panels ) . note that , these moons usually have highly eccentric orbits around the central object , and thus investigation on their longer - term evolution is required in order to understand the successive dynamical evolution of their ring - satellite systems . + as the pericenter distance becomes larger , the outcome is less destructive , generally forming less massive disks ( see black circle or square points in figure [ figure3 ] right top panel ) .",
    "however , when moons are directly formed by splitting of the mantle , larger total mass ( disk mass + mass of the moons ) orbits around the central object ( see figure [ figure2 ] bottom panels and the corresponding black triangle @xmath40 or blue circle @xmath41 in figure [ figure3 ] right top panel ) . such direct moon formation might be the typical outcome in the case of a small core and large pericenter distance .",
    "the outcome also depends on the internal structures , initial spin states and velocity at infinity . for a smaller fraction of the silicate core , faster prograde spin or smaller value of velocity at infinity ,",
    "the encounter becomes more destructive , and thus ring formation can occur at larger pericenter distances . during the close encounter",
    ", the object is spun up in the prograde direction and as the pericenter distance becomes larger , the object is less spun - up ( figure [ figure3 ] left bottom panel ) .",
    "the critical spin period against its self - gravity is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44h and @xmath45h for water ice ( @xmath46 kg m@xmath47 ) and silicate ( @xmath48 kg m@xmath47 ) , respectively . the resultant spin periods of the largest bodies in our simulations are about @xmath49h ( figure [ figure3 ] bottom left panel ) .",
    "interestingly , these final spin periods are rather similar to those of chariklo and chiron , which are @xmath50h and @xmath51h , respectively .",
    "+ after their formation , the rings are expected to spread and accrete into moon(s ) outside the roche limit of the hosting body @xcite .",
    "then , collisions between formed moons just outside the roche limit would result in the formation of a narrow ring and shepherd moons as in the case of the formation of saturn s f ring and its shepherds @xcite .",
    "alternatively , moons formed by directly splitting from the progenitor s mantle during the encounters might shape the debris rings in a longer - term evolution .",
    "such successive dynamical evolution may explain the observed narrow ring structures around chariklo and chiron .",
    "however , more detailed direct numerical simulations are required to fully understand the stochastic nature of the ring - satellite system evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the centaurs are transient objects that cross the orbits of one or several giant planets . during their short dynamical lifetime ( @xmath5 years )",
    ", they frequently undergo close encounters with giant planets .",
    "motivated by recent discoveries of the ringed large centaurs , 10199 chariklo and 2060 chiron , we performed sph simulations in order to investigate possible outcomes of tidal disruption of a differentiated large centaur during an extremely close encounter with a giant planet .",
    "+ we found that the outcomes of the close encounters depend on the initial spin state and the internal structure of the passing object .",
    "when the passing body has a 20wt% or 50wt% dense core , an initial spin period @xmath32h in either prograde or retrograde direction and its initial orbit has a pericenter distance of @xmath52 with @xmath37 or @xmath38 km s@xmath3 , our sph simulations show that the close encounter naturally results in the formation of debris rings around the largest remnant . in such cases , the icy mantle is preferentially stripped off during the close encounter and mostly distributed within the roche limit of the largest remnant without significant disruption of the silicate core .",
    "thus , the resultant ring composition becomes either pure water ice or the mixture of water ice and a small amount of silicate . in some cases , not only the formation of the rings but also small moons are formed directly by splitting from the mantle or the core . in order to form rings , the tidal force should not be too strong or too weak .",
    "when it is too strong , the objects are homogeneously stretched / destroyed and form similar sized smaller clumps @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when the tidal force is too weak , the passing body remains intact .",
    "the outcome also depends on the internal structure of the passing body .",
    "we find that the existence of a dense core helps the formation of the rings . without the core",
    ", the outcome tends to be splitting into several clumps .",
    "thus , if our scenario is correct , chariklo and chiron should be differentiated . however , more detailed investigations are necessary to fully understand the range of initial orbital parameters as well as the internal structure of the passing centaurs that can form ringed remnant objects after the close encounters .",
    "we will leave these questions to our future work . as discussed in section 2.2 ,",
    "simple analytical estimation provides us about 10% of all centaurs can boast ring - satellite systems . however , current observation is not enough to have a good statistic .",
    "so far , we know chariklo and chiron are only ringed centaurs",
    ". however , future occultations may be able to detect more rings or orbiting features .",
    "+ in our present calculations , we found that the mass of the formed rings is @xmath4% of the mass of the largest remnant body and the disk materials are mostly distributed within the roche limit of the body .",
    "such rings spread , forming satellite(s ) outside the roche limit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , collisional disruption between formed moons just outside the roche limit would create a narrow ring and shepherd satellites @xcite .",
    "therefore , the currently observed / suggested narrow ring systems around chariklo or chiron might be the outcomes of such dynamical evolution after the ring formation by tidal disruption .",
    "alternatively , moons that would have formed directly by splitting from the icy mantle or cores would have shaped the remnant rings .",
    "therefore , in addition to rings as revealed by recent observations for chariklo and chiron , our results suggest that a significant fraction of centaurs should have small moon(s ) awaiting discovery .",
    "direct simulations of the longer - term evolution are required to clarify the evolution of the ring - satellite system . +",
