    "general relativity is a powerful tool to explain theoretically many observational facts about the universe . despite all the successes , there are also some unresolved problems such as inflation , the cosmological constant problem and the problems associated with the dark sector , i.e. , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "these problems have motivated people to seek for some modifications of the theory . among many possibilities ,",
    "much attention has been paid in recent years to two classes of modified gravity theories ; scalar - tensor theories @xcite in which gravity is described not only by a metric tensor but also by a scalar field and @xmath0 gravity theories @xcite in which @xmath2 in the gravitational action is replaced by the function @xmath0 .",
    "+ comparing with general relativity , these theories consider new degrees of freedom which open new possibilities for addressing the aforementioned problems . in scalar - tensor gravity ,",
    "one introduces a new dynamical scalar field and in @xmath0 gravity one considers forth order derivatives of the metric in the field equations .",
    "these modifications make the theories admit a larger variety of solutions than einstein equations in general relativity at the cost of increased complexity .",
    "this increased complexity together with nonlinearity make finding exact solutions for the field equations be much more difficult .",
    "+ despite the complexities , some cosmological exact solutions have been found in both classes . in scalar - tensor gravity ,",
    "exact solutions are usually given when the scalar field has no potential function @xcite .",
    "there are also exact solutions for some functional forms of the potential such as power - law potential @xcite and exponential potential when coupling of the scalar field is minimal @xcite . in power - law @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "exact solutions have been reported in homogenous and isotropic cosmology in @xcite @xcite . in the present work we are looking for exact solutions in the two modified gravity models with a different approach .",
    "we start with einstein frame representation of a general scalar - tensor gravity in which there is an interaction between the scalar field and matter systems .",
    "this representation is the same for all @xmath0 gravities and all parameterizations of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "different gravitational theories are characterized by their potential , their coupling functions and the coupling strengths ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the following ) .",
    "we introduce general exact solutions of the gravitational models for which the coupling strength takes constant values . + the plan of the paper is the following : in section 2 , we first consider the action of a general scalar - tensor theory in einstein frame in which the matter system is taken to be a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state .",
    "we then write the corresponding field equations in a homogenous and isotropic cosmology describing by the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "we assume spacetimes with zero spatial geometries .",
    "the matter system and the scalar field are not separately conserved due to the interaction and there is an energy flow between the two components .",
    "direction of the energy flow depends on the coupling strength and the equation of state of the fluid . for an equation of state corresponding to radiation",
    "there is no interaction and hence no energy flow . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the solutions of the field equations by direct integration .",
    "we first solve the continuity equation for the matter system .",
    "the solution indicates that evolution of the matter energy density is modified due to the interaction .",
    "we can consider this modification as a modification of the exponent of the scale factor by an arbitrary function @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath5 measures the energy exchange between the matter and the scalar field .",
    "this leads to a relation between the scalar field and the scale factor .",
    "a relevant role is played by this relation to reduce the second order differential equation of the scalar field to a first order one for obtaining the potential function .",
    "we will show that exact solutions can be obtained when @xmath5 and the coupling strength take constant values and for exponential forms of the potential .",
    "we argue that this procedure can be applied to power - law @xmath0 gravity and some scalar - tensor gravities such as bd theory . in section 4",
    ", we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the action functional @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the gravitational constant and @xmath9 is the action of some matter field @xmath10 .",
    "the function @xmath3 is a coupling function that characterizes coupling of the scalar field @xmath11 with the matter sector .",
    "the action ( [ b4 ] ) may be taken as einstein frame representation of a generalized scalar - tensor gravity or an @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "+ variation of this action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath12 , leads to @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 are stress - tensors of the scalar field and the matter system .",
    "variation with respect to the scalar field @xmath11 , gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the two stress - tensors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not separately conserved .",
    "instead they satisfy the following equations @xmath21 we apply the field equations in a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic cosmology described by frw spacetime @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scale factor . to do this",
    ", we take @xmath19 as the stress - tensor of a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 . in this case , the gravitational equations ( [ b7 ] ) takes the form @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and overdot indicates differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath30 . combining these equations ,",

    "the direction of energy transfer depends on the sign of @xmath38 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the energy transfer is from the scalar field ( dark energy ) and the subsequent field equations are similar to those of some interacting models in which there is an interaction between dark energy and ( dark ) matter @xcite . in those models ,",

    "the equation ( [ b17 ] ) can be easily solved @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is an integration constant .",
    "this solution indicates that the evolution of energy density is modified due to interaction of @xmath11 with matter .",
    "there will be no loss of generality if we write ( [ c1 ] ) as @xmath45 with @xmath5 being defined by @xmath46 even though @xmath47 and the coupling strength @xmath48 in ( [ c2 - 1 ] ) are generally evolving functions , we will restrict ourselves to the case that they can be regarded as constant parameters . in this case ,",
    "( [ c2 - 1 ] ) reduces to @xmath49 with @xmath50 being a constant defined by the relation @xmath51 . the expression ( [ c3 ] )",
    "is similar to the rule presented by some authors for characterizing decaying law of vacuum energy into dark matter @xcite .",
    "it states that when @xmath52 , matter is created and energy is constantly injecting into the matter so that the latter will dilute more slowly compared to its standard evolution @xmath53 . similarly , when @xmath54 the reverse is true , namely that matter is annihilated and the direction of energy transfer is outside of the matter system so that the rate of dilution is faster than the standard one . + we will show that ( [ c2 ] ) actually satisfies ( [ b15 ] ) for some potentials .",
    "it is possible to find those potentials by solving a first order differential equation .",
    "there are two important cases that the function @xmath4 takes a constant configuration ; @xmath0 gravity and brans - dicke theory .",
    "we consider the two cases separately in the following :      the action for an @xmath0 gravity theory in jordan frame is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the metric in jordan frame .",
    "we consider a conformal transformation @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "this together with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , transforms ( [ b1 ] ) into the action ( [ b4 ] ) with a potential @xcite @xcite @xmath61 instead of solving the field equations for a given @xmath0 function ( or , equivalently , a given potential function ) , we are looking for those models that accept the solution ( [ c2 ] ) . in this way , one can reduce the second order differential equation of @xmath11 to a first order one for finding the functional form of @xmath62 . to do this , we first put ( [ c2 ] ) into ( [ b15 ] ) which leads to @xmath63 comparing the latter with ( [ b14 - 2 ] ) gives then a consistency relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",

    "thus the expression ( [ c2 ] ) is an exact solution of the field equations for the potential ( [ c6 ] ) . for @xmath70 , ( [ c6 ] ) is reduced to a single exponential potential corresponds to a double exponential potential which will be considered later . ]",

    "however when @xmath52 , there is a chance for @xmath79 and a contracting scale factor .",
    "this case happens when the energy flow from @xmath11 to matter is so strong that make the universe collapse . + to answer the question of how this solution is attributed to @xmath0 function , we should use a back mapping of our results to the jordan frame .",
    "one may use ( [ c2 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) to write @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 combining the latter two relations gives @xmath83 , scale factor in the jordan frame .",
    "for @xmath84 , scale factor has a power - law form both in einstein and jordan frames : @xmath85 @xmath86 these solutions indicate that even hough passing from one conformal frame to the other does not change the power - law behavior , it changes the exponents .",
    "however , in the case that @xmath87 , the exponents of the scale factor follow the standard evolution in the radiation and the dust phases in both conformal frames .",
    "+ the function @xmath0 depends crucially on the functional form of the potential @xmath62 . for a single exponential potential of the form ( [ c6 - 1 ] ) , the expression ( [ b5 ] ) gives a differential equation @xmath88/\\sigma}=\\frac{m_p^2}{2}(\\frac{r}{f'}-\\frac{f}{f'^2 } ) \\label{c9 - 3}\\ ] ] this has a simple power - law solution @xmath89 with @xmath90 being @xmath91 and @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 thus ( [ c9])-([c9 - 7 ] ) are exact solutions for power - law @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath90 is given in terms of two free parameters @xmath94 and @xmath50 ( or @xmath5 ) so that our solutions consider a much wider variety of solutions comparing with those obtained in @xcite .",
