    "zirconia ( zro@xmath0 ) is a material of great technological potential importance due to its outstanding mechanical and electrical properties , high dielectric constant and wide band gap . among the zro@xmath0 applications ,",
    "are : its use as gas sensors , solid fuel cells , high durability coating , catalytic agents , etc . in recent years",
    ", its gap ( @xmath4 ev )   and dielectric properties ( @xmath5 )   suggested its potential to replace sio@xmath0 in advanced metal oxide semiconductor devices ( mos ) in gate stack , dynamic access memory devices , and optical applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has a large band - offset in direct contact with si and good thermal stability .",
    "these attracting properties has led zirconia based oxides to be widely studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "zro@xmath0 presents polymorphism with monoclinic , tetragonal , and cubic phases .",
    "the monoclinic phase ( m - zro@xmath0 ) of undoped zro@xmath0 is thermodynamically stable at temperatures below 1170 @xmath6 .",
    "the tetragonal phase structure ( t - zro@xmath0 ) arises when heating zro@xmath0 , being stable between 1170 @xmath7 and 2370 @xmath8 , as well as above this ; through its melting point ( 2706 @xmath7 ) , the cubic phase ( c - zro@xmath0 ) is then observed .",
    "the temperature in which the tetragonal to cubic transformation occurs can be lowered , by the addition of solutes such as mgo , cao , y@xmath0o@xmath9 , allowing the achievement of the stabilized c - phase even at room temperature .",
    "previous investigations of zro@xmath0 , based on first - principles electronic structure calculations , have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of them dealt with the structural and electronic properties of zro@xmath0 , in its cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic phases @xcite . the zirconia optical properties , or more specifically its complex dielectric function has been addressed by french _",
    "et al _ ( electronic frequency regime only ) by carrying out _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations via the orthogonalized linear - combination - of - atomic - orbitals method @xcite , and more recently , by zhao and vanderbilt @xcite and by rignanese _ et al _ @xcite , by means of _ ab initio _ pseudopotential calculations .",
    "however , in the work of ref.@xcite only the zro@xmath0 cubic and tetragonal structural phases have been considered , while in that of ref.@xcite , although in the work all three phases ( cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic ) are studied , only the lattice contributions to the dielectric tensor have been addressed so far . moreover , in these studies , relativistic effects including the spin - orbit interaction were not taken into account in the calculations , neither have been provided values for the zro@xmath0 carrier effective masses , which are fundamental to model the tunnelling currents through floating gate memory devices that use , e.g. , zro@xmath0 as the tunnelling oxide .    in this work",
    ", we present results of state - of - the - art first - principles calculations for the structural , electronic , and optical properties of zro@xmath0 in its monoclinic , tetragonal , and cubic phases . from the band structures ,",
    "the zro@xmath0 conduction- and valence - band effective masses have been obtained , in the most important symmetry axis of the brillouin zone .",
    "the full - relativistic effects , properly taken into account in the calculations , are demonstrated to be relevant for a more precise evaluation of its electron- and hole - effective - mass values , as well as in the detailed structure of the electronic contribution to its frequency dependent dielectric function , ( @xmath10 ) . as a consequence of the role played by the inclusion of full - relativistic effects in the calculations ,",
    "the obtained changes in the reflectivity spectrum and refraction index are also significant .    in order to realistically obtain the value for the static dielectric constant @xmath11 , we also calculated the lattice contributions , mostly arising from the transverse optical phonon modes , to the low - frequency dielectric function , for the different phases .",
    "the resulting calculated static dielectric constant for m - zro@xmath0 is in excellent agreement with the values reported in the literature .",
    "moreover , the results obtained for the reflectivity and refraction index for its monoclinic phase are in good accordance with the available experimental data .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were carried out using the density - functional theory in the local - density approach ( dft - lda ) by means of the _ ab initio _ full - potential self - consistent linear augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method ( wien2k code @xcite ) . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "was adopted for the exchange - correlation potential @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been recently applied to study the structural , electronic , and optical properties of cubic srtio@xmath9 and hfo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the zirconium 4s-,4p-,4d-,and 5s , and the oxigen 2s,2p electrons were treated as part of the valence states .",
    "the cutoff angular momentum was @xmath12 for wave functions , and @xmath13 for charge densities and potentials inside the spheres .",
    "muffin - tin sphere radii were assumed equal for both zr and o. the number of symmetrized * k*-points , used as input for the self - consistent charge density determination , was 47 , 75 , and 100-*k * points in the irreducible symmetry wedge of the bz , respectively for the cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic phases .",
    "the value @xmath14 was adopted for the three different phases . with these assumptions ,",
    "the energy bands were converged within @xmath15  ev , and the total energy within @xmath16  ev .",
    "the core electron states were treated full - relativistically , whereas the valence states were treated both , non - relativistic and full - relativistically , i.e. including the spin - orbit interaction , besides the darwin and mass - velocity corrections .",
    "in addition , we have also used the dft - lda , with the plane - wave description of the wavefunctions , and the pseudopotential method ( _ abinit _ code   @xcite ) for the evaluation of the phonon contributions to the real part of the dielectric function ( @xmath17 ) , as will be discussed later . with this approach ,",
    "we are able to unveil and estimate the total value of the static dielectric constant of zro@xmath0 in the form @xmath11 = @xmath18 + @xmath19 , for the three phases cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic .",
    "the cubic zro@xmath0 phase ( c - zro@xmath0 ) belongs to the space group @xmath20 with crystalline structure of fluorite , i.e. face - centered cubic lattice with three atoms at the basis , being one zr atom at the position ( 0,0,0 ) and the oxygen atoms at the position ( @xmath21 , @xmath21 , @xmath21 ) , for which the bz is the usual 14-faces polyhedra .",
    "we have obtained through a total energy minimization process , a lattice constant value of the cubic phase @xmath22  , slightly larger than that calculated by krlik _ et al _ @xcite , using the pseudopotential method and the local density approximation ( lda ) , and closer to the experimental value of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the value obtained by us confirms that the gga approximation leads to lattice constant values which are slightly overestimated in relation to the experimental value .",
    "the tetragonal phase ( t - zro@xmath0 ) is described by the @xmath24 group . as shown by zhao and vanderbilt @xcite , the t - zro@xmath0 phase is obtained from the cubic one , by properly performing alternate displacements @xmath25 of the oxygen atoms in the cubic structure .",
    "our optimization process consisted in minimizing the total energy and forces , until `` converged '' @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 values have been reached .",
    "the obtained values were @xmath28  , @xmath29  , and the internal parameter d@xmath30 = @xmath31 , close to the experimental ones @xcite ( @xmath32  , @xmath33  , and d@xmath30 = 0.0574 ) , as well as close to the theoretical values reported by krlik _ at al . _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath34   and @xmath35    and d@xmath30 = 0.0423 ) .    for the monoclinic phase , which is described by the @xmath36 group , we have evaluated the total energy for several lattice constant values ,",
    "in order to have a good description of the equilibrium properties for the bulk m - zro@xmath37 , in which case , for sake of reducing computational time , we use the _ abinit _ code  @xcite .",
    "the results were fitted by the murnaghan equation of state , and we have obtained , for the monoclinic structure , @xmath38  , @xmath39  , @xmath40  , and @xmath41 = 99.6 degrees .",
    "these results are in accordance with the available experimental @xcite(@xmath42  , @xmath43  , @xmath44  , and @xmath41 = 99.23 degrees ) , and theoretical results @xcite(@xmath45  , @xmath46  , @xmath47  , and @xmath41 = 99.60 degrees ) .",
    "we have used the later ones in the band structure calculations performed with wien2k code , as well as to calculate effective mass values and optical properties for the monoclinic phase .",
    "table i presents the band gap energies , together with the valence - to - conduction band transition symmetry , for all three phases of zro@xmath0 . for the cubic phase ,",
    "the band gap is indirect at @xmath48 , with an energy of @xmath49  ev when a non - relativistic calculation is considered , and with energy of @xmath50  ev , if the calculations are performed by taking into account the full relativistic effects , i.e. the scalar - relativistic and spin - orbit effects .",
    "the direct band gap , at @xmath51 , is of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )  ev within a non - relativistic ( full - relativistic ) calculation .",
    "our values for the band gaps are very close to those obtained by krlik _",
    "@xcite , in which a pseudopotential lda method was used .",
    "we recall that , the theoretical values for the band gap energy are smaller when compared with the experimental one , due to the well - known underestimation of conduction band states energies in _ ab initio _ calculations which are performed within dft . experimental values , as reported by french _",
    "@xcite , are found in the range of @xmath54 to @xmath55  ev .    due to the spin - orbit interaction",
    ", we observe a spin - orbit ( so ) splitting energy of the valence band top ( @xmath56 ) , at the @xmath57-point , which for the cubic phase is @xmath58  mev .",
    "there are no experimental data for @xmath59 in zro@xmath0 reported so far .    for the tetragonal phase ,",
    "the energy transitions at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are very near .",
    "an indirect gap of @xmath53 ( @xmath63 )  ev , and a direct one of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 )  ev , were obtained from non - relativistic ( full - relativistic ) calculations .",
    "a value of @xmath66  mev has been observed for the spin - orbit splitting energy of the valence band top , at @xmath57 , for t - zro@xmath0 .",
    "the band gap energy values , obtained through the full - relativistic calculations , are well compared with those obtained by krlik _",
    "the experimental values for t - zro@xmath0 lie in the range of @xmath67 to @xmath68  ev , according to the results reported by french _",
    "_ @xcite .    for the monoclinic phase , we have obtained an indirect gap of @xmath69  ev ( @xmath70 )  ev in a non - relativistic ( full - relativistic ) calculation , and a direct band gap of @xmath71  ev ( @xmath72 )  ev , so much close to the value of the indirect one , that it is difficult to assure whether the gap is direct or indirect .",
    "as one goes from the cubic to tetragonal , and then to the monoclinic structural phase , the symmetry lowering is responsible for the removal of the degeneracy , hence to the appearance of so many energy bands in the monoclinic case .",
    "figure 1 shows the non - relativistic results obtained for the band structure , along high symmetry directions of the bz , and the total density of states ( tdos ) for the three phases of zro@xmath0 .",
    "the _ main _",
    "character of the peaks in the tdos is also emphasized .",
    "the results for band structures , as obtained from the full - relativistic calculations are presented in fig .",
    "2 . in the upper valence",
    "part of the band structure , the o(2p)-related states are predominant , while in its lower part , the o(2s)- derived states are the most relevant , independently of inclusion of the relativistic corrections , for all three phases .",
    "the zr(4p ) states appear rather deep in the valence band ( -26 ev ) and , due to the spin - orbit coupling are split into a group at -26 and a group at -28 ev , corresponding to j=3/2 and j=1/2 manifolds , respectively .",
    "the valence- and conduction - band effective masses for the cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic phases of zro@xmath0 , at relevant symmetry points of the bz , are presented in table ii for several directions .",
    "full- and non - relativistic ( see the values in parenthesis ) results are shown . in order to remain within the region of validity of the parabolic approximation , the effective masses were calculated by considering the energy curves within a small region of radius @xmath73 centered on the extremum of interest .",
    "as we observe , in both the valence and conduction bands , the carrier effective masses are very anisotropic , i.e. , show a relevant dependence on the @xmath74 direction .",
    "moreover , remarkable differences arise when the relativistic effects are taken into account . in particular , for the cubic phase , relativistic effects are seen to be most important in the @xmath75 direction , for holes and electrons , while these effects are more relevant in the @xmath76 direction , for the case of holes , for the tetragonal phase , and in the @xmath77 direction , for electrons and holes , for the monoclinic phase .",
    "so far , there are no reported experimental data in the literature of carrier effective masses in zro@xmath0 .",
    "this represents the first report of effective mass values , as calculated for all phases of zro@xmath0 , of fundamental importance to the modelling of advanced devices based on this oxide .",
    "the electronic contributions to the real ( @xmath78 ) and imaginary ( @xmath79 ) parts of the complex dielectric function , @xmath80 , can be obtained from the band structure directly through the wien2k code @xcite , @xmath81 from @xmath82 , and vice - versa , using the kramers - kronig relations @xcite .",
    "once is known the imaginary part @xmath79 , from the flapw electronic structure calculations , the real part @xmath78 is then given by @xcite    @xmath83    other optical properties , such as the reflectivity r(@xmath84 ) and the complex refraction index n(@xmath84 ) can also be obtained .",
    "we took into account that energy gaps are under evaluated by dft @xcite , by adopting the following procedure : the dielectric function , and all the related optical properties , were obtained by performing an upward rigid shift , to the experimental energy value of the band gap @xcite , of all the conduction band states . in general , for metals and conductor materials , the optical properties calculations demand a great number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , therefore , a study of convergence , that considers the number of k - points used , is necessary . in the case of the insulating oxide zro@xmath0",
    "studied here , we have verified that no more than about @xmath85 symmetrized k - points were sufficient .",
    "figure 3 shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function ( electronic contribution ) , for the three phases of zro@xmath0 , considering energies till 30 ev . for the cubic phase ,",
    "all the diagonal components of @xmath86 are identical ( @xmath87 ) , whereas the off - diagonal components are zero .",
    "the energy spectrum was _ adjusted _ by shifting it upwards , to the band gap experimental value for the monoclinic phase , @xmath88 ev @xcite . for tetragonal and monoclinic phases ,",
    "the adjustment was taken by considering the same experimental value as for the monoclinic phase , once this later is the observed phase at ambient temperature .",
    "the function @xmath86 , for t - zro@xmath0 , has all off - diagonal components equal to zero , but symmetry assures that @xmath89 . for the monoclinic phase , the components that are different from zero are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .    in order to avoid confusion , results for both full - relativistic ( frel ) and non - relativistic ( nrel ) calculations are shown in fig.3 only for the cubic phase .",
    "relative changes in the values of the dielectric function , due to relativistic effects amount to @xmath94 , at maximum , for all cases . for the tetragonal and monoclinic phases ,",
    "the presented results derive from full - relativistic calculations .",

    "the enhancement , observed in the measured values of the zro@xmath0 dielectric constant , is due to the role played by the optical phonons .",
