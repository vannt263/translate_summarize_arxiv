    "the proportionality factor should have units of energy@xmath89 and arises from the local density of superconductor states at the interface .",
    "we fit this disorder - dependent proportionality factor to recover the correct limiting behavior , @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "for completeness , we include a formal description of the self - energy model - i.e. ,  integrating out \" the superconductor degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a completely generic approach and is manifestly exact for any quadratic model . given a hamiltonian matrix @xmath92 describing the entire hybrid system , we can separate the hilbert space into blocks describing spatial degrees of freedom in the wire ( @xmath93 ) and the superconductor ( @xmath94 ) , as in .",
    "we otherwise leave the spatial indices implicit in the matrix structure of the following equations . the full resolvent matrix for this hamiltonian is g ( ) =    - h _ & + ^ & - h _    ^-1 and",
    "since we are interested only in the amplitudes for propagation between points in @xmath93 , we only need the upper left block of the inverted matrix .",

    "however , treating the induced self - energy exactly requires similar computational resources to diagonalizing the full hamiltonian @xmath92 .",
    "one therefore typically relies on self - energies with simple analytic forms ( i.e. , a clean , infinite superconductor ) or introduces some approximations ( i.e. , born approximation to treat disorder in the superconductor ) at this stage .    as an example , invoking the simple , well - justified , and frequently used self - energy model ( ) = - ( ) the green s function for region @xmath93 can be reorganized , and to linear order in @xmath96 we have @xmath97^{-1 } & = \\omega - h_\\mathcal{a } - \\sigma(\\omega ) \\\\ & \\simeq \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta } \\right ) \\omega - h_\\mathcal{a } + \\gamma \\sigma_y \\tau_y \\\\ & = z^{-1 } \\left ( \\omega - z h_{\\mathcal{a } } + \\tilde{\\delta } \\sigma_y \\tau_y \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 renormalizes the  bare \" energy scales associated with @xmath99 , while @xmath100 is the induced pair potential .    in this reduced model , for @xmath101 ,",
    "the condition for opening a topological gap becomes v^z_nw > z^-1 = in other words , because of the downward renormalization of the bare wire energy scale , the bare zeeman energy needs to exceed the coupling , rather than the induced gap , even in the strong coupling limit where @xmath102 .",
    "the superconducting coherence length in the nanowire should be obtained from the renormalized fermi velocity and pair potential as = = which suggests that the coherence length is independent of the spectral gap or the pair potential , and can be made arbitrarily short by increasing @xmath1 .",
    "that a spatially varying pair potential gives rise to similar dos behavior as magnetic disorder is easily demonstrated ( and shown in @xcite ) , following the abrikosov - gorkov pair breaking formalism . writing a generalized disorder potential = u_1 ( ) _ z + u_2 ( ) + u_3 ( ) _ y _ y where the last term has the same nambu structure as the pairing , we note that the difference between magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities arises from the fact that \\{_z , _ y _ y } = 0 , = 0 for arbitrary @xmath103 . obviously @xmath104 = 0 $ ] as well , so the two potentials @xmath105 contribute in an identical fashion to the renormalized green s function in born approximation ."

    "<S> our goal is to treat the composite wire and sc system in a nonperturbative , approximation - free manner to the extent that the wire is noninteracting and the parent superconductor can be treated within the bdg mean - field approximation . because the model is fundamentally quadratic , it seems that it should be amenable to an exact numerical solution </S>",

    "<S> although a zero bias conductance peak may still arise from mzms localized near the wire edges , the system is by no means topologically protected since there are many other mzms localized at random spatial locations along the wire ( in fact , the conductance signature should be similar to that found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these bulk low - energy modes will participate in braiding in an uncontrollable way . </S>",
    "<S> an upside , however , is that this situation can not persist down to arbitrarily small @xmath1 ( again , in a finite wire ) , since we eventually return to the protected regime , where the ts gap is small ( @xmath29 ) but unaffected by sc disorder .    . </S>",
    "<S> as in ( a ) , the markers represent the disorder averaged @xmath10 while the dashed lines designate the minimum @xmath10 over all disorder samples . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to substantially suppressing the topological gap at @xmath17 , there is a large , disorder - induced gapless regime , such that a very large zeeman energy is required to reopen the gap . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    * field - tuned topological phase transition : * the previous section analyzed how disorder and strong proximity coupling conspire to suppress topological superconductivity . in experiments , however , @xmath1 will be fixed , while the topological phase transition is tuned by an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in we show the disorder averaged @xmath10 at @xmath30 across this field - tuned phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines of again highlight the minimum @xmath10 over many disorder realizations . on the non - topological side @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> the gap suppression is rather mild , as in . while the average @xmath10 shows a  rounded \" approach to zero at the transition , the gap in the disorder averaged dos , sensitive to the minimum @xmath10 , can close well before the transition . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is far more substantial on the topological side where , for @xmath32 , the gapless region persists up to @xmath33 . in all cases , however , at sufficiently large @xmath34 the dos gap reopens and any wire edge mzms are energetically isolated . </S>",
    "<S> however , large fields are undesirable as they suppress the parent sc , and also the ts gap is small in the high - field regime going approximately as @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion : * we conclude by summarizing the main message of this work . </S>",
    "<S> strong proximity coupling is experimentally desirable for maximizing the induced pair correlations and spectral gap in the nanowire , however , this also necessarily eliminates the protection , predicted for weak coupling , of the induced superconductivity in the nanowire against sc disorder . </S>",
    "<S> realistically , the parent sc materials in present experiments are quite disordered and the resulting induced disorder in the nanowire can easily be sufficient to close the spectral gap and , in particular , produce an accumulation of low - energy mzms in the wire bulk , consistent with previously studied effective models of disordered semiconductor nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> new to this work is a technique addressing this issue directly , beyond effective models or born approximation , which also characterizes the entire wire spectrum , rather than just the edge ldos . </S>",
    "<S> the expected benefits of strong proximity coupling vanish in the presence of sc disorder , even if the wire itself has zero disorder , suggesting that experiments should aim for the protected limit of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this also suggests the optimality of larger gap ( but still bcs - like ) parent superconductors , both to increase the overall energy scale and to decrease disorder effects through the shorter coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> while our results are obtained for a quasi - one - dimensional model , the general principle extends just as well to synthetic ts in two dimensional sm - sc hybrids , where the experimental status is advancing rapidly @xcite .    </S>",
