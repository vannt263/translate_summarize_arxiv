    "in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , a typical virialized object consists of a luminous galaxy centered in a dark matter halo and surrounded by satellites , some of which may contain no stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we explore three questions about the structure of such halos using four gravitational lenses in which we can accurately measure the structure of the einstein ring image of the quasar host galaxy .    first , we explore the angular structure of the dark matter halos .",
    "the angular structure of luminous early - type galaxies is well - approximated by projected ellipsoidal distributions , or ellipses , albeit with small systematic deviations @xcite .",
    "considerably less is known about the angular structure of dark matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly after their structure is modified by the dissipative cooling and reheating of the baryons by star formation as the galaxy evolves .",
    "this issue is relevant to the halo structures less from an interest in the ellipticity of the halos than from the possibility that strong deviations from an ellipsoidal density distribution may be responsible for the flux ratio anomalies in gravitational lenses ( e.g. , @xcite ) that otherwise provide the strongest evidence for the existence of dark matter substructures in the halos of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that lens potentials with arbitrary angular structure could reproduce the flux anomalies without the substructures , but @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrated for several lenses that the deviations in the lens potentials from an ellipsoidal distribution are too small to remove the flux anomalies .",
    "here we extend our study of the shape of the gravitational fields in galaxy halos to three more gravitational lens systems .",
    "second , we explore whether the center of mass of the luminous galaxy is identical to the center of mass of the halo , since most popular halo models assume that luminous galaxies are centered on their dark matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although it is unlikely that the core of the stellar and dark matter distributions can be offset in a galaxy , potentially there could be some lopsidedness or other effects that would make it invalid to assume that the center of light is the center of mass .",
    "weakening the centering of the halo on the lens galaxy was also one of the factors permitting @xcite to explain flux ratio anomalies with changes in the lens potential .",
    "small numbers of massive , but dark substructures would also create an offset between the centers of mass and light .",
    "finally , we explore the halo structure of a galaxy group .",
    "it is likely that central and satellite galaxies in a group show significantly different mass - to - light ratios on large scales due to the mass differences between halos associated with each galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this could explain , for example , the increasing evidence that early - type galaxies are heterogeneous in their structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most lens galaxies are members of small galaxy groups , where the other galaxies in the group can perturb the lens through their tidal gravities .",
    "if we consider a lens centered on one of the satellite galaxies , then we might plausibly identify the central galaxy if one of the other galaxies in the group has a significantly higher mass - to - light ratio on large scales than the others .",
    "if , on the other hand , the structural differences between central and satellite galaxies are small compared to the intrinsic scatter , then no such identification can be made .",
    "we can explore these possibilities using lens galaxies in small groups .",
    "we examine these three issues using four gravitational lenses with well - defined einstein ring images of the quasar host galaxy : sdss  j0924 + 0219 @xcite , he  0435@xmath21223 @xcite , b  1938 + 666 @xcite and pg  1115 + 080 @xcite .",

    "we discuss the third question for the galaxy group surrounding pg  1115 + 080 in  [ sec : result2 ] .",

    "the image is fitted by a model consisting of the lens galaxy , the quasar images , and a lensed host galaxy . the lens galaxy and quasar images",
    "are then subtracted , and we measure the radius @xmath10 of the einstein ring as a function of position angle around the lens galaxy .",

    "the best - fit parameters and the @xmath134-test results for each model and each lens galaxy are presented in table  [ tab : best ] .",
    "each lens is modeled with the environmental components ( shear , nearby galaxies ) described in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we focus on higher order ( @xmath140 ) angular structure in  [ sec : ang ] and on the match between the center of mass and the center of light in  [ sec : cen ] .",
    "our basic result is that sdss  j0924 + 0219 , he  0435@xmath21223 and b  1938 + 666 appear to be ellipsoids , as we had previously found for pg  1115 + 080 @xcite . in all four cases ,",
    "the improvement in the goodness of the fit from adding the @xmath187 terms to the potential is statistically insignificant .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in table  [ tab : best ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : all ] illustrates the differences in the critical lines and isodensity contours for the ellipsoidal and nonellipsoidal models of the three lenses .",
    "figure  [ fig : coef ] displays the values of the center of mass offsets and the higher order deviations @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) from an ellipsoid . in table  [ tab : best ] , we quantify the difference of the two best - fit ellipsoidal and nonellipsoidal models by providing the @xmath134-test probability for the nonellipsoidal model being consistent with the ellipsoidal model . in none of the lenses do the additional structural parameters of the nonellipsoidal model improve the fits .",
    "although we generally ignore the constraints on the flux ratios in this paper , we note that the best - fit ellipsoidal models reproduce the observed flux ratios except for the images with flux anomalies that are probably due to substructure or stellar microlensing .",
    "for example , the flux anomaly a@xmath190/a@xmath191 of pg  1115 + 080 turns out to be due to the stellar microlensing @xcite .",
    "the image d of sdss  j0924 + 0219 and the images a and c of he  0435@xmath21223 also show deviations of predicted compared to observed fluxes while the global lens models in both cases provide a reasonable fit to the image positions and the flux ratios of the rest of the images .",
    "since the magnification is more sensitive to the higher order structure in the potential , the best - fit nonellipsoidal models using only astrometric constraints fit the observed flux ratios of the anomalous images poorly .",
    "however , even if we impose the flux ratio constraints including the anomalies , the best - fit parameters change little from those for the ellipsoidal model , and it is simply impossible to fit the flux ratios while simultaneously obtaining a good fit to each einstein ring .",
    "we consider models based only on the astrometric constraints in the rest of this paper .",
    "ellipsoidal models fit the observed image positions and the einstein ring of sdss  j0924 + 0219 well with @xmath192 .",
    "while a slightly better fit with @xmath193 is found using the nonellipsoidal model , the @xmath134-test probability that the additional variables were unnecessary is 93.4% , so the astrometric constraints from the einstein ring strongly favor the ellipsoidal model for the lens galaxy of sdss  j0924 + 0219 over nonellipsoidal models .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we have no difficulty finding a model that simultaneously fits the quasar images and the einstein ring .",
    "the difference probably arises because @xcite compared model parameters from two separate fits to each constraint rather than fitting both constraints simultaneously .",
    "he  0435@xmath21223 is also well fitted by the ellipsoidal model with @xmath194 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : all ] ) .",
    "in fact , we overfit the data and/or the uncertainties in the einstein ring curve are overestimated by 76% .",
    "the ellipsoidal model with a nearby sis and an external shear provides a fit consistent with the recent measurements of the image time delays @xcite , and the parameters of the best - fit nonellipsoidal model are consistent with those of the ellipsoidal model .",
    "in addition to the @xmath134-test indicating that the additional variables of this nonellipsoidal model are unnecessary , the best - fit nonellipsoidal model requires a high external shear of @xmath195 compared to 0.035 for the ellipsoidal model . considering that we have taken out the contribution from the nearby galaxy g22 , it is unphysical to have external perturbations of @xmath1967% .",
    "the high amplitude of the external shear in the nonellipsoidal model compensates for the higher order deviations of the lens potential from an ellipsoid .",
    "the lens system b  1938 + 666 exhibits doubly lensed ( _ open squares _ ) and quadruply ( _ open triangles _ ) lensed radio images whose sources are two radio lobes rather than a central core @xcite .",
    "note that the double radio images are offset from the einstein ring .",
    "for this lens , we therefore include two additional source positions for the radio images offset from the center of the host galaxy producing the einstein ring .",
    "the nearly circular einstein ring rules out any significant higher order deviations in nonellipsoidal models , and the best - fit nonellipsoidal model is consistent with the ellipsoidal model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coef ] ) .      in the previous subsection we constrained the position of the lens galaxy to agree with the position of the luminous galaxy seen in the @xmath8 images .",
    "this is the standard assumption of almost all lens models . in principle",
    ", the center of mass could differ from the center of light if the halo were genuinely offset from the stars , if the halo were significantly lopsided , or if there were any sufficiently massive dark substructures inside the einstein ring . to test these possibilities",
    ", we drop the constraints on the lens position and repeat the optimization of the ellipsoidal models to estimate the offset @xmath183 of the center of mass from the lens galaxy .",
    "physically it seems unlikely that the galaxy light can be significantly offset from the dark matter halo on galaxy scales , and this is borne out by these results .",
    "we find that the center of mass can be offset from the center of light by only @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 for sdss  j0924 + 0219 , he  0435@xmath21223 , b  1938 + 666 , and pg  1115 + 080 , respectively .",
    "these correspond to physical offsets of @xmath201 , 17.4@xmath202 , 61.9@xmath203 , and 4.6@xmath204  pc .",
    "the nonellipsoidal models only increase the uncertainties in the offsets by roughly a factor of 1.5 and provide upper limits consistent with the values of the offsets . for a typical dark matter fraction inside the einstein ring of @xmath205 @xcite ,",
    "the offset in the center of mass of the dark matter halo is related to the offset in the center of mass by @xmath206 , so the limits on the offset of the dark matter halo are somewhat weaker .",
    "note that this co - location of the stars and the halo may not hold in clusters .",
    "for example , models of the cluster lens sdss  j1004 + 4112 require an offset of @xmath207 between the cd galaxy and the center of the cluster potential @xcite , and there is some evidence that cd galaxies are not at rest with respect to the rest frame defined by the other cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the offsets also test the lopsidedness of dark matter halos and the existence of massive dark substructures .",
    "the luminous galaxies show no evidence for lopsidedness , because they are well modeled by ellipsoidal de vaucouleur profiles .",
    "since dark matter halos are also supported by random particle motions , they should also have difficulty supporting a lopsided density structure , and this is borne out by the tight limits on @xmath208 .",
    "finally , the lack of an offset also sets a limit on the existence of massive dark substructures .",
    "given a typical subhalo mass function , most massive substructures dominate the total mass contained in substructure @xcite .",
    "if we add a single object whose mass is fraction @xmath209 of the mass inside the einstein ring at radius @xmath210 for the lens galaxy , it would shift the center of mass by @xmath211 .",
    "thus , we have a limit that @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the rms distance of the satellites inside the einstein ring from the lens center .",
    "crudely , @xmath214 , the einstein radius , so @xmath215 .",
    "adding additional satellites only weakly affects the limits , increasing the limit on @xmath209 by @xmath216 for @xmath7 equal mass satellites .",
    "this strong sensitivity to massive substructures is presumably one of the reasons that it is almost impossible to model lenses like mg  j0414 + 0534 with visible satellites using only a central potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the halo model that describes the relation of galaxies and dark matter , a luminous central galaxy is located at the center of dark matter halo and the satellite galaxies are distributed around the central galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in  [ sec : cen ] , we found that visible lens galaxies must be centered on their halos , and that they generally lack massive substructures .",
    "if , however , we consider a lens consisting of a galaxy in a group , like pg  1115 + 080 , then we can explore the relationship between central and satellite galaxies .",
    "this is potentially important because the time delay measurements for pg  1115 + 080 @xcite require a main lens galaxy with almost no dark matter at the concordance value of the hubble constant @xmath217 @xcite , in marked contrast to the typical lens galaxies , which seem to have a significant dark halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this case suggests that the structures of early - type galaxies are heterogeneous .",
    "one possible interpretation of this heterogeneity is that the primary lens of pg  1115 + 080 is a satellite lens galaxy of the group that has been stripped of most of its dark matter . in the context of the halo model",
    ", this implies that one of the other visible galaxies around pg  1115 + 080 must be the central galaxy of the group , and it should show a significantly higher mass - to - light ratio than the other galaxies , all of which are satellites . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to interpret pg  1115 + 080 within this theoretical picture .",
    "figure  [ fig : env ] shows the environment of pg  1115 + 080 .",
    "earlier models with an independent external shear or an sis external perturber consistently indicate that the lens has a @xmath19610% shear perturbation associated with its parent group , with weak evidence that the group halo should be located near the luminosity weighted position of the nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the galaxies g1 , g2 and g3 are comparable in luminosity to the main lens galaxy , and the less luminous galaxy g14 is the closest .",

    "the logarithmic scatter of the correlation is @xmath270 for the best - fit model , and will give @xmath271 fractional differences .",

    "in this paper we explored the structure of halos using four gravitational lenses with well - defined einstein ring images of the quasar host galaxies . adopting a scale - free potential with arbitrary angular structure , we considered both ellipsoidal and nonellipsoidal gravitational potentials , searching for any deviation from an ellipsoidal potential . based on the astrometric constraints",

    "anomalous flux ratios can not be eliminated by changing the central potential .",
    "the angular structures of all four lens systems are consistent with ellipsoidal models .",
    "we also investigated the offset of the center of mass of the lenses from the measured center of light by dropping the constraints that the lens is centered on the visible galaxy .",
    "we find that the offsets are required to be @xmath278  pc .",
    "this roughly implies that the dark matter halos can be offset by at most @xmath279  pc , where @xmath205 is a typical fraction of dark matter inside the einstein ring",
    ". this may be markedly different from clusters in which the cd galaxy can be significantly offset from the center of the cluster potential .",
    "dark substructures of mass fraction @xmath209 could also shift the center of mass if there are few of them , and this allows us to set a limit of @xmath6 for @xmath7 equal mass substructures inside the einstein ring .",
    "this limit is not tight enough to represent a conflict with either theoretical @xcite or observational @xcite estimates of the substructure fraction .    finally , we explored the environment of pg  1115 + 080 to study the halo structure of its parent group under the assumption that the individual dark matter halos are centered on the nearby luminous galaxies .",
    "we focused on the four galaxies g1 , g2 , g3 , and g14 producing the largest perturbations , since the other nearby galaxies produce negligible higher - order perturbations and have effects degenerate with an independent external shear . placing the mass solely on these galaxies",
    "can fit the data , but we find only weak evidence for any systematic correlation between the mass and the luminosity .",
    "models assuming the galaxies have extended halos on the scale of their separations are slightly better than those where they do not , but the scatter in the correlation between the einstein radius and @xmath218-band luminosity must be @xmath271 .",
    "this is comparable to that implied by faber - jackson relation observed for nearby galaxies or for lens galaxies .",
    "we also found no evidence for a marked difference between one of the galaxies ( the `` group halo central galaxy '' ) and the others ( satellite galaxies ) .",
    "the rapid convergence of the perturbations from nearby galaxies to a single external shear probably means that lenses like pg  1115 + 080 provide an insufficient number of constraints to test the hypothesis of the halo model in detail .",
