    "the new generation of high - resolution ir spectrographs showed its tremendous potential to study both distant and obscured stellar populations . particularly in the case of heavily reddened regions such as the galactic bulge and center ,",
    "ir spectroscopy offers the best , and sometimes a unique , approach to measuring the composition of the old stellar populations .    in the last few years , we have started a high - resolution spectroscopic survey of the galactic bulge in the near - ir by using nirspec , a high - throughput ir echelle spectrograph at the keck observatory @xcite .",
    "h - band ( @xmath9 m ) spectra of bright giants in the bulge globular clusters and field population are ideal for detailed abundance analysis of fe , c , o and other @xmath1-elements , using the approach of synthesizing the entire spectrum .",
    "the abundance distributions in the cluster and field populations are crucial in constraining the history of bulge formation and chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "we have used this method to derive abundances for ten globular clusters in the inner and outer bulge regions : the resulting abundances for ngc6553 and liller  1 are given in @xcite , for terzan  4 and terzan  5 in @xcite , for ngc  6342 and ngc  6528 in @xcite , for ngc  6539 and uks  1 in @xcite , and for ngc  6440 and ngc  6441 in @xcite .",
    "we also measured detailed abundances of bulge m giants in the baade s window @xcite and in three inner fields at @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we found @xmath1-enhancement at a level of a factor between 2 and 3 over the whole range of metallicity spanned by the bulge clusters in our survey , from [ fe / h]@xmath13 ( cf .",
    "terzan  4 ) up to [ fe / h]@xmath14 ( cf .",
    "terzan  5 ) .    here",
    "we present the high resolution ir spectra and abundance analysis of bright giants in ngc  6569 and ngc  6624 , two globular clusters of the outer bulge , located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively @xcite .",
    "ngc  6569 is a rather compact cluster located in the sagittarius region .",
    "@xcite from integrated photometry obtained [ fe / h]@xmath17 and e(b - v)@xmath18 , while from integrated ddo photometry , @xcite estimated [ fe / h]@xmath19 and e(b - v)@xmath20 . the optical photometric studies by @xcite and @xcite suggested a metallicity consistent with that of 47  tuc .",
    "the only ir photometric study is that by @xcite who found [ fe / h]@xmath21 and e(b - v)@xmath22 .",
    "no high spectral resolution measurements of this cluster exist so far .    in the last few years",
    ", ngc  6624 has been subject of several studies aimed at investigating its population of `` exotic '' objects , such as x - ray binaries ( see * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) and millisecond pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "deep optical hst photometry , down to the main sequence turnoff region , have been presented by @xcite finding the cluster to be coeval to 47  tuc .",
    "its similarity to 47  tuc is also based on the metallicity , in fact @xcite found [ fe / h]@xmath23 based on observations of the ca  ii ir triplet lines in giant stars of ngc  6624 .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a detailed analysis of the cluster red giant branch properties based on high resolution ir photometry , finding e(b - v)=0.28 , ( m - m)@xmath24=14.63 and a metallicity like 47  tuc .",
    "however , also in the case of ngc  6624 , no high resolution spectroscopic measurements have been published so far .    a description of the observations and abundance analysis follows in   2 , while in   3 and   4 we present and discusses our results .",

    "the near - ir spectra of cool stars are characterized by many cn , oh and co molecular lines . at the nirspec resolution",
    "@xmath30 several single roto - vibrational oh lines and co bandheads can be measured to derive accurate oxygen and carbon abundances .",
    "most of the cn molecular lines are , instead , faint and blended with the stronger co , oh and atomic lines , preventing any reliable abundance estimates of nitrogen .",
    "other metal abundances can be derived from the atomic lines of fe  i , mg  i , si  i , ti  i , ca  i and al  i.    abundance analysis is performed combining full spectro - synthesis techniques with equivalent width measurements of representative lines . using an updated version @xcite of the code described in @xcite we compute suitable synthetic spectra of giant stars .",
    "the main features of the code and the overall spectral synthesis procedure have been widely discussed and tested in our previous papers and they will not be repeated here . here",
    "we only stress that the code use the lte approximation and is based on the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of @xcite at temperatures @xmath31  k and the atlas9 models for temperatures above 4000  k. the reference solar abundances are from @xcite .",
    "a grid of model spectra is produced by varying the stellar parameters around the photometric values and the abundances and abundance patterns over a large range .",
    "stellar temperatures are estimated from the ( j - k)@xmath24 colours ( see tables  [ photparam ] ) and from molecular lines .",
    "gravity is derived from the theoretical evolutionary tracks according to the location of the stars on the red giant branch .",
    "an average value @xmath32=2.0  km  s@xmath33 has been adopted for the microturbolence velocity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "tighter constrains on stellar parameters are obtained by the simultaneous spectral fitting of several co and oh molecular bands , which are very sensitive to variations of temperature , gravity and microturbolence . as a figure of merit we adopt the difference between the model and the observed spectrum ( hereafter @xmath34 ) . in order to quantify systematic discrepancies",
    "@xmath34 is more powerful than the classical @xmath35 test , which is instead equally sensitive to random and systematic scatters .",
    "equivalent widths of selected lines ( see table  [ ewpar ] ) are computed by gaussian fitting the line profiles with a @xmath820% overall uncertainty .",
    "the model that best reproduces the overall observed spectrum is the same model that best reproduces the equivalent widths of the selected lines and is chosen as the best - fit model .",
    "solutions with @xmath36  k ,",
    "@xmath37  dex and @xmath38 and corresponding @xmath00.2  dex abundance variations from the best - fitting one as well as solutions with @xmath00.1  dex and @xmath00.2  dex abundance variations , are typically significant at @xmath39 level only , using the figure of merit mentioned above ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if the stellar parameters are varied simultaneously , appreciable variations in the spectrum can be measured for smaller ( by a factor of 2 - 3 ) variations of the single quantities , depending on the range of temperature and metallicity of the observed stars .",
    "the adopted variation for the stellar parameters are somewhat conservative and have been empirically estimated comparing observed spectra with synthetic ones covering a fine grid of stellar parameters . at the observed spectral resolution ( r=25,000 ) and",
    "signal - to - noise ( 30 - 50 ) , single variation of 100 - 200  k in @xmath40 or 0.5  dex in log  g or 0.5  km  s@xmath33 in @xmath32 produce variations in the spectrum which can be reliably measured / disentangled from the observational errors .",
    "typically , for the observed red giant branch stars in metal - rich globular clusters these variations can introduce a maximum systematic uncertainty in the derived abundances between 0.1 and 0.2  dex .",
    "it must be noted , however , that since the stellar features under consideration show a similar trend with variation in the stellar parameters , although with different sensitivity , _ relative _ abundances are less dependent on the stellar parameter assumptions ( i.e. on the systematic errors ) and their values are well constrained down to @xmath410.1  dex .
