    "the long - time dynamics of biological evolution have recently attracted considerable interest among statistical physicists @xcite , who find in this field new and challenging interacting nonequilibrium systems .",
    "an example is the bak - sneppen model @xcite , in which interacting species are the basic units , and less  fit \" species change by  mutations \" that trigger avalanches that may lead to a self - organized critical state .",
    "however , in reality both mutations and natural selection act on _ individual organisms _ , and it is desirable to develop and study models in which this is the case .",
    "one such model was recently introduced by hall , christensen , and coworkers @xcite . to enable very long monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the evolutionary behavior",
    ", we have developed a simplified version of this model , for which we here present preliminary results .",
    "the model consists of a population of individuals with a haploid genome of @xmath1 binary genes @xcite , so that the total number of potential genomes is @xmath2 .",
    "the short genomes we have been able to study numerically ( here , @xmath3 ) should be seen as coarse - grained representations of the full genome .",
    "we thus consider each different bit string as a separate  species \" in the rather loose sense that this term is used about haploid organisms . in our simplified model",
    "the population evolves asexually in discrete , nonoverlapping generations , and the population of species @xmath4 in generation @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "the total population is @xmath7 . in each generation , the probability that an individual of species @xmath4 has @xmath8 offspring before it dies is @xmath9 , while it dies without offspring with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the reproduction probability @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 } \\;. \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] the verhulst factor @xmath13 @xcite , which prevents @xmath14 from diverging , represents an environmental `` carrying capacity '' due to limited shared resources . the time - independent interaction matrix @xmath15 expresses pair interactions between different species such that the element @xmath16 gives the effect of the population density of species @xmath17 on species @xmath4",
    ". elements @xmath16 and @xmath18 both positive represent symbiosis or mutualism , @xmath16 and @xmath18 both negative represent competition , while @xmath16 and @xmath18 of opposite signs represent predator - prey relationships . to concentrate on the effects of interspecies interactions , we follow @xcite in taking @xmath19 . as in @xcite , the offdiagonal elements of @xmath16 are randomly and uniformly distributed on @xmath20 $ ] . in each generation , the genomes of the individual offspring organisms undergo mutation with probability @xmath21 per gene and individual .",
    "mc simulations were performed with the following parameters : mutation rate @xmath22 per individual , carrying capacity @xmath23 , fecundity @xmath24 , and genome length @xmath3 . for a system with @xmath25 or only a single species and @xmath26 ,",
    "the steady - state total population is found by linear stability analysis @xcite to be @xmath27 . in this regime both",
    "the number of populated species and the total population @xmath28 are smaller than the number of possible species , @xmath29 .",
    "this appears biologically reasonable in view of the enormous number of different possible genomes in nature .",
    "an important quantity is the diversity of the population , which is defined as the number of species with significant populations .",
    "operationally we define it as @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the information - theoretical entropy ( known in ecology as the shannon - weaver index @xcite ) , @xmath32 \\ln \\left [ { n_i(t)}/{n_{\\rm tot}(t ) } \\right ] $ ] .",
    "results for a run of @xmath33 generations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](*a * ) are shown time series of @xmath34 and @xmath28 .",
    "we see relatively quiet periods ( quasi - steady states , qss ) punctuated by periods of high activity . during the active periods",
    "the diversity fluctuates wildly , while the total population falls below its typical qss value . a corresponding picture of the species index ( the decimal representation of the binary genome ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](*b * ) , with grayscale indicating @xmath6 .",
    "comparison of the two parts of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] show that the qss correspond to periods during which the population is dominated by a relatively small number of species , while the active periods correspond to transitions during which the system is  searching for \" a new qss .    closer inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] suggests that there are shorter qss within some of the periods of high activity .",
    "this led us to consider the power - spectral densities ( psd ) of the diversity and total population , measured in very long simulations of @xmath35 generations .",
    "the psd of the diversity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and indicates that the model exhibits flicker noise with a spectrum near @xmath0 @xcite over at least four to five decades in frequency .",
    "it has been much discussed in evolutionary biology whether species evolve gradually or in a succession of qss , punctuated by periods of rapid change . the latter mode has been termed  punctuated equilibria \" by gould and eldredge @xcite .",
    "there is also some indication that flicker noise is found in the fossil record of extinctions , but due to the sparseness of the fossil evidence this is a contested issue @xcite .",
    "the model discussed here can at best be applied to the evolution of asexual , haploid organisms such as bacteria , and one should also note that no specific , biologically relevant information has been included in the interaction matrix . nevertheless , we find it encouraging that such a simple model of macroevolution with individual - based births , deaths , and mutations can produce punctuated equilibria and flicker noise reminiscent of current theories of biological macroevolution .",
