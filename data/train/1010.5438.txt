    "recently , banados , silk and west ( bsw ) showed that two test particles can collide with arbitrarily high energy in the center of mass frame near an extremal kerr black hole , even though these particles were at rest at infinity in the infinite past  @xcite .",
    "we call this mechanism the bsw mechanism or the bsw process , and several aspects of this mechanism have been reported in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if this mechanism was really workable , it might be possible to probe planck - scale physics by observing the neighborhood of an extreme or almost extreme kerr black hole . however , it is not yet clear whether particles can really be accelerated with sufficient efficiency to produce collisions with planckian energies . to answer this question ,",
    "it is necessary to consider , among other things , the effect of particle size , the effect of gravitational radiation on the trajectories of the particles , and the effect of the gravity generated by the particles themselves at the event horizon . in this paper , we focus on the third effect .",
    "the bsw mechanism is also interesting from a purely relativistic point of view . the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to imply that the energy of the colliding particles in the center of mass frame can be as large as the mass of the kerr black hole in the background spacetime , and hence the gravity generated by the particles is so strong that another black hole forms .",
    "such intense gravity can not be described using a linear perturbation approximation of the kerr spacetime .",
    "thus , even if the energy of the particles is initially small enough that the gravity due to these particles is well described by the linear perturbation approximation , the gravity generated by the energy of these particles might finally become too strong to invoke linear perturbation analysis .",
    "if this inference is true , the kerr black hole is unstable against minor perturbations induced by dropping small particles into the black hole under finely tuned initial conditions .",
    "this conclusion is paradoxical , because it is well known that a kerr black hole is stable against small perturbations .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate how large the energy of colliding particles in the center of mass frame can be , by taking into account the gravity due to the particles .",
    "however , it is difficult to treat the effects of gravity generated by particles around a kerr black hole .",
    "one of the reasons for this difficulty is the fact that kerr spacetime is not very symmetric .",
    "hence , in the present paper , we consider charged particles or charged spherical shells around a spherically symmetric charged black hole known as a reissner - nordstrm black hole , and then show that a process similar to the bsw process is also possible in this system .",
    "next , in order to draw some implications concerning the effects of the gravity generated by colliding objects in this process , we study a collision of spherical dust shells whose gravity is exactly treatable by the israel formalism  @xcite .",

    ", there is no root of @xmath18 , and hence this case is naked singular . in this section , we assume @xmath25 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on two particles whose orbits are confined to the equatorial plane @xmath26 . by integrating the geodesic equations and using the normalization condition of the 4-velocity @xmath27 ( @xmath9 ) , we have @xmath28 } , \\label{geor } \\\\ u_{(i)}^\\phi & = & -\\frac{1}{r^2 } \\left [ ( a{\\cal",

    "( [ cm ] ) , we obtain the square of the cm energy at the collision event as @xmath36 in the extreme case @xmath37 , the cm energy at the degenerate horizon @xmath38 is given in the simple form @xmath39 we see from the above equation that if either @xmath40 or @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 and the other is not , the cm energy at the collision event does not have an upper limit .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "we denote the world line of the 1st particle by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is its proper time .",
    "then , in the extreme case @xmath37 , the square of ( [ geor ] ) gives @xmath45 where we have taken @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we can see from this equation that if this particle is falling toward the black hole , its asymptote is the degenerate horizon @xmath48 . since the only possible causal line on the future horizon is outward null , this particle asymptotically becomes outward null , even though it is falling toward the black hole from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "however , we can show that this is not true .",
    "the detailed discussions are given in @xcite . ] .",
    "hence , the closer the relative velocity between this 1st particle and a 2nd particle with @xmath49 approaches to the speed of light , the closer the collision event approaches the bh horizon . as a result , the collision of these particles can lead to an indefinitely large cm energy near the horizon . here , note that the 1st particle can not reach the horizon within a finite time span , and hence the cm energy never diverges .",
    "since the large cm energy of the particles produces strong gravity , we must take this into account when evaluating how large the cm energy can become in the bsw mechanism .",
    "however , it is difficult to treat the effects of gravity due to the particles , partly because kerr spacetime is not very symmetric .",
    "however , a mechanism similar to the bsw mechanism has been reported for reissner - nordstrm spacetime  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can see the effects of the gravity generated by the colliding objects , since reissner - nordstrm spacetime is more symmetric than kerr spacetime .",

    "we consider another particle with an identical inertial mass @xmath7 to the charged particle but with a vanishing charge , which is also radially falling toward the black hole .",

    "we can easily see that , by this assumption , the absolute value of the velocity of the neutral particle is larger than that of the charged particle at the same radial coordinate . hence , the charged particle corresponds to the 1st particle , whereas the neutral particle corresponds to the 2nd particle in eq .",

    "this is similar to the bsw mechanism .",
    "it is still difficult to treat the gravity of particles in reissner - nordstrm spacetime . here",
    ", it is worthwhile to note that the world line of a radially moving test particle is equivalent to the trajectory of an infinitesimally thin spherical test shell by virtue of the symmetry of reissner - nordstrm spacetime . since the cm energy at the collision event between two shells is the same as that given by eq .",

    "we study the effects of the gravity of a thin spherical charged shell .",
    "in this section , we study the gravity generated by a thin spherical shell with a non - vanishing charge .",
    "an infinitesimally thin shell is equivalent to a singular timelike hypersurface @xmath77 which divides spacetime into two regions @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see fig.[fig : shell1 ] ) .     and @xmath79 . , width=302 ]    the metric tensor @xmath12 should be everywhere continuous , even though @xmath77 is singular .",

    "thus , we may call @xmath115 the specific energy of the shell , and we assume that it is positive .",

    "if the above conditions hold , the effective potential becomes @xmath124 namely , if this charged dust shell is contracting , it asymptotically approaches the outward null hypersurface @xmath125 as long as @xmath126 .",
    "hence , it is likely that a bsw - type mechanism can occur in this system .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this result is correct even if there is no central black hole , i.e. , @xmath127 .",

    ", width=302 ]    in this section , we consider collisions of two spherical dust shells and discuss the cm energy at the collision event .",
    "these two shells divide the spacetime into three regions , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath128 , before the collision ( see fig.[fig : shell2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the inner shell is the same as that considered in the preceding section , whose parameters satisfy conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) .",
    "we also assume that , as in sec .",

    "the total stress - energy tensor of the shells is written in the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the gaussian normal coordinates of the inner and outer shells , respectively .",
    "since the proper masses @xmath109 of these shells are identical to each other , @xmath134 is equal to @xmath135 at the collision event .    here",
    ", we introduce the `` center of mass frame '' at the collision event of the shells .",
    "it is composed of the orthonormal basis @xmath136 which satisfies the following condition @xmath137 the above condition means that the spatial components of the energy flux vanish in this frame .",
    "then , the energy of the colliding shells in this frame , which is also called the cm energy @xmath138 , is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the proper length in the direction of @xmath141 .",
    "as expected , the cm energy of the shells takes the same form as that of the particles .",
    "details of this derivation are given in the appendix .",
    "as shown in the preceding section , the outward null hypersurface @xmath142 is the asymptote of the inner shell .",
    "thus , as in the case of the test shells , the closer the relative velocity between the inner and outer shells approaches to the speed of light , the closer the collision event approaches to the bh horizon in @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath143 . as a result",
    ", the cm energy at the collision event can be indefinitely large , even if the gravity of the colliding shells is taken into account .",
    "however , we should note that if the two shells collide inside the bh horizon in @xmath128 , i.e. , @xmath144 , distant observers like us could not see the collision of these shells .",
    "we should also note that @xmath145 is larger than @xmath146 by virtue of the gravity generated by the outer shell .",
    "thus , the observable cm energy is less than that of the collision at @xmath147 given in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ cm - shell ] ) as @xmath148 where the function @xmath149 is given by @xmath150 we can see from the above result that the cm energy at the collision event between these shells has an upper limit in the observable domain @xmath151 , and this limit is determined by the mass @xmath152 of the `` central black hole '' and the proper mass of the two shells . here",
    ", we should note that in order that the outer shell overtakes the inner shell , @xmath153 should be positive at @xmath154 .",

    "thus , when estimating the size of the observable cm energy , the gravity caused by the colliding objects must not be ignored , even if their initial energy is very small .",
    "in this paper , we studied a collision of two spherical dust shells in order to determine the effects of the gravity generated by the colliding objects in the bsw process .",
    "we have shown that a contracting charged dust shell can asymptotically approach the outward null hypersurface , even if its gravity is taken into account .",
    "if such a shell collides with another contracting shell , the relative velocity between them can be arbitrarily close to the speed of light .",
    "however , we found that the cm energy of two colliding shells has an upper limit in the observable domain , since the event horizon moves outward due to the gravity of the outer shell .",
    "our results suggest that two particles can not collide with an arbitrarily high energy in the center of mass frame in the observable domain , if we take into account the effects of the gravity of the colliding particles .",
    "each dust shell can be regarded as an aggregation of many particles .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study how a large cm energy of the constituent particles of the shells can be achieved by a collision of two shells .",
    "we assume that the mass of the central black hole @xmath152 is much larger than that of a shell @xmath109 , and the constituent particles have an identical rest mass @xmath7 .",

    ". we again note that we are interested in the case of @xmath167 . here",
    ", we introduce a parameter defined by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the planck mass ( @xmath170 g ) . when the shells collide with each other near the horizon @xmath171 , the mean separation between the constituent particles of the shells is given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the solar mass , respectively .",
    "the above equation implies that the mean separation is much larger than the compton wavelength if the mass @xmath152 of the central black hole is equal to @xmath173 , if the mass @xmath7 of a constituent particle is equal to @xmath174 times the planck mass @xmath169 and if the mean cm energy @xmath159 of a constituent particle is equal to or larger than the planck energy , i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "this macroscopic separation implies that the dust approximation can be valid , even if @xmath159 is super - planckian .",
    "further , since the mean separation @xmath176 can be much smaller than @xmath177 cm , the continuum approximation can also be valid .",
    "thus , although the mass of each constituent particle has to be rather large , we may say that the cm energy of the constituent particle can be super - planckian within the dust shell approximation , even if it can not be indefinitely large .",
    "the cm energy of a particle , @xmath159 , is rewritten from eq .",
    "( 43 ) as , @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the proton mass .",
    "thus , within the dust shell approximation , since @xmath157 is much larger than unity , the cm energy will be smaller than the planck energy significantly if the mass of the constituent particles is equal to the proton mass .",
