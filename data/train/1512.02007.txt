    "the difference between this approach and the ( naive ) approach described above is that the total charge @xmath20 is distributed among all spins .",
    "this can be done because u(1 ) symmetry is abelian .",
    "the ` conservation law ' to be fulfilled at each site @xmath92 must be supplemented with the condition @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath88 the choice of @xmath90 is obvious : @xmath94 at each site , and only one degeneracy sector for the virtual indices is needed . but for @xmath95 these conditions can be fulfilled in various ways .",
    "we choose one of them , which distributes @xmath20 over all spins as homogeneously as possible . to this end , @xmath20 is split into small portions , namely 1/2 for spin-1/2 systems .    since @xmath96 for spin-1/2 systems , @xmath97 for a certain number of sites and @xmath98 for the others .",

    "the set @xmath115 is not determined by the symmetry and in principle many possibilities exist .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ principle which dictates a suitable choice .    in practical implementations",
    "one just has to ensure the specific block structure of the matrices in order to maintain u(1 ) symmetry and obtain an mps with the desired spin projection @xmath20 .",
    "there are many ways to do this in practice , and details depend on the software system used to implement the algorithm .",
    "in particular , the obvious sparseness of the matrices must be employed in order to save computational resources . in our implementation",
    "we use the sparse matrix technology available in _ mathematica _ 10 .",

    "after each update step we reconstruct the full structure of each local tensor as a sparse tensor .",
