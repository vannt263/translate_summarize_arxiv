    "of particular interest is the zero - temperature limit @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , where the thermal fluctuations fade away leaving pure quantum fluctuations in the wake .",
    "what remains in ( [ 2.02 ] ) are transitions between the ground state and all excited states that can be reached by the fluctuation operator @xmath32 : @xmath33 the dynamically relevant spectrum observable in ( [ 2.02 ] ) or ( [ 2.03 ] ) may vary considerably between fluctuation operators . among other things ,",
    "the spectrum is sensitive to their symmetry properties .    for the @xmath0 transverse @xmath1 chain ( [ 1.01 ] ) the most important and most widely studied dynamic structure factors",
    "are those for the local spin operators @xmath34 at zero temperature the dynamic spin structure factor @xmath35 is known to couple exclusively to the continuum of particle - hole excitations in the fermion representation , whereas @xmath36 couples to excitations involving an arbitrarily high number of fermion excitations from the ground state @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation operators considered here are constructed from local spin operators on nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites . the dimer fluctuation operator @xmath37 and trimer fluctuation operator @xmath38 are obtained via ( [ 2.01 ] ) from @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "there is no unique way of defining dimer and trimer fluctuation operators .",

    "we offer a twofold argument . for a completely dimerized state ,",
    "where _ nearest - neighbor _ spin correlations alternate between zero and a nonzero value along the chain , the operator @xmath43 plays the role of dimer order parameter .",
    "likewise , for a completely trimerized state , where _ next - nearest neighbor _ spin correlations assume a period - three sequence of values zero , zero , nonzero , the operator @xmath44 plays the role of trimer order parameter .",
    "conversely , if we perturb the uniform @xmath1 hamiltonian ( [ 1.01 ] ) by interactions of the form @xmath45 or @xmath46 the ground state becomes dimerized or trimerized , respectively .",

    "such tools by which the complexity of the dynamically relevant excitation spectrum can be gradually and systematically increased are not only useful for the calculations in the fermion representation as performed here but also for the recently developed techniques of calculating transition rates for the @xmath1 model in the framework of the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
