    "in discussing the operation of gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometric detectors @xcite it is usually stated that the distance between the beam splitter and the mirrors at the end of the arms is changed by the gw @xcite .",
    "when light beams propagate in the arms , the change in the proper length of the two arms results in a phase shift between the light beams that return to the beam splitter .",
    "the phase shift is the physical observable that indicates the presence of a gw .",
    "the above statement is valid if the mirrors are free to move ( along the axis of the arms ) and it is expressed in the laboratory frame of reference , what is referred to as the local lorentz ( ll ) gauge .",
    "it is however much easier to calculate the resulting phase shift in the transverse traceless ( tt ) gauge . in the tt gauge",
    "the gw has a very simple form and the coordinates of free particles ( i.e. of the mirrors ) are not changed in the presence of the gw , even though their separation does change @xcite .",
    "the geometry of space is defined by the infinitesimal interval @xcite    @xmath0    where summation over repeated indices is implied . for weak fields we write the metric tensor as    @xmath1",
    "the flat - space ( minkowski ) metric @xmath2 is chosen to be @xmath3    consider the interferometer in the @xmath4 plane and that a gravitational wave of angular frequency @xmath5 is incident along the @xmath6-axis . in the tt",
    "gauge the potential @xmath7 is given by the real part of the following expression    @xmath8    @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ( real ) amplitudes of the  parallel \" and  cross \" polarization states of the gw . to be specific we will place the origin of the coordinates at the beam splitter and orient",
    "the interferometer arms along the @xmath11- and @xmath12- axes , as shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) . in the next section",
    "we calculate , in the tt gauge , the round trip time for the propagation of light from the beam splitter to the end mirror and back to the origin , in the presence of a gw . we will then obtain the same result by considering , again in the tt gauge , the direct interaction of the gw with the light circulating in the arms .",
    "we will work in the tt gauge so the coordinates of the mirrors are unchanged by the presence of the gravitational wave .",
    "we will calculate the time it takes for light leaving the beam splitter ( the origin ) to reach the end mirror , where it is reflected , and to return to the the beam origin . for light @xmath13 , and since the propagation is in the @xmath4 plane , eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to    @xmath14    for propagation only along the @xmath11-axis , and since we can set @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    the time interval for a round trip is obtained by integrating from the origin to the end of the arm , @xmath17 , and back to the origin . if the light leaves at @xmath18 and returns at @xmath19    @xmath20    where the minus sign before the second integral accounts for the fact that on the return trip @xmath21 . in carrying out the integration we can replace @xmath22 in the exponential by @xmath23 , because any corrections will be of second order in @xmath24 .",
    "we also define the one way travel time in the absence of the gw as @xmath25 .",

    ", the travel time along the @xmath11-axis can be expressed as    @xmath28    for the @xmath12-axis we obtain the same result with @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "thus the difference in travel time between the two arms is    @xmath31 \\frac{l}{c } \\frac{\\rm{sin}(\\omega t)}{\\omega t } e^{i\\omega t}.\\ ] ]     + a difference in the time of arrival of the light from the two arms , implies a phase shift between the two fields . if the angular frequency of the carrier is @xmath32 , the phase shift corresponding to a delay @xmath33 , is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the wavenumber of the carrier .",
    "therefore when the gw is normally incident on the interferometer plane and when the polarization of the gw is along the interferometer axes , the observable phase shift is    @xmath36    where following the convention adopted for eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath37 is given by the real part of eq .",
    "( 10 ) . for a more detailed discussion of this derivation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will now show that the same result can be obtained by considering the direct interaction of the gravitational wave with the light propagating in the interferometer arms . in this section",
    "we find the equations for the electromagnetic field in the presence of the gw , and in the next section we solve the equations for light propagating in the @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 arms .",
    "we find the presence of ( frequency modulation ) sidebands on the carrier displaced by the gw frequency @xmath38 .",
    "this is equivalent to the phase shift found in eq .",
    "( 10 ) .    in flat space maxwell s inhomogeneous equations can be written in the manifest covariant form as    @xmath39    where the field strength tensor is defined as @xmath40 in a curved space and in the absence of sources , eq .",
    "is replaced by @xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 with the field strength tensor still defined by eq . .",
    "the dynamical equation can be derived as the euler - lagrange equation from the action described by the lagrangian density    @xmath43    we will again work in the tt gauge and take the gw to be the same as before . in the tt gauge , in the weak - field approximation @xmath44 , and keeping only terms linear in @xmath45 , eq .",
    "reads    @xmath46    the first term is the same as eq . with @xmath47 , and describes the propagation of the free electromagnetic field .",

    "( 14 ) in @xmath49 field components yields the four equations    @xmath50    since @xmath51 we can drop the terms in @xmath5 and @xmath52 .",
    "we also make use of the condition @xmath15 and choose this leads to the simplified equations    @xmath53    in the next section we will show how to solve these equations when a plane ( light ) wave of angular frequency @xmath54 propagates along the @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 axis .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) fields @xmath55 in the arms consist of the carrier field @xmath56 due to the external source ( the laser beam ) , and the additional field @xmath57 , generated by the source terms in eq . ,",
    "@xmath58    we describe the carrier as a plane wave propagating along the @xmath11-axis and polarized along the @xmath6-axis , and of constant amplitude @xmath59    @xmath60    to the sideband fields @xmath57 , we assign slowly time - dependent amplitudes @xmath61 and a phase factor @xmath62 where @xmath63 , namely ,    @xmath64    we will solve the equations in perturbatively noting that @xmath65 are of order @xmath24 with respect to @xmath66 . thus on the left side of eq .",
    "we must use the full fields @xmath67 but on the right side it suffices to retain only @xmath68 . with the choice of eq . for the carrier field",
    "only the @xmath69 equation is nontrivial ; the first three equations are satisfied automatically with the choices made in eqs .",
    "( 19,20 ) .",
    "writing out the part of order @xmath24 , for the @xmath69 equation in ( 17 ) , gives    @xmath70    the remaining terms of the equation @xmath71    describe the propagation of the free carrier field .",
    "the fields , both carrier and sideband satisfy maxwell s dual equation , namely @xmath72 . for our choice of direction of propagation and polarization",
    ", this condition reduces to    @xmath73    combining eqs . and leads to wave equations for @xmath74    @xmath75    where we have introduced @xmath76 .",
    "we now use eqs . and keep in eqs .",
    "( 24 ) only the first time derivatives @xmath77 of the amplitudes , since @xmath61 vary slowly .",
    "we can also approximate @xmath78 and find the following two eqs for the slowly varying amplitudes    @xmath79    with solutions    @xmath80    where we assumed the initial conditions @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , to the approximation @xmath51 that we are using , the sideband fields are    @xmath82    the amplitudes @xmath61 of the sideband fields are zero at @xmath83 and grow in time as a parametric amplification process .",
    "we will designate them by @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath84 is determined by the losses in the arm cavities , however the carrier amplitude , @xmath59 , remains constant .",
    "for one round trip @xmath85 and the sideband amplitude has the value    @xmath86    we see that after one round trip the amplitude @xmath59 of the carrier acquires a small complex part    @xmath87    where @xmath88    thus the amplitude of the propagating light can be written as    @xmath89    which shows that the phase of the carrier is shifted by exactly the same amount as was calculated in section 2 .",
    "when the carrier propagates in the @xmath12-arm the sign of @xmath24 and thus also of @xmath90 is reversed ; after subtracting the fields returning from the two arms , we find for their relative phase difference @xmath91 , as we had obtained in eq .",
    "+ consider now a gw that depends sinusoidally on time , which we express at @xmath15 by    @xmath92    it is clear that in this case both an upper and lower sideband will be present .",
    "the fields are    @xmath93    where @xmath94 ; to see this change in eq.(30 ) . at @xmath95",
    "the two sideband fields have equal imaginary parts and opposite real parts .",
    "this is the condition that corresponds to phase ( or frequency ) modulation when the sidebands are combined with the carrier    @xmath96   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & e_{0 } e^{-i [ \\omega_{0 } t - \\phi_{a } \\cos \\omega ( t - t ) - k_0 x]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in conclusion a sinusoidal gw interacting with a plane wave carrier ( under the appropriate geometry ) imposes upper and lower sidebands , or equivalently contributes a time - dependent phase shift .",
    "we obtained this result by considering the propagation of the carrier in the space - time of the gw , without referring to the change in the round - trip time of travel to and from the end mirror .",
    "our derivation is based on a * subtle point * , the use of the tt gauge .",
    "we can use the tt gauge only because the end points of the light travel ( the mirrors ) are free .",
    "if the mirrors were fixed we would have to do the calculation in the ll gauge , i.e. in the laboratory frame of reference . in the ll gauge",
    "@xcite the amplitude of the gw is modified from the form given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the relevant part of the metric being      for low frequency gw s the resulting phase shift when the mirrors are fixed is much smaller than for free mirrors , and this is why interferometric gw detectors are constructed with suspended mirrors . for the details of the calculation in the ll gauge see ref .",
    "+ the presence of sidebands has a direct physical interpretation in terms of absorption and stimulated emission of gravitons from / to the gw .",
    "since the gw field is highly classical , [ the occupation number for @xmath98 and @xmath99 hz , is @xmath100 , both processes have the same probability .",
    "absorption leads to the upper sideband , while emission to the lower one .",
    "there is no energy exchange between the optical and gravitational fields , but only a phase shift .",
    "+ in our analysis we have assumed that the carrier is a plane wave propagating toward the positive x - direction , see eqs . ( 19 ) . in practice the carrier",
    "is reflected by a mirror at @xmath101 , thus the electric field should vanish at @xmath101 .",
    "this condition is satisfied by writing the fields in the form      if a mirror is also placed at @xmath103 to reflect the carrier and @xmath104 , a standing wave is established in the region @xmath105 .",
    "this does not modify the conclusions that we have reached .",
    "the case when the carrier is a standing wave is treated by cooperstock and faraoni @xcite and leads to the same results as in eq .",
    "the interaction of an electromagnetic and gravitational field was first discussed by gertsenshtein and pustovoit @xcite in 1963 , and subsequently by others @xcite .",
    "+ we have also shown that a gw will couple to the carrier in a single arm .",
    "the interferometer configuration has been chosen because it is technically advantageous .",
    "the light returning from the two arms is adjusted to interfere destructively at the detection point in the absence of a gw .",
    "thus when the gw induces a phase shift , a signal appears over a null background ( excluding noise ) . by using multiple traversals in the arms one",
    "can increase the effective length , and thus the phase shift , significantly .",
    "the main limitation in effective arm length ( apart from losses in the optics ) is related to the frequency of the gw .",
    "we have seen in eq .",
    "( 10 ) that the phase shift is modulated by the  form factor \" sin@xmath106 , and therefore @xmath107 must be kept small ."
