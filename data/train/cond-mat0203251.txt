    "perovskite type manganites such as r@xmath2a@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( r = rare earth ion and a = alkaline earth ion ) have been extensively investigated due their properties of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite .",
    "the cmr effects originates from a competition between a ferromagnetic metallic ( fmm ) state and an antiferromagnetism insulating ( afmi ) state .",
    "the appearance of the fmm state is explained by the double exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite , whereas the afmi state originates from the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions @xcite , leading in the case of small a - site cations to the charge / orbital ordered ( co / oo ) phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the efforts made for understanding the magnetotransport properties of manganite thin films @xcite have shown that the physical properties are often different from the bulk materials .",
    "the main reason deals with the strains included the substrate - induced strains which modify the lattice parameters of the film and change the properties as shown recently for @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .    in manganite",
    "thin films , the strains are susceptible to modify the mn - o - mn angles and mn - o distances .",
    "consequently , this affects the bandwidth and also the jt distortions , so that de and co / oo  phenomena may be drastically influenced .",
    "based on these considerations , the strain effects should decrease as the thickness increases and it should be possible to establish relationships between the structural distortions and the transport properties , by studying the  properties of the films with various thicknesses .    starting from @xmath7 films where a spectacular cmr  effect was previously evidenced @xcite ,",
    "compared to the bulk @xcite , we have carried out a systematic study of films with different thickness grown in situ using the pulsed laser deposition technique ( pld ) on both ( 100)-srtio@xmath8 and ( 100)-laalo@xmath4 substrates . in this paper ,",
    "a clear correlation between the structural distortions and the transport properties ( insulator - to - metal @xmath9 transition under a magnetic field , co / oo @xmath10 transition ) .",
    "we suggested that for small films thickness the elongation of the mn - o bonds prevails , reinforcing the jt  distortion and consequently the co / oo state , whereas for large thickness the flattering of the mn - o - mn bond angles prevails , increasing the bandwidth favoring the insulator - to - metal transition to the detriment of the co / oo state .",
    "films with different thicknesses were deposited on single crystal substrates of ( 100)-srtio@xmath4 ( sto ) and ( 100)-laalo@xmath4 ( lao ) from a dense targets of nd@xmath11ca@xmath11mno@xmath4 using the pld  technique .",
    "detailed of the process can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the structural study was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a seifert xrd 3000p for the @xmath12 - 2@xmath12 scans and a phillips mrd xpert for the in - plane measurements ( cu k@xmath13 , @xmath14=1.5406 ) .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameters were obtained from the ( 103)@xmath15 reflection ( where c refers to the ideal cubic perovskite cell , @xmath16=3.9 ) . an electron microscope jeol 2010 equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) analysis , was used for the electron diffraction ( ed ) study .",
    "the eds has shown that the cationic composition of the film is homogeneous and remains very close to the nominal one  nd@xmath17ca@xmath18mno@xmath3  within experimental error .",
    "the resistivity ( @xmath19 ) of the films was measured with a ppms quantum design as a function of the magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) and the temperature ( @xmath21 ) using four - probe contacts . the thickness ( @xmath22 ) of the films",
    "is measured using a dektak@xmath23st surface profiler .",
    "besides the classical growth parameters such as the deposition temperature , the oxygen pressure , we found that the energy of the laser was also important in order to obtain a single phase .",
    "the optimum energy value is @xmath24 which corresponds to @xmath25 on the target .",
    "this is evidenced on fig.1 for a 2000  thick film of ncmo on sto .",
    "a low ( @xmath26 ) or a high ( @xmath27 ) laser energy leads to a poor crystallization of the film with appearance of a secondary phase .",
    "the structure of bulk ncmo is orthorhombic ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath29 , @xmath30  and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "some area of the film have been investigated by ed and we found that the films are single phase , [ 010]-oriented , i.e. with the [ 010]-axis perpendicular to the sto substrate plane , and [ 101]-oriented , i.e. with the [ 101]-axis perpendicular to the lao substrate plane in the space group @xmath28 .",
    "this orientation is not surprising and resulting from the lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate as previously reported for pr@xmath11ca@xmath11mno@xmath1 thin films grown on ( 100)-srtio@xmath1 and ( 001)-laalo@xmath1 substrates @xcite .",
    "details of the transmission electron microscopy study are currently undertaken and will be published elsewhere .",
    "fig.2a shows the evolution of the lattice parameters of the ncmo film grown on sto versus thickness .",
    "one observed that the in - plane lattice parameter @xmath32 decreases as the thickness of the film increases while at the same time , the out - of - plane lattice parameter @xmath33 increases .",
    "the lattice parameters of films on lao were also determined ( fig.2b ) but , due to the twins of this substrates , we were not able to obtain the in - plane lattice parameters .",
    "the out - of - plane lattice parameters are almost constant on lao when the thickness is changing , suggesting that the film is quasi - relaxed even for small thickness .      figure 3a shows the resistivity dependence of the temperature for ncmo films on sto . without a magnetic field ,",
    "all films present a semiconducting behavior with an anomaly around 275k , corresponding to the @xmath34 .",
    "a similar effect is observed on the bulk , but at a lower temperature close to 250k @xcite .",
    "in fact , this anomaly in the @xmath35 curves is more clear ( inset of fig .",
    "3a ) , when the resistance is plotted in a logarithmic scale versus the inverse of the temperature . when applying a magnetic field of 7 t , while the thinner film ( @xmath36 ) remains insulating in the whole temperature range of 4 - 300k , the thicker films ( @xmath37 ) show an insulator - to - metal transition ( @xmath9 ) at 100k and 130k for the 1340and 2000  films respectively .",
    "such an effect is typical of the metastability of the co / oo state where a magnetic field ( abbreviated @xmath38 ) can induce a metallic behavior at low temperature .",
    "however , the magnetic field required is much higher in the bulk compound ( close to 20 t for the same temperature ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a dependence of the critical field with the temperature ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the resistivity shows an important decrease on a logarithmic scale at a critical field ( @xmath38 ) indicating the field - induced melting of the co / oo state .",
    "this field - induced insulator - to - metal transition , which accompanies the collapsing of the co / oo state takes place below @xmath34 .",
    "this decrease can be viewed as a cmr of about four orders of magnitude at 75k . a clear hysteresis ( between the lower and the upper critical fields ) is seen at these temperatures as previously reported on several co / oo compounds @xcite but this hysteretic region is more pronounced when the temperature is decreasing ( see @xmath39 at 25k in fig.3b ) .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the large hysteresis region is a feature of a first order transition and has been extensively studied for the composition nd@xmath11sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 in ref .",
    "note also the reentrant nature of the co at 25k due to the fact that a 7 t magnetic field is not enough to completely melt this state .    on lao substrates ,",
    "the @xmath35 curves are practically similar ( fig.4a ) to those on sto except that in this case , even the thinnest film ( 670 ) displays an insulator - to - metal transition when applying a magnetic field of 7 t .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 is higher than in the case of sto  which is consistent with the quasi - relaxed ncmo film found on lao ( for a 1340film , @xmath40 on sto  and @xmath41 on lao ) .",
    "large hystereses indicating the first - order phase transition are also observed ( fig.4b ) and , in the same way , there is an increase of the @xmath34 when the thickness of the film decreases ( inset of fig .",
    "4a ) .",
    "this study shows that the thickness of ncmo films deposited on stoinfluences strongly the transport properties of the material . for the largest thickness ( @xmath42 )",
    ", an insulator - to - metal transition is induced under 7 t  in contrast to the bulk @xcite , although the cell parameters reach values close to those of the bulk ceramics @xcite.moreover , the @xmath9 under 7 t magnetic field decreased as the thickness decreases whereas at the same time , the @xmath34 increases so that for a small thickness ( @xmath43 ) the film remains insulator .",
    "though it was suggested by several authors in bulk samples of the same composition that electronic phase separation can be at the origin of the drop in resistivity @xcite , no evidence of such phase separation was found in the thin films .",
    "we have indeed observed a continuous variation of the lattice parameters with the thickness of the films .",
    "thus , in order to explain this evolution , we have take into consideration the following features concerning the strains induced by the sto  substrates    \\(i ) the tensile stain along the [ 101 ] direction ( in the plane of the substrate ) can increases both the mn - o - mn angles and mn - o distances in the equatorial plane ( see fig.5a ) .",
    "the increase of the mn - o@xmath44-mn @xcite bond angle increases the bandwith @xcite , the angles tending toward @xmath45 , so that de is involved .",
    "consequently this structural effect should destabilize the co / oo  state and favor the @xmath9 .",
    "the increase of the mn - o bond length induces the antagonist effect , favoring the distortion of the mno@xmath46 octahedra , i.e. the jahn - teller distortion , so that the co / oo  state should be stabilized .",
    "\\(ii ) the compression of the structure along the [ 010 ] direction ( along the out - of - plane direction on sto ) , which appears simultaneously , results in a decrease of the mn - o@xmath47-mn @xcite angle along this direction .",
    "consequently , this decreases the bandwidth and stabilizes the co / oo  state .",
    "\\(iii ) in the @xmath28 structure ( such as ncmo ) , there are eight mn - o@xmath44-mn bonds against four mn - o@xmath47-mn bons .",
    "thus , the bandwidth along the mn - o@xmath48  is consistently larger than the bandwidth along the mn - o@xmath47 direction which indiquates that the de along the [ 101 ] direction prevails over the [ 010 ] direction @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) viewing these remarks , it is reasonable to assume that the substrate - induced strains modify in a first step the tilting of the octahedra , i.e. the mn - o - mn angles and only in a second step the mn - o bond lengths in the plane of the substrate .    for the larger films thickness ( @xmath49 ) , the cell parameters are close to those of the bulk leading consequently to a tilting of the octahedra rather than a modification of the bond lengths . in other words ,",
    "the variation of the mn - o - mn angles prevails over the variation of the mn - o distances .",
    "thus , as @xmath50 increases the mn - o@xmath44-mn angles increases with respect to the bulk .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath51 decreases the mn - o@xmath47-mn angle decreases , resulting in an increase of the bandwidth along the [ 101 ] direction and a decrease of the bandwidth along the [ 010 ] direction.but as pointed out above , the first effect prevails over the second one . as a consequence ,",
    "the de favored with respect to the bulk , so that the co / oostate is less stable and an @xmath9 is obtained under a 7 t magnetic field contrary to the bulk .",
    "as the thickness of the film decreases from 2000 , @xmath50 increases significantly so the mn - o@xmath44-mn bond angle reached 180@xmath52 rapidly and the mn - o@xmath44 bond length increases .",
    "the increase of the mn - o@xmath48 distance induces a jt  distortion of the octahedra , stabilizing the co / oo  state at the detriment of the @xmath9 transition .",
    "this explains why the @xmath34 transition increases as the thickness of the film decreases and the @xmath9 transition under 7 t decreases correlatively .",
    "finally , for the smaller film thickness ( @xmath43 ) , the @xmath50 is very close to the sto  parameter , and the bond angle mn - o@xmath44 effects prevails over the mn - o@xmath44-mn effect , so that the co / oo state is the most stable . note that the simultaneous decrease of the @xmath51 , i.e. decrease of mn - o@xmath47-mn also favors the stabilization of the co / oo  state .    in the case of ncmo films grown on lao ,",
    "the substrate - induced strains lead in fact to rather similar effects .",
    "indeed , one observes a compression along the [ 010]-axis in the plane of the substrate . as shown in fig.5b , this induces a decreases of the mn - o@xmath47-mn angles and of the mn - o@xmath47 bond lengths similar to what occurs for sto ; an increase of the mn - o@xmath44-mn out - of - plane bond angle is induced , but in this case the increase of the mn - o@xmath44 bond distance does not prevail over the mn - o@xmath44-mn angle ( not imposed by the substrate ) . for small thickness ( @xmath43 ) , the @xmath9transition is favored with respect to the co / oo  state .",
    "in conclusion , we grown high quality thin films of nd@xmath11ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 on srtio@xmath4 and laalo@xmath4 using the pld technique .",
    "we have shown that we are able to induce an insulator - to - metal transition at a magnetic field much lower than the corresponding bulk compound by the modification of the structure through the utilization of the appropriate substrate .",
    "moreover the substrate - induced strains increases the mn - o@xmath44-mn bond angles on both lao and sto substrates ( even if the orientation of the film is different ) favoring the double exchange and consequently destabilizing the charge / orbital state leading to a decrease of the critical magnetic field as compared to the bulk .",
