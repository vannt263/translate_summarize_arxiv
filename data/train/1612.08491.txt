    "cosmological measurements usually rely on the use of integrated ( luminosity or angular ) distances , which unavoidably introduces a model dependence in the data themselves .",
    "for example , the use of type ia supernovae as ` standard candles ' to measure the distance scale relies on finding the ` correct ' lightcurve shape needed to determine their absolute luminosity .",
    "the parameters defining this estimator are optimized along with the parameters of the assumed cosmological model , necessitating a recalibration of the data for each and every model being tested ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; riess et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; melia 2012 ; wei et al . 2013 ) .",
    "galaxies evolving passively on a time scale much larger than their age difference can instead be used to measure the expansion rate @xmath0 using solely the local redshift - time derivative @xmath1 ( jimenez & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "as we shall explain in greater detail below , these are typically massive ( with a stellar content @xmath6 ) early - type galaxies that formed over @xmath7 of their stellar mass at high - redshifts ( @xmath8 , i.e. , before the universe was @xmath9 gyr old ) very rapidly ( in only @xmath10 gyr ) and have experienced only minor subsequent episodes of star formation .",
    "they are believed to be the oldest objects at all redshifts ( treu et al .",
    "2005 ) , and if we observe them at @xmath11 ( i.e. , when the universe was @xmath12 gyr old ) , we see a stellar population that mostly formed during the first @xmath13 of the galaxies evolution .",
    "these so - called cosmic chronometers therefore avoid the need of pre - assuming a cosmological model in order to extract the data , and can therefore form a powerful discriminant to test different expansion scenarios .    in previous applications , we ( melia  maier 2013 ; melia & mcclintock 2015 ) used the then available catalog of sources to compare two specific models : the @xmath14 universe ( melia 2007 , 2016a , 2017 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) and the standard ( concordance ) @xmath2cdm model . in these",
    "one - on - one comparative tests , the use of information criteria showed that the cosmic chronometers strongly preferred @xmath14 over @xmath2cdm .",
    "the significance of this result is that , whereas the standard model requires a transition from deceleration at large redshifts to an accelerated expansion today , the @xmath14 universe predicts a constant expansion rate at all redshifts .",
    "recently , however , 5 new , valuable data points were added to the compilation of @xmath0 measurements at that critical redshift ( @xmath15 ) where the transition is thought to have occurred ( moresco et al .",
    "2016 ) , thereby improving the statistical significance of the fits in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "based on a study of this expanded sample , direct evidence for the existence of an epoch of cosmic re - acceleration was claimed to have been seen . to reach this result , however , the locally measured",
    ", high value of @xmath4 had to be included in the data set .",
    "yet this determination of the hubble constant is completely distinct from all the other measurements based on the cosmic chronometers themselves . in this paper",
    ", we argue that this step has unduly biased this recent analysis and that  contrary to its conclusion  the expanded sample in fact strengthens the case for a constant expansion rate in the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "when one ignores the effects of the local gravitational potential at the position of the observer , the value of @xmath4 measured directly from the redshift - distance relation of local sources is discrepant at a level of @xmath18 ( or roughly @xmath19 ) relative to the hubble constant inferred from fitting anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) using @xmath2cdm ( marra et al .",
    "2013 ; planck collaboration 2014 ) . generally speaking",
    ", our observations of the universe are made from a vantage point whose spacetime differs from the mean by a degree that is very difficult to probe with any precision ( valkenburg et al .",
    "estimates of the cosmic variance created by local inhomogeneities are often based on the hubble bubble picture , in which a sphere of matter is carved out of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background , and is compressed or diluted in order to obtain a simple distribution of the ensuing inhomogeneity with a slightly different frw spacetime .",
    "detailed analysis of the dependence of the measurement of @xmath4 on the local gravitational potential has shown that the hubble bubble effect can at least partially mitigate the @xmath20 tension between the cmb and local hubble constants ( marra et al . 2013 ) .",
    "compelling observational support for this interpretation of the disparity is provided by the fact that local measurements of @xmath4 using supernovae within @xmath21 mpc ( corresponding roughly to @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 larger than the value of @xmath4 measured using supernovae outside of this region .",
    "consequently , one can largely alleviate the hubble bubble effect by adopting a minimum redshift of @xmath24 in the analysis of the expansion rate .",
    "the idea that we may be living in a local underdense hubble bubble has actually been considered since the 1990 s ( turner et al .",
    "1992 ; suto et al . 1995",
    "; shi et al . 1996 , 1998 ; zehavi et al . 1998 ; giovanelli et al . 1999 ) . in every case ,",
    "the implied variation on the local gravitational potential was shown to generate variance of the cosmological parameters , including the local hubble constant . the general consensus from all",
    "this work is that the locally measured value of @xmath4 , though obtained in a model - independent fashion , is nonetheless high ( compared to what one might expect in the context of other cosmological measurements ) with systematic uncertainties that are difficult to ascertain with any precision .    for this principal reason ,",
    "we believe that a test of cosmological models using measurements of @xmath0 is more robust when only the truly model - independent data obtained with cosmic chronometers are used , without the contamination introduced through the inclusion of a poorly understood measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "our approach is bolstered by the fact that the results of the model comparisons could not be more different when the locally measured @xmath4 is included versus when it is not , even with exactly the same sample of 30 cosmic - chronometer measurements .",
    "but if the expansion rate measured with this technique firmly points to an epoch of cosmic re - acceleration ( moresco et al .",
    "2016 ) , then this should be seen regardless of whether or not @xmath4 is added to the data set .",
    "to demonstrate this point compellingly , we will here use the most recent sample of 30 cosmic - chronometer measurements to compare seven different models , including @xmath2cdm . in so doing , we shall re - affirm , and strengthen , the conclusions drawn from our previous two studies ( melia & maier 2013 ; melia & mcclintock 2015)that measurements of @xmath0 using cosmic chronometers strongly favour the constant expansion rate predicted by the @xmath14 universe over other models , including @xmath2cdm . the models we will compare are as follows :    1 .   the standard flat @xmath2cdm model , in which the matter and dark - energy densities are fixed by the condition @xmath25 . throughout this paper , @xmath26 is the energy density @xmath27 of species @xmath28 , scaled to today s critical density , @xmath29 . in this model ,",

    ", @xmath4 is the sole free parameter , and @xmath50    we test these models collectively against measurements of the hubble constant using the passively evolving galaxies introduced above , based on the observed 4,000   break in their spectra . for old stellar populations ,",
    "this break is a discontinuity in the spectral continuum due to metal absorption lines whose amplitude correlates linearly with the age and metal abundance of the stars ( moresco et al .",
    "it is weakly dependent on the star formation history , and is basically unaffected by dust reddening . when the metallicity of these stars is known , it is possible to measure the age difference @xmath51 of two nearby galaxies as proportional to the difference in their 4,000   amplitudes .",
    "the slope of this proportionality depends on the metallicity .",
    "then , together with the measured redshift difference @xmath52 of these galaxies , one may find the hubble constant at the average of their redshifts using the simple relation @xmath53 of course , there are several factors that may inhibit the accuracy of this procedure , possibly mitigating the value of using differential measurements of age in these systems .",
    "fortunately , extensive tests ( moresco et al . 2016 ) have shown that the 4,000   feature depends principally on the age and metallicity of the host galaxies , but only weakly on the assumed star formation history , the initial mass function , a possible progenitor bias , and the so - called @xmath54-enhancement .",
    "the latter refers to the observation that these early , passive galaxies have higher ratios of @xmath54 elements to iron than milky - way type galaxies . and",
    "the progenitor bias may arise due to a possible evolution of the mean redshift of formation as a function of redshift of the galaxy samples .    of these effects",
    ", it turns out that only an uncertainty in the metallicity contributes noticeably to a systematic error @xmath55 comparable to the statistical errors in the sample .",
    "simulations have shown that the progenitor bias contributes at most only a few percentage points to @xmath55 , while the impact of the initial mass function is insignificant .",
    "the difference between the 4,000   amplitudes estimated in a single stellar population using a chabrier or salpeter initial mass function is less than @xmath56 for all reasonable metallicities and less than @xmath57 for the solar metallicity ( moresco et al .",
    "the difference in the 4,000   amplitudes due to the @xmath54-enhancement is likewise extremely small , on average only @xmath58 .",
    "the only factor other than metallicity that contributes noticeably to @xmath55 is the star formation history .",
    "again , simulations have shown that variations in the assumed star forming rate can lead to @xmath59 errors in the inferred value of @xmath52 from measurements of the 4,000   amplitudes ( moresco et al .",
    "together , the combination of uncertainties in the star formation history and the metallicity contribute an overall error of about @xmath60 to @xmath61 , and hence the inferred value of @xmath0 .     versus @xmath62 , with error bars , and the best - fit curves from four models ( see text ) .",

    "( 2006 ) , among others , a fair statistical comparison between models with different formulations and numbers of free parameters must be based on the use of information criteria ( takeuchi 2000 ; tan & biswas 2012 ) . in this context , the likelihood of model @xmath54 being the best choice is given by the expression @xmath64 where ic@xmath65 is one of aic@xmath65 , kic@xmath65 , or bic@xmath65 , and the sum in the denominator runs over all the models being tested simultaneously .",

    "<S> whereas many measurements in cosmology depend on the use of integrated distances or time , galaxies evolving passively on a time scale much longer than their age difference allow us to determine the expansion rate @xmath0 solely as a function of the redshift - time derivative @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these model - independent ` cosmic chronometers ' can therefore be powerful discriminators for testing different cosmologies . in previous applications , the available sources strongly disfavoured models ( such as @xmath2cdm ) predicting a variable acceleration , preferring instead a steady expansion rate over the redshift range @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a more recent catalog of 30 objects appears to suggest non - steady expansion . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such a result is entirely due to the inclusion of a high , locally - inferred value of the hubble constant @xmath4 as an additional datum in a set of otherwise pure cosmic - chronometer measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath4 , however , is not the same as the background hubble constant if the local expansion rate is influenced by a hubble bubble . </S>",
    "<S> used on their own , the cosmic chronometers completely reverse this conclusion , favouring instead a constant expansion rate out to @xmath5 . </S>"
