    "from various experimental and theoretical studies during the past three decades it became clear that the scalar hadronic states can not be incorporated into the ordinary @xmath4 picture based on a simple representation of @xmath5 flavour symmetry @xcite .",
    "some related questions are : why are @xmath1 ( or @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) so broad ? why are @xmath9 and @xmath3 so much narrower ?",
    "why does it seem that we find much more scalar  isoscalar states than we expected ( @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ?",
    "dealing with these problems , models of _ _ dynamical generation _",
    "_ began to offer one possible solution and hence received more and more attention from the community @xcite ( for other approaches , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "models of dynamical generation focus on the unitarization of bare scalar ( seed ) states via strong couplings to intermediate ( hadronic ) states .",
    "( one sometimes also speaks in this context of mesonic dressing or the influence of mesonic clouds @xcite . ) according to them , because of the coupling to hadronic channels , the scalar sector not only escapes from the general approach of the naive quark model , but additional resonances with the same quantum numbers can be generated as poles on the unphysical riemann sheet , usually obtained in the scattering matrix .",
    "in contrast , the mass and decay width of a resonance may be determined by the pole of its full interacting propagator , too  a procedure first proposed by peierls @xcite long ago ( see also refs .",
    "the idea of dynamical generation then means to look  besides for a pole coming from the seed sate  for companion poles on riemann sheets which are accessable due to the allowed decay channels .",
    "for instance , a reasonable model giving the propagator of the scalar  isovector state @xmath2 could automatically yield the corresponding narrow state below @xmath13 gev , the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "following this line , we calculate in this paper the propagators of scalar resonances within two effective models and study the mechanism of dynamical generation by analysing the poles on the appropriate riemann sheet(s ) .",
    "then , to make a connection to the presented models , we summarize a recent work which emphasizes that the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contribution to the decay amplitude is usually negligible in the case of effective hadronic models .",
    "the one - loop approximation yields the inverse propagator of a scalar resonance after applying dyson resummation of the hadronic loop contributions : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the sum of all included channels and @xmath16 is the bare or tree - level mass .",
    "the propagator on the unphysical sheet(s ) is obtained by analytic continuation according to @xmath17 here , the superscript @xmath18 indicates the continued function on the next sheet .",
    "the decay amplitude for each channel is calculated from the relevant interaction terms of the underlying lagrangian . the optical theorem for feynman diagrams",
    "can then be applied to compute the imaginary part of the corresponding self - energy loop @xmath19 , regularized by a gaussian 3d - cutoff function with some cutoff scale @xmath20 ( since we deal with effective models in the low - energy regime to study light mesons , it is reasonable to set @xmath20 between 1 and 2 gev ) .",
    "the real part is finally obtained by the dispersion relation @xmath21 note that in this paper the appropriate sheet to look for poles is taken to be the one closest to the physical region .",
    "our starting point is a toy model with two scalar fields , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , representing the @xmath1 state and ( neutral ) pions , and containing the one - channel decay process @xmath24 : @xmath25 for general studies of this model see refs .",
    "@xcite , while detailed works concerning its pole structure can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    by fixing @xmath20 ,",
    "the remaining free parameters @xmath16 and the coupling constant @xmath26 can be determined if one takes the well - known @xmath6-pole of caprini _ et al . _ @xcite as a correct determination of the @xmath6-mass and -width .",
    "this then requires an additional pole slightly below the two - pion threshold , corresponding to a stable state which is dynamically generated by hadronic interactions .",
    "its trajectory is quite interesting : it is first situated on the real axis of the second sheet for small and intermediate values of @xmath26 , then vanishes for a coupling large enough by slipping into the branch cut and finally appears on the real axis of the first sheet , see tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "note that no experiment has yet indicated a hadronic particle with a mass lower than the two - pion threshold .",
    "we thus can not exclude the possibility of having found a spurious pole ( see also ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the scalar isotriplet was identified as the resonance @xmath2 with a fitted tree - level mass @xmath32 mev .",
    "the relevant interaction part of the lagrangian for the neutral state @xmath33 reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the pseudoscalar mesons and the constants @xmath36 are combinations of the coupling constants and masses taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( values on - shell ) .    for any reasonable cutoff parameter",
    "@xmath20 it turns out that the complex propagator pole on the sheet nearest to the physical region is too close to the real axis , hence yields a decay width that is too small .",
    "this is not in agreement with neither the tree - level result from the model , nor the experiment .",
    "the inclusion of loops in the way as we described above spoils the tree - level result ( at least for the decay width ) .",
    "one should perform a reanalysis with full @xmath0-dependence .",
    "however , we do _ not _ find a companion pole of @xmath2 .",
    "this result does not change upon variations of the parameters .",
    "this may indicate that one should try to include the @xmath3 as a tetraquark state into the elsm and/or perform a full scattering analysis .",

    "is it reasonable to discard this term , for example , as done in the model fit of the elsm in the case of @xmath2 ?",
    "the diagram ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) is proportional to the third power of the coupling constant , which in effective models is usually not a small number .",
    "we evaluate the role of the triangle diagram for the simple scalar field theory of eq .",

    "it turns out that , with the exception of @xmath1 , the nlo correction is negligible .",
