    "rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection is the motion of a fluid contained between two parallel plates which is heated from below and cooled from above @xcite .",
    "a well established feature of the dynamics of the system is the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) .",
    "it plays an important role in natural phenomena , including convection in the arctic ocean , in earth s outer core , in the interior of gaseous giant planets , and in the outer layer of the sun .",
    "the properties of the lsc have recently been intensively studied in experiments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , and models @xcite . for a complete overview of all literature in which certain aspect of the lsc are studied",
    "we refer to the recent review of ahlers , grossmann , and lohse @xcite .    in experiments",
    "the lsc is measured by using thermistors that are embedded in the sidewall , see e.g. @xcite , or by using small thermistors that are placed in the flow at different azimuthal positions and different heights , see e.g. @xcite . since the lsc transports warm ( cold ) fluid from the bottom ( top ) plate up ( down ) the side wall",
    ", the thermistors can detect the location of the up - flow ( down - flow ) by showing a relatively high ( low ) temperature .",
    "in addition , there have also been a number of direct measurements of the lsc by particle image velocimetry ( piv ) and laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) that complement the thermistor method .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of the lsc with results from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "though dnss are limited both in ra and in duration , i.e. in number of lsc turnover times , to smaller values than the experimental analogues the advantage is that in contrast to the experiments the full spatial information is available .",
    "we will take advantage of this in order to verify the algorithms employed in experiments to identify the lsc orientation based on a limited number of probes .",
    "we will introduce two existing methods to determine the lsc orientation over time .",
    "the first method @xcite determines the lsc orientation from a cosine fit to the azimuthal temperature profile measured with the probes .",
    "this method has been extremely successful in revealing important features , i.e. azimuthal meandering , reversals , and cessations , of the lsc @xcite . in the second method the lsc orientation is determined by using a second order polynomial fit around the maximum and the minimum . using this method the sloshing mode of the lsc , which is caused by an off - center motion of the lsc ,",
    "was discovered @xcite .",
    "we note that this can not be obtained by the cosine fit method as this method assumes that there is no off - center motion of the lsc .",
    "so far these procedures have been applied to experimental data where the data of @xmath7 azimuthally equally spaced probes were available .",
    "the benefit of the simulations over the experiments is that it is easy to place a large number of probes in the flow .",
    "here we placed up to @xmath8 azimuthally equally spaced numerical probes at different heights into the numerical rb sample . with an arrangement of up to @xmath8 probes",
    "we can determine how the extracted information on the lsc and plume dynamics depends on the number of probes that is used .",
    "we also visualized the flow by movies that show the flow dynamics in horizontal or vertical planes , see the accompanying material @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_numericalmethod ]",
    "we start with a discussion of the numerical method that has been used .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec_lscmethod ] by a discussion of the traditional methods that are used in experiments to determine the lsc orientation .",
    "based on the results obtained by these methods we discuss the characteristics of the lsc in a @xmath1 ( section [ sec_gamma1 ] ) and @xmath9 ( section [ sec_gamma05 ] ) sample . an important question for both high ra number @xcite and rotating rb convection",
    "@xcite is whether or not there is a single lsc present .",
    "therefore we will discuss a new method in section [ sec_relativelscstrength ] , which is based on the energy in the different fourier modes of the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profile , to determine whether a single lsc is present . in section [ sec_relativelscstrength2 ]",
    "we will look into time resolved properties of the lsc .",
    "the general conclusions of this paper will be presented in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "the flow is solved by numerically integrating the three - dimensional unsteady navier - stokes equations within the boussinesq approximation . for a detailed discussion of the numerical code",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "the flow is simulated in a cylindrical sample in order to keep the geometry identical to the one used in most experiments . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that simulation results obtained with this code agree excellent with experimental results .",
    "the cases we studied are based on the most common experimental setups that are available , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 at an aspect ratio @xmath13 of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "azimuthally equally spaced numerical probes per horizontal plane that provide simultaneous point - wise measurements of the temperature and the three velocity and vorticity components at the heights @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and a distance @xmath19 from the cylinder axis .",
    "grid refinement tests were performed because the region close to the sidewall , where the lsc properties are sampled , is most sensitive from a resolution point of view @xcite .",
    "the simulations are fully resolved according to the criteria of stevens et al . @xcite and",
    "the lsc properties we find do not depend on the grid resolution .",

    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig_s09b_lscposition]a and b. the similarity is expected since the lsc carries warm fluid from the bottom plate up the sidewall and vice versa . to show the influence of this long time averaging we show",

    "when no time averaging is applied the graph looks similar , with some additional peaks due to very small plumes , to the one where the data is averaged over @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_lsc_tempvsw ] shows that the lsc orientation can be determined more precisely from the vertical velocity than from the temperature , even for this relatively high @xmath21 ( i.e. small thermal diffusivity ) .",
    "the difference between the lsc orientation determined from the vertical velocity and the temperature seems to depend on several parameters such as the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 number , and the aspect ratio .",
    "however , at the moment we do not have enough numerical data available to systematically study this .",
    "for @xmath1 the obtained lsc orientation at midheight is the same when the data of only @xmath7 or all @xmath8 probes is used , but not when the data of only @xmath30 probes is used .    from figure [ fig_s09b_lscposition ]",
    "it becomes clear that the lsc orientation , obtained by the polynomial and cosine fit , can differ significantly .",
    "this is due to the off - center motion of the lsc @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_s09b_offcenter ] shows @xmath31 , i.e. the difference between the orientation of the strongest up ( @xmath32 ) and down going motion ( @xmath33 ) obtained using the polynomial fit , fluctuates around @xmath34 . to quantify the strength of these fluctuations we calculate @xmath35 .",
    "the values based on the data of @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) probes per horizontal level for the case presented in figure [ fig_s09b_offcenter ] are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . because the fluctuation strength is the same when",
    "the data of @xmath7 and @xmath8 equally spaced probes per horizontal level are considered we conclude that the use of @xmath7 probes is sufficient to capture these statistics in a @xmath1 sample . in figure [ fig_s09b_torsial ] it is shown that the lsc orientation , obtained using the polynomial fit method , can be different at the different heights .",
    "we note that the same is observed when the lsc orientation based on a cosine fit is considered .",
    "this indicates that the lsc is not always flowing straight up and down , but is also moving in the azimuthal direction , and thus performs twisting motions @xcite .",
    "we note that some phenomena , like the drift of the lsc due to the coriolis force , see ref .",
    "@xcite , can be analyzed using the lsc orientation based on the polynomial and cosine method , because in this case only the long term drift of the lsc is important .    , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively for @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 on the @xmath41 grid .",

    ", width=192 ]    more remarkably is the presence of a specific frequency of approximately @xmath47 in the signal @xmath48 , see figure [ fig_s09b_spectra ] .",
    "this specific frequency seems to be related to the frequency in which plumes are passing the horizontal midplain @xcite , which in our case shows up in the frequency in which plumes are detected on the left and right hand side of the lsc orientation based on the cosine fit , see figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this frequency might also be related to the low frequency mode found already in ref .",
    "@xcite or to the off - center oscillation of the lsc @xcite .",
    "we find this frequency in our simulations for @xmath4 in a @xmath1 sample .",
    "we note that we also find this frequency when we do not apply any time averaging on the data before we determine the lsc orientation .",
    "actually one can already see this phenomenon in figure [ fig_s09b_lscposition]d where @xmath44 fluctuates around @xmath49 with a typical period of about @xmath47 .",
    "further confirmation is obtained when the temporal behavior of the data obtained from the @xmath8 probes at midheight is shown in a movie , see the supplementary material @xcite .",
    "the movie is based on the data obtained from the simulation on the @xmath50 grid at @xmath51 with @xmath4 in a @xmath1 sample .",
    "the movie shows a passing plume at t @xmath52 , see the snapshot of the movie in figure [ fig_s10_snapshotmovie]b , which is indicated by the two peak structure around the maximum position obtained by the cosine fit .",
    "when this plume is passed the double peak structure disappears .",
    "subsequently , the lsc orientation based on the polynomial fit method is smoothly passing the lsc orientation based on the cosine fit . thus showing an off - center motion of the lsc .",
    "we note that having a large number of probes is essential to confirm these plume events .",
    "to show this we made a movie of the same time interval , see the supplementary material @xcite and the snapshot in figure [ fig_s10_snapshotmovie]a , with the data of only @xmath7 probes . from these movies and figure",
    "[ fig_s10_snapshotmovie]a we conclude that it is impossible to see the double peak structure when the data of only @xmath7 probes is used and therefore we can not distinguish the off - center motion of the lsc from passing plumes , when the plumes stretches over two rows of thermistors .     shows a maximum around @xmath47 , which is indicated by the vertical dashed line .",
    "this frequency is caused by plumes that pass the lsc orientation based on the cosine fit on the left and right side .",

    "however , only with the data of @xmath8 equally spaced probes per horizontal level the effect of passing plumes on the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles can be identified .",
    "we now come to the @xmath55 case . for this geometry verzicco and camussi @xcite",
    "have used the data accessibility provided by dns to show that the large scale circulation can be either in a single - roll state ( srs ) or in a double - roll state ( drs ) .",
    "subsequently , a model introduced by stringano and verzicco @xcite found that the switching between the drs and the srs can influence the nusselt number , and can thus be a possible reason for the bimodal behavior of nusselt found in some experiments , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the first extensive experimental study on the transition between the srs and the drs was performed by xi and xia @xcite .",
    "they studied flow mode transition in samples of aspect ratio @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath56 .",
    "figure 10 of their paper @xcite shows the percentages of the time the flow spends in either the srs or the drs .",
    "in addition , they showed that the heat transfer in the srs is higher than in the drs .",
    "recently , weiss & ahlers @xcite have also experimentally investigated the switching between the srs and the drs , but now over a much larger range of @xmath20 than xi and xia @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this work is summarized in figure 11 of ref .",
    "that figure shows that the srs is more dominant at higher @xmath20 and smaller @xmath21 .",
    "they note that they find a good agreement with the results of xi and xia in the @xmath20 number range in which both experiments overlap .",
    "in addition , the work of xi and xia @xcite and weiss and ahlers @xcite showed that the flow state can not always be defined as srs or drs .",
    "this is particularly important for @xmath57 .",

    "supplementary movies that offer a full three dimensional view are provided in the supplementary material @xcite.,width=312 ]    in this paper we will qualitatively confirm these experimental and numerical findings .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this relatively low @xmath20 number regime , namely to @xmath5 : first , in order to directly compare with the @xmath60 case of the previous section , second , because current high @xmath20 number simulations @xcite are too limited in the number of turnover times to obtain sufficient statistics on the different flow states .",
    "our simulations confirm weiss & ahlers s @xcite finding that there is more disorder in a @xmath9 sample than in a @xmath1 sample .",
    "we find that in this low @xmath20 number regime it is important to have a large number of probes to accurately represent the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles to analyze the flow . in this regime",
    "we see that deflection of plumes due to corner rolls and other plumes happens more often than in a @xmath1 sample .",
    "these effects can be observed in the supplementary movies for @xmath9 at @xmath5 and @xmath10 and @xmath4 @xcite . in the movies that show horizontal cuts at the heights @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and",
    "@xmath18 one can see that the hot and cold regions interchange more often in a @xmath9 sample than in a @xmath1 sample .    in order to determine whether there is a srs or a drs in this geometry we determined the probability density function ( pdf ) of the quantity @xmath61 .",
    "when this pdf peaks around zero it means that the fluid is flowing straight up , and this indicates the presence of a srs . when there is a drs the pdf should peak around @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_rollstate ] shows that for @xmath4 in a @xmath1 sample the pdf peaks around zero and this confirms the dominance of the srs in this geometry . for @xmath10 in a @xmath9 sample the figure shows that there is a small peak around zero , but it is much less pronounced than for the @xmath1 case . for @xmath4 in a @xmath9 sample the figure shows that the pdf is nearly uniform , which would suggest that neither the srs or the drs is dominant .",
    "this agrees with the results of weiss & ahlers @xcite , since they find that for @xmath58 and @xmath62 the flow state is poorly defined and no state dominates .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2 ] reveals the origin of these nearly uniform pdfs in the @xmath9 sample by showing three - dimensional visualizations of the regions where the vertical velocities are strongest .",
    "an analysis of these ( and similar figures ) revealed that the uniform pdf is due to the possibility of different flow states , i.e. the srs ( figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]a ) with @xmath63 , the drs ( figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]c ) with @xmath64 , strong corner flows ( figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]b ) which can have any @xmath61 , and strong plume and/or torsional motions ( figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]d ) which also can have any @xmath61 .     for @xmath5 ,",
    "see text for details .",
    "the dashed and solid lines indicate the pdf based on the data of only @xmath7 or all @xmath8 probes equally spaced probes per horizontal level , respectively .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the definition of the srs according to xi and xia @xcite and weiss & ahlers @xcite.,width=312 ]    to better compare our results with the results of weiss & ahlers @xcite we also determined the pdf of the quantity @xmath65 , see figure [ fig_s10_pdfguenter ] . here",
    "@xmath66 means that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are compared with @xmath69 to construct the pdf .",
    "a similar pdf for higher @xmath20 , based on experimental data , can be found in figure 21 of weiss & ahlers @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_pdfguenter ] shows this pdf based on the data of only @xmath7 and all @xmath8 equally spaced probes per horizontal level for the cases of figure [ fig_s10_rollstate ] .",
    "first of all , figure [ fig_s10_pdfguenter ] shows that the drs is much more pronounced for @xmath4 than for @xmath10 , which is in agreement with the results of weiss and ahlers @xcite and the results shown in figure [ fig_s10_rollstate ] .",
    "second , a comparison of the pdfs in figure [ fig_s10_pdfguenter ] reveals that the pdfs based on the data of @xmath7 and all @xmath8 equally spaced probes are almost identical .",
    "the largest difference is visible for @xmath4 in a @xmath1 sample . here",
    "the pdf based on the data of @xmath8 equally spaced probes is more confined in the srs region than the one based on @xmath7 equally spaced probes , because the larger number of probes reduces random fluctuations in the obtained lsc orientation .    , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively , for the flow state indicated in figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]b .",
    "the dots indicate the data of @xmath7 azimuthally equally spaced probes per horizontal plane . based on",
    "the cosine fits ( solid lines ) obtained from this probe data this state would be identified as a drs , while figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]b shows that it is in fact a srs with a strong corner flow .",
    "the dashed lines show that a higher azimuthal resolution can resolve the double peak structure of the corner flow and the main flow .",
    "the temperatures at @xmath16 ( @xmath18 ) have been raised ( lowered ) by @xmath70 for clarity .",
    ", width=312 ]    furthermore , and this is the main issue here , for this relatively low ra sometimes the data of three rows of @xmath7 thermistors can give misleading hints for the actual flow state of the system due to the effect of passing plumes and corner rolls on the azimuthal profiles .",
    "the importance of these effects is shown in figure [ fig_s09b_profiles ] .",
    "this figure shows that based on the data of @xmath7 azimuthally equally spaced probes at each horizontal level the flow structure shown in figure [ fig_s10_rollstate2]b , which is a srs with a strong corner flow , would be identified as a drs .",
    "in addition , the figure shows that the full azimuthal temperature profiles reveal that a higher azimuthal resolution ( e.g. , @xmath8 instead of only @xmath7 probes ) could resolve the double peak structure ( originating from the coexistence of the srs with some corner flow ) , which makes it possible to distinguish this state from a real drs .",
    "we note that the experiments of weiss & ahlers @xcite show that for @xmath58 and @xmath62 the flow state is undefined for about @xmath59 of the time . in the experiments",
    "the srs only establishes itself for higher @xmath20 , where the flow state is much better defined , as the area of the corner flow becomes smaller and smaller @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that the examples presented here are primarily important in the low @xmath20 number regime investigated here and are much less common in the higher @xmath20 number regime considered in most experiments .",
    "we stress however that one does not know a priori whether one is in a difficult case or in a case where the method works fine .",
    "therefore we feel that it is important to realize that there are some limitations in the methods to determine the flow state from three rows of @xmath7 equally spaced thermistors .",
    "an example of such a difficult case is the breakdown of the lsc when a strong rotation is applied around the cylinder axis @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous temperature profiles in figure [ fig_s09b_profiles ] show that the lsc is not always clearly present , meaning that the cosine fit becomes poor . in order to study this in more detail",
    ", we introduce the concept of the relative lsc strength , which we define as the strength of the lsc , i.e. the cosine mode , with respect to the strength of the plumes and turbulent fluctuations , i.e. the fluctuations around the cosine fit .    a convenient way to define a relative lsc strength that is independent of the number of probes is to determine the energy in the different fourier modes of the azimuthal temperature or the azimuthal vertical velocity profile . in order to obtain a relative lsc strength @xmath71 with a number between @xmath72 and @xmath14 we normalize the energy in the first fourier mode , i.e.   the cosine mode , as follows : @xmath73 here @xmath74 indicates the sum of the energy in the first fourier mode over time , i.e. from the beginning of the simulation @xmath75 to the end of the simulation @xmath76 , @xmath77 the sum of the total energy in all fourier modes over time , and @xmath78 the total number of fourier modes that can be determined . note that the factor @xmath79 is only used to subtract the part of energy coming from the equi - distribution among all the modes .",

    ".    here we will only determine @xmath85 for the middle row of thermistors , thus only @xmath86 .",
    "we note that the lsc amplitude @xmath87 and the phase @xmath88 of the first fourier mode are identical to the ones determined when using the least square fit in equation ( [ eq cosine fit ] ) .",
    "we moreover note that the quantity @xmath85 is _ not _ time resolved and thus does not allow to study the switching between the srs and drs @xcite .",
    "results on time - resolved relative lsc strengths will be presented in the next section .",
    "the normalization in eq .",
    "( [ eq relative strength lsc ] ) has been chosen such that the relative lsc strength @xmath86 always has a value between @xmath72 and @xmath14 : the value @xmath14 indicates that the azimuthal profile is a pure cosine profile , which is a signature of the lsc according to @xcite , and the value @xmath72 indicates that the magnitude of the cosine mode is equal to ( or weaker than ) the value expected from a random noise signal .",
    "@xmath89 indicates that the cosine fit on average is a reasonable approximation of the data , as then most energy in the signal is in the first fourier mode , i.e.  the cosine mode .",
    "in contrast , @xmath90 indicates that most energy is in the higher fourier modes , meaning that the application of a cosine fit to the data becomes questionable .",
    "somehow arbitrary , we define the srs as dominant once @xmath91 .    to further demonstrate these properties of @xmath85 , we analyze the test function @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a set of gaussian distributed random numbers with a certain standard deviation @xmath95 , the `` time '' @xmath96 is varied between @xmath14 and @xmath97 , and the noise is supposed to model the effect of turbulent fluctuations around the cosine fit .",

    "it will work for cases for which @xmath101 is large .",
    "however , when @xmath101 is low , this method gives misleading results as is shown in figure [ fig_s10_cosineaverage ] where we apply it to above discussed data for @xmath4 in the @xmath9 sample , where the relative lsc strength using the data of all @xmath8 probes in the horizontal level is @xmath105 ( see table [ table1 ] ) : the average profile obtained with the method of refs .",
    "@xcite can not be distinguished from the ones obtained from the cases where @xmath101 is larger and therefore the method can not be used to claim the dominance of the srs .",
    "the relative lsc strength can also be calculated on instantaneous azimuthal temperature and vertical velocity profiles .",
    "we demonstrate this by constructing the pdf of the relative lsc strength at midheight @xmath106 for instantaneous azimuthal temperature and vertical velocity profiles using the definition @xmath107 the only difference with respect to equation ( [ eq relative strength lsc ] ) is that @xmath108 and @xmath109 and thus @xmath106 are time dependent and that we have dropped the criterion that the minimal value should be @xmath72 .",
    "the reason for the latter is that we want to prevent strange jumps in the pdfs of @xmath86 at 0 . for @xmath7 probes we have @xmath110 and for @xmath8 probes we have @xmath111 .",
    "note that these intervals follow directly from equation [ eq relative strength lsc2 ] by filling in the limiting cases , i.e.  @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and by using the relation @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the number of probes , see previous section .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_pdf_s_m ] shows the pdfs for @xmath86 based on the measurement of the vertical velocity by only @xmath7 or all @xmath8 equally spaced probes at midheight in the simulation with @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and in the @xmath116 sample .",
    "in addition , for both cases we determined the distribution of @xmath106 for a random signal .",
    "when we compare the pdfs based on the simulation data with the distributions obtained for random signals , we see that the difference is relatively small when the data of only @xmath7 probes is considered , whereas a much larger difference is obtained when the data of all @xmath8 probes is taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig_s10_pdf_s_m ] thus clearly shows that it can be beneficial to use more than @xmath7 azimuthally equally spaced probes , since it becomes much easier to show that certain events are statistically relevant .",
    "we studied the lsc dynamics in dns simulations by investigating the azimuthal temperature and vertical velocity profiles obtained from @xmath8 equally spaced numerical probes at three different heights . for @xmath4 in a @xmath1 sample we find that the azimuthal profile is well presented with the data of @xmath7 numerical probes , a number normally used in experiments , as the lsc orientation obtained by a cosine fit is the same when the data of @xmath7 and @xmath8 probes is considered .",
    "we find that the improved azimuthal resolution ( 64 instead of 8 probes in the sidewall at one height ) can reveal the effect of the plumes .    in agreement with the findings of xi and xia @xcite and weiss and ahlers",
    "@xcite we find that there is more disorder present in the @xmath9 sample than in the @xmath1 sample .",
    "for the @xmath103 case we also show that when the azimuthal temperature profile is only determined from @xmath7 probes per horizontal level a srs can erroneously be identified as a drs , because the azimuthal resolution is too small to distinguish between the structure of the corner flow and the main roll . here",
    "we again stress that this result is obtained in the relatively low @xmath20 number regime .",
    "the experimental results of weiss & ahlers @xcite show that for the low @xmath20 number regime the flow state is undefined for about @xmath59 of the time . for @xmath103",
    "the srs only establishes itself for higher @xmath20 , where the flow state is much better defined @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that the examples presented here are primarily important in this low @xmath20 number regime investigated here and are much less common in the higher @xmath20 number regime .",
    "we quantified the lsc strength relative to the turbulent fluctuations by determining the ratio between the energy in the first fourier mode and the energy in all fourier modes of the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles .",
    "we find that the relative lsc strength at @xmath5 is considerably lower in the @xmath9 sample than in the @xmath1 sample , i.e.  that the srs is much less pronounced in the @xmath9 sample than in the @xmath1 sample .",
    "this determination of the relative lsc strength can be applied directly to available experimental data to determine whether the srs is present in high ra number thermal convection and in rotating rb convection .    _",
