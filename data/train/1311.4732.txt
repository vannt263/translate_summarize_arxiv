    "the @xmath0 dibaryon , a six quark ( @xmath7 ) state corresponding asymptotically to a bound @xmath8 system , was first proposed by jaffe in 1977  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis initiated a worldwide activity of theoretical studies and experimental searches for dibaryon states  @xcite . in 1987 , m. oka @xmath9 claimed that a sharp resonance appears in @xmath10 @xmath8 scattering at @xmath11 mev , which might correspond to the @xmath0 dibaryon state  @xcite .",
    "moreover , m. oka also proposed several @xmath12 dibaryons in the quark cluster model without meson exchange  @xcite . despite numerous claims ,",
    "no dibaryon candidate has been confirmed experimentally so far .",
    "recntly , the interest in the @xmath0 dibaryon have been revived by lattice qcd calculations of different collaborations , nplqcd  @xcite and halqcd  @xcite .",
    "these two groups reported that the @xmath0 particle is indeed a bound state at pion masses larger than the physical ones .",
    "then , carames and valcarce examined the @xmath0 dibaryon within a chiral constituent quark model and obtained a bound @xmath0 dibaryon with binding energy @xmath13 mev  @xcite .    understanding the hadron - hadron interactions and searching exotic quark states are important topics in temporary hadron physics .",
    "recently observed many near - threshold charmonium - like states , such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , triggered lots of studies on the molecule - like bound states containing heavy quark hadrons .",
    "such a study may help us to understand further the hadron - hadron interactions . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "the large masses of the heavy baryons reduce the kinetic of the system , which makes it easier to form bound states . one may wonder whether a @xmath0-like dibaryon state @xmath1 exist or not .    in particular",
    ", the deuteron is a loosely bound state of a proton and a neutron , which may be regarded as a hadronic molecular state .",
    "the possibility of existing deuteron - like states , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and so on , were investigated by several realistic phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 system and relevant coupled channel effects were both studied on hadron level  @xcite and on quark level  @xcite .",
    "however , some different results were obtained by these two methods . on hadron level  @xcite",
    ", it is found that molecular bound states of @xmath21 are plausible in both the one - pion - exchange potential model and the one - boson - exchange potential model . on quark level  @xcite ,",
    "our group found the attraction between @xmath22 and @xmath3 is not strong enough to form any @xmath21 bound state within our quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm ) .",
    "whereas the attraction between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is strong enough to form a bound state @xmath24 , it becomes a resonance state by coupling to the open @xmath21 @xmath25wave channels .",
    "we also explored the corresponding states @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the similar properties as that of states @xmath21 , @xmath17 were obtained .",
    "recently , the possible @xmath1 molecular state was studied in the one - boson - exchange potential model  @xcite and in the one - pion - exchange potential model  @xcite on hadron level .",
    "different results were obtained by these two models .",
    "the @xmath1 does not exist in the former model , whereas the molecular bound state of @xmath1 is possible in the later model .",
    "so the quark level study of the @xmath1 system is interesting and necessary .",
    "the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm ) was developed in the 1990s with the aim of explaining the similarities between nuclear and molecular forces  @xcite .",
    "the model gives a good description of @xmath28 and @xmath29 interactions and the properties of deuteron  @xcite .",
    "it is also employed to calculate the baryon - baryon scattering phase shifts in the framework of the resonating group method ( rgm ) , and the dibaryon candidates are also studied with this model  @xcite .",
    "recent study also show that the intermediate - range attraction mechanism in the qdcsm , quark delocalization and color screening , is an alternative mechanism for the @xmath30-meson exchange in the most common quark model , the chiral quark model  @xcite . in the frame of qdcsm ,",
    "the @xmath0 dibaryon were also obtained  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to investigate whether a @xmath0-like dibaryon state @xmath1 exist or not in qdcsm .    in present work , qdcsm is employed to study the properties of @xmath1 systems .",
    "the channel - coupling effect of @xmath4 , @xmath31 , @xmath5 and @xmath19 are included .",
    "our purpose is to understand the interaction properties of the @xmath1 system and to see whether an @xmath0-like dibaryon state @xmath1 exist or not .",
    "extension of the study to the bottom case is also interesting and is performed here .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present a brief introduction of the quark models used in section ii . section iii devotes to the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the summary is shown in the last section .",
    "the detail of qdcsm used in the present work can be found in the references  @xcite . here , we just present the salient features of the model .",
    "the model hamiltonian is :      where @xmath33 is quark tensor operator , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are standard yukawa functions  @xcite , @xmath37 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass , @xmath38 is the chiral coupling constant , determined as usual from the @xmath39-nucleon coupling constant .",
    "all other symbols have their usual meanings . here",
    ", a phenomenological color screening confinement potential is used , and @xmath40 is the color screening parameter . for the light - flavor quark system ,",
    "it is determined by fitting the deuteron properties , @xmath28 scattering phase shifts , @xmath41 and @xmath42 scattering phase shifts , respectively , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , satisfying the relation @xmath46",
    "when extending to the heavy quark case , there is no experimental data available , so we take it as a common parameter . in the present work ,",
    "we take @xmath47 and @xmath48 , also satisfy the relation @xmath49 .",
    "all the other parameters are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the quark delocalization in qdcsm is realized by specifying the single particle orbital wave function of qdcsm as a linear combination of left and right gaussians , the single particle orbital wave functions used in the ordinary quark cluster model , @xmath50 here @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the generating coordinates , which are introduced to expand the relative motion wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath53 is not an adjusted one but determined variationally by the dynamics of the multi - quark system itself .",
    "this assumption allows the multi - quark system to choose its favorable configuration in the interacting process .",
    "it has been used to explain the cross - over transition between hadron phase and quark - gluon plasma phase  @xcite .",
    "here , we perform a dynamical investigation of the @xmath1 system with @xmath54 in the qdcsm . the channel coupling effects are also considered .",
    "the labels of all coupled channels are listed in table [ channels ] .",
    ".the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states and the channels coupled to them . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bound_b ]",
    "in this work , we perform a dynamical calculation of the @xmath1 system with @xmath54 in the framework of qdcsm .",
    "our results show that the interaction between two @xmath3 s is repulsive , so it can not be a bound state by itself .",
    "the attractions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels are strong enough to bind two @xmath23 s and two @xmath55 s together .",
    "it is possible to form a @xmath0-like dibaryon state in the @xmath1 system with the binding energy @xmath6 mev in our quark model by including the channel - coupling effect .",
    "this result is consistent with the result of the calculation on the hadron level  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of the channel coupling is different between these two approaches .",
    "the role of the central force is much more important than the tensor force in our quark level calculation , while in the calculation on the hadron level  @xcite , the tensor force is shown to be important and the @xmath56-wave channels are crucial in binding two @xmath3 s . further investigation should be done to understand the difference between the approaches on the hadron level and the quark level .",
    "it will help us to understand the quark - duality and exotic quark states .",
    "extension of the study to the bottom case has also been done .",
    "the results of @xmath2 system is similar to the @xmath1 system , and there exits a @xmath0-like dibaryon state in the @xmath2 system with a binding energy of @xmath57 mev in our quark model . on the experimental side ,",
    "finding the @xmath0-like dibaryon states @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be a challenging subject .",
