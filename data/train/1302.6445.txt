    "in four dimensional @xmath0 theory the period map assigns positive real numbers to 4-regular internally 6-connected graphs @xcite .",
    "the periods determine the contributions of primitive logarithmically divergent graphs to the beta function of the underlying quantum field theory .",
    "although periods are originally associated to sub - divergence free four - pointgraphs , it is convenient to complete the graph by adding an extra vertex ( henceforth labeled @xmath1 ) and gluing this vertex to the four external ( half-)edges of the graph . as a remnant of conformal symmetry one can consider the completed graph as an equivalence class of four - point graphs ( obtained by opening up a vertex ) with the same period ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 : completed ( @xmath2 ) and uncompleted ( @xmath3 ) zig - zag graphs with five and six loops .",
    "2ex    the structure of @xmath0 periods were first studied systematically by broadhurst and kreimer in 1995 @xcite when they found by exact numerical methods that up to seven loops ( the number of independent cycles in the four - point graph ) many periods are multiple zeta values ( mzvs ) , i.e.  rational linear combinations of multiple zeta sums @xmath4 multiple zeta values span a @xmath5 vector space @xmath6 which is conjectured to be graded by the weight @xmath7",
    ".    there are four equivalent ways to define the period of a graph : position space , momentum space , parametric space , and dual parametric space @xcite . in the context of algebraic geometry",
    "one often uses feynman ( or schwinger ) parameters @xcite , @xcite . in this article , however , it is essential to use position space .",
    "figure 2 : position space feynman rules : edges correspond to quadrics ( or 1 ) .",
    "2ex    in a completed feynman graph we label the @xmath8 vertices by @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 , where 0 is the origin of @xmath15 , 1 corresponds to a unit vector @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "edges of the feynman graph correspond to propagators .",
    "the propagator is the constant function 1 if the edge has one vertix @xmath1 or if it connects 0 and 1 .",
    "otherwise the propagator of an edge @xmath19 from @xmath20 to @xmath21 is the inverse of the quadric @xmath22 the period of the completed feynman graph @xmath23 is then given by the @xmath24-dimensional integral @xmath25 where the products are over vertices @xmath26 and edges @xmath19 of @xmath23 .    because edges that connect to infinity do not contribute to the integral we can remove infinity before we apply the feynman rules .",
    "it is often useful to generalize the definition of a period to non-@xmath0 graphs .",
    "the fourier identity @xcite , for example , maps @xmath0 graphs to non-@xmath0 graphs without changing the period . this map will be used to link the period of the zig - zag graphs to the sequential family of graphs defined in the next subsection .",
    "although completion is also possible for non-@xmath0 graphs if one introduces edges of negative weights ( similar to  [ completion ] ) we use non-@xmath0 graphs in an uncompleted form . in this form graphs",
    "have no vertex @xmath1 and the definition of the period ( [ pdef ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "we use capital greek letters for completed and latin letters for uncompleted graphs .",
    "position space feynman rules were used in @xcite and in most calculations of feynman periods .",
    "in fact , so far only eight @xmath0 periods have been calculated : the trivial period 1 ( @xmath27 ) , the wheels with three @xcite and with four @xcite spokes which are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the period of the zig - zag graph ( see figure 1 ) with 5 loops was calculated by kazakov in 1983 @xcite .",
    "the 6 loop zig - zag period was derived by broadhurst in 1985 @xcite and confirmed by ussyukina in 1991 @xcite .",
    "the only calculated non zig - zag periods are @xmath30 in @xcite which is @xmath31 in @xcite , @xmath32 by e. panzer in 2012 , and the bipartite graph @xmath33 in @xcite which is @xmath34 in @xcite . by exact numerical methods",
    "24 more periods are known up to eight loops @xcite , @xcite all of which are mzvs .",
    "the zig - zag periods were conjectured to all orders in @xcite :    ( zig - zag conjecture ) .",
    "the period of the graph @xmath35 is given by @xmath36    in spite of its seeming simplicity the zig - zag conjecture remained open for 17 years .",
    "although all known @xmath0 periods are mzvs it is conjectured with strong mathematical evidence that @xmath0 periods in general are non mzv @xcite , @xcite .    in this article",
    "we develop a method that allows one to calculate the zig - zag periods and two more families of @xmath0 periods ( and sequential non-@xmath0 periods ) .",
    "modulo products of mzvs an explicit formula for these periods is given .",
    "for a more general class of constructible periods we present a computer algorithm that works up to ten loops .    finally , the zig - zag conjecture is proved in @xcite using corollary [ maincor ] .",
    "an important family of graphs can be encoded by words in the three letter alphabet @xmath37 .",
    "figure 3 : the sequential graph @xmath38 .",
    "2ex    let @xmath39 be a word in 0,1,2 .",
    "the sequential graph @xmath40 is the graph with two distinguished vertices 0 and 1 and a horizontal chain of vertices that connect either to 0 , to 1 , or to both 0 and 1 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "reading from left to right the connections are encoded in the letters 0 , 1 , or 2 , respectively .",
    "sequential graphs have well - defined periods @xmath41 in four dimensions if the word @xmath39 begins and ends in 2 ( corollary [ pwelldef ] ) .",
    "certain sequential graphs are related by duality to zig - zag graphs . with the notation @xmath42 for the @xmath43 fold iteration of a word @xmath39",
    "the graphical dual @xmath44 of the uncompleted zig - zag graph with @xmath43 loops is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the edge 01 .",
    "because the period of an uncompleted graph with a planar embedding equals the period of its planar dual @xcite , @xcite we can express the zig - zag period in terms of the period of a sequential graph , @xmath47 sequential graphs were independently analysed in @xcite .",
    "a graphical function is the evaluation of a graph @xmath48 with three distinguished vertices @xmath49 with position space feynman rules and no integration over @xmath50 , @xmath51 here we assume four dimensions .",

    "a special case is graphical functions in two dimensions which we will define in  [ 2d ] .    by symmetry @xmath52",
    "depends only on two real parameters : the norm @xmath53 and the angle between @xmath50 and the unit vector @xmath16",
    ". we can hence consider @xmath52 as a function on the complex plane @xmath54 where we identify @xmath16 with 1 and choose any of the two possible orientations .",
    "graphical functions are single - valued functions which in many cases can be proved to be real analytic in @xmath55 .",
    "independence of the orientation of @xmath54 results in the reflection symmetry @xmath56    figure 4 : the graphical functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "2ex    sequential graphs give rise to sequential functions by appending a horizontal edge connected to @xmath50 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the four dimensional graphical function @xmath59 serves as an initial case for constructing sequential functions .",
    "the sequential function @xmath60 is well - defined in four dimensions if the word @xmath39 begins with 2 ( lemma [ convergencelemma ] ) .",
    "zig - zag periods can be expressed as special values of sequential functions at 0 or 1 , @xmath61      for any word @xmath39 in the two letter alphabet @xmath62 we inductively define multiple polylogarithms @xmath63 by @xmath64 and @xmath65 unless @xmath66 in which case we have @xmath67 .",

    "a residue theorem in  [ residue ] facilitates the integration of functions in @xmath83 over the complex plane . in practice the integration over",
    "the complex plane is more memory and time consuming so that the implementation is limited to smaller weights .",
    "the connection to graphical functions is established by the fact that in many cases graphical functions are expressible in terms of svmps in the sense that @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the vector space of such @xmath89 .",
    "likewise we define @xmath90 as the set of functions ( [ fgina ] ) where @xmath91 . an example is @xmath92 , ( [ fi ] ) , which is in @xmath88 but not in @xmath93 . by corollary [ maincor ] all sequential functions @xmath94 are in @xmath93 .",
    "there exist relations between graphical functions of different graphs .",
    "the best way to formulate these relations is by completing the graph .",
    "the completion is obtained by adding a vertex @xmath1 in much the same way as for periods .",
    "the completed graph has four labeled vertices @xmath95 .",
    "for some edges @xmath19 in the completed graph we need to introduce propagators of negative integer weight @xmath96 which correspond to quadrics @xmath97 in the numerator of the integral ( [ fdef4completed ] ) .",
    "graphically we indicate negative weight propagators by multiple curly lines .",
    "completion adds edges to @xmath1 and from 0 to 1 in such a way that all unlabeled vertices have total degree four and the vertices @xmath95 have total degree zero ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "completion is always possible and unique ( lemma [ completionlemma ] ) .",
    "figure 5 : the completion of the graphical functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "2ex    in four dimensions the graphical function of a completed graph @xmath23 is given by @xmath98 clearly , a graphical function does not change under completion , @xmath99 because only completed graphs have a vertex @xmath1 we use the same symbol for their graphical functions .",
    "now , a permutation of the four labels @xmath95 changes the graphical function only by a mbius transformation of the argument that permutes the points @xmath100 in @xmath101 .",
    "more precisely , we denote the group of permutations of four elements by @xmath102 .",
    "it has a normal subgroup @xmath103 with factor group @xmath104 , permuting the three points @xmath100 .",
    "this @xmath104 acts on the argument @xmath50 by the transformations @xmath105 .",
    "concretely , the @xmath102 is generated by the three transpositions @xmath106 where we indicate the action of the @xmath104 by transforming the label @xmath50 .",
    "the action on @xmath50 is such that it fixes the cross - ratio of the four labels .",
    "it maps @xmath88 into @xmath88 and @xmath93 into @xmath93 so that the class of graphical functions that is expressible in terms of svmps in the sense of ( [ fgina ] ) is invariant under the permutation of external labels .      figure 6 : appending an edge to the vertex @xmath50 in @xmath48 gives @xmath107 .",
    "2ex    a key result in the theory of graphical functions is that in many cases the graphical function is mapped from @xmath88 into @xmath93 by appending an edge to the vertex @xmath50 ( see figure 6 ) . under quite general assumptions given in theorem [ appendthm ]",
    "we obtain @xmath108 the simplicity of this equation is special to four dimensions . in arbitrary dimensions appending an edge",
    "is significantly more complicated , see proposition [ appendprop ] .",
    "we have seen that permuting the labeled vertices and appending an edge to @xmath50 maps @xmath88 into @xmath88 .",
    "a third operation that is trivially of this type is adding an edge that connects two labeled vertices .",
    "in fact , this edge contributes non - trivially to the graphical function only when it connects 0 or 1 to @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the graphical function picks up a factor of @xmath109 or @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the empty graph with four vertices is the completion of the sequential graph of the empty word .",
    "its graphical function is one , @xmath111 with the help of the above three transformations we can construct graphs from the empty graph and calculate their graphical functions ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "figure 7 : construction of graphical functions which are in @xmath88 .",
    "the bullets @xmath112 stand for one of the four labels @xmath95 and @xmath113 is a permutation of @xmath95 together with a transformation of @xmath50 which is generated by ( [ s4trafos ] ) .",
    "2ex    for these constructible graphs the graphical functions can be calculated by computer up to weights @xmath114 which corresponds to 15 internal ( unlabeled ) vertices .",
    "in particular , all sequential graphs are constructible .",
    "the periods of completed primitive feynman graphs can be calculated by using two - dimensional complex integration if the graph decomposes into at most two constructible graphs under the following steps :    * label four vertices by @xmath95 . *",

    "a 2 followed by a string of 0s which contains one 1 , see @xcite , and for the zig - zag graphs in @xcite leading to the proof of the zig - zag conjecture . one practical option to obtain general results",
