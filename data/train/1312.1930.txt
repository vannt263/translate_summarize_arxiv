    "the zero sets of modular forms have attracted much attention over the years . in an influential paper ,",
    "f. rankin and swinnerton - dyer @xcite showed that the zeros of the weight @xmath0 eisenstein series @xmath1 that lie in the standard fundamental domain lie on the circle @xmath2 .",
    "in sharp contrast , rudnick @xcite showed the zeros of hecke cusp forms become equidistributed in the fundamental domain as the weight becomes large , conditionally on the mass equidistribution conjecture which has since been proven by holowinsky and soundararajan @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of other results on zeros of various types of modular forms ; see for example @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in all of these cases",
    ", one observes a dichotomy with the zeros either being patterned ( say , with all zeros lying on some lower - dimensional set ) , or equidistributed in some larger space ( which one could view as randomness ) .",
    "one naturally wonders about the location of zeros of the derivative of a modular form ( which is not a modular form , but instead is a so - called quasimodular form ) .",
    "in contrast to the modular case , the zero set of a quasimodular form is not well - defined on @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the relevant congruence subgroup ) .",
    "this complicates matters , because there may be infinite sequences of zeros approaching the boundary of the upper half plane ",
    "there is no reduction theory that maps the zeros back to a fundamental domain for @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a fairly comprehensive description of the zero set of the weight @xmath6 eisenstein series @xmath7 defined by the fourier expansion @xmath8 it is known that @xmath9 ( following from the product formula for @xmath10 ) , so the zeros of @xmath11 in @xmath12 agree with the zeros of @xmath13 .",
    "el basraoui and sebbar @xcite have shown that the weight @xmath6 eisenstein series has infinitely many @xmath14-inequivalent zeros within the strip @xmath15 .",
    "this was generalized to other quasimodular forms by saber and sebbar @xcite ; also see balasubramanian and gun @xcite for some related results .",
    "el basraoui and sebbar @xcite have also identified certain infinite families of translates of the standard fundamental domain that all contain ( or do not contain , respectively ) a zero of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the closure of the standard fundamental domain , i.e. , @xmath17 the weight @xmath18 ( even ) eisenstein series for @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the stabilizer of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 if @xmath24 .",
    "it has the fourier expansion @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the @xmath0th bernoulli number , and @xmath28 . for @xmath29 , the sum in does not converge absolutely , consistent with the fact that there are no non - zero modular forms of weight @xmath6 for @xmath14 . when @xmath29 , the function @xmath7 defined by is a quasimodular form , which satisfies the relation @xmath30 see zagier s chapter @xcite for a proof of the transformation property of @xmath11 , as well as a general definition of a quasimodular form .",
    "note that @xmath11 is periodic with period @xmath31 , and for this reason we typically restrict attention to the strip @xmath32 .",
    "we used mathematica to numerically solve the equation @xmath33 for @xmath34 for various values of @xmath35 , using a truncated fourier expansion to approximate @xmath7 . this requires more than @xmath36 terms in the fourier expansion , so this becomes unwieldly for very small @xmath37 . for reasons that will be clear momentarily , it is natural to order the zeros by decreasing @xmath38-values .",
    "figure [ fig : listplotofzeros ] shows some zeros computed by mathematica .     for @xmath39,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the highest zero say @xmath40 occurs at @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to show that there exists a unique zero on the line @xmath41 because @xmath43 is real , increasing for @xmath44 , and has limits @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "there is also a zero say @xmath47 at @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we now briefly prove that there indeed exists a zero with @xmath50 , following @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the fourier expansion that @xmath51 is real .",
    "next let @xmath52 , so for @xmath53 , @xmath54 taking @xmath55 , the right hand side is @xmath56 , which has the limit @xmath57 . on the other hand , @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath59 has a zero for @xmath60 by the intermediate value theorem .",
    "this type of method to show existence of zeros on certain vertical lines only works on @xmath41 and @xmath61 since @xmath62 is real - valued only on these lines . since the fourier coefficients of @xmath11 are real - valued , if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 , so we shall sometimes only display the zeros with @xmath65 .",
    "the next few approximate zeros with @xmath66 produced by mathematica are : @xmath67 one immediately notices the striking fact that the @xmath68-coordinates of the zeros are quite close ( but not equal ) to the rational numbers @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    ". the @xmath38-coordinates also have a pattern : @xmath73 which are all close ( but not equal ) to squares of integers .",
    "needless to say , the data suggest that these patterns continue indefinitely .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to explain these patterns .",
    "we have    [ thm : zeroapprox ] let @xmath74 $ ] be a rational number with @xmath75 , and set @xmath76 for each such rational number , there exists a zero @xmath77 of @xmath11 satisfying @xmath78    for ease of comparison , we have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc . , which explains the numerical patterns noticed above .",
    "furthermore , the points @xmath85 with @xmath86 fixed and varying @xmath87 lie on the parabola @xmath88 , which explains the apparent families of curves appearing in figure [ fig : listplotofzeros ] .    in theorem [ thm : locationofzeros ] below we show in a more precise sense that the zeros of @xmath11 are naturally in one - to - one correspondence with the rational numbers .",
    "after writing this paper , we learned that imamoglu , jermann , and tth @xcite simultaneously and independently have obtained results substantially the same as our theorem [ thm : zeroapprox ] .",
    "our main tool for understanding the zeros of @xmath11 is an auxiliary function @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 this function @xmath89 is _ equivariant _ , which means that if @xmath91 and @xmath92 , then @xmath93 see sebbar - sebbar @xcite for some properties of @xmath94 , especially their theorem 5.3 which proves .",
    "note that @xmath95 is equivalent to @xmath96 .",
    "el basraoui and sebbar @xcite originally used properties of @xmath97 to show that @xmath7 has infinitely many @xmath4-inequivalent zeros in the strip @xmath98 .",
