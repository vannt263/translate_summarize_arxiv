    "the physical mechanism by which galaxies acquire their angular momentum is an important problem that has been the subject of investigation for nearly sixty years ( hoyle 1949 ) .",
    "this reflects the fundamental role played by angular momentum of galactic material in defining the size and shapes of galaxies ( e.g. fall & efstathiou 1981 ) . yet despite its physical significance , a precise and accurate understanding of the origin of galactic angular momentum remains one of the missing pieces in the galaxy formation puzzle .",
    "a fundamental assumption in current galaxy formation models is that galaxies form when gas cools and condenses within the potential wells of dark matter halos ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "consequently it is probable that the angular momentum of the galaxy will be linked to the angular momentum of its dark matter halo ( e.g. fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; zavala , okamoto & frenk 2007 ) . within the context of hierarchical structure formation models , the angular momentum growth of a dark matter proto - halo",
    "is driven by gravitational tidal torquing during the early stages ( i.e. the linear regime ) of its assembly .",
    "this `` tidal torque theory '' has been explored in detail ; it is a well - developed analytic theory ( e.g. peebles 1969 , doroshkevich 1979 , white 1984 ) and its predictions are in good agreement with the results of cosmological @xmath3-body simulations ( e.g. barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; warren  et  al .",
    "1992 ; sugerman , summers & kamionkowski 2000 ; porciani , dekel & hoffman 2002 ) . however , once the proto - halo has passed through maximum expansion and the collapse has become non - linear , tidal torquing no longer provides an adequate description of the evolution of the angular momentum ( white 1984 ) , which tends to decrease with time . during this phase",
    "it is likely that merger and accretion events play an increasingly important role in determining both the magnitude and direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy ( e.g. bailin & steinmetz 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , a number of studies have argued that mergers and accretion events are the primary determinants of the angular momenta of galaxies at the present day ( gardner 2001 ; maller , dekel  & somerville 2002 ; vitvitska  et  al .  2002 ) .",
    "it is common practice to quantify the angular momentum of a dark matter halo by the dimensionless `` classical '' spin parameter ( peebles 1969 ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnitude of the angular momentum of material within the virial radius , @xmath0 is the virial mass , and @xmath6 is the total energy of the system .",
    "it has been shown that halos that have suffered a recent major merger will tend to have a higher spin parameter @xmath1 than the average ( e.g. hetznecker & burkert 2006 ; power , knebe & knollmann 2008 ) .",
    "therefore one could argue that within the framework of hierarchical structure formation that higher mass halos should have larger spin parameters _ on average _ than less massive systems because they have assembled a larger fraction of their mass ( by merging ) more recently .",
    "however , if we consider only halos in virial equilibrium , should we expect to see a correlation between halo mass and spin ?",
    "one might navely expect that more massive systems will have had their maximum expansion more recently and so these systems will have been tidally torqued for longer than systems that had their maximum expansion at earlier times .",
    "this suggests that spin should _ increase _ with timing of maximum expansion and therefore halo mass .",
    "however , one finds at best a weak correlation between mass and spin for equilibrium halos at @xmath7=0 ( e.g. cole  & lacey 1996 ; bett et al . 2007 ) , and the correlation is for spin to _ decrease _ with increasing halo mass , contrary to our nave expectation .",
    "for the simulations presented here we have adopted the cosmology as given by spergel  et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11km / sec / mpc ) .",
    "each run employed @xmath12 particles and differed in simulation box - size @xmath13 , which leads to the particle mass @xmath14 differing between runs ",
    "@xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to probe a range of halo masses at redshift @xmath7=10 .",
    "halos in all runs have been identified using the mpi version of the ` ahf ` halo finder ( ` amiga`s - halo - finder ) , which is based on the ` mhf ` halo finder of gill , knebe & gibson ( 2004 ) . because we wish to examine the spin distribution of equilibrium halos , it is important to account for unrelaxed systems when investigating correlations between spin and halo mass .",
    "for an eloborate discussion of our relaxation criterion as well as more details about the simulations and halos we refer the reader to the original paper ( knebe  & power 2008 ) .",
    "while in knebe  & power ( 2008 ) we used the spin - parameter @xmath17 as defined by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we show results in this contribution based upon the classical spin - parameter definition as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "therefore , the work presented here can be seen complemetary to the original study of knebe  & power ( 2008 ) and confirms that the findings are independent of the spin - parameter definition .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spinmass ] , we investigate the correlation between halo spin @xmath1 and mass @xmath0 .",
    "the best fitting power - laws to these histograms reveal that @xmath18 with    @xmath19    this indicates that there is a _ weak _ correlation at high redshifts for spin to decrease with increasing mass , albeit stronger than the one at @xmath7=1 .",
    "[ fig : spinmass ]   with mass @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   with mass @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have performed an investigation of the relation between virial mass and dimensionless spin parameter for dark matter halos forming at high redshifts @xmath2 in a @xmath20cdm cosmology .",
    "the result of our study , which is based on a series of cosmological @xmath3-body simulations in which box size was varied while keeping particle number fixed , indicates that there is a _ weak _ correlation between mass and spin at @xmath7=10 , such that the spin decreases with increasing mass .",
    "if there is a correlation at @xmath7=1 , we argue that it is significantly weaker than the one we find at @xmath7=10 ; this is in qualitative agreement with the findings of previous studies that focused on lower redshifts ( maccio  et  al .",
    "2007 , shaw  et  al .  2005 ,",
    "lemson  & kauffmann 1999 ) .    while we presented such a correlation in a previous study ( knebe  & power 2008 ) using the bullock et al .",
