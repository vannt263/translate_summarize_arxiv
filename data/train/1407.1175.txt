    "the fir ( far infra red ) _ planck _ astronomical observatory was launched in 2009 and delivered , in 2011 , a treasure trove of fir galactic emission data ( tauber et al . 2010 , planck collaboration 2011 ) .",
    "it has observed the sky in a wide frequency range , from the cosmic microwave band to the fir with high sensitivity and angular resolution . in particular ,",
    "the bolometers of its high frequency instrument , cooled to 0.1 k , cover the 100 , 143 , 217 , 353 , 535 and 857 ghz bands .",
    "they delivered exquisitely detailed and accurate measures of electro - magnetic emission from the diffuse galactic interstellar medium ( dgism ) at high latitudes , which allowed the probing of the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the thermal emission of large dust grains that make up a sizable fraction of the interstellar ( is ) dust mass .",
    "these results complement and support previous space missions which contributed considerably to the same field , such as the infra red astronomical satellite ( iras ) and the cosmic background explorer ( cobe / firas ) .",
    "analyses of these measurements were made by boulanger et al .",
    "@xcite , abergel et al .",
    "@xcite and compigne at al .",
    "@xcite , who established that the average thermal spectrum of thin , quiescent clouds in the local dgism could be fitted by a gray - body spectrum at a temperature in the range 17 - 19 k. this spectrum , therefore , essentially covers the range from 100 to 1000 @xmath0 m .",
    "the search for possible dust carriers of is emission usually centers on graphite , or `` astronomical graphite and amorphous silicate''(draine and lee 1984 ) .",
    "an example of more recent models of the latter is that of compigne at al .",
    "this model includes bare silicate grains , pahs and `` amorphous carbon dust '' ( see their table 2 ) . for the latter , the authors used refractive indexes derived by zubko et al .",
    "@xcite for a be sample .",
    "this term designates a powder obtained by striking an electric arc from graphitic electrodes in an atmosphere of benzene or hydrogen , and was coined by koike et al .",
    "@xcite , who qualified the material as amorphous carbon . the latter appellation may be slightly confusing because , as a matter of fact , the grains making up the deposited powder were shown to consist of _ randomly _ dispersed _ crystallites _ , which electron microscopy shows are _ ordered _ like graphite ( see koike et al .",
    "1994 ) , and not microscopically amorphous ( like , for instance , hac , hydrogenated carbon ) .",
    "unfortunately , subsequent authors who used the zubko model sometimes also insisted that they rejected graphite in favor of hac ( see compigne et al .",
    "2011 , p. 4 )",
    ".    this might give the impression that graphite _ per se _ is no longer of use to astrophysics .",
    "witness to the opposite is the wide use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) , when it is considered that very small particles of graphite are essentially dehydrogenated pahs ( zubko et al .",
    "even the latest model of draine and li @xcite includes graphite with properties from draine and lee @xcite .",
    "besides , we ourselves recently showed the relevance of small imperfect / impure graphitic grains ( carrying a minority of the available carbon atoms ) to the modeling of the 2175   features and its variations ( papoular et al .",
    "thus , a full assessment of the role of graphite in astrophysics still requires some discussion .",
    "the development of efficient techniques for the production of pure graphene layers ( geim and novoselov 2007 ) and the subsequent demonstration of their exotic electrical behavior ( see castro - neto et al .",
    "2009 ) have spurred , in the technology community , a renewed interest in graphite , which is made of stacked graphene layers according to a definite geometrical rule ( bernal aba stacking ) .",
    "this led kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite to measure the reflectance of graphite at normal incidence , from about 1.8 to 300 @xmath0 m , and at 30 temperatures between 10 k and ambient .",
    "they also used ellipsometry to complement these measurements down to 0.3 @xmath0 m . during the past decade",
    ", great strides were made in the theoretical understanding of electron transport in graphene and graphite ( see , for instance , castro - neto et al . 2009 , falkovsky and varlamov 2007 , katsnelson and collegues : yuan et al .",
    "2011a , b and included bibliography ) .",
    "this is all of great help for our present purposes .",
    "now , of course , several measurements of graphite electrical properties were conducted since hoyle and wickramasinghe proposed this material as a major component of interstellar ( is ) dust ( see wickramasinghe 1967 ) .",
    "these are technically difficult measurements , especially for the edge - on orientation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "even face - on ( in - plane ) measurements have proved so challenging , especially in the fir , that the results obtained by different authors rarely converge . here , we compare some of these in an attempt to try and understand the causes of such discrepancies .",
    "we pay particular attention to philipp s work @xcite , which has been the basis of most astronomical uses of graphite as a model grain material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reports the measurements by kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite and their interpretation in the light of recent theories of graphene , with particular attention to temperature effects .",
    "section 3 describes the original procedure used here to obtain a physically sensible continuation of those measurements into the fir , beyond 10@xmath3 m .",
    "section 4 illustrates the essential optical properties delivered by our treatment : dielectric functions , refractive indexes , and complex reflectance for 4 typical temperatures .",
    "section 5 compares our absorption efficiency ( q / a ) for graphite at 300 k with those of previous authors , identifies the discrepancies between different published results and discusses their possible origins .",
    "section 6 finally briefly discusses the relevance of graphite to the modeling of fir and millimetric is emission , as compared to other models .",
    "an essential basis of our work is the data measured or deduced by kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite , in the form of files kindly provided by a. kuzmenko , for the normal incidence reflectance , @xmath4 , in - plane conductivity , @xmath5 and real part of the dielectric function , @xmath6 . the graphical representation of these is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rkuz ] , [ fig : e1kuz ] and [ fig : sigmakuz ] , where , for clarity , only 4 typical temperatures , 10 , 100 , 200 and 300 k , were retained from the 30 that were given .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function , @xmath7 , is derived from the conductivity by ( see bohren and huffman 1983 )    @xmath8    from this , one can derive the refraction indexes @xmath9 , the reflectance phase @xmath10 , the absorbance @xmath11 , and the absorption / extinction efficiency of small grains of radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( see bohren and huffman 1983 ) .    next , fig .",
    "[ fig : rphil77 ] pinpoints one of the primary motivations of this work , to wit the differences between the reflectance of kuzmenko et al . @xcite and those of taft and philipp @xcite , and philipp @xcite , all at room temperature .",
    "clearly , the dielectric functions beyond about 20 @xmath0 m can not agree .",
    "it must be remembered that philipp s extrapolation beyond 40 @xmath0 m was based not on his own measurements , but on previous measurements and analysis by sato @xcite .",
    "the leveling off at @xmath14 , followed by philipp s drude continuation to longer wavelengths , is the cause of a dramatic dip / peak in the dielectric functions , which reverberated strongly in draine and lee s  astronomical graphite \" @xcite .",
    "the current graphite measurements and theories predict quite a different behavior beyond 10 @xmath0 m , as shown below .",
    "absent experimental results beyond 200 @xmath0 m , understanding the physics of electron transport in graphite is a prerequisite to a sensible continuation of the data of kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite into the far infrared .",
    "this is made far easier by the recent elucidation of the properties of graphene , as graphite is obtained by stacking single graphene layers on top of each other according to a definite scheme ( bernal s aba ) .    at 0 k ,",
    "the conductivity of _ graphene _ beyond the @xmath15 resonance , through to the fir , is constant and equal to @xmath16 ( see kuzmenko 2008 ) , where @xmath17 is the electron charge .",
    "remarkably , this expression does not depend on any structural parameter .",
    "it is a result of the conical shape ( as opposed to the usual parabolic shape ) of the valence and conductivity electronic bands of graphene in reciprocal space , near the dirac point k of its brillouin zone , where they meet at the common apex of the two opposite cones .    in _ graphite _ at 0 k , in first approximation",
    ", this translates into a constant conductivity    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the interlayer spacing .",
    "this expression , too , does not depend on any structural parameter other than @xmath20 .",
    "however , electron hopping between the constitutive monolayers of graphite introduces subtle changes in the of electronic bands in reciprocal space , giving rise to a  self - doped material \" ( see kuzmenko 2008 ) . as a consequence , graphite at 0 k displays only roughly constant conductivity and then only in a limited spectral range ( 1 to 100 @xmath0 m , designated below as the  intermediate plateau \" ) . in this range ,",
    "figure [ fig : sigmakuz ] , for t=10 k , indeed displays a segment with nearly constant ordinate , except for two weak bumps discussed in more details by kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite , but overlooked here . obviously , the rising segment on the left is the red wing of the @xmath15 resonance which peaks near 4.1 ev or about 0.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "now , when the temperature rises above 0 k , both in graphene and graphite , more and more electrons are freed from the valence band into the conduction band , leaving behind an equal number of holes .",
    "the resulting increase in conductivity can be described analytically by a drude function ( see wallace 1947 , pedersen 2003 , falkovsky and varlamov 2007 ) , which rises to a  fir plateau \" , extending to dc , whose height increases with temperature .",
    "although this part of the fir conductivity is not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmakuz ] , it is apparent that the measurements reach a long way towards it , and this will be of great help for our present extrapolation purposes . note that the fir plateau is due to _ _ intra__band conductance , while the intermediate plateau , as well as the resonances , is due to _",
    "_ inter__band conductance .",
    "as the number of electrons * per cell * of the material is finite and constant ( f - sum rule ) , the increased optical weight in the fir must be exactly compensated by a decrease in the adjacent part of the conductivity plateau , as evidenced by dips below the average plateau in the same figure .",
    "an adequate continuation into the fir must account for both the increase and decrease of the conductivity ( in different but adjacent parts of the ir spectrum ) , as the temperature varies .    while the conductivity of _ graphene _ at 0 k is theoretically constant throughout the ir , another consequence of inter - layer hopping in _",
    "graphite _ is that the fir conductivity plateau ( beyond 1000 @xmath0 m ) is higher than the intermediate plateau ( roughly 1 to 100 @xmath0 m ) , even at 0 k , as suggested by the curve for t=10 k in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmakuz ] .",
    "the above indicates that a first step , in extrapolating the experimental results into the fir , is to use a drude function , as philipp @xcite did before : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency , @xmath23 the dielectric constant of vacuum , @xmath24 the plasma frequency and @xmath25 the dispersion constant or line width , physically associated with electron scattering .",
    "while @xmath24 obviously increases with temperature @xmath1 , @xmath25 may be a function of @xmath1 but should remain in the vicinity of 6 mev ( @xmath26 m ) , where the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmakuz ] all quickly rise",
    ".    however , one can not stay content with this . in order to account for the central plateau and its deformation",
    "as @xmath1 increases , we therefore added to the conductivity a  negative \" modified drude function @xmath27 where @xmath28 is identical with @xmath29 of eq . 2 and @xmath30",
    "may be a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this choice of function is empirical and devoid of physical meaning , but guided by the need for a function whose conjugate by the kramers - kronig transform is known .",
    "similarly , for the left part of fig . [ fig : sigmakuz ] , where the intermediate plateau must fade away into the @xmath15 resonance we represented it by the sum of the characteristic lorentzian of this resonance , @xmath31 and a  positive \" modified drude function    @xmath32    where @xmath33 need not vary with @xmath1 as all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmakuz ] merge together , independant of @xmath1 .",
    "the adjustable dimensionless parameter @xmath34 , common to both modified drude functions , defines the height of the plateau and its value should theoretically remain close to 1 .",
    "this choice of modeling functions allows one to promptly deduce the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions and , hence , all optical quantities of interest .",
    "it is then possible to tailor the parameters defining the 4 functions , so as to best fit the experimental results .",
    "the satisfactory fits obtained this way , as shown below , give confidence in this representation , at least for practical purposes , which has three benefits : first , one can dispense with the heavy burden , and attendant uncertainties at both ends of the spectral window considered , of applying the kramers - kronig relations to infer , for instance , the phase of the reflectivity from the measured reflectance , @xmath4 , so as to deduce the optical functions ; second , all 3 given sets of experimental data are simultaneously used to fit the measurements ; three , it is possible to define analytically the dielectric functions , once the temperature dependences of the parameters have been found ( empirically or theoretically ) .",
    "as explained above , all experimental optical properties of interest here can be deduced directly from any pair among the 3 quantities @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 for which kuzmenko et al .",
    "@xcite gave experimental data up to 200 @xmath0 m ; they are therefore all labeled below as  measured \" . for a given temperature , a fit of our model to any of the latter two delivers all other optical quantities . in effect",
    ", the fits were optimized by simultaneous comparison of experimental and model spectra of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the hope of compensating possible measurement uncertainties .",
    "the fits were then perfected by optimizing the parameters using non - linear least - squares minimization based on the davidon - fletcher - powell ( dfp ) method @xcite .",
    "the following figures illustrate the spectra delivered by the model ( dashes ) and superimposed upon the corresponding measured spectra ( dots ) , using black , blue , green and red colors for 10 , 100 , 200 and 300 k , respectively .",
    "table 1 collects the fit parameters for the 4 temperatures . in all cases , the best fit to the plateau",
    "was obtained by adjusting the value of c in the expressions for the  modified \" drude functions .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath15 lorentzian are very close to those adopted by papoular and papoular @xcite to fit the observed uv feature at 2175  .",
    "the fit parameters for all 30 temperatures measured by kuzmenko et al . are given in the appendix .",
