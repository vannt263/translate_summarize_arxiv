    "@xcite , the totally symmetric _ killing tensors _ and",
    "the skew symmetric _ killing  yano _ forms have played an important role for the developments of gravitational and mathematical physics ever since then . for example , they find a wide variety of applications in classical and quantum physics @xcite , play an important role for studying various integrability properties of ( higher - dimensional ) black holes @xcite , are related to special manifolds @xcite , or naturally appear in the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "since , contrary to killing vectors , killing and killing  yano tensors do not have clear geometrical meaning ",
    "they no longer describe continuous symmetries of the geometry but can rather be considered as ` symmetries of the phase space'they are sometimes called dynamical , or _",
    "hidden symmetries_.    the existence of hidden symmetries imposes strict restrictions on the background geometry , e.g. @xcite .",
    "consequently , not every manifold admits such symmetries .",
    "even if the symmetries are present , finding their form _ explicitly _ by solving the corresponding differential equations is a formidable task .",
    "for this reason , it is of extreme value to seek alternative ways for finding such symmetries .    in this paper",
    "we proceed in this direction .",
    "namely , we study hidden symmetries on _ warped spaces _ , formulating various criteria under which the killing  yano and killing tensors on the base space can be _ lifted _ to symmetries of the full warped geometry .",
    "( for a different type of lift , see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "this decomposes a task of finding such symmetries to a smaller problem ( that of finding hidden symmetries for a smaller seed metric ) and opens a way towards extending the applicability of hidden symmetries to more complicated spacetimes .",
    "the procedure is illustrated on several examples of physical interest , including rotating black strings , higher - dimensional singly spinning kerr - ads metrics , and the 5-dimensional eguchi  hanson soliton .",
    "we shall also consider a warped product of two kerr - nut-(a)ds geometries , constructing thus a _ new class _ of highly symmetric vacuum black hole solutions admitting towers of hidden symmetries lifted from the seed metrics .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the basic definitions of killing and killing  yano tensors . in sec .",
    "iii four theorems for lifting the seed symmetry to the full warped geometry are formulated .",
    "a concrete application of these theorems is illustrated for several examples in secs .",
    "iv and v. the results are summarized in sec .",
    "the appendices contain supplementary material : appendix  [ apx : proof ] is devoted to the proofs of the theorems , appendix  [ apx : onshellwarp ] contains additional material about the kerr - nut-(a)ds spaces and their warped product .",
    "let us briefly explain our notations . in what follows we try to avoid writing explicitly the tensor indices , highlighting the tensor character of objects by boldface .",
    "at the same time , we adopt a standard convention and do not distinguish tensors with covariant and contravariant indices  indices are automatically lowered or raised using the metric @xmath0 or the inverse metric @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the dot `` @xmath2 '' between two objects represents a ( one index ) contraction . for example , the divergence @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 .",
    "we shall also employ the symmetric and multiple contraction products .",
    "namely , operation``@xmath5 '' stands for the normalized _ symmetric _ tensor product , ( ) ^a_1  a_rb_1  b_s = ^(a_1  a_r^b_1  b_s ) .",
    "the _ multiple contraction _",
    ", `` @xmath6 '' , denotes the partial contraction of two antisymmetric forms in the first @xmath7 indices divided by @xmath8 , @xmath9 if no index @xmath7 is indicated , the full contraction in all indices is assumed . in terms of this operation",
    "we can also write down the _ hodge dual _ as @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the levi - civita tensor .      the @xmath12-form @xmath13 is a _ killing  yano ( ky ) _",
    "form @xcite if there exists a @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for any vector @xmath16 . the ` _ strength _ ' @xmath14 of the ky form is then uniquely determined as @xmath17 the @xmath18-form @xmath19 is a _ closed conformal killing - yano ( ccky ) form _ if there exists a @xmath20-form @xmath21 so that @xmath22 holds for an arbitrary vector @xmath23 .",
    "the strength @xmath21 is then given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "note that the notions of ky and ccky forms are hodge dual : the hodge dual @xmath26 of a ky form @xmath13 with the strength @xmath14 is a ccky form with the strength @xmath27 , and vice versa .    the _ killing tensor _",
    "@xmath28 of rank @xmath29 is a totally symmetric tensor satisfying @xmath30 the totally symmetric tensor @xmath31 is a _ conformal killing tensor ( ckt ) _ of rank @xmath7 if there exists a symmetric tensor @xmath32 of rank @xmath33 such that @xmath34 we say that the strength @xmath32 determines the symmetric derivative of ckt @xmath31 . it can be expressed in terms of the metric traces of @xmath35 .",
    "for example , for a rank 2 ckt it reads @xmath36 if @xmath32 is exact , @xmath37 , the ckt @xmath31 defines a killing tensor @xmath38 according to @xcite @xmath39    partially contracted squares of ky and ccky forms generate killing tensors and ckts of rank 2 , respectively .",
    "namely , a ky form @xmath40 of rank @xmath41 defines a second rank killing tensor @xmath42 similarly , a rank @xmath41 ccky form @xmath19 defines a ckt @xmath43 for the hodge dual forms @xmath44 these tensors are related by , where @xmath45",
    "the warped space @xmath46 can be realized as a direct product @xmath47 of two manifolds of arbitrary dimensions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with the metric @xmath50 metrics @xmath51 and @xmath52 are called the base ( seed ) metrics and @xmath53 is the warp factor .",
    "the levi - civita tensor has the form @xmath54 if not said otherwise , we assume that tilded objects @xmath55 are non - trivial only in `` tilded directions '' and , similarly , barred objects @xmath56 only in `` barred directions '' .",
    "the orthogonal splitting of the tangent tensor spaces @xmath57 is well defined thanks to the diagonal character of the metric . also ,",
    "if not said otherwise , the tilded and barred objects will depend only on a position in @xmath58 or @xmath59 , respectively .",

    "similarly , let @xmath76 be a ccky of @xmath70 and the the warp factor satisfies @xmath77 then the following @xmath18-form : @xmath78 is a ccky form of the metric .",
    "_    the conditions and can be written in a different form . using the leibnitz rule",
    ", we find @xmath79 where the closed 1-form @xmath80 is defined in .",
    "employing the ky and ccky strengths and , respectively , one obtains @xmath81 the conditions are equivalent under the hodge duality @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "* theorem 4 . *",

    "however , the theorems in these pairs are not equivalent or the latter is not a corollary of the former , since the existence of a killing tensor ( or a ckt ) not necessarily requires the existence of its ky ( ccky ) `` square root '' .",
    "as a first simple example , let us consider a _ rotating black string _ in five dimensions .",
    "the metric takes the form , with a trivial warp factor @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath52 given by the kerr geometry , [ kerr ] & = & -^2 + r^2 + ^2 ^2 + & + & ^2 , where & = & r^2+a^2 - 2mr,^2 = r^2+a^2 ^ 2 .",

    ", this immediately lifts to the ky 2-form @xmath94 of the black string in five dimensions .    as a second non - trivial example , let us consider the _ singly - spinning kerr - ads _",
    "metric in @xmath95 number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "this metric can be written in the form , where , in the standard boyer ",
    "lindquist coordinates , we have & = & -^2 + r^2 + ^2 + & + & ^2 , + & = & _ d-4 ^ 2,^2=r^2 ^2 , and & = & ( r^2+a^2)(1 + ) - 2mr^5-d , = 1-^2 , + & = & 1- , ^2 = r^2+a^2 ^ 2 .",
    "it is known , e.g. @xcite , that @xmath51 admits a non - trivial ccky 2-form , given by @xmath96 , where 2=(r^2+a^2 ^ 2)t-^2(a^2+r^2 ) .",
    "one can easily verify the validity of condition .",
    "the theorem 3 then implies that @xmath97 is a ccky 2-form of the full @xmath95-dimensional kerr - ads geometry .",
    "finally , consider the five - dimensional _ eguchi  hanson soliton _ @xcite .",
    "the metric writes as , with & = & -^2 + + ( r^2+n^2)_2 ^ 2 , + & = & z^2,^2=r^2,=,and @xmath98 .",
    "the metric @xmath51 admits a non - trivial ccky 2-form , given by @xmath96 , where @xcite 2=r^2t+2n(r^2+n^2 ) ( ) .",
    "again , one can easily check the condition .",
    "the theorem 3 then implies that @xmath97 is a ccky 2-form of the full 5-dimensional eguchi  hanson soliton .",
    "a prominent example of a geometry with more than one hidden symmetry is the general kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetime @xcite . in an even dimension , @xmath99",

    "the metric is _ on - shell _ , that is , it obeys the vacuum einstein equations with the cosmological constant @xmath105 , provided the metric functions @xmath106 take the following special polynomial form : @xmath107 in particular , for a black hole solution ( provided proper ranges and wick rotations of coordinates are chosen and some relations between parameters are satisfied ) , parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 are related to rotations , while parameters @xmath110 are related to mass , nut and twist charges , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "interestingly , irrespective of the metric signature or field equations , for any metric functions of the form x_=x_(x _ ) , the so called _ off - shell _ metric admits a rich structure of hidden symmetries .",
    "these symmetries can be generated from the _ principal ccky tensor @xmath111 _ , given by @xcite @xmath112 in particular , we find the towers of symmetries summarized in the following table @xcite : [ a1 ]     & = 1j ! ^j + & = + &   =   + & = +    forms and tensors in this tower are defined for @xmath113 , however , for some values of   @xmath114 , they are trivial .",
    "namely , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "note also that the the killing tensors are related to the ckts by @xcite @xmath123 reflecting the fact that the strengths of ckts are given by [ sigmajj ] _ ( j ) = ^-1 .",
    "let us now construct an example of a _ new warped geometry _ where the two bases @xmath70 and @xmath62 are the off - shell kerr - nut-(a)ds geometries of dimension @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , while we choose the following warp factor : @xmath126 obviously , such a warped space is not an off - shell kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "however , as we shall see , it shares some important properties with the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "namely , it possesses the tower of hidden symmetries , that can be obtained by lifting the symmetries of the two seed metrics using theorems 14 .",
    "moreover , as shown in appendix  [ warpedonshell ] the warped geometry solves the vacuum einstein equations with the cosmological constant @xmath127 , provided we set @xmath128 with @xmath129 we note that the barred metric itself is an on - shell kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "however , the tilded metric has modified metric functions , with the exponent of @xmath130 in depending on the dimension of the barred part .",
    "in particular , we observe that for a two - dimensional lorentzian metric @xmath51 and vanishing parameters @xmath131 the warped space reduces to the spherical schwarzschild ",
    "tangherlini black hole in the dimension @xmath132 .",
    "let us now turn to the lift of the hidden symmetries .",
    "as always , the results are valid for the off - shell warped metric , for arbitrary @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we start from the metric @xmath70 . to implement the lifting construction given by theorems 3 and 4 , we need to demonstrate that the warp factor and the forms @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and the ckts @xmath137 satisfy the conditions , , and , respectively .",
    "we do so in appendix  [ constcond ] .",
    "the theorems then imply that the warp geometry inherits the following ky forms , ccky forms , and ckts : @xmath138 note that ckts could be obtained as a square of , according to .",
    "similarly , taking square of we can define killing tensors @xmath139 . with the help of and",
    "they read @xmath140 the killing tensors and ckts satisfy with @xmath141 which , in this case , reads @xmath142    turning next to the metric @xmath62 , the theorem  1 immediately implies that the warped space inherits the following rank @xmath143 ky forms @xmath144 and rank @xmath145 ccky forms @xmath146 : & = & ^2()+1 , [ ky - kyb ] + & = & ^21 , [ ccky - cckyb ] while the theorem  2 guarantees the following killing tensors : @xmath147 that could be also obtained by taking the square of @xmath148 .",
    "similarly , by squaring @xmath149 , , according to , we can construct the following ckts : @xmath150 killing tensors and ckts are related by with @xmath151 defined by , @xmath152 however , since the warped space is not the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry , instead of we have , @xmath153    this concludes the lift of all hidden symmetries of the two kerr - nut-(a)ds spaces .",
    "we thus constructed the full symmetry tower for the warped space given by the product of two kerr - nut-(a)ds metrics with the warped factor , cf .",
    "the symmetry tower of kerr - nut-(a)ds in @xmath154 dimensions .",
    "namely , we have obtained ky and ccky forms @xmath155 and @xmath156 , killing tensors @xmath157 , and ckts @xmath158 for @xmath113 , @xmath159 . and barred objects with @xmath160 gives the same killing objects on the warped space with @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , @xmath162 values of index @xmath114 is consistent with @xmath163 values of index  @xmath164 and @xmath165 values of index  @xmath166 . ]",
    "since the warped space does not directly belong to the kerr - nut-(a)ds class , the same degree of symmetry may be surprising .",
    "the reason for this is discussed in @xcite , where the warped spaces are obtained as a particular limit of the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "hidden symmetries associated with the killing  yano and killing tensors play an important role in modern gravitational and mathematical physics .",
    "for example , such symmetries provide a powerful tool for studying various integrability properties of higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "however , to show their presence or , even more importantly , to find such symmetries explicitly for a given metric is not a straightforward task .    in this paper",
    "we have studied a ` warping construction ' that will allow one to generate hidden symmetries of complicated spacetimes , starting from the symmetries of more simple ones .",
    "namely , we have formulated four theorems discussing the conditions under which a hidden symmetry of the base space can be lifted to the symmetry of the full warped geometry .",
    "we illustrated the procedure on several examples , providing new prototypes of spacetimes admitting hidden symmetries .",
    "in particular , we have constructed a new class of vacuum black hole solutions that admit the ` same ' tower of hidden symmetries as the general kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetime .",
    "a generalization to a wider class of metrics is under investigation @xcite .",
    "further generalizations of this construction as well as its applications to finding new examples of physically interesting spacetimes with hidden symmetries are left for future studies .",

    "<S> we formulate several criteria under which the symmetries associated with the killing and killing  yano tensors on the base space can be lifted to the symmetries of the full warped geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is explicitly illustrated on several examples , providing new prototypes of spacetimes admitting such tensors . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study a warped product of two kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetimes and show that it gives rise to a new class of highly symmetric vacuum ( with cosmological constant ) black hole solutions that inherit many of the properties of the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry . </S>"
