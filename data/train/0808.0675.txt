    "when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , besides and at the same time with the quantum decoherence phenomenon , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems @xcite . in certain circumstances , the environment enhances the entanglement and in others it suppresses the entanglement and the state describing the two systems becomes separable .",
    "the structure of the environment may be such that not only the two systems become entangled , but also such that the entanglement is maintained for a definite time or a certain amount of entanglement survives in the asymptotic long - time regime .    in the present paper we investigate , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the existence of the continuous variable asymptotic entanglement for a subsystem composed of two identical harmonic oscillators interacting with an environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two systems are independent , i.e. they do not interact directly .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state .",
    "we only investigate here the asymptotic behaviour of the subsystem states .",
    "the time evolution of the entanglement , in particular the possibility of the so - called `` entanglement sudden death '' , that is suppression of the entanglement at a certain finite moment of time , will be discussed in a future work .    the organizing of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we write the equations of motion in the heisenberg picture for two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment . with these equations",
    "we derive in sec .",
    "3 the asymptotic values of variances and covariances of coordinates and momenta which enter the asymptotic covariance matrix . then , by using the peres - simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two - mode gaussian states @xcite , we investigate the behaviour of the environment induced entanglement in the limit of long times . we show that for certain classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is entangled , while for other values of the parameters describing the environment , the entanglement is suppressed and the asymptotic state is separable .",
    "the existence of the quantum correlations between the two systems in the asymptotic long - time regime is the result of the competition between entanglement and quantum decoherence .",
