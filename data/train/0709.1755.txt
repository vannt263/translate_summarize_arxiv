    "the field of chemical physics is full of phenomena that occur quantum mechanically , with observable consequences , despite being forbidden by classical mechanics@xcite .",
    "all such processes are labeled as tunneling with the standard elementary example being that of a particle surmounting a potential barrier despite insufficient energy .",
    "however the notion of tunneling is far more general in the sense that the barriers can arise in the phase space@xcite . in other words",
    "the barriers are dynamical and arise due to the existence of one or several conserved quantities . barriers due to exactly conserved quantities _",
    "i.e. , _ constants of the motion are usually easy to identify .",
    "a special case is that of a particle in a one dimensional double well potential wherein the barrier is purely due to the conserved energy . on the other hand it is possible , and frequently observed , that the dynamics of the system can result in one or more approximate constants of the motion which can manifest as barriers .",
    "the term approximate refers to the fact that the relevant quantities , although strictly nonconserved , are constant over timescales that are long compared to certain system timescales of interest@xcite .",
    "such approximate dynamical barriers are not easy to identify and in combination with the other exact constants of the motion can give rise to fairly complex dynamics . as usual one anticipates that the dynamical barriers will act as bottlenecks for the classical dynamics whereas quantum dynamics will ` break free ' due to tunneling through the dynamical barriers _",
    "i.e. , _ _ dynamical tunneling_. however , as emphasized in this review , the situation is not necessarily that straightforward since the mere existence of a finite dynamical barrier does not guarantee that dynamical tunneling will occur .",
    "this is especially true in multidimensions since a variety of other dynamical effects can localize the quantum dynamics . in this sense",
    "the mechanism of dynamical tunneling is far more subtle as compared to the mechanism of tunneling through nondynamical barriers .",
    "the distinction between energetic and dynamical barriers can be illustrated by considering the two - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath0 which represents a one - dimensional double well ( in the @xmath1 degree of freedom ) coupled to a harmonic oscillator ( in the @xmath2 degree of freedom ) . for energies @xmath3 below the barrier height @xmath4 , the @xmath5 poincar surface of section in fig .",

    "one can have , for instance , vibrational excitations transferring from a particular mode of a molecule to a completely different mode@xcite .",

    "this review is concerned with the molecular manifestations of dynamical tunneling and specifically on the relevance of dynamical tunneling to ivr and the corresponding signatures in molecular spectra .",
    "one of the aims is to reveal the detailed phase space description of dynamical tunneling .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the identification of the key structures in phase space and a universal mechanism for dynamical tunneling in all of the systems mentioned above .    in ivr studies , which is of paramount interest to chemical dynamics ,",
    "one is interested in the fate of an initial nonstationary excitation in terms of timescales , pathways and destinations@xcite .",
    "will the initial energy `` hot - spot '' redistribute throughout the molecule statistically ?",
    "alternatively , to borrow a term from a recent review@xcite , is the observed statisticality only `` skin - deep '' ?",
    "the former viewpoint is at the heart of one of the most useful theories for reaction rates - the rrkm ( rice - rampsperger - kassel- marcus ) theory@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies@xcite seem to be leaning more towards the latter viewpoint . as an aside it is worth mentioning",
    "that ivr in molecules is essentially the fpu@xcite ( fermi - pasta - ulam ) problem ; only now one needs to worry about a multidimensional network of coupled nonlinear oscillators . in a broad sense",
    ", the hope is that a mechanistic understanding of ivr will yield important insights into mode - specific chemistry and the coherent control of reactions .",
    "consequently , substantial experimental@xcite and theoretical efforts@xcite have been directed towards understanding ivr in both time and frequency domains .",
    "most of the studies , spanning many decades , have focused on the gas phase .",
    "more recently , researchers have studied ivr in the condensed phase and it appears that the gas phase studies provide a useful starting point .",
    "a detailed introduction to the literature on ivr is beyond the scope of the current article .",
    "a brief description is provided in the next section and the reader is refered to the literature below for a comprehensive account of the recent advances .",
    "the review@xcite by nesbitt and field gives an excellent introduction to the literature .",
    "the review@xcite by gruebele highlights the recent advances and the possibility of controlling ivr .",
    "the topic of molecular energy flow in solutions has been recently reviewed@xcite by a\"smann , kling and abel .",
    "tunneling leads to quantum mixing between states localized in classically disconnected regions of the phase space . in this",
    "general setting barriers arise due to exactly or even approximately conserved quantities .",
    "thus , for example , it is possible for two or more localized quantum states to mix with each other despite the absence of any energetic barriers separating them .",
    "this has significant consequences for ivr in isolated molecules@xcite since energy can flow from an initially excited mode to other , qualitatively different , modes ; classically one would predict very little to no energy flow .",
    "hence it is appropriate to associate dynamical tunneling with a purely quantum mechanism for energy flow in molecules . in order to have detailed insights into ivr pathways and rates",
    "it is necessary to study both the classical and quantum routes .",
    "the division is artificial since both mechanisms coexist and compete with each other .",
    "however , from the standpoint of control of ivr deciding the importance of one route over the other can be useful .",
    "in molecular systems the dynamical barriers to ivr are related to the existence of the so called _ polyad numbers_@xcite .",
    "usually the polyad numbers are quasiconserved quantities and act as bottlenecks for energy flow between different polyads .",
    "dynamical tunneling , on the otherhand , could lead to interpolyad energy flow .",
    "historically the time scales for ivr via dynamical tunneling have been thought to be of the order of hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "however recent advances in our understanding of dynamical tunneling suggest that the timescales could be much smaller in the mixed phase space regimes .",
    "this is mainly due to the observations@xcite that chaos in the underlying phase space can enhance the tunneling by several orders of magnitude .",
    "conversely , very early on it was thought that the extremely long timescales would allow for mode - specific chemistry .",
    "presumably the chaotic enhancement would spoil the mode specificty and hence render the initially prepared state unstable .",
    "thus it is important to understand the effect of chaos on dynamical tunneling in order to suppress the enhancement .",
    "obtaining detailed insights into the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling and the resulting consequences for ivr requires us to address several questions .",
    "how does one identify the barriers ?",
    "can one explicitly construct the dynamical barriers for a given system ?",
    "what is the role of the various phase space structures like resonances , partial barriers due to broken separatrices and cantori , and chaos ?",
    "which , if any , of the phase space structures provide for a universal description and mechanism of dynamical tunneling ?",
    "finally the most important question : do experiments encode the sensitivity of dynamical tunneling to the nature of the phase space ?",
    "this review is concerned with addressing most of the questions posed above in a molecular context . due to the nature of the issues involved considerable",
    "work has been done by the nonlinear physics community and in this work some of the recent developements will be highlighted since they can have significant impact on the molecular systems as well .",
    "another reason for bringing together developements in different fields has to do with the observation that the literature on dynamical tunneling and its consequences are , curiuosly enough , disjoint with hardly any overlap between the molecular and the ` non ' molecular areas .    at this stage",
    "it is important and appropriate , given the viewpoint adopted in this review , to highlight certain crucial issues pertaining to the nature of the classical phase space for systems with several ( @xmath13 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "a significant portion of the present review is concerned with the phase space viewpoint of dynamical tunneling in systems with @xmath14 .",
    "the last section of the review discusses recent work on a model with three degrees of freedom .",
    "the sparsity of work in @xmath13 is not entirely surprising and parallels the situation that prevails in the classical - quantum correspondence studies of ivr in polyatomic molecules .",
    "indeed it will become clear from this review that classical phase space structures are , to a large extent , responsible for both classical and quantum mechanisms of ivr .",
    "thus , from a fundamental , and certainly from the molecular , standpoint it is highly desirable to understand the mechanism of classical phase space transport in systems with @xmath13 . in the early eighties the seminal work@xcite by mackay , meiss , and percival on transport in hamiltonian systems with @xmath15 motivated researchers in the chemical physics community to investigate the role of various phase space structures in ivr dynamics .",
    "in particular these studies@xcite helped in providing a deeper understanding of the dynamical origin of nonstatistical behaviour in molecules .",
    "however molecular systems typically have atleast @xmath16 and soon the need for a generalization to higher degrees of freedom was felt ; this task was quite difficult since the concept of transport across broken separatrices and cantori do not have a straightforward generalization in higher degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition tools like the poincar surface of section cease to be useful for visualizing the global phase space structures .",
    "wiggins@xcite provided one of the early generalizations based on the concept of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( nhim ) which led to illuminating studies@xcite in order to elucidate the dynamical nature of the intramolecular bottlenecks for @xmath13 .",
    "although useful insights were gained from several studies@xcite the intramolecular bottlenecks could not be characterized at the same levels of detail as in the two degree of freedom cases .",
    "it is not feasible to review the various studies and their relation / consequences to the topic of this article .",
    "the reader is referred to the paper@xcite by gillilan and ezra for an introduction and to the monograph@xcite by wiggins for an exposition to the theory of nhims . following the initial studies , which were perhaps ahead of their time ,",
    "far fewer efforts were made for almost a decade but there has been a renewal of interest in the problem over the last few years with the nhims playing a crucial role .",
    "armed with the understanding that the notion of partial barriers , chaos , and resonances are very different in @xmath13 fresh insights on transition state and rrkm theories , and hence ivr , are beginning to emerge@xcite .    to put the issues raised above in perspective for the current review note that there are barriers in phase space through which dynamical tunneling occurs and at the same time there are barriers that can also lead to the localization of the quantum dynamics .",
    "the competition between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization is already important for systems with @xmath15 and this will be briefly discussed in the later sections . towards the end of the review some work on a three degrees of freedom model are presented .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the ideas are necessarily preliminary since to date one does not have a detailed understanding of either the classical barriers to transport nor the dynamical barriers which result in dynamical tunneling .",
    "naturally , the competition between them is an open problem .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of ivr and the explicit connections to dynamical tunneling .",
    "consider a molecule with @xmath17 atoms which has @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for linear molecules ) vibrational modes .",
    "dynamical studies , classical and/or quantum , require the @xmath20-dimensional born - oppenheimer potential energy surface @xmath21 in terms of some convenient generalized coordinates @xmath22 and their choice is a crucial issue .",
    "obtaining the global @xmath23 by solving the schrdinger equation is a formidable task even for mid - sized molecules . traditionally , therefore , a perturbative viewpoint is adopted which has enjoyed a considerable degree of success .",
    "for example , near the bottom of the well and for low levels of excitations the approximation of vibrations by uncoupled harmonic normal modes is sufficient and the molecular vibrational hamiltonian can be expressed perturbatively as@xcite : @xmath24 in the above @xmath25 are the dimensionless vibrational momenta and normal mode coordinates respectively .",
    "the deviations from the harmonic limit are captured by the anharmonic terms with strengths @xmath26 .",
    "such small anharmonicities account for the relatively weak overtone and combination transitions observed in experimental spectra .",
    "however with increasing energy the anharmonic terms become important and doubts arise regarding the appropriateness of a perturbative approach .",
    "the low energy normal modes get coupled and the very concept of a mode becomes ambiguous .",
    "there exists sufficient evidence@xcite for the appearance of new ` modes ' , unrelated to the normal modes , with increasing vibrational excitations .",
    "nevertheless detailed theoretical studies over the last couple of decades has shown that it is still possible to understand the vibrational dynamics via a suitably generalized perturbative approach - the canonical van - vleck perturbation theory ( cvpt)@xcite . the cvpt leads to an effective or spectroscopic hamiltonian which can be written down as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the harmonic number , destruction and creation operators .",
    "the zeroth - order part _ i.e. , _ the dunham expansion@xcite @xmath30 is diagonal in the number representation . in the above expression @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the number of quanta in the j@xmath33 mode with degeneracy @xmath34 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms _",
    "i.e. , _ anharmonic resonances have the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",

    "nevertheless it is possible that vibrational superexchange can couple the first and second tiers and energy can eventually flow into the final tier ( grey ) over long timescales.,width=302 ]    a few key points regarding the effective hamiltonians can be noted at this juncture .",
    "there are two routes to the effective hamiltonians . in the cvpt method",
    "the parameters of the effective hamiltonian are related to the original molecular parameters of @xmath23 .",
    "the other route , given the difficulties associated with determining a sufficiently accurate @xmath23 , is _ via _ high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the parameters of eq.([specham ] ) are determined@xcite by fitting the experimental data on line positions and , to a lesser extent , intensities .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is only a model and hence the parameters of the effective hamiltonian do not have any obvious relationship to the molecular parameters of @xmath23 .",
    "although the two routes to eq.([specham ] ) are very different , they complement one another and each has its own advantages and drawbacks .",
    "the reader is refered to the reviews by sibert and joyeux for a detailed discussion of the cvpt approach .",
    "the review@xcite by ishikawa _",
    "et al . _ on the experimental and theoretical studies of the hcp @xmath42 cph isomerization dynamics provides , amongst other things , a detailed comparison between the two routes .",
    "imagine preparing a specific initial state , say an eigenstate of @xmath43 , denoted as @xmath44 .",
    "theoretically one is not restricted to @xmath44 and very general class of initial states can be considered",
    ". however , time domain experiments with short laser pulses excite specific vibrational overtone or combination states , called as the zeroth - order bright states ( zobs ) , which approximately correspond to the eigenstates of @xmath43 .",
    "the rest of the optically inaccessible states are called as dark states @xmath45 . here",
    "the zeroth - order eigenstates @xmath46 are partitioned as @xmath47 couple the bright state with the dark states leading to energy flow and impose a hierarchical coupling structure between the zobs and the dark states .",
    "thus one imagines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the dark states to be arranged in tiers , determined by the order @xmath48 of the @xmath49 , with an increasing density of states across the tiers .",
    "this implies that the the local density of states around @xmath50 is the important factor and experiments do point to a hierarchical ivr process@xcite .",
    "for example , callegari _ et al .",
    "_ have observed seven different time scales ranging from 100 femtoseconds to 2 nanoseconds for ivr out of the first ch stretch overtone of the benzene molecule@xcite .",
    "gruebele and coworkers have impressively modeled the ivr in many large molecules based on the hierarchical tiers concept@xcite . in a way the coupling @xmath51 imposes a tier structure on the ivr ;",
    "similar tiered ivr flow would have been observed if one had investigated the direct dynamics ensuing from the global @xmath23 .",
    "thus the cvpt and its classical analog help in unraveling the tier structure .",
    "nevertheless dominant classical and quantum energy flow routes still have to be identified for detailed mechanistic insights .    in the time domain",
    "the survival probability @xmath52 gives important information on the ivr process .",
    "the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian have been denoted by @xmath53 being the spectral intensities .",
    "the long time average of @xmath54 @xmath55 is known as the inverse participation ratio ( also called as the dilution factor in the spectroscopic community ) .",
    "essentially @xmath56 indicates the number of states that participate in the ivr dynamics out of @xmath57 .",
    "[ htbp ]     to states on the energy shell .",
    "examples of such one - step and multistep superexchange paths in the state space are shown.,width=321 ]    although the tier picture has proved to be useful in analysing ivr , recent studies@xcite emphasize the far greater utility in visualising the ivr dynamics of @xmath58 as a diffusion in the zeroth - order quantum number space or _ state space _ denoted by @xmath59 . the state space picture , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , highlights the local nature and the directionality of the energy flow due to the various anharmonic resonances . in the  one - dimensional \" tier scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the anisotropic nature of the ivr dynamics is hard to discern .",
    "tiers in the state space are formed by zeroth - order states within a certain distance from the bright state and hence still organized by the order of the coupling resonances . in the long time",
    "limit most states that participate in the ivr dynamics are confined , due to the quasi - microcanonical nature of the laser excitation , to an energy shell @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the bright state energy .",
    "the ivr dynamics occurs on a @xmath62-dimensional subspace , refered to as the ivr `` manifold '' , of the state space due to the local nature of the couplings between @xmath44 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "one of the key prediction of the state space model is that the survival probability exhibits a power law at intermediate times@xcite @xmath65^{-d/2 } \\label{powerlaw}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 , the number of vibrational modes of the molecule .",
    "thus the effective dimensionality @xmath62 of the ivr manifold in the state space can be fairly small and a large body of work in the recent years support the state space viewpoint@xcite .",
    "the effective dimensionality itself is crucially dependent on the extent to which classical and quantum mechanisms of ivr manifest themselves at specific energies .",
    "one possible interpretation of @xmath62 is as follows . if @xmath67 then the dynamics in the state space can be thought of as a normal diffusive process and thus ergodic over the state space .",
    "in such a limit for large @xmath17 ( molecules ) the survival can be well approximated by an exponential behaviour . for @xmath66",
    "the ivr dynamics is anisotropic and the dynamics is nonergodic with @xmath62 typically being nonintegral .",
    "note that the terms `` manifold '' and `` effective dimensionality '' are being used a bit loosely since one does not have a very clear idea of the topology of the ivr manifold as of yet .",
    "leitner and wolynes , building upon the earlier work of logan and wolynes@xcite , have provided criteria@xcite for vibrational state mixing and energy flow from the state space perspective . using a local random matrix approach to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ specham ] ) the rate of energy flow out of @xmath44 is given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 being a distance in the state space .",
    "the term @xmath70 represents the average effective coupling of @xmath44 to the states , @xmath71 of them with density @xmath72 , a distance @xmath69 away in state space .",
    "the extent of state mixing is characterized by the transition parameter @xmath73 and the transition between localized and extended states is located at @xmath74 .",
    "the key term is the effective coupling @xmath75 which involves both low and high order resonances .",
    "applications to several systems shows that the predictions based on eq .",
    "( [ lwrate ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lwqet ] ) are both qualitatively and quantitatively@xcite accurate .",
    "the perspective of ivr being a random walk on an effective @xmath62-dimensional manifold in the quantum number space is reasonable@xcite as long as direct anharmonic resonances exist which connect the bright state with the dark states .",
    "it is useful to emphasize again that the existence of direct anharmonic resonances in itself does not imply ergodicity over state space _ i.e. , _ the random walk need not be normal . what happens if , for certain bright states , there are no direct resonances available ?",
    "in other words , the coupling matrix elements @xmath76 for all @xmath77 . what would be the mechanism of ivr , if any , in such cases",
    "? examples of such states in fact correspond to overtone excitations which are typically prepared in experiments .",
    "the overtone states are also called as edge states from the state space viewpoint since most of the excitation is localized in one single mode of the molecule .",
    "thus , for example , in a system with four degrees of freedom a state @xmath78 would be called as an edge state whereas the state @xmath79 , corresponding to a combination state , is called as an interior state .",
    "the edge states , owing to their location in the state space , have fewer anharmonic resonances available for ivr as compared to the interior states .",
    "to some extent such a line of reasoning leads one to anticipate overtone excitations to have slower ivr when compared to the combination states .",
    "a concrete example comes from the theoretical work of holme and hutchinson wherein the dynamics of overtone excitations in a model system representing coupled ch - stretch and cch - bend interacting with an intense laser field was studied@xcite .",
    "they found that classical dynamics predicted no significant energy flow from the high overtone excitations .",
    "however the corresponding quantum calculations did indicate significant ivr . based on their studies",
    "holme and hutchinson concluded that overtone absorption proceeds via dynamical tunneling on timescales of the order of a few nanoseconds .",
    "experimental evidence for the dynamical tunneling route to ivr was provided in a series of elegant works@xcite by the princeton group .",
    "the frequency domain experiments involved the measurement of ivr lifetimes of the acetylinic ch - stretching states in ( cx@xmath80)@xmath80yc*c@xmath81h * molecules with x@xmath82h , d and y@xmath82c , si . the homogeneous line widths , which are related to the rate of ivr out of the initial nonstationary state , arise due to the vibrational couplings between the ch - stretch and the various other vibrational modes of the molecule .",
    "surprisingly kerstel _ et al . _",
    "found@xcite extremely narrow linewidths of the order of 10@xmath83 - 10@xmath84 cm@xmath83 which translate to timescales of the order of thousands of vibrational periods of the ch - stretching vibration .",
    "thus the initially prepared ch - stretch excitation remains localized for extremely long times .",
    "such long ivr timescales were ascribed to the lack of strong / direct anharmonic resonances coupling the ch - stretch with the rest of the molecular vibrations .",
    "the lack of resonances , despite a substantial density of states , combined with ivr timescales of several nanoseconds implies that the mechanism of energy flow is inherently quantum .",
    "another study@xcite by gambogi _",
    "et al . _ examines the possibility of long range resonant vibrational energy exchange between equivalent ch - stretches in ch@xmath80si(c@xmath81ch)@xmath80 .",
    "there have been several experiments@xcite that indicate multiquantum zeroth - order state mixings due to extremely weak couplings of the order of 10@xmath83 - 10@xmath84 cm@xmath83 in highly vibrationally excited molecules .",
    "since the early work by kerstel _",
    "other experimental studies have revealed the existence of the dynamical tunneling mechanism for ivr in large organic molecules .",
    "for instance in a recent work@xcite callegari _",
    "performed experimental and theoretical studies on the ivr dynamics in pyrrole ( c@xmath86h@xmath86nh ) and 1,2,3-triazine ( c@xmath80h@xmath80n@xmath80 ) . specifically , they chose the initial bright states to be the edge state @xmath87 ch - stretch for pyrrole and the interior state @xmath88 corresponding to the ch stretching - ring breathing combination for triazine . in both cases very narrow ivr features , similar to the observations by kerstel _",
    "_ , were seen in the spectrum .",
    "this pointed towards an important role of the off - resonant states to the observed and calculated narrow ivr features .",
    "the analysis by callegari _",
    "et al . _ reveals that near the ivr threshold it is reasonable to expect such highly off - resonant coupling mechanisms to be operative .",
    "another example for the possible existence of the off - resonant mechanism comes from the experiment@xcite by portonov , rosenwaks , and bar wherein the ivr dynamics ensuing from @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ch - acetylinic stretch of 1-butyne are studied .",
    "it was found that the homogeneous linewidth of the @xmath91 state , @xmath92 0.5 cm@xmath83 , is about a factor of two smaller than the widths of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is important to note that the involvement of such off - resonant states can occur at any stage of the ivr process from a tier perspective .",
    "in other words it is possible that the bright state undergoes fast initial ivr due to strong anharmonic resonances with states in the first tier but the subsequent energy flow might be extremely slow .",
    "several experiments point towards the existence of such unusually long secondary ivr time scales which might have profound consequences for the interpretation of the high resolution spectra .",
    "boyarkin and rizzo demonstrated@xcite the slow secondary time scales in their experiments on the ivr from the alkyl ch - stretch overtones of cf@xmath80h . upon excitation of the ch - stretch",
    "fast ivr occurs to the ch stretch - bend combination states on femtosecond timescales .",
    "however the vibrational energy remains localized in the mixed stretch - bend states and flows out to the rest of the molecule on timescales of the order of hundred picoseconds .",
    "similar observations were made@xcite by lubich _",
    "_ on the ivr dynamics of oh - stretch overtone states in ch@xmath80oh .",
    "the interpretation of the above experimental results as due to dynamical tunneling is motivated by the theoretical analysis by stuchebrukhov and marcus in a landmark paper@xcite . in the initial work they explained the narrow features , observed in the experiments@xcite by kerstel _",
    ", by invoking the coupling of the bright states with highly off - resonant gateway states which , in turn , couple back to states that are nearly isoenergetic with the bright state . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] an example of the indirect coupling via a state which is off the energy shell in the state space is illustrated .",
    "more importantly stuchebrukhov and marcus argued that the mechanism , described a little later in this review and anticipated earlier by hutchinson , sibert , and hynes@xcite , involving high order coupling chains is essentially a form of generalized tunneling@xcite .",
    "hence one imagines dynamical barriers which act to prevent classical flow of energy out of the initial ch - stretch whereas quantum dynamical tunneling does lead to energy flow , albeit very slowly .",
    "similar arguments had been put forward by hutchinson demonstrating@xcite the importance of the off - resonant coupling leading to the mixing of nearly degenerate high energy zeroth - order states in cyanoacetylene hcc@xmath81cn . it was argued that such purely quantum relaxation pathway would explain the observed broadening of the overtone bands in various substituted acetylenes .",
    "the above examples highlight the possible connections between ivr and dynamical tunneling .",
    "however it was realized very early on that observations of local mode doublets@xcite in molecular spectra and the clustering of rotational energy sublevels with high angular momenta@xcite can also be associated with dynamical tunneling .",
    "indeed much of our understanding of the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling in the context of molecular spectra comes from these early works .",
    "one of the key feature of the analysis was the focus on a phase space description of dynamical tunneling _",
    "i.e. , _ identifying the disconnected regions in the phase space and hence classical structures which could be identified as dynamical barriers . thus the mechanism of dynamical tunneling , confirmed by computing the splittings based on specific phase space structures , could be understood in exquisite detail .",
    "however such detailed phase space analysis are exceedingly difficult , if not impossible , for large molecules .",
    "for example in the case of the ( cx@xmath80)@xmath80ycch system there are @xmath93 vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "any attempt to answer the questions on the origin and location of the dynamical barriers in the phase space is seemingly a futile excercise .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that stuchebrukhov and marcus , although aware of the phase space perspective , provided a purely quantum explanation for the ivr in terms of the chain of off - resonant states@xcite .",
    "thus one can not help but ask if the phase space viewpoint is really needed .",
    "the answer is affirmative and many reasons can be provided that justify the need and utility of a phase space viewpoint .",
    "first , as noted by heller@xcite , the concept of tunneling is meaningless without the classical mechanics of the system as a baseline . in other words , in order to label a process as purely quantum it is imperative that one establishes the absence of the process within classical dynamics .",
    "note that for dynamical tunneling it might not be easy to _ a priori _ make such a distinction .",
    "there are mechanisms of classical transport , especially in systems with three or more degrees of freedom , involving long timescales which might give an impression of a tunneling process .",
    "it is certainly not possible to differentiate between classically allowed and forbidden mechanisms by studying the spectral intensity and splitting patterns alone due to the nontrivial role played by the stochasticity in the classical phase space .",
    "secondly , the quantum explanation is in essence a method to calculate the contribution of dynamical tunneling to the ivr rates in polyatomic molecules . in order to have a complete qualitative picture of dynamical tunneling",
    "it is necessary , as emphasised by stuchebrukhov and marcus@xcite , to find an explicit form of the effective dynamical potential in the state space of the molecule .",
    "third reason , mainly due to the important insights gained from recent studies , has to do with the sensitivity of dynamical tunneling to the stochasticity in the phase space@xcite .",
    "chaos can enhance as well as supress dynamical tunneling and for large molecules the phase space can be mixed regular - chaotic even at energies corresponding to the first or second overtone levels . undoubtedly the signatures should be present in the splitting and intensity patterns in a high resolution spectrum .",
    "however the precise mechanism which governs the substantial enhancement / suppression of dynamical tunneling , and perhaps ivr rates is not yet clear .",
    "nevertheless recent developements indicate that a phase space approach is capable of providing both qualitative and quantitative insights into the problem .",
    "a final argument in favor of a phase space perspective needs to be mentioned .",
    "it might appear that the dimensionality issue is not all that restrictive for the quantum studies _ a la _ stuchebrukhov and marcus .",
    "however it will become clear from the discussions in the later sections that in the case of large systems even calculating , for example local mode splittings via the minimal perturbative expression in eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) can be prohibitively difficult .",
    "one might argue that a clever basis would reduce the number of perturbative terms that need to be considered or alternatively one can look for and formulate criteria that would allow for a reliable estimate of the splitting . unfortunately , _ a priori _ knowledge of the clever basis or the optimal set of terms to be retained in eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) implies a certain level of insight into the dynamics of the system .",
    "the main theme of this article is to convey the message that such insights truly originate from the classical phase space viewpoint . with the above reasons in mind the next section provides brief reviews of the earlier approaches to dynamical tunneling from the phase space perspective",
    "this will then set the stage to discuss the more recent advances and the issues involved in the molecular context .",
    "in a series of pioneering papers@xcite , nearly a quarter of a century ago , lawton and child showed that the experimentally observed local mode doublets in h@xmath94o could be associated with a generalized tunneling in the momentum space . in molecular spectroscopy",
    "it was appreciated from very early on that highly excited spectra associated with x - h stretching vibrations are better described in terms of local modes rather than the conventional normal modes@xcite . in a zeroth - order description",
    "this corresponds to very weakly coupled , if not uncoupled , anharmonic oscillators .",
    "every anharmonic oscillator , modelled by an appropriate morse function , represents a specific local stretching mode of the molecule .",
    "the central question that lawton and child asked was that to what extent are the molecular vibrations actually localized in the individual bonds ( local modes ) ? analyzing the classical dynamics on the sorbie - murrell potential energy surface for h@xmath94o , focusing on the two local o - h stretches , it was found that a clear distinction between normal mode and local mode behaviour could be observed in the phase space .",
    "the classical phase space at appropriate energies revealed@xcite two equivalent but classically disconnected regions as a signature of local mode dynamics .",
    "lawton and child immediately noted the topological similarity between their two dimensional poincar surface of section and the phase space of a one dimensional symmetric double well potential .",
    "however they also noted that the barrier was in momentum space and hence the lifting of the local mode degeneracy was due to a generalized tunneling in the momentum space .",
    "detailed classical@xcite , quantum@xcite , and semiclassical@xcite investigations of the system allowed lawton and child to provide an approximate formula for the splitting @xmath95 between two symmetry related local mode states @xmath96 as : @xmath97 the variables @xmath25 correspond to the mass - weighted momenta and coordinates@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that lawton and child realized , correctly , that the frequency factor @xmath98 should be evaluated at a fixed total quantum number @xmath99 .",
    "however the choice of the tunneling path @xmath100 proved to be more difficult . eventually @xmath100 was taken to be a one dimensional , nondynamical path in the two dimensional coordinate space of the symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes .",

    "incidentally , the word _ dynamical tunneling _ was first introduced by davis and heller .",

    "an initial state @xmath136 implies a certain energy distribution in the molecule and the nontrivial time dependence signals flow of energy in the molecule .",
    "later studies by hutchinson , sibert , and hynes showed@xcite that based on the dynamics the various initial states could be classified as normal modes or local modes .",
    "morever at the border between the two classes were initial states that led to a ` nonclassical ' energy flow .",
    "a representative example , using a different but equivalent system , for the three classes is shown in fig .",
    "the normal mode regime illustrated with @xmath139 shows complete energy flow between the modes on the time scale of a few vibrational periods - something that occurs classically as well .",
    "the local mode behaviour for the initial state @xmath140 exhibits complete energy transfer resulting in the state @xmath141 but the timescale is now hundreds of vibrational periods . despite the large timescales involved it is important to note that such a process does not happen classically .",

    "the so called nonclassical case illustrated with an initial state @xmath142 is also an example of dynamical tunneling .",
    "however the associated timescale is nowhere as large when compared to the local mode regime@xcite .",
    "the vibrational energy transfer process illustrated through the initial state @xmath140 and @xmath142 are examples of pure quantum routes to energy flow .",
    "hutchinson , sibert , and hynes proposed@xcite that the mechanism for this quantum energy flow can be understood as an indirect state - to - state flow of probability involving normal mode intermediate states .",
    "for instance , in the case involving the initial state @xmath140 the following mechanism was proposed : @xmath143 the reason for this indirect route has to do with the fact that estimating the splitting directly ( at first order ) @xmath144 yields a value which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the the actual value@xcite .",
    "indeed note that the indirect route corresponds to a third order perturbation in the coupling and hence it is possible to estimate the contribution to the splitting as : @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the zeroth - order energies associated with the states @xmath136 .    once again",
    "a clear interpretation of the mechanism comes from taking a closer look at the underlying classical phase space@xcite . using the classical action - angle variables @xmath148 for morse oscillators it is possible to write the original hamiltonian in eq .",

    "thus the key term in the above hamiltonian is the hindered rotor part denoted by @xmath163 and the analysis now focuses on a one dimensional hamiltonian due to the fact that @xmath164 is a conserved quantity .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( nc ) , in the intermediate state @xmath181 involved in the energy transfer process @xmath186 .",
    "it was also commented@xcite that the double well analogy provided by davis and heller@xcite was very different from the one that emerges from the hindered rotor analysis - local modes in the former case would be trapped below the barrier whereas they are above the barrier in the latter case .",
    "finally , a very important observation@xcite was that small amounts of asymmetry between the two modes quenched the @xmath187 process whereas there was little effect on the @xmath186 process .",
    "the different effects of the asymmetry was one of the primary reasons for distinguishing between local and nonclassical states .",
    "several questions arise at this stage .",
    "is the rotor analysis applicable to the lawton - child and davis - heller systems ?",
    "why is there a difference in the interpretation of the local modes , and hence the mechanism of dynamical tunneling , between the phase space and hindered rotor pictures ?",
    "is it reasonable to neglect the higher order @xmath184:@xmath188:@xmath189 resonances solely based on the relative strengths ?",
    "if multiple resonances do exist then one has the possibility of their overlap leading to chaos .",
    "is it still possible to use the rotor formalism in the mixed phase space regimes ?",
    "some of the questions were answered in a work by stefanski and pollak wherein a periodic orbit quantization technique was proposed to calculate the splittings@xcite .",
    "stefanski and pollak pointed out@xcite an important difference between the davis - heller and the sibert - reinhardt - hynes hamiltonians in terms of the periodic orbits at low energies .",
    "nevertheless , they were able to show that a harmonic approximation to the tunneling action integral eq .",
    "( [ tunact ] ) yields an expression for the splitting which is identical to the one derived by assuming that the symmetric stretch periodic ( unstable ) orbit gives rise to a barrier separating the two local mode states - an interpretation that davis and heller provided in their work@xcite .",
    "thus stefanski and pollak resolved an apparent paradox and emphasized the true phase space nature of dynamical tunneling .    in any case it is worth noting that irrespective of the representation the key feature is the existence of a dynamical barrier separating two qualitatively different motions ; the corresponding structure in the phase space had to do with the appearance of a resonance .",
    "further support for the importance of the resonance to tunneling between tori in the phase space came from a beautiful analysis by ozorio de almeida@xcite which , as seen later , forms an important basis for the recent advances . a different viewpoint , using group theoretic arguments , based on the concept of dynamical symmetry breaking was advanced@xcite by kellman .",
    "adapting kellman s arguments , originally applied to the local mode spectrum of benzene , imagine placing one quantum in one of the local o - h stretching mode of h@xmath94o .",
    "classially the energy remains localized in this bond and thus there is a lowering or breaking of the @xmath190 point group symmetry of the molecule .",
    "however quantum mechanically , dynamical tunneling restores the broken symmetry .",
    "invoking the more general permutation - inversion group@xcite and its feasible subgroups provides insights into the pattern of local mode splittings and hence insights into the energy transfer pathways via dynamical tunneling .",
    "the dominance of a pathway of course can not be established within a group theoretic approach alone and requires additional analysis .",
    "note that recently@xcite babyuk , wyatt , and frederick have reexamined the dynamical tunneling in the davis - heller and the coupled morse systems via the bohmian approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "analysing the relevant quantum trajectories babyuk _ et al .",
    "_ discovered that there were several regions , at different times , wherein the potential energy exceeds the total energy ( which includes the quantum potential ) . in this sense , locally , one has a picture that is similar to tunneling through a one dimensional potential barrier .",
    "interestingly such regions were associated with the so - called quasinodes which arise during the dynamical evolution of the density .",
    "therefore the dynamical nature of the barriers is clearly evident , but more work is needed to understand the origin and distributions of the quasinodes in a given system .",
    "needless to say , correlating the nature of the quasinodes to the underlying phase space structures would be a useful endeavour .",
    "the earlier works established the importance of the phase space perspective for dynamical tunneling using systems that possesed discrete symmetries and therefore implicitly invoked an analogy to symmetric double well models .",
    "that is not to say that the earlier studies presumed that dynamical tunneling would only occur in symmetric systems . indeed",
    "a careful study of the various papers reveal several insightful comments on asymmetric systems as well .",

    "stuchebrukhov and marcus argued@xcite that since the initial , localized ( bright ) state is not directly coupled by anharmonic resonances to the other zeroth - order states it is necessary to invoke off - resonant virtual states to explain the sluggish flow of energy .",

    "this suggests that the high - order perturbation theory , if valid , is the correct approach to calculating dynamical tunneling splittings in multidimensions .",
    "an additional consequence is that the nonclassical mechanism of ivr is equivalent to dynamical tunneling as opposed to the earlier suggestion@xcite of an activated barrier crossing . as a cautionary note",

    "the observation that the superexchange @xmath204 can be derived@xcite from a semiclassical action integral provides a clue to some of the issues .",
    "however an explicit demonstration of such a correspondence has been provided only in the single resonance ( hindered rotor ) case . in the multidimensional case",
    "the multiplicity of paths obscures this correspondence .",
    "the next few sections highlight the recent advances which show that clear answers to the various questions raised above come from viewing the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling in the most natural representation - the classical phase space .",
    "nearly a decade ago heller wrote a brief review@xcite on dynamical tunneling and its spectral consequences which was motivated in large part by the work of stuchebrukhov and marcus@xcite .",
    "focusing on systems with two degrees of freedom in the near - integrable regimes , characteristic of polyatomic molecules at low energies , heller argued that the @xmath230-@xmath231 cm@xmath83 _ broadening of lines is due to dynamical tunneling between remote regions of phase space facilitated by distant resonances_. this is an intriguing statement which could perhaps be interpreted in many different ways .",
    "moreover the meaning of the words remote and distant are not immediately clear and fraught with conceptual difficulties in a multidimensional phase space setting .",
    "in essence heller s statement , more appropriately called as a conjecture , is an effort to provide a phase space picture of the superexchange mixing between two or more widely separated zeroth - order states in the state space .",
    "some of the examples in the later part of the present review , hopefully , demonstrate that the conjecture is reasonable .",
    "interestingly though in the same review it is mentioned@xcite that in the presence of widespread chaos the issue of tunneling as a mechanism for ivr is of doubtful utility .",
    "similar sentiments were echoed by stuchebrukhov _",
    "who , in the case of high dimensional phase spaces , envisaged partial rupturing of the invariant tori and hence domination of ivr by chaotic diffusion rather than dynamical tunneling .",
    "this too has to be considered as a conjecture at the present time since the timescales and the competition between chaotic diffusion ( classically allowed ) and dynamical tunneling ( classically forbidden ) in systems with three or more degrees of freedom has not been studied in any detail .",
    "the issues involved are subtle and extrapolating the insights from studies on two degrees of freedom to higher degrees of freedom is incorrect .",
    "for instance , in three and higher degrees of freedom the invariant tori , ruptured or not , do not have the right dimensionality to act as barriers to inhibit diffusion .",
    "therefore , is it possible that classical chaos could assist or inhibit dynamical tunneling ?",
    "several studies@xcite carried out during the early nineties till the present time point to an important role played by chaos in the process of dynamical tunneling .",
    "we start with a brief review of these studies followed by very detailed investigations into the role played by the nonlinear resonances .",
    "finally , some of the very recent work is highlighted which suggest that the combination of resonances and chaos in the phase space can yet play an important role in ivr .",
    "one of the first studies on the possible influence of chaos on tunneling was made by lin and ballentine@xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the tunneling dynamics of a driven double well system described by the hamiltonian @xmath232 which has the discrete symmetry @xmath233 with @xmath234 . in the absence of the monochromatic field ( @xmath235 )",
    "the system is integrable and the phase space is identical to that of a one dimensional symmetric double well potential .",
    "however with @xmath236 the system is nonintegrable and the phase space is mixed regular - chaotic . despite the mixed phase space",
    "the discrete symmetry implies that any regular islands in the phase space will occur in symmetry related pairs and the quantum floquet states will occur as doublets with even / odd symmetries .",
    "a coherent state ( wavepacket ) localized on one of the regular islands will tunnel to the other , clasically disconnected , symmetry related island .",
    "thus this is an example of dynamical tunneling .",
    "an important observation by lin and ballentine was that the tunneling was enhanced@xcite by orders of magnitude in regimes wherein significant chaos existed in the phase space .",
    "for example with @xmath237 the ground state tunneling time is about @xmath238 whereas with @xmath239 the tunneling time is only about @xmath240 .",
    "futhermore strong fluctuations in the tunneling times were observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] a typical example of the fluctuations over several orders of magnitude are shown . the crucial thing to note , however , is that the gross phase space structures are similar over the entire range shown in fig .",
    "thus although the chaos seems to influence the tunneling the mechanistic insights were lacking _",
    "i.e. , _ the precise role of the stochasticity was not understood .",
    "[ htbp ]    .",

    "the initial state corresponds to a coherent state localized on the left regular island ( indicated by an arrow ) .",
    "the three phase space strobe plots at increasing values of @xmath245 indicated in ( a ) show the local structure near the left island . despite the phase space being",
    "very similar the tunneling times fluctuate over many orders of magnitude .",

    "subsequently other works@xcite on a wide variety of driven systems established the sensitivity of tunneling to the classical stochasticity .",

    "a comprehensive account of the various studies on driven systems can be found in the review@xcite by grifoni and hnggi .",

    "perhaps it is apt to highlight a historical fact mentioned by gong and brumer - _ coherent control emerged from two research groups engaged in studies of chaotic dynamics_.    in the lin - ballentine example above the perturbation ( applied field ) not only increases the size of the chaotic region but also affects the dynamics of the unperturbed tunneling doublet . hence the enhanced tunneling ,",
    "relative to the unperturbed or the weakly perturbed case , can not be immediately ascribed to the increased amount of chaos in the phase space . to observe a more direct influence of chaos on tunneling it",
    "is necessary that the classical phase space dynamics scales with energy .",
    "investigations of the coupled quartic oscillator system by bohigas , tomsovic , and ullmo@xcite provided the first detailed view of the cat process .",
    "the choice of the hamiltonian @xmath247 \\label{btuham}\\ ] ] with @xmath248 was made in order to study the classical - quantum correspondence in detail .",
    "this is due to the fact that the potential is homogeneous and hence the dynamics at a specific energy @xmath3 is related to the dynamics at a different energy by a simple rescaling .",
    "consequently one can fix the energy and investigate the effect of the semiclassical limit @xmath249 on the tunneling process .",
    "the classical dynamics is integrable for @xmath250 and strongly chaotic for @xmath251 .",
    "again , note that the hamiltonian has the discrete symmetry @xmath252 and thus the quantum eigenstates are expected to show up as symmetry doublets .",

    "on the other hand for @xmath263 chaos becomes pervasive and @xmath117 exhibits severe fluctuations .",
    "tomsovic and ullmo argued@xcite that the fluctuations in @xmath117 could be traced to the crossing of the quasidegenerate doublets with a third irregular state . by irregular",
    "it is meant that when viewed from the phase space the state density , represented by either the wigner or the husimi distribution function , is appreciable in the chaotic sea .",
    "the irregular state , in contrast to the regular states , do not come as doublets since there is no dynamical partition of the chaotic region into mutually exclusive symmetric parts .",
    "nevertheless the irregular states do have fixed parities with respect to the reflection operations .",
    "thus chaos - assisted tunneling is necessarily atleast a three - state process@xcite .",

    "detailed theoretical studies@xcite of the dynamical tunneling process in annular billiards by frischat and doron confirmed the crucial role of the classical phase space structure .",
    "specifically it was found that the tunneling between two symmetry related whisphering gallery modes ( corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise rotating motion in the billiard ) is strongly influenced by quantum states that inhabit the regular - chaotic border in the phase space .",
    "such states were termed as `` beach states '' by frischat and doron .",

    "details of the experiment can be found in a recent paper@xcite by hofferbert _",
    "_ wherein support for the crucial role of the beach region is provided .",
    "it is , however , significant to note that the regular - chaotic border in case of the annular billiards is quite sharp .    an important point to note",
    "is that despite the intutively appealing three - state model , determining the coupling @xmath267 between the regular and chaotic states is nontrivial .",
    "this , in turn , is related to the fact that accurate determination of the positions of the chaotic levels can be a difficult task and determining the nature of a chaotic state for systems with mixed phase spaces is still an open problem .",
    "such difficulties prompted tomsovic and ullmo@xcite to adopt a statistical approach , based on random matrix theory , to determine the tunneling splitting distribution @xmath274 in terms of the variance of the regular - chaotic coupling _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath275 . in a later work leyvraz and ullmo showed@xcite",
    "that @xmath274 is a truncated cauchy distribution @xmath276 with @xmath277 being the mean splitting . on the other hand creagh and",
    "whelan@xcite showed that the splitting between states localized in the chaotic regions of the phase space but separated by an energetic barrier is characterized by a specific tunneling orbit . specifically , the resulting splitting distribution depends on the stability of the tunneling orbit and is not universal . in certain limits@xcite the splittings",
    "obey the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "thus the fluctuations in @xmath117 in the cat process are different from those found in the usual double - well system .",
    "note that in case of cat the distribution pertains to the splitting between states localized in the regular regions of phase space embedded in the chaotic sea .",
    "the reader is referred to the excellent discussion by creagh for details@xcite . nevertheless , in a recent work mouchet and delande observed@xcite that the @xmath274 exhibits a truncated cauchy behaviour despite a near - integrable phase space .",
    "similar observations have been made by carvalho and mijolaro in their study of the splitting distribution in the annular billiard system as well@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the leyvraz - ullmo distribution eq .",
    "( [ trunccauchy ] ) is not sufficient to characterize cat .",
    "a first step towards obtaining a semiclassical estimate of the regular - chaotic coupling was taken by podolskiy and narimanov@xcite . assuming a regular island seperated by a structureless , on the scale of @xmath260 , chaotic sea they were able to show that : @xmath278 with @xmath279 and a system specific proportionality factor which is independent of @xmath260 . the phase space area covered by the regular island",

    "application of the theory by podolskiy and narimanov to the splittings between near - degenerate optical modes , localized on a pair of symmetric regular islands in phase space , in a non - integrable microcavity yielded very good agreement with the exact data@xcite .",
    "in fact podolskiy and narimanov have recently shown@xcite that the lifetimes and emission patterns of optical modes in asymmetric microresonators are strongly affected by cat .",
    "encouraging results were obtained in the case of tunneling in periodically modulated optial lattices as well . however",

    "such plateau regions have been noted earlier@xcite by roncaglia _",
    "et al . _ and in several other recent studies@xcite as well .",
    "the qualitative picture that emerged from the numerous studies is that cat process is a result of competition between classically allowed ( mixing or transport in the chaotic sea ) and classically forbidden ( tunneling or coupling between regular regions and the chaotic sea ) dynamics . despite the significant advancements , the mechanism by which a state localized in the regular island couples to the chaotic sea continued to puzzle the researchers .",
    "it might therefore come as a surprise that based on recent studies there is growing evidence that the explanation for the regular - chaotic coupling lies in the nonlinear resonances and partial barriers in the phase space .",
    "the work by podolskiy and narimanov provides one possible answer but an equally strong clue is hidden in the plateaus that occur in a typical @xmath282 versus @xmath281 plot .",
    "it is perhaps reasonable to expect that the theory of podolskiy and narimanov is correct when phase space structures like the nonlinear resonances and partial barriers , ignored in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ podnari ] ) , in the vicinity of regular - chaotic border regions are much smaller in area as compared to the planck constant @xmath260 .",
    "however , for sufficiently small @xmath260 the rich hierarchy of structures like nonlinear resonances , partially broken tori , cantori , and even vague tori in the regular - chaotic border region have to be taken into consideration .",
    "it is significant to note that tomsovic and ullmo had already recognized the importance of accounting for mechanisms which tend to limit classical transport@xcite and proposed generalized random matrix ensembles as a possible approach .",
    "there also exist a number of studies@xcite , involving less than three degrees of freedom , which highlight the nature of the regular - chaotic border and their importance to tunneling between kam tori .",
    "a different perspective on the influence of chaos on dynamical tunneling came from the detailed investigations by ikeda and coworkers involving the study@xcite of semiclassical propagators in the complex phase space .",
    "in particular , deep insights into cat were gained by examining the so called  laputa chains \" which contribute dominantly to the propagator in the presence of chaos@xcite . for a detailed review",
    "the paper@xcite by shudo and ikeda is highly reccommended .",
    "hashimoto and takatsuka@xcite discuss a situation wherein dynamical tunneling leads to mixing between states localized about unstable fixed points in the phase space .",

    "the key ingredient to the success of the theory are the nonlinear resonances in the phase space .",

    "[ fig23 ] one can imagine a scenario wherein a sequence of dynamical tunneling events finally lands up close to a resonance junction .",
    "would the classical erratic motion near the junction interfere with the dynamical tunneling process ?",
    "is it then possible that an edge state might compete with an interior state due to cat and/or rat ?",
    "note that the four zeroth - order states in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] are in fact close to one such resonance junction .",
    "the classical survival probabilities in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] indicate some transport but further studies are required in order to characterize the classical transport .",
    "the issues involved are subtle since the competition between the coexisting classical and quantum routes has hardly been studied up until now and warrants further attention .",
    "few of the studies that have been performed@xcite to date suggest that quantum effects tend to localize the along - resonance diffusion on the web .",
    "nearly a decade ago leitner and wolynes analysed@xcite the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ specham ] ) to understand the role of the vibrational superexchange at low energies . within the state space approach",
    "it was argued that the superexchange mechanisms contribute significantly to the energy flow from the edge states to the interior of the state space .",
    "more importantly the superexchange contributions modify the ivr threshold as quantified by the transition parameter @xmath560 defined in eq .",
    "( [ lwqet ] ) . from the phase space perspective as in fig .  [ fig23 ]",
    "the direct and superexchange processes correspond to classical and quantum dynamical tunneling mechanisms respectively which are determined by the topology of the web .",
    "in contrast , note that the present studies on the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 3dham ] ) actually shows dynamical tunneling at fairly high energies and between interior states in the state space .",
    "further studies on such model systems would lead to better insights into the nature of @xmath560 .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to see if the criteria @xmath561 of leitner and wolynes is related to the criteria for efficient cat and rat in the phase space .",
    "needless to say , such studies combined with the idea of local control demonstrated in the pevious section can provide important insights towards controlling ivr .",
    "the effective @xmath260 is expected to play a central role in deciding the importance of various phase space structures .",
    "however intutive notions based entirely on this ` geometrical ' criteria can be misleading . for instance , gong and brumer in their studies@xcite on the modified kicked rotor found the quantum dynamics to be strongly influenced by regular islands in the phase space whose areas were at least an order of magnitude smaller than the effective planck constant .",
    "another example comes from the work by sirko and koch@xcite wherein it was observed that the ionization of bichromatically driven hydrogen atoms is mediated by nonlinear common resonances@xcite with phase space areas of the order of the planck constant .",
    "further examples can be found in the recent studies@xcite .",
    "although for large molecules the vibrational superexchange viewpoint is perhaps the only choice for computations , for a mechanistic understanding the phase space perspective is inevitable .",
    "furthermore , as noted earlier , there exists ample evidence for the notion that even in large molecules the actual effective dimensionality of the ivr manifold in the state space is far less than the theoretical maximum of @xmath562 .",
    "hence detailed classical - quantum correspondence studies of systems with three or four degrees of freedom can provide useful insights into the ivr processes in large molecules . at the same time",
    "a proper understanding of and including the effect of partial barriers into the theory of dynamical tunneling is necessary for further progress .",
    "some hints to the delicate competition between quantum and classical transport through cantori can be found in the fairly detailed studies by maitra and heller@xcite on the dynamics generated by the whisker map@xcite .",
    "such studies are required to gain insights into the method of controlling quantum dynamics via suitable modifications of the local phase space structures@xcite .",
    "extending the local phase space control idea to systems with higher degrees of freedom poses a difficult challenge . if the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig23 ] is reasonable then it suggests that the real origins of the hierarchical nature of ivr , due to both quantum and classical routes , is intricately tied to the geometry of the arnold web .",
    "significant efforts are needed to characterize the resonance web dynamically in order to have a clear understanding of how the specific features of the web influence the ivr .",
    "recent works@xcite are beginning to focus on extracting such details in systems with three or more degrees of freedom which promises to provide valuable insights into the classical and quantum mechanisms of ivr in polyatomic molecules .",
    "perhaps such an understanding would allow one to locally perturb specific regions of the resonance web and hence ultimately lead to control over the classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge several useful discussions with arul lakshminarayan and peter schlagheck on the topic of dynamical tunneling .",
    "i am grateful to prof .",

    "<S> dynamical tunneling , introduced in the molecular context , is more than two decades old and refers to phenomena that are classically forbidden but allowed by quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the barriers for dynamical tunneling , however , can arise in the momentum or more generally in the full phase space of the system . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) has occupied a central place in the field of chemical physics for a much longer period of time . despite significant progress in understanding ivr _ a priori _ prediction of the pathways and rates </S>",
    "<S> is still a difficult task . </S>",
    "<S> although the two phenomena seem to be unrelated several studies indicate that dynamical tunneling , in terms of its mechanism and timescales , can have important implications for ivr . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to associate dynamical tunneling with a purely quantum mechanism of ivr . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the observation of local mode doublets , clustering of rotational energy levels , and extremely narrow vibrational features in high resolution molecular spectra . </S>",
    "<S> many researchers have demonstrated the usefulness of a phase space perspective towards understanding the mechanism of ivr . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly dynamical tunneling is also strongly influenced by the nature of the underlying classical phase space . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies show that chaos and nonlinear resonances in the phase space can enhance or suppress dynamical tunneling by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> is it then possible that both the classical and quantum mechanisms of ivr , and the potential competition between them , can be understood within the phase space perspective ? </S>",
    "<S> this review focuses on addressing the question by providing the current state of understanding of dynamical tunneling from the phase space perspective and the consequences for intramolecular vibrational energy flow in polyatomic molecules .    to appear in international reviews in physical chemistry ( october 2007 ) </S>"
