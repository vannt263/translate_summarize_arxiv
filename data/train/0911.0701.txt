    "a self - consistent description of the formation of globular clusters remains a challenge to theorists .",
    "a particularly puzzling observation is the apparent bimodality , or even multimodality , of the color distribution of globular cluster systems in galaxies ranging from dwarf disks to giant ellipticals .",
    "this color bimodality likely translates into a bimodal distribution of the abundances of heavy elements such as iron .",
    "we know this to be the case in the galaxy as well as in m31 , where relatively accurate spectral measurements exist for a large fraction of the clusters .",
    "the two most frequently encountered modes are commonly called _ blue _ ( metal - poor ) and _ red _ ( metal - rich ) .",
    "bimodality in the globular cluster metallicity distribution of luminous elliptical galaxies was proposed by @xcite , following a theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "the concept of cluster bimodality became universally accepted because the two populations also differ in other observed characteristics .",
    "the system of red clusters have a significant rotation velocity similar to the disk stars whereas blue clusters have little rotational support , in the three disk galaxies observed in detail : milky way , m31 , and m33 . in elliptical galaxies ,",
    "blue clusters have a higher velocity dispersion than red clusters , both due to lack of rotation and more extended spatial distribution .",
    "red clusters are usually more spatially concentrated than blue clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of these differences , however , are in external properties ( location and kinematics ) , which reflect _ where _ the clusters formed , but not _ how_. the internal properties of the red and blue clusters are similar : masses , sizes , and ages , with only slight differences .",
    "even the metallicities themselves differ typically by a factor of 10 between the two modes , not enough to affect the dynamics of molecular clouds from which these clusters formed .",
    "could it be then that both red and blue clusters form in a similar way on small scales , such as in giant molecular clouds , while the differences in their metallicity and spatial distribution reflect when and where such clouds assemble ?",
    "all scenarios proposed in the literature assumed different formation mechanisms for the red and blue clusters , and most scenarios envisioned the stellar population of one mode to be tightly linked to that of the host galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , strader et al .",
    "the other mode is assumed to have formed differently , in some unspecified `` primordial '' way .",
    "this assumption only pushed the problem back in time but it did not solve it .",
    "for example , @xcite used a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation to study bimodality in luminous elliptical galaxies and needed two separate prescriptions for the blue and red clusters . in their model , red clusters formed in gas - rich mergers with a fixed efficiency of 0.007 relative to field stars , while blue clusters formed in quiescent disks with a different efficiency of 0.002 .",
    "the formation of blue clusters also had to be artificially truncated at @xmath0 . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the blue clusters could instead have formed in very small halos at @xmath1 , before cosmic reionization removed cold gas from such halos .",
    "this scenario requires high efficiency of cluster formation in the small halos and also places stringent constraints on the age spread of blue clusters to be less than 0.5 gyr .",
    "unfortunately , even the most recent measurements of the relative cluster ages in the galaxy ( @xcite ) can not detect age differences smaller than 9% , or about 1 gyr , and therefore can not support or falsify the reionization scenario .",
    "we set out to test whether a common mechanism could explain the formation of both red and blue modes and produce an entire metallicity distribution consistent with the observations .",
    "we begin with a premise of the hierarchical galaxy formation in a @xmath2cdm universe .",
    "primordial density fluctuations in the early universe , probed directly by the cmb anisotropies , set the seeds for structure formation .",
    "cosmological numerical simulations study the growth of the fluctuations via gravitational instability and show us a history of galaxy assembly .",
    "the simulations begin with tiny deviations from the hubble flow , whose amplitudes are set by the measured power spectrum while the phases are assigned randomly .",
    "therefore , each particular simulation provides only a statistical description of a representative part of the universe , although current models successfully reproduce major features of observed galaxies .    .",

    "we adopt this single formation mechanism and assume that globular clusters form only during massive gas - rich mergers .",
    "we follow the merging process of progenitor galaxies in a galaxy - sized environment using a set of cosmological @xmath5-body simulations from @xcite .",
    "we need to decide what type and how many clusters will form in each merger event . for this purpose ,",
    "we use observed scaling relations to assign each dark matter subhalo a certain amount of cold gas that will be available for star formation throughout cosmic time and an average metallicity of that gas . in order to keep the model transparent , we choose as simple a parametrization of the cold gas mass as possible .",
    "finally , we make the simplest assumption that the mass of all globular clusters formed in the merger is linearly proportional to the mass of this cold gas , @xmath6 .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ sec : met ] .",
    "although such model appears extremely simplistic , we have some confidence that it may capture main elements of the formation of massive clusters .",
    "@xcite used a hydrodynamic simulation of the galactic environment at high redshifts @xmath7 and found dense , massive gas clouds within the protogalactic clumps .",
    "these clouds assemble during gas - rich mergers of progenitor galaxies , when the cold gas forms a thin , self - gravitating disk .",
    "the disk develops strong spiral arms , which further fragment into separate molecular clouds located along the arms as beads on a string ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gc ] ) .",
    "if the high - density regions of these clouds formed star clusters , the resulting distributions of cluster mass , size , and metallicity are consistent with those of the galactic metal - poor clusters .",
    "the high stellar density of galactic clusters restricts their parent clouds to be in relatively massive progenitors , with the total mass @xmath8 .",
    "the mass of the molecular clouds increases with cosmic time , but the rate of mergers declines steadily .",
    "therefore , the cluster formation efficiency peaks during an extended epoch , @xmath9 , when the universe is less than 2 gyr old .",
    "the molecular clouds are massive enough to be shielded from the extragalactic uv radiation , so that globular cluster formation is unaffected by the reionization of cosmic hydrogen .",
    "the mass function of model clusters is consistent with a power law @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , similar to the local young star clusters .",

    "( 2004 ) @xmath5-body simulation in order to calculate cluster orbits to @xmath14 .",
    "we used the evolving properties of all progenitor halos , from the outputs with a time resolution of @xmath15 yr , to derive the gravitational potential in the whole computational volume at all epochs .",
    "we calculated the orbits of globular clusters in this potential from the time when their host galaxies accrete onto the main ( most massive ) galaxy .",
    "using these orbits , we calculated the dynamical evolution of model clusters , including the effects of stellar mass loss , two - body relaxation , tidal truncation , and tidal shocks .",
    "in this model , all clusters form on nearly circular orbits within the protogalactic disks . depending on the subsequent trajectories of the hosts , clusters form three main subsystems at present time . _ disk clusters _ formed in the most massive progenitor that eventually hosts the present galactic disk .",
    "these clusters , found within the inner 10 kpc , do not actually stay on circular orbits but instead are scattered to eccentric orbits by perturbations from accreted galactic satellites . _",

    "their orbits are inclined with respect to the galactic disk and are fairly isotropic .",
    "_ outer halo clusters _ , beyond 60 kpc from the center ,",
    "are either still associated with the surviving satellite galaxies , or were scattered away from their hosts during close encounters with other satellites and consequently appear isolated .",
    "the azimuthally - averaged space density of globular clusters is consistent with a power law , @xmath16 , with the slope @xmath17 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : density ] ) .",
    "since all of the distant clusters originate in progenitor galaxies and share similar orbits with their hosts , the distribution of the clusters is almost identical to that of the surviving satellite halos .",
    "this power law is similar to the observed slope of the metal - poor ( @xmath18 } } < -1 $ ] ) globular clusters in the galaxy .",

    "it is largely determined by the orbits of the progenitor galaxies and the epoch of formation .",
    "@xcite showed that the early - forming halos are more spatially concentrated and in order to match the galactic distribution , globular clusters would need to form at @xmath19 .",
    "however , such an early formation is inconsistent with the requirement of high mass and density of the parent molecular clouds . at present",

    "following the scenario outlined above , a. muratov & o. gnedin ( in prep . ) developed a semi - analytical model that aims to reproduce statistically the metallicity distribution of the galactic globular clusters , as compiled by @xcite .",
    "the formation of clusters is triggered during a merger of gas - rich protogalaxies with the mass ratio 1:5 or higher , and during very early mergers with any mass ratio when the cold gas fraction in the progenitors is close to 100% .",

    "our prescription links cluster metallicity to the average galaxy metallicity in a one - to - one relation , albeit with random scatter .",
    "since the average galaxy metallicity grows monotonically with time , the cluster metallicity also grows with time .",
    "the model thus encodes an age - metallicity relation , in the sense that metal - rich clusters are younger than their metal - poor counterparts by several gyr .",
    "however , figure [ fig : age_metal ] shows that clusters of the same age may differ in metallicity by as much as a factor of 10 , as they formed in the progenitors of different mass .",
