    "in the unified scheme for agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) , type  2 narrow lines active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are normal type  1 agns with both the characteristic broad emission lines and the optical to x - ray continuum observed through a column of gas and dust of density n@xmath3 @xmath4 . in this model ,",
    "the absorption is located in a dusty torus at parsec distances from the central continuum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "large variations of the obscuring screen are therefore not expected on timescales much shorter than the crossing time at the dust sublimation radius ( r@xmath5@xmath64@xmath7l@xmath8t@xmath9 cm , where l@xmath10 is the ultraviolet luminosity in units of 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath12 and t@xmath13 is the grain evaporation temperature in units of 1500 k , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite found that 23/24 x - ray absorbed ( compton `` thin '' , i.e.n@xmath14 @xmath4 ) agns showed n@xmath15 variability by a factor 2 - 3 , and , most interestingly , that several objects varied on timescales of months ( but see the case of ngc 4388 for even shorter variability timescales : @xcite ) , implying a limit to the distance r of the absorber from the x - ray source of @xmath16 cm .",
    "therefore @xcite suggested that the absorber might be located in cool clouds present in an accretion disk wind on the scale of the broad emission line region ( belr ) .",
    "this echoes the model of @xcite , which predicts n@xmath15 variability down to a timescales of days .",
    "variations of the overall level of the absorption may also be expected in the case of an ionized absorber responding to variations of the continuum level ( see e.g nicastro et al . 1999 , schurch & warwick  2002 ) .",
    "an accurate analysis of the temporal behaviour of the x - ray absorber can help us to gain precious information on its physics , size , geometry and location .",
    "unfortunately , this has been possible so far in a handful of cases only ( e.g. ngc  4388 , elvis et al .",
    "2004 , ngc  1365 , risaliti et al .",
    "2005 , mkn  348 , smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , because of the strong parameter degeneracy in complex , multi - component spectral fittings , in particular between the absorber and the continuum parameters .",
    "high statistics , broad - band observations are crucial to remove this degeneracy . to this purpose , we have analyzed two bepposax long ( elapsed time @xmath0 days ) observations of the bright seyfert galaxy , ngc 4151 , which are particularly well suited to further investigate this issue . in this paper",
    "we focus on the search for variability of the absorber on timescales from a few tens of ksec to years .",
    "ngc 4151 is one of the brightest seyfert galaxy in the sky in the x - ray band , and for this reason it has been studied in detail by all x - ray missions since the discovery of its x - ray emission in the 1971 @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic continuum has historically been parameterizered by an absorbed power law , with variable intensity and photon index ( @xmath17 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a strong narrow iron k@xmath18 line is present in the spectrum .",
    "this line has an intensity of 1.8@xmath7 10@xmath19 ph @xmath4 s@xmath12 ( hetgs ( i.e. high - energy transmission grating spectrometer , @xcite ) @xcite ) .",
    "the narrow core of the line is unresolved , with fwhm@xmath202000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the fe k@xmath18 intensity remains constant over short - medium ( days - months ) timescales and varies by @xmath21 on timescales of about one year ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these timescales suggest that the fe k@xmath18 line arises in a region at a distance r@xmath22 cm from the nucleus .",
    "a compton reflection component has been detected in the spectrum of ngc 4151 by @xcite , @xcite . at energies above 50 kev",
    "the continuum becomes steeper , and this change in slope can be modelled by an exponential cut - off with e - folding energy of 70@xmath23250 kev ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the nuclear power - law spectrum is heavily absorbed at e@xmath24 6 kev by a photoelectric absorption due to a large amount of material along the line of sight ( n@xmath15@xmath25 10@xmath26@xmath2310@xmath27 @xmath4 ) .",
    "a single absorber does not provide a good fit , as recognized since the first einstein observations ( sss , @xcite )",
    ". a better description of the spectrum is provided by an inhomogeneous absorber , which allows some fraction of the nuclear x - ray continuum to emerge with significantly less attenuation than the rest of the continuum .",
    "both a partial covering absorber ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and an ionized absorber ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have been proposed in the past .",
    "part of the emission is due to extended kpc - scale emission associated with the narrow line region ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , changes of the absorbing screen(s ) on timescales of days to years have been often reported in the past ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , schurch & warwick  2002 ) .",
    "these changes have been interpreted in terms of creation and destruction of cold filaments and clouds in the belr @xcite , or in terms of their orbital motion ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the inhomogeneous absorber consists of a large number of discrete clouds , each much smaller than the size of the x - ray source .",
    "the number of the clouds that , at any time , cover a given line of sight is distributed according to the poisson statistics .",
    "column density variations , in this scenario , are simply due to statistical fluctuations of the number of clouds along the line of sight . the thickness and size of the absorbing clouds",
    "can therefore be estimated by measuring amplitude and timescales of the column density variations . in models of a partially ionized absorber",
    "the variations in the underlying ionizing continuum change the optical depth of the absorber along the light of sight and so simulate a change in equivalent h column density , when the spectra are modelled with a neutral absorber . in this scenario ,",
    "schurch & warwick ( 2002 ) interpret the spectral variability observed in a asca long look in terms of changes of the ionization state in response of variations of the underlying continuum flux .",
    "this interpretation relies on the assumption of a constant underlying continuum shape , evaluated using a broad - band bepposax observation . in this paper",
    "we report on further bepposax observations which reveal changes in the obscuring column density on timescales of a few days , which strongly constrain the geometry of the absorber .",
    "thanks to the high statistics and broad spectral coverage we were able for the first time to investigate the nature of the observed variability without resorting on any a - priori assumption on the continuum emission .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : section 2 gives some details on the data reduction , section 3 illustrates the method used for the data analysis and presents the results of the temporal and spectral analysis , section 4 is devoted to the discussion of our results and conclusions .",
    "to look for changes in the absorber(s ) of ngc  4151 and to further investigate on its origin and geometry , we have selected the two longest observations performed with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( table 1 ) , lecs ( 0.1 - 10 kev , @xcite ) , mecs ( 1.3 - 10 kev , @xcite ) and pds ( 13 - 200 kev , @xcite ) , which have good sensitivity from 0.1 to at least 100 kev . because of the complexity of the spectrum , an energy coverage as broad as possible is the key to obtain a good constrain on the absorption models .",
    "the first observation was performed between 1996 july 6 and 9 for a total elapsed time of @xmath28 ksec . during the observation the 2 - 4 kev flux increased by a factor @xmath253 , and therefore this observation is particularly well suited to search for spectral variability . the second observation was a target of opportunity observation ( too ) performed between 2001 december 18 and 20 , for a total elapsed time of @xmath29 ksec , during a ngc  4151 outburst in the soft x - rays .",
    "this outburst was serendipitously detected by the bepposax wide field cameras , and a too observation of the source with the narrow field instruments was promptly performed . in this observation",
    "the signal to noise is particularly good and allows us to search for small spectral variation , and for variation on short timescales .",
    "the 1996 july observation was performed with mecs units 1 , 2 and 3 , while the 2001 december observation was performed with mecs units 2 and 3 only ( on 1997 may 6 a technical failure caused mecs unit 1 to be switched off ) ; data from the units were combined after gain equalization .",
    "the lecs was operated during dark time only , therefore lecs exposure times are smaller than mecs ones .",

    "we have analyzed two long ( elapsed time @xmath0 days ) bepposax observations of ngc 4151 searching for variability of the absorber on timescales from tens of ksec to years .",
    "we find significant low energy spectral variations in the softness ratio light curves of both observations suggesting that the absorption changed during the observations .    to characterize the spectral variability we used three models as a parameterization of the absorption : a ) a partial covering absorber plus a uniform absorber , both neutral ; b ) one neutral absorber and one ionized absorber both covering the nucleus totally ; and c ) one ionized absorber covering the nucleus totally and one neutral absorber covering the nucleus only partly .",

    "they are also smaller than those in the 1996 july c and d intervals .",

    "the covering factor in the 2001 december observation appears lower than in all other historical observations with similar 2 - 10 kev flux .",

    "the partial covering model is a convenient parameterization , but does not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "a more physical model is the clumpy absorber of holt et al .",
    "( 1980 ) . in this model",
    "the absorbing medium is composed of a large number of small clouds , the column density of an individual cloud being n@xmath45 and the mean number of clouds along a particular line of sight being @xmath46 @xcite . in this scenario , the observed variations of the column density are due to poissonian fluctuations of the number of clouds , @xmath46 .",

    "+ during the 1996 july observation the largest variation of the column density is @xmath57 @xmath4 on timescales as short as @xmath58 days .",
    "this timescale has strong implications for the location of the obscuring matter . assuming that the absorbing medium is made by spherical clouds moving with keplerian velocities around the central black hole ( m@xmath59 , @xcite ) , and identifying the above @xmath58-day timescale with the crossing time of a cloud",
    ", the absorbing medium would be located at the distance from the nucleus , r @xmath60r@xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the density in units of 10@xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the timescale in units of two days and r@xmath61 is the schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
    "if the x - ray absorber has a density typical of the clouds in the belr , 10@xmath66@xmath53@xmath67@xmath5310@xmath68 @xmath64 , then it would be located at a distance from the nucleus 340 r@xmath61@xmath53r@xmath533.4@xmath69r@xmath61 .",
    "this range includes the distance of the belr , as inferred from reverberation mapping of the h@xmath70 , civ , mgii and h@xmath71 line ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and from theoretical estimates of the outer radius of the belr ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the x - ray absorber lies in the parsec scale dusty molecular torus ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , its density would be @xmath72 @xmath64 .",
    "the x - ray absorber would then be a very compact slab ( thickness @xmath73 r@xmath61 , i.e. @xmath74 ) at parsec distance from the nucleus , which is a physically unlikely structure .",
    "we then conclude that the most likely location of the x - ray absorber is within the belr . if the clouds absorbing the x - rays are pressure - confining by a hot medium surrounding the belr , this confining gas would produce a thermal emission . interpreting the 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of the thermal bremsstrahlung during the december 2001 observation ( @xmath2510@xmath75 ) , as due to this confining gas ,",
    "the size of the region containing the thermal gas is 1@xmath710@xmath76 t@xmath77 n@xmath78 r@xmath61 , where t@xmath79 and n@xmath79 are the temperature and the density in units of 10@xmath80 k and 10@xmath80 @xmath64 respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the distance from the nucleus of the belr , and therefore a pressure - confining medium can not be excluded .",
    "variations of the x - ray absorber on timescales of days are expected in the model proposed by @xcite for type 1 agn and extended to type 2 agn by @xcite . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "a wind arises vertically from a narrow region on the accretion disk and it is then radially accelerated by the radiation pressure ( murray et al .",
    "1995 , kartje , knigl & elitzur 1999 ) .",
    "the wind is both warm ( @xmath2510@xmath81 k ) and highly ionized , with a density @xmath82 @xmath64 , which puts it in pressure equilibrium with the belr clouds .",
    "the belr is then a cool phase embedded in the wind and absorbing the x - rays coming from the nucleus . in the wind model",
    "the x - ray absorber is axisymmetric , like the torus , but the typical size and dynamic state in the two cases are quite different . in particular the x - ray absorber",
    "is located a few light days from the nucleus , then changes of the column density and/or of the covering factor are naturally expected on timescales greater than a few days .",
    "@xcite have found a factor of 100 decrease in the column density toward the normally almost compton - thick ( @xmath830.1 - 0.3 ) type 2 agn ngc 4388 on timescales either @xmath25 2 days or 4 hr , thus giving further support to the `` wind '' model .",
    "such model naturally predicts an absorber made by a cold and a warm phase .",
    "we tested this scenario through our models b and c. the best fit ionization parameters are roughly in the range found by schurch & warwick ( 2002 ) .",
    "although the behaviour of the ionization parameter in model b is nicely consistent with the expectations , with the absorber ionization parameter @xmath84 roughly correlated with the intrinsic flux , the results are not satisfactory from the statistical point of view , indicating that the physical and geometrical structure of the absorber is more complex than any of our simple parameterizations .",
    "model c , similar to that proposed by piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) produces best fit ionization parameters consistent with zero in all cases , thus reproducing model a. in particular , our time dependent spectral analysis does not confirm the piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) claim of a significant highly ionized iron absorption feature .",
    "therefore a word of caution is necessary concernig the presence of a relativistic outflow in this source .    to better locate the x - ray absorber , long monitoring of the source with instruments with good energy resolution and high sensitivity ( to collect high quality spectra in a few thousands of seconds )",
    "are needed .",
    "simultaneous optical monitoring of the source would allow us to search for dust features , and therefore to understand how much dust lies in the region occupied by the x - ray absorber .",
    "simultaneous x - ray and optical - uv spectroscopy could also be used to investigate whether broad emission lines emerge when the column density of the absorber along the line of sight is decreasing .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy on short timescales ( @xmath73 ksec ) could also be used to determine whether the change of the absorbing column is step - wise ( as expected for discrete clouds with sharp edges ) or more continuous , by giving a measure of the fuzziness of the clouds ( i.e. their column density gradients )",
    ".    recently , de rosa et al . ( 2007 ) reported a time resolved spectral analysis of the 1996 july observation , finding significant variations of the complex absorber on timescales similar to those found in this paper .",
    "de rosa et al .",
    "also note , in agreement with our findings , that the level of absorbtion during the 2001 december obervation is one of the lowest ever recorded , an episode during which the source was unusually uncovered .",
