    ", this value is exceedingly small  indeed much smaller than the cmb temperature ; it is therefore unlikely that hawking radiation will ever be measured directly ( at least in the astrophysical context . )    but what if one could get very close to a hole ?",
    "what would hawking radiation look like _ there _ ?",
    "unruh asked this question in his celebrated `` notes on black hole evaporation '' @xcite , where he showed that the correct answer depends on the observer s state of motion : the temperature measured by a particle detector close to the horizon is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the detector s acceleration .",
    "consequently , according to unruh , `` a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the hawking flux of particles '' @xcite . because the near - horizon of a sufficiently massive black hole is almost flat , and the quantum vacuum is as regular there as anywhere else , it is indeed natural to assume that `` nothing special '' happens to geodesic observers at the horizon .    yet",

    "@xcite , the devil is in the information conservation principle : for hawking radiation to be in a pure state , something `` dramatic '' must happen at the horizon .",

    "these new arguments are both exciting and challenging , but let s face it : they are mere speculations . to this day , neither the physics of trans - planckian fluctuations nor the fate of unitarity in quantum gravity are properly understood ; drawing dramatic consequences from them is bold , but risky . what _ is _ well understood , on the other hand , is quantum field theory in curved spacetimes  the very setup used by hawking to make his prediction . what does the old semi - classical framework have to say about alice falling into a black hole ?",

    "is needed : the two - point function @xmath21 of the field in the in - vacuum .",
    "the in - vacuum state is best described in terms of what may be called `` eikonal coordinates '' @xmath26 .",
    "these are globally defined , null coordinates , defined for a given spacetime point @xmath6 by tracing back to past null infinity @xmath12 the two radial null rays which meet at @xmath6 ; the coordinates @xmath27 are the eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath28 of these rays on @xmath12 , see fig .",

    "this property does not hold in higher dimensions , or with massive fields , but for the argument made in this essay , it is key .",
    "let us now ask : when will either of the two contributions @xmath33 to the response function corresponding to the incoming ( @xmath34 ) and outgoing ( @xmath35 ) modes respectively  be thermal ? there is a simple criterion for this @xcite : it suffices that , along the trajectory @xmath19 , the quantity ( dot denotes @xmath36 ) [ quasi ] t_=|| is approximately constant , in which case @xmath33 is a thermal spectrum at temperature @xmath37 . here , by `` approximately constant '' i mean @xmath38 .",
    "when this condition does not hold , a weaker form `` thermality '' of @xmath33 still holds in the ultraviolet limit , namely @xmath39 for @xmath40 .    in the case of asymptotic inertial trajectories with @xmath41 , as in hawking s original work , one checks that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "( this is consistent the lore that hawking radiation consists of those modes which have bounced off the center of the shell and escaped from it just before it forms a horizon at @xmath44 ) .",
    "more generally , if @xmath45 , viz .",
    "for inertial observers moving towards the hole at velocity @xmath46 , one computes @xmath47 and t^_-(e)=t_h(e+ ) .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent correction is the doppler factor for an observer moving relative to the a static source located on the center of the black hole .    ,",
    "both in the asymptotic limit ( `` asymp '' ) and at the horizon ( `` hor'').,title=\"fig : \" ] , both in the asymptotic limit ( `` asymp '' ) and at the horizon ( `` hor'').,title=\"fig : \" ]    but what are the values of when the radial geodesic @xmath19 crosses the horizon  that is , when alice jumps into the hole ?",
    "an explicit computation detailed in @xcite shows that , when she crosses the schwarzschild horizon , t^_-(e)=4et_ht^_+(e)=. thus , if alice enters the hole with sufficiently low radial velocity , in the sense that @xmath48 , ( with @xmath49 corresponding to the limit case where she is dropped from the horizon with zero initial velocity ) , she perceives the _ incoming _ modes at _ high temperature _ ! this divergence is confirmed by the computation of the ( outgoing ) _ flux _",
    "@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-velocity of alice and @xmath53 is a unit vector normal to @xmath51 : at horizon - crossing , this flux reads @xcite ^(e)=t_h^2(2e^2 + ) .",
    "thus , the intensity of hawking radiation perceived by freely - falling observers near the horizon can in fact be arbitrarily high .",
    "observer moreover that the velocity - dependence of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is _ not _ of doppler - type  at least not with respect to a single source inside the black hole .",
    "what is going on ? in short  the hawking effect , in reverse .",
    "the mechanism for the conversion of vacuum fluctuation into thermal radiation in the standard hawking effect ( observed from infinity ) is well known : it is the _ exponential redshift _ experienced by outgoing modes on their way from the to -",
    "be horizon to infinity .",
    "this is evident from our criterion : if @xmath56 is constant , then by integration @xmath57 is an exponential function of @xmath20 .",
    "now , for a near - horizon observer , it is clear that outgoing modes have had no chance to experience such exponential redshift .",
    "indeed , this is precisely what unruh understood in @xcite , and what led him to conclude that a near - horizon observer will not see the hawking flux of radiation .",
    "but one must not forget that the field also contains incoming modes !",
    "these modes , coming from infinity all the way down to the horizon , _ do experience a very large frequency shift_an exponential blueshift .",
    "this is why @xmath58 is not zero on the horizon , and this is also why @xmath59 have a non - dopplerian dependence on alice s velocity with respect to the hole : in the @xmath49 limit , the `` source '' is infinity  not the hole .",
    "limit contributed _ positively _ to the outgoing flux @xmath60 . ]    already at the purely classical level , it is well - known that in her free - fall approach to the black hole horizon , alice will feel the sky `` falling down '' on her head : when looking in the direction transverse to her radial motion , she will see an image of the entire sky compressed in a thin layer just above horizon .",
    "the near - horizon hawking effect discussed in this essay is reminiscent of this ( apparent ) inversion effect : seen from a radially infalling geodesic , asymptotic infinity and the horizon itself appear _ dual _ to one another , with the outgoing field modes mapped to the incomes modes and the large @xmath0 regime to the small @xmath0 regime .",
    "explicitly , t_+^(e/2)~t_-^(1/e)e0 .",
    "this identity is , i believe , a rather remarkable feature of hawking radiation .",
    "one may object that this `` horizon - infinity duality '' is imperfect .",
    "first , @xmath61 , while @xmath42 ; second , the thermality of incoming modes is not perfect ( because @xmath62 , but rather @xmath63 , hence thermality holds for high - frequency detectors only ) ; and third , because the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath64 and of @xmath65 holds only for @xmath48 and @xmath66 .",
    "one reason for this asymmetry is clear : the local spacetime geometry at infinity and on the horizon are not the same  the former is flat , the latter is not .",
    "suppose however that instead of the schwarzschild spacetime , we considered an artificial black hole geometry in which both infinity _ and _ the horizon are flat ( it is easy to design such a metric and repeat all computations using it instead of schwarzschild@xcite )",
    ". then the local geometries at infinity and on the horizon would be the same , and computing @xmath37 in both limits would lift the first caveat .",
    "i do not know whether the other two caveats are of importance .",
    "after many years of work on the hawking phenomenon , the nature of hawking radiation at the horizon  the fact that it appears to be emitted from _",
    "outside _ the hole , and can have _ high _ temperature  still surprises us today .",
    "not only is it not always true that `` nothing special '' happens on the horizon , but one needs not go beyond the semiclassical approximation to find some drama near the horizon .",
    "i have attempted to account for this effect by what i called the `` horizon - infinity duality '' : the idea that the hawking effect at the horizon is a reversed image of the standard hawking effect , where the role of ingoing and outgoing modes , and large - energy and small - energy geodesics , are reversed .",
    "the emerging picture is intriguing : for alice dropped just above the horizon , it s not the black hole that looks like a blackbody ",
    "it s the sky .",
    "i thank thanu padmanabhan for drawing my attention to the fate of infalling detectors with regards to hawking radiation , suprit singh for the collaboration leading to @xcite , and carlo rovelli and antonin coutant for several useful discussions on black hole physics .",
