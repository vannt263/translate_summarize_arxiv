    "several highly - collimated molecular outflows driven by deeply - embedded young stellar objects are known to have an extremely - high velocity ( ehv ) flow component , with terminal velocities of 50150kms@xmath9(e.g .",
    "these ehv components are closely confined to the axes of the lobes and have large momenta , comparable to those of the slowly - moving ( 2030kms@xmath9 ) `` classical '' outflows . as a result , it is felt that the ehv flow is closely connected with the `` primary jet '' responsible for driving the broader molecular outflow .",
    "the hh211 outflow ( d@xmath3315pc ) was discovered via near - infrared h@xmath4 imaging @xcite and is an archetypal outflow with a highly - collimated ehv jet .",
    "the outflow is driven by a low - luminosity ( 3.6@xmath10 ) class  0 protostar ( @xmath11@xmath333k ) and is thought to be extremely young ( @xmath12@xmath3750yr ) .",
    "the co @xmath0=21 images of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gg99 ) with a spatial resolution of 1.5@xmath2 show remarkable features : the low - velocity co delineates a pair of cavities whose tips are associated with the near - infrared h@xmath4 emission , while the high - velocity co traces a narrow jet whose velocity increases linearly with distance from the star . in spite of a small opening angle of 22@xmath13 ,",
    "the co @xmath0=21 emission from the cavity appears on both sides of the central star at velocities close to the systemic velocity of @xmath14=9.2kms@xmath9 , implying that the outflow axis lies within 10@xmath15 of the plane of the sky .",
    "the jet component ( but not the cavity ) is also traced by thermal sio emission , in @xmath0=10 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cr01 ) , @xmath0=54 @xcite , @xmath0=87 and @xmath0=1110 @xcite transitions . since these lines have critical densities larger than @xmath16@xmath8 and the energy level of @xmath0=11 is higher than 100k , the detection of these sio lines means that the jet is much denser and warmer than the lower - velocity cavity component .",
    "the observations of the sio @xmath0=54 transition at 217.105ghz were carried out on january 30 , 2004 with the six antennas of the submillimeter array ( sma ) on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite .",
    "we used an extended array configuration that provides baselines ranging from 17 m to 179 m .",
    "the primary - beam size ( hpbw ) of the 6 m diameter antennas at 217ghz was measured to be @xmath354@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in order to cover the whole outflow ( @xmath390@xmath2 along the major axis ) , we observed three fields separated by 25@xmath2 along the major axis of the outflow ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the spectral correlator was set to provide a uniform frequency resolution of 406.25khz across a 2ghz wide band .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated using the mir package , with 3c84 used as a phase and amplitude calibrator , and ganymede and titan as flux calibrators : uncertainty in the flux scale is estimated at @xmath320% .",
    "the bandpass was calibrated by observations of jupiter or saturn .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were imaged using miriad , followed by a non - linear joint deconvolution using the clean - based algorithm , mossdi , with robust weighting of 0.5 providing a synthesized beam of 1.6@xmath10.9@xmath2 at a position angle of @xmath1741@xmath13 .",
    "a continuum map was obtained by averaging the line - free channels of both sidebands separated by 10ghz , this time with natural weighting providing a synthesized beam of 1.7@xmath10.9@xmath2 at a position angle of @xmath1744@xmath13 .",
    "figure 1 shows a compact 220ghz continuum source at @xmath18 = 03@xmath1943@xmath2056.79@xmath21 , @xmath22 = 32@xmath1300@xmath2350.0@xmath2 ( j2000.0 ) with a peak flux of @xmath373mjy beam@xmath9 ( 12@xmath24 ) and a total integrated flux of @xmath3200mjy .",
    "this latter flux is approximately 70% of the 230ghz flux measured by using similar baselines ( 24180 m ) to ours , and it is likely that the relatively poor sensitivity of our measurements ( @xmath25@xmath36.2mjybeam@xmath9 ) failed to recover all of the low - level emission seen in the higher sensitivity ( @xmath25@xmath33mjybeam@xmath9 ) data of .",
    "a new , deep near - infrared image of hh211 was obtained using the isaac instrument of the eso very large telescope at paranal , chile on january  4 , 2002 under clear conditions .",
    "images were taken through a 1% wide filter centered on the v=10 s(1 ) line of h@xmath4 at 2.122@xmath26 m .",
    "a 2@xmath62 position mosaic was used to cover a 5@xmath65 arcmin region centered near hh211-mm at an image scale of 0.148 arcsec / pixel . in the central , fully - overlapping region ,",
    "the total integration time was 8minpixel@xmath9 after mosaicing .",
    "the data reduction was standard , including the subtraction of a blank sky image made from a median - filtered stack of the source images and flat fielding using a sequence of twilight - illuminated images .",
    "the data were corrected for the small geometric distortion in isaac using the coefficients determined from images of m16 by @xcite , before being aligned and mosaiced . despite a mean airmass of 1.9 , the resulting resolution is 0.60 arcsec fwhm and accurate astrometry ( 0.10 arcsec rms ) was derived from 17 stars in common with the 2mass point source catalog . an approximate flux calibration yields a 3@xmath24 surface brightness limit of @xmath27wm@xmath28pixel@xmath9 .",
    "the central portion of this new image shown in greyscale in figure  1 well delineates the key structures in the outflow , including the knots along the central axis and the excavated cavity ( part of which is continuum emission as shown in figure 1 of @xcite ) outside them .",
    "sio @xmath0=54 emission was detected from hh211 in two velocity ranges from @xmath1724kms@xmath9 to @xmath174kms@xmath9 ( blueshifted ) and from + 4kms@xmath9 to + 32kms@xmath9 ( redshifted ) with respect to the systemic velocity of @xmath14=9.2kms@xmath9 .",
    "integrated intensity maps of the blueshifted and redshifted emission are shown in figure  1 and velocity channel maps at 4kms@xmath9 intervals are presented in figure  2 . the sio @xmath0=54 emission is seen to be concentrated exclusively in the jet - like narrow region along the outflow axis and there is no counterpart to the low - velocity cavity component seen in co @xmath0=21 .",
    "we have smoothed the sma map to a resolution of 22@xmath2 and compared it with the sio @xmath0=54 spectrum observed with the jcmt @xcite , finding that 80100% of the single - dish flux is recovered by the sma , despite the missing short spacing information .",
    "this confirms that almost all of the sio @xmath0=54 emission arises from a narrow jet .",
    "after deconvolution of the sma beam , the width of the sio @xmath0=54 jet is @xmath30.8@xmath2 ( @xmath3250au ) fwhm .",
    "it comprises a chain of knots each separated by @xmath334@xmath2 ( @xmath31000au ) , with five discrete knots ( r1r5 in fig .",
    "2 ) on the redshifted side and six ( b1b5 ) on the blueshifted side .",
    "knots b2b5 , r3 , and r4 all appear to have near - infrared h@xmath4 counterparts , while the lack of h@xmath4 emission coincident with b1 , r1 , and r2 is probably due to the very high extinction associated with the dense protostellar envelope as traced in h@xmath29co@xmath30 and nh@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the innermost knots , b1 and r1 , have no counterparts in sio @xmath0=10 or co @xmath0=21 .",
    "the blueshifted side of the sio @xmath0=54 jet ends near an h@xmath4 knot roughly 23@xmath2 to the east of the protostar and the redshifted side @xmath318@xmath2 to the west of the center .",
    "the sio @xmath0=54 does not not extend as far as the co @xmath0=21 jet observed by , terminating at features bi and ri ( marked on figure 1 ) , respectively : no sio @xmath0=54 is seen beyond these positions , even though our three - pointing mosaic covered almost the entire outflow .",
    "the lowest transition sio @xmath0=10 also terminates at bi and ri , and the implication is that beyond these points , the jet is no longer dense enough to excite sio emission .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that beyond bi and ri , the sio has been destroyed via chemical processing in shocks , as described by .",
    "an sio @xmath0=54 position - velocity diagram along the jet axis ( figure  3 ) shows a different velocity structure to that seen in co @xmath0=21 . in particular , the sio @xmath0=54 exhibits a large velocity dispersion at the innermost knots b1 and r1 , suggesting that these knots are kinematically distinct from those in the outer part . at @xmath32@xmath2 ( @xmath3630au ) from the protostar ,",
    "the velocity centroid and the terminal velocity reach @xmath518kms@xmath9 and @xmath3230kms@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the outer part of the sio @xmath0=54 shows a hubble - like velocity structure , previously seen for the co @xmath0=21 .",
    "however , the sio jet is moving @xmath35kms@xmath9 faster than the co jet , reaching a maximum radial velocity of @xmath335kms@xmath9 . assuming that the axis of the flow is inclined by @xmath310@xmath13 out of the plane of the sky , the deprojected outflow velocity in the jet would correspond to @xmath3200kms@xmath9 , typical of the velocity of the primary jet driven by low - mass stars .    in figure  4",
    ", we compare line profiles of the sio @xmath0=54 at knots b1 , r1 , b4 , and r3 , with those observed in @xmath0=10 with the vla by . in order to obtain line intensity ratios ( table  1 ) , we convolved the data cubes of the two transitions to an equal angular resolution of 1.6@xmath2 .",
    "then , to derive physical parameters in the jet as traced by sio emission , we carried out large velocity gradient ( lvg ) statistical equilibrium calculations following the method of @xcite . reported peak brightness temperatures of the sio @xmath0=10 of 54k and 47k in the redshifted and blueshifted gas , respectively , averaged over a 0.58@xmath10.43@xmath2 beam .",
    "these sio @xmath0=10 emission peaks correspond to the positions of r3 and b4 in our data , where the 54/10 ratio is seen to be @xmath32 .",
    "the lvg calculations suggest that a density of ( 0.51)@xmath610@xmath33@xmath8 , a temperature of 60120k , and an sio abundance @xmath34(sio ) of ( 0.51)@xmath610@xmath35 are required to satisfy both the lower limit of the sio @xmath0=10 brightness temperature and the 54/10 ratio . as no @xmath0=10 emission was detected at the innermost knots , b1 and r1",
    ", the 54/10 ratio must exceed 10 : in order to reproduce such ratios , the same density range of ( 0.51)@xmath610@xmath33@xmath8 is again required , but at a much higher gas kinetic temperature , in excess of 300500k .",
    "these density and temperature ranges for b1 and r1 agree with those derived from the higher-@xmath0 transition sio lines observed with a single - dish telescope @xcite and the high-@xmath0 co lines observed with the iso long wavelength spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the rim - brightened shapes seen in the near - infrared and co @xmath0=21 images suggest that the outflow lobes are the cavities filled with lower - density gas .",
    "since the mean density of the molecular cloud core in which hh211 lies is @xmath34@xmath610@xmath36@xmath8 @xcite , the density inside the cavities should be on the order of 10@xmath37@xmath8 or less .",
    "on the other hand , the sio jet along the lobe axis has a much higher density of ( 0.51)@xmath610@xmath33@xmath8 . the strong h@xmath4 emission observed in hh211 suggests that the shocks in this outflow are nondissociative c - shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and therefore , it is unlikely that this emission is coming from cavity gas which has been compressed by a factor of @xmath38500 from the ambient @xmath310@xmath36@xmath8 .",
    "rather , it is much more likely that the primary jet itself is has an intrinsically high density or that dense gas in the protostellar disk or envelope is being entrained by the primary jet . while the fwhm of the dense sio @xmath0=54 jet is @xmath30.8@xmath2 , the co @xmath0=21 jet was seen to be somewhat broader at @xmath31.5@xmath2 near the protostar and increasing up to @xmath33@xmath2 further out , and with a density of @xmath310@xmath39@xmath8 , roughly 50 times lower than seen in the sio .",
    "these results suggest that the jet has an axial structure , with the higher density ( @xmath3810@xmath40@xmath8 ) gas close to the axis surrounded by a sheath of less dense gas 10@xmath39@xmath8 .",
    "the hubble law velocity structure seen in figure 3 at @xmath41 from the source is predicted from shells driven by wide - angle winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , turbulent entrainment models require an acceleration region near the star followed by a deceleration region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and bow shock entrainment models show a broad range of velocities near the bow tips ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these do not explain the hubble low shown in figure 3 .",
    "the highly - collimated morphology of the sio @xmath0=54 jet can be explained as an on - axis density enhancement within the @xmath34-wind type of wide - opening angle wind @xcite .",
    "since the wide - angle wind model has large radial velocity component , this will explain the large velocity dispersion observed near the base ( at b1 and r1 ) combined with the jet - like density enhancement , which can not be explained by any other entrainment models .",
    "the density and velocity structures observed with the sma suggest that the highly - collimated jet traced by the sio @xmath0=54 is closely related to the primary jet .",
    "in particular , the innermost pair of knots , b1 and r1 , have a high density of @xmath3810@xmath40@xmath8 , a high temperature of @xmath38300500k , and a large velocity dispersion of 30kms@xmath9 , and quite plausibly represent the primary jet itself , immediately after being launched from the protostar / disk system .",
    "we wish to thank all the sma staff in hawaii , cambridge , and taipei for their enthusiastic help during these observations .",
