    "since the discovery of mssbauer effect spectroscopy more than half a century ago @xcite , superconductivity has been one of the states that has been investigated by this technique @xcite .",
    "although mssbauer spectroscopy is widely accepted as one of the most sensitive techniques in terms of energy resolution , it has not contributed significant insight to studies of conventional superconductors . after the discovery of cuprate high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , mssbauer spectroscopy was widely used for studies of these materials and reports of observation of some anomalies in the spectral parameters in the vicinity of the superconducting critical temperature ( t@xmath4 )",
    "@xcite were published . due to the absence of commonly available mssbauer nuclides in the cuprates ,",
    "most studies were accomplished either by partial substitution of copper atoms by @xmath0fe and/or @xmath5sn , or by using resonant isotopes of the rare earth metals , like @xmath6eu , which increases the degree of difficulty of the measurements and reduces the clarity of the results @xcite .",
    "recently , the discovery of iron - based superconductors , that naturally contain the common mssbauer nuclide , @xmath0fe , has triggered intense mssbauer studies of these superconductors @xcite .",
    "superconductivity in iron - pnictides is usually achieved by doping a magnetic parent compound with electrons or holes , or by application of chemical or physical pressure , and thereby , suppressing the magnetic order , suggesting that superconductivity and magnetism are closely related in this system . although there are some studies on iron - based superconductors , which state that mssbauer spectral parameters show anomalies near t@xmath4 , in these materials it is hard to attribute the variation of the hyperfine parameters observed by mssbauer spectroscopy to purely magnetic or purely superconducting origins @xcite .    in order to study possible variations of hyperfine parameters caused by the transition from the normal to the superconducting state in a conventional superconductor",
    ", we revisited lutetium - iron - silicide , lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 .",

    "hence , lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 can be considered as an ideal compound to investigate the variation of hyperfine parameters caused only by the superconducting transition without any complications associated by the absence of mssbauer nucleus and/or the presence of magnetism . to the best of our knowledge no detailed , temperature dependent , @xmath0fe mssbauer spectroscopy measurements were performed on this material so far , and our goal is to shed some light on the applicability of mssbauer spectroscopy for studies of conventional , albeit multigap superconductors @xcite .",

    "2 , there are no peaks associated with the @xmath14-fe or with the other impurity in the mssbauer spectrum , which means the unknown phase is either iron - free or , if contains iron , is below the resolution limit .",
    "consequently , the mssbauer spectra can be analyzed as a single - phase ( lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 ) spectra .",

    ", we can conclude that our sample is a bulk superconductor and can be considered as single phase for mssbauer measurements and analysis .        in the lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 crystal structure , there are two , nonequivalent , fe positions , fe@xmath40 and fe@xmath41 of 1 : 2 occupation .",

    "the nearest fe - fe distance for fe@xmath41 is 2.71  .",
    "the anisotropic environments of the fe atoms ensure nonzero electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor at both sites .",
    "hence , in analyzing the data , two doublets are expected .",

    "the temperature dependencies of the is corresponding to the two sites are very similar , and no anomalies can be observed around t@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) . the is values obtained from the fits includes contributions from both the chemical shift and the second - order doppler shift , which is known to increase convexly upon decreasing temperature , due to gradual depopulation of the excited phonon states .",
    "however , it should be constant at low temperature , because of the quantum mechanical zero - point motion .",
    "the chemical shift should not depend on temperature .",
    "the main contribution to this variation is from the second - order doppler shift , which is usually described by debye model : @xmath43 where c is the velocity of light , m is the mass of the @xmath0fe nucleus , and @xmath44 is is the temperature - independent part , i.e. the chemical shift .",

    "the magnitude of the qs is proportional to the @xmath46 component v@xmath47 of the efg tensor , which is composed of two contributions : ( v@xmath47)@xmath48 , from the ligand charges around the mssbauer nucleus , and ( v@xmath47)@xmath49 , from the valence electrons of mssbauer nucleus .",
    "usually , ( v@xmath47)@xmath48 is small and weakly dependent on temperature , whereas ( v@xmath47)@xmath49 is strongly temperature dependent . as can be seen from fig .",
    "the qs of two sites are both almost temperature independent , which indicates the qs is mainly determined by the contribution from the ligand charge distribution around the @xmath0fe sites .    in order to get a better understanding of the electronic origin of efg at the fe sites in lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 , a first - principles calculation was performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method as embodied in the wien2k @xcite .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) suggested by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe gga ) @xcite was employed for the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "once the electron densities are calculated self - consistently and with high accuracy , the efg tensor can be obtained from an integral over the non - spherical charge density .",
    "the principal component v@xmath47 for the 4d site is 2.25@xmath5010@xmath51v / m@xmath21 and asymmetry parameter @xmath52 = 0.457 ; the v@xmath47 for the 8h site is -1.16@xmath5010@xmath51v / m@xmath21 and @xmath53 = 0.307 , which qualitatively agree with experimental results .",
    "it is found that the @xmath54-@xmath54 and @xmath55-@xmath55 interactions mainly contribute to the efg of lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 and @xmath54- electrons is play a significant role for states far from the fermi energy whereas the @xmath55-@xmath55 interaction dominates around the fermi energy , which is similar to what is found for the iron - pnictides superconductors @xcite .",
    "the relative areas of the subspectra are determined by the proportion of the fe atoms on different lattice sites . as mentioned above , for lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3",
    ", the theoretical relative area of the two subspectra representing iron atoms at the 4d and 8h sites should be 33.3% and 66.7% . at rt",
    "the relative areas are close to expected value . however , as shown in fig .",
    "6 ( e ) as temperature decreases , the relative area values deviate from theoretical values gradually , with the relative area for the 4d site becoming even larger than that for 8h site at low temperature .",
    "this phenomenon may be related to the variation of the linewidth , @xmath19 , for the doublets corresponding to the two sites with reducing temperature . as shown in fig . 6 ( g ) ,",
    "the @xmath19 of 4d site increases slightly at lower temperature , but the @xmath19 of 8h site is almost constant during the whole temperature range .",
    "the slightly increase of @xmath19 of 4d site suggests the existence of instability at this lattice site at low temperature .      in mssbauer studies of superconductivity ,",
    "the variation of the total spectral area has also been the focus of discussion .",
    "there are number of reports showing a decrease of the spectral area near t@xmath4 due to the softening of lattice with the opening of superconducting gap in cuprates @xcite but to the best of our knowledge only one report on iron - pnictide superconductors @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of behavior reported : a rapid decrease near t@xmath4 @xcite ; and a pit - like decrease either around t@xmath4 or at higher temperature , serving as a precursor to t@xmath4 @xcite . at the same time",
    ", some publications noted a poor reproducibility of those observations in the cuprates @xcite . in our measurements , as can be seen in the fig .",
    "7 , for the s1 , we did not observe any abnormal variation around 6.1 k. to make sure we did nt miss any minor variation around t@xmath4 , we remeasured the mssbauer spectra of the same sample between 4.4 k to 10 k with higher density of the data points around 6.1 k for 48 h. surprisingly , for data set s2 , there is a sharp , 6% , decrease around 5.5 k. nevertheless , when we repeated the same measurement again , data set s3 , this phenomenon disappeared .",
    "the sharp spectral area change seen in data set s2 is , in our opinion , most likely an artifact .",
    "the feature in data set s2 occurs resolvably below t@xmath4 = 6.1 k with the very sharp and rather large jump occuring between spectra taken at 5.3 k and 5.7 k ( with spectra at 5.7 k , 6.0 k , and 6.3 k all having normalized areas near 1.0 ) .",
    "if this feature were associated with t@xmath4 , it should have occured either between 5.7 k and 6.0 k or between 6.0 k and 6.3 k. in addition , there are no corresponding anomalies in data set s2 s isomer shift , quadrupole splitting or relative areas ( as shown in fig . 6 ) . a simple explanation for such behavior could be , among others , some mechanical shift / rearrangement of the powder composing the absorber .",
    "this observation gives a warning that even in the measurement of iron - containing stoichiometric material , irreproducibilities / artifacts might exist and should be addressed appropriately .",
    "finally , we also fitted the temperature dependence of area under the two doublets line of s1 measurements with debye model : @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the recoilless fraction , which is proportional to the area for thin sample and e@xmath58 is the @xmath16-ray energy .",
    "this expression also allows to estimate the value of @xmath59 .",
    "we obtained the @xmath59 = 385(8 ) k which is very close to the 408 k obtained from the analysis of the low temperature specific heat capacity data and about 140 k less than the value estimated by temperature dependence of is .",
    "a similar difference was found earlier in studies of e.g. fese@xmath60te@xmath60 and @xmath0fe- doped yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath61 compounds @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by the fact the area reflects the average mean - square displacements , while is related to the mean - square velocity of the mssbauer atom .",
    "both quantities may respond in different ways to the lattice anharmonicities .",
    "in summary , we performed detailed @xmath0fe mssbauer measurements on lu@xmath1fe@xmath2si@xmath3 in the temperature range of 4.4 k to rt .",
    "the contributions from two fe crystallographic sites can be well distinguished by mssbauer spectra .",
    "the main contribution of efg in this compound comes from the lattice anisotropy and the first principles calculations yield the values of efg that qualitatively agree with the experiment .",
    "the debye temperature was estimated by the temperature dependence of specific heat capacity , spectral area and is .",
    "the @xmath59 obtained from temperature dependence of spectral area and heat capacity are very similar , but about 140 k smaller than the value estimated by the is variation with temperature .",
    "additionally , we did nt observe any obvious , abnormal variation of hyperfine parameters around t@xmath4 .",
    "two possibilities could lead to this result : the opening of the superconducting gap does nt bring variation of the environment at fe site at all ; the t@xmath4 of this system is too low , and mssbauer spectroscopy is not sensitive enough to detect the minute change .    x. m. was supported in part by the china scholarship council .",
