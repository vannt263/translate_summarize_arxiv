    "the carbon - hydrogen plastics are widely used in the experiments in high energy density physics .",
    "these materials are often applied as ablators in experiments on the inertial confinement fusion @xcite ( icf ) and laser - driven shock - wave measurements @xcite .",
    "the contrast improvement of intense laser pulses is another fruitful application of plastics @xcite .",
    "intense laser pulses ( @xmath8  w/@xmath9 ) are preceded by prepulses , caused by the amplified spontaneous emission .",
    "the intensity of the prepulse may be many orders of magnitude ( say , @xmath10 ) lower than the intensity of the main pulse .",
    "however , for the huge intensities of the main pulse ( @xmath11  w/@xmath9 ) , the prepulse is intense enough ( @xmath12  w/@xmath9 ) to damage the target significantly @xcite .",
    "one of the possible remedies is to place a film in front of the target @xcite .",
    "the prepulse creates plasma from the film , that reflects the prepulse radiation and , thus , protects the target .",
    "then the plasma produced from the film expands and , if the film thickness was chosen correctly , becomes transparent right before the arrival of the main pulse .",
    "the usage of the plastic film is particularly promising @xcite , because it yields lower fluxes of re - emitted x - rays which may also damage the target .    the numerical simulation is necessary to choose the correct thickness of the film .",
    "the intensity of the prepulse is low enough ( @xmath12  w/@xmath9 ) , so that the two - temperature hydrodynamic simulation may be applied to describe its action @xcite .",
    "the two - temperature hydrodynamic model @xcite requires the knowledge of the matter properties : two - temperature equation of state , optical characteristics ( complex dielectric function ) , thermal conductivity , electron - ion coupling .",
    "the necessity of this information stimulates experimental and theoretical research on matter properties . in this work we are focused on the theoretical investigation of thermodynamic , transport and optical properties of plastics .",
    "the matter of the film undergoes complicated evolution under the action of the prepulse @xcite . at first",
    "the matter is heated almost isochorically , the two - temperature effects are of significant importance at this stage .",
    "then the matter is compressed by the induced shock waves and the temperature grows even further .",
    "after that the matter expands and the temperature drops .",
    "different methods of simulation are applicable to obtain matter properties in different regions of phase diagram .",
    "the average atom model @xcite may be used to calculate matter properties at high temperatures and compressions .",
    "the model may be applied both for one - component @xcite and multi - component systems @xcite .",
    "the chemical plasma model may be employed to calculate matter properties at low densities @xcite .",
    "the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) simulation in conjunction with the kubo - greenwood formula is well suited to calculate matter properties during the near - isochoric heating . in this work",
    "we calculate the properties of plastics along the normal isochor via the latter approach .",
    "the qmd simulation based on the density functional theory ( dft ) was used in numerous works for the calculation of thermodynamic properties , including hugoniots @xcite and equations of state @xcite ( eos ) .    the qmd simulation together with the kubo - greenwood formula is also widely used to calculate transport and optical properties .",
    "this method was first applied in early works @xcite and then in well - known papers @xcite .",
    "since that time the kubo - greenwood formula was used to calculate transport and optical properties of many systems @xcite . in our previous works @xcite we have employed this technique to calculate transport and optical properties of aluminum .",
    "the carbon - hydrogen plastics have been also recently explored by the qmd technique .",
    "the research was mainly focused on the calculation of the principal hugoniots and the properties of plastics in the compressed state .",
    "the attention was also scattered among the plastics of various chemical compositions .",
    "the plastic of the effective composition c@xmath0h@xmath13 was investigated for icf applications @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic and transport properties ( including thermal conductivity ) were calculated at high temperatures from 5 to 40  ev and high densities from 7 to 9  g/@xmath1 .",
    "the plastic of the effective composition ch@xmath14 was explored recently @xcite with the same purpose .",
    "the eos was calculated for the wide range of densities from 1.8 to 10  g/@xmath1 and for the temperatures from 4 to 100  kk .",
    "polystyrene ( effective composition ch ) was explored in the papers @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite contains the calculation of the principal hugoniot for the compressions from 2 to 3.2 ; the information on the static electrical conductivity and reflectivity is also available .",
    "the principal hugoniot for the compressions from 1.25 to 2 is presented in the paper @xcite . in work",
    "@xcite , the principal hugoniot for the compressions from 1.85 to 3.9 is presented together with the reflectivity data .",
    "polyethylene ( effective composition ch@xmath0 ) and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene ) ( pmp , effective composition ch@xmath0 ) were investigated in the works @xcite .",
    "the principal hugoniot of polyethylene for compressions from 1.15 to 2.1 , the principal hugoniot of pmp for the compressions from 1.4 to 3.2 were calculated in the paper @xcite ; the work also contains the analysis of polyethylene structural properties under elevated temperatures and densities .",
    "the work @xcite covers the calculation of the principal hugoniot of polyethylene for the compressions from 1.25 to 1.7 ; the structural properties of polyethylene are also investigated .",
    "the paper @xcite contains the results on thermodynamic , transport and optical properties of plastics of the effective composition ch@xmath0 for the densities from 1 to 3  g/@xmath1 and temperatures from 1 to 4  ev ; the influence of aluminum impurities on the matter properties is investigated .",
    "the properties of plastics of the effective composition ch@xmath0 at the normal isochor 0.954  g/@xmath1 are necessary for the simulation of prepulse action on the plastic film @xcite .",
    "this composition and normal density correspond to the high - density polyethylene .",
    "the review of the previous works available above demonstrates the lack of the results on the plastic properties at the normal density .",
    "this motivated us to perform the current work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly discuss the calculation technique in sec .",
    "[ sec : technique ] .",
    "then we consider the technical parameters used during the calculation , including the creation of the initial configuration ( sec .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains obtained results on thermodynamic , transport and optical properties of ch@xmath0 plastics at the density 0.954  g/@xmath1 and temperatures from 5  kk up to 100  kk .",
    "then we analyse the results obtained ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the work @xcite is performed ; the results on the static electrical conductivity are explained by the investigation of electron dos .",
    "here we will present only the brief description of the computation technique .",
    "it was described in detail in our previous paper @xcite and earlier works @xcite .",
    "three main stages are included to the calculation : qmd simulation and calculation of the thermodynamic properties ; precise resolution of the band structure ; calculation of the transport and optical properties according to the kubo - greenwood formula .    at the first stage",
    "the atoms of carbon and hydrogen in the necessary proportion are placed to the supercell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the volume of the supercell is chosen to yield the correct density of plastic . at the initial moment",
    "the ions are placed to the auxiliary simple cubic lattice ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] for more detail ) ; the qmd simulation is used to calculate ionic trajectories in the further moments . at every step of qmd simulation the electronic structure",
    "is calculated by the dft approach via the solving of the kohn - sham equations .",
    "ions are treated classically , the forces acting on the ions are calculated at every step via the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "the temperature of electrons is determined by the parameter in the fermi - dirac distribution ; the temperature of ions is maintained by the nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "the qmd simulation is performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the vasp code provides the temporal dependences of the following properties : total energy of electrons and ions without kinetic energy of ions @xmath15 , kinetic energy of ions @xmath16 , total pressure of electrons and ions without kinetic contribution of ions @xmath17 , kinetic contribution of ions @xmath18 . when the simulation starts , these properties vary until equilibrium ( or at least metastable , see sec .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] ) section of md run is reached . at the equilibrium section of evolution",
    "the properties mentioned fluctuate around their equilibrium values . to obtain thermodynamic properties",
    "the temporal dependences are averaged over the equilibrium section .",
    "every step of the qmd simulation from the equilibrium section is used for averaging .",
    "thus we obtain thermodynamic values @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "then we may calculate the total energy of electrons and ions @xmath23 and the total pressure of electrons and ions @xmath24 . for the sake of convenience",
    "the energy obtained is divided by the total mass of the supercell , thus yielding the specific energy .",
    "thus we obtain the temperature dependence of energy @xmath25 , calculated at separate temperature points along the isochor .",
    "we compute the heat capacity @xmath26 performing numerical differentiation @xmath27 .",
    "the derivative is calculated as a half - sum of forward and backward finite - differences of the first - order accuracy .",
    "we compute both @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    at the second stage",
    "the precise resolution of the band structure is performed .",
    "we use much less number of ionic configurations for the calculation of the transport properties , than for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties .",
    "so we select only several ionic configurations from the equilibrium section of the md run . for these selected configurations",
    "we calculate the electronic structure . again , as well as during the qmd simulation , the kohn - sham equations are solved .",
    "though now we may use a larger cut - off energy , number of bands , number of * k*-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the higher values of these parameters increase the precision of calculation . at this stage",
    "we obtain energy eigenvalues , corresponding wave functions and occupation numbers ; this information is used at the third stage to calculate the dynamic onsager coefficients .",
    "precise resolution of the band structure is performed using the vasp package .    at the third stage",
    "the dynamic onsager coefficients @xmath29 are calculated for each ionic configuration according to the kubo - greenwood formula : @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electronic wave function and energy eigenvalue respectively , corresponding to the particular band @xmath33 and the point in the brillouin zone @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the fermi - weight of the particular band , @xmath36the weight of the particular * k*-point .",
    "@xmath37 is the chemical potential , @xmath38the frequency of the applied electric field , @xmath39the volume of the supercell , @xmath40 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath41 is the electron mass , @xmath42 stands for the temperature of electrons and ions here .    the delta - function in the kubo - greenwood formula ( [ eq : dynamiconsager ] )",
    "is broadened @xcite by the the gaussian function with the standard deviation @xmath43 .",
    "the intuitively clear derivation of the kubo - greenwood formula is present in paper @xcite , the derivation of the form ( [ eq : dynamiconsager ] ) with half - sum @xmath44 may be found in the work @xcite , additional discussion of the advantage of the formula with the half - sum is present in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we use the vasp module optics.f90 to calculate matrix elements @xmath45 .",
    "the optics.f90 module provides the correct calculation of the matrix elements with necessary corrections due to the usage of the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials taken into account .",
    "we have also created special parallel program module that uses matrix elements obtained from vasp to calculate the dynamic onsager coefficients according to the kubo - greenwood formula ( [ eq : dynamiconsager ] ) .",
    "the dynamic onsager coefficients calculated for different ionic configurations are averaged .",
    "the real part of the dynamic electrical conductivity @xmath6 is simply the @xmath46 onsager coefficient .",
    "no physical meaning is assigned to the other dynamic onsager coefficients .",
    "they are necessary only to obtain the static onsager coefficients @xmath47 via the extrapolation to the zero frequency : @xmath48 .",
    "the static electrical conductivity @xmath49 ; the thermal conductivity @xmath50 is expressed via the static onsager coefficients as follows : @xmath51 it should be mentioned , that @xmath50 contains the additional second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k_exact ] ) , called the _",
    "thermoelectric term_. it was shown theoretically @xcite and confirmed numerically @xcite , that for metals at relatively low temperatures the relative contribution of the thermoelectric term is rather small . in this work",
    "we check the relative contribution of the thermoelectric term to the thermal conductivity of plastics at different temperatures .",
    "the experimentally discovered wiedemann - franz law is valid for metals at low temperatures : @xmath52 the static electrical conductivity @xmath2 and the thermal conductivity @xmath53 may depend on the temperature , whereas the ratio @xmath54 , called the lorenz number , is a constant .",
    "the ideal degenerate value @xmath55  w@xmath56k@xmath57 may be justified theoretically for metals at low temperatures @xcite . if aluminum is exposed to elevated temperatures at first the wiedemann - franz law holds @xcite , but at even higher temperatures it is violated @xcite .",
    "it is not evident , whether the wiedemann - franz law is valid for plastics .",
    "however , sometimes @xcite the wiedemann - franz law is also used for plastics . in this work",
    "we obtain the static electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity in the _ ab initio _ calculation and check the wiedemann - franz law for plastics .",
    "we have also calculated electron dos . during the precise resolution of the band structure",
    "the information on the energy eigenvalues was obtained .",
    "the whole range of energy eigenvalues @xmath58 ( hereafter called the electron energy for simplicity ) was divided into the sections of @xmath59 width .",
    "the number of bands falling within each section was determined and divided by the width of the section .",
    "the obtained value @xmath60 was assigned to the electron energy at the middle of the section .",
    "each band was counted only once , i.e. the spin degeneracy was not taken into account .",
    "the results presented in this paper contain the values @xmath61 , where @xmath39 is the volume of the supercell .",
    "for the given material at the fixed density and temperature for each given energy @xmath58 @xmath61 remains almost ( neglecting small fluctuations ) fixed as the volume @xmath39 is varied .",
    "if we present results in the form @xmath61 we may compare the dos calculated for different numbers of atoms in the supercell .",
    "we could definitely use methods based on the gaussian smearing yielding the smoother curves @xmath61 ; however , in this work we use the simple method described above which is enough for the analysis .",
    "the bulk of our calculations was performed for 120 atoms ( 40 atoms of carbon , 80 atoms of hydrogen ) in the computational supercell .",
    "only several additional runs were made for 249 atoms to check the dependence on the number of atoms .",
    "we have chosen the qmd step to be 0.2  fs .",
    "such a small value ensures the stable work of the vasp package for different initial ionic configurations . at larger values of step , for some initial ionic configurations the kinetic energy of ions grows rapidly and",
    "the system becomes numerically unstable .",
    "the nos mass parameter smass is also an important technical parameter .",
    "we have set smass to 0 , thus we let vasp to set smass automatically .",
    "thus the smass parameter varied from 0.05 at 5  kk to 0.98 at 100  kk .",
    "if the smass parameter is too large , the kinetic energy of ions has a large period of fluctuations and it also takes significantly more time steps for the kinetic energy of ions to equilibrate .",
    "the initial ionic configuration should also be chosen with care . if we wanted to simulate a plastic in a solid phase we would have to put the ions in the realistic ionic configuration ; the long polymeric chains would have to be taken into account .",
    "this would also require a large computational cell , and therefore huge computational efforts .",
    "we are interested in the properties of plastic at higher temperatures , when all the polymeric chains and even chemical bonds are destroyed .",
    "thus we could put ions to the random positions at the initial moment and expect , that qmd simulation would produce correct ionic configurations during the simulation .",
    "however , if the ions are placed randomly , they may come arbitrarily close to each other .",
    "this leads to the rapid growth of the kinetic energy at the start of simulation and may cause the numerical instability at the large steps of simulation . to avoid these problems we construct an auxiliary simple cubic lattice and put ions of carbon and hydrogen to the random positions at the nodes of this auxiliary lattice .",
    "thus we restrict the lowest possible distance between the ions .",
    "if we choose the initial ionic configuration this way , the kinetic energy of ions grows more slowly at the start of simulation ; this makes the time necessary for equilibration of kinetic energy of ions lower .",
    "it also provides opportunity to increase the step of simulation ( though we keep it low at 0.2 fs ) .    at the start of simulation we put ions to the random positions at the nodes of the auxiliary simple cubic lattice",
    ". then we perform 15000 steps of simulation .",
    "given the simulation step is 0.2 fs , we track 3 ps of the system evolution .",
    "following the procedure of configuration generation described above , we need to know only the relative fractions of carbon and hydrogen .",
    "further in this paper we call this unordered state a",
    "_ plastic of the effective composition ch@xmath62_.    the setting of the initial ionic configuration of plastics for the qmd simulation is an involved problem ; the methods of its construction vary from quite simple to rather complicated .    in some works @xcite the initial configuration is not specified and only the average composition of the supercell is mentioned .    in other works @xcite the supercell is filled with some small molecules .",
    "ch@xmath0 molecules are placed to the random positions to set the initial configuration for polyethylene in the paper @xcite ; the problems of the molecules coming arbitrarily close to each other ( similar to our problems described above ) are encountered . in ref .",
    "@xcite the supercell is filled with the c@xmath63h@xmath63 units to set the initial configuration for polystyrene .",
    "the crystalline polyethylene structure may be obtained by placing ions to the polymeric chains inside the tetragonal supercell with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "such an approach has a drawback : this tetragonal phase of polyethylene has not been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the most complicated approach is to use a polymer builder program to construct some number of polymeric chains @xcite .",
    "then the supercell is exposed to several cycles of energy minimization and annealing to obtain the structure with the lowest energy @xcite .    in this work we use the simplest procedure described above to set the initial ionic configuration .",
    "we can not assert , that we reach a thermodynamically equilibrium state .",
    "but at least we can be sure that we explore a state , that is metastable during the simulation time .",
    "the previous works @xcite show , that the time of several picoseconds is quite sufficient for chemical bonds to break and form .",
    "this ensures that the simple procedure employed in this work is good enough to reasonably reproduce the properties of plastics .    during the qmd simulation",
    "we have used the local density approximation ( lda ) for exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the exchange part of the functional had a common @xmath64 dependence , whereas the correlation part had the ceperley - alder parametrisation @xcite .",
    "we have used paw pseudopotentials @xcite , 4 electrons per carbon atom and 1 electron per hydrogen one were included in the calculation . at the highest temperature of 100  kk we have also tried to include 6 electrons per carbon atom to the calculation .",
    "this only added 40 ( 2 electrons per band ) fully occupied bands which were located approximately 250  ev lower than other bands .",
    "these fully occupied bands apparently do not affect the behavior of other electrons .    during the qmd simulation we have used the energy cut - off @xmath65  ev and 1 * k*-point ( @xmath66-point ) in the brillouin zone .",
    "the number of bands increased as the temperature was increased ; the number of bands was selected as described in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the bands with the occupation numbers not less than @xmath67 were considered occupied .",
    "we have used configurations from 2500 to 12500 ( corresponding to time from 0.5  ps to 2.5  ps ) to average over the temporal dependences of energy and pressure .",
    "we have chosen 15 ionic configurations for the calculation of transport and optical properties : the first one was chosen at step 999 ( 0.2  ps ) ; the period between neighboring configurations was 1000 time steps .",
    "the precise resolution of the band structure was performed for each of the chosen ionic configurations .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional , the pseudopotential , the energy cut - off and the number of * k*-points during the precise resolution of the band structure were the same as during the qmd simulation . only the number of bands was increased to enable the calculation of optical properties for the frequencies up to 40  ev .",
    "the number of bands was selected as described earlier @xcite .",
    "the dynamic onsager coefficients were calculated for the frequencies from 0.005  ev up to 40  ev with the frequency step of 0.005  ev .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath68-function in the kubo - greenwood formula was @xmath69  ev . the simple linear extrapolation was used to obtain the static onsager coefficients from the dynamic ones ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the width of the sections @xmath59 during the calculation of dos should be selected the same way as the broadening @xmath43 in the kubo - greenwood formula ( see detailed description in our previous paper @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath59 should be small enough for the physical dependence on the dos curves not to be smoothed ; @xmath59 should not be too small , otherwise the oscillations will appear . in this work @xmath59",
