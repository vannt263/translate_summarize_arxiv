    "the key role of the gilbert parameter @xmath0 in current - driven@xcite and precessional@xcite magnetization reversal has led to a renewed interest in this important magnetic material parameter .",

    "the self - consistent born approximation theory for @xmath0 requires that ladder - diagram vertex corrections be included in the transverse spin - spin response function .",
    "since the born approximation is exact for weak scattering , we can use this comparison to assess the reliability of the simpler and more practical torque - correlation formula .",
    "we conclude that the torque - correlation formula is accurate when the gilbert damping is dominated by intra - band excitations of the transition metal fermi sea , but that it can be inaccurate when it is dominated by inter - band excitations .",

    "we conclude that @xmath0 can be evaluated relatively reliably when the intra - band contribution dominates .",
    "when the inter - band contribution dominates it is important to assess whether or not the dominant contributions are coming from bands that are nearby in momentum space , or equivalently whether or not the matrix elements which contribute originate from pairs of bands that are energetically spaced by much less than the exchange spin - splitting at the same wavevector .",
    "if the dominant contributions are from nearby bands , the damping estimate should have the same reliability as the intra - band contribution . if not , we conclude that the @xmath0 estimate should be regarded with caution .",
    "to summarize , this article describes an evaluation of gilbert damping for two simple models , a two - dimensional electron - gas ferromagnet model with rashba spin - orbit interactions and a four - band model which provides an approximate description of ( iii , mn)v of ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "our results are exact in the sense that they combine time - dependent mean field theory@xcite with an impurity ladder - sum to all orders , hence giving us leverage to make the following statements . first , previously neglected higher order vertex corrections become quantitatively significant when the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is larger than the exchange splitting .",
    "second , strong intrinsic spin - orbit interaction leads to the the supremacy of intra - band contributions in ( ga , mn)as , with the corresponding monotonic decay of the gilbert damping as a function of disorder .",
    "third , the spin - torque formalism used in _ ab - initio _ calculations of the gilbert damping is quantitatively reliable as long as the intra - band contributions dominate _ and _ the exchange field is weaker than the spin - orbit splitting ; if these conditions are not met , the use of the spin - torque matrix element in a life - time approximation formula offers no significant improvement over the original spin - flip matrix element .      30 for an introductory review see d.c .",
