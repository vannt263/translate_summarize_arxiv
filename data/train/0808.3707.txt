    "on the scale of individual galaxies and larger scales , general relativity requires large amounts of dark matter to describe the dynamics of cosmic structure .",
    "moreover , the late - time acceleration of the hubble expansion implies the existence of a cosmological constant , a special case of a dark energy fluid which is suggested by more sophisticated models ( see @xcite , for a review ) . in principle",
    ", we can avoid the dark matter and dark energy solutions to the puzzles posed by the astrophysical data by adopting an alternative theory of gravity , which reduces to general relativity in the appropriate limit . independently of the dark matter and dark energy problems ,",
    "a modification of general relativity is also highly desirable if we ultimately wish to unify gravity with the other fundamental interactions .",
    "possible modifications of the einstein - hilbert action proposed in the literature are , among others , ( i ) the introduction of additional scalar and/or vector fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( ii ) the assumption of arbitrary functions @xmath2 of the ricci scalar @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( iii ) the introduction of additional dimensions to the four dimensions of the general relativity spacetime manifold ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    a different approach was suggested by @xcite who revived weyl s theory @xcite as a possible candidate to solve the dark matter and dark energy problems .",
    "when the geometry is kept riemannian , with a null covariant derivative of the metric tensor , we can obtain a milder version of weyl s gravity , known as conformal gravity .",
    "in this theory , we impose a local conformal invariance on the gravitational field action in the curved four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the einstein - hilbert lagrangian density for the gravitational field is chosen on the requirement that the theory of gravity is a second - order derivative theory . in conformal gravity ,",
    "the lagrangian density is chosen on the principle of local conformal symmetry which is uniquely satisfied by the action @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the weyl tensor , @xmath6 is a coupling constant , and @xmath7 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath8 .",
    "conformal symmetry is garanteed by the invariance of the weyl tensor to local conformal transformations @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary conformal factor that can be specified by a spontaneous breaking of the conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "the theory of gravity implied by the action @xmath11 is a fourth - order derivative theory .",
    "the vacuum exterior solution for a static and spherically symmetric spacetime contains the schwarzschild solution @xcite .",
    "the weak - field limit is consistent with the solar system observational data @xcite , unlike claimed in previous investigations @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that conformal gravity can reproduce the rotation curves of disc galaxies without dark matter .",
    "moreover , conformal gravity can explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe without resorting to a fine - tuned cosmological constant or to the existence of dark energy @xcite .",
    "unlike the standard theory , where the universe starts accelerating at redshift @xmath12 , conformal gravity predicts that the universe is accelerating at all times .",
    "therefore , observational data probing the hubble plot at very high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) can be a decisive test .",
    "more recently , conformal theory has been proposed as a valid candidate for building a theory of quantum gravity @xcite ; in fact , theories based on fourth - order derivative equations of motion have had the long - lasting problem of suffering from the presence of ghosts .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that this erroneous belief is the result of considering the canonical conjugates @xmath13 of the generic dynamical variables @xmath14 , when the @xmath14 s are real , to be hermitian operators ; however , this assumption is incorrect , and when the non - hermiticity property of the hamiltonian of these higher - order quantum field theories is correctly taken into account , the states with negative norm disappear .    from an astrophysical perspective , however , the form of conformal gravity that has been proposed in the literature currently has two main shortcomings : the abundance of light elements , and the gravitational lensing phenomenology .",
    "conformal gravity nicely avoids the requirement of an initial big bang singularity , but it still predicts an early universe sufficiently dense and hot to ignite the light element nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , conformal gravity predicts a too slow initial expansion rate .",
    "this rate favours the destruction of most of the deuterium produced in the early universe @xcite and poses conformal gravity in serious difficulties compared to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "conformal gravity necessarily requires astrophysical processes for the production of the deuterium currently observed , for example neutron radiative capture on protons in the atmospheres of active stars @xcite or gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "however , the processes investigated to date do not seem to be efficient enough .",
    "for example , significant production of deuterium in the galaxy seems to be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the second open issue is the conformal gravity prediction of gravitational lensing .",
    "early investigations of gravitational lensing in conformal gravity @xcite show that , in the weak - field limit , the deflection angle due to a point mass @xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radius of the photon closest approach ; @xmath18 contains the additional term @xmath19 when compared to the general relativity result .",
    "the constant @xmath20 has to be positive to fit the galaxy rotation curves , thus implying a repulsive effect in gravitational lensing .",
    "it was later realized @xcite that the geodesics of photons are independent of the conformal factor @xmath10 and one can choose an appropriate conformal factor and a radial coordinate transformation to yield attractive geodesics for both massive and massless particles .",
    "however , in the strong - field limit , the light deflection might still be divergent or even impossible @xcite .",
    "until these open questions are completely settled , conformal gravity can not yet be considered ruled out by observations . moreover ,",
    "conformal invariance plays a crucial role in elementary particle physics and a viable theory of gravity that includes this property can at least be suggestive of a relevant route towards the unification of the fundamental interactions .    from the astrophysical point of view",
    ", conformal gravity can be further tested by investigating the formation of cosmic structure . to date",
    ", nobody has yet explored how the large - scale structure forms in conformal gravity .",
    "if structures form by gravitational instability , as in the standard theory , the development of a cosmological perturbation theory , which is still lacking , becomes inevitable . this theory would enable the comparison of conformal gravity with the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and would provide initial conditions for the simulation of the structure evolution into the non - linear regime .    before building up such a theory , however , it is useful to check whether conformal gravity is able to reproduce the equilibrium configuration of cosmic structures , other than galaxies , without dark matter .",
    "@xcite has already shown that , if we interpret the observational data of the intracluster medium of x - ray clusters by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , conformal gravity requires a factor of ten less baryonic mass than inferred from the x - ray surface brightness measures . here ,",
    "we extend this analysis by performing hydrodynamical simulations of self - gravitating gas clouds .",
    "we modify a standard tree+sph code to perform numerical simulations of self - gravitating systems in conformal gravity .",
    "the numerical tool we create is extremely relevant if we eventually wish to investigate the formation of the large - scale structure , because we will massively need to resort to numerical integrations when the evolution of the density perturbations reaches the non - linear regime .    in section [ sec : cg ]",
    ", we review the basic steps leading to the gravitational potential of a static point source in conformal gravity . in section [",
    "sec : sphere ] , inspired by the analysis of @xcite , we compute the gravitational potential energy of a spherical system , and in section [ sec : xray ] we use this result to compute the expected mean temperature and the temperature profile of the intracluster medium . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we derive the same results with hydrodynamical simulations of self - gravitating gas clouds .",
    "conformal gravity is a theory of gravity based on the action @xmath4 . for any finite , positive",
    ", non - vanishing , continuous , real function @xmath10 of the four spacetime coordinates @xmath21 , this theory is invariant for any conformal transformation @xmath9 , because the weyl tensor is invariant for these transformations .",
    "the variational principle applied to the action leads to fourth - order field equations , whose solution for the vacuum exterior to a static point source leads to the line element @xmath22 c^2 dt^2\\right .",

    ". the arbitrary function @xmath10 can be specified by a mechanism which breaks the conformal symmetry .",
    "@xcite implicitly assume @xmath26 .    according to this assumption , when @xmath27 , the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) reduces to the usual schwarzschild metric with @xmath28 , @xmath15 the gravitational mass of the point source and @xmath29 the gravitational constant .",
    "the term @xmath30 corresponds to a cosmological solution which is conformal to a robertson - walker background ; therefore , @xmath25 can be chosen small enough that it can be neglected on the scales of galaxies and galaxy clusters , and we will not consider this term hereafter .",
    "moreover , the rotation velocities of spiral galaxies suggest a value of @xmath20 sufficiently small that the terms proportional to @xmath31 can be safely ignored @xcite . equation ( [ eq : metric ] ) thus reduces to @xmath32 @xcite uses the observed rotation curves of eleven spiral galaxies of widely different luminosities to constrain @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite suggests the parametrization @xmath33 , where @xmath34  m@xmath35 and @xmath36  m@xmath35  m@xmath37 ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 should be two universal physical constants . in the following , we adopt a more convenient form of the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) suggested by @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42  kpc .",

    "the physical origin of this term is very subtle . unlike in newtonian gravity ,",
    "the presence of the linear term @xmath48 clearly prevents us from neglecting the contribution of distant objects to the acceleration of any body in the universe . according to @xcite , in conformal gravity the net effect of all the mass in the universe",
    "is to contribute a constant acceleration in addition to the acceleration due to a local source .",
    "@xcite shows that , with an appropriate coordinate transformation allowed by the conformal invariance , the mass in the universe exactly generates the additional linear potential @xmath49 , that we name the _ curvature _ potential .",
    "this argument implies that , to compute the gravitational potential energy of an extended source , we need to treat the _ curvature _ potential @xmath49 and the potential @xmath50 , originated by the local field source , separately . for the time being , let us consider this latter gravitational potential alone .",
    "consider an extended source .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of two of its mass elements with separation @xmath51 is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the part of the potential @xmath54 that depends on @xmath51 only .",
    "when we sum over all the mass elements , we get the total gravitational potential energy @xmath55 , namely @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass density distribution of the source and @xmath58 is the gravitational potential generated by its self - gravity alone .    the total potential energy @xmath59 can also be derived with a different argument which provides an alternative expression to equation ( [ eq : pot - pot ] ) . for a system of @xmath0 particles with position @xmath60 and mass @xmath61 , each feeling a force @xmath62",

    "finally , the ratio between the curvature potential and the conformal gravity potential due to the sphere self - gravity is @xmath126 ; therefore , @xmath111 is negligible when @xmath127 , as in our case , where @xmath128 , unless , of course , @xmath129 .",

    "this result agrees with the claim of @xcite that the acceleration provided by the conformal gravity potential is too intense .",
    "we now show that the disagreement with observations extends to the temperature profile , besides its normalization .",

    "this discrepancy is a simple consequence of the inconsistent approach we used to obtain equation ( [ eq : t - profile ] ) .",

    "we thus conclude that the values of the conformal physical constants @xmath165  kpc and @xmath166  m@xmath167 implied by the galaxy rotation curves provide x - ray clusters with average temperatures a factor of ten too large , and rising temperature profiles , clearly at odds with real clusters .",
    "to solve properly the coupled boltzmann and poisson equations and predict the correct x - ray properties of a galaxy cluster in conformal gravity , we run hydrodynamical simulations of isolated spheres of gas with a smoothed - particle - hydrodynamic ( sph ) code .",
    "we use a modified version of the publicly available gadget-1.1 code @xcite .",
    "the original version of gadget-1.1 is a tree+sph code which integrates the equations of motion of @xmath0 particles which interact gravitationally .",
    "the @xmath0 particles are a discrete representation of either a collisionless or a collisional fluid ; traditional simulations contain both collisionless and collisional particles which represent the dark matter and the baryonic fluids , respectively .    in our simulations",
    ", we only require the presence of the baryonic fluid and we only have collisional particles .",
    "moreover , in newtonian gravity , the potential between two particles decreases with the interparticle distance , and gadget-1.1 arranges the particles in a tree structure in order to average the contribution of distant particles to the local acceleration .",
    "this technique substantially decreases the time required to compute the acceleration of individual particles .",
    "unfortunately , in conformal gravity this technique can not be applied , because the gravitational potential contains a term that increases linearly with the interparticle distance , and the contribution of distant particles to the gravitational potential must be computed individually .",
    "we will therefore use gadget-1.1 as a direct @xmath0-body integrator .",
    "the computational cost thus increases with @xmath168 rather than @xmath169 . in appendix",

    "we simulate the evolution of isolated spherical clouds of gas with vacuum boundary conditions .",
    "we neglect radiative cooling . at the end of this section",
    "we discuss how simulating the gas physics more realistically can actually be relevant to find a way to alleviate the discrepancy between conformal gravity and the observed thermal properties of x - ray clusters .",
    "a gas cloud is represented by @xmath170 gas particles .",

    "we do not actually need a larger @xmath0 , because the aim of our simulations is to test the general viability of conformal gravity rather than the detailed physics of the intracluster medium , which would require higher spatial and mass resolutions .",
    "in fact , the current form of the conformal gravitational potential yields clusters so different from real clusters that running costly simulations is unwarranted .                the gas cloud initially has a @xmath1-model density profile @xmath171^{-3\\beta/2}\\;\\ ] ] and null thermal and kinetic energies .",

    ", we can not draw our conclusions without the following relevant cautionary tale .",
    "the results we show here derive from simulations that treat the gas adiabatically .",
    "in other words , we neglect radiative cooling and the gas heating processes due to astrophysical sources , as supernovae explosions , energy injection from active galactic nuclei , or galactic and stellar winds .",
    "these heating processes act at different times and with different effectiveness , depending on the detailed history of star and galaxy formation .",
    "this history is currently totally unexplored in conformal gravity , and the detailed mechanisms of the heating processes themselves are still poorly understood ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , the appropriate inclusion of these cooling and heating processes in our simulations is beyond the illustrative purpose of this paper .",
    "however , an appropriate interplay between cooling and heating processes could in principle provide a possible route to reconcile conformal gravity with the properties of x - ray clusters .",
    "in fact , since our results show that , for the typical gas density of real systems , the gas temperature is an order of magnitude larger than observed , radiative cooling would be very efficient in conformal clusters and the entire intracluster medium could cool in less than 1  gyr .",
    "effective heating processes would thus be necessary to reheat the intracluster medium to the observed x - ray temperatures .",
    "these heating processes must be more efficient in the cluster center than in the cluster outskirts , because the cooling time increases with the clustrocentric radius . however , although we can not exclude that the various complex physical processes could eventually conspire to reconcile conformal gravity with observations , it is plausible that , in order to provide intracluster media with the observed thermal properties , the cooling and heating processes should be severely fine - tuned during the formation and evolution of clusters and cluster galaxies .",
    "conformal gravity can explain the rotation curves of disk galaxies and the current accelerated expansion of the universe without resorting to dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we have modified a tree+sph code to run hydrodynamical simulations of isolated x - ray galaxy clusters to show that conformal gravity does not share the same success on the scales of clusters .",
    "these simulations confirm our simple analytic estimates that show that gas clouds with mass @xmath220  m@xmath167 , which are typical values of the total mass of the hot gas present in real clusters , remain confined with an equilibrium mean temperature @xmath221  kev , ten times larger than the observed temperatures ; more dramatically , because of the presence of a linear term in the gravitational potential , at large clustrocentric radius @xmath17 , the gas temperature increases with @xmath164 , rather than decreasing as in real systems .",
    "our analysis totally neglects radiative cooling and gas heating from astrophysical sources , as supernovae or active galactic nuclei .",
    "the interplay between these processes can in principle provide a way to reconcile conformal gravity with observations .",
    "it is however unclear if and how much these processes should be fine - tuned to provide x - ray clusters in agreement with observations .",
    "in addition to this topic , we can see two more open issues whose solution might also reconcile conformal gravity with observations :    1 .   in conformal gravity ,",
    "all the matter in the universe is expected to affect the local dynamics .",
    "the net effect is to contribute a constant inward acceleration @xmath222 in addition to the gravitational acceleration generated by local sources . because we included this constant acceleration in our simulations",
    ", we could neglect the rest of the universe and impose vacuum boundary conditions .",
    "it might be possible that assimilating the gravitational influence of the nearby matter surrounding the x - ray cluster in the constant `` universe '' acceleration @xmath222 is inappropriate : in fact , nearby external matter might decrease the gravitational attraction of the interior matter and hopefully reduce the thermal energy of the gas . to appropriately investigate this effect , we should simulate the dynamics of large - scale structure within a full cosmological context . however , this task is not trivial just because the gravitational field is highly non - local .",
    "this investigation would also benefit from the implementation into the numerical simulation of the yet unavailable theory of structure formation .",
    "2 .   the gravitationl potential we implemented in our simulations derives from a metric where the conformal invariance is broken by an arbitrary choice of the conformal factor @xmath10 .",
    "it is unclear whether this choice provides a coordinate system whose physics describes the real world or it is an artifact of the reference frame . it also remains to be seen whether a spontaneous breaking of the conformal invariance , in theories where matter and gravity are conformally coupled @xcite , can provide a metric , and thus a gravitational potential , where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster medium can be reproduced .    in section [ sec : intro ]",
    "we mentioned that the nucleosynthesis of light elements and the phenomenology of gravitational lensing are two open issues that need to be solved before accepting conformal gravity as a viable alternative theory of gravity and cosmology . here , we have shown that the thermodynamics of x - ray clusters poses a third challenge to this theory .",
    "we thank volker springel for making public his superb tree+sph code and the referee whose careful report prompted us to clarify some aspects of our results .",
    "we acknowledge vivid discussions with jrg colberg , keith horne and philip mannheim on very early versions of this work .",
