    "recently a new computational method is proposed to improve the scaling behavior of strong coupling expansion on the lattice @xcite . by the use of the method , scaling behavior of the @xmath3 vector model at two dimension",
    "was reinvestigated by studying the relation between @xmath4 @xmath5 bare coupling constant ) and the square of the dimensionless mass @xmath1 defined in the lattice momentum space .",
    "the new method starts with the series expansion generally available such as strong coupling expansion or hopping parameter expansion .",
    "specifically , @xmath2 is expanded in @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and the function is dilated around @xmath8 by the change of variable , @xmath9 @xmath10 . to access the continuum limit , the dilated @xmath2 at large @xmath1 , @xmath11 ,",
    "was expanded also in the dilation parameter @xmath0 and the value of @xmath0 is tuned to unity . since the series of @xmath2 is always truncated and expanded in @xmath0 , there appears no divergence even @xmath0 is set to unity .",
    "then , in a wide region of new @xmath1 , logarithmic scaling in accordance with the asymptotic freedom was found in truncated @xmath6 series of dilated @xmath2 in the large @xmath3 limit . at @xmath12 , rough scaling behavior of ising model",
    "was also found .",
    "the proposed method has some similarities with the so called delta expansion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the similarities become clear when the method proposed in @xcite is applied to the continuum models with explicit mass term .",
    "though the point of view from the dilation is not mentioned in the existing literatures , we thus use the term `` delta expansion '' to refer the method .",
    "however we like to point out following differences between the two methods : in the conventional delta expansion , the action @xmath13 of interest is generalized by introducing a parameter @xmath0 to @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents some solvable one . here",
    "@xmath0 is introduced as an interpolation parameter of @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "physical quantities are then expanded in @xmath0 and non - trivial results emerge after the substitution @xmath16 . however , in @xcite , @xmath0 is introduced as the parameter to dilate the scaling region of the system described by @xmath13 itself . although the conventional delta expansion requires good choice of @xmath15 and critical use of the principle of minimum sensitivity @xcite , in the new delta expansion , @xmath15 is obsolete and the later plays less important role .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply the new version of delta expansion to the anharmonic oscillator at strong coupling .",
    "a detailed study is presented on the subject of calculating the mass gap in the continuum limit , the gap energy between the ground state and the first excited state , via the series expansion effective at large lattice spacings . at strong coupling , the mass gap",
    "is generated non - perturbatively since it depends on the quartic coupling constant @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "thus the present investigation serves us a good testing ground of the new method .",
    "to focus on essential aspects , we confine ourselves with the pure anharmonic case where the harmonic mass term is absent from the action .",
    "the action @xmath13 on the lattice with lattice spacing @xmath19 is given by @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes a lattice site and the real field @xmath23 on the site @xmath21 is written as @xmath24 .",
    "the action can be simplified by rescaling field variables .",
    "let the rescaled field @xmath25 be defined by @xmath26 then , the action takes the following form , @xmath27 where @xcite @xmath28 note that the parameter @xmath2 is small when @xmath19 or @xmath17 is large .    for the purpose of the present work ,",
    "we need expansion of correlation length , or mass in momentum space in powers of @xmath2 and we use a technique of hopping expansion @xcite . as the first step we divide the action into the `` potential '' @xmath29 and the hopping term @xmath30 as @xmath31 an average of @xmath32",
    "is then calculated as follows : @xmath33 \\prod_{n}\\exp\\big[\\beta\\varphi_{n+1}\\varphi_{n}\\big]\\,\\omega \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{z}\\int\\prod_{i } \\left[d\\varphi_{i }   e^{-v(\\varphi_{i})}\\right ] \\times\\bigg(1+\\sum_{n}\\beta\\varphi_{n+1}\\varphi_{n}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{m , n(m\\neq n)}\\beta^2(\\varphi_{m+1}\\varphi_{m})(\\varphi_{n+1}\\varphi_{n})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{n}\\frac{\\beta^2}{2!}(\\varphi_{n+n}\\varphi_{n})^2+\\cdots\\bigg)\\omega.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 denotes the partition function given by @xmath35,\\ ] ] and @xmath34 may be expanded in powers of the hopping term .",
    "computation of expectation values includes the partition function as the divisor and we first compute @xmath34 to @xmath37th order of @xmath2 .",
    "the hopping expansion of @xmath34 to the first few orders reads @xmath38 \\times\\bigg(1+\\sum_{n}\\beta\\varphi_{n+1}\\varphi_{n}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{m , n(m\\neq n)}\\beta^2(\\varphi_{m+1}\\varphi_{m})(\\varphi_{n+1}\\varphi_{n})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{n}\\frac{\\beta^2}{2!}(\\varphi_{n+n}\\varphi_{n})^2+\\cdots\\bigg).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in figures 1 and 2 , it is convenient to use a graphical representation of each contributions .",
    "order in the hopping term . ]    to @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 to complete the expansion , we must expand @xmath41 in @xmath2 .",

    "to compute the mass gap in the continuum limit , we must address to the relation between @xmath2 and a variable relevant to the mass .",
    "one of quantities of our concern is therefore the inverse of the correlation length @xmath45 and it is extracted from the two point correlation function , @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "we calculate the correlation function by the use of the hopping expansion and , collecting the result to @xmath48 in @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath49 where the coefficient @xmath50 is given in appendix b. by the exponentiation , we find that all terms involving @xmath21 in the logarithm of @xmath46 are linear in @xmath21 .",
    "thus the exponential decay at large @xmath21 , @xmath51 , is explicitly confirmed .",
    "then we can write @xmath52 $ ] at large @xmath21 and @xmath53 . by expanding @xmath54 in @xmath2 and @xmath41 , we have the inverse of correlation length , @xmath55 one can obtain full expansion of @xmath56 by expanding @xmath41 in @xmath2 and the result reads @xmath57    on the lattice , the inverse of the correlation length and the mass in the momentum space are rather different objects",

    "their mutual relation is quite different from ( [ mxi ] ) .",
    "this might cause a non - negligible difference in the results obtained by the delta expansion as in the case of the large @xmath3 anharmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the actual results in the present case shall be discussed in the next section .    to make ready for the next section , we express @xmath6 as a power series of @xmath2 and then invert the series . from ( [ xibetascale ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) , we find @xmath63 inverting the above expansion , we arrive at @xmath64",
    "in this section , we first study the scaling behavior of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "then , we try to evaluate the mass gap in the continuum limit via dilated @xmath6 series of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we discuss the same subject by choosing various combinations of variables relevant to the mass gap computation .",
    "assume the scaling form @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the correction which vanishes in the @xmath67 limit .",
    "the constant @xmath68 is dimensionless and directly connected to the value of the mass gap as we can see below : from the definition of @xmath2 , we obtain for small enough @xmath1 @xmath69 the right hand side is independent of @xmath19 and the quartic coupling converges to its continuum value @xmath70 in the @xmath71 limit . now",
    ", let the dynamical mass @xmath72 in the continuum limit be defined conventionally by @xmath73 then , since @xmath74 in the @xmath71 limit , @xmath75 thus , @xmath19 should disappear and then @xmath76 and @xmath77 the result ( [ alpha ] ) is derived by assuming the generation of the finite dynamical mass .",
    "we will show by applying delta expansion that the assumption is actually confirmed in the large @xmath1 expansion of @xmath2 .",
    "then , we turn to the evaluation of @xmath68 which can not be guessed by such a dimensional argument .      to begin with let us see the behavior of @xmath6 series of @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the plot of ( [ largem ] ) at @xmath78nd and @xmath79th orders .",
    "it is clear that the series breaks down around @xmath80 or so and this implies the limitation of @xmath6 series .",

    "we dilate the scaling region of @xmath1 by introducing @xmath0 via @xmath9 in the function @xmath81 . in the large @xmath1 expansion ( [ largem ] ) , this means simply the change @xmath82 in respective terms .",
    "as @xmath0 approaches to unity , @xmath83 diverges to infinity , suggesting the violation of the large @xmath1 series .",
    "this is the point where the expansion in @xmath0 comes into play .",

    "the leading term in ( [ scaling2 ] ) should be expanded as @xmath98 and truncated at @xmath97 .",
    "then we find by setting @xmath16 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 thus , the asymptotic behavior is also dilated and the expansion in @xmath0 gives @xmath101\\sim a m^{-\\alpha}\\times z_{k}(\\alpha).\\ ] ] it would be clear from figure 4 that the power like behavior of the correct exponent ( [ alpha ] ) is seen at some finite region of @xmath1 .",

    "note that the region where the scaling is exhibited is not restricted to the neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of dilated functions .",
    "the reason that the position of the dotted line shifts upwards as the order increases is that the factor @xmath105 is produced by the delta expansion .",
