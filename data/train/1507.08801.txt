    "understanding the formation process of circumstellar dust is a fundamental step in exploring the origin of interstellar dust . from an observational point of view , however , we have limited knowledge about how dust condenses in gaseous stellar ejecta containing nucleo - synthesized heavy elements and how the dusty circumstellar environment is consequently formed .",
    "classical novae provide unique opportunities to observe those processes in a realistic timescale thanks to their relatively frequent occurrence in the nearby universe ( @xmath6 a few kpc from the sun ) .",
    "the composition of dust formed in the stellar ejecta depends on the chemical properties of the stellar atmosphere ; carbonaceous dust is formed when the c / o ratio in the envelope exceeds unity ( carbon - rich ) , while silicate dust is formed when the c / o ratio is less than unity ( oxygen - rich ) @xcite .",
    "recent infrared observations of some dusty novae , however , have detected the presence of emission from both carbonaceous and silicate dust : e.g. , nova v842 cen @xcite ; nova qv vul @xcite , nova v705 cas @xcite .",
    "the origin of such bimodal dust species , so far , has not been fully understood .",
    "infrared monitoring observations of nearby dusty novae over several years from their outbursts are crucial in investigating the temporal evolution of the dust properties at different epochs and in uncovering the dust formation history in the circumstellar and interstellar environments around the novae .",

    "the onset of dust formation around v1280 sco was reported on 23 days after the discovery @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with a classification of v1280 sco as a co nova @xcite .",
    "the dust formation peak was reported between 36 and 45 days in the nova wind ejected predominantly on day 10.5 @xcite with a wind speed of 500 km s@xmath7 @xcite . an expanding dust shell moving at 0.35@xmath80.03 mas day@xmath7",
    "has been reported based on vlti / amber and midi observations performed between days 23 and 145 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the major mass loss peak on day 10.5 , the rebrightening of v1280 sco was observed on day 110 , which may correspond to the secondary minor mass loss peak @xcite .",
    "the light curve evolution of v1280 sco is extremely slow and , therefore , the mass of the white dwarf is estimated to be @xmath9 or smaller @xcite .",
    "the distance to v1280 sco is still under debate .",
    "a distance @xmath10 of 1.6 kpc is estimated by @xcite , @xmath11 kpc by @xcite and 0.63 kpc by @xcite .",

    "in addition , no infrared echoes from the pre - existing silicate dust were detected in our mid - infrared spectrum taken on day @xmath199 .",
    "it is therefore more likely that the silicate emission observed on days 1272 , 1616 and 1947 is produced either by newly formed dust grains in the expanding nova ejecta or as a result of interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium , rather than by pre - existing circumstellar dust grains .",

    "<S> the temporal evolution of the infrared spectral energy distributions at 1272 , 1616 and 1947 days can be explained by the emissions produced by amorphous carbon dust of mass ( 6.68.7)@xmath110@xmath2m@xmath3 with a representative grain size of 0.01@xmath4 m and astronomical silicate dust of mass ( 3.44.3)@xmath110@xmath5m@xmath3 with a representative grain size of 0.30.5@xmath4 m . </S>",
    "<S> both of these dust species travel farther away from the white dwarf without an apparent mass evolution throughout those later epochs . </S>",
    "<S> the dust formation scenario around v1280 sco suggested from our analyses is that the amorphous carbon dust is formed in the nova ejecta followed by the formation of silicate dust either in the expanding nova ejecta or as a result of the interaction between the nova wind and the circumstellar medium . </S>"
