    "the combination of cosmic magnetic fields and charged particles , both of which are ubiquitous in the universe , results in the emission of synchrotron radiation from radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this radiation is fundamentally linearly polarized , and both the fractional polarization and electric vector polarization angle ( evpa ) of this emission show significant frequency - dependence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this frequency - dependence is due to faraday rotation and depolarization which , for extragalactic sources , are typically considered to be caused by magnetoionic material that either intervenes between us and the observed emitting region , or is intermixed with the emitting region itself .",
    "understanding of faraday rotation and astrophysical depolarization requires broadband radio measurements , and a large number of facilities are currently available or planned that will have the necessary bandwidth to study cosmic magnetic fields . for example , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) will observe at frequencies between 700  mhz and 1.8  ghz , @xcite , the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at @xmath1  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the low - frequency array ( lofar ) at @xmath2230  mhz , and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) between 80 and 300  mhz @xcite .    many of these facilities are pathfinders towards the square kilometre array ( ska ) cosmic magnetism project @xcite",
    ". the ska will detect up to @xmath4 polarized extragalactic sources on the sky at a mean spacing of @xmath5  arcsec @xcite , and provide broadband measurements of both the polarized fraction and faraday rotation .",
    "the polarimetric measurements that result will be used to construct a densely - sampled ` rotation measure grid ' @xcite that allow for analysis and reconstruction of the galactic magnetic field , for investigation of the evolution of magnetic fields over cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and can reveal physical properties of the central engines in radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "making sense of such data will require two capabilities : fast cross - matching algorithms for identification of counterpart sources with known redshifts at complementary wavelengths , and more importantly ` @xmath6-corrections ' that will allow for the polarization properties to be determined in the emitting frame of a source .",
    "these @xmath6-corrections will be necessary for the polarized fractions , the rotation measures , and possibly also for faraday rotators that have a non - linear relationship between the evpa and @xmath7 . in order to @xmath6-correct the polarized fraction to the emitting frame",
    ", we will require well - defined polarized spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "such seds can also be used to investigate the predominant causes of depolarization , and to classify individual sources .    as continuous broadband polarization data for a large number of sources",
    "will not be available until the next generation of radio telescopes , we can instead attempt to construct seds from existing data , to enable @xmath6-corrections of polarized sources .",
    "polarized seds can be reconstructed using the considerable amount of archival polarimetric radio data , but require careful consideration of numerous systematics including resolution effects , beam depolarization , multiple source components , time - variability , rician bias , differing uncertainties , outliers , and the use of either an interferometer or a single dish for data collection .",

    "this conglomeration of data not only provides the evpas , polarized fractions , and redshifts needed to construct and then @xmath6-correct a polarized sed , but also accumulates a large number of complementary parameters that are relevant to efforts for understanding cosmic magnetism .    in this paper , we cross - correlate the aforementioned data using a k - dimensional tree ( as described by * ? ? ?",

    "efforts have previously been made to identify complementary sources at other wavelengths in total intensity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nvss has also been used to identify optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts for 4,003 linearly polarized radio sources , using various resources including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the varying sky coverage , observational frequencies , and other systematics have complicated the interpretation of these previous catalogs , as it is not particularly clear which source population is being studied .",
    "a sample selected at a single observational frequency , and with as uniform sky coverage as possible , is therefore beneficial in minimizing the selection effects that are intrinsically abundant when producing such a catalog .",
    "as shall be detailed in section  [ crossmatching ] , our catalog constitutes a polarized 1.4  ghz flux - limited sample , based on the nvss .",
    "cross - matching is the process of identifying counterpart sources that are coincident in position on the sky .",
    "this process is typically used for total intensity measurements , but we seek to expand the method for cases with a corresponding polarization measurement .",
    "we wish to use such a technique to group measurements at different observing frequencies that correspond to the same physical source .",
    "various techniques have been previously implemented to cross - match radio catalogs , and any such method must provide quantitative limits on the probability of false catalog associations .",
    "previously used techniques have included nearest - neighbor searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bayesian approaches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such techniques constitute a form of coincidence - assessment that can be used to determine the probability of finding false matches , i.e.  the false - detection rate ( fdr ) .",
    "a cross - matching algorithm needs to be computationally efficient .",
    "we are limited here by our largest data set , the nvss , which consists of 1.8  million sources across 75% of the sky .",
    "we therefore implement the use of a k - dimensional tree @xcite .",
    "such an algorithm is a computationally inexpensive nearest - neighbor search  reducing the problem from @xmath8 to @xmath9  and returns all of the matches within a pre - defined spatial radius around a reference source .",
    "the k - dimensional tree is thereby able to rapidly eliminate large numbers of sources from a list of possible cross - matches .",
    "it is necessary to choose a _ reference catalog _ to which source associations can be concatenated .",
    "we define this reference catalog to be the nvss rm data at 1.4  ghz @xcite . each _ secondary catalog _",
    "was then cross - matched with the reference catalog .",
    "there are two possible outcomes to this process : ( i ) a cross - match exists and the relevant secondary catalog data are attached to the corresponding nvss rm source , or ( ii ) a cross - match does not exist and the secondary catalog data are discarded for that nvss rm source . in this manner , we produce a flux - limited sample that is selected on the basis of being polarized at 1.4  ghz .",
    "further constraints are also required in order to control the fdr , as the various secondary catalogs all have different resolutions , sensitivities , and unevenly - spaced coverage on the sky .",
    "the fdr is further affected by the combined astrometric errors of both the reference and secondary catalogs , which limit the accuracy of any given source position .",
    "the various sensitivities and sky coverage will only affect the completeness of our final catalog . on the other hand",
    ", the differing resolutions can introduce a number of systematics ( see section  [ systematics ] for further details on catalog systematics and limitations ) .",
    "however , we only consider sources that are unresolved at all wavelengths : ensuring that any measured beam depolarization is not affected by the differing parameter - space of each input catalog .",
    "the presence of beam depolarization , or otherwise , is one of the many physical inferences that may be drawn from a resulting catalog .",
    "furthermore , while the effects of multiple source components or internal source structure could likely only be overcome by a broadband and high - resolution all - sky polarization survey , such as that to be performed by askap or the ska  other measures of a source ( such as the total intensity spectral index and optical counterpart properties ) can also allow for such effects to be studied . in this way",
    ", differing resolutions do not affect a resulting catalog ; each source being consistently unresolved is rather an aspect that will be useful for future investigations .",
    "these effects are therefore beyond the scope of this current paper .",
    "importantly however , the differing resolutions could lead to potentially cross - matching independent sources that are unresolved in a given individual catalog  thereby increasing the fdr .",
    "we therefore need a matching criterion that defines a suitable astrometric matching radius , and that considers whether each source is appropriately isolated within the observing beam .",
    "we shall consider matching criteria in section  [ thematchingradii ] .    as the nvss rm data do not contain the angular size , evpa , or redshift of each source",
    ", we add this information to the catalog by cross - matching to the original nvss @xcite and to a catalog of nvss redshifts @xcite .",
    "as all three catalogs use the nvss source positions , an arbitrarily small cross - matching radius was used to combine the data .      as",
    "the fdr is a measure of the probability of coincidental associations , this must be primarily related to the density of sources on the sky .",
    "following @xcite , such a relation is given by @xmath59 where the probability of the nearest unrelated source , @xmath60 , lying within an area @xmath61 is dependent on the number of sources per square degree , @xmath62 . by adjusting the maximum threshold radius at which cross - matches are confirmed or rejected , it is therefore possible to control the fdr to be below some subjective limit that we deem to be acceptable .",
    "such methods are useful for checking if optical sources emit in the radio , as the coordinates to optical sources typically have good positional accuracy .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when comparing two sets of radio data , in which there may be significant inaccuracies in both surveys to be matched .",
    "furthermore , while such cross - matching evaluates the positional accuracy ( or astrometry ) of each measurement , it does not take resolution effects into account .",
    "it is possible that unresolved sources as seen with a larger observing beam are resolved into separate components in a high resolution survey .",
    "consequently , we define two radii for our matching criterion  an astrometric radius , @xmath63 , that accommodates the accuracy of a measured source position , and an isolation radius , @xmath64 , that handles resolution effects .    in choosing an astrometric radius , we need to properly consider that the astrometric errors are not dominated by those in a single survey , and that there are typically significant contributions from both the reference and secondary catalogs .",
    "we assume that the effects of s / n on the astrometry are negligible ; while the positional uncertainty typically depends on the s / n , all of our sources are of sufficient s / n to be detected in linear polarization  which tends to select the sources of highest total intensity flux density within a given survey .",
    "we approximate the rms uncertainty in the source positions to be given by the combined rms of both catalogs , such that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the contributions from the reference and secondary catalogs respectively .",
    "we estimate that a suitable @xmath63 could be @xmath68 , such that we would allow a match if a source is within the @xmath69% confidence interval .",
    "nevertheless , values of @xmath63 smaller than @xmath70 would also be acceptable , as this only serves to place a tighter constraint on the identified cross - matches .",
    "moreover , due to the low source density of our catalogs , coincidental matches can be expected to be low even for substantially larger @xmath63 ( see equation [ probfdr ] ) .",
    "of course , the most reliable method would be to independently measure the positional errors in each catalog . to balance these considerations , the exact chosen values of @xmath63 are determined empirically from an assessment of the fdr in section [ section : fdr ] .",
    "the estimated positional errors for each survey are stated in table [ tab : astrometry ] . in cases where the astrometry is not provided for a secondary catalog , we make the conservative estimate that the rms uncertainty in each position is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the fwhm of the resolution element .    in terms of an isolation radius , we always take @xmath64 to be equal to the fwhm of the catalog with the larger observing beam  regardless of whether the secondary catalog to be cross - matched has an observing beam that is smaller or larger than the nvss beam of fwhm @xmath73  arcsec . as",
    "@xmath64 is a radial distance , the source will always be isolated within @xmath74fwhm of the catalog with the larger observing beam .",
    "the isolation radius used is listed in table [ tab : astrometry ] .",
    "this provides a limited number of possible isolation scenarios while cross - matching an individual source , as follows :    no sources are detected within @xmath64 .",
    "only one source is detected within @xmath64 .",
    "more than one source is detected within @xmath64 .    in case ( i ) , nothing is done and we simply iterate to the next source . in case ( ii ) , the detected source is appended to the reference catalog if the astrometric radius does not denote this as a positional coincidence . in case ( iii ) , the source consists of multiple components and neither of these components are appended to the final catalog .",

    "these fdrs are best case scenarios , depending on our assumption that a rayleigh distribution can be used to model the polarized fractions . at the very minimum",
    ", we estimate that at least 578 of the 951 sources in our catalog are regular depolarizers , and can be considered to have a reduced fdr . for many more sources",
    "this becomes complicated to assess due to the uncertainty of each datum .",
    "it should be noted that such an argument does not exclude that we may be probing different parts of the source at each observing frequency , especially as the recorded @xmath26 in each input catalog is biased towards the most highly polarized region of a given source .",

    "we are therefore faced with the issue of both obtaining the parameters that define the fitted sed , while also attempting to determine the physical model that best describes each source . for this purpose of model selection ,",
    "we therefore need to pick a number of models a - priori that may describe the physics of each source .",
    "the functional forms of the chosen models are described in detail in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] , alongside our justification for their use .",
    "the physics that motivates each of these models is explained in appendix  [ appendix - b ] . distinguishing which of these is the _ correct _ model has been well - described in the case of univariate data @xcite , while in the case of bivariate data such as that presented here , linear regression is the most appropriate tool ( as described by e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we argue that we will still be dominated by random , rather than systematic errors .    for the large data volumes expected with the next generation of telescopes",
    ", automated and robust classification algorithms will be essential .",
    "such automated classification is complicated not just by an assessment of the quality of fit , but also by different physical models having varying numbers of degrees of freedom . in order to perform model selection in an automated fashion",

    "it is possible that the ` true ' sed has deviations from the model that our algorithm selects , and broadband polarization observations will be necessary to understand such rapid fluctuations as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "deviations from our assumed models are beyond the scope of this paper , but can in principle be investigated using the statistical tests we used to assess the quality of an sed model fit .      beyond a method for model selection",
    ", we also require a measurement of the quality of the model selection process . in the catalog we provide both the reduced-@xmath104 and the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov statistic for assessment of the quality of the model that is selected by our classification algorithm .",
    "we also provide the associated @xmath105-value for each test .",
    "these statistical tests are important for revealing cases where no model describes the data well .",
    "note that reduced-@xmath104 is not appropriate for many seds , as @xmath104 statistics are derived in the limit of a sample size that tends towards infinity .",
    "however , as least squares methods are derived from likelihood theory  and assume normally distributed residuals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the kolmogorov  smirnov statistic ( ks - test ) can be used as an alternative method to assess the normality of the residuals between our data and selected model .    in our particular case",
    ", we require comparison of the residuals to a normal distribution of unknown mean and variance  the ks - test can be modified to deal with such a case ( as described by * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the ks - test assumes that the data and model are independent , while in this case the data have been used to derive the model .",
    "this does not affect the value of the ks - statistic , but causes all associated @xmath105-values to be in error .",
    "we therefore perform ` bootstrap resampling ' .",
    "we evaluate the ks - test @xcite for an sed , and then find the correct @xmath105-value by combining our data and model datasets , and randomly sampling from them ( with replacement ) to form two new samples of size @xmath106 ( where @xmath106 is the number of sed datapoints ) .",
    "we then compute the ks - test statistic for these new self - generated samples .",
    "this process was repeated 10,000 times .",
    "the calculated @xmath105-value is the proportion of test statistics that are as extreme , or more so , than our original ks - test statistic .",
    "we find that the values correspond well with a @xmath105-value derived simply using tables and formulae @xcite .",
    "we do not indicate @xmath105-values @xmath107 or @xmath108 ; such values in the catalog indicate a lower or upper limit respectively .",
    "unlike for @xmath104 , a high sample size is not fundamental to the derivation of the ks - test . nevertheless , the ks - test still has sensitivity to sample size , and in seds with few data the residuals will have to deviate substantially from normality in order for a low @xmath105-value to be output .",
    "the @xmath105-values indicate the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one obtained , if the null hypothesis is true ( that the residuals are normally distributed or that the data are described by the assumed model , for the ks and @xmath104 tests respectively ) .",
    "note that the @xmath105-value only specifies the probability with which one would reject the null - hypothesis , if it _",
    "were _ correct  it unfortunately provides no information on the probability that the null hypothesis _ is _ correct , i.e.  we have calculated @xmath109 and not @xmath110 . for this frequentist approach , in cases where the @xmath105-value is lower than some threshold ( for example , @xmath111 ) , we take this to indicate a low probability of the two samples being as different as they are ( or more so ) , if drawn from the same distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since each test has its limitations and so as to avoid overreliance on a single measure , we combine the output of all tests to produce a data quality flag . the flag value is evaluated based on a subjective combination of the @xmath104 of the sed model , the @xmath105-value of the @xmath104 , and the @xmath105-value of the ks - test",
    "the flag has a value of 1 , 2 , or 3 and is provided as an indicative measure only ; these correspond to ` accept ' , ` caution ' , and ` poor ' , respectively .",
    "the extensive number of depolarization models , as discussed at length in appendix  [ appendix - b ] , can be primarily summarised by the ` burn ' @xcite , ` tribble ' @xcite , ` rossetti  mantovani ' , ` repolarizer ' , and ` spectral depolarizer ' @xcite forms .",
    "however , fitting these physical models to our data would arguably be misguided , as many of them assume an optically - thin emitting region . furthermore ,",
    "all of these models make either the critical assumption that we detect the same emitting region at each frequency , or that the polarized fraction is a meaningful quantity with the measured peak in polarized intensity on the sky emanating from the same emission region as the total intensity peak .",
    "as there is no way to verify this , and due to the large frequency range used , it is possible that any attempt at source classification will be corrupted .",
    "for example , a source that _ truly _ depolarizes following @xcite may appear as a peaked spectral depolarizer as different emission regions are probed at different frequencies , and at high frequencies the sed may be altered as the result of the combined effects of faraday depolarization together with beam depolarization due to multiple components , and disordered magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore argue that there is no reason to believe that any attempt to derive @xmath112 ( the rm dispersion of the faraday screen within a single beam  see appendix  [ appendix - b ] ) would be , or ever is , a reasonable physical probe without high resolution observations .",
    "in addition , our main goal is to use the sed to derive the rest - frame source properties , allowing us some flexibility in our fitting procedures .",
    "note that we are merely seeking a smoothly interpolating fit that is functionally similar to a physical model .    for the purposes of fitting models to the data ,",
    "we therefore ignore the underlying physics involved , and choose three models that serve as mathematical edifices in order to fit to the data . for the quality and sampling of data typically found in our catalog ,",
    "we find that these three simple , generalized functional forms can produce seds that broadly mimic the wavelength - dependence of polarization of the various physical models described in appendix  [ appendix - b ] .",
    "for our fits , we consider three possibilities : a gaussian , a power law , and a gaussian with a constant term , as shown in equations [ gaussian ] , [ powerlaw ] , and [ gauss+const ] respectively . given the limited number of data in each sed , these models serve as empirical analogues to the physical models in which we are ultimately interested , and are given by @xmath113 \\ , , \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] @xmath114 and @xmath113 + c_{4 } \\ , , \\label{gauss+const}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is in units of centimetres , and the @xmath115 are coefficients for which we solve during the fitting process .",
    "the units of @xmath115 are given in table  [ tab : modelsunits ] .",
    "with appropriately chosen coefficients , the gaussian model of equation  [ gaussian ] shows almost indistinguishable wavelength - dependence of fractional polarization to a ` burn ' law ( see equation  [ burnbabyburn ] ; * ? ? ? * ) or to a spectral depolarizer ( see appendix  [ spectraldepolrepol ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the power law model of equation  [ powerlaw ] provides a fit for a ` tribble ' law ( see equation  [ tribbling2 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is flexible enough to fit a ` repolarizer ' . similarly to equation  [ gaussian ] , with appropriately chosen coefficients the model for a gaussian with a constant term of equation  [ gauss+const ] behaves similarly to the ` rossetti ",

    "these models are all discussed in detail in appendix  [ appendix - b ] .",

    "this is due to the fact that we use a dependence on @xmath7 , rather than on @xmath120 as per the physical models of appendix  [ appendix - b ] .",
    "as both functions look similar , distinguishing between such models would require data of exceptional quality .",
    "we also again emphasize that our goal is to obtain the rest - frame source properties using a smoothly interpolating predictive sed that covers a broad range of wavelengths , and that can be used for the purpose of a @xmath6-correction .",
    "in addition , we also highlight that that there is no reason to believe that any attempt to derive @xmath112 would be , or ever is , a reasonable physical probe without high resolution observations .",
    "should a user of the catalog wish to obtain a quantity other than a source classification or @xmath6-correction from the sed , they are able to refit the sed using the raw data available in the catalog .    in all cases , fitting was only performed on sources for which data were available at three or more wavelengths and when the minimum wavelength separation between the three measurements was greater than 5  cm . due to the differing number of degrees of freedom for the various models ,",
    "attempts to solve equations [ gaussian ] and [ powerlaw ] were made only when there were three or more data , and attempts to solve equation [ gauss+const ] were made only when there were five or more data .",
    "various constraints were placed on the fitting process to ensure that only values of @xmath115 corresponding to physical solutions could be obtained .",
    "this is particularly important when fitting equation  [ gaussian ] , which has three degrees of freedom and can be fit to three data .",
    "nevertheless , this is necessary in order to attempt to classify peaked sources , i.e.  spectral depolarizers .",

    "we undertake a ` brute force ' approach , and fit to the data for every possible combination of positive and negative wrapping per datum , with any number of wraps between zero and five being allowed .",
    "this is computationally expensive , particularly for sources with large numbers of measurements .",
    "for example , a source with @xmath103 data across the squared - wavelength coverage has @xmath140 wrap combinations , each of which ( with the exception of zero wrap , which has no sign ambiguity ) has a further @xmath141 sign combinations  providing a total number of @xmath142 fitting attempts for a single source .",
    "however , only a fraction of these possibilities are physical ; for a source that demonstrates a linear relationship between evpa and @xmath7 the sign of a wrap at higher frequency can not change towards low frequencies . furthermore ,",
    "if there is a wrap at high frequency then all lower frequency measurements must also be unwrapped by at least an equal integer amount .",
    "this property was exploited to reduce the number of brute force attempts ; for a source with seven data this lowers the number of trial fits from 35,831,808 to just 10,836 .",
    "such a technique is biased towards providing high rms , as with a sufficient number of wraps the goodness of fit can be improved to arbitrary levels . to counteract this ,",
    "we utilize a modified version of the bic discussed in section  [ sourcefitting ] , taking @xmath6 to be the square of the maximum number of wraps .",

    "we here seek to present a collection of systematic effects that may guide the interpretation of data within the catalog . in order to ensure that the catalog is providing an accurate measure of astrophysical effects",
    ", we discuss these systematics , limitations , and other possible issues that could affect the quality of the catalog and of which a user of the catalog needs to be aware .",
    "note that each source in the catalog is considered unresolved at all wavelengths , and is still unresolved at the 45  arcsec resolution of the nvss .",
    "the angular size of each source in the nvss is included in the catalog .",
    "many of the sources included via the cross - matching process are likely affected by beam depolarization .",
    "this occurs as all observations have an intrinsic angular resolution that is determined by the size of the resolving beam .",
    "consider an extended source that is not uniformly polarized : if the radio telescope has a resolution that is coarser ( i.e.  an observing beam size that is larger ) than the angular scale over which the source polarization is coherent , then a given synthesized beam contains regions with different evpas .",
    "the synthesized beam therefore averages out the polarization of the source , and the measured polarization will be less than the true source polarization ( see appendix  [ externaldispersion ] ) .",
    "this ` beam depolarization ' can not be corrected for , even using a polarized sed with data at multiple wavelengths , which can not separate the astrophysical and beam - induced contributions .",
    "the only way to obtain the true source polarization would be to observe with a telescope that has better angular resolution relative to the original observations .",
    "complications can arise due to the spectral index and the multiple components of a radio source .",
    "an unresolved source may contain many sub - structures , so that within the resolving beam is a flat - spectrum compact nucleus and two steep - spectrum lobes / jets .",
    "these components become fainter or brighter with observing frequency , such that it is not trivial to confirm that we are observing the same dominant source component at all frequencies .",
    "again , observations with increased angular resolution would be useful in separating out these various source contributions .",
    "furthermore , for future studies , rm synthesis can in principle distinguish different emitting regions via their separation in the faraday spectrum , even if the components are not angularly resolved .",
    "the polarized fraction can also help in separating these components , as @xmath26 is typically higher at frequencies where steep - spectrum jets / lobes dominate .",
    "similarly , measurements of total intensity spectra may also help in resolving this issue .",
    "not only is there an expected difference in the spectral index from different emitting regions , but sources that contain multiple components within an individual resolution element may also show spectral curvature  although a number of other mechanisms can also cause such curvature .",
    "the data in the catalog are obtained over many different epochs , with the time between observations spanning up to @xmath147  years .",
    "both flux- and angle- variability in the sample may be significant .",
    "nevertheless , it is feasible that time - variable sources will experience similar amounts of positive and negative perturbations in total intensity and/or polarized fraction , i.e.  increases and decreases will occur in equal measure .",
    "in addition , it is also feasible that the time - variations themselves will be simultaneously similar for both the total and polarized intensity components  leading to an unchanged polarized fraction , i.e.  an increase in total intensity is directly proportional to the increase in polarized intensity .",
    "together with the large number of compiled measurements , this will serve such that any time - variability will just appear as increased variance in the estimates of depolarization and spectral index . furthermore , the catalog has also been cross - matched with optical identifications for each source @xcite",
    ". it should be possible to distinguish between source types with differing variability , and a user of the catalog is able to study sources by classification e.g.  galaxies and blazars .",
    "for the purposes of statistical studies , any derived results are again only affected in terms of increased sample variance . to assist the user in distinguishing potentially time - variable sources",
    ", we provide a data quality flag that is calculated based on statistical tests during fitting of the sed ( see section  [ sourcefitting ] ) .",
    "consider a source that has no intrinsic polarization , so that @xmath148 . as the measurements will be derived from images of @xmath46 and @xmath47 that contain gaussian noise ,",
    "it is clear that a measurement of @xmath149 from an image will always yield @xmath150 .",
    "this over - estimation of polarized intensity due to @xmath149 being positive - definite is known as ` rician bias ' . for higher s / n ratios ,",
    "the amount of this bias becomes increasingly small .",
    "nevertheless , at lower s / n ratios an estimator of the bias is essential to retrieve the true polarized intensity .",
    "the effects of rician bias , and the bias estimator have often changed in their use over the period in which the measurements have been collected . in many cases ,",
    "the exact method used has not been stated in the literature .",
    "as all of our sources are detected at @xmath151 at 1.4  ghz @xcite , and these sources tend to increase in polarized fraction at higher frequency , we make the assumption that each source is of sufficient s / n that the rician statistics are approximately gaussian  under such circumstances the bias in measuring a positive - definite quantity can be considered to be negligible .",
    "additional systematics in our catalog may also result from the different ways in which source properties have been measured and parameterized , i.e.  the source - finding technique used .",
    "we assume that such effects behave as random errors on each datum , and have negligible effects on an sed .",
    "modern single - dish measurements are typically done in ` on - off ' or ` dual - beam ' mode , so that any smooth galactic background can in principle be subtracted .",
    "nevertheless , the processing and observational details have not been stated in the literature for the single dish measurements that are included in the catalog  some of which were taken @xmath147  years ago .",
    "these measurements may not have removed a contribution from surrounding diffuse background components .",
    "such a systematic would increasingly affect our measurements in proximity to the galactic plane .",
    "any subtle correlations in the data at low galactic latitudes should be treated with caution .",
    "many individual catalogs also ignore the total intensity contribution to the error in polarized fraction . following standard error propagation",
    ", the fractional uncertainties in the polarized and total intensity measurements should be summed in quadrature as given by @xmath152 where @xmath26 is the polarized fraction , @xmath149 is the polarized intensity ( equal to @xmath153 , assuming that rician bias is negligible ) , @xmath44 is the total intensity , and @xmath154 is the one sigma uncertainty in these quantities . for sources that are weak in total intensity , or equivalently have a large fractional error in @xmath155 , neglecting this total intensity contribution can significantly underestimate the error in the polarized fraction . for our catalog , this additional contribution has been recalculated when enough information has been available to do so .    in practice ,",
    "antenna feeds never have a perfect response to polarization .",
    "these imperfections can be modeled as leakage from stokes @xmath44 into polarization , and is known as ` instrumental polarization ' or ` polarization leakage ' .",
    "error contributions from this instrumental polarization are by convention also typically ignored when calculating the errors in the polarized fraction . however",
    ", if leakages are calculated accurately to within @xmath156% then we would expect an additional error in each measurement .",
    "such an error can be trivially handled as an additive component to the uncertainty in each datum .",
    "the seds that we fit to the data in section  [ sourcefitting ] are potentially affected by the stated precision of each datum , which we use for weighting our data .",
    "the effects of outliers in our data are also of interest .",
    "there are two types of outliers : ( i ) those that are inaccurate , and ( ii ) those that are both inaccurate and imprecise .",
    "case ( i ) relates to occasional false cross - matches , or poor measurements in the original surveys that occur due to calibration or source fitting issues .",
    "these cause systematic errors in our derived source parameters .",
    "our low fdr , combined with the large number of measurements that are believed to be accurate , ensures that we still get reasonable values .",
    "this was tested on a simulated distribution of evpa measurements as a function of @xmath7 , and we find that a single outlier affects the calculated rm by less than 10  rad  m@xmath144 for sources with five measurements .",
    "case ( ii ) is more simply dealt with , as it occurs due to large measurement errors that in all cases are appropriately weighted during our fitting procedure .",
    "the effects of outliers therefore tend to be reduced by the fitting and weighting procedure , but still have the property of increasing the variance in any estimated parameters .",
    "the catalog therefore works well for statistical measurements of polarized source properties  our fdr suggests that the number of inaccurate matches represents @xmath157% of the total sample .",
    "nevertheless , we recommend that appropriate caution is used if attempting to derive physical properties from the polarization sed of a single source .",
    "we have produced a new , broadband radio polarization catalog .",
    "our catalog uses the nvss rm catalog @xcite as a reference , with our ` full - catalog ' incorporating 37,543 radio sources , of which 25,649 have measurements of both the rotation measure ( rm ) and total intensity spectral index .",
    "the catalog is expected to consist of mostly classical radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "normal galaxies are only expected to constitute a significant fraction of the 1.4  ghz polarized source counts at @xmath1431  mjy in total intensity , and at 1 to @xmath158  jy in polarized intensity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  approximately two orders of magnitude below the nvss sensitivity limit . in this catalog ,",
    "we have provided power - law depolarization measurements for 1,171 radio sources with @xmath123 polarization measurements at independent frequencies , and a full , modeled sed in both polarized and total intensity for 951 radio sources with @xmath159 multiwavelength polarization data . these 951 sources with modeled seds are available as a secondary ` sed - catalog ' , constituting a subset of our primary data product .",
    "the catalog includes spectroscopic redshifts for 620 of these polarized seds .",
    "based on the model selection criteria and various statistical tests described in the main text , we consider 533 of these seds to be excellent  an improvement of an order of magnitude over any other published sample of polarized seds .",
    "the breakdown of seds in our catalog by different depolarization models suggests that 42.2% of sources are best described by a tribble - law , 20.6% by repolarization , 19.4% by spectral depolarization , 9.0% by a rossetti  mantovani law , and 8.8% by a burn - law .",
    "see section  [ sourcefitting ] and table  [ tab : models ] for further detail on how these models are derived .",
    "note that these add up to 100% , as we have not included a ` no best fit ' category . even if the data quality flag is taken into account , and ` poor ' fitting models are excluded from our analysis , the percentages are changed such that 42.5% of sources are best described by a tribble - law , 16.0% by repolarization , 21.9% by spectral depolarization , 11.0% by a rossetti  mantovani law , and 8.6% by a burn - law .",
    "note that the fraction of repolarizers is substantially affected  this is unsurprising given that we use a power law to fit the repolarizers , and that this is based on the flexibility of the power law , rather than an exact physical model of what could be expected from different emission regions .",
    "note that such depolarization models are only applicable if the same emitting region is probed at all frequencies  as we shall discuss in this section , a key physical inference from our catalog is that this is likely not the case .    a density plot showing the number of sources with given total intensity and polarized spectral indices is shown in fig .  [ i_versus_p_alphas ] .",
    "there is a clear divide in the depolarization of radio sources that occurs at @xmath160 , with steep - spectrum sources showing larger depolarization ( @xmath161 ) , and flat - spectrum sources tending to retain an essentially constant polarized fraction as a function of @xmath11 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we split the sample into two subsets of @xmath24 values , consisting of either flat - spectrum ( @xmath163 ) or steep - spectrum ( @xmath164 ) sources .",
    "sources with @xmath165 are not included in order to minimize cross - contamination between our samples , although our conclusions are not affected by changing this @xmath0-threshold . the two - sample kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test on @xmath24 provides a @xmath105-value of @xmath166 , which indicates a very low probability of the two samples being this different , or more so , if drawn from the same distribution .",
    "this is consistent with a population of both core- and jet - dominated sources , in which steep - spectrum sources measure the optically thin lobes and jets ejected by an agn , while flat - spectrum sources measure the optically thick region surrounding the central black hole of a radio galaxy .",
    "as the total intensity spectral index is an intrinsic source property , this implies that depolarization must mainly occur within the local source environment , rather than being due to intervening faraday screens .",
    "we argue that such an effect is unlikely to be due to confounding variables , with independent samples selected at 20  ghz ( i.e.  core - dominated sources ) also finding no statistically significant evidence of a relationship between the fraction of polarization and frequency @xcite .",
    "one may argue that this could be caused by beam depolarization , with the flat - spectrum central engine being more compact , and tending to have smaller rm dispersion than the steep - spectrum sources .",
    "in such a case , the compact sources would show _ some _ depolarization ; instead , the distribution of @xmath24 for flat - spectrum sources is approximately symmetric about a mean value of zero ( see the red histogram in fig .  [ i_versus_p_alphas ] ) .",
    "in fact , the distribution appears very slightly skewed with a few more sources showing @xmath167 rather than @xmath161 .",
    "for pure beam depolarization , @xmath24 must _ always _ be @xmath168 .",
    "consequently , while there are possible alternative interpretations of our results , any such hypotheses are restricted in that they must be able to explain this approximately symmetric distribution of the flat - spectrum sources around @xmath162 . as the most consistent explanation for the repolarizing ( @xmath167 ) sources",
    "is that this is a consequence of different emitting regions being probed at different frequencies , the symmetrical distribution appears to indicate that different emitting regions are also giving rise to the depolarizing ( @xmath161 ) sources .",
    "previous studies have suggested that intervening galaxies with a clumpy interstellar medium are important for explaining depolarization of background sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the likelihood of intersecting an intervenor increases for sources at high @xmath169 , one could hypothesise from fig .",
    "[ i_versus_p_alphas ] that steep - spectrum sources are more distant .",
    "however , such a scenario can not explain why the flat - spectrum sources have an approximately symmetrical distribution that is centred about @xmath162 .",
    "similarly , it also does not explain the presence of repolarizing sources . as a further point in favour of our interpretation , due to relativistic beaming",
    ", one expects the flat - spectrum ( core - dominated ) sources to be the more distant for a flux - limited selected sample such as the nvss .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence from the catalog that allows one to completely rule out the currently proposed models of ` partial coverage ' ( farnes et al . in preparation ) .",
    "our data also show that repolarization can occur in some sources , although importantly this is predominantly associated with flat - spectrum ( i.e.  presumably core - dominated ) sources .",
    "our classification algorithm finds that 203 sources ( 21% ) of our sample show repolarization .",
    "[ i_versus_p_alphas ] shows that the lobe - dominated sources are mostly located with @xmath170 , however @xmath147% of the population of core - dominated sources have @xmath167 . together with the flat - spectrum sources tending to retain a relatively constant polarized fraction as a function of @xmath11 , we interpret this as a consequence of the core s optical thickness , with synchrotron self - absorption leading to the observation of different emitting regions within the source .",
    "this results in the observation that a source is repolarizing ( and even depolarizing ) , when we are instead likely detecting regions of increasingly ordered magnetic field that are at greater distances from the central engine .",
    "optically thick emission , although rarely considered , can result in more complicated behavior in a polarized sed  including oscillations and even constant polarized fractions at increasing wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "our data therefore support the hypothesis that flat - spectrum radio polarization measurements probe polarization structure in the optically thick quasar core , with the sources tending to provide a constant polarized fraction over a large range in wavelength merely due to the sparse sampling in @xmath11-space which undersamples the oscillatory behaviour .",
    "as repolarization is also present for some lobe - dominated sources , it appears to indicate that a combination of spectral index and depolarization effects can always cause one to probe different polarized emitting regions at different frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , there are only a relatively small number of repolarizing steep - spectrum objects , unlike the symmetric flat - spectrum distribution about @xmath171 .",
    "the steep - spectrum sample _ can not _ therefore be similar to the flat - spectrum sample but with some additional depolarizing component .",
    "we argue that the most consistent physical description is of a divide based on the local source environment , with the large number of repolarizers showing that we do not sample similar emitting regions at different frequencies .    as a substantial number of sources in our sample",
    "are repolarizing , this indicates that the run of polarized fraction with observing wavelength is substantially affected by different emitting regions within a source . from an observational perspective",
    "this is problematic , as attempts to derive any particular depolarization law from a run of polarized fraction with @xmath11 must attempt to separate different emitting regions .",
    "this is normally not considered , as the depolarization is typically considered to be most strongly affected by screens of material along the line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , the results from our new and larger sample suggest that faraday depolarization in extragalactic sources is largely an ` internal ' effect that occurs within the local source environment .",
    "this has implications for the physical interpretation of polarized seds , and complicates the interpretation of broadband polarization observations for the purposes of measuring seds and rms .",
    "in such a scenario , a balance must be obtained between broadband measurements ( which provide a larger lever in @xmath7-space ) , and narrow - band observations ( which are more likely to probe the same source component across a frequency range of interest ) .",
    "this has implications for future broadband polarimetric surveys .",
    "high - resolution follow - up observations will be required to further understand the effects of different emitting regions on polarized seds .    for the steep - spectrum objects in our catalog ,",
    "there is weak evidence of a bimodal distribution in @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ i_versus_p_alphas ] ) , with two distinct peaks .",
    "if true , this would suggest two populations of depolarizer , possibly consistent with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stronger conclusions on the garrington  laing and liu  pooley effects will require extensive further study of these data . this will require a cleaner sample that is separated by source type ( e.g.  by using the optical identifications that are included in the catalog  see appendix  [ appendix - a ] ) , and through high - resolution follow - up observations to identify the morphology of both the source and the polarized emitting region . such studies , albeit with smaller sample size , have recently identified relations between rm , depolarization and the complexity of the faraday spectrum for polarized sources  concluding that the depolarization originated within the sources , for instance in their radio lobes , or in intervening galaxies on the line of sight . as a point of further interest ,",
    "plots of the distribution of parameters in our catalog for the various models selected by the bic are shown in fig .",
    "[ c_plot ] .",
    "this shows that the majority of sources have a maximum polarized fraction of @xmath93% , with some sources having polarized fractions up to @xmath172% .",
    "while the majority of sources show regular depolarization , those sources that are peaked tend to have a maxima in polarized fraction at a wavelength of @xmath158 to @xmath173  cm .",
    "sources that maintain a constant polarized fraction out to large wavelengths ( a rossetti  mantovani law , i.e.  that include a coefficient @xmath119 ) , tend to remain polarized at only the @xmath174 to @xmath175% level . the physical model that is selected as corresponding to the coefficient values can be determined using table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "we have presented a multiwavelength catalog of radio polarization that increases the number of well - defined polarized seds by over an order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting polarized seds have a frequency range of 0.4  ghz to 100  ghz , and our best sources are constrained by up to 56 independent polarization measurements .",
    "we have used a k - dimensional tree for the cross - matching , reducing the computational expense by a factor of @xmath176 , and have used an automated classification algorithm based on the bayesian information criterion to distinguish between different models for the faraday depolarization .",
    "the catalog also contains constraints on the total intensity spectral index and curvature , the broadband rm , spectroscopic redshift , angular size , and estimated non - thermal rest - frame luminosity at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the catalog will allow a number of parameters to be explored in the effort to understand cosmic magnetic fields . in this paper",
    ", we have found that our sample is consistent with two populations of core- and jet - dominated sources based on the clustering in the plane of the polarized fraction versus total intensity spectral indices .",
    "this is consistent with the optically - thin jet / lobe - dominated sources undergoing significantly more depolarization relative to the optically - thick core - dominated sources .",
    "such a connection implies that radio source depolarization predominantly occurs within the local source environment , rather than being due to intervening faraday screens .",
    "importantly , the catalog will be of particular use in @xmath6-correcting polarized seds into the source rest - frame .",
    "these @xmath6-corrections can be performed by using the statistical tests provided in the catalog to select good quality seds , and to use the depolarization model selected by the bic .",
    "the @xmath6-corrected polarized fraction , i.e.  in the source rest - frame , for equivalent emission to that at 1.4  ghz and @xmath177 is then the corresponding polarized fraction at @xmath178  cm .",
    "the @xmath6-corrected faraday depth can be obtained using a multiplicative factor of @xmath179 to correct for the effects of cosmological expansion , however this assumes that all of the faraday rotation is occurring at the source .",
    "such a correction will break down if there is any galactic or intervening contribution .",
    "the @xmath179 correction to the faraday depth also assumes a linear relationship between the evpa and @xmath7  if the relationship is non - linear and the faraday depth measured using a narrowband , then it will be necessary to @xmath6-correct the polarization angle sed in a similar way to @xmath6-correcting the polarized fraction , i.e.  by sliding the sed and then reestimating the faraday depth .",
    "this catalog is an enabling step for such @xmath6-corrected studies , as an increased sample of polarized seds will not be available until the advent of the ska and other next generation facilities such as askap  which will yield the necessary broadband polarization data in combination with a redshift .",
    "the results of the @xmath6-corrections themselves constitute an extensive additional study , as such studies of magnetic field evolution are hindered by the ability to classify different source types ( e.g.  normal versus active galaxies , by viewing angle , core- versus lobe- dominated ) , by luminosity effects / malmquist bias , and possibly by other evolutionary effects such as changes in the bulk lorentz factor of radio jets .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath6-correction of the rm into the rest - frame by a factor of @xmath179 assumes that the faraday rotating medium is all local to the source  reliable removal of galactic contributions , together with measures of the magnetoionic content along typical lines of sight , are essential to probe the evolution of cosmic magnetism .",
    "other parameters such as the total intensity spectral indices will assist in the process of source classification and correcting for luminosity effects , although higher resolution data are necessary to reveal how reliably this separates core- and lobe - dominated sources .",
    "in addition to @xmath6-corrections , there are also many subsidiary applications , including studies of where faraday rotation occurs along the line of sight , the spectral index versus redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , measurements of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and investigations of intervening mg  ii absorption systems and their effects on sed type and depolarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous similar catalogs have not focused on polarization measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this therefore is the most comprehensive catalog of polarization measurements available to date .",
    "our catalog is reliable , with more than 95% of polarization measurements being correctly associated , and more than 93% of total intensity measurements .",
    "the reliability is further improved by the source fitting procedures . nevertheless , while we have selected our catalog as a 1.4  ghz flux - limited polarized sample , selection effects are still likely considerable and are hard to constrain .",
    "the sky coverage of the accumulated data is patchy , and typically taken via shallow observations on the brightest known sources .",
    "as the brightest sources have typically been observed repeatedly , we obtain many more measurements for the brightest sources , and consequently the seds of the fainter sources are less well - constrained .    despite these inevitable effects",
    ", the listed polarized seds can reveal the physical form of depolarization , and allow for physical models of the intervening magnetic field structure to be ascertained .",
    "the predominant depolarizing mechanism is important for modelling polarized source counts at low radio frequencies , which will have a substantial impact on the number of polarized sources detectable by facilities such as lofar , mwa , and the ska @xcite .    alongside the multiple possible analyses of the catalog we have presented",
    ", additional future work will allow for expansion of these data .",
    "numerous other polarization measurements are available in the literature .",
    "furthermore , our catalog currently uses the nvss rm catalog of @xcite as the reference data ; if a source is not listed as polarized in the @xcite catalog at 1.4  ghz , then polarization measurements at other frequencies are not accumulated into our catalog .",
    "furthermore , polarization measurements in the southern sky ( at declinations @xmath180 ) are currently not included in our catalog .",
    "future work could therefore use a larger reference catalog .",
    "for example , the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) @xcite explores a similar parameter space to the nvss in the southern sky ( albeit without polarization information ) .",
    "a combination of the full total intensity nvss measurements @xcite , together with the total intensity measurements from sumss , would therefore greatly expand our reference catalog .",
    "using an nvss+sumss reference catalog for cross - matching with additional polarization measurements accumulated from across the literature , would lead to a much larger sample of polarized seds  including those sources that undergo the most extreme depolarization .",
    "more recent polarization surveys , such as the s - band polarization all sky survey ( s - pass ) at 2.3  ghz , will provide @xmath181 polarized sources in the southern sky @xcite  corresponding to a significant increase in sample size .",
    "in addition , possible upcoming polarization surveys will also be able to make substantial contributions to such an effort  detecting up to 2.2@xmath18210@xmath183 sources in polarized intensity at 2 to 4  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . such cross - matched catalogs ,",
    "particularly when combined with large samples of redshifts , will continue to constitute useful resources for probing magnetic fields and other astrophysical phenomena .",
    "we thank paul hancock for useful discussions on cross - matching , phil kronberg for helpful advice on fitting broadband rotation measures , shane osullivan for insightful conversations on radio source depolarization , and xiaohui sun for helpful comments on other existing polarization measurements .",

    "the polarization properties of sources at radio wavelengths are dominated by various forms of astrophysical depolarization that can be described by a number of models . for the purpose of model selection ,",
    "we need to pick a number of models a - priori that may describe the physics of each source . this depolarization can be a reduction in the polarized fraction that occurs either internally to the radio source or in its foreground i.e.  externally  somewhere along the line of sight between us and the source environment .",
    "when the depolarization occurs externally , we consider this to be the result of a _ foreground depolarizing screen_. the effects of external screens must be removed if we are to understand the internal structure of radio sources , where thermal plasma is mixed with the magnetoionic medium responsible for the radio emission .",
    "this separation of internal and foreground effects is complicated as both have a similar wavelength dependence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the relationship between polarized fraction , @xmath26 , and wavelength , @xmath11 , can be an insensitive test of the rm structure , unless information in stokes @xmath46/@xmath47 is considered simultaneously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , statistical measures of sed properties can still be used to ascertain the predominant form of depolarization .",
    "we now explain the various forms of depolarization in detail .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we focus on depolarization in optically thin emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "optically thick emission could result in more complicated behavior in a polarized sed  including oscillations and even constant polarized fractions at increasing wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".      in the case of optically thin synchrotron radiation , random fluctuations from a disordered magnetic field within a source can lead to a reduced fractional polarization given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the uniform and random field strengths respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the total intensity spectral index , @xmath0 , is defined such that @xmath21 .",
    "extensions to equation  [ internal ] have been proposed .",
    "as the sources in our catalog are always unresolved , this effect is independent of wavelength  we consider it no further in this paper .",
    "internal faraday depolarization ( also called ` depth- ' or ` front  back- ' depolarization ) takes places when the emitting and faraday rotating regions within a source are intermixed .",
    "this internal depolarization can be separated into two types : ( i ) differential faraday rotation , and ( ii ) internal faraday dispersion . for ( i ) , in the presence of a regular magnetic field , the plane of polarization of emission from the far side of the region undergoes a different amount of faraday rotation compared to emission from the near side .",
    "the process is known as ` differential faraday rotation ' and the sum through the entire region ( along the line of sight ) results in depolarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this process leads to depolarization , it is characterized by ` bobbing ' of the polarized fraction as a function of increasing wavelength .",
    "this bobbing is difficult to identify in seds with sparse frequency sampling , and could likely only be measured using a wide and continuous observing bandwidth . for (",
    "ii ) , in the presence of a turbulent magnetic field , the plane of polarization experiences random fluctuations as it propagates through the region .",
    "this process is known as ` internal faraday dispersion ' and this addition of random anisotropic magnetic fields results in further depolarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , observational evidence suggests that internal faraday effects are likely not the dominant cause of depolarization in extragalactic radio sources  we therefore consider it no further in this paper .",
    "external faraday depolarization occurs if the faraday rotation in front of the emitting region varies significantly across the source over a solid angle smaller than the beam ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a faraday screen consists of a magnetoionic region that is devoid of relativistic particles and that exists somewhere along the line of sight between the observer and the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this faraday screen contains a constant regular field then the region causes faraday rotation of the polarized emission from background sources , but does not cause any depolarization .",
    "nevertheless , any deviation from a constant field within the synthesized beam will create a rm gradient and subsequently cause depolarization .",
    "such anisotropy of the @xmath187 field is caused by either turbulent , or systematically varying regular fields .",
    "for turbulent magnetic fields or _",
    "external faraday dispersion _ , depolarization occurs when there are many turbulent regions within the synthesized beam . for regular magnetic fields or _",
    "beam depolarization _",
    ", depolarization will occur if there are any variations in the strength or orientation of the field within the synthesized beam ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two situations are analogous and for the case of turbulent fields with the values of rm having a large spread over the beam , and for the case of a systematically varying regular field with a gradient in the external rm across the beam , the polarization is rotated through different angles in each direction at longer @xmath11 , resulting in a reduction in @xmath26 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for further detail ) .",
    "the effect of external faraday depolarization was initially described by @xcite with an equation of the form @xmath188 where @xmath112 is the rm dispersion of the faraday screen within a single beam .",
    "a smoothly interpolating simple approximation to a burn law can be provided using a gaussian model , see e.g.  equation  [ gaussian ] in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] .",
    "nevertheless , observations show that significant polarized emission continues to be detectable at relatively large wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showing that the relationship between polarized fraction and wavelength can not be as strong as a function of @xmath120 for all sources . evidence for deviations from a burn law have also been found from diffuse polarized emission .",
    "the equations of @xcite were extended by @xcite to show that at long wavelengths ( @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the wavelength at which the polarized fraction is half its maximum value ) the polarized fraction can decrease via a power law such that @xmath191 \\lambda^{-2 } \\",
    ", , \\label{tribbling}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 is a measure of the resolution , with @xmath193 being related to the beam fwhm@xmath194 and @xmath195 being the size of the rm fluctuations .",
    "importantly , @xcite shows that depending on the precise form of the structure function of the rm fluctuations , the polarization can actually fall off such that @xmath196 ( and not only as @xmath197 ) , where @xmath198 has been shown observationally to approximately vary between @xmath174 and @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the tribble models are all calculated in the source rest - frame , such that the regime @xmath189 is not well - defined without extensive prior measurements of a radio source .",
    "a more general solution is therefore given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is some constant and @xmath24 is a polarization spectral index .",
    "note that @xmath24 is defined in the opposite sense to the total intensity spectral index , @xmath0 , in that it is the exponent of observing frequency rather than wavelength .",
    "such power laws have previously been used to define polarization spectral energy distributions .",
    "a smoothly interpolating fit for a tribble law can be provided using a power law model , see e.g.  equation  [ powerlaw ] in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] .",
    "more recently , it has also been shown that the polarization can decrease as a function of @xmath120 at smaller wavelengths  as proposed by @xcite  but then remains unexpectedly constant out to longer wavelengths .",
    "there have been attempts to explain these seds as a result of ` partial coverage ' , with the explanation that only a fraction of the source is covered by an inhomogeneous faraday screen . in an effort to derive @xmath112 for these sources , make an empirical modification to equation [ burnbabyburn ] so that @xmath202 \\ , , \\label{partialcoverage}\\ ] ] where @xmath203 is interpreted as the covered ( depolarizing ) fraction of the source , with the uncovered fraction @xmath204 retaining a constant @xmath26 out to arbitrarily long wavelengths .",
    "this model was found to be more successful in reproducing the form of some polarized seds . a smoothly interpolating simple approximation for a rossetti ",
    "mantovani law can be provided using a gaussian with a constant term , see e.g.  equation  [ gauss+const ] in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] .    as a point of further interest",
    ", @xcite also considered a partial coverage model . under the assumption that depolarization could be originating from discrete clouds in the galaxy",
    ", there would be @xmath106 average clouds along the line of sight .",
    "following , if @xmath205 the depolarization is similar to equation [ burnbabyburn ] , while several lines of sight will not intersect any cloud if @xmath206 .",

    "such clouds may reasonably exist in the environment surrounding a radio source .",
    "such a functional form also follows a similar decline to that of equation [ partialcoverage ] , and high - quality data would be needed to distinguish between these similar models .",
    "differences in the total intensity spectral index of components in an unresolved source can result in different regions of a source being probed at different observing frequencies .",
    "the effect of a typical radio galaxy which has a flat - spectrum , weakly polarized core combined with steep - spectrum , more - highly polarized lobes / jets , can be observed in a significant number of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this ` spectral depolarization ' tends to give rise to a prominent peaked structure in a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath11 . in some cases",
    ", this may also give rise to behavior analogous to beating between two oscillatory components @xcite .",
    "a smoothly interpolating simple approximation for a spectral depolarizer can be provided using a gaussian model , see e.g.  equation  [ gaussian ] in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] .",
    "some sources also exhibit ` inverse depolarization ' or ` repolarization ' , with the polarized fraction increasing at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is again likely the consequence of a multiple unresolved components within a compact source , and the probing of different emitting regions at different frequencies .",
    "such repolarization can also be explained as increased ordering of the magnetic field in the component of the source nearest to the observer along the line of sight . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the emitting region further into the source depolarizes  effectively constituting a measurement of different source components at different observational frequencies .",
    "increasing @xmath26 could also arise in the unresolved , optically - thick core region where one is observing different parts of the jet at different wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a smoothly interpolating simple approximation for a repolarizer can be provided using a power law model , see e.g.  equation  [ powerlaw ] in section  [ fittingpolarizedsed ] .",
    "other explanations have also been proposed , and repolarization could occur in jets that are well separated from the core in the optically thin part of the jet , and are also reasonably isolated from other strong jet features @xcite .",
    "other suggested physical models propose that internal faraday rotation acts to align the polarization from the far and near sides of a jet , leading to increased @xmath26 at longer wavelengths .",
    "helical and randomly tangled magnetic fields have also been suggested as being responsible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
