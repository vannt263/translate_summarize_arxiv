    "generation of turbulence - like fields ( also known as _ synthetic turbulence _ ) has received considerable attention in recent years .",
    "several schemes have been proposed @xcite with different degrees of success in reproducing various characteristics of turbulence .",
    "recently , scotti and meneveau @xcite further broadened the scope of synthetic turbulence research by demonstrating its potential in computational modeling . their innovative turbulence emulation scheme based on the _ fractal interpolation technique _ ( fit ) @xcite was found to be particularly amenable for a specific type of turbulence modeling , known as large - eddy simulation ( les , at present the most efficient technique available for high reynolds number flow simulations , in which the larger scales of motion are resolved explicitly and the smaller ones are modeled ) . the underlying idea was to explicitly reconstruct the subgrid ( unresolved ) scales from given resolved scale values ( assuming computation grid - size falls in the _ inertial range _ of turbulence ) using fit and subsequently estimate the relevant subgrid - scale ( sgs ) tensors necessary for les .",
    "simplicity , straightforward extensibility for multi - dimensional cases , and low computational complexity ( appropriate use of _ fractal calculus _ can even eliminate the computationally expensive explicit reconstruction step , see section [ sec4 ] for details ) makes this fit - based approach an attractive candidate for sgs modeling in les .",
    "although the approach of @xcite is better suited for les than any other similar scheme ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it falls short in preserving the essential small - scale properties of turbulence , such as multiaffinity ( will be defined shortly ) and non - gaussian characteristics of the probability density function ( pdf ) of velocity increments .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extend the approach of @xcite in terms of realistic turbulence - like signal generation with all the aforementioned desirable characteristics and demonstrate its potential for les through a - priori analysis ( an les - sgs model evaluation framework )",
    ". we will also demonstrate the competence of our scheme in the emulation of passive - scalar fields for which the non - gaussian pdf and multiaffinity are significantly pronounced and can not be ignored .",
    "the fractal interpolation technique is an iterative affine mapping procedure to construct a synthetic deterministic small - scale field ( in general fractal provided certain conditions are met , see below ) given a few large - scale interpolating points ( anchor points ) .",
    "for an excellent treatise on this subject , the reader is referred to the book by barnsley @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will limit our discussion ( without loss of generality ) only to the case of three interpolating data points : @xmath0 . for this case , the fractal interpolation iterative function system ( ifs ) is of the form @xmath1 , where , @xmath2 have the following affine transformation structure : @xmath3\\left ( { { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }   x \\hfill \\\\   u \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array } } } \\right ) + \\left ( { { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }   { e_n } \\hfill",
    "\\\\   { f_n } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array } } } \\right),\\mbox { } n = 1,2.\\ ] ] to ensure continuity , the transformations are constrained by the given data points as follows : @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 the parameters @xmath7 can be easily determined in terms of @xmath8 ( known as the vertical stretching factors ) and the given anchor points @xmath9 by solving a linear system of equations .",
    "the attractor of the above ifs , @xmath10 , is the graph of a continuous function @xmath11 \\to { \\rm r}$ ] , which interpolates the data points @xmath9 , provided the vertical stretching factors @xmath8 obey @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 } \\right\\ } , \\\\",
    "\\mbox{where , } \\\\    u\\left ( { x_i } \\right ) = \\tilde { u}_i , \\mbox { } i = 0,1,2 . \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] moreover , if @xmath14 and @xmath9 are not collinear , then the fractal ( box - counting ) dimension of @xmath10 is the unique real solution @xmath15 of @xmath16 ( for rigorous proof see @xcite ) . in the special case of three equally spaced points covering the unit interval [ 0,1 ] ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath17 , the parameters of the affine transformation kernel become : @xmath18 in this case , the solution for the fractal dimension @xmath19 becomes : @xmath20 notice that the scalings @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free parameters and can not be determined using only equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ; at least one more constraint is necessary .",
    "for example , @xcite chose to use the additional condition : @xmath23 .",
    "not long ago , it was found that turbulent velocity signals at high reynolds numbers have a fractal dimension of @xmath24 , very close to the value of @xmath25 expected for gaussian processes with a @xmath26 spectral slope @xcite . for @xmath25 , the assumption of @xmath27 along with equation [ eq3 ] yields",
    "@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "one contribution of this paper is a robust way of estimating the stretching parameters without any ad - hoc prescription ; the resulting synthetic field will not only preserve the fractal dimension @xmath19 but also other fundamental properties of real turbulence .    as an exploratory example , using the fractal interpolation ifs ( equation [ eq1 ] ) , we construct a @xmath29 points long synthetic fractal series , @xmath30 , with given coarse - grained points @xmath31 and the stretching parameters used in @xcite : @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , figure 1a depicts that the synthetic series has fluctuations at all scales and it passes through all three interpolating points .",
    "next , from this synthetic series we compute higher - order structure functions ( see figure 1b for orders @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , where the @xmath35-order structure function , @xmath36 , is defined as follows : @xmath37 where , the angular bracket denotes spatial averaging and @xmath38 is a separation distance that varies in an appropriate scaling region ( known as the inertial range in turbulence ) .",
    "if the scaling exponent @xmath39 is a nonlinear function of @xmath40 , then following the convention of @xcite , the field is called _ multiaffine _ , otherwise it is termed as _",
    "monoaffine_. in this context , we would like to mention that , kolmogorov s celebrated 1941 hypothesis ( a.k.a k41 ) based on the assumption of global scale invariance in the inertial range predicts that the structure functions of order @xmath40 scale with an exponent @xmath41 over inertial range separations @xcite .",
    "deviations from @xmath42 would suggest inertial range intermittency and invalidate the k41 hypothesis .",
    "inertial range intermittency is still an unresolved issue , although experimental evidence for its existence is overwhelming @xcite . to interpret",
    "the curvilinear behavior of the @xmath43 function observed in experimental measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) , parisi and frisch @xcite proposed the _",
    "multifractal _ model , by replacing the global scale invariance with the assumption of local scale invariance .",
    "they conjectured that at very high reynolds number , turbulent flows have singularities ( almost ) everywhere and showed that the singularity spectrum is related to the structure function - based scaling exponents , @xmath43 by the legendre transformation .",
    "our numerical experiment with the stretching parameters of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath44 , revealed that the scaling exponents follow the k41 predictions ( after ensemble averaging over one hundred realizations corresponding to different initial interpolating points ) , i.e. , @xmath42 ( not shown here ) , a signature of monoaffine fields .",
    "later on , we will give analytical proof that indeed this is the case for @xmath45 .",
    "also , in this case , the pdfs of the velocity increments , @xmath46 , always portray near - gaussian ( slightly platykurtic ) behavior irrespective of @xmath38 ( see figure 1c ) .",
    "this is contrary to the observations @xcite , where , typically the pdfs of increments are found to be @xmath38 dependent and become more and more non - gaussian as @xmath38 decreases . theoretically",
    ", non - gaussian characteristics of pdfs correspond to the presence of intermittency in the velocity increments and gradients ( hence in the energy dissipation ) @xcite .    in figure 2",
    ", we plot the wavelet spectrum of this synthetic series . due to the dyadic nature of the fractal interpolation technique",
    ", the fourier spectrum will exhibit periodic modulation ( see figures 7 and 8 of @xcite ) . to circumvent this issue we make use of the ( dyadic ) discrete haar wavelet transform . following @xcite , the wavelet power spectral density function @xmath47 is defined as : @xmath48 } \\right)^2 } \\right\\rangle dx}{2\\pi \\ln \\left ( 2 \\right ) } \\\\\\ ] ] where , wavenumber @xmath49 corresponds to scale @xmath50 . the scale index @xmath51 runs from @xmath52 ( finest scale ) to @xmath53 ( coarsest scale ) .",
    "@xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the haar wavelet coefficient at scale @xmath51 and location @xmath57 , spacing in physical space and length of the spatial series , respectively .",
    "the power spectrum displays the inertial range slope of @xmath58 , as anticipated .    at this point , we would like to invoke an interesting mathematical result regarding the scaling exponent spectrum , @xmath59 , of the fractal interpolation ifs @xcite : @xmath60 where , @xmath56 = the number of anchor points @xmath61 ( in our case @xmath62 ) .",
    "the original formulation of @xcite was in terms of a more general scaling exponent spectrum , @xmath63 , rather than the structure function based spectrum @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath63 spectrum is an exact legendre tranform of the singularity spectrum in the sense that it is valid for any order of moments ( including negative ) and any singularities @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 can be reliably estimated from data by the wavelet - transform modulus - maxima method @xcite . to derive equation [ eq6 ] from the original formulation , we made use of the equality : @xmath64 , which holds for positive @xmath40 and for positive singularities of hlder exponents less than unity @xcite . in turbulence ,",
    "the most probable hlder exponent is 0.33 ( corresponding to the k41 value ) and for all practical purposes the values of hlder exponents lie between @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) . hence the use of the above equality is well justified .    equation [ eq6 ] could be used to validate our previous claim , that the parameters of @xcite give rise to a monoaffine field ( i.e. , @xmath43 is a linear function of @xmath40 ) . if we consider @xmath67 [ qed ] .",
    "equation [ eq6 ] could also be used to derive the classic result of barnsley regarding the fractal dimension of ifs .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the graph dimension ( or box - counting dimension ) is related to @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 now , using equation [ eq6 ] we get , @xmath70 . for @xmath62 , we recover equation [ eq3 ] .",
    "intuitively , by prescribing several scaling exponents , @xmath43 ( which are known apriori from observational data ) , it is possible to solve for @xmath71 from the overdetermined system of equations ( equation [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "these solved parameters , @xmath72 , along with other easily derivable ( from the given anchor points and @xmath71 ) parameters ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) in turn can be used to construct multiaffine signals .",
    "for example , solving for the values quoted by frisch @xcite : @xmath75 and @xmath76 , along with @xmath77 ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) , yields the stretching factors @xmath78 .",
    "there are altogether eight possible sign combinations for the above stretching parameter magnitudes and all of them can potentially produce multiaffine fields with the aforementioned scaling exponents .",
    "however , all of them might not be the ",
    "right \" candidate from the les - performance perspective .",
    "rigorous a - priori and a - posteriori testing of these multiaffine sgs models is needed to elucidate this issue ( see section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "we repeated our previous numerical experiment with the stretching parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "figure 3a shows the measured values ( ensemble averaged over one hundred realizations ) of the scaling exponents @xmath43 upto @xmath81 order . for comparison",
    "we have also shown the theoretical values computed directly from equation [ eq6 ] ( dashed line ) . a model proposed by she and lvque @xcite based on a hierarchy of fluctuation structures associated with the vortex filaments",
    "is also shown for comparison ( dotted line ) .",
    "we chose this particular model because of its remarkable agreement with experimental data .",
    "the she and lvque model predicts : @xmath82 .",
    "figure 3b shows the pdfs of the increments , which are quite similar to what is observed in real turbulence  for large @xmath38 the pdf is near gaussian while for smaller @xmath38 it becomes more and more peaked at the core with high tails ( see also figure 7b for the variation of flatness factors of the pdfs of increments with distance @xmath38 ) .",
    "in the case of an incompressible fluid , the spatially filtered navier - stokes equations are :    @xmath83    @xmath84 + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\tilde { u}_m \\\\   \\mbox { } m , n = 1,2,3 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 is time , @xmath86 is the spatial coordinate in the @xmath87-direction , @xmath88 is the velocity component in the @xmath87-direction , @xmath89 is the dynamic pressure , @xmath90 is the density and @xmath91 is the molecular viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the tilde @xmath92 denotes the filtering operation , using a filter of characteristic width @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "these filtered equations are now amenable to numerical solution ( les ) on a grid with mesh - size of order @xmath93 , considerably larger than the smallest scale of motion ( the kolmogorov scale ) . however , the sgs stress tensor @xmath94 in equation [ ns2 ] , defined as @xmath95 is not known .",
    "it essentially represents the contribution of unresolved scales ( smaller than @xmath93 ) to the total momentum transport and must be parameterized ( via a sgs model ) as a function of the resolved velocity field . due to strong influence of the sgs parameterizations on the dynamics of the resolved turbulence ,",
    "considerable research efforts have been made during the past decades and several sgs models have been proposed ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the eddy - viscosity model ( @xcite ) and its variants ( e.g. , the dynamic model @xcite , the scale - dependent dynamic model @xcite ) are perhaps the most widely used sgs models .",
    "they parameterize the sgs stresses as being proportional to the resolved velocity gradients .",
    "these sgs models and other standard models ( e.g. , similarity , nonlinear , mixed models ) postulate the form of the sgs stress tensors rather than the structure of the sgs fields ( @xcite ) . philosophically",
    "a very different approach would be to explicitly reconstruct the subgrid - scales from given resolved scale values ( by exploiting the statistical structures of the unresolved turbulent fields ) using a specific mathematical tool ( e.g. , the fractal interpolation technique ) and subsequently estimate the relevant sgs tensors necessary for les .",
    "the fractal model of @xcite and our proposed multiaffine model basically represent this new class of sgs modeling , also known as the `` direct modeling of sgs turbulence '' ( @xcite ) .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we have demonstrated that fit could be effectively used to generate synthetic turbulence fields with desirable statistical properties .",
    "in addition , barnsley s rigorous fractal calculus offers the ability to analytically evaluate any statistical moment of these synthetically generated fields , which in turn could be used for sgs modeling .",
    "detailed discussion of the fractal calculus is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "below , we briefly summarize the equations most relevant to the present work .",
    "let us first consider the moment integral : @xmath96^ldx}.$ ] in the present context @xmath97 , this moment integral could be viewed as @xmath98 filtering @xmath99 with the top hat filter @xmath100}$ ] . for instance , the 1-d component of the sgs stress tensor reads as :    @xmath101    barnsley ( @xcite ) proved that for the fractal interpolation ifs ( equation [ eq1 ] ) , the moment integral becomes :",
    "@xmath102    where , @xmath103    after some algebraic manipulations , the sgs stress equation at node @xmath104 becomes : @xmath105 we would like to point out that the coefficients @xmath106 are sole functions of the stretching factors @xmath71 . in other words , if one can specify the values of @xmath71 in advance , the sgs stress ( @xmath107 ) could be explicitly written in terms of the coarse - grained ( resolved ) velocity field ( @xmath108 ) weighted according to weights @xmath106 uniquely determined by @xmath71 . in table  [ tab : t1 ] , we have listed the @xmath106 values corresponding to eight stretching factor combinations , @xmath109 .",
    "it is evident that any two combinations ( @xmath110 ) and ( @xmath111 ) are simply `` mirror '' images of each other in terms of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , only four distinct multiaffine sgs models ( m1 , m2 , m3 and m4 ) could be formed from the aforementioned eight @xmath112 combinations and in each case the orderings could be chosen at random with equal probabilities . in this table , we have also included the fractal model of @xcite and the similarity model of @xcite in expanded form similar to the multiaffine models ( see the appendix for more information on standard sgs models ) .",
    "the multiaffine models and the fractal model differ slightly in terms of filtering operation .",
    "@xcite performed filtering at a scale @xmath93 ( see equation [ scotti ] ) , whereas in the case of similarity model , @xcite found that it is more appropriate to filter at @xmath98 .",
    "for the multiaffine models , we also chose to employ @xmath98 filtering scale .",
    "one noticable feature in table [ tab : t1 ] is that some combinations of @xmath71 result in strongly asymmetric weights @xmath106 . as an example , in the case of m4 with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this means that the sgs stress at any node @xmath104 would have more weight from the resolved velocity at node @xmath117 than node @xmath118 .",
    "one would expect that such an asymmetry could have serious implication in terms of sgs model performance .    in the following section , we will attempt to address this issue among others by evaluating several sgs models via the a - priori analysis approach .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , in figure 6 , we plot the mean correlation between real and modeled sgs stress and energy dissipation rates for @xmath93 = 1,2,4 and 8 m",
    ". as anticipated , for all the models , the correlation decreases with increasing filtering scale . also , the correlation of real vs. model sgs energy dissipation rates is usually higher compared to the sgs stress scenario , as noticed by other researchers .",
    "it is expected that in the abl the scaling exponent values ( @xmath43 ) would deviate from the values reported in @xcite due to near - wall effect .",
    "this means that the stretching factors @xmath71 based on the @xmath43 values we used in this work , are possibly in error .",
    "nevertheless , the overall performance of the multiaffine model is beyond our expectations .",
    "it remains to be seen how the proposed sgs scheme will perform in a - posteriori analysis and such work is currently in progress .",
    "our scheme could be easily extended to synthetic passive - scalar ( any diffusive component in a fluid flow that has no dynamical effect on the fluid motion itself , e.g. , a pollutant in air , temperature in a weakly heated flow , a dye mixed in a turbulent jet or moisture mixing in air @xcite ) field generation .",
    "the statistical and dynamical characteristics ( anisotropy , intermittency , pdfs etc . ) of passive - scalars are surprisingly different from the underlying turbulent velocity field @xcite .",
    "for example , it is even possible for the passive - scalar field to exhibit intermittency in a purely gaussian velocity field @xcite .",
    "similar to the k41 , neglecting intermittency , the kolmogorov - obukhov - corrsin ( koc ) hypothesis predicts that at high reynolds and peclet numbers , the @xmath35-order passive - scalar structure function will behave as : @xmath119 in the inertial range .",
    "experimental observations reveal that analogous to turbulent velocity , passive - scalars also exhibit anomalous scaling ( departure from the koc scaling ) .",
    "observational data also suggest that passive - scalar fields are much more intermittent than velocity fields and result in stronger anomaly @xcite .    to generate synthetic passive - scalar fields , we need to determine the stretching parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 from prescribed scaling exponents , @xmath43 .",
    "unlike the velocity scaling exponents , the published values ( based on experimental observations ) of higher - order passive - scalar scaling exponents display significant scatter .",
    "thus for our purpose , we used the predictions of a newly proposed passive - scalar model @xcite : @xmath122 .",
    "this model based on the hierarchical structure theory of @xcite shows reasonable agreement with the observed data .",
    "moreover , unlike other models , this model manages to predict that the scaling exponent @xmath43 is a nondecreasing function of @xmath40 . theoretically , this is crucial because , otherwise , if @xmath123 as @xmath124 , the passive - scalar field can not be bounded @xcite .    employing equation ( [ eq6 ] ) and the scaling exponents ( upto @xmath125-order ) predicted by the above model , we get the following stretching factors : @xmath126 .",
    "we again repeated the numerical experiment of section [ sec3 ] and selected the stretching parameter combination : @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "like before , we compared the estimated [ using equation ( 4 ) ] scaling exponents from one hundred realizations with the theoretical values [ from equation ( 6 ) ] and the agreement was found to be highly satisfactory . to check whether a generated passive - scalar field ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) possesses more non - gaussian characteristics than its velocity counterpart ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , we performed a simple numerical experiment .",
    "we generated both the velocity and passive - scalar fields from identical anchor points and also computed the corresponding flatness factors , @xmath129 , as a function of distance @xmath38 ( see figure 7b ) . comparing fig 7a with fig 3b and also from fig 7b",
    ", one could conclude that the passive - scalar field exhibits stronger non - gaussian behavior than the velocity field , in accord with the literature .",
    "in this paper , we propose a simple yet efficient scheme to generate synthetic turbulent velocity and passive - scalar fields .",
    "this method is competitive with most of the other synthetic turbulence emulator schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) in terms of capturing small - scale properties of turbulence and scalars ( e.g. , multiaffinity and non - gaussian characteristics of the pdf of velocity and scalar increments ) .",
    "moreover , extensive a - priori analyses of field measurements unveil the fact that this scheme could be effectively used as a sgs model in les .",
    "potentially , the proposed multiaffine sgs model can address two of the unresolved issues in les : it can systematically account for the near - wall and atmospheric stability effects on the sgs dynamics .",
    "of course , this would require some kind of universal dependence of the scaling exponents on both wall - normal distance and stability .",
    "quest for this kind of universality has began only recently @xcite .",

    "<S> fractal interpolation has been proposed in the literature as an efficient way to construct closure models for the numerical solution of coarse - grained navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on synthetically generating a scale - invariant subgrid - scale field and analytically evaluating its effects on large resolved scales . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an extension of previous work by developing a multiaffine fractal interpolation scheme and demonstrate that it preserves not only the fractal dimension but also the higher - order structure functions and the non - gaussian probability density function of the velocity increments . </S>",
    "<S> extensive a - priori analyses of atmospheric boundary layer measurements further reveal that this multiaffine closure model has the potential for satisfactory performance in large - eddy simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the pertinence of this newly proposed methodology in the case of passive scalars is also discussed . </S>"
