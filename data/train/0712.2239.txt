    "it is a basic ingredient in grb models that grbs are collimated in jets ( e.g. , rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "this assumption affects the estimates of both the total energy of grbs and the rate of grbs . depending on the grb jet model",

    ", jet breaks had been observed in many optical light curves ( see zeh et al .",
    "2006 for a collection of pre-_swift _  jet breaks ) and several bursts had achromatic breaks across the optical bands ( e.g. , grb  990510 , stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) , consistent with the predictions of the jet model . after the launch of _ swift _  ( gehrels et al .  2004 ) , with its rapid localization of grbs and the dedicated on - board xrt instrument , the number of grbs with jet breaks was expected to increase significantly . instead",
    ", the afterglow light curves were found to be more complicated , especially in the x - ray band , where multiple breaks or giant x - ray flares are present in more than half of the _ swift_-xrt light curves ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "the optical afterglow light curves also show complicated decay patterns both in pre-_swift _  bursts ( e.g. bersier et al .",
    "2003 ) and _ swift _  bursts ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "2007 ) . with these complications in the afterglow light curves",
    ", it can be difficult to identify a jet break . as a result ,",
    "the number of jet breaks detected in the _ swift _  era is rather small ( e.g. , grb  050525a , blustin et al .",
    "2006 , grb  060206 , stanek et al .  2007 , and grb  060526 , dai et al .",
    "2007 , and see liang et al .",
    "2007 for a comprehensive analysis ) .",
    "indeed , the absence of late time x - ray breaks can be interpreted as a challenge to the basic beaming model ( e.g. , burrows & racusin 2007a ) or the fireball model ( dado et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "while the flares are complications , the biggest problem for identifying jet breaks is the need for well - sampled , long term light curves . while almost all _ swift _  bursts have good signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) x - ray light curves at early decay times , most of the jet breaks occur at late times when the uncertainties in the xrt light curves increase significantly . in these cases ,",
    "the claim that the data are consistent with the single power - law decay does not distinguish between models , because the error - bars are so large that the data are also consistent with the broken power - law of a jet break  jet breaks are `` hidden '' in low s / n light curves or `` masked '' by additional sources of emission ( curran et al .",

    "shao et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have also proposed that jet breaks are hidden by x - ray light echos from dust scattering . in the optical bands ,",
    "the afterglow monitoring is generally sparse , in part because of the large number of bursts detected .",
    "however , the late - time afterglow can be measured accurately using large optical telescopes .",
    "in fact , all the _ swift _  bursts where jet breaks have been detected have well - sampled optical light curves ( e.g. , dai et al .",
    "2007 ) .    given the need for deep , late - time monitoring of grbs , we initiated an observing program using the newly built 8.4 meter large binocular telescope ( lbt , hill et al . 2006 ) . with 2030 minute exposures ,",
    "we are able to reach a flux limit of @xmath3@xmath4  mag in the sloan @xmath5 band .",

    "we ran daophot / allstar ( stetson 1992 ) on the deep , co - added images to obtain instrumental magnitudes of all the detected point - sources . the magnitudes of the grbs were calibrated relative to bright stars , either a single star from the usno - b catalog or several stars with sdss photometric data .",
    "we gathered other @xmath7 or @xmath8 bands data for these bursts from gcn circulars and the literature to complete the optical light curves .",

    "we used the ` rmf ` files from the standard xrt calibration distribution , generated the ` arf ` files with the _ swift_-xrt software tool and fit the x - ray spectra with ` xspec ` ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "grb  070125 ( @xmath9 , fox et al .",
    "2007 ) was relatively well observed in the optical bands , and gcn data sample between @xmath10 and @xmath11  s after the burst trigger .",

    "chandra _",
    "upper limit of @xmath32at @xmath33  s ( cenko et al .",
    "2007 ) , strongly suggesting the existence of a break in the x - ray light curve .",
    "we tested the standard afterglow / jet models ( e.g. , sari et al .",
    "1997 ; rhoads 1999 and see zhang &  2004 for a review ) using our temporal decay indices and the spectral index of @xmath34 that we derived from the x - ray data ( consistent with the estimate from burrows & racusin 2007b ) .",
    "the pre - break spectral and temporal decay indices follow the relation @xmath35 @xmath36 , suggesting that the afterglow is at the evolutionary stage of @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the typical frequency of the synchrotron radiation and the cooling frequency , respectively . at this stage ,",
    "the standard models for a constant ism density predict a post - decay index @xmath40 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 depending on whether or not sideways expansion of the jet is included .",
    "our post - decay index of @xmath24 is closest to the value expected with maximal sideways expansion .",
    "thus , grb  070125 shows a `` textbook jet break '' .",
    "although the optical light curve provides much tighter constraints on the pre and post - break decay slopes , the break is independently seen in both optical and x - ray light curves , and the consistency of the optical and x - ray light curves suggests that the break is achromatic .",
    "furthermore , the spectral and temporal decay indices before and after the break satisfy the predictions from the standard jet models .      the late - time optical light curve of grb  070311 contains a significant flare at @xmath43  s , which is immediately followed by a steep decay during the period from @xmath44 to @xmath45  s with a decay slope of @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( figure  2 upper panel ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of this flare is provided by guidorzi et al .",
    "( 2007b ) . before the flare , the four optical data points ( @xmath48@xmath49  s ) set a decay slope of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "after the flare , the two lbt data points are significantly below the extrapolation of the power - law decay before the flare , and have a decay slope of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this indicates a break in the optical light curve , with the break occurring during the flare from @xmath49  s to @xmath45  s. the post - break decay slope also suggests a relatively low electron index of @xmath54 .",
    "the xrt x - ray light curve also shows a flare very close to the optical flare , and it follows a similar steep post - flare decay slope ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the x - ray and optical light curves after the flare and the break are mutually consistent .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine whether the decay slope for the last few x - ray data points has flattened to match our lbt data given the s / n of the x - ray light curve .",
    "it is also obvious that the optical - to - x - ray flux ratio has changed before and after the flare / break , suggesting that the early x - ray light curve has a significant flux contribution from additional emission components .",
    "grb  070411 ( figure  2 lower panel ) at @xmath56 ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2007 ) has a well - sampled optical light curve at early times ( before @xmath57  s ) and the early light curve shows complicated decay patterns that are also present in many other bursts ( e.g. , grb  060206 , stanek et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the late time optical light curve ( after @xmath58  s ) , however , is not well sampled .",
    "we fit the optical light curve after @xmath59  s with a single power - law and obtained a decay index of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "although this power - law fit can not fully represent the complicated early afterglow decay , it is consistent with the late time optical light curve , where fitting the data after @xmath62  s yields @xmath63 with improved fits with @xmath64 .",
    "however , our 3@xmath65 upper limit from lbt at 10.3 days is slightly below the extrapolation of the single power - law determined from the early epochs of optical data .",
    "we also tested fitting the power - law decay to a longer time baseline that included the early optical data before @xmath59  s , and we obtained slightly flatter slopes which will lead to larger deviations from the lbt limit at 10.3 days .",
    "the x - ray light curve has a slightly steeper slope for the single power - law fit ( @xmath66 with @xmath67 ) than the optical slope .",
    "since the last two x - ray data points show possible deviations from the single power - law decay , we also tried a broken power - law fit , and obtained a comparable fit with @xmath68 ) .",
    "the optical and x - ray data set a lower limit for the jet break @xmath69  s. a break between @xmath70  s and @xmath20  s is consistent with the optical and x - ray data ; however , the late time data are still not deep enough to exclude the single power - law model .",
    "grb  070412 appears optically dark .",
    "we observed grb  070412 twice with the lbt at 2.8 hours and 8.2 days after the burst respectively .",
    "we place upper @xmath71 limits of @xmath72 for both observations .",
    "most of the other optical observations of grb  070412 also only yield upper limits .",
    "therefore , we are unable to search for the jet break in grb  070412 .",
    "the late time optical light curves for both grb  070419a and grb  070518 flattened compared to the early optical observations taken before the lbt data , indicating other emission components besides the afterglow . in grb  070518 , the extra optical flux contribution may come from the host galaxy because the lbt images show that the source is extended .",
    "grb  070419a is more interesting , since there is a late time bump in the optical light curve , consistent with a supernova bump .",
    "the details will be discussed in companion papers ( garnavich et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ; mcclelland et al . 2008 in preparation ) . in both cases , we are unable to search for a late time optical jet break .",
    "we observed six grbs afterglows using the 8.4 m lbt from 2.8 hours to 30.8 days after the burst triggers . with 2030 minute exposures , we are able to reach a flux limit of @xmath3@xmath4  mag in the sloan @xmath5 band .",
    "these observations systematically probe the late time decay of the afterglows .",
    "in particular , these observations enable us to extend the temporal baseline for measuring the jet breaks by another decade in a logarithmic time scale .    in three of the six bursts , we are unable to detected the optical jet break because of the nature of the afterglow .",
    "grb  070412 is optically dark and the late - time optical light curves of grb  070419a and grb  070518 contain other emission components from the host galaxy or a supernova which will mask a jet break . in the other three cases",
    ", we clearly detected jet breaks in grb  070125 and grb  070311 , and a break is probably required for grb  070411 .",
    "the optical jet breaks in all three cases occur at late - times , when the afterglows have faded to be fainter than @xmath73  mag .",
    "such faint breaks are not detectable without deep , late - time imaging of the afterglow .",
    "this strongly suggests that most failures to detect jet breaks are due to the lack of well - sampled afterglows either in the rate of sampling or the temporal baselines .",
    "several other well - sampled _ swift _  bursts ( e.g. , grb  060206 , stanek et al .",
    "2007 and grb  060526 , dai et al .",
    "2007 ) also clearly show jet breaks .",
    "the xrt light curves suffer from similar problems .",
    "although the xrt light curves have good s",
    "/ n at early times , the s / n decreases significantly for the time scales on which the jet breaks frequently occur .",
    "the problem is particularly severe for the last few xrt data points , where the count rate is affected by the choice of source region , background region , binning , and other effects such as flares either in the grb itself or in background sources .",
    "thus , conclusions about the existence of jet breaks with typical data are heavily dependent on the prior for fitting either a single power - law or broken power - law .",
    "this is also reflected in our sample .",
    "for example , in grb  070125 , the xrt data points can be fit with both single or broken power - laws .",
    "this problem is also present in several other bursts ( e.g. , grb  060526 , dai et al .",
    "2007 ) , where the optical data require a break while the x - ray data are only consistent with a break . in the case of grb  070125 , an upper limit from a deep _ chandra _  observation ( cenko et al . 2007 ) is below the extrapolation from the single power - law decay , independently confirming the existence of of a break .",
    "analyses of jet breaks are also affected by the complicated decay patterns . when extra emission processes , such as energy injection or flares , are important in the light curve , it is difficult to determine the forward shock emission decay slope .",
    "this may explain the case of grb  070311 , where extra emission components in both the optical and x - ray light curves may affect the slopes of the afterglows .",
    "given these problems , and the fact that almost all well - sampled bursts in the optical bands show a significant break , we argue that the basic picture that grbs are collimated is still valid . invalidating the jet model",
    "requires examples without jet breaks even at late times rather than a failure to find a break at early times .",
    "more well - sampled bursts are still needed to securely measure a large sample of jet breaks , to constrain the jet models and determine the beaming correction for grbs .",
    "accurate estimates of the beaming corrections are needed to determine the intrinsic rate of grbs and to match those rates to possible progenitor populations .",
