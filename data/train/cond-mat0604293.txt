    "this analysis is confirmed upon direct diagonalization of the representation @xmath170 which leads the 21 non - vanishing eigenvalues @xmath173 , with the multiplicities shown bold in parenthesis @xmath174 note that the normal modes in the second quintet are much `` softer '' than the rest .",
    "a similar analysis applied to the twisted cube configuration of defects leads to the following decomposition of the ( defects displacements ) representation , @xmath175 , @xmath176 where the three rigid body rotations are contained in one of the two doublets @xmath177 and in the singlet @xmath178 , which leaves five doublets and three singlets for the eigenvalues @xmath179 .",
    "direct diagonalization of @xmath175 leads four doublets , one triplet and two singlets of non - vanishing eigenvalues , @xmath180 the discrepancy between the degeneracies found by direct diagonalization on one hand and group theory on the other is caused by an accidental symmetry of the potential energy of the tilted - cube arrangement of defects .",
    "hence the first triplet is to be interpreted as the missing doublet and singlet that happen to have the same energy even if there is no symmetry reasons to expect so .",
    "the modes in the last doublet of eq.([eq : decomposetilt ] ) are the softest ."
