    "the history of nanoscale thermoelectrics dates back to the 90 s when it was shown that quantum wires and quantum wells may provide an enhancement of the figure of merit compared to the calculated value for the bulk structures @xcite .",
    "since then , studies on various quantum systems have been performed , and especially on thermoelectric efficiency @xcite .",
    "small diameter nanowires @xcite as well as quantum dot systems @xcite investigated from both theoretical and experimental point of view provide special thermoelectric characteristics as they present sharp features @xcite in the transmission functions .",
    "the nonlinear temperature regime offers new ways to obtain an enhanced thermoelectric efficiency . in this study",
    "we analyze thermoelectric effects which arise due to a temperature difference between the contacts of a device model using the scattering formalism based on the r - matrix .",
    "we present the typical features observed in resonant systems @xcite , such as the sign - change of the thermoelectric voltage by changing the chemical potential around and in - between the resonances @xcite , but also by varying the temperature of the contacts .",
    "the influence of the coupling between the quantum system and the contacts is analyzed .",
    "finally , the non - linear effects introduced by the thermoelectric field between the contacts are incorporated and the possible enhancement of the thermoelectric voltage is discussed .",
    "the two - terminal model device is a double barrier system as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure 1 ] .",
    "the leads are invariant along the transport direction and the perpendicular confinement is parabolic , with a level spacing @xmath0 mev .",
    "the contacts have distinct temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 .     which have different temperatures , @xmath3.,width=226 ]    in the framework of multi - channel coherent transport @xcite , the transmission function is calculated as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the channel index @xmath6 in lead @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath9 is formed by longitudinal wavevectors , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the transversal energy for channel @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the total energy .",
    "the scattering s - matrix is found in the r - matrix method as @xmath14 . by using the heaviside functions @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ tss ] ) only the open channels are included .",
    "the current is calculated as : @xmath16   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the open circuit thermoelectric voltage @xmath18 produced by the temperature difference @xmath19 is found by imposing a vanishing current condition , @xmath20 .",
    "the value @xmath18 is determined iteratively , by changing step - wise the relative positions of the chemical potentials , which in turn modify the internal electric field between the contacts and the scattering potential as well .",
    "we use rectangular barriers of height @xmath21 mev and width @xmath22 nm .",
    "the distance between the contacts , including the barriers , is @xmath23 nm . the effective mass of the electron is as for inas , @xmath24 .",

    "thermoelectric voltage vs. temperature difference , with the chemical potential at zero bias @xmath28 chosen below ( b ) and above ( c ) the energy of the second resonance peak.,width=302 ]    we first examine the influence of the coupling of the resonant system with the contacts by adjusting the widths of the barriers .",
    "the transmission functions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ trans_u_t](a ) , for the system with the specified barrier width @xmath29 , and , for comparison , for @xmath27 . by doubling the barrier width the coupling to the leads weakens and the energy levels are shifted at higher energies while the transmission peaks become narrower . for each system",
    "we consider two values for the chemical potential , one placed below and one above the second resonant level @xmath30 .",
    "the thermoelectric voltage as a function of temperature difference is presented in figs .",
    "[ trans_u_t](b ) and ( c ) . in order to compare the effects produced by the resonance broadening rather than energy shift ,",
    "the initial chemical potentials of the leads , i. e. at zero bias , denoted by @xmath28 , are chosen symmetrically , on both sides of the transmission maximum of the second resonance peak .",
    "the thermoelectric voltage is calculated as @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the chemical potentials of the leads , where @xmath33 is fixed and @xmath34 is adjusted until the current generated by the temperature gradient vanishes .",
    "two main features are observed .",
    "first , the sign of @xmath18 changes as the chemical potential is situated above or under the resonant level .",
    "this indicates that the thermoelectric current generated at zero bias has changed sign .",
    "second , the weaker coupling , leading to narrower transmission peaks , corresponds to an enhanced @xmath35 .",
    "the behavior can be explained as follows : in the limit of narrow peaks , the condition @xmath20 is fulfilled as the position of the chemical potential in the cold contact , @xmath34 , reaches the resonant level , @xmath30 , and the populations in the two contacts become equal ; if the resonance is broader the vanishing current condition is reached sooner as @xmath34 approaches @xmath30 , leading to smaller @xmath35 .     at a fixed @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    at a fixed @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    next , for the system with barrier width of 4.3 nm the zero - bias chemical potential is varied around the first resonance and also between the first two resonances .",
    "the two resonances occur at @xmath36 and @xmath37 mev , fig .",
    "[ figure 1](a ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ figure 3](a ) and ( b ) . in the first case",
    "the voltage curves have intersections at finite temperatures . at temperatures below the intersections @xmath35 increases as the chemical potential",
    "is set closer to the resonance maximum and at higher temperatures the opposite situation occurs .",
    "this is a consequence of the overlap of the fermi - dirac distribution functions with the finite width of the resonance . in the second case ,",
    "one also obtains a sign change for @xmath18 at a fixed temperature , because by changing the chemical potential one out of the two resonances becomes dominant .",
    "moreover , the same effect is also found at a fixed chemical potential and variable temperature , as one can see in the inset of fig .",

    "we find that if the chemical potential is close to the resonance the inclusion of @xmath41 enhances @xmath35 , whereas if @xmath28 is farther away the opposite is true .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ u_t_e](b ) for two values of the chemical potential . in the presence of the thermoelectric field the resonant levels",
    "are shifted in the same direction as the chemical potential @xmath34 . at @xmath42k ,",

    "if we set @xmath44 mev , the population at the resonance is larger and the positions of @xmath34 for the cases _ with _ and _ without _ @xmath41 become reversed and @xmath35 decreases .",
    "the thermoelectric effects which arise in the non - linear temperature regime in a multi - resonance system were discussed in the framework of coherent transport , using a scattering formalism based on the r - matrix method .",
    "we point out the typical features of sign changing of the thermoelectric voltage with respect to varying the chemical potential around a resonance and in - between two consecutive resonances . in the latter case , this sign change is also obtained by modifying the temperature difference at a fixed chemical potential .",
    "this effect is shown in the recent ref .",
