    "a sandwiched surface singularity @xmath8 is a normal surface singularity that can be projected birationally to a non - singular surface . from a more algebraic point of view ,",
    "the local ring @xmath0 of any sandwiched singularity is a birational normal extension of a two - dimensional local regular ring @xmath4 .",
    "once a sandwiched surface singularity has been fixed , in this paper we address the problem of describing the equisingularity classes of all its birational projections to a plane . the problem of classifying the germs of sandwiched surface singularities was already posed by spivakovsky .",
    "as he claims in @xcite this problem has two parts : discrete and continuous .",
    "the continuous part is to some extent equivalent to the problem of the moduli of plane curve singularities , while the main result of this paper solves completely the combinatorial part .",
    "any birational projection from a sandwiched singularity to a plane is obtained by the morphism of blowing up a complete @xmath9-primary ideal in the local ring of a regular point @xmath10 on the plane .",
    "our goal is to give all the equisingularity types of these ideals .",
    "namely , fixed a birational normal extension @xmath0 of a local regular ring @xmath11 , we describe the equisingularity type of any complete @xmath9-primary ideal @xmath12 such that its blowing - up @xmath5 has some point @xmath6 whose local ring @xmath7 is analytically isomorphic to @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", we will say that the surface @xmath13 contains the singularity @xmath0 for short , making a slight abuse of language .",
    "this is done by describing the enriques diagram of the cluster of base points of any such ideal @xmath3 : such a diagram will be called an enriques diagram for the singularity @xmath0 . recall that an enriques diagram is a tree together with a binary relation ( proximity ) representing the topological equivalence classes of clusters of points in the plane ( see  [ ed - dualg ] ) .",
    "previous works by spivakovsky @xcite and mhring @xcite describe a type of enriques diagram that exists for any given sandwiched surface singularity ( detailed in  2 ) and provide other types mostly in the case of cyclic quotients ( see @xcite 2.7 ) and minimal singularities ( see @xcite 2.5 ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 1 is devoted to recalling some definitions concerning the language of infinitely near points , sandwiched surface singularities and graphs .",
    "fundamental for our purpose will be the notion of enriques diagram , introduced in @xcite . in section 2 , after some technical results , we introduce the concept of _ contraction _ for a sandwiched surface singularity @xmath0 . by a contraction we mean the resolution graph @xmath14 of @xmath0 ( a sandwiched graph , as introduced in @xcite ) enriched by some proximities between their vertices , these proximities being compatible with the weights of the graph .",
    "fixed a sandwiched graph , the problem of finding the whole list of possibilities for such proximities is the hard part of our work .",
    "this is achieved in section 3 , by proving that any contraction for @xmath14 may be recovered from some contraction of the graph obtained from @xmath14 by removing one end .",
    "this fact is the key result in order to describe a procedure to obtain all the contractions for @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we explain how to complete contractions in order to obtain any enriques diagram for @xmath0 .",

    "they also thank m. spivakovsky for the conversations held on this topic .",
