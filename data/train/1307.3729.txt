    "it is well known @xcite that classical transition state theory@xcite ( tst ) corresponds to taking the short time ( @xmath0 ) limit of the classical flux - side time - correlation function , and that this can be done because this function is odd and discontinuous about @xmath1 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this convenient behaviour has not seemed to carry over into quantum rate - theory , @xcite where the various forms of quantum flux - side time - correlation function tend smoothly to zero in the @xmath0 limit ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is a pity , because it is still impossible to evaluate the quantum flux - side time - correlation function at @xmath2 for all but the simplest systems.@xcite a vast number of methods have been developed in an attempt to circumvent this problem .",
    "one type of method is to include quantum corrections into classical tst , @xcite the most famous instance of this being the wigner - eyring formula .",
    "@xcite a more systematic approach is to use semi - classical theories @xcite ( some of which we discuss below ) , or the quantum instanton approach .",
    "@xcite however , there is one approach @xcite that is especially relevant to this article , which is to note that classical tst takes the form of a free - energy combined with a flux factor , and then to exploit the fact that it is relatively easy to compute a quantum free energy , using ` ring - polymer ' path - integration .",
    "@xcite    this last approach has turned out to be extremely powerful .",
    "its most general formulation is ring - polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd ) tst , @xcite in which the free - energy is obtained by constraining the ring - polymers using a general dividing surface .",
    "for reasonably symmetric reaction barriers , this dividing surface can be made a function of just the polymer - bead centroids .",
    "@xcite this ` centroid - tst ' approach was the earliest form of the theory , but it breaks down for asymmetric reaction barriers . the more general rpmd - tst approach is usually implemented indirectly , @xcite as it is more convenient to simulate the system as a classical rate - process taking place in a fictitious , extended , space of ring - polymers , and to exploit the property that the resulting rate is an approximation to the rpmd - tst rate .",
    "@xcite this approach has recently allowed approximate quantum rates to be computed for hydride - transfer in enzymes @xcite and for condensed - phase electron - transfer .",
    "@xcite    to date , however , there has been no first - principles derivation of the rpmd - tst rate , beyond proving that it interpolates between various limits .",
    "it gives the exact classical and parabolic - barrier rates at high temperatures , @xcite and is close to the ` i m f ' instanton rate @xcite at low temperatures .",
    "note that the ` i m f ' instanton rate has itself not been derived from quantum rate - theory ; it gives good approximations to the rate in the deep - tunnelling regime , and is probably best regarded as a rough interpolation between miller s steepest - descent instanton theory@xcite and classical rate theory .",
    "the aim of this article ( part i ) and of the forthcoming part ii is to show that , contrary to what has just been said , there does exist a form of quantum flux - side time - correlation function with a non - zero @xmath3  limit , which limit does give the exact rate in the absence of recrossing , and which , remarkably , is _ identical _ to rpmd - tst . this article will focus on deriving the @xmath3  limit and establishing that it is equal to rpmd - tst .",
    "part ii will prove that the rpmd - tst rate is equal to the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing .    to obtain these new results",
    ", we will use the same overall strategy that miller and co - workers@xcite used to first obtain quantum rate - theory ; i.e.  we will derive the theory for quantum scattering systems , because rate - theory is then formally exact ( since the flux - side time - correlation function has a plateau extending to @xmath4 ) , and hence straightforward to derive .",
    "we will then assume that the theory also applies to condensed - phase rate - processes , subject to the usual caveat of there being a separation in timescales between barrier crossing and equilibration.@xcite hence although we will make use of quantum scattering theory as a derivational tool , the quantum tst results that we obtain from it are applicable generally .",
    "note that this article is almost completely free of quantum scattering theory , but it will appear in quite some detail in part ii .",
    "an important theme running through this article is that of _ linearization _ , by which we mean use of the linearized semi - classical initial - value representation .",
    "@xcite in this approach , feynman paths in the forward and backward real - time propagators are assumed to cancel out unless they are very close together , such that the difference in their actions can be expanded to linear order in position .",
    "this approximation has the effect of removing all real - time feynman paths , except the forward - backward pairs that lie along classical trajectories joining the start and end points , which reduces the time - correlation function to its classical wigner approximation .",
    "now , as @xmath0 , linearization becomes _ exact _ , meaning that the time - evolution of the quantum flux - side time - correlation function becomes entirely classical in this limit ( whereas the statistics , of course , remain quantal ) .",
    "we will show that this property gives rise to a @xmath3  quantum tst .",
    "the article is structured as follows : after summarising some basic aspects of classical tst in sec .",
    "ii , we describe in sec .",
    "iii how the exact linearization of the dynamics in the @xmath3  limit can be used to explain why the standard flux - side time - correlation function tends smoothly to zero as @xmath5 , and how one can modify it to make it discontinuous instead .",
    "this gives rise to a quantum tst which is identical to an expression introduced on heuristic grounds by wigner , @xcite but which gives bad quantum statistics at low temperatures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qtststat ] , we show that the correct ( i.e.  positive - definite ) quantum statistics can be obtained using a generalized kubo - transform , which gives a flux - side time - correlation function that is invariant to imaginary - time translation ; the @xmath3  limit of this expression is identical to rpmd - tst . in sec .",
    "v we point out that the results of secs .",
    "iii and iv , which were derived in one - dimension to simplify the algebra , can be generalized immediately to multi - dimensions .",
    "section vi concludes the article .",
    "here , we discuss some well - known ideas from classical rate theory , which we will apply in secs [ sec : wigner ] and [ sec : qtststat ] to quantum rate theory ( where their use is less intuitive ) . note that this section considers an @xmath6-dimensional classical system , whereas secs .",
    "[ sec : wigner][sec : qtststat ] consider a 1-dimensional quantum system .",
    "this is because the @xmath3  limit of the latter is similar to the @xmath3  limit of a multi - dimensional classical system .",
    "( extension of the quantum theory to multi - dimensions is straightforward and is left until sec .  [ sec : multid ] ) .",
    "the exact classical rate coefficient @xmath7 is given by@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ( classical ) reactant partition function , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the side - side time - correlation function @xmath12h[s({\\bf q}_t)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath13 is the flux - side time - correlation function @xmath14 { \\dot s({\\bf q},{\\bf p})}h[s({\\bf q}_t)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath1 time - derivative of @xmath15 is defined to be @xmath16 and is the flux through the dividing surface at time @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the position at time @xmath19 of a classical particle that started at @xmath20 at time @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath13 is discontinuous in the @xmath3  limit , behaving as in fig .  1 , and that the classical tst rate coefficient @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 in the absence of recrossing",
    ", @xmath13 would remain constant for all time , and thus @xmath21 would be the exact rate . in a real system ,",
    "for which there is recrossing , @xmath21 is a strict upper bound , since recrossing of the dividing surface necessarily reduces the rate .",
    "now , it is useful to clarify why @xmath13 is discontinuous at @xmath1 , since this mathematical oddity is essential to the existence of classical tst and is the thing that we need to introduce into quantum rate theory if we are to obtain a true quantum tst . to take the @xmath3  limit of @xmath13",

    "of course the reason this happens is that the flux and side dividing surfaces are the _ same function _ @xmath15 . if we choose different functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the dividing surfaces , we obtain @xmath29h[s_2({\\bf q}_t)]&=\\delta[s_1({\\bf q})]\\,h\\!\\left[{\\dot s_2}({\\bf q},{\\bf p})\\ , t+s_2({\\bf q})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\&\\ne \\delta[s_1({\\bf q})]\\,h[{\\dot s_2({\\bf q},{\\bf p})}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e.  the momentum filter switches off smoothly as @xmath3  ( because the contribution of @xmath30 inside the heaviside function is gradually turned off as @xmath0 ) .",
    "the property that @xmath27 and @xmath28 must be the same to give a non - zero @xmath3  limit is not restricted to the boltzmann distribution ; any ( non - pathological ) distribution of @xmath31 will also behave this way . as a result , we can use the analysis just given ( which is trivial in the context of classical rate theory ) to modify the quantum flux - side time - correlation function so that it also is non - zero in the @xmath3  limit .",
    "to simplify the algebra , we consider a 1-dimensional quantum scattering system with mass @xmath32 , hamiltonian @xmath33 , and a potential @xmath34 which tends asymptotically to fixed limits , and has a barrier .",
    "however , we emphasise that everything we derive below generalises immediately to multi - dimensional systems ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : multid ] ) , and also applies to condensed - phase systems ( see the comments in the introduction ) .",

    "now let us consider the @xmath3  limit .",
    "we rewrite @xmath41 as @xmath42 ( where the reason for the subscripts will become clear shortly ) .",

    "we obtain a time - correlation function involving a wigner transform of the boltzmannized flux operator , in which the dynamics is now classical ( i.e.  @xmath48 ) . at finite times",
    "linearization is approximate , but in the @xmath3  limit taken here it is clearly exact .",
    "the statistics in the @xmath3  limit is therefore quantum , but the dynamics is classical .",

    "equation [ eq : mil2b ] shows why @xmath41 tends smoothly to zero as @xmath64 : it is because @xmath41 is equivalent to the short - time classical flux of a two dimensional system in which the flux and side dividing surfaces are _ different _ functions of the coordinates @xmath65 ; more formally , these surfaces are different functions of ( imaginary - time ) path - integral space .",
    "it follows from the above that if the flux and side dividing surfaces are the _ same _ function of path - integral space then the flux - side time - correlation function must have a discontinuity at @xmath1 , and thus a non - zero @xmath3  limit .",

    "( [ eq : kwm ] ) in the temperature range ( @xmath89 ) in which it does work , since these are the properties of a well - behaved @xmath3  quantum tst , and are shared by the more general @xmath3  quantum tst that we derive in sec .",
    "[ sec : qtststat ] .",
    "first , @xmath73}(t)$ ] is time - independent for a free - particle , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : kwm ] ) thus gives the exact rate .",
    "the same is true for a parabolic barrier , provided the dividing surface is chosen such that @xmath90 ( and also that @xmath89  we return to the case of @xmath91 below ) .",
    "it is straightforward ( though algebraically messy ) to prove this last result : one uses the properties that eq .",
    "( [ eq : kwm ] ) is exact for a parabolic barrier@xcite ( with @xmath90 and @xmath89 ) , and that linearization gives the exact quantum dynamics for a parabolic barrier;@xcite it then follows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfsnf ] ) is time - independent , since a classical trajectory originating at @xmath90 can not recross the dividing surface .",
    "second , for any realistic system , eq .  ( [ eq : cfsnf ] ) will not be time - independent because there will be some recrossing of the optimal dividing surface .",
    "just as in classical tst , therefore , one needs to locate a dividing surface which eliminates most of the recrossing , and there are some systems ( e.g. diffusive reactions ) for which no such surface exists , and which therefore can not be adequately described by quantum tst .",
    "third , unlike classical tst , quantum tst is not a strict upper bound to the exact rate .",
    "this is because , in a quantum system , recrossing of the dividing surface does not necessarily reduce the rate ; real - time coherence effects may in fact increase it , as is happening to a small extent in fig",
    "hence one can only apply quantum tst when it is safe to assume that real - time coherence has a small effect on the rate , in which case the @xmath3  limit gives a _ good approximation _ to an upper bound .",
    "one can then proceed ( almost ) as in classical tst , choosing the ( approximately ) optimal dividing surface to be the one that minimises the tst rate , which is what was done in the calculation of fig .",
    "3a . moving the dividing surface any appreciable distance away from the ( approximately ) optimal dividing surface causes the quantum tst rate to become exponentially too large [ see fig .",
    "3c ] , just as in classical tst .",
    "this restriction that quantum tst is only applicable if real - time coherence effects are small is only to be expected : if coherence effects are large , one has no choice but to compute the real - time quantum dynamics.@xcite      we now return to why the quantum tst expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kwm ] ) breaks down below temperatures of @xmath87 .",
    "it is clear that the time - correlation function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfsnf ] ) still gives the exact rate in the @xmath92 limit ( see fig .",
    "the fault in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfsnf ] ) is therefore not in the dynamics : it is a failure in the treatment of the quantum statistics .",
    "we can analyse the statistics by discretising imaginary time , such that the statistical part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfsnf ] ) is written as @xmath93\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times{\\big < \\ , q_{n}|e^{-\\beta_n{\\hat h}}|q^\\ddag+\\delta_1/2 \\ , \\big > } \\label{eq : linpol } \\ ] ] where @xmath94 . in the @xmath95 limit , this becomes @xmath96 the right - hand side is a classical partition function for a polymer ` string ' connecting the points @xmath97 .",
    "the quantum statistics is dominated by fluctuations of the polymer string around the minima on its potential energy surface .    to characterize these minima , we can use what we know about stationary points on the related ring - polymer potential surface .",
    "@xcite in a ring polymer , the stationary points are discretized periodic orbits on the inverted molecular potential energy surface @xmath98 , with period @xmath99 .",
    "there is a cross - over temperature @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the imaginary frequency at the top of the barrier , such that when @xmath102 the system has insufficient time to complete an orbit and thus the only stationary point is the ` trivial orbit ' , in which the system remains at rest , at the bottom of @xmath98 ( i.e.  on the barrier top ) for a time @xmath103 ; when @xmath104 , the system can complete an orbit , which is referred to as the ` instanton ' .",
    "this cross - over marks the transition between shallow tunnelling , where the system penetrates the parabolic tip of the barrier , and deep tunnelling , where it follows a more delocalised path ( and can cut corners@xcite etc . ) .",
    "another way to think of cross - over is that , above @xmath88 , the springs are too stiff to allow the polymer to stretch over the top of the barrier ; below @xmath88 , the springs are sufficiently weak that the polymer can stretch over the barrier and relax into the geometry corresponding to the discretized instanton orbit . for the special case of a parabolic barrier , there is nothing in the ring - polymer potential to stop the polymer stretching indefinitely below @xmath88 , where the rate is therefore undefined .    for the linear polymer in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linpol ] ) , the end - points are constrained to be symmetric about @xmath105 , so the stationary points are now classical trajectories ( on @xmath98 ) connecting the end points in time @xmath99 ; they need not be periodic orbits . also , the polymer is not a ring , but a string , and so the force constant associated with relaxation into an instanton is half that of a ring - polymer . as a result ,",
    "the polymer relaxes over the top of the barrier at @xmath106 , to form half a periodic orbit ( or a ` half - instanton ' ) .",
    "it is these half - instantons that cause the rate to be negative in the eckart barrier calculation of fig .",
    "figure  4 plots the quantum boltzmann matrix used to obtain fig .",
    "the two peaks at @xmath107 a.u .  are produced by two half - instantons , which are minima on the linear - polymer potential surface.@xcite it is clear that these half instantons , and the fluctuations around them which dominate the boltzmann matrix , are spurious .",
    "@xcite for a parabolic barrier , the behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kwm ] ) below @xmath106 is even more disastrous , since the rate becomes undefined in the range @xmath108 ( where it should be finite ) .",

    "we have constrained the quantum boltzmann distribution in such a way as to make it non - positive - definite . at high temperatures ,",
    "the errors in the statistics are small .",
    "but below @xmath87 , the errors are big enough to dominate the tst rate , giving negative or undefined rates as just described",
    ". it will become clear below that the reason the statistics is non - positive - definite is that the single - point constraint has destroyed the invariance of the quantum boltzmann distribution to imaginary - time translation .",

    "we got around this by using a large basis ( a total of 32768 grid - points between @xmath223 a.u . ) , which gave the correct behaviour down to about @xmath224 fs .",
