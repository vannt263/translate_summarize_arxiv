    "the problems encountered in relativistic high energy physics and astrophysics are local problems about causally unconnected parts ( in a classical relativistic sense ) of the system rather than about the whole system . in both cases ,",
    "the resolution of probing system is much smaller than the size of the systems being observed .",
    "the overall feature of the system at any given time ( in any specific reference frame ) is generated by first synchronizing clocks , next measuring wanted physical quantity within each part of the system _ independently _ at the time that is _ considered _ the same within the _ allowed accuracy _ and then reassemble the whole picture of the system using the bits of local information about the system measured ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm ] ) .",
    "there is no guarantee in quantum world that the refined image of the system obtained under such a procedure should be identical to that of the one obtained by doing a low resolution global measurement , in which a uniform ( in space - time ) external field is exerted on the system and the response of the system to the external field is measured , like the ones that determine the bulk properties of the system frequently studied in non - relativistic condensed matter system .",
    "such a subtle difference is believed to originate from the quantum interference effects which are best illustrated by the classical double slit experiments where when one does not care which slit the microscopic particle ( e.g. , an electron ) go , there is a interference pattern on the screen behind the double slits , but as long as one determines which slit the microscopic particle went through , the interference pattern disappears . _",
    "the interference pattern can not be obtained by summing over the two pictures obtained separately by knowing exactly which slit the microscopic particle go_. such a behavior is no longer a theoretical conjecture but a experimental fact which is demonstrated recently by experiments from different groups around the world .",
    "the same difference should manifest in quantum field theory in the local versus global observables .",
    "the importance of an understanding of such a difference has not been appreciated due to the lack of a comparing theoretical frame - work . a consistent local theory for quantum field theory at finite field strength ( leading to finite density of matter and energy )",
    "is constructed @xcite not only for understand such a difference but also for describing the problems raised in high energy physics and astrophysics .",
    "i shall discuss one of the problems in constructing a local finite density quantum field theory for fermions in this talk , those who are interested in the original works can read the papers @xcite .",
    "the particular problem that i am going to to discuss here is about the necessity of including fermionic statistical block effects in the chiral symmetry breaking phase of light quark system .",
    "but before we can discuss the problem , let us first brief review what the local theory should be look like at the formal level and what is its most transparent properties .",
    "the non - relativistic many body theory for a system with variable particle number is based upon the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) @xcite .",
    "the partition function for the system in the gce is related to its hamiltonian @xmath1 and its particle number @xmath2 in the following way @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the volume of the system , @xmath5 with @xmath6 the temperature and @xmath7 is the chemical potential .",
    "the limit @xmath8 is the thermodynamical limit in which the equilibrium statistical mechanics describes physical many body system at equilibrium .",
    "a measurement of the ground state fermion number density in gce which is given by @xmath9 corresponds to a global measurement since the chemical potential is independent of both space and time .",
    "global measurements are most frequently carried out in condensed matter systems with a size smaller than or comparable to our human body ( of order 1 meter ) which permit us to study the system `` as a whole '' .",
    "the gce is highly successful in describing these situations .",
    "questions posed by high - energy physics , astrophysics and cosmology are somewhat different .",
    "the size of the systems compared to that of the resolution of the measuring apparatus are normally much larger , therefore one actually is capable of study either more details of the probed systems due to the reduction of the wave length of the probing system or only small fraction of the probed system due to the impossibility of covering the whole probed system by the probing system at the _ same time_. one is in effect doing local measurements in these later situations .",
    "local measurements in quantum field theory are realized by exerting an external local field to the system at the space - time points interested , and , the measured quantity is deduced from the response of the system to the external field . for finite density systems ,",
    "a lorentz 4-vector local field @xmath10 , called the primary statistical gauge field , is introduced .",
    "the ground state expectation value of fermion number density can be expressed as the functional derivative @xmath11 with @xmath12 a functional of @xmath13 .",
    "it corresponds to a local measurement in the ground state at the space - time point x.    for a concrete discussion of the consequences of substituting the global chemical potential in non - relativistic many body theory for the local primary statistical gauge field , let us consider an lagrangian of the following form @xmath14 with @xmath15 the fermion mass , @xmath16 the lagrangian density of boson fields of the system and @xmath17 the interaction between the boson and fermion fields .",

    "the most obvious one is related to the fact that a unbounded @xmath56 integration , which is done first , corresponds to an arbitrary choice of a equal - time hypersurface in space - time with zero thickness .",
