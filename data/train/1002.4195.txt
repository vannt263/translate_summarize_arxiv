    "supernova ( sn ) 1987a , with its surrounding triple ring structure is one of the best known astronomical images from the 1990 s .",
    "however , the origin of these spectacular rings is still somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is believed that the material in these rings was ejected by the sn progenitor star @xmath020,000 years ago .",
    "also , the elemental abundances derived for the inner ring ( _ e.g. _ , lundqvist & fransson 1996 hereafter lf96 ) strongly support a stellar origin for the ring material .",
    "therefore , studies of the ring structure can also provide additional information on the progenitor star of sn 1987a which has been shown by detailed pre - explosion observations to have been initially a 14 - 20 m@xmath6 star and a blue supergiant of b3i spectral type at the time of the explosion ( for review and references see smartt et al .",
    "recently , binary merger models ( _ e.g. _ , morris & podsiadlowski 2007 ) have proposed to explain the blue supergiant nature of the sn progenitor as well as the formation of the triple ring system .",
    "a rapidly rotating single star progenitor has been suggested as an alternative origin for the ring structure ( _ e.g. _ , chita et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the gas in the ring structure was photoionized by the extreme uv and soft x - ray sn flash with the first narrow optical and uv emission lines detected a few months after the explosion ( wampler et al .",
    "1988 ; fransson et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the gas then cooled and recombined until the start of the collision between the expanding sn ejecta and the material of the inner ring .",
    "the first evidence that the ejecta / ring impact had started came from radio ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 ) and x - ray emission ( gorenstein , hughes & tucker 1994 ) in mid-1990 .",
    "the first signs at optical wavelengths were detected in hubble space telescope ( hst ) images from 1995 ( lawrence et al . 2000 ) .",
    "recent high resolution x - ray images ( ng et al . 2009 ) from 2008 indicate that the sn blast wave has already overtaken the inner ring .",
    "the uv - optical emission line fluxes from the inner ring have been modeled by lf96 up to @xmath02000 days from the explosion .",
    "they found gas densities ranging from 6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath4 to 3.3 @xmath1 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and derived the following relative ( ratio by number of atoms ) abundances : he / h = 0.25 @xmath7 0.05 , n / c = 5.0 @xmath7 2.0 and n / o = 1.1 @xmath7 0.4 with an overall metal ( _ i.e. _ c , n , and o ) abundance of 0.30 @xmath7 0.05 times solar .",
    "hst data up to @xmath9 days were analyzed by lundqvist & sonneborn ( 1997 ) and showed evidence of densities in the ring down to @xmath02 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath4 .",
    "abundance estimates for metals in the sn 1987a csm have recently also been made from x - ray observations ( zhekov et al .",

    "these observations yielded a similar n / o abundance as found by lf96 , although the absolute c+n+o abundance is lower , and they also add abundance estimates of heavier metals .",
    "the main aim of the present study is to investigate the density structure and the elemental abundances of the inner ring using optical emission line fluxes from the entire era before the collision between the sn ejecta and the ring material started to dominate these fluxes . to do this",
    ", we obtained optical spectra of the sn 1987a csm with the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) between @xmath01400 and @xmath04300 days and with the very large telescope ( vlt ) between @xmath05000 and @xmath07500 days from the explosion .",
    "we also collected all the available optical / near - ir absolute line fluxes of the circumstellar ring from the literature for epochs between @xmath0300 and @xmath02000 days .",
    "this data - set covers epochs between 300 days and @xmath07500 days from the sn explosion _",
    "i.e. _ the entire era from the time when the emission from the inner ring first became visible at optical and near - ir wavelengths until and beyond the first signs of the collision between the sn ejecta and the inner ring were detected at these wavelengths .",
    "preliminary studies of the line light curves between @xmath0300 and @xmath04300 have already been presented in mattila ( 2002 ) and mattila et al .",
    "the late time vlt observations have also been reported in grningsson et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) . in section 2",
    "we describe the aat and vlt observations , data reductions and the available line fluxes from the literature . in section 3 , the line light curves are modeled with a photoionization model to estimate the density structure and elemental abundance of the inner ring .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the results and in section 5 present conclusions from this study .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of sn 1987a were carried out using the royal greenwich observatory ( rgo ) spectrograph on the aat between 1991 and 1998 ( for full details of the aat observations see table 1 ) .",
    "data were obtained at four different epochs : 1416 , 1680 , 1991 , and 4309 days post - explosion . at each epoch , the observations comprised a brief , wide slit integration , and a longer duration , narrow slit integration ( see col . 6 in table 1 ) with spectral resolutions of fwhm @xmath0300 - 600 km  s@xmath10 and @xmath0150 km  s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the sn observations spanned air masses @xmath01.5 to @xmath03.0 , making accurate flux calibration quite challenging .",
    "we therefore carried out the observations with the slit position angle ( pa , col 5 in table 1 ) set to be roughly the same as the line joining stars 2 and 3 ( see fig .",
    "this meant that star 2 lay well within the wide slit and so could be used to correct for the variable transmission of the atmosphere .",
    "however , an additional problem was that , since the slit pa was generally not at the parallactic angle , when the narrow slit was used , atmospheric refraction could introduce wavelength - dependent vignetting ( _ e.g. _ , filippenko 1982 ) of the ring spectra",
    ". moreover , the magnitude of this effect differed from that experienced by star 2 since the latter lay nearer the edge of the slit .",
    "consequently , the fluxing uncertainty introduced could be as large as @xmath740@xmath11 .    ) and width ( 5.3  corresponding to 1.3 pc at the distance of the lmc ) of the wide slit used for the aat observations on dec .",
    "1994 are indicated .",
    "north is up and east is to the left.,height=302 ]    data reduction was carried out using standard iraf routines and for the 2d frames included the overscan correction , bias subtraction , flat fielding ( to correct for fringing ) and removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the background subtraction was performed using the iraf background task in two steps , first to remove the emission of atmospheric lines and then the more complex large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) background .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed for the background subtracted 2d frames using cuar arc lamp spectra observed together with the sn .",
    "an unweighted extraction was performed for the ring spectra because under the aat seeing conditions the spectra of the two nearby stars were always blended with the spectrum of the ring making the use of any weighting algorithms unreliable . for the wide - slit observations , extraction apertures were large enough to include the flux from both the two nearby stars and the inner ring ( see fig .",
    "1 ) _ i.e. _ all the ring flux was included .",
    "for the narrow slit observations smaller extraction apertures were used in order to maximise the s / n of the ring spectra and to avoid contamination by the strong stellar absorption lines in stars 2 and 3 prominent at wavelengths shorter than @xmath05000   .",
    "the telluric correction was performed using spectra of the low metallicity f5 star hd 26169 located close to sn 1987a on the sky .",
    "this star has only a very few stellar features apparent in its spectrum which were removed by interpolation .",
    "one of the spectrophotometric standards eg 21 , ltt 1788 , ltt 2415 or ltt 3218 ( hamuy et al .",
    "1994 ) was observed with each of the sn observations and was used for the relative flux calibration of the sn spectra .",
    "examples of the reduced narrow - slit spectra are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    the sn observations spanned airmass values between @xmath01.5 and @xmath03.0 . at such high airmasses",
    "some of the observations are likely to be affected by clouds if the night is not completely clear .",
    "therefore , each wide slit spectrum was checked for the effects of attenuation by clouds , and a correction applied to the affected spectra .",
    "this was carried out by making use of the nearby star 2 ( for full details see mattila 2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum of star 2 was extracted from each of the wide slit observations and its continuum was fitted with a low order polynomial .",
    "the continuum with the highest counts ( which also had the expected shape for a stellar continuum ) was selected to represent the unattenuated star 2 continuum . to compensate also for possible uncertainties in the relative fluxing",
    "a correction curve was created for each wide slit spectrum by dividing the real star 2 continuum by the observed one .",
    "the extracted wide slit sn spectra were then multiplied by the corresponding correction curves . in the aat spectra the narrow lines arising from the inner ring were interactively fitted with a gaussian profile on top of the broad sn ejecta lines .",
    "as these lines have very different widths ( _ e.g. _ , see fig .",
    "2 ) the sn ejecta lines could be treated as a local background for the narrow csm lines and fitted with a low order polynomial on the two sides of each narrow line .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties in the absolute fluxes measured from the wide slit spectra are @xmath0@xmath715% . for the narrow slit spectra",
    "there is also another source of uncertainty in the relative fluxes due to the differential refraction of light in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the flux calibration of the narrow slit spectra and estimation of the associated uncertainties are described in sect .",
    "the aat observations were obtained with the seeing ranging between @xmath01 `` and @xmath03 '' and so the inner ring spectra were always significantly contaminated by light from stars 2 and 3 located 2.9  and 1.6  , respectively , from the sn ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in general , the csm emission lines could be easily distinguished from the continuum originating from the sn and the two stars . however , star 3 is a be star showing strong h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 emission together with optical variability of @xmath00.5 magnitudes ( wang et al .",
    "consequently , it could affect significantly the observed line fluxes from the inner ring , especially at the later epochs when the ring was fainter . to assess and correct for possible star 3 contamination , we searched the hst archive for suitable optical spectroscopic ( stis ) and photometric ( wfpc2 ) observations ( see table 2 ) covering the epochs of our aat observations .",

    "the chief differences between the lf96 models and those in the current paper are mainly due to the difference in density distribution and that we now concentrate on data at later epochs . in lf96",
    "we could not constrain gas with densities lower than @xmath27  @xmath4 , whereas our study here is mainly sensitive to lower densities .",
    "we note that both the study of lf96 and x - ray studies are likely to probe the gas on the inside of the ring where the ring densities probably are higher than further out ( cf . the discussion in lundqvist & sonneborn 1997 ) . here , we have concentrated on the low - density gas and have assumed that this is not shielded from the uv flash by high - density gas closer to the supernova . this may not be true for all low - density gas and thus there could be a systematic difference between lf96 and the present analysis .",

    "our results are roughly 1.6 times higher than found for the lmc , and about 60% of the modern solar values .",
    "the explanation could be due to the high helium abundance in sn 1987a .",
    "a simple test is to use lmc abundances of metals and helium , and to elevate these compared to hydrogen with the same factor as the he / h ratio in the inner ring of sn 1987a , i.e. , with a factor of @xmath35 to simulate the loss of hydrogen from the surface of the progenitor .",
    "doing so , the ( c+n+o)/(h+he ) abundance would be @xmath36 , i.e. , nearly the same as we found for the inner ring of sn 1987a .",
    "the iron abundance was estimated based on three [ fe  ii ] lines and one [ fe  iii ] line yielding 0.20 @xmath7 0.11 times the solar value of anders & grevese ( 1989 ) , which is consistent with the findings from the x - ray studies ( dewey et al .",

    "our estimates for the neon , argon and calcium abundances are all based only on a single ( doublet in the case of ar and ne ) emission line and therefore , these abundances could be considered less reliable . however , for neon and argon we also compared late time ( post 5000 day ) light curves of [ ne  iv ] @xmath194714 + 4726 and [ ar  iv ] @xmath194711 + 4740 lines with the models ( see fig . 8) . for this",

    "3.2 ) giving a satisfactory match at @xmath05000 days for all the six lines modeled .",
    "also , the evolution of the [ ne  iii ] doublet is expected to behave similar to the strong and well - sampled [ o  iii ] doublet .",
    "this gives us more confidence on the estimated neon and argon abundances and we conclude that they are probably accurate to a similar level as found for iron , _ i.e. _ , @xmath7@xmath050@xmath11 . within these uncertainties",
    "we find that the abundances of both argon and neon are consistent with their lmc values and also with the abundances found in the x - ray studies of the inner ring .",
    "however , our abundances for calcium and sulphur are both higher than the ones found for the lmc and for the ring in the x - ray studies .",
    "we note that both the [ s  ii ] and [ ca  ii ] lines used in our study are prone to the shielding effect discussed in sect . 3.2 for [ o  i ] , and we should thus only consider our abundances for s and ca as upper limits .",

    "our iron abundance based on optical and near - ir lines is 0.20 @xmath7 0.11 times solar which is within the range of the estimates for the lmc and therefore does not indicate a strong depletion onto dust grains in the ring material .",

    "<S> we present optical spectroscopic data of the inner circumstellar ring around sn 1987a from the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) and the very large telescope ( vlt ) between @xmath01400 and @xmath05000 days post - explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we also assembled the available optical and near - infrared line fluxes from the literature between @xmath0300 and @xmath02000 days . </S>",
    "<S> these line light curves were fitted with a photoionization model to determine the density structure and the elemental abundances for the inner ring . </S>",
    "<S> we found densities ranging from 1@xmath110@xmath2 to 3@xmath110@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 and a total mass of the ionized gas of @xmath05.8 @xmath1 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 within the inner ring . </S>",
    "<S> abundances inferred from the optical and near - infrared data were also complemented with estimates of lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ) based on ultraviolet lines . this way we found an he / h - ratio ( by number of atoms ) of 0.17 @xmath7 0.06 which is roughly 30% lower than previously estimated and twice the solar and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) value . </S>",
    "<S> we found an n / o - ratio of 1.5 @xmath7 0.7 , and the total ( c+n+o)/(h+he ) abundance about 1.6 times its lmc value or roughly 0.6 times the most recent solar value . </S>",
    "<S> an iron abundance of 0.20 @xmath7 0.11 times solar was found which is within the range of the estimates for the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> we also present late time ( @xmath05000 - 7500 days ) line light curves of [ o  iii ] , [ ne  iii ] , [ ne  iv ] , [ ar  iii ] , [ ar  iv ] , and [ fe  vii ] from observations with the vlt . </S>",
    "<S> we compared these with model fluxes and found that an additional @xmath8 atoms @xmath4 component was required to explain the data of the highest ionization lines . </S>",
    "<S> such low density gas is expected in the h ii - region interior to the inner ring which likely extends also to larger radii at higher latitudes ( out of the ring plane ) . at epochs later than @xmath05000 days our models underproduce the emission of most of these lines as expected due to the contribution from the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the ring . </S>"
