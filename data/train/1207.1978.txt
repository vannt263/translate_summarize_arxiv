    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interaction has been remarkably successful in describing physics below the fermi scale and is in good agreement with the most experiment data .",
    "thanks to the efforts of the b factories and lhc , the exploration of quark - flavor mixing is now entering a new interesting era . measurements of rare b mesons decays such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath3 are likely to provide sensitive test of the sm .",
    "in fact , these decays , induced by the flavor changing neutral currents which occur in the sm only at loop level , play an important role in testing higher order effects of sm and in searching for the physics beyond the sm @xcite . nevertheless , these processes are also important in determining the parameters of the sm and some hadronic parameters in qcd , such as the ckm matrix elements , the meson decay constant @xmath8 , providing information on heavy meson wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the rare b inclusive radiative decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as the exclusive decays @xmath7 have been studied extremely at the leading logarithm order  @xcite and high order in the sm  @xcite and various new physics models . in previous works ,",
    "prediction for the exclusive decays @xmath9 have been carried out by using the light cone sum rule  @xcite , the simple constituent quark model  @xcite , and the b meson distribution amplitude extracted from non - leptonic b decays  @xcite .",
    "long distance qcd effects describing the neutral vector - meson resonances @xmath10 and @xmath11 family have received special attention in @xcite . at parton level ,",
    "@xmath9 decays have been thought to be obtained from decay @xmath12 , and further , from @xmath13 directly . to achieve this ,",
    "a necessary work is attaching real photon to any charged internal and external lines in the feynman diagrams of @xmath13 with two statements : i ) contributions from the attachment of photon to any charged internal propagator are regraded as to be strongly suppressed and can be neglected safely   @xcite ; ii ) contributions from the attachment of real photon with magnetic - penguin vertex to any charged external lines are always neglected  @xcite or stated to be negligibly small  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to address that the conclusion of the first statement is correct , but the explanation is not as what it is described  @xcite .",
    "the second statement seems to be questionable , for that the pole of propagator of the charged line attached by photon may enhance the decay rate greatly which make some diagrams can not be neglected in the calculation .",
    "since the weak radiative b - meson decay is well known to be a sensitive probe of new physics , it is essential to calculate the standard model value of its branching ratio as precisely as possible . although the second contribution has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it mainly concentrated on the long distance effects of the meson resonances , whereas the short distance contribution which was incompletely analyzed .    in this letter",
    ", we will concentrate on the short distance contribution to @xmath3 and check whether the contribution from magnetic - penguin operator with _",
    "real _ photon to @xmath14 is negligible or not , and give some remarks including a comparison with other works .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hami ] , we present the detailed calculation of exclusive decays @xmath9 , including full contribution from magnetic - penguin operator with real photon .",

    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "in order to simplify the decay amplitude for @xmath3 , we have to utilize the @xmath0 meson wave function , which is not known from the first principal .",
    "fortunately , many studies on non - leptonic @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath0 decays @xcite have constrained the wave function strictly .",
    "it was found that the wave function has form @xmath16 where the distribution amplitude @xmath17 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the momentum fractions shared by @xmath20 quark in @xmath0 meson .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath21 can be determined by comparing @xmath22dx = -4ip_{b_s}^{\\mu}\\int_{0}^{1}\\phi_{b_s}(x)dx\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 the @xmath15 meson decay constant @xmath8 is thus determined by the condition @xmath24    let us start with the quark level processes @xmath13 .",
    "they are subject to the qcd corrected effective weak hamiltonian , obtained by integrating out heavy particles , i.e. , top quark , higgs , and @xmath25 bosons : @xmath26\\bar{\\ell}\\gamma_\\mu{\\ell}\\right.\\nn\\\\ & & \\left.+c_{10}(\\bar{s}\\gamma^\\mu{p_l}b)~ \\bar{\\ell}\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5{\\ell}\\right\\ } , \\label{hami}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 ,  @xmath28 is the dilepton invariant mass squared .",
    "the qcd corrected wilson coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 scale can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if an additional photon line is attached to any of the charged lines in diagrams contributing to the hamiltonian above , we will have the radiative leptonic decays @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , there are two kinds of diagrams : photon connecting to the internal propagators , and photon connecting to the external line .",
    "as addressed in the introduction , the contribution from the first kind of diagrams is neglected safely .",
    "now we will only consider the second category of diagrams which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "at first , we recalculate the diagrams ( a)-(d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with photon emitted from the external quark lines @xmath34 or @xmath20 by using the @xmath0 meson wave function extracted from non - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "note that these diagrams are already studied in previous literatures and considered as giving the dominant contribution to @xmath3 . at parton level , the amplitudes for transition @xmath12 can be calculated directly using from the hamiltonian of @xmath13 in ( [ hami ] ) . for example , contribution from the magnetic - penguin operator with _ virtual _ photon shown in fig .",

    "( [ ampp ] ) are found to be : @xmath44 where @xmath45 the expression in ( [ ampp ] ) can be compared with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we will focus attention on calculating the diagrams ( e ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which are always neglected in other works . in these two diagrams ,",
    "photon of the magnetic - penguin operator is _ real _ , thus its contribution to @xmath3 is different from that of magnetic - penguin operator with virtual photon in diagram ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "we get the amplitude : @xmath46 \\left[\\bar{\\ell}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\ell\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath47 obtained by a replacement : @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "note that pole in @xmath47 corresponds to the pole of the quark propagator when it is connected by the off - shell photon propagator .",

    "the total matrix element for the decay @xmath9 is obtained a sum of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 . after summing over the spins of leptons and polarization of the photon , and then performing the phase space integration over one of the two dalitz variables",

    "the decay branching ratios can be easily obtained by integrating over photon energy . in numerical calculations , we use the following parameters  @xcite : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 the ratios of @xmath3 with and without the contribution from magnetic - penguin operator with real photon are shown in table [ table ] together with results of @xmath64 from this work and other models for comparison .",
    "the errors shown in the table  [ table ] comes from the heavy meson wave function , by varying the parameter @xmath65 , and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "note that , the predicted branching ratios receive errors from many parameters , such as meson decay constant , meson and quark masses etc .",
    ".comparison of branching ratios with other model calculations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    a couple of remarks on the @xmath0 rare exclusive radiative decays are follows :    * as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the branching ratios are proportional to the heavy meson wave function squared , the radiative leptonic decays are very sensitive probes in extracting the heavy meson wave functions ; * the contributions from magnetic - penguin operator with real photon to the exclusive decay is large , and the branching of @xmath3 is enhanced nearly by a factor 2 compared with that only contribution from magnetic - penguin operator with virtual photon and nearly up to @xmath4 , implying the search of @xmath3 can be achieved in near future . * due to the large contributions from magnetic - penguin operator with real photon , the form factors for matrix elements @xmath67 and @xmath68 as a function of dilepton mass squared @xmath28 are not as simple as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is constant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 transition form factors predicted in this works have also some differences from those in ref .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite predicted the form factors @xmath72 , @xmath73 induced by tensor and pseudotensor currents with emission of the virtual photon , as shown in diagrams ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are only equal at maximum photon energy , whereas the corresponding formula in this work have the same expression as @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ ampp ] ) .",
    "the research of @xmath3 may give some hints on these form factors .    at this stage , we think it is necessary to present a few more comments about the calculation of ref . @xcite . in order to estimate the contribution of emission of the real photon from the magnetic - penguin operator , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the form factors @xmath75 by including the short distance contribution in @xmath76 limit and additional long distance contribution from the resonances of vector mesons such as @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 decay and @xmath10 for @xmath0 decay .",
    "obviously , this means the pole mass enhancement of the valence quark were not appropriately taken into account .",
    "moreover , if @xmath80 stands for the short distance contribution , it seems double counting since in this case photons which emits from magnetic - penguin vertex and quark lines directly are not able to be distinguished .",
    "we evaluated the rare decays @xmath81 in the sm , including two kinds of contributions from magnetic - penguin operator with virtual and real photon .",
    "in contrast to the previous works which treated contribution from magnetic - penguins operators with real photon to the decays as negligible small , we found that the contributions is large , leading to the branching of @xmath3 being nearly enhanced by a factor 2 . in the current early phase of the lhc era ,",
    "the exclusive modes with muons in the final states are among the most promising decays .",
    "the decay @xmath7 is likely to be confirmed before the end of 2012 @xcite .",
    "although there are some theoretical challenges in calculation of the hadronic form factors and non - factorable corrections , with the predicted branching ratios at order of @xmath4 , @xmath9 can be expected as the next goal once @xmath7 measurement is finished since the final states can be identified easily and branching ratios are large . our predictions for such processes can be tested in the lhc - b and b factories in near future .",
