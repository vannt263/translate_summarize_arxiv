    "geometrical and topological concepts and tools are important in many branches of natural sciences , namely in physics .",
    "for instance , the idea of symmetry , intimately associated to geometry , is a keystone for studying a number of fundamental properties of several physical systems , e.g. , noether theorem asserts a conserved quantity to each continuous symmetry of the associated action .",
    "topology , in turn , is crucial for classifying and for giving stability to certain excitations , like solitons ( extending objects having finite energy ) and vortices ( presenting non - vanishing vorticity around a given singular point or a topological obstruction ) .",
    "these and others have been observed in a number of systems , like superconductors , superfluids , and magnetic materials , namely vortex - like magnetization has been directly observed in nanomagnets @xcite . on the other hand , the observed vortex - pair dissociation is the mechanism behind the topological phase transition@xcite .",
    "another kind of topological objects emerges from euclidian non - abelian pure - field models in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "they are called instantons , since they represent points in the euclidian space - time . in this case",
    ", the relevant homotopy group is that associated to the mapping of the field space to the 4-dimensional euclidian one , so that @xmath7 , for example , if the internal space is the qcd gauge group , @xmath8 .",
    "such excitations play important role in this framework once the nonconservation of the flavor singlet axial current is proportional to the instanton charge @xcite .",
    "+ in turn , the toroidal geometry has recently received a considerable attention , for example , as tight traps for bose - einstein condensates , inside which the atoms develop quasi - one - dimensional confined dynamics subject to periodic boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "ring - shaped carbon nanotubes have been shown to provide quasi - zero - dimensional systems , whenever the rings are very small@xcite .",
    "in addition , their topology also make them possible field - effect transistors for technological applications@xcite , as well as , the suitable control of their stable magnetization ( e.g. , those with vortex - like profile ) may be useful for applications in magneto - electronic devices , namely if an array of magnetic nanorings is concerned @xcite . from a more fundamental point of view , it has been verified that whenever the ising model is defined on a donut - shaped lattice , then instead of an unique , there appear two critical temperatures@xcite . even in biology ,",
    "the toroidal shape plays important roles : for instance , it has been observed that a large number of proteins involved in dna metabolism adopts a ring - like shape , even though these proteins have quite distinct and unrelated functions in this mechanism .",
    "why this geometry / topology is so abundant in this process and the reason why life evolution has selected it amongst many others remains a puzzle in the specialized literature @xcite .",
    "+ geometrically , a torus of genus-1 ( one central hole ) is a compact surface whose ( gaussian ) curvature smoothly varies from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , along its polar angle ( see details below ) , so interpolating between the pseudospherical and spherical curvatures whenever @xmath4 . from the topological point of view , the simplest genus-1 torus is obtained by the topological product of two circles , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "[ in general , a genus - n torus is got in a similar way , for example , that of genus-2 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "this confers it a non - simply connectivity , say , closed loops holding on its central hole or the polar circumference can not be shrunk to a point ( other non - simply connected topologies are the ordinary circle and a disk with a hole , an annulus ) . + for studying classical spin - like textures , of solitonic and vortex kinds , on a torus , we first write down the continuum version of the heisenberg ( exchange ) hamiltonian in this geometry ( section 2 ) .",
    "later , the non - linear euler - lagrange equations are obtained and some particular cases are explicitly considered for describing the desired excitations .",
    "in addition , their profiles , energies and other basic properties are discussed and compared to their counterparts from other surfaces .",
    "these tasks are performed in section 3 , where solitonic - like solutions in the isotropic regime are described and , in section 4 , which is dedicated to vortex - like configurations , studied within the planar rotator model ( equivalently , the xy model , once are dealing only with static properties ) . finally , we close our paper by pointing out our conclusions and prospects for forthcoming investigation .",
    "the anisotropic exchange heisenberg model , for nearest - neighbor interacting spins on a two - dimensional lattice , is given by the hamiltonian below : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the coupling between neighboring spins , and according to @xmath15 or @xmath16 , the hamiltonian describes a ferro or anti ferromagnetic system , respectively .",

    "the simplest way to seek for possible solitonic solutions associated to the present model on a torus is considering the isotropic regime , @xmath21 , and writing down the hamiltonian ( [ htoro ] ) , and its associated equations ( [ th],[ph ] ) , in a more suitable coordinate system which allows us of getting the sine - gordon equation in a simpler way ( further details may be found in refs.@xcite ) .",

    "however , for finite @xmath1 , such a mapping is incomplete and no homotopy arguments can be used for classifying solution ( [ solitontoro ] ) as a topological excitation . indeed ,",
    "in this case , we must take into account the topology of the geometrical support : although the genus prevents the complete mapping from the spin sphere onto the torus ( so that the solution presents a fractional charge , @xmath103 ) , at the same time it also ensures topological stability , at principle , preventing the fractional soliton from decaying against the ground - state . in other words , now the soliton acquires a finite characteristic length , proportional to the genus size , which prevents its collapse and consequently its size from vanishing .",

    "equation above gets the simple form : @xmath117 that is easily solved by : @xmath118 which is precisely the simplest solution we have for the spherical geometry @xcite , whose energy reads @xmath119 , corresponding to the fundamental solitons with charges @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we have seen that solitonic solutions lying on a torus generally present ( or are expected to ) fractional charges .",
    "these charges equal unity only at specific limits : for @xmath2 we effectively get a soliton on an infinite cylinder , while for @xmath56 the spherical counterpart is obtained .",
    "geometrically , a vortex with a net winding number @xmath121 , may be viewed as a set of spins rotating in a closed circuit around a core ( whose center is a singular point ) or a topological obstruction , making impossible to change the configuration to a perfectly aligned state without tampering with spins at an arbitrary distance from the core .",
    "thus , once a vortex - like configuration can not be continuously deformed to the ground - state , it acquire the status of a topologically stable excitation .",
    "vortices have been intensively studied for decades in a number of physical systems , like superfluids and superconductors , and they have been recently observed in several nanomagnets as remanent states of the net magnetization @xcite .",
    "in addition , they have been proposed to take part ( and even to be the key elements ) in some magnetoelectronic mechanisms with potential applications to magnetic recording , processing , sensors , and so forth @xcite .",
    "+ when we model a vortex as a continuum of spins we intend to describe only its outer region , once inside the core the analytical treatment is expected to give only an estimate of its energy , shedding no light about its real structure and spins arrangement , which require numeric / simulation techniques . however , as we shall see , in the toroidal topology , a natural cutoff for the vortex is provided by the genus whenever @xmath122 , so that , in a ring torus the solution presents no core . on the other hand , in the case of a horn torus ( @xmath5 )",
    "a singular core takes place , while for @xmath6 ( spindle torus ) two singular points are verified . in both cases ,",
    "the cores appear at the self - intercepting points ( discussed earlier , see fig .",
    "[ horn - and - spindle ] and related text ) .",
    "+ to achieve our purposes we shall consider the planar rotator model , whose continuum hamiltonian may be obtained from ( [ htoro ] ) with @xmath23 and @xmath123 ( once we are dealing with static solutions , our results apply equally well to the xy model ) , so that : @xmath124d\\phi d\\theta\\,.\\ ] ] demanding @xmath64 to be cylindrically symmetric , @xmath112 , hamiltonian above yields the following : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the charge of the vortex while @xmath127 is a constant accounting for its global profile , giving no contribution to its exchange energy . the charge ( vorticity )",
    "is formally defined , in the continuum limit , as : @xmath128 where the integration is evaluated along a closed path , c , around the genus of the torus .",
    "taking the solution above to the hamiltonian ( [ hprm ] ) , we obtain , for a ring torus @xmath129 :    @xmath130    from what we see that , distinctly from other cases ( planar , conical , spherical or pseudospherical geometries ) , the energy of a vortex in a ring torus does not present singularities , so that no cutoff needs to be introduced to prevent spurious divergences .",
    "the profile of a vortex with @xmath131 and @xmath132 is presented in fig .",
    "[ vorticetoro ] .",
    "note that its energy increases with @xmath0 and decreases as @xmath1 is raised .",
    "in addition , note that as @xmath2 then @xmath133 vanishes , what is expected since at this limit we effectively deal with the spins lying along the axial direction of an infinite cylinder , so being parallel to each other ( in the ferromagnetic case ) .",
    "thus , instead of a true vortex we have the ground - state configuration in this flat geometry , whose normalized energy vanishes . +     on the ring torus .",

    "the genus holds as a natural cutoff , preventing any core formation where energy could spuriously diverge.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    similar analysis may be suitably employed to the remaining supports .",
    "however , in the case of a horn torus ( @xmath135 ) , hamiltonian ( [ hprm ] ) diverges for the vortex solution ( [ solvortex ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since for this case the genus of the torus has been shrunk to a point ( but it is not absent ) where a singular core may be developed .",
    "now , this spurious divergence must be bypassed by introducing a cutoff around the vortex core size , @xmath136 . doing that , the vortex energy on a horn torus may be easily evaluated to give : @xmath137 which depends only upon the relative sizes of the core to the vortex , @xmath138 .",
    "the singular core appears exactly where the horn torus is self - intercepting .",
    "this will also happen to the spindle torus , where a pair of singularities takes place , once this surface crosses itself at two distinct points ( in variable @xmath109 ) , like follows .",
    "+ if we insist in configurations like @xmath112 , we clearly realize that the energy density diverges at those two points where the spindle torus is self - intercepting , say , @xmath139 . integrating hamiltonian ( [ hprm ] ) with solution ( [ solvortex ] ) , but keeping @xmath109 arbitrary , gives : @xmath140 for extracting some finite and meaningful quantity we must evaluate the result above over proper intervals . for",
    "that we should introduce suitable cutoffs around those points where energy density given by ( [ hprm ] ) blows up , say , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and only later we should evaluate @xmath143 suitably in order to bypass the singularities .",
    "however , this task is very tedious and results in a very length expression , which will be omitted here .",
    "the main feature is that the well - defined vortex energy clearly shows the appearance of two singular cores located at both @xmath144 , given above .",
    "another interesting issue is that whenever @xmath56 , then integration of hamiltonian ( [ hprm ] ) for solution ( [ solvortex ] ) gives us exactly that result obtained in the spherical case@xcite , namely , exhibiting the pair of cores at antipodal points . in summary , if we start off by a ring torus ( @xmath4 ) where the vortex is coreless and decrease @xmath1 , we eventually get a horn torus , where a core is formed . decreasing @xmath1",
    "further a spindle torus is obtained and the vortex now presents a pair of singular cores , at the self - intercepting points . at the limit @xmath56 these cores are located at diametrically opposite positions and , effectively we have a vortex lying on a sphere of radius @xmath0 . + as previously discussed for the solitonic case , we could look for ` vortex - like ' solutions depending on the polar angle , say , @xmath145 . for this case ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hprm ] ) yields : @xmath146 while the topological charge is given by @xmath147 ( so , valid only for the ring torus ) .",
    "therefore , the solution of equation above may be written as : @xmath148 whose energy is easily evaluated and gives : @xmath149 which blows up as the ring torus becomes infinite , @xmath150 .",
    "we have studied the heisenberg exchange model for classical spins defined on a toroidal geometry / topology .",
    "solitonic and vortex - type configurations were described in some details , including their energy , profile and behavior at some limiting cases of the torus size and geometry .",
    "+ we first considered the isotropic regime . there , only for the ring torus ( @xmath4 )",
    "solitonic solutions were analytically obtained .",
    "these solutions appear to bear fractional charges while their stability could be ensured , at principle , by the non - trivial topology of this torus , provided by the finite size of its central hole , @xmath122 . as @xmath1 increases such a charge",
    "is raised but equals the unity only for @xmath2 ( in practice , a soliton in an infinite cylinder ) . on the other hand , as @xmath56 a soliton lying on a sphere is described .",

    "+ an interesting problem to be investigated is a small nanoring , say , with the geometry and topology of a ring torus .",
