    "the physics of exotic nuclei still keeps motivating several research initiatives worldwide .",
    "dedicated ongoing and future experiments promise to deliver more intense beams of rare isotopes along with new sophisticated detection techniques , paving the way to explore the limits of existence of several unknown nuclear systems and their unusual properties .",
    "halo nuclei and nucleon - alpha clusters are particular examples of exotic nuclei and constitute the focus of this talk .",
    "they are normally characterized by a large structure relative to the typical size of each of its components , nucleons and/or stable nuclei .",
    "the large - distance physics of those systems is a response to the shallowness of their separation binding energies , @xmath0 mev . to them",
    "is associated a low - momentum scale @xmath1 which contrasts with a high - momentum @xmath2 set by the energy required to excite a core , usually of the order of a few mev .",
    "this separation of scales matches quite well with the ideas of effective field theories ( efts ) , where the ratio of scales sets an expansion parameter that provides systematic and model - independent predictions , as well as more rigorous control over theoretical uncertainties .",
    "halo / cluster eft has been developed to account for certain aspects of loosely bound nuclear clusters , namely , low - energy resonances and coulomb interactions . in the following",
    "i explain how these features are handled , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems as examples .",
    "the power counting for low - energy narrow resonances was developed in @xcite . unlike shallow bound states",
    ", a higher amount of fine - tuning is required to produce the expected energy dependence of the amplitude .",
    "that means a non - static two - body propagator or , equivalently , the sum of effective range contributions to all orders . as an example",
    "let us start with the @xmath3 interaction , whose strong part is described by the following lagrangian @xmath5\\phi -\\,d^{\\dagger}\\bigg[i\\partial_0+\\frac{\\vec\\nabla^2}{4m_{\\alpha}}-\\delta\\bigg]d % \\nonumber\\\\ & & % + g\\,\\big[d^{\\dagger}\\phi\\phi+(\\phi\\phi)^{\\dagger}d\\big ] + \\cdots\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : lolag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduce an auxiliary ( dimer ) field @xmath6 with `` residual mass '' @xmath7 , carrying the quantum numbers of two alphas in @xmath8-wave and coupling with their fields via the coupling constant @xmath9 . for a non - static @xmath6 propagator",
    "@xmath7 has to scale as the kinetic energy , @xmath10 , already two orders away from the natural scaling @xmath11 .",
    "the dots stand for higher order terms in a derivative expansion .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are introduced via minimal substitution , with coulomb forces being the dominant ones  @xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld parameter @xmath12 sets the magnitude of coulomb interactions , where @xmath13 is the inverse of the @xmath14 bohr radius .",
    "the fact that @xmath13 is numerically of @xmath15 requires the sum of coulomb photons to all orders .",
    "the technique to handle this problem was given by kong and ravndal , using established ideas of coulomb green s function and two - potential scattering  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - distorted strong amplitude acquires the form of a coulomb - modified effective range expansion , with the shape parameter term treated as a perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 system is remarkable for having a scattering length of the order of 2000 fm , while the effective range and shape parameter obey natural dimensional analysis , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath3 resonance energy of @xmath18 kev sets the low - momentum scale to @xmath19 mev , well below the high - momentum scale set by the pion mass or the excitation energy of the alpha particle , @xmath20 mev . with an expansion parameter around 1/7 ,",
    "the strong scattering length @xmath21 can at most be of the order of few hundreds of mev .",
    "we found in our study  @xcite that most of the remaining scaling factor comes from a detailed cancellation between strong and electromagnetic interactions , an incredible amount of fine tuning .",
    "this is the outcome of an exponentially suppressed resonance width due to a large coulomb barrier , entangled with the location of the resonance very close to the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "this fine tuning was not expected and is not well understood , but leads to some interesting scenarios .",
    "first , an increase on the strong force by a few percent is enough to produce a bound @xmath22 , which could have drastic astrophysical consequences .",
    "second , the already large fine tuning in the strong parameters lead to an unitary amplitude at leading order ( lo ) when coulomb is turned off .",
    "the @xmath22 would then be a bound state at zero energy , and the system with three @xmath23 s would exhibit an exact efimov spectrum  @xcite .",
    "although coulomb forces are highly non - perturbative , the fact that both @xmath22 and the hoyle state ( a @xmath24 excited state @xmath25 kev above the @xmath26 threshold ) remains very close to threshold supports such picture close to the unitary limit .",
    "the hoyle state is essential to describe the correct abundance of @xmath24 in the universe .",
    "its existence is usually given as an example of large fine tuning in the parameters of the underlying theory  @xcite , but how that relates to the fine tuning in the @xmath3 system is almost an unexplored subject .",
    "our study provides a humble step to address this issue .      despite this puzzling fine tuning",
    ", the associated power counting seems to be the correct one to describe the scattering data . at lo",
    "we have no free parameters , since we use the latest measurements of the resonance position and width  @xcite as input . at nlo",
    ", the extra parameter is fitted to the @xmath3 phase shifts .",
    "the large cancellation between strong and electromagnetic forces allows us to extract the effective range parameters with an accuracy better than previous determinations  @xcite .",
    "the eft approach to @xmath4 scattering follows steps similar to the @xmath3 case  @xcite .",
    "however , in this situation the envelope of the resonance is mainly given by the angular momentum barrier  coulomb forces provide just a correction to the strong part . at",
    "lo the amplitude receives contributions of both the @xmath40 and @xmath41 except around the @xmath41 resonance , which is enhanced . at nlo the @xmath40 effective range and @xmath41 shape",
    "parameter enter as perturbations .",
    "the @xmath42 partial wave contributes only at higher orders  @xcite .",
