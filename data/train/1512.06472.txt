    "gravitational collapse is one of the most intriguing phenomena in the theory of gravity . in the past two decades",
    ", a lot of interesting phenomenologies have been found at the threshold of the black hole formation in gravitational collapse models .",
    "the first discovery of the behavior of the gravitational collapse was found by choptuik @xcite who studied the self - gravitating dynamics of massless scalar field in a spherically symmetric background .",
    "although this is the first and simplest realistic model of the gravitational collapse , it contains most of the features associated with critical collapse .",
    "there exists a one - parameter family of initial data in the collapse of the spherically symmetric massless scalar field ; if the parameter value @xmath0 is over the critical value @xmath1 , a black hole will be formed ; however if @xmath2 , the scalar field eventually dissipates away .",
    "the black hole mass has been found with a power - law scaling , @xmath3 , where the critical exponent @xmath4 is observed to be universal . for more general discussions and understandings of the gravitational collapse",
    ", please refer to review articles @xcite and references therein .",
    "the physical reason behind the gravitational collapse is the nature of competition in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the imploding scalar field wants to disperse the field to infinity , however the gravitational potential energy , if it is sufficiently dominant during the collapse , will trap some amount of energy of the system to form a black hole .",
    "the interesting key point is that the dynamical competition can be controlled by tuning a parameter in the initial conditions .",
    "if @xmath0 in the one - parameter family of initial data is less than some critical value @xmath1 , the scalar field will completely run away .",
    "but if @xmath5 , a black hole can be developed .    besides the internal factors in the initial conditions of perturbations , for example the initial field amplitude etc , which control the dynamics of the gravitational collapse , it is interesting to ask whether some external factors can influence the perturbations , affect the imploding of the scalar field and finally control the gravitational collapse",
    "one of the external factors we can think about is the cosmological constant .",
    "most of the critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse were studied in the asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "it is of interest to investigate how the spacetimes with cosmological constant influence the gravitational collapse . recently in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) background with negative cosmological constant , the gravitational collapse was examined in the spherically symmetric configuration .",
    "it was argued that in the einstein gravity the ads space is unstable and the ads black hole can be formed under arbitrarily small generic perturbations @xcite . this instability is due to the subtle interplay of local nonlinear dynamics and the nonlocal kinematical effect of the ads reflecting boundary .",
    "it was further claimed that the results of the ads collapse of a scalar field exist as well in other dimensions @xcite .",
    "this clarified the argument in @xcite that for dimensions higher than four there is no black hole formation in ads due to the small initial perturbation of the scalar field . considering the dependence of the instability and turbulent behavior on the local dynamics ,",
    "recently the stability of ads spacetime has been examined further in the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite .",
    "it was found that with the gauss - bonnet factor , the ads black hole can not be formed dynamically if the total mass / energy content of the spacetime is too small . in the ads spacetime ,",
    "the collapse of self - interacting scalar field was examined in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapses in the de sitter spacetime with an addition of a positive cosmological constant have also been studied . in @xcite , it was claimed that the positive cosmological constant lead to a dissipation of the critical solution . in this work",
    ", we will examine this effect more carefully in the gravitational collapse in different dimensional de sitter spacetimes .",
    "another study of the gravitational collapse in the de sitter spacetime was done in @xcite , where the attention was on discussing whether the gravitational collapse disturbs the ds / cft correspondence .",
    "another external factor that can influence the gravitational collapse in the spherically symmetric spacetime is the electric charge . including the electric charge",
    ", we will have one more repulsive force to join the competition in dynamics .",
    "intuitively this external factor will hinder the gravitational collapse so that we need a stronger amplitude in the initial perturbation to develop a black hole .",
    "a simple model for describing the charged matter collapse is to consider a complex scalar field coupled to electromagnetism .",
    "in @xcite , the influence of the charge conjugation on the formation of a charged black hole was studied .",
    "surprisingly it was observed that with the external factor ( i.e. the charge conjugation ) , the black hole can be formed even in the former subcritical region . for the supercritical initial condition with stronger initial perturbation , the formed black hole can have larger mass due to the charge conjugation .",
    "it was explained that although the charge opposes gravitation , the electromagnetic energy density also contributes to the gravitational binding and by doing so the formation of a black hole becomes easier due to this external factor .",
    "this result was confirmed in the study of the scalar electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore the authors also obtained the universal power - law scaling of the black hole charge .",
    "some related works about charged scalar collapse in several setups can be found in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we further examine the effect of the electric charge and try to answer the question of whether the black hole charge is always a perturbation and does not play a role in the competition of dynamics in the process of collapse .",
    "we will concentrate more on the evolution of the charged scalar perturbation and examine how the process of the gravitational collapse of the charged scalar field and the time scale of the black hole formation can be affected by initial conditions and the electric charge .    in the study of the stability of the reissner - nordstrom - ds black holes",
    ", it was found that the black hole is gravitationally unstable for large values of the electric charge and cosmological constant when the spacetime dimension @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained by numerical study on the quasinormal modes in the linear perturbation level @xcite and later the instability was confirmed analytically @xcite .",
    "however deep physical reasons behind this phenomenon are still lacking .",
    "this result leads us to raise the question of whether the behaviors of the gravitational collapse of charged scalar field in de sitter background are different in different spacetime dimensions . in asymptotically flat spacetime background ,",
    "scalar field collapses in higher dimensional spacetime were found similar to four dimensions @xcite",
    ". here we will examine whether the external factors , the cosmological constant and the electric charge can modify the result . instead of the linear perturbation",
    ", our investigation will disclose the nature and consequences of nonlinearity in general relativity .",
    "in our analysis we will concentrate on spacetime dimension @xmath7 , which reflects the special property in the stability of the highly charged de sitter black hole , and later we will compare the result obtained in @xmath7 with other spacetime dimensions for the gravitational collapse of the charged scalar field in the de sitter background .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will derive the evolution equations in spherically symmetric ds spacetime . in section 3",
    ", we will describe the numerical method and introduce the initial conditions for the evolution of perturbations . in section 4",
    "we will show numerical results .",
    "the conclusion will be provided in the last section .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric charged scalar field @xmath8 , which is complex in combination of two real scalar fields @xmath9 in the form @xmath10 .",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor is defined as @xmath11}$ ] .",
    "the total lagrangian of the scalar field and the electromagnetic field is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic field . here",
    "@xmath14 is the complex conjugate of @xmath8 .",
    "varying @xmath15 with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath16 respectively , one gets the equation of motion of scalar field @xmath17 and the equation of motion of the electromagnetic field @xmath18    the conserved current is described by @xmath19,\\ ] ] which satisfies @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding charge can be obtained from the integration @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normal vector of spacelike hypersurface , @xmath4 the determinant of the induced metric and @xmath23 the total charge surrounded by this hypersurface .",
    "the einstein equation reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cosmological constant which is positive in the de sitter spacetime and the energy - momentum tensor is described by @xmath26    we restrict to the spherically symmetric spacetime with the metric @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the line element of the unit @xmath29-dimensional sphere .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath30 measures the proper surface area .",
    "the normal vector of the spacelike hypersurface @xmath31 then is @xmath32 . in the spherically symmetric spacetime",
    ", the gauge field can be written as @xmath33 we take the axial gauge and set further @xmath34 , the only non - vanishing electromagnetic field is then @xmath35 .    introducing auxiliary variables of the scalar field",
    "@xmath36 the scalar equation ( [ eq : scalareq ] ) turns into @xmath37    introducing an auxiliary variable for the gauge field @xmath38 we have the evolution equation of the electromagnetic field ( [ eq : maxwelleq ] ) in the form @xmath39    the constraint equation between the scalar and the electromagnetic fields has the form @xmath40    the nontrivial einstein equations expressed in terms of auxiliary variables are @xmath41 furthermore , there is also a momentum constraint requirement @xmath42    in the spherically symmetric spacetime , the conserved charge ( [ eq : charge ] ) can be expressed into @xmath43 in which we have used the volume of @xmath29-dimensional sphere @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to see that besides the charge conjugation @xmath13 between the scalar field and the electromagnetic field , the amplitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 also influence the value of the charge . in @xcite ,",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 were fixed to be the same and only the influence of the value of the charge conjugation q on the perturbation and the gravitational collapse was discussed . in the following we will confirm the result obtained in @xcite that the charge conjugation effect on the electric charge can always be treated perturbatively at the black hole threshold .",
    "furthermore we will disclose more properties of the electric charge on the gravitational collapse provided that we set free the amplitudes of initial perturbations .",
    "moreover we define the mass aspect function @xmath47 in analogy with the usual reissner - nordstrom  ds form of the static spherically symmetric metric @xmath48,\\label{eq : mass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the gravitational potential is in the form @xmath49 .",
    "to solve the evolution equations , we need to specify initial conditions .",
    "since the equations of motion of charged scalar field ( 11 ) are complex second - order differential equations , four initial profiles are needed to be specified .",
    "we take the following initial profiles : @xmath50 where the initial amplitudes are taken differently . given initial conditions ( [ eq : initial2 ] ) , the auxiliary electromagnetic field @xmath51 can be determined from ( [ eq : maxwellconstraint ] ) and the initial metric coefficients can be calculated from ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . then with the help of ( [ eq : e2 ] ) , we can derive the initial gauge field @xmath52 . until this moment",
    "the initial conditions can totally be determined .",
    "furthermore from ( [ eq : scalar2timeder ] ) , we know how the charged scalar field evolves , then from ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) we can learn how the electromagnetic field evolves , and using ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) we know how the metric coefficients change . later with ( [ eq : e2 ] ) and ( [ eq : auxiliaryfield ] ) we know how the gauge field and scalar field develop . repeating this procedure ,",
    "we can obtain the evolution of the charged scalar field and examine whether the perturbation can lead to the instability in the spherically symmetric ds spacetime .",
    "there are two constraint equations ( [ eq : maxwellconstraint ] ) and ( [ eq : momentum - constr ] ) which we have not used , but they are important to check the accuracy of the numerical computations .    besides the initial conditions , we also need to specify the boundary conditions in the numerical computations .",
    "the regularity of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) at center @xmath53 requires that @xmath54 .",
    "we solve the constraints by integrating outwards and take the boundary condition @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the time coordinate at the center @xmath53 is chosen as the proper time .",
    "the remaining gauge allows us to take @xmath56 .",
    "we solve the system of equations numerically using a fourth - order runge - kutta method in both time and space directions .",
    "the adjustable time step @xmath57 is kept @xmath58 for the constant spatial grid spacing @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the cosmological horizon developed in the existence of the scalar field and the electromagnetic field , which is determined by the largest root of @xmath61 .",
    "this scheme allows for stable long - time evolution . to overcome the error caused by @xmath62 in the evolution equations near @xmath53",
    ", we expand the variables around the center . smoothness at the origin then implies that we have following power series expansions near @xmath53 : @xmath63 these expansions allow us to express values of functions near the boundary @xmath53 with their values inside the domain .",
    "for example if function @xmath64 has the expansion near @xmath53 : @xmath65 we get the folllowing equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spatial grid spacing which is very small . then we can express @xmath68 in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 similarly , we can also write @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 . in this way , the numerical error caused by @xmath62 term is suppressed . besides , de lhopital rule @xmath74 is applied at @xmath53 if @xmath75 as @xmath76 . the instability of @xmath77 near @xmath53 is suppressed by the factor @xmath30 comparing to the leading term @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the kreiss - oliger dissipation which is crucial to stabilize the solutions is employed @xcite .    in our numerical calculations , the criteria for the formation of a black hole",
    "is set as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the apparent horizon of the black hole .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath81 unless otherwise specified , where @xmath82 is the spacetime dimension , so the cosmological horizon of a pure de sitter spacetime locates at @xmath83 . in all numerical calculations ,",
    "we take initial conditions ( [ eq : initial2 ] ) and choose @xmath84 .",
    "the centers of the initial pulses are @xmath85 , the widths @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "we first present a qualitative picture on how gravitational collapse in de sitter spacetime can happen .",
    "we plot the evolution of the gravitational potential in fig.([fig : potential_1 ] ) . on the left panel ,",
    "we present the evolution of the gravitational potential when the initial amplitude of the perturbation is below the critical value , where we observe that the potential barrier arises at first and then disappears after certain period of time evolution .",
    "no high enough gravitational potential can grow to trap the perturbation and the scalar field finally escapes out of the cosmological horizon . on the right panel , we exhibit the situation when the perturbation field starts with strong initial amplitude and a very high potential barrier can be developed near the center in the evolution so that a big part of the scalar field can be trapped and the black hole can be formed .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting to show that the phenomenon we discovered is not specific to the initial conditions ( [ eq : initial2 ] ) , we have also checked other initial conditions , for example @xmath88 and also for other forms of spherically symmetric initial conditions .",
    "we find the similar behavior as shown in figure 3 .",
    "so the phenomenon we discovered above is not specific to the initial conditions ( [ eq : initial2 ] ) .",
    "it holds for a rather general class of initial perturbations .",
    "the above results are for the seven - dimensional de sitter spacetime . considering that in the study of the linear perturbation of the highly charged de sitter black hole , it was found that the instability appears when the spacetime dimension is bigger than seven while disappears for lower dimensional configurations @xcite , we have the motivation to check whether the gravitational collapse of the charged scalar field in de sitter spacetime can also exhibit special property in different dimensions .",
    "for this reason , we have generalized the above calculations to other dimensions from @xmath89 to @xmath90 with cosmological constant in the form @xmath81 .",
    "we found from numerical computations , the qualitative behaviors of the collapse of the charged scalar field in other dimensions are similar to those reported above in seven dimensions .",
    "the universality of the gravitational collapse in charged scalar field in different dimensional de sitter spacetimes is consistent with the study of the collapse of neutral scalar field in the same de sitter space - time . combining with the results obtained here and in @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that the dimension of the space - time can not change the qualitative property in the nonlinear results in the gravitational collapse .",
    "we have studied the charged scalar collapse in the spherically symmetric de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the de sitter space - time with positive cosmological constant is different from the asymptotically flat space - time since the positive cosmological constant contributes a dissipation effect against the imploding of the perturbation .",
    "this is the reason that with the cosmological constant , the process of the gravitational collapse is hindered and it requires bigger critical threshold for the formation of a black hole .",
    "we have shown that this property is universal in higher dimensions .    besides the cosmological constant ,",
    "we have also examined another external factor , the electric charge , to influence the gravitational collapse .",
    "dynamically with the addition of the electric charge , there are three competitors competing in the process of the gravitational collapse : gravity traps the scalar field , kinetic energy and electromagnetic force disperse the scalar field .",
    "the electric charge effect on the gravitational collapse can be affected by the charge conjugation strength which was first discovered in the asymptotically flat space - time in @xcite .",
    "here we have confirmed their result in the de sitter spacetime that the electric charge effect due to the change of the charge conjugation is perturbative in the threshold of the black hole formation .",
    "furthermore , we have disclosed a new result that the electric charge effect in the dynamical competition can be completely controlled by the initial conditions in perturbations .",
    "this is similar to the other two effects caused by the gravitational energy and kinetic energy , respectivily .",
    "tuning the parameters in the initial conditions of the charged scalar perturbation , we can obtain richer physics . instead of always being the perturbative effect for the electric charge due to the change of the charge conjugation , the increase of the electric charge results from the change of the initial conditions can present us the repulsive effect to prevent the gravitational collapse .",
    "but when the gravitational binding energy dominates , the further increase of the electric charge due to the change of the initial condition of perturbation can not change the property of the formation of a black hole .",
    "we have checked the properties of stability in the gravitational collapse for the charged scalar field perturbation in spherically symmetric de sitter spacetime in different dimensions and found that the phenomenon we discovered holds for a rather general class of initial perturbations . combining with the universal results for the gravitational collapse in asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite and anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite in various dimensional spacetimes , we can conclude that the dynamics of the gravitational collapse is qualitatively independent of spacetime dimension .",
    "this is different from the stability property of the highly charged reissner - nordstrom black hole in de sitter spacetimes . at this moment",
    "we can not give the reason on the differences .",
    "the stability of highly charged black hole in de sitter spacetime was obtained from the linear perturbation study , while the gravitational collapse result was derived from the nonlinear perturbation theory .",
    "we do not know whether the nonlinear perturbation of the stability analysis can kill the dimensional influence on the property in the stability of the highly charged reissner - nordstrom - de sitter black holes . to answer this question ,",
    "more computations are needed .",
    "we thank eleftherios papantonopoulos , li - wei ji and yun - qi liu for helpful discussions .",
