    "the study of porous and heterogeneous media is scattered throughout many fields of science , including mathematics , solid state physics and chemistry , materials science , geology , hydrology , environmental technology , petroleum engineering and separation technology .",
    "the central problem is the specification of the random microstructure , which is needed to predict macroscopic physical properties ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite for overviews ) .",
    "a complete specification of the random microstructure is both impractical and unnecessary .",
    "it is therefore important to have a general statistical description of the microstructure available .",
    "such a description should meet four criteria : it should be well - defined in terms of geometrical quantities , it should involve only experimentally accessible parameters , it should be of economical size and it should be usable in exact or approximate solutions of the underlying equations of motion .",
    "currently there are only two statistical methodologies available which fulfill all four requirements ; these are correlation functions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and local geometry distributions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the recently developed local geometry distributions are a functional generalization of the correlation - function approach@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to increase the practical applicability of local geometry distributions .",
    "interest in these distributions arises from their potential use in distinguishing between different microstructures@xcite .",
    "increasing their practical applicability is particularly important because local geometry distributions can be used in mean field theory calculations of the dielectric and transport properties of various porous media , for instance porous rock filled with brine@xcite@xcite .",
    "preliminary comparisons of the theory with experimental results have already been carried out , and show good agreement@xcite@xcite .",
    "two main objectives will be pursued in the present paper .",
    "first , we show the feasibility of obtaining three - dimensional local porosity distributions(lpds ) , by presenting data from a real sandstone specimen .",
    "second , we show to what extent three - dimensional lpds can be obtained from purely two - dimensional observations . the dependence of lpds upon the dimensionality of the system is a consequence of their dependence on a measurement cell or observation region over which geometric observables , such as porosity , are averaged .",
    "the possibility of extracting three - dimensional distributions from two - dimensional data arises from limit theorems which guarantee that the asymptotic lpds become independent of the shape of the measurement cell@xcite .",
    "we begin our discussion with a definition of lpds .",
    "next we present a simple argument based on the central limit theorem showing that for large measurement cells , three - dimensional lpds can be mapped onto two - dimensional lpds by a simple rescaling of lengths .",
    "then , we show that this mapping becomes exact for the percolation model .",
    "subsequently , we analyse the overlapping sphere ( or continuum percolation ) model , where the mapping holds only asymptotically .",
    "finally we present the first measurement of three - dimensional lpds .",
    "these are obtained from the pore - space reconstruction of a real sandstone specimen .",
    "the main result of our investigation is the fact that the mapping between two- and three - dimensional lpds can be determined from purely two - dimensional observations if the medium is homogeneous and isotropic . for general anisotropic media",
    "however , the family of three - dimensional lpds can only be determined from a three - dimensional measurement .",
    "the discretized porous medium is considered to occupy a set @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of integers .",
    "pore - space is denoted by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "considering for simplicity only two - component media , we define matrix - space @xmath4 as the complement of @xmath5 , @xmath6 . the characteristic function of a set @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "to describe the state of each point in the system , we label each point in @xmath10 with an index @xmath11 and define the random variables @xmath12 a specific geometry is then specified by the @xmath13-tuple @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of elements in @xmath16 .",
    "the probability space for the system is the triple @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the sample space consisting of all possible geometries @xmath19 .",
    "the event space @xmath20 is a boolean algebra of subsets of @xmath18 .",
    "the probability @xmath21 of finding a geometry is defined on sets of geometries @xmath22 .",
    "however , we assume that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . ]",
    "@xmath19 is a finitely additive non - negative set function defined on @xmath20 , such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a stochastic medium is homogenous if @xmath21 is invariant under translations .",
    "isotropy is defined analogously as invariance under rotations .",
    "the expectation value of a random variable @xmath27 is @xmath28 and in the following , we will use the notation @xmath29 for the moment functions @xmath30 and cumulant functions @xmath31 of order @xmath32 .",
    "for homogeneous media , @xmath33 is the expected bulk porosity .    given a measurement cell denoted as @xmath34 , we define the local porosity of @xmath35 as the random variable @xmath36 the local porosity distribution(lpd)@xcite for @xmath35 can be defined as@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dirac delta function , and the first moment of this lpd is @xmath39 using the definition of @xmath40 , and changing the order of summation gives @xmath41 @xmath42 where we have also used the definition of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we obtain the expression @xmath44 for homogeneous media , @xmath45 , the bulk porosity , so that @xmath46 . similarly , we can show that the local porosity variance @xmath47 = \\mbox{\\- } \\int_{0}^{1}\\mbox{\\-}\\,\\left(\\phi-\\overline{\\phi\\left({\\mathbf{k}}\\right)}\\right)^{2 } \\mbox{\\-}\\mu(\\phi;{\\mathbf{k}})\\,d\\phi$ ] is given by @xmath48 = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{k}|^{2 } }    \\sum_{{\\mathbf{r , r^ { ' } \\in z}}^{d } } c_{2}({\\mathbf{r , r}}^ { ' } )    \\chi_{\\mathbf{k}}({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\chi_{\\mathbf{k}}({\\mathbf{r}}^ { ' } ) \\label{var}\\ ] ] if the medium is homogeneous we can perform one of the sums . in this case @xmath49 . defining @xmath50 , and using the fact that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the set @xmath35 translated by the vector @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54 =   \\sum_{{\\mathbf{y \\in z}}^{d } }     \\frac{|\\mathbf{k \\cap ( k - y)}|}{|\\mathbf{k}|^{2 } } c_{2}({\\mathbf{0,y } } ) \\label{homo.var}\\ ] ] note that the variance @xmath47 $ ]",
    "is simply related to the granularity concept which is used for photographic materials@xcite .",
    "the relations above are applicable to infinitely large realizations of homogeneous stochastic media .",
    "consider again the class of homogeneous media in which spatial correlations of the random geometry decay with a finite correlation - length @xmath55 . for such systems",
    ", we can apply the central limit theorem to measurements of local porsity for very large measurement cells . to do this ,",
    "we partition a @xmath56-dimensional hypercubic measurement cell @xmath57 of side @xmath58 into @xmath59 hypercubic subcells @xmath60 , of side @xmath61 so that @xmath62 and rewrite @xmath63 as the average @xmath64 over all the subcell porosities @xmath65 . if we choose @xmath58 and @xmath61 such that @xmath66 , then @xmath67 , and the central limit theorem becomes applicable , because the @xmath65 are weakly correlated random variables .",
    "the central limit theorem ensures the existence of a number @xmath68 such that @xmath69\\ ] ] were the accuracy of the approximate equality improves as @xmath70 increases . in the limit @xmath71",
    "subject to @xmath72 , one has @xmath73 , independent of dimension and independent of @xmath57 .",
    "hence , for @xmath70 sufficiently large but still finite , the form of @xmath74 depends only on the bulk porosity @xmath75 and the variance @xmath76 = \\sigma^{2}/(l / a)^{d}$ ] , but not on the shape of @xmath35 .",
    "if the medium is also isotropic , then a sufficient condition for the equality of two such limiting distributions for @xmath56 and @xmath77-dimensional measurement cells in the same medium is thus @xmath78 because @xmath75 will be the same in both cases .",
    "thus we find that for homogeneous isotropic systems with finite correlation - length , two- and three - dimensional lpds for large @xmath58 are simply related by a rescaling of lengths .",
    "we now examine the site percolation model , for which the scaling relation is exact .",
    "in the site percolation model , each lattice site has a probability @xmath79 of being occupied and @xmath80 of being empty that is independent of the other sites . therefore ,",
    "if we consider occupied sites to be pore and empty sites as matrix , @xmath81 depends only on @xmath79 and @xmath82 , and is given by the binomial distribution .",
    "if the underlying lattice is hypercubic , then the lpd for a @xmath56-dimensional hypercubic measurement cell @xmath35 of side @xmath58 is @xmath83!\\:\\left[l^{d}\\ ,                  \\left(1-\\phi_{i}\\right)\\right]!}\\ ;                  \\langle\\phi \\rangle^{\\,l^{d}\\phi_{i}}\\,(1-                  \\langle \\phi \\rangle ) ^{\\,l^{d}(1-\\phi_i)}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",
    "measurement cells consisting of the same number of points must have identical lpds .",
    "therefore , if @xmath85 is a @xmath77-dimensional measurement cell of side @xmath86 @xmath87    the scaling relation @xmath88 is not solvable in @xmath1 for all @xmath89 .",
    "nevertheless , there exist infinitely many solutions , since each positive integer @xmath11 yields the solution @xmath90 therefore , for the site percolation model , two- and three - dimendional lpds are , within the constraints imposed by the discrete nature of the model , simply related by a rescaling of lengths .",
    "an often useful grain model for porous media is obtained by randomly distributing overlapping spheres .",
    "the spheres represent grains of matrix material .",
    "a model configuration is typically created by randomly distributing point - centers with constant point - density in a given volume and attaching a sphere of radius @xmath91 to each point - center .",
    "the system analyzed below was obtained by randomly distributing 8000 point - centers in a volume of 256x256x256 voxels .",
    "a value of @xmath92 voxels has been used , and periodic boundary conditions have been implemented .",
    "the bulk porosity of the overlapping sphere model is @xmath93 $ ] , where @xmath94 is the point - density .",
    "the point density and sphere radius were chosen such that @xmath95 , matching the porosity of a real sandstone specimen discussed below . a plane - section showing the degree of discretization",
    "is displayed in figure  [ fig : pp0pgm ] .    .    .    .",
    "three - dimensional lpds for @xmath96 have been measured , and the resulting family of distributions is shown in figures  [ fig : p183dmu ] .",
    "two - dimensional lpds were obtained for @xmath97 by averaging the measured distributions for all cross - sections perpendicular to the z - axis .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : p182dmu ] . to investigate the degree of correspondence between two- and three - dimensional lpds",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath98 as a quantitative measure of the deviation between two distributions . for fixed @xmath58 ,",
    "we minimize @xmath99 by varying @xmath86 .",
    "the matched distributions selected by this criterion are shown in figure  [ fig : p18corr ] for a choice of @xmath100-values indicated in the figure for each matching pair .",
    "the agreement between the matched two- and three - dimensional distributions is satisfactory .",
    "the agreement for large @xmath58 stipulated by the central limit theorem improves with better system - statistics .",
    "this is seen from the matched lpds shown in figure  [ fig : c2corr ] , for a system of 64000 instead of 8000 spheres , having the same voxel - dimensions and bulk porosity .",
    "the poorer sphere - resolution of @xmath101 pixels makes this configuration less suitable for analyzing @xmath40 at smaller length - scales , so we shall not discuss this configuration further .    .    .",
    "the matching of distributions based on @xmath99 is shown as the solid line in figure  [ fig : p18scale ] .",
    "another matching of distributions is obtained from the criterion of equal variances established in section  3 .",
    "the mapping @xmath102 obtained from the equal - variance criterion is shown as the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : p18scale ] . for lengths that are",
    "not too large relative to the size of the system , both criteria give more or less the same rescaling of lengths @xmath102 .",
    "note , however , that the discretization can affect @xmath102 at small @xmath58 .    .    in practical applications ,",
    "it is important to estimate the three - dimensional lpds from observations on two - dimensional cross - sections alone . in the matching above , however , it was assumed that the three - dimensional lpds are known . a way out of this dilemma",
    "is provided by equations ( [ homo.var ] ) and ( [ approx.scaling ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the dashed and the solid lines in figure  [ fig : p18scale ] validates the matching criterion based solely on the variances expressed in equation ( [ approx.scaling ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , equation ( [ homo.var ] ) allows us to estimate the variance from @xmath103 measured on two - dimensional cross - sections as long as the system is isotropic .",
    "the results of such a matching procedure are shown as the dotted and the dash - dotted curves in figure  [ fig : p18scale ] .",
    "the dotted curve uses a direct measurement of @xmath104 from two - dimensional sections , while the dash - dotted curve uses the exactly known analytical form of @xmath104 .",
    "the direct measurement of @xmath104 uses the same series of planar - sections as the measurement of the two - dimensional lpds ; the correlation function is first calculated in each plane and subsequently averaged over all planes . the necessity to average over all planes , and the influence of discretization effects",
    "were recently discussed systematically@xcite .",
    "the resulting averaged two - point correlation function @xmath105 is shown in figure  [ fig : p18 g ] . because the model of overlapping spheres is homogeneous and isotropic @xmath106 .",
    "the exact analytical expression for @xmath107 is given as @xmath108\\ ] ] @xmath94 is the density of point - centers , @xmath56 is the sphere - diameter , @xmath109 is the volume of the set @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the ball of radius @xmath112 around @xmath113 .",
    "the exact @xmath114 vanishes for @xmath115 , and is shown as the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : p18 g ] .",
    "visible discrepencies between the measured and analytical curves are due to insufficient system - statistics .    .",
    "the satisfactory agreement of the dotted and the dash - dotted curves in figure  [ fig : p18scale ] results from the isotropy of the overlapping sphere model . the isotropy condition @xmath116 guarantees knowledge of the full function @xmath117 from a measurement along any ray .",
    "knowledge of the full function is a prerequisite for calculating the three - dimensional variance from ( [ homo.var ] ) .",
    "hence , the above precedure is not applicable for general anisotropic media .    to assess the relative reliability of our rescaling procedure for isotropic systems , we compare in figure  [ fig : p18var ] the two- and three - dimensional variances computed from the exact and measured correlation functions @xmath114 with those computed from the local porosity distribution @xmath74 .",
    "solid lines are variances computed from @xmath74 , dashed lines are variances computed from the measured @xmath114 and dotted lines are variances computed using the analytical @xmath114 .",
    "the overall agreement is satisfactory , given that the side length of the whole system is only 256 voxels .    .",
    "in this section , we analyse experimental data .",
    "the three - dimensional pore - space for a specimen of savonnier oolithic sandstone was reconstructed from serial thin sections@xcite .",
    "the data - set consists of 99 binary images , each of 1904x1904 pixels , representing planar cross - sections through the medium .",
    "the distance between the planes of consecutive images is @xmath118 m .",
    "this is also the pixel size .",
    "each section was obtained by thresholding a digitized micrograph into a black and white image .",
    "the threshold value was chosen to match the experimentally - known bulk porosity of @xmath119 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eslice ] shows part of a typical image measuring approximately 1 cm along each side . in figure",
    "[ fig : eblock ] we show a three - dimensional cubic subset with a side length of 1 mm , in which the pore - space is shown in black , the matrix is transparent and the pore - space boundary is gray .    .    .",
    "figure  [ fig : eblock ] shows that the pore - space is anisotropic .",
    "this is corroborated in figure  [ fig : eg ] , where the correlation function @xmath120 , measured in the plane of the thin sections is shown together with @xmath121 measured in the direction normal to the thin sections .",
    "the anisotropy is at least partly caused by the misalignments of individual images and variations in lighting and thresholding during the reconstruction .",
    "the correlation function @xmath120 also shows the existence of large - scale heterogeneities .",
    "given these imperfections we do not expect to be able to reconstruct the three - dimensional lpds from two - dimensional information alone .    .",
    "the family of three - dimensional lpds is displayed in figure  [ fig : e3dmu ] .",
    "the family of two - dimensional lpds is displayed in figure  [ fig : e2dmu ] .",
    "the three - dimensional distributions have been measured on a sub - system of 1881x1881x99 voxels for measurement cell sizes @xmath122 .",
    "the bulk porosity of the sub - system is 0.1861 .",
    "the results displayed in figure  [ fig : e3dmu ] are , to our knowledge , the first measurements of three - dimensional lpds on a natural rock sample .",
    "the two - dimensional lpds shown for @xmath123 were obtained , as before , by averaging the distributions for each plane .    .    .",
    "figure  [ fig : evar ] shows the two- and three - dimensional variances computed directly from the distributions as solid lines .",
    "the dashed lines are variances obtained using @xmath124 in ( [ homo.var ] ) .",
    "the poor agreement for @xmath125 is to be expected , since @xmath126 , as seen in figure  [ fig : eg ] .",
    "hence , we can not make an independent determination of the three - dimensional variance from the two - dimensional data , and are unable to construct the mapping @xmath102 based on two - dimensional correlation functions .    .",
    "nevertheless , a matching between two- and three - dimensional lpds can be obtained based on @xmath99 as discussed above .",
    "the results of the @xmath127-matching procedure are shown in figure  [ fig : ecorr ] for a selection of @xmath128-pairs indicated in the figure .",
    "the agreement is of similar quality as that for the overlapping sphere model .    .",
    "the present paper has investigated the dimensional dependence of local porosity distributions , which formalize the idea of length - scale dependent spatial averaging ( coarse - graining ) .",
    "we have presented the first determinations of lpds for real porous media .",
    "we have shown that in general , in the limit of large measurement cells(averaging regions ) , the two- and three - dimensional lpds can be mapped onto each other by a rescaling of lengths @xmath102 .",
    "this result was based on the central limit theorem and the concept of stationarity .",
    "we have found that the mapping @xmath102 extends below the asymptotic regime to much smaller length - scales .",
    "this result is important for both practical applications and because it agrees with the possibility of intermediate limit laws for lpds based on generalizations of the central limit theorem@xcite .",
    "an equally important result of this paper is the finding that the mapping @xmath102 can be determined from purely two - dimensional measurements .",
    "however , this result is restricted to homogeneous isotropic media .",
    "we illustrated our results with three examples .",
    "for the percolation model , the analytical form of the mapping @xmath102 between two- and three - dimensional lpds is exactly known , and the agreement between mapped distributions becomes perfect .",
    "for the homogeneous isotropic overlapping sphere model , the agreement between mapped distributions is satisfactory for measurement cells of side @xmath129 and improves with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "the mapping @xmath102 can be successfully determined from two - dimensional observations alone for this medium .",
    "the three - dimensional pore - space reconstruction for the savonnier oolithic sandstone specimen is clearly anisotropic and shows large - scale heterogeneities .",
    "the anisotropy of the reconstructed pore - space does not allow one to construct the mapping @xmath102 from two - dimensional observations .",
    "nevertheless , the mapped curves from two- and three - dimensional measurements again show good agreement .",
