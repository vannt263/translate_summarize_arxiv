    "there have been extensive studies of a light gauge boson of the subelectroweak scale in the past decade .",
    "it might be hard to expect such a light gauge boson in the rather traditional view that sizes of the gauge coupling should be similar to each other , backed by an idea of the gauge coupling unification . yet , many studies of a light gauge boson @xcite that could address some notable phenomena , such as the positron excess @xcite and the muon @xmath1 anomaly @xcite , have been gradually changing the view .",
    "( for a review , see ref .",
    "the possibility of a very light gauge boson opens up new avenues to search for a new fundamental force @xcite .",
    "many models for a light gauge boson have been suggested and studied .",
    "( for some examples , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in particular , extensive studies have been done with the dark photon model @xcite , which exploits a kinetic mixing between a dark @xmath2 gauge symmetry and the standard model ( sm ) hypercharge @xmath3 @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the dark photon based on the kinetic mixing can be considered as the simplest gauge model as it does not require any new matter fields .",
    "the sm particles do not have charges under the dark @xmath2 , and the feebleness of the coupling comes from a small value of the kinetic mixing parameter ( @xmath4 ) .    on the other hand , the extension of the sm matter contents with the right - handed neutrinos",
    "are well motivated with the current neutrino mass and mixing data , and a mere extension of the sm with three right - handed neutrinos allows the @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 an arbitrary real number ) as an anomaly - free gauge symmetry without an introduction of exotic matter fields @xcite .",
    "this symmetry can also play as a gauge origin of the matter parity , or the @xmath7-parity in the supersymmetry framework , depending on the @xmath2 charge of the additional scalar . unlike the dark photon case",
    ", a light gauge boson of this symmetry has explicit charges for the sm particles with a small gauge coupling constant .",
    "it is also possible for this gauge symmetry to mix with the @xmath3 through the kinetic mixing . in some sense",
    ", it is the most general minimal gauge extension of the sm added by three right - handed neutrinos . for convenience",
    ", we call this gauge interaction mediated by a light gauge boson _ mini force _ , implying that it is mediated by a gauge boson with a very small mass and a feeble coupling from the minimal gauge extension of the sm , the @xmath5 with an additional kinetic mixing @xmath8 . ) and the hypercharge shift ( @xmath9 ) share many indistinguishable features . ]",
    "the phenomenology and search schemes of a light gauge boson can be significantly different depending on its coupling to the sm particles .",
    "for instance , as emphasized in the dark @xmath10 model @xcite , an additional axial coupling can provide a very different phenomenology in its production from a heavy particle decay and the parity violation tests .",
    "thus it is of great importance to study the details of the model and identify the similarities and differences compared to other models for a proper study of a light gauge boson .",
    "in particular , the mini force model involves an explicit assignment of the hypercharge , which contains an axial coupling .",
    "we will perform a thorough study of the light gauge boson of this model including the axial coupling part .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dark photon overview ] , we go over the coupling of the popular dark photon , which exploits the gauge kinetic mixing . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : higgs ] , we discuss the implications for the rare higgs decay . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parity ] , we discuss the implications for the parity violation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we discuss our findings and summarize the results .",
    "in this section , we briefly overview the dark photon model @xcite , which relies on the kinetic mixing for the coupling . in the dark photon model , an extra gauge group",
    "is considered as the dark @xmath2 , under which the sm particles do not carry the charges .",
    "the gauge boson of the dark @xmath2 can still interact with the sm particles through the gauge kinetic mixing of the dark @xmath2 with the sm hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "( in addition to this vector portal , the higgs portal at the scalar sector such as @xmath11 can also connect the sm to the dark sector , but we do not consider this portal in this paper and constrain our discussion to the @xmath12 interaction . )    since the field tensor of any abelian gauge group is gauge invariant , a kinetic mixing between two abelian gauge groups is not forbidden and the kinetic terms are generally given as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are gauge bosons of the @xmath3 and the dark @xmath2 , respectively , and a hatted field means that it is not a physical eigenstate yet .",
    "@xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter for the kinetic mixing , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are with weinberg angle @xmath19 of the sm , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the kinetic terms in eq .",
    "are diagonalized by a @xmath21 transformation @xcite , which can be divided into two steps : first , orthogonalizing the kinetic terms @xmath22 and then a wavefunction normalization @xmath23 the kinetic mixing is constrained to be very small , i.e. , @xmath24 , by the electroweak precision test @xcite and other experiments ( for instance , see ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the next leading order of eq .  , which in @xmath25 is so small regardless of the other properties of the @xmath12 such as its mass , and we ignore the normalization process of eq .",

    "it is clear that the diagonalization of the kinetic terms by @xmath21 gives a @xmath26 shift proportional to @xmath4 to both the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 .",
    "now , we need to go to the physical eigenstates or mass eigenstates . as the photon is massless",
    ", the @xmath28 is the same as the physical eigenstate @xmath29 .",
    "however , as the @xmath30 boson gets a mass from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet , there is an induced mass mixing of @xmath30 and @xmath31 because of the shift in eq .  .",
    "the mass matrix in the basis of @xmath32 is given by [ eq : massmatrixindp ] where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",

    "shows , @xmath44 is the physical @xmath12 fraction in the interaction eigenstate @xmath45 boson .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12 coupling to the sm neutral current is proportional to the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the first term in @xmath46 is from the mass mixing and the second term is from the kinetic mixing , and as we will see there is a cancellation of the two for a very light @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 interaction lagrangian then can be written as _ = - ( e j_^+ _",
    "z g_z j_^ ) z _ where @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer to the appropriately defined sm electromagnetic current and the weak neutral current , respectively .",
    "when the @xmath12 is sufficiently lighter than the sm @xmath10 boson , @xmath49 is approximated to be @xmath50 which tells us that the axial coupling of the @xmath12 is proportional to the @xmath51 .",
    "this is why the axial coupling is neglected in most dark photon studies , where @xmath52 is often taken ( gev or sub - gev scale ) @xcite .    , which assesses the axial coupling of the @xmath12 with @xmath53 for a few choices of @xmath4 ( or @xmath54 ) .",
    "for @xmath55 , the @xmath56 increases with @xmath53 proportional to @xmath57 and becomes insensitive to @xmath53 for @xmath58 . ]",
    "there are a few ways in which a light gauge boson can obtain sizable axial couplings though .",
    "they include ( i ) to employ a relatively large mass , ( ii ) to assume a nonminimal higgs structure , and ( iii ) to assign explicit nonzero @xmath2 charges to the sm particles rather than depending on the kinetic mixing .",
    "we will briefly discuss these possibilities now .",
    "figure  [ fig : plotofaxialcouplingconstant ] shows the @xmath53 dependence of the @xmath49 .",
    "we can see that it follows eq .   for @xmath59 .",
    "while the @xmath12 of the gev or sub - gev scale has a tiny axial coupling , the axial coupling becomes quite sizable as @xmath53 approaches @xmath60 .",
    "near @xmath61 , a peak of the @xmath62 appears because the maximal mass mixing is achieved in eq .  .",
    "however , the precisely measured @xmath10 pole and other experimental data constrain the @xmath10-@xmath12 mass mixing , and in turn the @xmath4 . it was found that @xmath63 for @xmath59 , but the constraint becomes much more severe for the peak region @xcite . in the region of @xmath64 , the @xmath49 does not follow eq .   and",
    "it rather behaves as _ z - t_w , [ eq : azdinlargemasslimit ] which is quite obvious from eq .   in the @xmath65 limit .    as the above discussion heavily depends on the mass matrix in eq .",
    ", it may be possible for the @xmath12 to possess a sizable axial coupling even for quite a small mass ( @xmath52 ) if a different higgs structure is assumed .",
    "this idea was actually exploited in the dark @xmath10 model with an additional higgs doublet that can contribute to the @xmath12 mass as well as the @xmath10 mass @xcite .    in the previous two cases , the @xmath12 coupling to the sm particles is generated by the mixings , but the nonzero explicit @xmath2 charge assignment with a small gauge coupling constant is another possible way to introduce a light @xmath12 .",
    "it will have an axial coupling to the sm particles if the charges are assigned in a chiral way .",
    "in the next section , we will discuss this case in detail .",
    "now , we consider a @xmath2 gauge symmetry which has an explicit charge assignment to the sm particles . specifically , we consider the gauged @xmath66 , which is a linear combination of the @xmath67 and the hypercharge @xmath68 with a real number @xmath6 .",
    "this is the only possible family universal , anomaly - free gauge extension of the sm with only three right - handed neutrinos and no additional matter content @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath67 provides only a vector coupling , the additional @xmath69 part presents an axial coupling , which might be interesting in our discussion . the kinetic mixing between this @xmath70 and the sm @xmath3",
    "is still allowed in the same form of eq .  , and we consider the effect of this mixing as well .",
    "in addition to the mass mixing between @xmath45 and @xmath15 from @xmath71 , an additional mass mixing is expected to emerge due to the imposed hypercharge in the mini force model .",
    "the mass matrix in the basis of @xmath32 is given by [ eq : massmatrixinnd ] with an effective @xmath4 defined as _",
    "x+ , [ eq : replacedvarepsiloninnd ] which is the same as the @xmath4 in the @xmath72 limit , and the other notations are the same as in the previous section .",
    "we can see , compared to the dark photon model in eq .  , an additional mass mixing due to the @xmath73 part is present in the mass matrix .    following the similar steps of the previous section , one can obtain the @xmath49 corresponding to the mini force model along with the kinetic mixing , @xmath74 where the mass mixing angle @xmath43 is given by eq .  , with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath12 interaction lagrangian in this model then can be written as _ = - ( g_z j_^+ _ x e",
    "j_^+ _ z g_z j_^ ) z _ ,   [ eq : zprimeinteraction ] where @xmath75 refers to the @xmath67 vector current .",
    "while the comprehensive studies on the constraints on the kinetic mixing @xmath4 @xcite and the @xmath67 gauge coupling @xmath38 @xcite are separately well archived in the literature , we note that the combined study of the two parameters is lacking and is worth pursuing in the future .    notwithstanding the obvious differences between the models ,",
    "the formalism of the dark photon model and the mini force model show indistinguishable properties in some aspects , including the axial coupling part .",
    "compared to the dark photon model , which has only two relevant model parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath4 ) , the mini force model has four model parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath38 ) . but as one can see from eqs .   - , there are essentially only three parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath38 ) that are relevant to the physics of the @xmath12 interaction that we are interested in . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the couplings of the mini force model , focusing on the similarity of the formalism with the dark photon model .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath12 can be studied with the relevant part of the covariant derivative , @xmath76 where the last term in eq .",
    "exploits the result of the @xmath71 in eq .  ,",
    "and eq .   collects all parts that are directly related to the axial coupling , i.e. , @xmath68 part , with the @xmath54 defined in eq .  .",
    "now one can see that the overall consequence of the kinetic mixing diagonalization and the hypercharge shift is @xmath77    both the hypercharge shift and the kinetic mixing cause the redefinition of the hypercharge gauge boson in eq .",
    ", which is why both can be parametrized by the single parameter @xmath54 of eq .  .",
    "it means the kinetic mixing and the hypercharge shift are indistinguishable and there is no way to tell the difference between the two .",
    "the mini force model is , thus , the same as the pure @xmath67 model ( i.e. , with @xmath72 ) , with the kinetic mixing altered appropriately , i.e. in eq .  , which was ignored because of its very small effect .",
    "the full expression should be written as @xmath78 for eq .  , which means that the wavefunction normalization is still with @xmath4 , not @xmath54 .",
    "this normalization process does not alter the indistinguishability between the kinetic mixing and the hypercharge shift .",

    ".   - .",
    "we can conclude that , although it might be somewhat counterintuitive , the axial coupling of the @xmath12 in this explicit charge assignment can not be large for the very light @xmath12 because of the essentially same cancellation between the two terms in eq .   as in eq .  .",
    "the axial coupling of the @xmath12 in this model can be enhanced with an increase of the @xmath53 in a similar manner to the dark photon model .",

    "it occurred earlier than the direct discovery of the @xmath176 and @xmath10 resonances at the 1983 cern sps experiments @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . )",
    "a similar path might lie ahead of us in the discovery of a light gauge boson , if it exists , which has been a topic of great interest recently .",
    "there are at least two important aspects to think that the axial couplings are more important in searching for a light gauge boson compared to the traditional heavy or tev - scale gauge boson searches @xcite .",
    "first , when the gauge boson is light , it is easily boosted from the decay of a heavy particle ( such as mesons or the higgs boson ) , and this interaction is governed by the goldstone boson equivalence theorem controlled by an axial coupling .",
    "second , there are ongoing and proposed parity tests at the low - momentum transfer @xcite , which may be particularly sensitive for a light gauge boson .",
    "in fact , the light gauge boson contribution in the weinberg angle shift is sensitive only at the low - momentum transfer @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the interaction mediated by a light gauge boson of the @xmath0 symmetry in addition to the kinetic mixing with the sm hypercharge , which we call mini force .",
    "this minimal gauge extension of the sm added by only three right - handed neutrinos is a very plausible scenario , and it has an explicit charge assignment , which contains the axial coupling .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ambiguity of kinetic mixing and hypercharge shift ] , a hypercharge shift and a gauge kinetic mixing have an indistinguishable consequence in the mixing of the @xmath12 and the sm hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "in other words , the mini force model can be considered as the pure @xmath67 model with an altered kinetic mixing .",
    "there is some cancellation in the physical eigenstate and as a result the axial coupling of the light gauge boson of the mini force model is highly suppressed .",
    "we investigated this phenomenon and also studied the implications of the suppressed axial coupling .",
    "there are some aspects in its implications that produce the same results as the dark photon model ( e.g. rare higgs decay ) and there are other aspects that produce different results ( e.g. parity test ) . with the various constraints ,",
    "these effects are too small to be observed in the near future for a very light gauge boson ( say , @xmath165 ) , but the effects for an intermediate - scale gauge boson [ @xmath177 can be large enough to be observed in the planned experiments such as the lhc run2 experiments and the jlab moller experiments .    the suppression of the axial coupling for a light gauge boson is somewhat expected from the fact that a massless gauge boson can not have an axial coupling . as a straightforward symmetry argument , it is obvious that the axial current of a massless gauge boson vanishes when a chiral fermion is massive .",
    "a massless gauge boson implies that the vacuum does not break spontaneously the corresponding gauge symmetry .",
    "since helicities ( left and right ) of a fermion are flipped at a mass term , there is a contradiction that a chiral fermion is massive when a gauge boson is massless .",
    "consequently , a massless gauge boson possesses no axial current for a massive fermion .",
    "it is still imperative to acknowledge that a sizable axial coupling for a very light , but not massless , gauge boson may exist depending on the details of the model including the scalar sector @xcite .",
    "we discussed the general conditions that a new gauge interaction should possess for the maximal effect in parity violation tests .",
    "for an example , the effects can be sizable enough to be observed for the intermediate - scale mass as we illustrated .",
    "more cases will be discussed in subsequent studies @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by ibs under the project code , ibs - r018-d1 .",
    "h. l. thanks h. davoudiasl and w. marciano for the long - time collaboration on the light gauge boson .",
    "the sm fermion currents coupling to the vector bosons @xmath14 , @xmath178 , and @xmath15 are given by @xmath179 where j_y^ & = & _ f |f^(y_f_l+q_f)f , + j_w_3^ & = & _ f t_3f|f^()f , + j_^ & = & _ f ( b - l+xy)_f|f^f , and @xmath180 . after the electroweak mixing by the weinberg angle @xmath19 and diagonalizing gauge kinetic terms , @xmath181 where j_^ & = & _ f q_f|f^f , + j_^ & = & _ f ( -q_f s_w^2)|f^f -|f^^5 f .",
    "considering mass mixing between @xmath45 and @xmath15 , we get @xmath182 where j_z^ & = & _ f \\ { |f^f + & & .+|f^^5 f } , + j_z^ & = & _ f \\{|f^f + & & .+|f^^5 f } . the mass mixing angle @xmath43 is given as & = & + , + & = & - , with m^2m_z^2-m_z^2 , which is the mass - squared difference between two physical eigenstates , @xmath10 and @xmath12 , given as m_z^2 & = & m_^2(1+t_w ) , + m_z^2 & = & m_^2(1-t_w^-1 ) .",
    "the scalar kinetic terms with an extra singlet scalar @xmath36 , charged only under the extra @xmath2 , are given by _ = | d__h|^2 + | d__s|^2 , where @xmath183 with the doublet @xmath184^+@xmath185(v+h+i_3)/@xmath186 and the singlet @xmath187 .    for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the higgs portal term @xmath188 .",
    "the relevant couplings of the sm - like higgs @xmath84 are given by @xmath189 where c_hzz & = & _ z^2 + c_hzz & = & _ z_z + c_hzz & = & _ z^2 , with @xmath190 .",
    "using the above results , the on - shell decay rate in each channel is given by _",
    "hzz & = & ( 2 + ) + & & ( 1-)^3 , [ eq : decayrateofhtozz ] with @xmath191 , _",
    "hzz & = & ( 3 + - ) + & & c_hzz^2 [ eq : decayrateofhtozz ] .",
    "the decay rates for the light @xmath12 , when it is boosted , can be understood by the goldstone boson equivalence theorem . assuming no higgs portal term",
    ", the pseudoscalars coupling to the sm - like higgs only come from the doublet .",
    "thus , we have to find a fraction of the @xmath192 of the longitudinal mode of the @xmath12 .",
    "the relevant lagrangian for the vector boson connected to the goldstone boson in the mini force model with the effective kinetic mixing @xmath54 is given by - _ = m__^_3 + m__^_s where @xmath193 is the goldstone boson of the @xmath194 absorbed by @xmath15 .",
    "in the physical eigenstate after the diagonalizations , the @xmath12 part is given as & & ( m__z^_3 + m_^_s)z _ + & = & m_z(_z^_3 + ^_s)z _ .",
    "therefore , the decay rate of the @xmath195 with @xmath10 and @xmath12 replaced by the relevant goldstone bosons is proportional to ( v)^2(_z)^2 c_hzz^2 _ z^2 where @xmath196 is the quartic coupling constant of the higgs doublet .",
    "this gives essentially the same result as eq .  .",

    "<S> the relevant phenomenology and the best search schemes of a subelectroweak - scale gauge boson can be vastly different depending on its coupling . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the rare decay into a light gauge boson and the high precision parity test can be sensitive if it has an axial coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal gauge extension of the standard model with the @xmath0 requires only three right - handed neutrinos , well - suited to the current neutrino mass and mixing data , and no additional exotic matter fields . </S>",
    "<S> we study the light gauge boson of this symmetry in detail including its axial coupling property from the hypercharge shift . </S>"
