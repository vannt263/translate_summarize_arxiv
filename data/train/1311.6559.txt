    "the ever - growing population of known multiple - planet systems has proven to be an exceedingly useful laboratory for testing models of planetary system formation and dynamical evolution .",
    "of particular interest are the systems which are in , or near , resonant configurations .",
    "a number of such systems have been identified from radial - velocity surveys , with some notable examples including gj876 @xcite , hd128311 @xcite , hd82943 @xcite , and hd200964 @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that about 1/3 of well - characterized multi - planet systems were in such low - order period commensurabilities .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission has revealed hundreds of candidate multiply - transiting planetary systems @xcite , some of which are in or near low - order resonances @xcite .",
    "one emerging trend from the _ kepler _ results is that a significant number of such near - resonant planet pairs are outside of the resonance @xcite , with an excess population slightly wide of the resonance , and a deficit of planet pairs just inside the resonance @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently showed that the 4:2:1 laplace resonance in the gj876 system @xcite acts to stabilise the three outer planets , constraining their mutual inclinations to less than 20 degrees and @xmath20.05 .",
    "@xcite applied a dynamical fitting approach to 10 years of precise keck radial velocities of the hd82943 2:1 resonant system @xcite .",
    "they found a best fit at an inclination of 20@xmath34@xmath0  to the sky plane , which was dynamically stable despite the high planetary masses implied by that inclination .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "herschel _ debris disk observations reported by @xcite show that the disk has a similar line - of - sight inclination of 27@xmath34@xmath0 .",
    "these examples show how planetary systems can be characterized with multiple complementary approaches .",
    "hd73526 is one of 20 stars added to the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) in late 1999 , based on high metallicity and the then - emerging planet - metallicity correlation @xcite .",
    "the first planet , hd73526b @xcite , was reported to have period @xmath43.0 d , eccentricity @xmath50.08 , and a minimum mass @xmath6 sin @xmath70.3 .",
    "@xcite reported a second planet with @xmath80.9 days , placing it in the 2:1 resonance with the inner planet .",
    "the authors noted that the 2:1 period commensurability appears to be common , with 4 of the 18 then - known multiple systems moving on such orbits .",
    "the hd 73526 planetary system was reported in a 2:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) , with @xmath9 librating around 0@xmath0  and @xmath10 circulating @xcite , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the lowest order , eccentricity - type 2:1 mmr angles : @xmath11 @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the mean longitude , @xmath14 is the longitude of periapse , and subscripts 1 and 2 represent the inner and outer planets , respectively .",
    "this type of 2:1 mmr configuration is dynamically interesting as it can not be produced by smooth migration capture alone ( beauge et al .",
    "2003 ; ferraz - mello et al . 2003",
    "; lee 2004 ; beauge et al .",
    "2006 ; michtchenko et al .",
    "2008 ) , and alternative mechanisms have been suggested to produce such configuration .",
    "the resonant property of the hd73526 planets makes this an interesting system in terms of its dynamical evolution .",
    "subsequent work has focused on how planets get into the 2:1 resonance in this and other exoplanetary systems .",
    "@xcite proposed that the hd73526 system experienced both migration and a sudden perturbation ( planet - planet scattering or rapid dissipation of the protoplanetary disk ) which combined to drive the system into the observed 2:1 resonance .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that the hd73526 and hd128311 systems , both of which are in 2:1 librating - circulating resonances , arrived in that configuration via a hybrid mechanism of scattering and collisions with terrestrial planetesimals .",
    "scattering into low - order resonances was also implicated by @xcite as a likely formation mechanism , where scattering events drive the two larger planets into a resonance while ejecting the smaller planet . in summary , there is general agreement that the hd73526 system did not arrive in the 2:1 resonance by smooth migration alone .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide an updated set of parameters for the hd73526 system , based on a further 6 years of aaps observations , as well as new data from magellan ( section 2 ) .",
    "in addition , we perform keplerian and full dynamical fits to the complete data set ( section 3 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we present detailed dynamical stability maps of the system , using both the parameters from the keplerian and dynamical fits .",
    "finally , in section 5 we offer conclusions on the architecture of the system based on the combination of our orbit fitting and dynamical stability analysis .",
    "aaps doppler measurements are made with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph point - spread function and wavelength calibration are derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precision doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template , and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "a total of 36 aat observations have been obtained since 1999 feb 2 ( table  [ aatvels ] ) and used in the following analysis , representing a data span of 4836 days .",
    "the exposure times range from 300 to 900 sec , and the mean internal velocity uncertainty for these data is 4.1 .      since hd73526 is among the faintest aaps targets ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "we have obtained supplemental observations with the planet finder spectrograph ( pfs ) @xcite on the 6.5 m magellan ii ( clay ) telescope .",
    "the pfs is a high - resolution ( @xmath16 ) echelle spectrograph optimised for high - precision radial - velocity measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pfs also uses the iodine cell method , as descibed above , to obtain precise radial velocities .",
    "the 20 measurements of hd73526 are given in table  [ pfsvels ] .",
    "the data span 856 days and have a mean internal uncertainty of 1.2 .",
    "new radial - velocity observations of exoplanetary systems can sometimes result in substantial modification of the best - fit planetary orbits .",
    "for example , the two planets in the hd155358 system were initially reported to be in orbital periods of 195 and 530 days @xcite .",
    "a further five years of observations revealed that the outer planet actually has an orbital period of 391.9 days , and is trapped in the 2:1 mean - motion resonance @xcite . in light of the possibility that the best - fit orbits of the two planets may be significantly different than initially presented in @xcite",
    ", we begin our orbit fitting process with a wide - ranging search using a genetic algorithm .",
    "this approach is often used when the orbital parameters of a planet candidate are highly uncertain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or when data are sparse @xcite .",
    "we allowed the genetic algorithm to search a wide parameter space , and it ran for 50,000 iterations , testing a total of about @xmath17 possible configurations .",
    "we then fit the two data sets simultaneously using _ gaussfit _",
    "@xcite , a generalized least - squares program used here to solve a keplerian radial - velocity orbit model .",
    "the _ gaussfit _ model has the ability to allow the offsets between multiple data sets to be a free parameter .",
    "the parameters of the best 2-planet solution obtained by the genetic algorithm were used as initial inputs to _ gaussfit _ , and a jitter of 3.3  was added in quadrature to the uncertainty of each observation ( following tinney et al .",
    "the best - fit keplerian solutions are given in table  [ planetparams ] ; planetary minimum masses @xmath6 sin @xmath18 are derived using a stellar mass of 1.014@xmath30.046  @xcite .",
    "this fit has a reduced @xmath19 of 1.63 and a total rms of 6.32  ( aat  7.67 ; pfs  2.75 ) .      because the two planets are massive enough and orbit close enough to each other to be interacting , we also apply a full dynamical model to these data .",
    "this model includes the effects of planet - planet interactions , and can be used to place constraints on the system s inclination to the sky plane , @xmath18 , a quantity which can not be determined from keplerian fitting alone .",
    "the system inclination then sets the true masses of the planets .",
    "the technique is described fully in @xcite for the hd82943 two - planet system .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) method is adopted as our fitting method .",
    "using the keplerian best fit as an initial guess , assuming coplanar edge - on orbits , the levenberg - marquardt algorithm converges to a local minimum with @xmath20 of about 1.70 and rms of about 6.54 . based on this local minimum",
    ", we conduct a parameter grid search @xcite to ensure a global search for the best fit .",
    "this minimum is indeed a global dynamical best fit assuming coplanar edge - on orbits ; two other local minima with slightly larger @xmath20 have been found . the coplanar edge - on best - fit parameters",
    "are listed in table [ dynfitresults ] , with their error bars determined by the covariance matrix .",
    "this fit and its residuals are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : rv ] .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : rv ] shows that both resonance angles are librating , with amplitudes of @xmath340@xmath0  ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath360@xmath0  ( @xmath10 ) .    assuming the planets are in coplanar orbits",
    ", we then allow the inclination to the sky plane to vary along with other fitting parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : chisq ] shows @xmath19 and rms as a function of @xmath21 , and figure  [ fig : para ] shows best - fit parameters as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath19 curve is shallow in the range of @xmath22 , but then shows a clear local minimum at @xmath23 ( @xmath24@xmath0 ) .",
    "two further local minima were found , at inclinations of @xmath2590@xmath0  and 40.2@xmath0 .",
    "the parameters of these three solutions are given in table  [ dynfitresults ] ; the planetary masses scale accordingly as 1/sin@xmath18 , resulting in more massive planets for the low - inclination solutions .    the @xmath19 curve and fitting parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] ) show discontinuities along the @xmath21 axis , especially those near @xmath26 . to understand these discontinuities ,",
    "we explore grids in different fixed @xmath21 , to see the evolution of the parameter space along different inclinations .",
    "figure  [ fig : k1k2 ] shows @xmath27-@xmath28 grids for different @xmath21 .",
    "initially when the orbits are at @xmath26 , there is only one @xmath19 minimum ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "then a new local minimum ( @xmath30 ) appears around @xmath31 , whose fitting parameters are significantly different from the original minimum ( @xmath32 ) . when @xmath21 drops down to 0.425 , the original minimum vanishes and the new one becomes a single minimum in parameter space .",
    "the appearance of the additional @xmath20 minimum results in the big `` jump '' of fitting parameters at about @xmath33 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : para ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we have four possible configurations for this system ( one keplerian fit and three dynamical fits ) .",
    "the four solutions are not substantially different from one another , apart from the sin  @xmath18 factor for the three solutions in table  [ dynfitresults ] , which serves to increase the planetary masses relative to the keplerian scenario in which we have assumed the planets to be at their minimum masses ( m  sin  @xmath18 ) . as a first - order check of dynamical stability ,",
    "the best - fit system configuration at each inclination was integrated for @xmath34 yr .",
    "for all fits so tested , at inclinations of 26.7 , 30.0 , 33.4 , 36.9 , 40.0 , and 90.0 degrees ( sin@xmath250.45 , 0.5 , 0.55 , 0.6 , 0.64 , 1.0 ) , the systems remained stable for @xmath34 yr .",
    "however , since dynamical stability is highly dependent on the initial conditions , we expand on these tests in the next section to obtain a more robust and complete picture of the stability of the various configurations .",
    "we have found four possible solutions for the hd73526 system , which significantly differ in inclination ( and hence the planetary masses ) .",
    "it is therefore critical to perform dynamical stability tests on these configurations , as the solution with the absolute @xmath19 minimum may prove dynamically unfeasible .",
    "when analyzing any multiple - planet system , it is prudent to investigate the long - term dynamical stability of the system .",
    "as more multi - planet systems are discovered , the announcement of planetary systems which turn out to be dynamically unfeasible has become increasingly common .",
    "detailed n - body simulations can be used to test the veracity of planet claims .",
    "sometimes the results of such tests have shown that some systems simply can not exist in their proposed configuration on astronomically relevant timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other cases , dynamical testing can place additional constraints on planetary systems , particlarly when the planets are in or near resonances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section ,",
    "we examine the various solutions for the hd73526 system , performing detailed dynamical tests of the planetary system configurations as given in tables  [ planetparams ] and [ dynfitresults ] . given that the four solutions are not substantially different from each other in terms of goodness - of - fit , these dynamical stability tests can serve to discern which scenario is most plausible : a solution which is favored by the fitting process may prove to be unstable and hence unfeasible .      as in our previous dynamical work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we used the hybrid integrator within the _",
    "n_-body dynamics package mercury @xcite to perform our integrations .",
    "we held the initial orbit of the inner planet fixed at its best - fit parameters , as given in table  [ planetparams ] , and then created 126,075 test systems . in those test systems , the initial orbit of the outer planet",
    "was varied systematically in semi - major axis @xmath35 , eccentricity @xmath36 , periastron argument @xmath37 , and mean anomaly @xmath38 , resulting in a 41x41x15x5 grid of `` clones '' spaced evenly across the 3@xmath39 range in those parameters .",
    "we assumed the planets were coplanar with each other and , for the keplerian case , we assigned masses equivalent to their minimum mass , @xmath40 ( table  [ planetparams ] ) .",
    "we then followed the dynamical evolution of each test system for a period of 100 million years , and recorded the times at which either of the planets was removed from the system .",
    "planets were removed if they collided with one another , hit the central body , or reached a barycentric distance of 10  au .",
    "we performed these dynamical simulations for the keplerian fit ( @xmath1@xmath0 ) , the dynamical fit at @xmath1@xmath0 , and the lowest - inclination dynamical fit : the configuration given in table  [ dynfitresults ] at @xmath24@xmath0 . for the latter scenario ,",
    "the planet masses were scaled according to the derived system inclination @xmath18 . clearly , the masses of the planets are a proxy for the expected dynamical stability",
    " systems containing more - massive planets are likely to be less stable .",
    "hence , the three scenarios we have tested , at @xmath1@xmath0  and @xmath24@xmath0 , represent the extremes of dynamical stability ( or instability ) for the hd73526 system .    to explore the effects of mutual inclinations between the planets",
    ", we performed five additional n - body simulations , for scenarios in which the two planets were inclined with respect to each other .",
    "these simulations were set up exactly as described above , using the parameters of the keplerian solution ( table  [ planetparams ] ) , except at a lower resolution due to computing limitations : a 21x21x5x5 grid in @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "five runs were performed , at mutual inclinations of 5 , 15 , 45 , 135 , and 180 degrees .",
    "the latter two cases represent retrograde scenarios , which can sometimes allow for a larger range of dynamically stable orbits @xcite .",
    "the results of our dynamical stability simulations for the keplerian solution are shown in figure  [ dynam1 ] .",
    "we show six panels , for the coplanar and five mutually - inclined scenarios as described above . for the coplanar and 5-degree cases ( panels",
    "a and b ) , the best - fit set of parameters ( shown by the open square with 1@xmath39 crosshairs ) lies in a region of moderate stability , with mean system survival times of @xmath41 years .",
    "the stability rapidly degrades as the inclination between the planets becomes significant , and even for retrograde cases ( panels e and f ) , the nominal best - fit system destabilizes within @xmath42 yr . from these simulations , we can conclude that the hd73526 planets are most likely coplanar with each other .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) also show that the stability of the system increases as the outer planet takes on lower eccentricities . for @xmath430.2 ,",
    "mean survival times exceed @xmath17 yr .",
    "this is not a surprising result , as high eccentricities generally increase the possibility of strong interactions or even orbit crossings ( though systems in protected resonances may remain stable for some values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "indeed , the statistics of multi - planet systems show that planets in multiple systems tend to have lower eccentricities @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ dynam1 ] , the keplerian best - fit solution is stable on million - year timescales .",
    "however , the colored squares in figure  [ dynam1 ] represent the _",
    "mean _ survival times across the range of mean anomalies and @xmath37 tested .",
    "as the best - fit solution for the hd73526 system places the planets on resonant orbits , their stability will naturally be highly sensitive to the values of these angles .",
    "hence , figure  [ angles ] shows the outcomes of the 75 individual simulations performed at the best - fit @xmath35 and @xmath36 spanning a 5x15 grid in @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "we see that the nominal solution ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are fixed at the best - fit values ) lies at the point of maximum stability .",
    "while this is reassuringly consistent with our expectations of enhanced stability within the resonance , we caution that each colored square in figure  [ angles ] represents only a single run , and dynamical evolution is known to be a chaotic process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the long - term stability results for the dynamical fit with @xmath1@xmath0  are shown in figure  [ dynam3 ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent that this solution results in a higher degree of stability , with the entire one - sigma region exhibiting mean lifetimes exceeding @xmath17yr .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ dynam3 ] shows the results from the 75 individual runs in the central best - fit square , as in figure  [ angles ] . for this case ,",
    "when we examine the dependence on @xmath38 and @xmath37 , we see that the entire diagonal region ( including the best fit ) is stable for @xmath34 years .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ dynam2 ] shows the dynamical stability of the @xmath24@xmath0  solution from table  [ dynfitresults ] . though this fit is formally almost as good as the keplerian fit , the increased masses implied by the inclination render the system unstable on short timescales ( 1000 yr ) .",
    "we have fit the hd73526 system using both kinematic and dynamical techniques , yielding four possible solutions .",
    "there are no compelling differences between the four models in terms of their goodness - of - fit statistics or derived planetary parameters .",
    "the only significant distinguishing characteristics are the planet masses derived from the system inclinations in the dynamical fits ( table  [ dynfitresults ] ) .",
    "we thus turned to a detailed dynamical stability mapping procedure in which we tested a broad range of parameters about the best - fit solutions .",
    "our dynamical stability testing showed that the keplerian model yielded a system which was stable on million - year time scales , with stability increasing for lower eccentricities ( figure  [ dynam1 ] ) .",
    "the interacting dynamical fitting procedure gave three `` best '' solutions , one of which was at a system inclination of 90@xmath0  ( giving planet masses equal to the m sin @xmath18 minimum masses used in the keplerian model ) .",
    "our stability testing for the inclined solution at @xmath24@xmath0  resulted in severe instability throughout the allowed 3@xmath39 parameter space .",
    "the increased planetary masses for the low - inclination solutions appear to destabilize the system on astronomically short timescales ( @xmath441000 yr ) .",
    "this result leads us to reject the @xmath24@xmath0  scenario . while the individual best - fit solutions proved stable for @xmath45@xmath0(as",
    "noted in section 3.2 ) , it is clear that the region of long - term stability expands as the system inclination increases .",
    "we thus adopt the @xmath1@xmath0  dynamical fit for two primary reasons : first , the planets are massive enough that they are certainly interacting with each other , as evidenced by the 2:1 resonant configuration ; and second , this fit proved to be significantly more stable than the keplerian fit ( figure  [ dynam1 ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that if the system s inclination is indeed near 90@xmath0 , there is the possibility that one or both planets transit .",
    "this work has shown how dynamical stability considerations can serve to constrain the configuration of a planetary system when the @xmath19 surface is such that a clear minimum is not evident ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have combined two fitting methods with the detailed dynamical simulations to present an updated view of the interesting 2:1 resonant planetary system orbiting hd73526 .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system ( ads ) , and the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
