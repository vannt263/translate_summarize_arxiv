    "recently , essential progress in fabrication and determination of optical properties of different kinds of microcavities with sizes about @xmath0 which contain semiconductor nanoclusters or quantum dots ( qds ) has been achieved [ see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ] . when semiconductor qds are embedded in a spherical microcavity",
    ", the qd luminescence can be coupled with eigen modes of the electromagnetic field of the microcavity and a lower threshold of stimulated emission ( or lasing modes ) of qds can be achieved . in recent papers",
    "artemyev:2000a,@xcite,@xcite a coupling between the optical emission of embedded @xmath1 , qds and spherical cavity modes was studied and a strong whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonance with high @xmath2 factors is registered in the photoluminescence spectra .",
    "recently @xcite quantum - confined semiconductor nanorods were used as highly polarized nanoemitters for active control of the polarization state of microcavity photons .    until now the modes with small numbers of spherical harmonics ( snm )",
    "are essentially less well - studied compared with whispering gallery modes ( wgm ) due to their rather low @xmath2-factor caused by significant radiating losses .",
    "a possibility of strongly increasing the @xmath2-factor of the microsphere was proposed in several papers , see e.g. @xcite , sullivan:1994a , @xcite .",
    "the main idea consists in coating a microsphere by alternative layers of a spherical stack , which results in an increase of the @xmath2 factor up to values comparable for wgm , i.e. @xmath3 .    in a system with small mean photon number two spatially separated atoms in a cavity become entangled at some time moments as a result of sharing the re - radiated photons @xcite , @xcite , cirac:1994a , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of these schemes has been realized using rydberg atoms coupled one by one to a high @xmath4 microwave superconducting microcavity @xcite . in inhomogeneous structures , like multilayered microspheres ,",
    "the quantized field properties are quite different from the unbounded case because of a non - uniformity of the cavity field , which becomes important for the entanglement dynamics . in spite of numerous experimental obstacles , mainly related with the decoherence problem",
    ", it seems very natural to entangle atoms placed in high-@xmath2 cavities ( like microspheres ) via interaction with modes of the cavity quantized field .",
    "a simple scheme for the generation of two - atom maximally entangled states via dispersive interaction was proposed in @xcite .",

    "ii we discuss basic equations for two atoms placed into a coated microsphere and the solution for this case . in section iii we present an analytical solution for probability amplitudes and apply it to studying the atomic concurrence . in section iv we present a numerical study of the concurrence ( tangle ) dynamics . in the last section ,",

    "it is easy to see , that such oscillations have the rabi frequency and are related to the instantaneous average number  of photons ( dashed line in fig.pic_fig1_c2 ) stored in the field .",

    "the particular situation described by the simplified model ( [ simplesolc123 ] ) is presented in the same fig.pic_c01_04_075 as the dashed line . from fig.[pic_c01_04_075 ] one can observe that if ( [ g*g = gg ] ) is fulfilled the amplitude of the fast oscillations is much less than in the general case , and therefore can be regarded as the optimal dynamics .    for the far detuned case @xmath121 one can easily obtain from ( [ simplesolc123 ] ) two well separated frequency components of @xmath102:the high frequency component @xmath122 and the low frequency component @xmath123 .",

    "in general @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "this means that in the resonant case , @xmath148 , the two - atom system can be maximally entangled if @xmath149  , i.e. when the atoms have different field - atom coupling constants , @xmath150 . nevertheless in the general case , when @xmath151  , the structure of the concurrence @xmath152 is more complicated .",
    "the structure @xmath153 was calculated for @xmath154 , @xmath115 ( initially excited atom is placed in a smaller field ) and @xmath155 .",
    "we observe that the surface @xmath156 is rather asymmetrical with respect to the line @xmath157 . in the course of evolution for fixed @xmath158 the maximal values of @xmath153 move out from the origin of coordinates . obviously on the edges where @xmath159 , the concurrence vanishes , @xmath160 . in the vicinity of maxima",
    "the concurrence @xmath153 is highly asymmetric .",
    "for @xmath161 the maxima @xmath153 in the left side are smoother and the hills are more pronounced .",
    "this means that the system remains in the region of strong entanglement for long periods if @xmath161 .",
    "however in general , the details of the surface @xmath156 essentially depend on @xmath162 and the form of the green s function .",
    "it is worth noting , that in a real microsphere the field dissipation is caused by material losses and the radiation into surrounding space leads to line broadening ( bandwidth ) .",
    "the analytical calculation of such a broadening requires an extensive knowledge of the microscopical local field , which in a multilayered microsphere case is itself a quite difficult problem .",
    "to estimate the influence of the dissipation on the concurrence dynamics we will use the following simplified approach . although we do not know the exact frequency dependence of the dissipative part on the refractive indices of the materials @xmath163 in a microsphere , it is possible to calculate the spectral width of the green function peak . _",
    "_  _ _ thus , we can estimate the effect of the field s dissipation using the master equation technique in the framework of the lingblad approach .",
    "in particular , the dissipation coefficients are calculated from the bandwidth of the green function peak _ _  _ _ ( see fig.[pic_fig2_fr ] ) .",
    "such a semi - analytical approach allows us to simulate numerically not only the evolution of the concurrence in a lossy environment , but also the dynamics of the average photon number . in this approach",
    "we replace the exact hamiltonian ( [ general h ] ) by the simplified hamiltonian ( [ simple h ] ) and numerically solve the following master equation for the joint atom - field density operator @xmath164 in a dissipative cavity at zero temperature :    @xmath165+l_{1}\\rho\\text { , }   \\label{neiman eq } \\\\",
    "l_{1}\\rho & = \\gamma_{1}\\left ( 2a\\rho a^{+}-a^{+}a\\rho-\\rho a^{+}a\\right )   \\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath166 is given by ( [ simple h ] ) , and in ( [ neiman eq ] ) we neglect the atomic spontaneous emission in the rabi period time scale .",
    "also we have used the detuning @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 . in fig.[pic_fig1_c2diss ] the dynamics of the two - atom tangle @xmath114 for the lossy case is shown .",
    "it is clear from fig.[pic_fig1_c2diss ] that the plateaus of concurrence survive even in the presence of dissipation , although their amplitude is obviously lower than in the lossless case .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of entanglement of spatially separated two - level atoms interacting with a radially nonuniform cavity field mode in a dielectric microsphere coated with an alternating stack .",
    "we found that due to the field inhomogeneity the atoms can be maximally entangled even in the resonant case .",
    "we have found that entanglement essentially depends on the atomic positions ( asymmetrical entanglement ) and also on the detuning between atoms and the field mode frequencies .",
    "the entanglement is considerably more stable with duration much longer than the period of rabi oscillations ( robust entanglement ) when the unexcited atom is placed in a stronger field , while the detuning increases the duration of the entanglement period .",
    "the dissipation reduces the amplitude of the entanglement , however practically does not change the width of the zones of large entanglement .",
