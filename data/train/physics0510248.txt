    "in this paper we turn upon the seminal harris and todaro @xcite work , which together with todaro @xcite is considered one of the starting points of the classic rural - urban migration theory @xcite . the hypothesis and predictions of harris - todaro model",
    "have been subjected to econometric evaluation and have been corroborated by several studies @xcite .",
    "the key hypothesis of harris and todaro are that migrants react mainly to economic incentives , earnings differentials , and the probability of getting a job at the destination have influence on the migraton decision . in other words , these authors posit that rural - urban migration will occur while the urban expected wage exceed the rural wage . from this _ crucial assumption _ , as denominated by harris - todaro @xcite , is deduced that the migratory dynamics leads the economic system toward an equilibrium with urban concentration and high urban unemployment .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we analyzed the rural - urban migration by means of an agent - based computational model taking into account the influence of the neighborhood in the migration decision .",
    "the inclusion of the influence of neighbors was done via an ising like model .",
    "the economic analogous to the external field in the ising hamiltonian was the differential of expected wages between urban and rural sectors .",
    "therefore , in theses works @xcite the crucial assumption of harris and todaro were taken for granted .",
    "now , we are motivated by the following question : can the crucial assumption and equilibrium with urban concentration and urban unemployment obtained from the original harris - todaro model be generated as emergent properties from the interaction among adaptative agents ? in order to answer this question we implemented an agent - based computational model in which workers grope for best sectorial location over time in terms of earnings .",
    "the economic system simulated is characterized by the assumption originally made by harris and todaro .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ haristodaromodel ] describes the analytical harris - todaro model showing its basic equilibrium properties . in section [ harristodaroagentbasedmodel ]",
    "we present the implementation of the computational model via an agent - based simulation and compare its aggregate regularities with the analytical equilibrium properties .",
    "section [ conclusion ] shows concluding remarks .",
    "harris and todaro @xcite studied the migration of workers in a two - sector economic system , namely , rural sector and urban sector .",
    "the difference between these sectors are the type of goods produced , the technology of production and the process of wage determination .",
    "the rural sector is specialized in the production of agricultural goods .",
    "the productive process of this sector can be described by a cobb - douglas production function :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the production level of the agricultural good , @xmath2 is the amount of workers used in the agricultural production , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parametric constants .",
    "similarly , the urban sector also has its productive process described as cobb - douglas production function : , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . except where it is indicated , the results presented in this section are valid for this general case . the cobb - douglas form is a standard assumption about technology . ]",
    "@xmath8    where @xmath9 is the production level of the manufactured good , @xmath10 is the quantity of workers employed in the production of manufactured goods , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are parametric constants .",
    "both goods and labor markets are perfectly competitive .",
    "nevertheless , there is segmentation in the labor market due to a high minimum urban wage politically determined .    in the rural sector ,",
    "the real wage , perfectly flexible , is equal to the marginal productivity of labor in this sector : ) , with respect to @xmath2 multiplied by @xmath13 . ]",
    "@xmath14    where @xmath15 is the real wage and @xmath13 is the price of the agricultural good , both expressed in units of manufactured good .    in the urban sector , a minimum wage , @xmath16 , is assumed fixed institutionally at a level above equilibrium in this labor market .",
    "it can be formalized as ) , with respect to @xmath10 . ]",
    "@xmath17    where @xmath18 is the amount of workers in the urban sector .",
    "the relative price of the agricultural good in terms of the manufactured good , @xmath13 , varies according to the relative scarcity between agricultural and manufacturated goods . then , denotes a function in their work not a constant value as used by us . ]",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are a parametric constants .",
    "@xmath22 is the elasticity of @xmath13 with respect to the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "the overall population of workers in the economy is @xmath24 , which is kept constant during the whole period of analysis . by assumption",
    "there are only two sectors and rural prices are wholly flexible , which implies that there is full employment in the rural area , i.e. , all workers living at the rural sector are employed at any period . then at any period",
    "the following equality is verified :    @xmath25      given a parametric constant vector @xmath26 , an initial urban population @xmath18 , and a minimum wage @xmath16 one can calculate the temporary equilibrium of the economic system by using eqs .",

    "harris and todaro , in determining the long run equilibrium , i.e. , the absence of a net rural - urban migratory flow , argue that the rural workers , in their decision on migrating to the urban area , estimate the expected urban wage , @xmath34 , defined as :    @xmath35    the ratio @xmath36 , which is the employment rate , is an estimative of the probability that a worker living at urban sector gets a job in this sector .",
    "as mentioned before , the key assumption of the model of harris and todaro is that there will be a migratory flow from the rural to the urban sector while the expected urban wage is higher than the rural wage .",
    "thus , the long run equilibrium is attained when the urban worker population reaches a level such that the expected urban wage equates the rural wage :    @xmath37    this equality is known in the economic literature as the _ harris - todaro condition_. harris and todaro argue that the differential of expected wages in eq .",
    "( [ wuwa ] ) can be a constant value @xmath38 . when this differential reaches @xmath39 , the net migration ceases .",

    "( [ wuwadelta ] ) , i.e. , the equilibrium urban share @xmath41 , is determined from the solution of the equation resulting from substitution of equations ( [ wafunc ] ) , ( [ wu ] ) in eq .",

    "( [ geneq ] ) is parametrized by the vector @xmath44 .",
    "harris and todaro @xcite , in order to evaluate the stability of the long run equilibrium , postulate a mechanism of adjustment that is based on the following function of sign preservation :    @xmath45    the differential equation that governs the state transition in the model of harris and todaro is obtained by replacing equations ( [ wafunc ] ) , ( [ wu ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ dndt ] ) . based on this postulated adjustment process , harris and todaro @xcite show that the long run equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "this means that the economy would tend to long run equilibrium with unemployment in the urban sector generated by the presence of a relatively high minimum wage for all possible initial conditions . from now on we will refer to the long run equilibrium simply as equilibrium .    ) for different values of @xmath16 .",

    "( [ geneq ] ) one can evaluate the impact that the variation of the minimum wage and the elasticity of the terms of trade on the equilibrium . in figure [ nuwmn ]",
    "we see that under the hypothesis of a cobb - douglas technology , the equilibrium urban share , @xmath46 , does not depend on the minimum wage @xmath16 .",

    ". the greater @xmath22 the greater this shift , what cause an increase in the rural wage in units of manufacturing good , becoming the urban sector less attractive .",
    "in this section we describe the implementation of the computational model we proposed , as well as the aggregate patterns obtained numerically and the comparison with the respective analytical results .",
    "initially , workers are randomly placed in a square lattice with linear dimension @xmath56 .",
    "the reference values of the parameters used for these simulations are the same done to evaluate the equilibrium of the harris - todaro model , namely , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the value of the minimum wage used is @xmath55 and the initial urban fraction of the total population is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the normalized urban population also called urban share .",
    "the initial value @xmath57 is in agreement with historical data of developing economies . given these parameters , one can calculate the vector which characterizes temporary equilibrium of the system by using eqs .",

    "( [ nm ] ) , the employment level of the urban sector , @xmath10 , is obtained . if @xmath59 all workers in the urban sector are employed and each individual @xmath60 earns the wage given by the manufacturing marginal productivity , @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath62 there will be a fraction of @xmath36 workers employed , which earn the minimum wage , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 workers unemployed , which earn a wage @xmath65 .",
    "each worker can be selected to review his sectorial location with probability @xmath66 , called activity @xcite .",
    "therefore , in each time step only a fraction of workers becomes potential migrants , going through the sectorial location reviewing process .",
    "potential migrants will determine their satisfaction level of being in the current sector by comparing their earnings , @xmath67 , among nearest neighbors .",
    "the potential migrant starts the comparison process with a initial satisfaction level @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 the satisfaction level @xmath70 is added in one unit ; if @xmath71 , @xmath70 is diminished in one unit ; if @xmath72 , @xmath70 does not change .",
    "after the worker has passed through the reviewing process his / her satisfaction level is checked .",
    "the migration will occur only if @xmath73 , what means that the worker s",
    "@xmath60 earnings is less than the most of his / her nearest neighbors .",
    "after all the potential migrants complete the reviewing process and have decided migrate or not , a new configuration of the system is set . therefore , once again a new temporary equilibrium of the system is calculated by using eqs .",

    "figure [ nut ] also shows that even after the urban share has reached an stable average value , there are small fluctuations around this average .",
