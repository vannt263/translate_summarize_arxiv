    "<S> this bound was obtained by considering the scattering process @xmath4 [ @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes longitudinal polarization ( helicity zero ) ] in the absence of a higgs boson . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath12 @xcite , and @xmath13 @xcite colliders , in much the same way that @xmath14 ( obtained from the consideration of @xmath15 in the absence of a higgs boson @xcite ) serves as the benchmark for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) was already questioned in the original paper of appelquist and chanowitz . in the standard higgs model , </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson is responsible for fermion mass generation , yet its mass can not exceed approximately 800 gev @xcite , well below the bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) for all known fermions . in extended technicolor ( etc ) models </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the scale of fermion mass generation is the mass of the etc gauge boson @xmath16 which scales with @xmath0 differently from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) , and is much less than @xmath7 for all known fermions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the process @xmath4 ceases to grow with energy at an energy of order @xmath17 rather than @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several years later , golden @xcite revisited the issue of the relevance of the bound in models with a higgs boson , and found a bound which scales with @xmath0 like eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ etc ] ) rather than eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the relevance of the bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) remains an open and important question .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we study the scale of fermion mass generation in the context of a two - higgs - doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> we imagine that the higgs scalar responsible for unitarizing @xmath15 is `` light , '' and we derive an upper bound on the mass of the heavy higgs scalar which is responsible for unitarizing @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if all dimensionless higgs self - couplings are kept fixed , the bound on the mass of the heavy higgs scalar scales with @xmath0 like eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ etc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if some of the dimensionless higgs self - couplings are allowed to grow with the mass of the heavy higgs scalar , the bound on the mass of this higgs scalar is instead given by the appelquist - chanowitz bound , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) .    before we begin our analysis , let us recall the meaning of unitarity bounds in effective field theories @xcite . in the absence of a higgs boson , a perturbative calculation of the scattering amplitude for @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> yields an expansion in powers of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion becomes useless once the expansion parameter is of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> one can use unitarity to estimate this energy @xcite , which yields @xmath22 ( eq .  ( [ ewsb ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of a `` light '' higgs boson to the theory changes the expansion parameter to @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) ; one says that the higgs boson `` unitarizes '' the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the largest higgs mass allowed is approximately 800 gev @xcite , which nearly saturates the bound @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> now add a massive fermion of mass @xmath0 to the theory , again in the absence of a higgs boson . in processes involving the massive fermion </S>",
    "<S> , one finds an additional expansion parameter , @xmath25 , along with the expansion parameter @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> again , unitarity can be used to estimate the energy at which this additional expansion parameter is of order unity , and the result is @xmath26 ( eq .  ( [ f ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the appelquist - chanowitz bound is supported by the analysis of one - loop diagrams in section 2 of golden @xcite .    whatever physics unitarizes @xmath20 need not necessarily unitarize @xmath19 . in the standard higgs model , </S>",
    "<S> the same higgs boson is responsible for unitarizing both processes . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider a two - higgs - doublet model , with only one higgs field coupled to a given fermion . </S>",
    "<S> this can be arranged by imposing a discrete symmetry @xmath27 on one of the higgs fields , such that only the higgs field @xmath28 has yukawa couplings to a given fermion @xcite . to the higgs field @xmath29 by letting @xmath30 under the discrete symmetry . ] </S>",

    "<S> our analysis of the model closely follows that of haber @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the relevant feynman rules for the higgs scalars are listed in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> since we want the light higgs scalar @xmath32 to ( almost completely ) unitarize @xmath20 , we want its coupling to vector bosons to be close to the standard - model value . </S>",

    "<S> the diagrams have a value equal to the same diagram in the standard higgs model , times the factor shown to the right of each diagram . since we are interested in the limit @xmath47 , the only way that the diagram involving the heavy higgs scalar @xmath33 can contribute significantly to the unitarization of @xmath4 is if @xmath48 or equivalently , since @xmath49 , @xmath50 this corresponds to a strong yukawa coupling of the heavy higgs scalar to the fermion ( see fig .  1 ) , </S>",

    "<S> ( 4.6,2 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 2.3,1.45 ) ( 2.3,0.45 )    to proceed further , we must introduce an additional piece of physics . recall that the upper bound on the higgs mass arises from the condition that it be less than the cutoff of the theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this condition turns out to be equivalent to the condition that the ( running ) higgs self - interaction remain perturbative below the cutoff @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the yukawa coupling of a fermion must remain perturbative below the cutoff @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this puts an upper bound on the yukawa coupling , which can be estimated from the unitarity of @xmath52 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath53 combining eqs .  ( [ beta ] ) and ( [ yuk ] ) gives @xmath54 this is a constraint on how small @xmath55 can be , and still have the heavy higgs scalar @xmath33 contribute significantly to the unitarization of @xmath4 .    to convert eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cos0 ] ) into an upper bound on the mass of the heavy higgs scalar @xmath33 , we must consider how @xmath55 scales with @xmath56 . </S>",

    "<S> this is an example of a model in which the scale of fermion mass generation scales with @xmath0 as in extended technicolor , yet the process @xmath4 is unitarized at the scale of fermion mass generation , @xmath56 , rather than at @xmath17 , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> however , since _ all _ the dimensionless higgs self - couplings ( including @xmath71 ) may be restricted to be perturbative , it is not clear how to interpret this model .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath55 has a lower bound given by eq .  </S>",
