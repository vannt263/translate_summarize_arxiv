    "in spite of its remarkable phenomenological success there are several aspects of the standard model that remain unexplained .",
    "two of them are the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of @xmath2 violation .",
    "a broad class of models in which the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically by new strong interactions does not contain any new particles sufficiently light to be produced at a 500  gev @xmath1 collider .",
    "new particles in these models have masses in the tev range and only manifest themselves indirectly in experiments at lower energies .",
    "in general these models may violate @xmath2 and this would also manifest itself indirectly at low energy .",
    "it is convenient to describe the phenomenology of the most important features of this type of new physics in a model independent way .",
    "this is accomplished by studying a low energy ( below a few tev ) effective lagrangian that contains only the standard model fields and where the effect of the new physics appears as higher dimension operators .",
    "these higher dimension operators modify the couplings of the observed particles , inducing `` anomalous couplings '' whose phenomenology has been studied in detail @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of the lowest dimension operators that violate @xmath2 in the gauge - boson self - couplings . in",
    "has become standard to parameterize the three gauge boson coupling @xmath16 following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath17 in writing this equation we have already dropped terms proportional to @xmath18 because they are of higher dimension .",
    "the overall normalization is @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "electro - magnetic gauge invariance forbids the term @xmath21",
    "so we are left with three new @xmath2 violating parameters .",
    "one of them , @xmath22 , violates @xmath23 and conserves @xmath24 ; whereas the other two , @xmath25 and @xmath26 violate @xmath24 and conserve @xmath23 .",
    "the next to leading order electroweak chiral lagrangian @xcite contains three @xmath2 violating operators whose couplings correspond to the lowest dimension contributions to the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ haginot ] ) .",
    "they are @xcite :    @xmath27    where we have used the notation of ref .",
    "the relation between these couplings and those in eq .",
    "( [ haginot ] ) is @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we do not wish to reproduce here all the details of the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is sufficient to remind the reader that the factor @xmath31 that appears in all three operators constitutes an explicit breaking of custodial symmetry .",
    "this implies that if the new physics violates @xmath2 maximally ( i.e. without suppressions from dimensionless parameters such as mixing angles ) , the natural size of the coefficients is that of @xmath32 .",
    "these are the same arguments that give the natural size of the lowest dimension parity violating coupling @xcite . with @xmath33  gev and the scale of new physics @xmath34 a few tev we thus expect @xmath35 if the symmetry breaking sector has a custodial symmetry to explain the smallness of @xmath36 . in ref .",
    "@xcite appelquist and wu discuss a specific model in which they estimate that the coefficients @xmath37 are indeed of order @xmath38 and correlated with @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath36 is small accidentally , naive power counting tells us that these couplings could be at the few percent level , @xmath39 .",
    "these numbers will help us calibrate the significance of the constraints that we discuss .",
    "the best indirect bound that exists on any of these couplings is @xmath40 , which arises from the neutron e.d.m .",
    "this is a very tight constraint , but it is subject to naturalness assumptions . as usual , it is not a substitute for a direct constraint .",
    "previous studies of @xmath41 production at an upgraded tevatron have concluded that it will be possible to place the constraint @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this is of the same order as the bound that we find in this study for the 500  gev @xmath1 collider , but a precise comparison is not possible without further knowledge of the experimental setups .",
    "there have been previous studies of the @xmath2 violating anomalous couplings in the process @xmath43 @xcite , but a detailed numerical analysis of the bounds that one can get at a nlc has not been done .",
    "the process @xmath44 has also been recently considered @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find that one could place the bound @xmath45 by studying a forward - backward asymmetry with @xmath46 .",
    "we start with the process @xmath47 at a center of mass energy of 500  gev without considering any specific decay channel for the @xmath48  bosons . at this stage",
    "we also ignore the @xmath2 violating nature of the couplings @xmath49 and look only at the quadratic effects that they induce in the decay distribution .",
    "it is possible to study truly @xmath2-violating effects that are linear in the couplings in one of two ways .",
    "we could include absorptive phases in the form factors associated with eq .",
    "( [ haginot ] ) @xcite .",
    "if these phases arise from the same sector responsible for the anomalous couplings then they do not introduce additional suppression factors .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in the model of ref .",
    "alternatively , we could construct a @xmath2 odd observable involving the polarization vectors of the @xmath48 bosons .",
    "this is equivalent to studying correlations that involve the momenta of the decay products of the @xmath48-bosons to a specific channel .",
    "we take the second approach in the following section .    in this section",
    "we consider the @xmath48  bosons to be final state particles and take into account the efficiency for @xmath50 pair reconstruction @xmath51 @xcite in our numerical simulation . because we are ignoring , for now , the @xmath2 violating nature of the couplings , it is possible to bound them using the same @xmath2 even observables that we studied in ref .",
    "the only difference between the @xmath2 violating couplings that we study here , and the @xmath2 conserving couplings that we studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath2 violating couplings always appear quadratically in the @xmath2 even distributions used to place the bounds .",
    "we use the same assumptions about systematic uncertainties and the same analysis of the differential distribution that we described in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use a systematic error @xmath521.5% .",
    "this number arises from an uncertainty in the luminosity measurement of @xmath530.5% , an error in the acceptance @xmath531% , an error for background subtraction @xmath530.5% and a systematic error in the knowledge of the branching ratio @xmath530.5% . from a @xmath54 analysis of @xmath55 with 5 bins , we find the 95% confidence level bounds ( taking only one non - zero coupling at a time ) :",
    "@xmath56 the best bounds for this process are obtained using four bins , as discussed in ref .",
    ". however , the bounds we obtain using five bins are indistinguishable from those for four bins .",
    "we prefer five bins because this will be the optimal number for @xmath57 and using the same number of bins in both cases will facilitate a comparison .",
    "= 2.0 in = 2.0 in    = 2.0 in    in figure  [ f : wwtwo ] we present the allowed 95% confidence level regions when we take one of the @xmath2 violating couplings to be zero .",
    "we see that the bounds are indeed similar to those that can be placed at an upgraded tevatron @xcite , and of the same order as the bounds that we found for @xmath2 conserving anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "the fact that we obtain similar bounds for couplings that contribute linearly to the differential cross - section and for couplings that only contribute quadratically , already indicates that this process is not sensitive to the very small values predicted by naive dimensional analysis .",
    "we now wish to consider a specific channel for the decay of the @xmath48-bosons so that we can construct correlations that could single out @xmath2-violating interactions . with this in mind ,",
    "we need a final state that is easy to identify and that transforms into itself under @xmath2 .",
    "we thus choose to identify the @xmath48 pairs by their @xmath59 leptonic decays .",
    "we calculate the amplitudes for the process @xmath60 and generate events for the three following subprocesses : @xmath61 these subprocesses include 20 , 21 and 11 feynman diagrams respectively .",
    "the last one does not contain anomalous vertices , and constitutes pure background .",
    "sufficient events are generated with our monte - carlo to achieve a @xmath62 statistical error in the value of the cross - section .",
    "we first generate events with a cut on the muon scattering angle and on the muon pair invariant mass : @xmath63 the angle @xmath64 is the scattering angle between the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 momenta in the @xmath1 center of mass frame . to study @xmath2",
    "odd observables we need to make sure that our cuts are `` @xmath2 blind '' , so the same cut is imposed on the angle between the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 momenta .",
    "these cuts are similar to the ones used by the lep experiments .. we assume that the experiments at a nlc will have a similar geometry so we use the same cut .",
    "the cut on the invariant mass of @xmath69 pair , @xmath70 gev serves to reject dalitz conversion of soft photons and to insure good angular separation of the muons .",
    "] after imposing these cuts we assume a muon reconstruction efficiency equal to 1 .",
    "the total cross - section for the @xmath60 process with these cuts is 7.65 fb , which results ( with an integrated luminosity of 50 fb@xmath3 ) in only 382 events .",
    "the resulting bounds will be limited by the small statistics so we will have to relax these cuts later on .",
    "we start by placing bounds on the @xmath2 violating anomalous couplings using the following observables : @xmath71 where @xmath64 is again the scattering angle between the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 momenta in the @xmath72 center of mass frame ; @xmath73 is the muon three - momentum in the same frame , and @xmath74 is proportional to the @xmath31-odd correlation @xmath75 $ ] .",

    "if the polarization of the final leptons is not observed , and the beams are not polarized , this correlation serves to analyze the @xmath2 properties of the interaction @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 even interactions give rise to symmetric distributions ( symmetric about the point @xmath79 ) in @xmath74 , whereas @xmath2 odd interactions give rise to antisymmetric distributions in @xmath74 .",
    "the antisymmetric distributions in this correlation will arise from interference between standard model amplitudes and the new @xmath2-violating physics and will be linear in the new couplings .",
    "notice that the correlation @xmath74 is also odd under parity .",
    "this means that we will get terms proportional to @xmath80 from interference with the parity even standard model amplitude and a term proportional to @xmath22 from interference with the parity odd standard model amplitude .    in figure",
    "[ f : smdist ] we show the differential cross - section predicted by the standard model at lowest order , as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath73 , for @xmath82  gev . from these figures",
    "we see that the events predicted by the standard model are concentrated at small scattering angles and low muon momentum .",
    "similarly we find that the standard model events have a symmetric distribution in @xmath74 ( as corresponds to cp conservation ) that is very strongly peaked at @xmath79 .",
