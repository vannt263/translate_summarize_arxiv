    "it is well known that a directed stationary flow of particles in a system can be created by unbiased external forces . in general",
    "this possibility arises when the system is not invariant under reflections in real space .",
    "this fact is mainly independent of the mechanics which underpins the particle motion , classical or quantum .",
    "however , the microscopic origin of this effect , conventionally called the ratchet effect , is different in the classical and quantum case .",
    "one principle source of that difference is quantum mechanical tunnelling which does not have analogs in the classical mechanics .",
    "correspondingly , one usually distinguishes between classical and quantum ratchet effects . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the latter one in a dissipative system .",
    "such dissipative ratchet systems act as brownian motors @xcite turning brownian into directed motion .",
    "the existence of the ratchet effect in a quantum dissipative one - dimensional ( 1d ) system which lacks the spatial symmetry has been first theoretically predicted in ref .  .",
    "later , within a tight - binding model where the lowest bands are narrow , it has been disclosed that a ratchet state of the particle transport can only be achieved when at least the two lowest bloch bands contribute to transport @xcite . to obtain the ratchet effect in systems with weak periodic potentials at least two harmonics of the potential",
    "should enter the dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "rectification can also take place in a single - band tight - binding model where the spatial asymmetry is concealed from the electron dynamics .",
    "one way to achieve this is to use unbiased external forces with harmonic mixing@xcite .    coherent charge ratchets based on molecular wires with an asymmetric level structure of the orbital energies were proposed in ref .  .",
    "in this case weak dissipation originates from a weak coupling between the wire edges and leads which represent fermionic reservoirs .",
    "in contrast to the systems described above in this system there is no dissipation in the wire . the ratchet effect is a result of the dissipative coupling of the wire to fermionic baths .    in a different branch of condensed matter",
    "a new research field has emerged during the last decade , namely spintronics , where one tries to make use of the spin degree of freedom of a particle instead of only the charge one .",
    "one essential difference between spin and charge is that a particle can have more than one spin state while it has only one charge state . in the context of transport",
    "it is important that the spin state of a particle can strongly depend on the transport conditions , in particular on the transport direction , as it happens for example in systems with spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this fact has founded a new arena for different spin devices used to store , transform and transfer miscellaneous information .",
    "the possibility to transfer the spin separately from charge plays an important role .",
    "this can be implemented by so - called pure spin currents , that is spin currents which are not accompanied by charge currents .",
    "thus the generation of such currents has been extensively discussed . among different mechanisms of spin - orbit interaction",
    "rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) @xcite plays a distinguished role because it provides an opportunity to control the spin - orbit coupling strength by an external electric field .",
    "the change in the band structure spawned by the spin - orbit interaction leads to one of the most remarkable effects in spintronics , the intrinsic spin - hall effect , first predicted by murakami _",
    "et al._@xcite for hole - doped semiconductors with the spin - orbit interaction of the effective luttinger model for holes and later by sinova _",
    "et al._@xcite in a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rsoi .",
    "the spin current which results from the intrinsic spin - hall effect is pure and its experimental detection was discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ , by wunderlich _ et al._@xcite another kind of spin - hall effect , the extrinsic spin - hall effect , is a result of the spin - orbit interaction as well .",
    "the spin currents related to the extrinsic spin - hall effect are also pure .",
    "such pure spin currents were experimentally detected through optical measuring of electron spin accumulation at the edges of the samples@xcite and through the reciprocal spin - hall effect @xcite in ref .  .",
    "another approach to create pure spin currents is to use polarized light .",
    "for example in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors one - photon absorption of linearly polarized light induces pure spin currents @xcite . the pure spin current response to linearly and circularly polarized light irradiation , exciting electrons from valence bands into the conduction bands , was studied by li _ et al._@xcite and by zhou _",
    "et al._@xcite for 2degs with rsoi .",
    "an alternative technique of getting pure spin currents is quantum spin pumping .",
    "the idea of quantum spin pumping comes from the general idea of electron pumping @xcite .",
    "electron pumping assumes that in a given system any voltage bias is absent and the particle flow is a result of a cyclic variation of at least two parameters of this system . when the electron spin is involved due to some mechanisms ,",
    "various quantum spin pumps emerge .",
    "for example spin pumps based on electronic interactions @xcite , magnetic barriers @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite have been discussed . a spin pump based on a quantum dot",
    "was experimentally implemented by watson _",
    "et al._@xcite the pure spin current generation using the spin ratchet effect in coherent and dissipative systems with rsoi was investigated in refs .   and , respectively . the spin ratchet effect in the presence of a non - uniform static magnetic field without spin - orbit interaction , the zeeman ratchet effect ,",
    "was studied in ref .   for coherent quantum wires formed in a 2deg .",
    "however , the spin ratchet effect in a dissipative system in an external magnetic field has not been considered up to now .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results of ref .   to include a transverse in - plane uniform stationary magnetic field . specifically , we consider non - interacting electrons in a quantum wire formed by a harmonic transverse confinement in a 2deg with rsoi .",
    "the electrons are also subject to a 1d periodic potential along the wire direction and the in - plane magnetic field perpendicular to the wire .",
    "an orbital coupling between this originally isolated system and an external environment causes dissipative processes affecting indirectly the spin dynamics through rsoi .",
    "an external ac driving originates in our work from an applied ac electric field .",
    "we show that for such a driving the net stationary charge current is strongly suppressed if the transport is governed only by electrons of the bloch sub - bands related to the same bloch band which would result from the corresponding truly 1d problem without rsoi . however , at the same time and under the same conditions a net stationary spin current turns out to be activated in a spatially asymmetric situation and for finite values of the spin - orbit coupling strength and the coupling strength between the orbital degrees of freedom",
    ". the magnetic field does not destroy this picture , but it can partly reduce or on the contrary enhance the ratchet effect .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formulation ]",
    "we describe a model within which a ratchet like behavior of the spin transport can be achieved and present a master equation in terms of populations and transition rates between the basis states used to calculate the charge and spin currents .",
    "these basis states are then thoroughly discussed in section [ diag_sigma_x ] .",
    "a tight - binding model is formulated in section [ sigma_dvr_tb_model ] . in section [ transition_rates ]",
    "we present the transition rates and their properties .",
    "finally , in section [ currents ] we derive _ analytical _ expressions for the charge and spin currents and explore the spin ratchet effect in the system .",
    "the full hamiltonian of our problem is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the isolated periodic system , @xmath2 describes an external driving and @xmath3 represents the term responsible for dissipative processes .",
    "the isolated quasi-1d periodic system is formed in a 2deg ( @xmath4 plane ) with rsoi using a periodic potential along the @xmath5-axis and a harmonic confinement along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the whole system is in a uniform stationary magnetic field along the @xmath6-axis : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath6-component of the magnetic field @xmath9 , and we have used the gauge in which the components of the vector potential are @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( landau gauge ) .",

    "only the @xmath5-component of the electric field vector is non - zero , that is the electric field is parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "experimentally this can be implemented using for example linearly polarized light .",
    "the external force thus couples only to the @xmath5-component of the electron coordinate operator : @xmath24 where the force @xmath25 is unbiased . in this work",
    "we use the time - dependence @xmath26 the term `` unbiased external force '' should not be confused with voltage bias .",
    "an external force is called unbiased if it is periodic in time and its mean value , that is its average over one period , is equal to zero .",
    "it is obviously our case as one can see from eq .",

    "the system is also coupled to an external bath . in the present work",
    "we assume the transverse confinement to be strong enough so that the probabilities of direct bath - excited transitions between the transverse modes are negligibly small .",
    "in other words , the wire is truly 1d from the point of view of the bath which directly changes only the dynamics along the wire .",
    "thus in our model the external environment couples to the electronic degrees of freedom only through @xmath27 .",

    "the transverse dynamics in the wire indirectly feels the presence of the external bath through the spin - orbit interaction and orbit - orbit coupling .",
    "the dynamical quantities of interest are the charge and spin currents .",

    "et al._@xcite the advantage of this definition over the conventional one ( @xmath39 ) is that using the corresponding spin current , @xmath40 the continuity equation for the spin density can often be written without a source term , which means that the spin current defined in this way is conserved .",
    "this conserved spin current can be uniquely related to the spin accumulation at a sample boundary .",

    "this definition leads to a very reasonable physical result : the corresponding spin current in ( [ spin_current ] ) vanishes in insulators . in section [ currents ] we will return to this point and analytically prove that when the periodic potential gets stronger and as a result the energy bands get narrower , that is when the system turns into an insulator , the spin current given by eq .",

    "the second condition is perhaps less transparent and a simplified physical interpretation is necessary .",
    "we propose the following physical explanation .",
    "the orbit - orbit coupling leads to the situation in which the strength of the periodic potential varies across the quasi-1d wire .",
    "the periodic potential is equal to @xmath184 in the center of the wire and gets stronger closer to its edges .",

    "for @xmath185 the electrons populate the center of the wire while for @xmath186 they are distributed in regions closer to the edges .",
    "hence , the electrons with @xmath185 are faster than those with @xmath186 . because of the mixing between the confinement and rsoi different transverse modes carry different spin states .",

    "on the other side , within the feynman path integral formalism , we see that in our system a transverse in - plane uniform stationary magnetic field can not produce the additional phase due to the integral of the vector potential along the feynman paths ( see appendix [ energy_spinors_magnetic_field ] ) .",
