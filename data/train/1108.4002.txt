    "the shape and nature of the fermi surface in underdoped cuprates remains an unresolved issue .",
    "cuprates are doped mott insulators .",
    "theoretically there is no doubt that minima of the dispersion of a single hole injected in the mott insulator are at the nodal points @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data from undoped cuprates .",
    "@xcite this implies that at a sufficiently small doping holes must go to the hole pockets .",
    "this is the small fermi surface situation . in real compounds disorder",
    "complicates the situation and significantly masks the generic physics .",
    "for example the prototypical cuprate la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 is so disordered that holes are strongly localized at doping @xmath10 . in the case of strong localization",
    "the notion of the fermi surface is ambiguous .",
    "arpes data from underdoped la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 reveal fermi arcs  @xcite that are not consistent either with the small ( hole pockets ) nor with the large fermi surface . on the other hand",
    "the very recent arpes data from underdoped bi@xmath11sr@xmath11cacu@xmath11o@xmath12 indicate small hole pockets .",
    "@xcite    yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) is probably the least disordered cuprate in the low doping regime . in this paper",
    "we denote doping @xmath13 to be the hole concentration per unit cell of the cuo@xmath11 layer .",
    "ybco is not superconducting below @xmath14 , where the compound remains a normal conductor with delocalized holes .",
    "the zero temperature resistivity remains finite ,  @xcite apart of a very weak logarithmic temperature dependence  @xcite expected for a weak disorder .",
    "the heat conductivity also indicates delocalization of holes .",
    "@xcite we emphasize that this is very different from la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 where holes are localized and hence the compound is the anderson insulator  @xcite at @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite ultimately , at the very low doping , @xmath16 , the disorder wins even in ybco and it also becomes the anderson insulator .",
    "@xcite it is helpful to have in mind an approximate empiric formula  @xcite @xmath17 to relate the doping level @xmath13 and the oxygen content @xmath18 in underdoped yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 at @xmath19 .",
    "the homogeneity of ybco is the reason why magnetic quantum oscillations ( mqo ) were observed in this compound .  @xcite the oscillations clearly indicate small fermi pockets",

    "the collinear antiferromagnetism ( af ) in ybco is preserved up to the doping level @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the zero temperature staggered magnetization @xmath21 is practically doping - independent , having the same value as in the parent mott insulator .",
    "@xcite this is the maximum value of magnetization allowed by quantum fluctuations of localized spins .",
    "the doping behavior of the staggered magnetization in ybco is very different from that in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 where the staggered magnetization decays dramatically with doping .",
    "a special mechanism has been proposed  @xcite to explain antiferromagnetism in ybco at @xmath22 . for purposes of the present work details of the mechanism",
    "are not important .",
    "the only important point is that the antiferromagnetism is independent of doping .",
    "this direct experimental observation in combination with simple metallic behaviour ( finite resistivity at zero temperature that is another direct experimental observation ) gives a unique opportunity to perform a controlled and fully reliable theoretical calculation of the electron spectral function at @xmath22 . in the present work",
    "we perform this calculation .",
    "our analysis is based on the @xmath23 model and employs the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",
    "scba has been widely applied to study a single hole dressed by spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite on the other hand application of the method at finite doping has been very limited  @xcite because a usual justification of the method requires a long range af order , and the common wisdom is that even a tiny doping destroys the order .",
    "af ordered ybco does not comply with the common wisdom and provides a unique opportunity to address spin fluctuations up to very high accuracy .",
    "the af order implies that the single loop vertex correction is forbidden ( the \" migdal theorem  ) , so scba is exact up to double loop corrections .",
    "@xcite    another important property of the quasiparticle dispersion is the layer bonding - antibonding splitting in the bilayer cuprate .",
    "a density functional theory calculation shows a more or less constant splitting through out the whole brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite arpes in overdoped ybco confirms the splitting .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in the underdoped regime arpes measurements  @xcite indicate no such splitting . to explain this in the present paper we show that antiferromagnetic correlations between layers in the bilayer system diminish the splitting in spite of the strong chemical tendency towards the splitting .",
    "the similar result for undoped ybco was previously obtained in ref .  .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations are due to the antiferromegnetic exchange @xmath24 between the layers .",
    "@xcite it is worth noting that the small hole pockets are essential for the suppression of the bilayer splitting in the underdoped regime .    in the present work we consider the clean limit without any disorder .",
    "there are recent arpes experiments on underdoped ybco  @xcite where the mechanism of doping is related to depositing of potassium atoms on the surface .",
    "the potassium ions give rise to a random potential for mobile holes .",

    "based on our results that we compare with arpes data we believe that the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 accepted in the present work are more suitable for underdoped ybco .",
    "however , in the end the difference between these two sets of parameters is not qualitatively important .",
    "we take a constant interlayer tunneling @xmath26 based again on the first principle calculation ,  @xcite which shows a practically constant splitting between bonding and antibonding bands with the value of the splitting corresponding to @xmath44 .",

    "@xcite however , due to the adler s theorem , magnons close to the goldstone point practically do not influence the hole dispersion , see discussion below . the main contribution to",
