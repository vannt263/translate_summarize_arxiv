    "a cosmological first - order phase transition may have several observable consequences , such as the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( for a review , see @xcite ) , the formation of topological defects @xcite , or the production of gravitational waves ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the estimation of these relics involves computing the development of the phase transition in order to determine quantities such as the bubble wall velocity , the number density of nucleated bubbles , and the distribution of bubble sizes .",
    "depending on the computational method , several approximations are usually necessary .",
    "in particular , it is customary to consider a constant wall velocity and specific analytical forms for the nucleation rate as a function of time . among the latter ,",
    "the most common assumptions are an exponentially growing rate , a constant rate , or just a simultaneous nucleation .",
    "the validity of these approximations depends on the strength of the phase transition .    for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "the free energy density @xmath0 is a function of an order parameter @xmath1 and has two minima separated by a barrier .",
    "the stable phase corresponds to the absolute minimum , while the metastable phase corresponds to a local minimum . for concreteness",
    ", we shall consider the case in which at high temperature @xmath2 we have a stable minimum @xmath3 , corresponding to a symmetric phase . at low temperatures ,",
    "this minimum becomes metastable , while a broken - symmetry minimum @xmath4 becomes the stable one ( we shall use the subscripts @xmath5 for quantities corresponding to each of these phases ) . at the critical temperature",
    "@xmath6 the two minima of @xmath7 are degenerate .",
    "several quantities , such as the energy density , are different in each phase .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the phase transition takes place at @xmath8 , these quantities are discontinuous functions of @xmath2 .",
    "the discontinuities depend on the jump of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath9 at @xmath8 can be regarded as an order parameter .",
    "the phase transition is usually said to be weakly first order if @xmath10 and strongly first order if @xmath11 .",
    "we shall be mainly interested in the case of very strong phase transitions , for which @xmath12 .    at @xmath13 or higher , the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume , @xmath14 , vanishes .",
    "therefore , the phase transition does not occur exactly at @xmath8 .",
    "below @xmath6 , the nucleation rate grows continuously from @xmath15 , and may reach , in principle , a value @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy scale characterizing the phase transition . in many cases",
    "there is a temperature @xmath18 at which the barrier separating the two minima disappears and the local minimum @xmath3 becomes a maximum ( see @xcite for a review ) . at this temperature",
    ", the phase transition would proceed through spinodal decomposition rather than by bubble nucleation .",
    "nevertheless , before reaching @xmath19 we would have @xmath20 , which is extremely large .",
    "indeed , the development of the phase transition depends crucially on the relation between @xmath21 and the expansion rate @xmath22 @xcite , since the number of bubbles @xmath23 nucleated in a causal volume @xmath24 in a cosmological time @xmath25 will be @xmath26 .",
    "while @xmath27 varies significantly , @xmath22 is roughly given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the planck mass .",
    "thus , for @xmath2 close enough to @xmath6 we will have @xmath30 and the nucleation of bubbles will be too slow , while for @xmath31 we have @xmath32 , since in most cases @xmath17 is several orders of magnitude below @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the phase transition will generally occur at an intermediate temperature between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 , and , due to the rapid growth of @xmath21 , it will end in a time @xmath37 .    for a weakly first - order phase transition",
    ", the barrier between minima is relatively small and the temperature @xmath38 is very close to @xmath6 . on the other hand , for stronger phase transitions we have a larger barrier which persists at smaller temperatures or even at @xmath39 . in such a case",
    "there is no temperature @xmath38 ( see @xcite for examples of such models ) , and the phase transition can last longer .    since in many cases the duration of the phase transition is short , the nucleation rate is sometimes approximated by a constant .",
    "this is convenient , e.g. , for involved computations such as numerical simulations , in which sometimes it is even necessary to nucleate all the bubbles simultaneously .",
    "however , it is the variation of @xmath21 with time what actually determines the dynamics of the transition . in general ,",
    "the nucleation rate is of the form @xmath40 , where the quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 are functions of temperature and , hence , of time . nevertheless , the variation of @xmath27 is dominated by the exponent @xmath41 .",
    "a common approximation is to assume that the duration of the phase transition is short enough to justify the expansion of @xmath41 to linear order about a suitable time @xmath43 .",
    "this gives a nucleation rate of the form @xmath44 ,   \\label{gammaexplin}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the last equality , the temperature variation @xmath47 is assumed , we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 the last factor yields @xmath2 , and we obtain eq .  ( [ beta ] ) . ] , where @xmath50 is the scale factor . the quantity @xmath51 is usually positive .",
    "this is because , as the temperature decreases from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , the barrier between minima decreases until disappearing .",
    "hence , the nucleation rate monotonically grows with time and the exponent @xmath41 decreases . with the approximation ( [ gammaexplin ] ) ,",
    "the parameter @xmath52 determines the time scale for the phase transition .",
    "thus , the duration is given by @xmath53 and the typical bubble size is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the bubble wall velocity .",
    "the latter can be assumed to be a constant if the duration of the phase transition is short enough .",
    "the expression ( [ gammaexplin ] ) is widely used as an approximation for the nucleation rate , either to simplify numerical computations or to obtain analytic results .",
    "one might expect that the essential conditions on which it is based , namely , that @xmath56 can be linearized and that @xmath57 is positive , are quite generally valid .",
    "however , both of these conditions may break down .",
    "one case in which this happens is that of a very strong phase transition , such that the barrier persists at @xmath39 .",
    "in such a case , as @xmath2 descends from @xmath6 the nucleation rate will initially grow ( as the barrier decreases ) , but for low enough temperatures @xmath21 will stop growing and will begin to decrease , since the presence of a barrier at small temperatures will prevent the nucleation of bubbles .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath21 has a maximum and @xmath41 has a minimum at a certain temperature @xmath58 . assuming that the system reaches such amounts of supercooling ,",
    "the linear approximation for @xmath56 will not be valid at the corresponding time @xmath59 .",
    "in such a case , the sign of @xmath51 will be different on each side of @xmath60 , and @xmath21 will clearly depart from the form ( [ gammaexplin ] ) .",
    "this approximation may also break down due to reheating .",
    "indeed , the energy density difference between the two phases ( latent heat ) is released at the bubble walls and reheats the surrounding plasma .",
    "such a temperature increase may cause a decrease of @xmath21 . nevertheless , the effect will depend on the wall velocity . indeed ,",
    "if the phase transition fronts propagate as detonations with supersonic velocities , the fluid in front of them remains unperturbed .",
    "thus , the reheating occurs only inside the bubbles , while in the metastable phase the nucleation rate continues growing due to the adiabatic cooling .",
    "the same holds for a runaway wall , i.e. , a wall which has not reached a steady state and propagates at almost the speed of light . for smaller wall velocities",
    "the bubbles expand as deflagrations .",
    "a deflagration wall is preceded by a shock wave which carries the released energy outside the bubble . in this case",
    ", the plasma in the metastable phase will be reheated , and the nucleation rate will be suppressed .",
    "this is a complex scenario , since the reheating is inhomogeneous , causing an inhomogeneous @xmath21 . besides",
    ", the growth of a bubble will be affected by the latent heat released by other bubbles , which complicates further the dynamics .",
    "we shall address this case elsewhere and focus here on very strong phase transitions , for which we generally have detonations or runaway walls .",
    "we shall study the dynamics of such very strong transitions .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to assess the limit of validity of the approximation ( [ gammaexplin ] ) , and to give an alternative analytic description of the transition , based on a simple approximation for the nucleation rate beyond this limit .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we identify the main aspects of the dynamics which are relevant for the possible cosmic remnants . in sec .",
    "[ dyn ] we use a realistic toy model to study the dynamics of the nucleation and growth of bubbles in very strong phase transitions . in sec .",
    "[ anap ] we consider analytic approximations for the nucleation rate .",
    "we show that , in the very strong limit , the exponential approximation breaks down and a gaussian approximation is more appropriate .",
    "the latter allows to obtain analytical results for the dynamics as much as the former .",
    "we analyse the ranges of validity of these approximations . in section [ aplic ]",
    "we compare the analytic results with the numerical computation , and we discuss the effect of using different approximations on the formation of cosmic remnants .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "the most important consequence of a very strong phase transition is probably the generation of sizeable gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are produced by the collisions of bubble walls @xcite as well as by the motions caused in the plasma @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the process of bubble collisions is usually computed with the envelope approximation @xcite , in which bubbles are modeled by thin spherical shells which expand with a constant velocity .",
    "this approximation has been used in numerical simulations @xcite in which the bubbles are nucleated at random positions with a rate given by eq .",
    "( [ gammaexplin ] ) .",
    "more recently , an analytic approach using the same approximations was considered @xcite .",
    "the general result is a gw spectrum which depends on the wall velocity and the constant @xmath57 .",
    "the quantity to be computed is the normalized energy density per logarithmic frequency of gws , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the total energy density in the plasma . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the peak frequency and amplitude from the envelope approximation are @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average energy density which accumulates in the thin shells .",
    "this corresponds to the gradient energy of the higgs field , which is a free parameter in the simulation .",
    "although fluid motions generally produce a larger signal of gws , bubble collisions become important for runaway walls , since in this case a significant fraction of the energy goes to the wall rather than to the fluid .",
    "the effects of the fluid motions could in principle be calculated using the envelope approximation , if one assumes that the energy is concentrated in a thin region @xcite . however ,",
    "this is generally not the case ( for a recent discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the fluid motions remain after the bubbles have filled all the space and their walls have already disappeared .",
    "lattice simulations @xcite of the field - fluid system suggest that the strongest source of gws are the sound waves generated in the plasma .",
    "a fit to these results is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the peak of the spectrum",
    "we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy density in bulk fluid motions , and @xmath68 is the average distance between bubble centers .",
    "it is important to mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath69 and @xmath70 are actually given in terms of @xmath57 rather than @xmath68 , although in the simulations all the bubbles were nucleated simultaneously and thus the scale is set by the bubble separation .",
    "the dependence on @xmath51 was imposed by the replacement @xmath71 , which corresponds to the analytic approximation we discuss in sec .",
    "[ anap ] .",
    "another possible remnant of a cosmological phase transition is a network of cosmic strings or other topological defects .",
    "moreover , these defects can only be formed in a phase transition of the universe . in the simplest case in which a global @xmath72 symmetry is spontaneously broken , the phase angle @xmath73 of the higgs field takes different values in uncorrelated regions . for a first - order phase transition , these regions are the nucleated bubbles . as bubbles meet and the variation of the phase from one domain to another is smoothed out , a vortex or string may be trapped in the meeting point of several bubbles @xcite .",
    "this determines a segment of string whose length depends on the bubble size .",
    "therefore , the strings will have the shape of random walks , where the step size depends on the size distribution of bubbles at the end of the phase transition .",
    "the statistical properties of the system of strings were studied using monte carlo simulations , in which a large volume is divided in cubic cells of fixed size , corresponding to the correlation length @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the result is that about 20% of the total length of strings is contributed by closed loops , while the rest are infinite strings .",
    "the number density of loops per loop length is given by @xmath75 .",
    "for a first - order phase transition , the characteristic length @xmath74 is roughly given by the average distance @xmath68 between bubble centers .",
    "more realistic simulations of the phase transition were performed in 2 + 1 dimensions , nucleating bubbles at random positions and at random times @xcite .",
    "the resulting number of defects per unit volume depends on the number density of bubbles and the wall velocity .",
    "numerical simulations for gauge symmetry braking were also performed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the probability for trapping a defect actually depends on the dynamics of the higgs phase @xmath73 .",
    "this dynamics is important for slow bubble walls , since the phase difference between two bubbles could equilibrate before a third bubble meets them .",
    "this results in the formation of a smaller number of defects for smaller velocities . on the other hand , for very strong phase transitions we generally have @xmath63 , in which case the dynamics of phase equilibration can be neglected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other cosmological consequences of the phase transition depend on similar aspects of the dynamics .",
    "for instance , the formation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe in the electroweak phase transition ( electroweak baryogenesis ) depends strongly on the velocity of bubble walls .",
    "furthermore , in this case , variations of the wall velocity may lead to baryon inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "the shape of these inhomogeneities will be similar inside each bubble , and their size will be determined by the bubble radius .",
    "we shall not discuss this possibility here , since the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis generally requires small velocities , @xmath76-@xmath77 @xcite , which are not likely in the case of very strong phase transitions ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "in any case , all these examples show that two aspects of the phase transition dynamics are relevant for the formation of cosmic remnants , namely , the wall velocity and the distribution of bubble sizes .",
    "a complete calculation of the remnants involves the whole evolution of the phase transition .",
    "notice that , in order to take into account the global dynamics ( i.e. , the expansion and collisions of many bubbles ) in a realistic way , the dynamics of bubble nucleation is generally simplified .",
    "this is accomplished by considering specific forms for the nucleation rate , which are not necessarily realistic .",
    "thus , for lattice simulations it is usual to either nucleate all the bubbles simultaneously or at a constant rate , while in less time - consuming simulations the exponential approximation ( [ gammaexplin ] ) is often used .",
    "in order to investigate the general features of the phase transition dynamics , we shall consider a simple free energy depending on a few parameters . for several considerations it actually suffices to use simple functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 to describe the free energy density of each phase , which in a real model are given by the corresponding minima , @xmath80 .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath81 and the energy density by @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "thus , these functions define the equation of state ( eos ) in each phase",
    ". however , a realistic treatment of bubble nucleation requires specifying the whole dependence of @xmath0 on the order - parameter field @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we will consider a free energy density of the form @xmath84 where the first term is the field - dependent part , which vanishes for @xmath85 , the second term corresponds to massless particles which do not interact with @xmath1 ( with a total number of effective degrees of freedom @xmath86 ) , and the constant @xmath87 is the vacuum energy density for @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the total energy density of the phase @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the radiation energy density .",
    "the hubble rate will be essentially determined by the quantity @xmath91 , while the nucleation rate will depend only on the @xmath1-dependent part @xmath92 .",
    "the simplest physical model which may provide very strong phase transitions is given by a finite - temperature effective potential of the form @xmath93 for @xmath94 , eq .",
    "( [ potef ] ) has the well - known form of the high - temperature expansion of the one - loop effective potential , for a tree - level potential of the form @xmath95 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath103 a further quantity of interest will be the latent heat @xmath104 .",
    "we have @xmath105    the strength of the phase transition is directly related to the cubic term of the potential .",
    "indeed , for @xmath94 and @xmath106 we have @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and the phase transition is second order . in this case , for @xmath109 the minimum moves continuously to @xmath110 , while the point @xmath111 becomes a maximum . for @xmath112 or @xmath113",
    "the phase transition is first order . in this case , at @xmath114 the point @xmath115 is a maximum and the only minimum is @xmath116 . at @xmath117",
    "the maximum becomes a minimum , and the two minima coexist up to a temperature @xmath118 , where the minimum @xmath4 disappears .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath6 lies between @xmath38 and @xmath118 . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ fic ] ) , for @xmath94 the quantity @xmath101 is proportional to the parameter @xmath119 .",
    "this means that in this case the first - order nature of the phase transition is due to a fluctuation - induced cubic term , which is not present in the tree - level potential . in a realistic model",
    ", @xmath119 depends cubically on the couplings of bosons with @xmath1 , and it is difficult to obtain a relatively strong phase transition ( i.e. , one in which @xmath120 ) .",
    "in contrast , eq .  ( [ fic ] ) shows that adding a tree - level cubic term increases the order parameter , and we obtain a strongly first - order phase transition for @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , runaway walls are only possible if the first - order nature of the phase transition is due to zero - temperature terms @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to relate the parameters of the potential to physical quantities . in the first place , the zero - temperature minimum @xmath122 is given as a function of the parameters by eq .",
    "( [ fime ] ) .",
    "if we want to vary the shape of the potential without changing the characteristic scale of the theory , then we must fix the value of @xmath17 .",
    "this sets the value of the spinodal - decomposition temperature , @xmath123 this temperature decreases for increasing @xmath124 , indicating that the barrier between minima persists at lower temperatures .",
    "notice that for @xmath125 we have @xmath126 , which indicates that in this case the potential has a barrier even at @xmath39 .",
    "hence , large values of @xmath124 will imply large amounts of supercooling . on the other hand",
    ", the value of @xmath127 should be such that the curvature of the potential is naturally given by the scale @xmath17 .",

    "<S> strongly first - order phase transitions , i.e. , those with a large order parameter , are characterized by a considerable supercooling and high velocities of phase transition fronts . </S>",
    "<S> a very strong phase transition may have important cosmological consequences due to the departures from equilibrium caused in the plasma . in general , there is a limit to the strength , since the metastability of the old phase may prevent the transition to complete . </S>",
    "<S> near this limit , the bubble nucleation rate achieves a maximum and thus departs from the widely assumed behavior in which it grows exponentially with time . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of this kind of phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in some cases a gaussian approximation for the nucleation rate is more suitable , and in such a case we solve analytically the evolution of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the gaussian and exponential approximations with realistic cases and we determine their ranges of validity . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the implications for cosmic remnants such as gravitational waves . </S>"
