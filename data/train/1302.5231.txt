    "entanglement is a term used in quantum theory to describe the fact that the particles can be correlated with each other regardless of how far they are from each other @xcite .",
    "many current studies @xcite focus on how to harness the potential of entanglement in the development of quantum cryptography , quantum communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "the growth in interest in entanglement applications has stimulated intensive qualitative and quantitative research of entanglement in various physical systems and in both equilibrium @xcite and non - equilibrium @xcite , including the pseudo - pure state @xcite as a initial state @xcite .",
    "it was shown that quantum systems in thermal equilibrium became entangled , if the interaction energy between them is larger than thermal energy due to their coupling to the environment .",
    "this condition leads to that entanglement appears only at very low temperature .",
    "for example , entanglement in dipolar coupled spin system in equilibrium state is achieved by the application of a low external magnetic field in which the zeeman interaction energy is the order of or even less than the dipolar interaction energy , @xmath2 @xcite . for a proton spin systems ,",
    "the dipolar energy is @xmath3 khz .",
    "that results in the temperature of the entanglement appearance of @xmath4 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "recently , it was proved that this relationship between temperature and entanglement is not justified for systems that are not in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium cases , as it was shown that entanglement in quantum systems being in a non - equilibrium state can appear at much higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "investigations of spin systems demonstrate this statement : e.g. a spin system , which is in a separated state at equilibrium , is irradiated by a radiofrequency field and goes out from the equilibrium , and entanglement appears in the system simultaneously @xcite .    the present paper deals with the opposite case when the system being initially in a non - equilibrium state evolves to an equilibrium state .",
    "this entanglement dynamics during the natural process of establishing equilibrium is an actual problem which , according to our knowledge , does not studied yet .",
    "we study entanglement dynamics in a dipolar coupled spin-1/2 system under the transition from non - equilibrium state to equilibrium state .",
    "we consider a spin system , which can be divided to two thermodynamic subsystems which are in the equilibrium state and characterized by two different temperatures ( so - called a quasi - equilibrium state @xcite ) .",
    "the process of establishing equilibrium in the whole system can be represented as equalization of their temperatures .",
    "such quasi - equilibrium states were prepared experimentally using various methods @xcite .",
    "these states can be considered as the last stage in relaxation process from non - equilibrium state to equilibrium one .",
    "existence of such states can be explained by using the fundamental principles of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics first formulated by bogolyubov @xcite . in non - equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , a fundamental role is played hierarchy of the relaxation times and reducing in the number of parameters requested for the description of a non - equilibrium process . as shown by bogolyubov , after the lapse of a small interval of time , of the order of the duration of a collision , all higher distribution functions are completely determined by a single - particle function , and kinetic equations can be found for this stage .",
    "this means it is possible to use an abbreviated description of a non - equilibrium state in which the complete distribution function depends on few parameters .",
    "bogolyubov s idea about hierarchy of the relaxation times has been widely used for description of relaxation processes in spin systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the correlation times are much shorter than the time @xmath6 the lifetime of the free precession signal , and the time @xmath7 is shorter then the characteristic time of an investigated process , then the equilibrium state is established in parts of the spin system before the whole system reaches the total equilibrium .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe the hamiltonian for a spin system in an external field at the equilibrium and quasi - equilibrium states and principale of the provotorov saturation theory @xcite . according to this theory in a dipolar coupled spin system in a quasi - equilibrium state , two spin temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "can be assigned to the zeeman and dipolar thermodynamic subsystems @xcite . in section 3 establishment of the equilibrium state is analyzed .",
    "then we consider dynamics of the pairwise entanglement in a quasi - equilibrium state which is characterized by these two temperatures .",
    "discussion of the results is given in the final section .",
    "numerical calculations of evolution of the spin temperature and concurrence @xmath10 between the @xmath11-th and @xmath12-th spins are performed using the software based on the matlab package . to demonstrate dependence of the entanglement dynamics on the relative spin position we will consider three four - spin systems : linear chain , ring , and rectangle .",
    "the choice of these systems is due to the following reasons : i ) these structures exist in real molecules and used in experiments and ii ) as dipole - dipole interactions decrease inversely to the third power of the distance between the spins , the effect of the system geometry is manifested more clearly at a small number of spins .",
    "we consider the system of identical spin-1/2 particles with the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) in an external magnetic field @xmath13 along the @xmath14 - axis . in the equilibrium state",
    "the system is characterized by a density matrix @xmath15 with a single parameter @xmath16 denotes the inverse spin temperature , @xmath17 is the spin temperature , and @xmath18 is the partition function .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of the two parts , @xmath19 @xmath20 , the zeeman part @xmath21 and the dipolar part @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath24 is the angular momentum operator of the @xmath25-th spin ( @xmath25 = @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the radius vector from the @xmath25-th to @xmath28-th spins with the spherical coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30  is the angle between the radius vector @xmath27 and direction of the external magnetic field .    in low magnetic field , when the zeeman energy splitting @xmath32 , and ddi energy @xmath33  are commensurable quantities , the time for reaching equilibrium state describing by eq.(1 ) is determined by @xmath34 which is of the order of @xmath7 @xcite .    in high magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath35 , the time @xmath36 for reaching equilibrium becomes very long , @xmath37 , due to the fact that the energy spectra of the zeeman energy and the ddi energy are very different @xcite .",
    "we will consider the spin system placed in high magnetic field as two thermodynamic subsystems , the zeeman and dipole - dipole ones , each of them is at thermodynamic equilibrium with own spin temperature and between which there is an energy transfer .",

    "separation of the spin system into the zeeman and dipolar subsystems is consequence of the fact that the zeeman @xmath51 and dipolar energies@xmath52 are separately constants of the motion , while both @xmath53 and @xmath54 depend on both thermodynamics parameters , @xmath55and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "results ( 5 - 7 ) have been conformed by experiments @xcite . @xmath57    the time for reaching the quasi - equilibrium state described by eq .",

    "as it is shown below , the entangled states can be achieved in the cases when a difference @xmath87 can not be regarded as a small parameter .",
    "we can not also use the high - temperature approximation and the expansion of ( 11 ) in powers of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the perturbation theory methods can not be applied effectively to study entanglement in the considered systems .",
    "we will solve numerically eq .",
    "( 12 ) for four - spin systems with various geometry : chain , circle , and rectangle .",
    "examples of such systems are quasi - one - dimensional fluorine chains in calcium fluorapatite @xmath89 @xcite , xenon tetrafluoride with chemical formula @xmath90(its crystalline square planar structure was determined by both nmr spectroscopy and by neutron diffraction studies @xcite ) , and 1,4-dichlorobenzene @xmath91 with a rectangle planar structure .",

    "1 shows evolution of the inverse temperatures @xmath55and @xmath56 toward the equilibrium value of the four - spin systems in the form of a chain , a circle , and a rectangle .",
    "these systems demonstrate qualitatively similar time dependences of @xmath115and @xmath56 . at a high ratio @xmath116 it is possible to mark out four stages in the @xmath56 time dependences .",
    "these stages are clearly seen in the @xmath56 time dependence for a circle spin system ( fig . 1a , black line ) . the first stage , @xmath117 is characterized by a fast drop of the inverse temperature about twice . during the second stage , @xmath118 , the rate of the @xmath56 drop is decreased , and it is increased again at the next stage @xmath119 . the dependence is substantivally non - exponential .",
    "only at the last stage when of the temperature difference is small , the time dependence can be fitted by an exponential laws with the characteristic time close to @xmath120 .",
    "of course , these stages can be marked out in the @xmath75 time dependences .",
    "however the variations of the zeeman temperatures are very small because the heat capacity of the zeeman subsystem is high .",
    "the inverse temperature of the zeeman subsystem @xmath75 increases less than by 2.5% ( fig .",
    "1b ) , while the inverse temperature of the dipolar subsystem decreases 70 times ( fig .",
    "1a ) .    with decreasing a ratio of the zeeman energy splitting to the dipolar energy , the behave of the time dependence is changed .",
    "only two stages can be marked out as a ratio @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "1a , blue dash - dotted line ) .",
    "both stages can be fitted by the exponential laws with characteristic times , @xmath122 : @xmath123 for the first stage @xmath117 and @xmath124 the second one by .",
    "so , the decrease of the ratio of the zeeman energy splitting to the dipolar energy leads to the increase of the characteristic time of achieving the equilibrium state .",
    "several parameters have been proposed for characterizing the entangled state of a spin system : the von neumann entropy , entanglement of formation , log negativity , concurrence of a pair of spins , and etc .",
    "we will characterize the entangled states by the concurrence between two , @xmath11-th and @xmath12-th , spins which is defined as @xcite @xmath125 with @xmath126 . here",
