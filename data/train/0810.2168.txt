    "quark matter at large quark chemical potential @xmath0 is a weekly coupling system because momenta exchanged in the interaction between quarks near the fermi surface is of order @xmath0 , which makes the coupling constant @xmath1 small due to the property of asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this case , the dominant interaction between two quarks is one - gluon exchange , which is attractive in the color - antitriplet channel .",
    "consequently , at sufficiently low temperatures , the quark fermi surface is unstable with respect to the formation of cooper pairs @xcite which leads to the so - called color superconducting ( csc ) state @xcite ( for reviews , see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in a superconductor , exciting particle - hole pairs costs at least an energy amount @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the value of the superconductor gap parameter at the fermi surface for @xmath4 and",

    "therefore , the naive mean - field approach to the gap equation with bare @xmath18 vertices is not enough to guarantee the gauge independence even at the subleading level .",
    "a general way to study gauge independence is to make use of ward identities .",
    "this approach has been frequently used to show the gauge independence of physical collective excitations in thermal gauge theories , like hot qcd @xcite .",

    "recently gerhold and rebhan @xcite used generalized nielsen identities to give a formal proof that the fermionic quasiparticle dispersion relation in a color superconductor are gauge independent under the assumption that the 1pi part of variation induced by that of gauge fixing function in the effective action has no singularities coinciding with those of quark propagator .",
    "we have provided another proof of gauge independence of 2sc gap by deriving a generalized ward identity from qcd with diquark condensate and by applying it to gap equation @xcite .    in this paper , we present an investigation of the vertex contributions in the gap equation . the calculation is done in nambu - gorkov ( ng ) formalism in super - phase with diquark condensates .",
