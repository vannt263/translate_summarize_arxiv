    "in the study of ultracold dilute gases , the effect of atom - atom collisions is , in most cases , described by means of a regularized zero - range pseudopotential whose coupling constant is related to the scattering length @xmath2 of the two - atom system @xcite . due to this crucial role ,",
    "several authors have been concerned to calculate the scattering length for interatomic potentials .",
    "numerical methods are unavoidable in the case of general realistic interactions .",
    "there are , however , particular forms of potentials whose scattering length is susceptible of being computed algebraically .",
    "examples are the hard - core potential with a @xmath3 tail @xcite , and the potentials discussed by pade @xcite .",
    "these , besides of being analytical at any distance , are able to reproduce the general trend of experimental data .    motivated by the mentioned papers of pade , we present here an exact method of computing the scattering length applicable to any sum of inverse power potentials . in particular , to illustrate the method , we consider here a ( 12 , s ) lennard - jones type potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced mass of the two interacting atoms , @xmath6 represents the classical turning point , and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter giving the intensity of the interaction . for the exponent @xmath1 of the long range part of the potential we have considered three different values : @xmath8 , as in the familiar van der waals potential , @xmath9 , as in the case of atom - ion collisions @xcite , and @xmath10 , as in the retarded atom - atom potential @xcite .",
    "this last case is exactly solvable , as shown by pade ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 5 ) with @xmath11 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as a test , we apply our method to solve it .",
    "our procedure , quite unconventional , has been successfully applied to the solution of the schrdinger equation with a polynomial potential @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the transformation @xmath12 converts the problems at hand into different anharmonic oscillators . )",
    "the reduced radial schrdinger equation with the potential ( [ uno ] ) , in the case of energy and angular momentum equal to zero , reads @xmath13 this differential equation presents two singular points : a regular one at infinity , of indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and an irregular one at the origin .",
    "two independent solutions can be immediately written as power series of @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 and coefficients @xmath19 given by the recurrence relation @xmath20 those series expansions are convergent for any value of @xmath21 , except for @xmath22 . the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) is but a linear combination of the two basic solutions @xmath23 .",
    "let us suppose that the ( unnormalized ) physical solution is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants , to be determined , such that @xmath27 becomes regular at the origin .",
    "then , for large @xmath21 , @xmath28 and , consequently , the scattering length would be given by @xmath29 the determination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 requires the knowledge of the behaviour of @xmath30 and @xmath31 at the origin .",
    "this is what is known as the _ connection problem _ for the two singular points of the differential equation ( [ dos ] ) . in what follows ,",
    "we present our solution of that problem .",
    "let us simplify the notation by using , instead of @xmath21 , the dimensionless variable @xmath32 in terms of the new variable , the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath33 with @xmath34 the basic solutions given in eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) are , in terms of @xmath35 , @xmath36    in order to represent the behaviour of these functions at the origin , it is convenient to consider the two ( formal ) thom solutions at that singular point , @xmath37 the label @xmath38 being to be replaced by @xmath39 or @xmath40 , according to the behaviour , regular or irregular , of these formal solutions at the origin , which is determined by the sign of @xmath41 . substitution of these formal expressions in eq .",
    "( [ nueve ] ) gives the condition @xmath42 , and consequently @xmath43 the exponent @xmath44 and the recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath45 @xmath46 in the cases of @xmath9 or @xmath47 , or @xmath48 if @xmath10 .",
    "( notice that in this case the recurrence relation reduces to a linear difference equation of first order and , therefore , it is exactly solvable . ) then , the behaviour of the basic solutions at the origin can be expressed in the form @xmath49 the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are called _",
    "connection factors_. their determination solves the connection problem .",
    "it allows also one to obtain immediately the scattering length , as we are going to show .",
    "substitution of the last expressions of @xmath52 in @xmath53 gives , for @xmath54 , @xmath55 since the physical solution has to be regular at the origin , it must be @xmath56 giving for the scattering length @xmath57 for the computation of the connection factors , we have found convenient to express them as quotients of ( constant ) wronskians of the concerned solutions . taking the wronskian of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ dsiete ] ) with @xmath58 and isolating @xmath59 one obtains @xmath60/\\mathcal{w}\\left[w_{\\rm{irr}},w_{\\rm{reg}}\\right ] ,   \\label{vdos}\\ ] ] that , substituted in eq .",

    "( [ vocho ] ) was discussed in ref .",

    "( [ tcinco ] ) can be chosen arbitrarily with the only restriction @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , a test of the procedure is the necessary coincidence of the results obtained for different choices of @xmath82 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the behavior of the values of @xmath88 obtained with our method , for the particular case of @xmath8 , as the intensity @xmath7 of the potential goes from 0 to 2500 . notice that we have represented , on the horizontal axis , the values of @xmath89 instead of those of @xmath7 . in his study of solvable potentials of the lennard - jones type with exponents @xmath90 , pade @xcite",
    "has shown that the difference of the values of the square root of the intensity corresponding to two consecutive zeros or poles of @xmath2 is a constant , namely @xmath91 . in the case of figure 1 ,",
    "such difference is not exactly , but nearly a constant .",
    "similar graphics are obtained for other values of @xmath1 in the potential ( [ uno ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as far as the sign of the scattering length determines the attractive or repulsive nature of the zero - range pseudopotential and , consequently , the possibility of formation of bose - einstein condensates , the precise location of the zeros and poles of @xmath88 is crucial .",
    "moreover , as it is well known , a new bound state arises whenever the increasing intensity of the potential coincides with one of the poles .",
    "our procedure allows to locate zeros and poles , by requiring cancelation of the wronskians @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] given by eq .",
    "( [ tcinco ] ) , with a precision limited only by the number of digits carried in the computation .",
