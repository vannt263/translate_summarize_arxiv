    "the wormhole spacetime for @xmath4 sphere is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the redshift function and @xmath20 is the shape function . for traversable wormhole scenario",
    ", we have to choose @xmath21 to be finite to satisfy the no - horizon condition .",
    "usually , it is taken as zero for the sake of simplicity , which gives @xmath22 .",
    "the reason behind finite redshift function is as follows .",
    "the redshift function defines that part of the metric responsible for finding the magnitude of the gravitational redshift .",
    "the gravitational redshift is the reduction in the frequency that a photon will experience when it climbs out from gravitational potential well in order to escape to infinity . in doing so",
    ", the photon uses energy .",
    "its energy is proportional to its frequency .",
    "a reduction in energy , then is equivalent to a reduction in frequency , which is also known as redshift function .",
    "if the wormhole has an event horizon , it means that a photon emitted outwardly from the horizon can not escape to infinity . in other words",
    ", it would take an infinite amount of energy for the photon to escape .",
    "its frequency would be infinity reduced , i.e. , its redshift would be negatively infinite .",
    "a negatively infinite value of the redshift function at a particular value of the radial coordinate indicates the presence of an event horizon there .",
    "thus to be traversable wormhole solution , the magnitude of its redshift function must be finite .",
    "the shape of the wormhole is such that a spherical hole in space with increasing length of diameter as moving far from throat ( the minimum non - zero value of radial coordinate denoted as @xmath23 ) and combine two asymptomatically flat regions . in order to have a proper shape of the wormhole",
    ", the shape function must attain the ratio to radial coordinate as @xmath24 and represents increasing behavior with respect to radial coordinate which is @xmath25 .",
    "this condition of ratio is known as flare - out condition .",
    "in addition , the value of shape function and radial coordinate must be same at throat , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "there are also some other constraints applied on the derivative of shape functions which must satisfy .",
    "these are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "also , the proper distance , @xmath29 must meet the criteria as decreasing behavior from upper region @xmath30 towards throat where @xmath31 and then towards lower region where @xmath32 .    in order to make the wormhole to be traversable",
    ", the throat must remain open . to prevent shrinking of wormhole throat ,",
    "there must exists such form of energy - momentum tensor which provides the corresponding matter content .",
    "this matter content violates the energy conditions in order to keep throat open and thus , named as exotic matter .",
    "this implies that violation of these conditions is the basic key ingredient to construct traversable wormhole solutions . since the usual energy - momentum tensor satisfies the energy conditions .",
    "therefore , the search for wormhole solutions for which violation may come from other source while matter content satisfies energy conditions becomes one of the most challenging problem in astrophysics .",
    "the higher dimensional gravity theories and modified theories may play positive role by providing violation from higher order lagrangian terms and effective form of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the relationship between raychaudhuri equation and attractiveness of gravity yields the * weak energy condition ( wec ) * as @xmath33 , for any timelike vector @xmath34 . in terms of components of the energy - momentum tensor",

    "in order to discuss the wormhole geometry and solutions , there are several frameworks and strategies used to find unknown functions .",
    "for instance , we have five unknown functions @xmath47 and @xmath20 in the underlying case .",
    "one may choose some kind of equation of state representing accelerated expansion of the universe , or different forms of energy density such as energy density of static spherically symmetric object with non - commutative geometry having gaussian or lorentzian distributions and galactic halo region etc .",
    "the traceless energy - momentum tensor is also used which is related to the casimir effect . in order to construct viable wormhole solutions in @xmath0-dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , we assume different forms of energy density of non - commutative geometry in the following .",
    "nicolini et al . @xcite",
    "have improved the short distance behavior of point - like structures in a new conceptual approach based on coordinate coherent state formalism to noncommutative gravity . in their method , curvature singularities which appear in general relativity , can be eliminated .",
    "they have demonstrated that black hole evaporation process should be stopped when a black hole reaches a minimal mass .",
    "this minimal mass , named black hole remnant , is a result of the existence of a minimal observable length .",
    "this approach , which is the so - called noncommutative geometry inspired model , via a minimal length caused by averaging noncommutative coordinate fluctuations cures the curvature singularity in black holes .",
    "in fact , the curvature singularity at the origin of black holes is substituted for a regular de - sitter core .",
    "accordingly , the ultimate phase of the hawking evaporation as a novel thermodynamically steady state comprising a non - singular behavior is concluded .",
    "it must be noted that , generally , it is not required to consider the length scale of the coordinate non - commutativity to be the same as the planck length . since , the non - commutativity influences appear on a length scale connected to that region , they can behave as an adjustable parameter corresponding to that pertinent scale .",
    "the presence of a universal short distance cut - off leads to the effects such as in quantum field theory , it curves uv divergences while it cures curvature singularities in general relativity . in the specific case of the gravity field equations ,",
    "the only modification occurs at the level of the energy - momentum tensor , while @xmath48 is formally left unchanged . in non - commutative space",
    ", the usual definition of mass density in the form of dirac delta function does not hold .",
    "so in this space the usual form of the energy density of the static spherically symmetry smeared and particlelike gravitational source requires some other forms of distribution .    in view of the above explanations",
    ", we are going to discuss wormhole solutions with the help of two well - known energy distributions such as gaussian and lorentzian in non - commutative scenario . as an important remark ,",
    "the essential aspects of the non - commutativity approach are not specifically sensitive to any of these distributions of the smearing effects @xcite rather only distribution parameter is defferent .",
    "the gaussian source has also been used by sushkov @xcite to model phantom - energy supported wormholes , as well as by nicolini and spalluci @xcite for the purpose of modeling the physical effects of short distance fluctuations of noncommutative coordinates in the study of black holes .",
    "galactic rotation curves inspired by a non - commutative geometry background are discussed @xcite .",
    "the stability of a particular class of thin - shell wormholes in noncommutative geometry is analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an intrinsic characteristic of spacetime is the non - commutativity which plays an effective role in several areas .",
    "it is an interesting consequence of string theory where the coordinates of spacetime become non - commutative operators on @xmath3-brane @xcite .",
    "the non - commutativity of spacetime can be converted in the commutator , @xmath49=i\\theta^{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , where @xmath50 is an anti - symmetric matrix describing discretization of spacetime and has dimension @xmath51 .",
    "this discretization process is similar to the discretization of phase space by planck constant .",
    "replacing the point - like structures with smeared objects , the energy density of the particle - like static spherically symmetric gravitational source having mass @xmath52 takes the following form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the non - commutative parameter in gaussian distribution . the mass m could be a diffused centralized object such as a wormhole [ 23 ]",
    "it is mentioned here that the smearing effect is achieved by replacing the gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath55 with the dirac delta function . in order to construct @xmath0-dimensional einstein gauss - bonnet wormhole geometry",

    "figure * 4(i ) * depicts the opposite behavior to plot * 3(i ) * , i.e. , for @xmath79 dimensions and positive @xmath80 demonstrates negative behavior .",
