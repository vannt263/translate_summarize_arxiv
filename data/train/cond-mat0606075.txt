    "in this article , we illustrate that in general short range klein type spin models , _ all _ ground states must be of the valence bond type .",
    "this will allow us to establish high dimensional fractionalization in these systems .",
    "we start with a concise definition of the klein model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we first divide the system into fundamental units @xmath0 . with the sum of all spins in @xmath0 denoted by @xmath1 , and @xmath2 with @xmath3 the size of the spin at every site and @xmath4 the number of the spins in @xmath0 , the klein model hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath5 here ,",
    "@xmath6 the projection operator onto the space with maximal spin .",
    "for instance , for a spin @xmath7 system on a square lattice , @xmath0 is the elementary four site plaquette ; here , we project onto the state of spin @xmath8 .",
    "explicit forms for klein models for the hexagonal , @xcite square , @xcite decorated and general other lattices @xcite , extension of @xcite to @xmath9 @xcite , and a slightly comprehensive study of pyrochlore lattices @xcite are available . in @xcite",
    "it was first shown how this may lead to fractionalization and effective dimensional reduction- a theme which was extended in @xcite where spinons could propagate in finite size volume fractions of the lattice .",
    "the central thesis of many of these results is that the pertinent ground states are of the dimer type .",
    "i.e. , all ground states are superpositions of singlet product states , @xmath10    here , @xmath11 is a singlet state formed between the two spins found at sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in eq.([ws ] ) , @xmath14 denote a partition of sites in plaquettes on the lattice into such singlet dimers such that , at least , one dimer appears in every plaquette .",
    "clearly , on some choices of plaquettes on various lattices , such as the triangular lattice , if the elementary plaquette may be chosen to be any spin and all of its nearest neighbors , the constraint of one dimer per plaquette allows for many spins to not be in any dimer singlet states .",
    "@xcite this extra freedom that several remaining spins on such lattices may enjoy is specified by @xmath15 . on the lattices that we will focus on here ( the square , checkerboard , and pyrochlore lattices ) , no such freedom is found ( the factor @xmath15 does not appear ) .    while it is obvious that if any elementary plaquette hosts at least one singlet dimer , @xmath16 and thus is a ground state , the converse is not as obvious . in @xcite , it was shown how the klein spin model on the hexagonal lattice , two leg ladders , and on octagonal diamond lattices needed to be of superpositions of only dimer states of the form of eq.([singlet ] ) .",
    "we now prove that this result is universal and holds on a far greater variety of lattices .",
    "this proof is the central result of this article .",
    "henceforth , we focus on @xmath7 spin systems . on any lattice ,",
    "a single plaquette state is completely symmetric under all permutations if and only if it lies in the sector of total spin @xmath17 . as each permutation",
    "can be expressed as a product of pair permutations , it follows that @xmath18 iff @xmath19 can be written as a sum of plaquette state with at least one ( antisymmetric ) singlet state between two sites .",
    "any wavefunction which is orthogonal to all plaquette wavefunctions having , at least , one singlet state must be completely symmetric in all of the spins and therefore lies entirely in @xmath20 sector . far more demanding symmetry / antisymmetry restrictions of the wavefunction on the entire lattice formed the corner stone of the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we will now show that the above single plaquette result leads to the form of the ground state on the entire lattice .",
    "we now generalize the single plaquette result to the entire lattice . as ( i )",
    "the projection operator on any plaquette ( @xmath21 ) is non - negative definite , @xmath22 ( ii ) states with one dimer per plaquette have zero energy saturate consequent the low energy bound ( @xmath23 ) and are thus ground states ( yet not obviously the sole ground states ) , and as ( iii ) the hamiltonian is a sum over non - negative definite projection operators over each plaquette , we have that in any ground state @xmath24 @xmath25 here , @xmath21 is any chosen plaquette @xmath12 . as @xmath26 ,",
    "this , of course , mandates that @xmath27 for all plaquettes @xmath12 .",
    "now , by eq.([square+ ] ) , @xmath28 if @xmath29 then @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in the ground state we need to satisfy @xmath31 for all plaquettes @xmath12 .",
    "we next write the state @xmath24 in a general form in the complete orthonormal @xmath32 eigenbasis of the entire lattice ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34    if @xmath35 then , according to our earlier proof of the last section ( following eq.([zeroc ] ) ) concerning the single plaquette wavefunctions , @xmath36 must be a superposition of states each of which has , at least , one singlet .",
    "as this holds for all plaquettes @xmath21 , we must have @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the operator permuting the two sites @xmath39 .",
    "every plaquette ( @xmath21 ) must therefore have at least one intra - plaquette singlet dimer ( or superpositions of states thereof ) .",
    "this concludes our proof .    on general lattices , all ground states are superspositions of states of the form of eq.([ws ] ) .",
    "all ground states are superpositions of states which have , at least , one singlet on every plaquette . for @xmath7 klein models on the square , pyrochlore , or checkerboard lattices endowed with periodic boundary conditions , the most general states satisfying this requirement are of the form @xmath40 ) .",
    "key steps in the above proof are ( i ) the basis states @xmath41 are linearly independent ; this allowed us to impose the condition @xmath42 for _ any _ @xmath43 , ( ii ) the projection operator squared is equal to itself , eq.([square+ ] ) ; this led to the condition @xmath31 for all plaquettes @xmath12 .    ) ) wherein on each plaquette ( tetrahedron or crossed square ) a dimer connects the bases of the two arrows going to the center of the plaquette on which the dimer is found.,width=340 ]    a decoration procedure readily allows for a demonstration of a gap between the ground and excited states .",

    "] joining the vertex coverings according to the standard prescription @xcite allows to label all permitted ground states .",
    "right : an elementary local spin interaction process , leading to a new dimer configuration ( b ) , corresponds in the line representation ( d ) to flipping one of the line corners.,width=340 ]    to explicitly flesh out some of the more abstract concepts discussed hitherto , we examine the klein model on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the klein hamiltonian on the pyrochlore and checkerboard lattices is a sum of nearest neighbor interactions augmented by ring exchange terms . here",
    ", the hamiltonian is of the form @xcite @xmath44 , \\nonumber \\label{esh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes all pairs of sites in the tetrahedron @xmath46 .",
    "the klein model is realized when @xmath47 . on the checkerboard lattice",
    ", @xmath48 denotes each tetrahedral unit of the pyrochlore lattice or crossed plaquette of the checkerboard lattice with cross  coupling interactions .",
    "the first term is equivalent to both nearest and next  neighbor heisenberg interactions of strength @xmath49 .",
    "the heisenberg interaction on the tetrahedral units ( crossed plaquettes of the checkerboard lattice ) . a detailed study",
    "( wherein fractionalization and criticality were established ) of the klein model that results and fluctuations about it was undertaken in @xcite .",
    "some highlights of this study are shown in figs.([pr],[rules],[fig : pr1 ] ) . as highlighted in fig.([fig : pr1 ] ) , each dimer configuration corresponds to a system of continuous lines in the six - vertex representation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite    an operational definition of zero temperature topological quantum order ( tqo ) @xcite in degenerate systems goes as follows : given a set of @xmath50 orthonormal ground states @xmath51 , tqo exists iff for any bounded operator @xmath52 with compact support ( i.e. any quasi - local operator ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant and @xmath55 is a correction that is either zero or vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit . @xcite",
    "[ thus , in such systems , only non - local `` topological '' quantities can become items of interest . ] relying on our demonstration that the klein model only allows for singlet covering ground states ( and superpositions thereof ) and that a finite spectral gap appears , topological order on klein spin systems on the pyrochlore and checkerboard lattices follows . to see this",
    ", we note that , e.g. , on a checkerboard lattice in the sector of a fixed number of lines , imposed by boundary conditions , all states may be linked to each other by a sequence of local symmetry operations . such a local symmetry operation is shown in fig.([fig : pr1 ] ) . this emergent local ( @xmath56 @xcite ) gauge - like symmetry operation in a system with a gap mandates topological quantum order as proved in @xcite : glancing at eq.([tqo ] )",
    ", we note that as no local symmetry can be broken ( elitzur s theorem ) , @xcite @xcite all diagonal elements of a non - gauge invariant observable @xmath52 vanish while all gauge invariant observable @xmath52 are the same regardless of the state @xmath48 ; the presence of the gap mandates that the off - diagonal terms of eq.([tqo ] ) vanish .",
    "even though , in principle , local observables such @xmath57 ) depend on whether or not a dimer exists between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a given pure dimer state , e.g. latexmath:[$\\langle \\phi|",
    "\\vec{s}_{i } \\cdot \\vec{s}_{j }     singlet dimer between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 , such an operator unfortunately can not attain a non - zero value once infinitesimal symmetry restoring perturbations are introduced .",
    "this is similar to what occurs in a @xmath59 gauge theory given by the action @xmath60 with the product of gauge fields @xmath61 taken around the sides of a plaquette .",
    "( the gauge field @xmath62 resides on the link between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ) here , @xmath63 is different for different @xmath59 gauge configurations .",
    "however , by elitzur s theorem @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite similarly , in our case , @xmath65 just as local observables vanish in gauge theory due to a generalized elitzur s theorem applied to the non ( local ) symmetry invariant quantity @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite an intuitive understanding may be gained by mapping klein model ground states onto @xmath59 gauge theory ( @xmath66 ) ground states ; this ( non - invertible ) mapping proceeds by replacing a singlet dimer between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 within the klein model to a link with @xmath67 in a @xmath59 gauge theory .",
    "a complete treatment entails the presence of a transverse like field connecting the different dimer states ( similar to a transverse field in @xmath59 gauge theories , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the result generally follows from symmetry considerations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite the line number of the six vertex representation is a conserved topological charge in these systems .",
