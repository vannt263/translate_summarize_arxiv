    "despite decades of study our knowledge of the fundamental resonance spectrum of the nucleon is still incomplete . many resonance properties are uncertain and some resonances predicted to exist are yet to be observed .",
    "most predictions of the resonance spectrum are based on phenomenological models , such as the constituent quark model or the di - quark model , but lattice predictions directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are fast developing . experimental differentiation between these theoretical approaches based on the presently established resonance spectrum",
    "is , however , inconclusive due to the many `` missing '' and poorly established resonances . insufficient accuracy and quantity of observables",
    "obtained results in too many ambiguities and the famous case of the missing resonances in baryon spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "have they not yet been observed  or are they simply not there ?      a promising tool to learn about the resonance spectrum is the photoproduction of pions from nucleon targets , as many resonances are expected to couple to the pion decay channel and polarised real photons , with a well - understood electromagnetic interaction , provide a powerful probe .    in such pseudo - scalar meson production reactions",
    "the measurement of differential cross section , all three single - polarisation ( beam , target , recoil nucleon ) and a total of four well chosen double - polarisation observables has the potential to give the first model independent extraction of the production amplitudes .",
    "this will greatly enhance our capabilities to determine the nucleon excitation spectrum in a nearly model - independent way .",
    ". this effort is being carried out at various electron - beam facilities worldwide .",
    "one of the three single - polarisation observables , and a crucial one to constrain pwa s , is the beam asymmetry , @xmath0 , from linearly polarised photons : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the linear beam polarisation and @xmath6 is the angle between the reaction plane and the photon polarisation plane .",
    "data from the neutron is crucial in determining the resonance isospin and achieving a reliable extraction of the electromagnetic couplings of the excited states .",
    "the world dataset on the neutron , however , is extremely sparse , consisting of only three fixed - angle experiments limited to the 1.70 - 2.05 gev range in energy and 35@xmath7 - 90@xmath7 in scattering angle . @xcite@xmath3@xcite@xmath3@xcite .      a new , extensive photoproduction experiment using a polarised photon beam and",
    "a liquid deuterium target has been carried out at jefferson laboratory , virginia , usa , march - june 2007 .",
    "the experiment ran with both a circularly and a linearly polarised beam .",
    "the linear polarisation plane was flipped frequently between two orthogonal orientations , parallel and perpendicular to the lab floor .",
    "six photon energy settings were employed between 1.1 and 2.3 gev ( produced via coherent bremsstrahlung from an electron beam at 3.3 - 5.2 gev ) .",
    "a single charged particle trigger was used , yielding a total of @xmath8 events recorded .",
    "we present very preliminary measurements of @xmath0 from the analysis of the @xmath9 channel .",
    "jefferson laboratory is home to a 1.4 km race - track electron accelerator operating at energies up to 6 gev ( an upgrade to 12 gev is currently underway ) .",
    "200 @xmath10a of continuous current is split and delivered simultaneously to three experimental halls .",
    "our experiment was conducted in hall b , where the electron beam is passed through a diamond crystal emitting linearly polarised photons via the process of coherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "the scattered electrons are momentum analysed in the hall b photon tagging facility@xcite , which serves to `` tag '' the photons through a coincidence timing measurement between the deflected electrons and the event time in the detector .",
    "the target cell is positioned in the centre of clas .",
    "clas @xcite is a formidable multi - layer onion of detectors ( scintillators , drift chambers and calorimeters ) providing nearly full coverage in the azimuthal angle and from 8@xmath11 to 140@xmath11 in scattering angle ( lab frame ) which , combined with a toroidal magnetic field , offer excellent sensitivity to charged particles .",
    "the reaction of interest can be considered as quasi - free with a spectator proton : @xmath12 the following data cuts are then applied to obtain a first selection of the @xmath9 channel :    select two - particle events with particle masses of the @xmath13 and _ p _ in the final state .",
    "cut on `` missing mass '' of the recoiling system to be consistent with the mass of a spectator proton .",
    "select low `` missing momentum '' in the spectator system - below 0.15 gev / c .",
    "cut on _ p _ and @xmath13 being back - to - back in centre - of - mass system ( cms ) .",
    "the exact photon was identified through timing coincidence of the reaction in clas with the tagger .",
    "this is made possible by the bunched nature of the beam , which arrives at 2 ns intervals .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ asym_eq ] ) , the beam asymmetry is extracted from a @xmath14 fit to the @xmath6-distribution .",
    "@xmath6 is , as before , the angle between the reaction plane and the photon polarisation plane . to make the following simplification possible",
    ", we need to keep the plane from which we measure @xmath6 constant , so we choose to always measure from the horizontal polarisation plane , which is also the horizontal plane of clas in the lab frame . in order to reduce systematics ,",
    "the polarisation plane was rotated between two orthogonal directions during the experiment , with @xmath6 being always measured from the horizontal plane of clas , simplifying the expression thus ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the differential cross - section from ( [ asym_eq ] ) using a parallel beam polarisation and @xmath19 , consequently , a perpendicular polarisation .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath20 .",
    "calibrations are still underway , but a very preliminary evaluation of @xmath21 0.4@xmath22 of the data indicates a tiny statistical uncertainty ( fig .",
    "it is our goal to reduce systematics , which are currently very large , to @xmath21 5@xmath22 .",
    "4.7 cm    4.7 cm",
    "the determination of the beam asymmetry , @xmath0 , from a linearly polarised photon beam incident on a neutron ( in a liquid deuterium target ) is underway .",
    "early analysis shows that the data quality is good , statistical uncertainty is tiny and a sizeable asymmetry can be seen at backward angles .",
    "a full analysis is to follow soon in scattering angle range 20@xmath11 - 145@xmath11 ( in cms ) and entire photon energy range 1.1 - 2.3 gev .",
    "the measurement promises to greatly expand the sparse world data - set on the neutron and aid in constraining the determination of the reaction amplitudes in pion photoproduction thus providing strong constraints on the nucleon excitation spectrum .",
