    "progress made in realizing spin polarized electronic systems has led to recent proposals dealing with novel electronic devices , such as spin - transistors @xcite , spin - waveguides @xcite , spin - filters @xcite , quantum computers @xcite , etc . in recent years , spin - electronics ( or spintronics )",
    "has become an important and fast - growing research field in condensed matter physics and semiconductor electronics . at present , spintronic systems and devices",
    "have been realized on the basis of diluted magnetic semiconductors and narrow - gap semiconductor nanostructures . in the former case the spin degeneracy of the carriers",
    "are lifted by the presence of an external magnetic field and in the latter case the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction ( soi ) is introduced due to the innate features of the material systems .",
    "currently , one of the most important aspects in the field of spintronics is to investigate electronic systems with finite spin splitting in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "it has been realized that in narrow - gap semiconductor quantum well structures , the higher - than - usual zero - magnetic - field spin splitting ( or spontaneous spin splitting ) can be achieved by the inversion asymmetry of the microscopic confining potential due to the presence of the heterojunction @xcite .",
    "this kind of inversion asymmetry corresponds to an inhomogeneous surface electric field and , hence , this kind of spin - splitting is electrically equivalent to the rashba spin - splitting or rashba effect @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art material engineering and micro- and nano - fabrication techniques have made it possible to achieve experimentally observable rashba effect in , e.g. , inas- and ingaas - based two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems @xcite and gaas - based two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated very recently that a spin split 2dhg with relatively strong rashba effect can be realized in a gaas / algaas heterojunction grown a nominally undoped ( 311)a gaas substrate with a weak p - type background doping @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , in such a system a back gate can be applied to control the strength of the soi in the device @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the effect of soi on electronic and transport properties of 2degs and 2dhgs has been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically . at present ,",
    "one of the most powerful and most popularly used experimental methods to identify the rashba spin splitting in 2deg and 2dhg systems is magneto - transport measurements carried out at quantizing magnetic fields and low - temperatures at which the shubnikov - de hass ( sdh ) oscillations are observable @xcite . from the periodicity and profile of the sdh oscillations , the carrier density in different spin branches together with the rashba parameter can be determined experimentally . however , in gaas - based 2dhg systems , because the holes are much heavier than electrons , the magneto - transport measurements can only be applied to study the rashba spin - splitting in the low - density samples @xcite , otherwise very high magnetic fields are required in order to observe the sdh oscillations .",
    "the experimental data showed that a stronger rashba effect of the 2dhg can be achieved in a sample with a larger hole density @xcite .",
    "thus , optical measurements ( e.g. , optical absorption and transmission , raman spectrum , ultrafast pump - and - probe experiments , etc . ) become one of the realistic options in determining the spintronic properties in the high - density 2dhgs .",
    "furthermore , at present , most of the published work in the field of spintronics is focused on electronic and transport properties of 2degs and 2dhgs in the presence of soi . in order to apply the optical experiments to identify the rashba effect , to explore further applications of the spintronic systems as optical devices and to achieve a deeper understanding of these novel material systems , it is essential and necessary to examine the effects of soi on elementary electronic excitation from a typical 2dhg and it becomes the prime motivation of the present theoretical study .",
    "it is well known that in an electron or a hole gas system , the electronic transitions through spin- and charge - density oscillations can result in a collective excitation associated with plasmon oscillation modes .",
    "the spintronic materials can therefore provide us an ideal device system in examining how electronic many - body effects are affected by the soi . in this paper , we consider an interacting 2dhg where soi is induced by the rashba effect .",
    "one of our aims is to obtain the modes of the elementary electronic excitation such as plasmons and to examine the unique features of these excitation modes .",
    "very recently , the plasmon modes induced by intra- and inter - so electronic transition in ingaas - based 2deg systems in the presence of the rashba effect have been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "it was found that the inter - so transition can result in optic - like plasmon oscillations in a spin - split 2deg and these plasmon modes can be used to identify the rashba spin - splitting . on the basis that there is a significant difference of the rashba spin - splitting in ingaas - based 2degs and in gaas - based 2dhgs , it is of value to study the consequence of different types of soi in different spintronic systems such as spin - split 2dhgs .",
    "furthermore , we would like to take this opportunity to present more detailed theoretical approaches used to study many - body effects in a 2deg or 2dhg system in the presence of soi .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study spin - dependent carrier distribution along with several single - particle aspects for a spin split 2dhg in a gaas - based structure . in section",
    "iii , the effects of the soi on dielectric function matrix and plasmon excitation are investigated analytically using a simple and standard many - body theory .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are presented and discussed in section iv and the concluding remarks are summarized in section v.",
    "it has been shown that for the case of a spin - spilt hole gas system , such as a p - doped algaas / gaas heterostructure , the effective soi due to the rashba effect can be obtained from , e.g. , a @xmath0 band - structure calculation @xcite . in gaas - based quantum well structures with p - type doping ,",
    "the heavy holes dominate and the effects of light holes can be neglected @xcite . in this case the treatment of the spintronic properties for heavy holes can follow closely those for electrons @xcite . for a typical 2dhg formed in the @xmath1-plane and its growth - direction taken along the @xmath2-axis in semiconductor quantum wells , the single - particle hamiltonian , including the lowest order of soi involving the heavy holes , is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hole effective mass , @xmath5 with @xmath6 is the momentum operator , @xmath7 is the @xmath8 unit matrix , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the pauli spin matrices , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the confining potential of the 2dhg along the growth direction , and @xmath14 is the rashba parameter which measures the strength of the soi .",
    "this hamiltonian is therefore a @xmath8 matrix and the soi does not affect the hole states along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation are readily obtained , in the form of a row vector , as @xmath15 e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r } } \\psi_n ( z ) .",

    ". the energy spectrum of the 2dhg becomes @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) , the hole wavefunction @xmath21 and subband energy @xmath22 along the growth - direction are determined by a spin - independent schrdinger equation . from the hole energy spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) , one can immediately see that in the presence of soi , the energy dispersion of a 2dhg is not parabolic anymore and the energy levels for the @xmath23 spin branches depend strongly on hole wavevector ( or momentum ) .",
    "these features are in sharp contrast to those for a spin - degenerate 2deg or 2dhg .",
    "furthermore , it is known @xcite that for a spin - split 2deg , the electron wavefunction and energy spectrum are given respectively by @xmath24e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r}}\\psi_n(z)$ ] and @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the rashba parameter for a 2deg .",
    "thus , in contrast to a linear - in-@xmath27 dependence of the energy separation between two spin branches in a spin split 2deg , the rashba effect on a 2dhg results in a cubic - in-@xmath27 term of the hole energy spectrum .",
    "this is the essential difference between a 2deg and a 2dhg in the presence of soi , which leads to different density - of - states and , consequently , to different spintronic properties in a 2deg and a 2dhg .",

    "( [ h2 ] ) , the green s function and the corresponding density - of - states ( dos ) for a 2dhg with soi can be obtained easily . due to energy difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the dos for holes in the ` @xmath39 ' branch is always larger than that in the ` + ' branch and , as a result , the hole density in the ` @xmath39 ' channel is always larger than that in the ` + ' channel .",
    "applying the dos to the condition of hole number conservation , for the case of a narrow - width quantum well in which only the lowest hole subband is present ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) and at a low - temperature limit ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , the hole density @xmath42 in the spin channel @xmath43 can be obtained by solving @xmath44 = 0 \\label{hh4}\\ ] ] for case of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the total hole density of the 2dhg system and @xmath47 . when @xmath48 , only the ` @xmath39 ' spin branch is occupied by holes and , therefore , the system is fully spin - polarized ( i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the condition @xmath51 can only be satisfied in a device system with very high hole density and very large rashba parameter , which has not yet been realized experimentally .",

    "these spintronic systems then can be used as optical devices such as tunable sub - thz light generators and photon detectors .    in the presence of soi , the hole wavefunction and energy spectrum in a 2dhg differ significantly from those in a 2deg . as a result , the hole distribution in different spin branches and the corresponding plasmon excitation modes in a 2dhg depend differently on the total hole density from those in a 2deg on the total electron density .",
    "these theoretical results can be helpful in designing optical devices based on spintronic materials . finally , we suggest that the important and interesting theoretical predications merit attempts at experimental verification .        one of us ( w. x. ) is a research fellow of the australian research council .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of the elementary electronic excitation associated with plasmon modes in a two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) in the presence of spin - orbit ( so ) interaction induced by the rashba effect . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is carried out using a standard random - phase - approximation approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in such a spintronic system , plasmon excitation can be achieved via intra- and inter - so electronic transitions around the fermi level . as a result , the intra- and inter - so plasmon modes can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the plasmon modes induced by inter - so transition are optic - like and these modes can be directly applied to identify the rashba spin splitting in 2dhg systems through optical measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting features of the plasmon excitation in a spin split 2dhg are analyzed and discussed in details . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the results obtained for a 2dhg are compared with those obtained for a spin - splitting 2deg reported very recently . </S>"
