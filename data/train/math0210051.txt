    "nothing interesting can be said concerning orchard properties of such a class since removal of a point changes the orchard relation dramatically .",

    "add now a new point @xmath97 very close to @xmath96 in the interior of one of the two chosen opposite cones .",

    "the configuration @xmath135 has then orchard partition @xmath136 .",
    "there are of course many more constructions .",
    "let us close this section by mentioning another one :    given a monochromatic configuration @xmath4 having an odd number of points , add generically two infinitesimally - close points @xmath77 .",

    "only the new points @xmath140 might be outside this class . in this case , shift them along @xmath141 into a suitable position .",

    "[ even_polygon ] the same argument shows that vertices of a convex polygon with @xmath146 edges have alternating colours .",
    "another monochromatic family can be described as follows :    the following configuration @xmath4 of @xmath146 points is monochromatic for @xmath147 : consider @xmath2 vertices spanning a regular polygon @xmath96 ( any convex polygon will in fact work ) having @xmath2 sides .",
    "add @xmath2 more points which are interior to @xmath96 and very close to the midpoints of all edges in @xmath96 ( figure [ family2_example ] displays the example @xmath148 ) .",

    "the points @xmath15 and @xmath97 are separated by exactly one of the two extra lines mentioned above and hence we have @xmath155 too .",
