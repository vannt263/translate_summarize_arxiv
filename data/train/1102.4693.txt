    "the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics suffers from the hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the planck scale .",
    "extending the sm through supersymmetry ( susy ) is a very promising solution @xcite .",
    "the new supersymmetric particles must then have masses of order 1 tev .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetric particles can contribute to low - energy observables via radiative quantum corrections .",
    "in fact , susy models provide an excellent fit to the extensive data , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "the fits generically prefer a light susy spectrum , typically below 1tev .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern have so far analyzed 35pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity at 7  tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "a total integrated luminosity of 1 to 7  fb@xmath0 can realistically be achieved at this energy through 2012 .",
    "these data will significantly extend the search reach for susy  @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric sm has 124 free parameters .",
    "however , current precision observables and direct search limits only provide sensitivity to very restricted susy models with a small number of parameters , like minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite which only has 5 free parameters beyond those of the sm . in the following , we thus focus on msugra models .",
    "specifically , they are characterized by a common supersymmetric scalar mass @xmath1 , a common gaugino mass @xmath2 , a universal trilinear coupling @xmath3 , the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath4 , and the sign of the higgs mixing mass parameter ,  sign@xmath5 .    at the lhc , supersymmetry can be searched for in channels with jets , leptons and missing transverse energy  .",
    "studies by atlas and cms reveal that squarks and gluinos with masses up to about 700gev could be discovered at 7tev energy and 1fb@xmath0 integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "if no signal is found , one can significantly constrain supersymmetric models and exclude squarks and gluinos with masses close to 1  tev .    to obtain consistent limits on the susy parameter space and the resulting mass spectrum in the absence of a susy signal at the lhc",
    ", one needs to combine potential lhc exclusion limits and current low energy precision observables in a global fit . in the following we employ the fittino framework @xcite to study such a scenario",
    "we follow the fittino analysis in ref.@xcite and consider the following set of low - energy observables and existing collider limits in light of the msugra model : _ ( i ) _ rare decays of b- and k - mesons ; _ ( ii ) _ the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath6 ; _ ( iii ) _ electroweak precision measurements from lep , slc and the tevatron and the higgs boson mass limit from lep ; and _ ( iv ) _  the relic density of cold dark matter in the universe , @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , we employ the program higgsbounds @xcite and not a rigid higgs mass limit .",
    "we refer to ref.@xcite for a detailed discussion of the low - energy inputs and the collider limits .    at the lhc ,",
    "the most stringent limits on supersymmetric models with @xmath8-parity conservation can be expected from searches in channels with jets , leptons and missing transverse energy , @xmath9 .",

    "note that a positive sign of @xmath33 is preferred to describe the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , so we have fixed sign@xmath46 and determined @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from the fit . including the @xmath47 uncertainty , we find @xmath48gev , @xmath49gev , @xmath50gev and @xmath51 , in good agreement with ref.@xcite .",

    "the area below the curves can be excluded at 95%  cl . we assign 30% systematic uncertainty to the susy signal cross - section , and 20% systematic uncertainty to the background event rate in the signal - enriched region , which is dominantly electroweak  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding sparticle mass spectrum is presented in fig.[fig : leo_and_lhc_mass.eps ] and features most probable squark and gluino masses beyond 1  tev .",
    "an lhc exclusion in the zero - lepton , four - jet plus @xmath57 channel is mainly sensitive to the squark and gluino masses and would drive @xmath1 and @xmath2 to larger values .",
    "the low - energy precision observables and the relic density , on the other hand , are mainly constraining the masses of colour - neutral sparticles .",
    "supersymmetric models with common scalar and gaugino masses like msugra connect these two , leading to a tension between the two sets of observables .",
    "in addition , for larger @xmath1 and @xmath2 both @xmath58 and @xmath7 require an increased @xmath4 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the global fit allows areas in the susy parameter space at 95%  cl , which are located in the region of 95% cl exclusion of the lhc , see fig.[fig : leo_and_lhc ] .",
    "this is due to the weak dependence of the lhc contribution to the @xmath26 on @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 below the direct lhc limit allow for a significantly better @xmath26 from the low energy data , compensating the contribution from the lhc .",

    "[ fig : leo_and_lhc_mass.eps ]    fig.[fig : leo_and_lhc_squarks ] presents the impact of the lhc exclusions on the @xmath59 and @xmath60 mass spectrum from the global msugra fit , assuming 35pb@xmath0 , and 1 , 2 and 7fb@xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : leo_and_lhc_squarks ]    already with 1fb@xmath0 the lhc exclusion would push the lower limit on the squark mass above the tev - scale .",
    "the @xmath60 mass , which is mainly determined from the low - energy observables , is predicted in the range between 300gev and 500gev .",
    "note that a combined msugra fit without the constraints on @xmath58 and @xmath7 results in very large sparticle mass uncertainties .",
    "we have presented a first global msugra analysis of supersymmetric models which includes the current low - energy precision measurements , the dark matter relic density as well as potential lhc exclusion limits from direct susy searches in the zero - lepton plus jets and missing transverse energy channel .",
    "we conclude that it is , in principle , possible to reconcile the supersymmetric description of low - energy observables and the dark matter relic density with a non - observation of supersymmetry in the first phase of the lhc , despite some tension building up in a combined fit within the msugra framework .",
    "moreover , we find that a global msugra fit including potential lhc exclusion limits would yield lower bounds on squark and gluino masses of about 1tev already with 1fb@xmath0 integrated lhc luminosity .    while our study is exploratory in the sense that it is based on one search channel only , and on a simplified description of the lhc detectors , it clearly demonstrates the potential of the first phase of lhc running at 7tev in 2011/12 to constrain supersymmetric models and the sparticle mass spectrum .",
