    "the formation of cooper pairs in a superconductor is essential for superconductivity @xcite@xcite .",
    "cooper pairs are of bosonic nature , and it is believed that they generate a supercurrent in the same mechanism as helium atoms generate a superflow .",
    "it is clear that , once the cooper pairs in a superconductor are broken , superconductivity will be lost .",
    "an intersting question is that , can the system become dissipative without the breaking of cooper pairs ?    from the view point of many - body physics , one can see there is a rather striking difference between the origin of cooper pairs and the origin of superconductivity .",
    "cooper pairs is due to some _ attractive _ interactions between fermions , while superconductivity , like superfluidity , has something to do with _ repulsive _ interactions between its composing bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ , the cooper pairs @xcite@xcite .",
    "this difference implies that the physical regime of cooper pairs is not exactly the same as that of superconductivity .",
    "we suggest that , under some circumstances , cooper pairs are not broken when one increases a supercurrent to above critical current .",
    "we shall also show that , at the above - critical current region , the electrical resistance , caused by the scattering of cooper pair , has a different temperature dependence from the case where the charge carriers of the current are fermions ( electrons or holes ) .",
    "thus the existence of cooper pairs can be signified by the temperature behavior of the resistance .",
    "is the superconducting region where there are metastable current - carrying states corresponding to the local minima of the curve ; region @xmath0 is dissipative without metastable states .",
    "the many - body eigen energy states at region @xmath1 can be mapped to the states at region @xmath0 by galileo transformation .",
    ", width=288 ]    like the case of superfluidity @xcite@xcite@xcite , the dissipative behavior of a superconductor above a critical current @xmath2 , can be explained naturally in terms of the many - body dispersion spectrum @xmath3 of the charge carrier system ( @xmath3 is the lowest eigen energy at given current @xmath4 ) . beyond @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath3 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] ) , thus a current can continuously lose its energy and momentum to the environment , corresponding to a dissipative decay process .",
    "this is contrast to the case in the @xmath5 regime where the supercurrents are metastable states , corresponding to the local minima of the @xmath3 curve , whose decay is prevented by the energy barriers among the minima .",
    "the dissipation mechanism illustrated above does not involves breaking of cooper pairs .",
    "moreover , the low - lying eigen energy states below @xmath2 can be galileo boosted to generate the low - lying states above @xmath2 @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "the galileo boost , also could being viewed as center - of - mass - mention transformation , does not modify the inner structure of the states such as pair correlations .",
    "thus , the cooper pairs , present in states below @xmath2 , survive the boost and exist in the states above @xmath2 @xcite .    in literature , landau s criterion of a superconductor",
    "is generally used for the analysis of transitional regime , which determines a critical velocity to be @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the pairing gap and @xmath8 is the fermi momentum .",
    "landau s criterion requires an exchange of a quantum , with a large momentum ( the order of @xmath8 ) and with a certain energy , between the superconducting charges and its environment .",
    "however , this exchange process could be inhibited for that the spectrum of the environment may generally be incompatible to absorb such an unusual quantum .    in a superconductor ,",
    "the self - induced magnetic field of the supercurrent could lead to loss of superconductivity by breaking cooper pairs , ( _ i.e. _ , silsbee effect @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", there is an external critical current determined by the critical magentic field , and the cooper pairs do not exist above critical current . however , silsbee effect can be largely reduced by alignment of the currents and their geometries ( see fig .  [ currentalignment ] ) , thus one might be able to obtain an intrinsic critical supercurrent , like the case of superfluid @xmath9he , and reach a dissipative regime without breaking cooper pairs",
    ". we shall assume the existence of cooper pairs above critical current in follows .     to weaken the silsbee effect ,",
    "four thin superconducting films are used to carry the current .",
    "film i is on top of film ii , and film iii on top of film iv .",
    "film i is in the same plane of film iii , and film ii in the same plane of film iv .",
    "current in the film i ( blue arrow ) points to the same direction as to the current in film iv ( red arrow ) , while the currents in the film ii ( red arrow ) and film iv ( blue arrow ) point to the opposite direction .",
    ", width=288 ]",
    "the eletrical resistance in a superconductor above @xmath2 and below @xmath10 is mainly caused by the scattering properties of cooper pairs with phonons .",
    "we shall discuss the temperature behavior of the resistance .",
    "for simplicity , we assume physical properties of the superconductor are isotropic .",
    "first , we consider the dispersion relation of a cooper pair .",
    "the dispersion is linear at small momentum @xmath11 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 ( we approximate @xmath13 by the critical velocity of the supercurrent @xmath14 ) . at large @xmath15 ,",
    "the energy of a cooper pair is approximately @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of a cooper pair assumed to be @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the mass of an electron ) . a general form of dispersion @xmath20 can be used for approximation for all @xmath15 values @xcite .",
    "we consider the leading scattering process in which one phonon is adsorbed or emitted by a cooper pair ( see fig [ onephonon ] ) .",
    "the total energy and momentum should be conserved ,",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the momentum of a cooper pair before ( after ) the scattering , @xmath25 is the momentum of the phonon , @xmath26 is the sound velocity , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) corresponds to the emission ( absorption ) of the phonon .        combining eq .",
    "1 , eq . 2 and eq . 3 , one gets , latexmath:[\\[\\sqrt{v_c^2 q_1 ^ 2 + ( q_1 ^ 2/4 m_e)^2 } =   \\sqrt{v_c^2 q_1 ^ 2 + ( q_1 ^ 2/4 m_e)^2 } \\pm \\hbar c_s      in most superconductors , @xmath14 , can being estimated using critical current density @xcite , is roughly the orders of ten meters per second or below .",
    "thus @xmath14 is orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "one then can realize that unless the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) in the phonon emission ( absorption ) process is roughly equal or larger than @xmath32 , eq .",
    "4 can not be satisfied . for a cooper pair with a momentum of @xmath33 ,",
    "the energy is roughly @xmath34 and the corresponding temperature is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "thus at low temperature @xmath37 , one - phonon scattering process is absent , and the scattering process of cooper pairs must involve at least two phonons .",
    "one can invoke boltzmann transport equation to determine the temperature dependence of resistance of the cooper pair system .",
    "however , unlike the case of a fermionic system where the existence of fermi surface and pauli blocking are essential , the analysis of the ( bosonic ) cooper pair system can be simplified . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the one - phonon scattering process can bring the momentum of a cooper pair ( with an energy of @xmath39 or less ) to zero or to the opposite direction , thus effectively causing the dissipation of the current .",
    "the probability of one phonon process in low temperature is proportional to @xmath40 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , thus the resistance @xmath41 is linear in @xmath40 . at @xmath42 , one can find that probability of two - phonons process is proportional to @xmath43 , thus @xmath44 . in metals where temperature dependence of resistance is determined by electron phonon scattering , the power law of @xmath45 at low temperature is different , with an exponent being 5 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "thus one can distinguish between cooper pairs and electrons by checking the powering law of @xmath45 in the above critical current regime .    in the so called strange metal phase of some high-@xmath10 cuprates",
    ", the resistance has also a linear temperature dependence .",
    "one might wildly speculate that this linear behavior could be caused by the scattering of cooper pairs . in order for this speculation to be valid",
    ", cooper pairs shall exist above @xmath10 in some systems .",
    "an example is that cold fermi atom gases which can be tuned to go through bcs - bec crossover . in the bec side , the binding energy of cooper pairs ( or molecules )",
    "can be orders of magnitude larger than superfluid transition temperature @xmath10 , since @xmath10 can be made small by decreasing the density of atom gases .",
    "we suggest that , under some circumstance , cooper pairs could exist in a superconductor above critical current , and the system has a different power law of @xmath45 from the case where electrons are current carriers .                in superconductors ,",
    "galileo invariance is not exact but is a good approximation when the center of mass motion is not large .",
    "there might be some possibility that the dispersion energy of normal state ( without pairing ) could be smaller than the dispersion energy of pairing state within a current regime somewhere between @xmath46 and the first supercurrent , we ignore this case here .",

    "see x. g. wen , quantum field theory of many - body systems ( oxford university press , london , 2004 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath14 using @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the critical current density , @xmath49 is the density of cooper pairs , @xmath50 is the charge of a cooper pair .",
    "we assume that all conducting electrons are paired up , thus @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the density of electrons ."
