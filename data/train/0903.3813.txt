    "non - local electric effects have been observed since the early days of mesoscopic physics , e.g. in metallic circuits@xcite .",
    "this fact is related to the primarily non - local nature of electronic wave functions in quantum coherent conductors .",
    "the spin - degree of freedom has raised little attention in this context , although its control and detection is one of the major challenges of nanophysics , nowadays .",
    "non - local spin signals have been studied for multi - terminal metallic conductors@xcite , semiconductors@xcite and graphene@xcite , in the multichannel diffusive incoherent ( mdi ) regime .",
    "it has been found that a non - equilibrium spin accumulation induced by a ferromagnet into a given conductor can be detected as a voltage across the interface between this conductor and another ferromagnet@xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , spin - dependent non local effects have not been investigated in the coherent regime , so far .",
    "carbon - nanotubes - based circuits are appealing candidates for observing a non - local , spin - dependent , and coherent behavior of electrons .",
    "first , electronic transport in carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) can reach the few - channels ballistic regime , as suggested by the observation of fabry - perot - like interference patterns@xcite .",
    "secondly , spin injection has already been demonstrated in cnts connected to two ferromagnetic leads ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "thirdly , non local voltages have been observed in cnts contacted to four normal - metal leads@xcite , which suggests that electrons can propagate in the nanotube sections below the contacts .",
    "the study of non - local spin transport in cnts has recently triggered some experimental efforts@xcite .",
    "however , a theoretical insight on this topic is lacking . some major questions to address are what are the signatures of a non - local and spin - dependent behavior of electrons in a nanoconductor , and to",
    "which extent these signatures are specific to the coherent regime or the few - channels case .     studied in this article . the central conductor ( represented with the grey bar )",
    "is contacted to two normal metal leads @xmath0 and two ferromagnetic leads @xmath1 , which can be magnetized in parallel ( @xmath2 ) or antiparallel ( @xmath3 ) configurations .",
    "the only difference between setups ( a ) and ( b ) is the position of the two @xmath1 leads .",
    "contacts 1 and 2 are used as source and drain to measure a local conductance @xmath4and contacts 3 and 4 are used to probe a non - local voltage @xmath5 outside the classical current path .",
    "right : tables presenting the behaviors of setups ( a ) and ( b ) in various regimes .",
    "we study the existence of the signals @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we compare the predictions of the coherent four - channels model ( cfc ) of section [ scatmodel ] , the incoherent four - channels model ( ifc ) of section [ ifc ] and the multichannel diffusive incoherent ( mdi ) model of section [ mdi ] . ]    in this paper , we study the behavior of a cnt with two normal metal ( @xmath0 ) leads and two ferromagnetic ( @xmath1 ) leads magnetized in colinear directions .",
    "two leads are used as source and drain to define a local conductance @xmath9and the other two are used to probe a non - local voltage @xmath5 outside the classical current path .",
    "we consider two different setups which differ on the positions of the @xmath1 leads .",
    "setup ( a ) corresponds to the standard geometry used for the study of the mdi limit . in setup ( b ) , the two @xmath1 leads play the role of the voltage probes , so that no magnetic response is allowed in the mdi limit .",
    "we mainly focus on the coherent regime , using a scattering description with two transverse modes , to account for the twofold orbital degeneracy commonly observed in cnts@xcite .",
    "this minimal description is appropriate at low temperatures and bias voltages .",
    "we take into account both the spin - polarization of the tunneling probabilities at the ferromagnetic contacts and the spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) which has been shown to affect significantly spin - dependent transport in the two - terminals case@xcite .",
    "this approach leads to strong qualitative differences with the mdi case .",
    "in particular , we find a magnetic signal in the conductance @xmath10 of setups ( a ) and ( b ) , which would not occur in the mdi limit .",
    "we also predict an unprecedented magnetic signal in @xmath5 for setup ( b ) .",
    "we find that these effects already arise in the incoherent few channels regime .",
    "however , they are much stronger in the coherent case , due to resonances which occur inside the cnt .",
    "these resonances make the circuit sensitive to the sdips , which can furthermore enhance the amplitude of the magnetic signals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii defines setups ( a ) and ( b ) , section iii discusses the multichannel diffusive incoherent ( mdi ) limit , section iv focuses on the coherent  four - channels ( cfc ) scattering description , section v presents an incoherent four - channels ( ifc ) description , section vi discusses the experimental results presently available , and section vii concludes .",
    "in this article , we consider a central conductor ( cc ) connected to an ensemble @xmath11 of two ferromagnetic ( @xmath1 ) and two normal metal ( @xmath0 ) reservoirs .",
    "we study the two configurations presented in fig .",
    "[ circuits ] . in both cases ,",
    "lead 1 is connected to a bias voltage source @xmath12 , lead 2 is connected to ground , whereas leads 3 and 4 are left floating . the only difference between setups ( a ) and ( b ) is the position of the two @xmath1 leads .",
    "these @xmath1 leads can be magnetized in parallel ( @xmath2 ) or antiparallel ( @xmath3 ) configurations .",
    "we will study the conductance @xmath13 between contacts 1 and 2 and the voltage drop @xmath5 between leads 3 and 4 .",
    "the dependence of these quantities on the magnetic configuration @xmath14 of the ferromagnetic electrodes can be characterized with the magnetic signals @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "we first briefly discuss the behavior of setups ( a ) and ( b ) in the multichannel diffusive incoherent ( mdi ) regime .",
    "this case has been thoroughly investigated , in relation with experiments in which the cc is a metallic island@xcite . for a theoretical description of this regime , one can use spin - currents and a spin - dependent electrochemical potential @xmath15 which obey a local spin - dependent ohm s law , provided the mean free path in the sample is much shorter than the spin - flip length .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .   for a detailed justification of this approach from the boltzmann equations , and to ref .   for an overview of this field of research . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the behaviors expected for setups ( a ) and ( b ) in the mdi limit ( see appendix a for a short derivation of these results from a resistors model ) . a finite current between leads 1 and 2 can lead to a spin accumulation ( i.e. @xmath16 ) in the cc if lead 1 or 2 is ferromagnetic , because spins are injected into and extracted from the cc  with different rates in this case .",
    "the spin accumulation diffuses along the cc beyond lead 2 , and reaches leads 3 and 4 , provided the spin - flip length is sufficiently long .",
    "then , leads @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be used to detect the spin accumulation provided one of them is ferromagnetic .",
    "indeed , a local unbalance @xmath19 in the cc will produce a voltage drop between the floating lead @xmath20 and the cc if @xmath21 is ferromagnetic ( this voltage drops aims at equilibrating the spin currents between the cc and the ferromagnetic contact ) .",
    "one can thus conclude that in setup ( a ) , a spin accumulation occurs when @xmath22 , which leads to @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , one finds @xmath24 in setup ( b ) because a current flow between the @xmath0 leads 1 and 2 can not produce any spin accumulation . for completeness , we also mention that in the mdi limit , one finds @xmath25 for both setups ( a ) and ( b ) , due to the fact that leads 3 and 4 are left floating ( see appendix a ) .",

    "in this section , we study the case where the cc is a ballistic carbon nanotube ( cnt ) allowing coherent transport .",
    "the observation of fabry - perot like interference patterns@xcite suggests that it is possible , with certain type of metallic contacts , to neglect electronic interactions inside cnts .",

    "the table in fig .",
    "[ circuits ] summarizes these results .",
    "in order to determine whether the specific spin - dependent behavior of the cfc model is due to coherence or to the low number of channels , it is interesting to consider the incoherent four - channels ( ifc ) limit . if the phase relaxation length of the cnt is much shorter than the distance between the different contacts , the global transmission and reflection probabilities of setups ( a ) and ( b ) can be calculated by composing the scattering probabilities of the different contacts instead of the scattering amplitudes@xcite . we have checked that this leads to replacing the scattering probabilities @xmath191 occurring in eqs.([i ] ) and ( [ gdef ] ) by @xmath192 .",
    "importantly , this description remains intrinsically quantum since the channel quantization is taken into account . in figs .",
    "[ compsdips ] and [ setupb ] , we show with black and red dotted lines the ifc values corresponding to the different cfc curves .",
    "we find that @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not depend anymore on the phases @xmath193 .",
    "however , @xmath190 is still possible for setups ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "more precisely , we have checked analytically that using identical @xmath78 and @xmath79 modes leads to@xcite @xmath25 , and we have checked numerically that @xmath190 occurs in case of a @xmath78/@xmath79 asymmetry at one of the four contacts for setup ( a ) , and at contacts 1 or 2 for setup ( b ) .",
    "we can also obtain @xmath186 and @xmath187 for setup ( b ) [ and , more trivially , for setup ( a ) ] , with the same symmetry restrictions as for the cfc case ( see table in fig . [ circuits ] ) .",
    "therefore , having @xmath186 and @xmath187 for setup ( b ) , and @xmath194 for setups ( a ) and ( b ) is not a specificity the coherent case : using a very small number of transport channels already allows these properties .",
    "it is nevertheless important to notice that the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are strongly enhanced in the cfc case , due to resonance effects .",
    "moreover , in the ifc case , the circuit is insensitive to the sdips , whereas in the coherent case , the sdips furthermore increases the amplitude of @xmath47 and @xmath46@xcite . at last , the coherent case presents the interest of allowing strong variations of the electric signals with the gate - controlled phases @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "reference   reports on a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) circuit biased like in fig .",
    "[ circuits ] , but with four ferromagnetic leads .",
    "a hysteretic @xmath5 has been measured by flipping sequentially the magnetizations of the two inner contacts .",
    "however , no conclusion can be drawn from this experiment , due to the lack of information on the conduction regime followed by the device .",
    "reference reports on @xmath5 measurements for a setup ( a ) made with a swnt .",
    "the authors of this ref . have observed a finite @xmath5 which oscillates around zero while the back gate voltage of the sample is swept .",
    "this suggests that this experiment was in the coherent regime .",
    "however , the amplitude of @xmath5 was very low ( @xmath195 ) , which indicates , in the framework of the scattering model , that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 modes were very close and the spin polarization of the contacts scattering properties very weak .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that these authors did not obtain a measurable @xmath47 signal .",
    "although setup ( a ) seems very popular in the nanospintronics community for historical reasons @xcite , we have shown above that setup ( b ) also highly deserves an experimental effort , as well as @xmath46 measurements in general .    in this article , we have chosen to focus on the case of double mode quantum wires because this is adapted for describing cnt based devices , which are presently among the most advanced nanospintronics devices .",
    "however , technological progress might offer the opportunity to observe the effects depicted in this article in other types of nanowires , like e.g. semiconducting nanowires .",
    "indeed , quantum interferences have already been observed in @xcite and quantum wires@xcite , and spin - injection has already been demonstrated in layers @xcite and quantum dots@xcite .",
    "one major difficulty may consist in reaching the few modes and fully ballistic@xcite regime with these devices .",
    "in this work , we have studied theoretically various circuits consisting of a carbon nanotube with two transverse modes , contacted to two normal metal leads and two ferromagnetic leads .",
    "two contacts are used as source and drain to define a local conductance , and the two other contacts are left floating , to define a non - local voltage outside the classical current path .",
    "when the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic contacts are changed from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration , we predict , in the local conductance and the non - local voltage , magnetic signals which are specific to the case of a system with a low number of channels . in particular , we propose an arrangement of the normal and ferromagnetic leads [ setup ( b ) ] which would give no magnetic response in the multichannel diffusive incoherent ( mdi ) limit , but which allows magnetic responses in both the local conductance and the non - local voltage in the two - modes regime . the more traditional arrangement [ setup ( a ) ] used for the study of the mdi limit",
    "also shows a qualitatively new behavior , i.e. a magnetic response in the local conductance .",
    "these specific magnetic behaviors are strongly reinforced in the coherent case , due to resonance effects occurring inside the nanotube , and also , possibly , due to the spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts .",
    "our calculations pave the way to new experiments on non - local spin - transport in low - dimensional conductors .",
    "we acknowledge discussions with h. u. baranger and g. e. w. bauer .",
    "this work was financially supported by the anr-05-nano-055 contract , the european union contract fp6-ist-021285 - 2 and the cnano ile de france contract spinmol .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the mdi regime with an elementary but insightful resistors network model . when the electronic mean free path is much shorter than the spin - flip length , it is possible to define a spin - dependent electrochemical potential which obeys a local spin - dependent ohm s law@xcite .",
    "thus , neglecting spin - flip scattering inside the cc , one can use the effective resistor network of fig .",
    "[ resistances.eps ] to describe the behaviors of setups ( a ) and ( b ) in the mdi limit@xcite . for completeness , we allow the four leads @xmath111 to be ferromagnetic , with colinear magnetizations .",

    "the value of @xmath221 is independent from the contacts magnetic configuration , but @xmath222 depends on the relative configuration of leads @xmath72 and @xmath77 , so that @xmath190 is possible provided leads @xmath72 and @xmath77 are ferromagnetic .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath10 is independent from the magnetization directions of leads @xmath17 or @xmath18 because , due to @xmath223 , the resistors @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 of fig .",

    "importantly , these results will not be modified if a moderate intra - cc spin - flip scattering or the finite width of the contacts is taken into account , because both features can be modelled with a distributed array of resistors connecting the two spin branches , which will not change the spin symmetry of the model of fig .",
