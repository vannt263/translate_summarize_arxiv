    "in recent times , mapping projects of the world wide web ( www ) and the physical internet have offered the first chance to study topology and traffic of large - scale networks .",
    "the study of large scale networks , however , faces us with an array of new challenges .",
    "the definitions of centrality , hierarchies and structural organizations are in particular hindered by the large size of the systems and the complex interplay of engineering , traffic , geographical , and economical attributes characterizing their construction .    in this paper",
    "we propose the @xmath0-core decomposition as a graph analysis tool able to highlight interesting structural properties that are not captured by the degree distribution or other simple topological measures.the @xmath0-core decomposition  @xcite consists in identifying particular subsets of the network , called @xmath0-cores , each one obtained by a recursive pruning strategy .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition therefore provides a probe to study the hierarchical properties of large scale networks , focusing on the network s regions of increasing centrality and connectedness properties .",
    "more central cores are indeed more strongly connected , with larger number of possible distinct paths between vertices : this allows to obtain not only more robust routing properties but also a better opportunity to find a path with specific quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "here we study a set of basic network models and the as level internet maps obtained in two large scale measurement projects using very different techniques .",
    "we first characterize the @xmath0-core structure of real internet maps and compare with the structure obtained in the various models .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-core structure is extremely different in light tailed and heavy - tailed networks and is able to clearly discriminate among various models presented in the literature . in this perspective",
    "the @xmath0-core analysis represents a useful tool in the model validation process .",
    "moreover , any result concerning internet maps has to consider their incompleteness and the presence of measurements biases .",
    "for this reason we also present a study of the stability of the @xmath0-core analysis in the presence of biases and incomplete sampling in all the network models considered .",
    "our findings indicate that the @xmath0-core decomposition s fingerprints allow the discrimination between heterogeneous and homogeneous topologies even after an incomplete sampling : this shows that the signatures observed in the as internet maps are qualitatively reliable , even if some biases are unavoidable at a detailed quantitative level .",
    "in the last years , a wealth of studies have focused on the large scale structure and heterogeneities of networked structure of practical interest in social science , critical infrastructures and epidemiology  @xcite .",
    "the internet has been readily considered as a prototypical example of complex network by the scientific community and starting with the seminal paper by faloutsos , faloutsos and faloutsos  @xcite an impressive number of papers has dealt with the characterization of its large scale properties and hierarchies  @xcite .",
    "while the initial interest has been focused on the general principles leading to the basic organization features of complex networks , the research activity is now diving into system specific features that distinguish and highlight the various forces and/or engineering at work in each class of networks .",
    "this is a particular pressing need in the internet where even at the autonomous system ( as ) level the large scale self - organization principles are working along with economical and technical constraints , optimization principles and so on  @xcite .",
    "in addition actual internet maps are not free from errors and measurement biases . for this reason",
    ", recent works have been devoted to a better understanding of the possible sources of errors and biases presented by the experimental data  @xcite . since internet maps are typically based on a sampling of routes between sources and destinations ( obtained by tools such as ` traceroute ` ) , these studies have dealt with simplified models of ` traceroute`-like sampling , applied to graphs with various topological properties . they have shown that , except in some peculiar cases  @xcite , the sampling process allows to distinguish qualitatively between networks with strongly different properties ( homogeneous vs. heterogeneous ) , while a quantitative and detailed view of the network may suffer important biases .    here , we consider the use of the @xmath0-core decomposition as a probe for the structure of internet maps . the @xmath0-core decomposition has mostly been used in biologically related contexts , where it was applied to the analysis of protein interaction networks or in the prediction of protein functions @xcite .",
    "an interesting application in the area of networking has been provided by gkantsidis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and gaertler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0-core decomposition is used for filtering out peripheral autonomous systems ( ases ) in the case of internet maps .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition has also recently been used as a basis for the visualization of large networks , in particular for as maps  @xcite .",
    "finally , recent works using the @xmath0-core analysis have focused on the analysis of the internet maps obtained by the dimes project  @xcite . in ref.s",
    "@xcite , an approach based on the @xmath0-core decomposition has been used to provide a conceptual and structural model of the internet , the so - called medusa model for the internet . up to now",
    ", no study has however considered the @xmath0-core decomposition of the various commonly used models for complex networks , nor compared it to the one of real - world networks .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed to classify ases in five different levels or `` tiers '' , and given a method to extract this classification from the as directed graph .",
    "this method can however lead to some biases when the knowledge of the all peer - to - peer relationships is not complete .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition studied in this paper considers on the other hand undirected networks , and yields a finer hierarchy , not based on the commercial relations between vertices , and in which the number of levels is not fixed a priori but depends on the characteristics of the network .",
    "it is moreover not restricted to as maps but can be applied as well for example to internet router maps or more generally to any real or computer generated graph .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath1 of @xmath2 vertices and @xmath3 edges , the definition from  @xcite of @xmath0-cores is the following    * definition 1 * : a subgraph @xmath4 induced by the set @xmath5 is a _ @xmath0-core _ or a core of order @xmath0 if and only if the degree of every node @xmath6 induced in @xmath7 is greater or equal than @xmath0 ( in symbolic form , this reads @xmath8 ) , and @xmath7 is the maximum subgraph with this property .",
    "a @xmath0-core of @xmath9 can therefore be obtained by recursively removing all the vertices of degree less than @xmath0 , until all vertices in the remaining graph have degree at least @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth remarking that this process is not equivalent to prune vertices of a certain degree .",
    "indeed , a star - like subgraph formed by a vertex with a high degree that connects many vertices with degree one , and connected only with a single edge to the rest of the graph , is going to belong to the first shell no matter how high is the degree of the vertex .",
    "we will also use the following definitions    * definition 2 * : a vertex @xmath10 has _ shell index _ @xmath0 if it belongs to the @xmath0-core but not to @xmath11-core . *",
    "definition 3 * : a _ @xmath0-shell _ @xmath12",
    "is composed by all the vertices whose shell index is @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath0 such that @xmath12 is not empty is denoted @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath0-core is thus the union of all shells @xmath14 with @xmath15 . *",
    "definition 4 * : each connected set of vertices having the same shell index @xmath16 is a _ cluster _",
    "@xmath17 , where the corresponding set of edges are those connecting vertices of the cluster .",
    "each shell @xmath14 is thus composed by clusters @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of clusters in @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition therefore identifies progressively internal cores and decomposes the networks layer by layer , revealing the structure of the different @xmath0-shells from the outmost one to the most internal one , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ k - core1 ] .",
    "it is worth to note that the @xmath0-core decomposition can be easily implemented : the algorithm by batagelj and zversnik  @xcite presents a time complexity of order @xmath21 for a general graph .",
    "this makes the algorithm very efficient for sparse graphs , where @xmath22 is of order @xmath23 .",
    "a very interesting feature of the @xmath0-cores concerns their connectivity properties .",
    "it has been for example shown experimentally in  @xcite that the @xmath0-cores of the as map obtained by the dimes project  @xcite are @xmath0-connected , which means that @xmath0 disjoint paths are available between any two vertices belonging to the @xmath0-core .",
    "in fact , for any two vertices @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the network , with shell indices respectively @xmath26 and @xmath27 , there are ( with some exceptions for small values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) at least @xmath28 disjoint paths between @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "such property has important practical consequences since it implies larger and larger robustness and routing capacities for more and more central cores .",
    "the knowledge of such capacities identifies a very important hierarchy of ases that could be taken advantage of by newly created ases in order to choose to which other ases to establish connections .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ sec : appl ] .",
    "in this section , we inspect internet maps at the as level and compare their @xmath0-core structure with the insights obtained from models . in order to obtain internet connectivity information at the as level it is possible to inspect routing tables and paths stored in each router ( passive measurements ) or directly ask the network with a software probe ( active measurements ) . in the following we consider data from two recent large scale internet mapping projects using an active measurement approach .",
    "the skitter project at caida  @xcite has deployed several strategically placed probing monitors using a path probing software .",
    "all the data are then centrally collected and merged in order to obtain internet maps that maximizes the estimate of cross - connectivity .",
    "the second set we consider is provided by the distributed internet measurements and simulations ( dimes ) project  @xcite . at the time where the map was obtained , the project consisted of more than 5,000 measuring agents performing internet measurements such as ` traceroute ` and ` ping ` .",
    "table  [ table2 ] displays a summary of the basic properties of the considered internet maps .",
    "we have also investigated internet maps obtained from the oregon routeviews project @xcite ( not shown ) , with very similar results . in the following",
    "we show how the application of the @xmath0-core decomposition can shed light on important hierarchical properties of internet graphs , focusing on the as maps obtained by each project in 2005 .",
    "the first observation about the structure of the @xmath0-cores is that they remain connected .",
    "this is not a priori an obvious fact since one can easily imagine networks whose @xmath0-core decomposition yields several connected components corresponding , _",
    "e.g. _ to various communities . instead , each decomposition step is just _ peeling _",
    "the network leaving connected the inner part of the network , showing a high hierarchical structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the most connected part of the network is also the most central .",
    "figure  [ shell_as ] displays the size in terms of vertices of each @xmath0-shell as a function of its index . as for rsf or brite networks ( see section  [ sec : models ] ) , power - law like shapes are obtained .",
    "important fluctuations appear at large @xmath0 , which is not very surprising since such shells of large index are relatively small , except for the most central core which contains @xmath29 vertices at @xmath30 and @xmath31 vertices at @xmath32 for caida and dimes , respectively .",
    "such a structure has also been observed in the independent study of  @xcite .",
    ".main properties of the internet maps considered in the present study : number of vertices @xmath23 and of edges @xmath22 , average degree @xmath33 , maximum degree @xmath34 and maximum shell index @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while statistical signatures such as degree distribution , disassortative behavior and clustering spectrum are typically very stable over time , the @xmath0-core structure analysis reveals some finer variations .",
    "for example , the number of vertices and edges and the maximal shell index fluctuate in the caida maps .",
    "this can be tracked down to the fact that the number of sources used by caida changes ( 14 for the 2001/05 map , 21 for 2002/03 , 24 for 2003/05 and 2004/04 , and 22 for 2005/04 ) , and that the locations of some of these sources also change .",
    "interesting informations also arise from the study of the change in the composition of the various @xmath0-shells : we show as an example in fig .",
    "[ pchange ] the probability for a given as to change from a shell of index @xmath35 in a map obtained at a given time to a shell of index @xmath36 in the successive map .",
    "while most vertices do not change their shell index , as shown by the dark area around the diagonal , some suffer an important change of status , from a highly central shell to a peripherical one or vice - versa .",
    "this highlights the presence of strong structural fluctuations in the evolution of caida as maps .",
    "axis ) to the one of 2005/04 ( @xmath36 axis ) .",
    "the points in line @xmath37 correspond to ases that are present in 2004 but not in 2005 , and the column @xmath37 corresponds to the reverse situation .",
    "most nodes do not change shell index , as the dark area around the diagonal shows , but some important changes occur , with central nodes becoming peripherical , or vice - versa.,width=340 ]    . note how even nodes with large shell index disappear from one year to the next.,width=340 ]    a further fingerprint of such structural changes is provided by the analysis of the shell index of vertices that appear in or disappear from the maps between one snapshot and the other , as shown in fig.[p_out_in ] : vertices in all shells , even central ones , disappear from the caida maps even in the most recent maps , between 2004 and 2005 .",
    "the fluctuations observed in the shell index of ases may be related to three factors .",
    "a first one is the natural evolution of the internet structure .",
    "a second factor is the re - numbering of the ases for administrative reasons ( see http://www.iana.org ) .",
    "a third factor is the uncertainty and bias in the data collection . in this respect ,",
    "caida maps seem to exhibit a high level of instability , indicative of a mapping process less stable in time . in this context",
    ", the @xmath0-core analysis appears as an interesting tool to highlight the temporal changes of the internet structure as well as the measurement reliability in each particular experimental set - up , at an intermediate level between global quantities and local ones such as the degree .",
    "it will certainly be of interest in the future to study similar data for evolving dimes maps , which are obtained with a much larger set of sources .      in this paragraph",
    ", we perform a sensitivity analysis of the @xmath0-core decomposition with respect to potential sampling biases .",
    "in particular we want to assess the effect of incompleteness and sampling biases on the resulting structure of sampled graphs . for this reason we will produce incomplete synthetic sampling processes of network models and compare the @xmath0-core structure of the sampled graph with that of the original one .",
    "internet maps are currently obtained through sampling methods of the real internet , which are based on a merging of paths between sources and destinations , obtained either through border gateway protocol routing tables or through active ` traceroute ` measurements .",
    "such sampling processes present possible sources of errors and biases whose effect has been up to now studied essentially for the degree distributions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of idealized sampling processes on networks with various topologies has in particular revealed that the broadness of the degree distributions observed in internet maps is a genuine feature , although important biases can remain on the exact form of the distribution , due to an undersampling of vertices with small degree . moreover , although a path - based sampling process can produce a heterogeneous graph out of an homogeneous initial network ( such as an er graph ) , as rigorously shown in @xcite , this is restricted to the case of a single source probing .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that a single source ` traceroute`-like probing of any network yields essentially a tree , whose @xmath0-core decomposition is by definition trivial ( with @xmath38 ) .",
    "another obvious but important confirmation regards the largest shell index : by definition , a sampling can not discover paths or edges that do not exist , so that the maximal shell index of a network , @xmath39 , can not be increased by partial sampling ( nor can the maximal degree observed ) .",
    "in fact the actual @xmath39 is thus _ at least _ equal to the one found by a sampling of the true network .",
    "since more central cores are more connected , and more paths go through them , path - based sampling should intuitively discover and sample better more central cores , while the peripherical shells could suffer from stronger biases . in order to check such ideas",
    ", we perform a ` traceroute`-like probing of the various model networks considered in section [ sec : models ] , and compare their @xmath0-core decomposition before and after sampling .",
    "we use the same model for ` traceroute ` as in @xcite : a set of @xmath40 sources sends probes to @xmath41 destinations randomly placed on the network , and the shortest paths between the source - destination pairs are merged to compose the sampled network .",
    "we use @xmath42 sources , and various probing efforts measured by @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the size of the initial network ) , from a small value @xmath45 ( corresponding to a small density of targets @xmath46 ) to a much larger @xmath47 ( relatively large density of targets @xmath48 ) .",
    "-shells vs. @xmath0 for various models , before and after ` traceroute`-like sampling , with different probing efforts @xmath49 .",
    "the qualitative shapes are preserved by sampling.,width=343 ]    figure  [ biases_shell ] presents the curves of the @xmath0-shell size as a function of the index for various network models and various sampling efforts .",
    "for er networks , the populated shells change from being at index values only slightly under @xmath50 to much smaller values , with an almost uniform population of shells .",
    "the observed behavior is therefore completely different from the one observed in as maps . on the contrary ,",
    "the power - law shape obtained for rsf or brite networks , and comparable to the one of the as maps , is very robust , even if the slope is affected .",
    "indeed , shells of smaller indices are less well sampled .",
    "in particular , the size of the first shell is most strongly decreased by the sampling procedure ; in some cases in fact , the first shell is larger than the second in the original network , but becomes smaller in the sampled network .",
    "we note that in the available as maps , the first shell is indeed typically smaller than the second , and that the true as network thus very probably exhibits a much larger shell of index @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , one can expect that the exponent close to @xmath52 of the power - law behavior of the shell size vs. its index ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ shell_as ] ) is a lower bound and that such value might be reconsidered in the future thanks to more and more extensive sampling efforts . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the shell of largest index is substantially larger than the ones with immediately lower indices is well preserved , even if its index is substantially decreased by the fact that many edges are ignored during the sampling process .",
    "-cores , rescaled by the corresponding average values , for some network models after sampling through a ` traceroute`-like process with @xmath42 sources and target density @xmath53 .",
    "the data collapse shows that the self - similarity is preserved by sampling.,width=340 ]    -cores , rescaled by the corresponding average values , for some network models after sampling through a ` traceroute`-like process with @xmath42 sources and target density @xmath53.,width=340 ]    figures [ knn_tr ] and [ cnn_tr ] moreover show that the self - similar properties of the @xmath0-core decomposition are preserved by the sampling process .",
    "although the precise form of the degree distribution of the whole network is slightly altered , the basic correlation properties are conserved by the sampling . moreover ,",
    "the self - similar structure of the @xmath0-core decomposition is also preserved , as a comparison of fig.s  [ knn_tr ] and [ cnn_tr ] with fig.s  [ knn_models ] and [ cnn_models ] clearly shows .",

    "the line at @xmath54 represents the probability of vertices of shell index @xmath35 to be absent from the sampled graph .",
    "the initial network is obtained by the brite generator . here",
    "@xmath42 sources and a fraction @xmath46 of targets are used .",
    "the low sampling effort implies that many nodes are not discovered , and that the measured shell index can differ strongly from the original one . ]",

    "the measured and the original shell index become more correlated.,title=\"fig : \" ] -.2 in   for @xmath42 sources and @xmath55 ( top ) and @xmath48 ( bottom ) .",
    "as the sampling effort is increased , the measured and the original shell index become more correlated.,title=\"fig : \" ]    while the main statistical properties of the @xmath0-core decomposition are therefore largely conserved by the sampling process , allowing to distinguish between networks with different topological structures , important quantitative biases can appear and compromise the accuracy of the measurements , as we now investigate . in order to understand such effects in more details ,",
    "we indeed show in fig.s  [ diff.1 ] and [ diff1 ] the probability for a vertex of given shell index in the original network to have another shell index in the sampled network , in the case of an original network obtained by the brite generator . at low sampling effort ,",
    "many vertices are simply left undiscovered , and the shell index properties can be strongly affected in a seemingly erratic way , as shown by the important scattering of data in fig .",
    "[ diff.1 ] .",
    "as soon however as the sampling effort is increased to a more reasonable level , a strong correlation appears between the true shell index and its value in the sampled graph , even if a systematic downwards trend is observed ( fig .",
    "[ diff1 ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "our results indicate that the sampling biases do in fact affect only slightly the measure of the statistical properties of heterogeneous graphs and of their @xmath0-core decomposition , even at relatively low level of sampling .",
    "in fact , the routing properties as `` measured '' by the shell indices will be in fact rather underevaluated due to the incomplete sampling of edges , which can be taken as a rather good news showing that the as network probably offers better performance ( qos , robustness ) than what can be measured by the present maps .",
    "we have presented the application of the @xmath0-core decomposition to the analysis of large scale networks models and of large scale internet maps .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition allows the progressive pruning of the networks and the identification of subgraphs of increasing centrality .",
    "these subgraphs have the property of being more and more densely connected , and therefore of presenting more and more robust routing capabilities .",
    "the study of the obtained subgraphs uncovers the main hierarchical layers of the network and allows for their statistical characterization .",
    "strikingly , we observe for the internet at the autonomous system a statistical self - similarity of the topological properties for cores of increasing centrality .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition proves useful to uncover not only the hierarchical decomposition of real maps , but also for model validations .",
    "for example , many models , although having , _ e.g. _ degree distribution and clustering properties similar to those of real maps , do not present shell index values as large as the real data , nor a similar structure in which each @xmath0-core is composed by a constant fraction of the @xmath56-core .",
    "the @xmath0-core decomposition should therefore be considered as a _ supplementary _ valuable tool for network characterization and model validation .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the router level @xmath0-core structure of the internet appears to have different properties than those appearing at the as level  @xcite .",
    "this calls for repeating the present analysis for different router level maps available at the moment in order to better emphasize the structural difference exhibited by the two different mapping granularities .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-core analysis allows to compare maps obtained by different mapping processes , follow their temporal evolution and assess the stability of these maps .",
    "it also appears as an interesting way of discriminating between various topologies , even after sampling biases have been introduced : for example , a sampled er network may display a power - law like degree distribution in case of a very limited sampling effort , but its @xmath0-core decomposition will in any case remain very different from the one of sampled heterogeneous networks .    finally , the @xmath0-core decomposition may be used also to define a computational feasible centrality measure and a hierarchy between the nodes of a network .",
    "it combines the degree ranking with more global structural properties , connectedness and routing capabilities , providing a centrality measure that is highly correlated with the various standard definitions such as degree and betweenness centrality .    in conclusion",
    ", the @xmath0-core decomposition appears at a general level as a very interesting and useful additional tool for analysis of complex networks , with particular relevance in the context of technological and communication networks .",
