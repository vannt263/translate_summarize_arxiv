    "in these thirty years , it seems that phase field equations describe the novel approach to the stefan problems . for example",
    ", it has been proved that the phase field equations converge to the equations of the stefan problem as a singular limit .",
    "caginalp and a co - researcher [ 1 - 4 ] have studied the reduction of these equations in the singular limit of stefan problems and hele - shaw problem .",
    "the solution of the stefan problem is obtained from the phase - field equations which consist the heat equation and the ginzburg - landau equation by soner [ 10 ] .",
    "hence , by the phase - field equations , we determine the sharp profile of the phase , the temperature distribution and the velocity of the moving interface between a solid and a liquid .",
    "+ in this paper , using the landau - ginzburg theory of phase transition , physical properties show the phase field equations we consider , which is reduced to by the free energy @xmath1.\\ ] ] first we use the phase field equations of `` caginalp type '' due to [ 2 ] , @xmath2 directly and numerically . here",
    "@xmath3 is a derivative of a symmetric double - well potential with minima at @xmath4 , @xmath5 a latent heat and @xmath0 @xmath6 liquid ( e.g. water ) , @xmath7 solid ( e.g. ice ) .",
    "+ second we investigate the following equations @xmath8\\ ] ] in two space dimensions , where @xmath9 is a mobility of @xmath0 and these equations are called the modified allen - cahn equations .",
    "+ third we consider the following equations due to [ 6 ] , @xmath10\\left[1-\\varphi^2\\right],\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=d\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t } \\end{array}\\ ] ] then applying the moving frame to these equations yields @xmath11\\left[1-\\varphi^2\\right]=0\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+d\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}-\\frac{v}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial x}=0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] finally , we also use the following relations due to [ 8 ] , @xmath12\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}=\\nabla^2 c+\\alpha\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t}+\\left(\\nabla^2\\varphi-\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t}\\right)\\frac{\\alpha\\cdot\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t}}{da|\\nabla\\varphi| } \\end{array}\\ ] ] to simulate the symmetric circular domain of solid . here",

    "+ the so - called one phase stefan problem has no discontinuous - gradient model for the temperature distribution .",
    "however , in the two phase stefan problem , this phenomena occurs .",
    "thus one can obtain the sharp - interface numerically by investigating what control it .",
    "+ our first purpose of this paper is to find out what determine the sharpness of the interface between two different phases ( e.g. ice and water ) .",
    "the second is to investigate asymptotic behavior of the volume of the solidification and dissolution and/or precipitation . + we calculate these equations numerically performed in two - dimensions .",
    "we take full advantage of the phase field parameter @xmath0 to track the interface on which complicated movements or changes are needed .",
    "more precisely , we analyze the dissolution and/or precipitation without the unknown velocity functions like the navier - stokes equations numerically .",
    "in our survey , we use the finite differential method for the time evolution equations numerically . + for eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , we use the 5-point finite difference stencil @xmath18 and we use the forward scheme in time @xmath19 for eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we use the forward scheme in time @xmath19 on the other hand , the second order center - ward scheme in space @xmath20 for eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , the gradient of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , we use the central difference approximation @xmath23 respectively , and @xmath24 if we do not have any confusion , we abbreviate the `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "this result is well - known",
    ". however we consider it to show an asymptotic behavior of the solutions for the stefan problems . + in general",
    ", the parabolic partial differential equations often have initial - boundary value problems in a certain sense and the exact solutions are difficult to obtain by the direct calculations .",
    "therefore the fact that we investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions of general case plays an important rle in this sense .",
    "thus we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 corresponds to the integral formula `` gaussian distribution '' ( see friedman , 1964 , 2008 ) .",

    "volume 2 .        + we obtain the fact that the interface between two regions in the solidification and dissolution and/or precipitation are determined by the `` coupling parameters '' and coefficients , and sharp in our numerical simulation .",
    "+ the volume controlled by the solidification and dissolution and/or precipitation is the dimensionless versions .",
    "we report that the volume of them is proportional to the time step ( nstep in table i ) ."
