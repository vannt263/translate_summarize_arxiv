    "the properties of the galaxies change as a function of environment .",
    "galaxies in low - density regions tend to be blue , star - forming objects with disk morphology , whereas those living in denser regions tend to be red , passive objects with more spheroidal morphologies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the environment also seems to affect the probability of a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , at least in the high - luminosity end ( @xcite ) . by looking at a multi - cluster system at z  @xmath0  0.165 , our main goal is to understand better the role played by the environment in the transformation of galaxies from actively star - forming to passive , with the subsequent morphological change , and the relation between agn activity and environment .",
    "the osiris mapping of emission - line galaxies in a901/2 ( omega ) survey has been designed to study agn and star formation activity as a function of environment in the a901/2 multi - cluster system at z@xmath00.165 .",
    "this system , which spans@xmath00.5 @xmath1 0.5 deg@xmath2 ( @xmath05x5  mpc@xmath2 ) contains a wide variety of environments and has been extensively studied by the stages collaboration ( @xcite ) . besides that , there is already data from this system in different wavelengths , including _ xmm - newton _ , _ galex _ , _ spitzer _ , 2df , gmrt , magellan , and the 17-band combo-17 photometric redshift survey .    despite the wealth of data aleready available , it is crucial to have optical diagnostics such as emission line spectra to really understand the roles of obscured and unobscured star formation , and the fraction of low - luminosity agn with no x - ray emission . to obtain these missing optical diagnostics",
    "we have used the osiris instrument in narrow - band tunable filter mode at the gtc to map the h@xmath3 and [ n ii ] emission lines in the a901/2 multi - cluster system .",
    "these two lines contain a lot of information , since the h@xmath3 line is a very good star formation indicator ( @xcite ) , and in combination with the [ n ii ] line can provide diagnostics about the agn activity in the galaxies , using the whan diagram introduced by @xcite",
    ".    to map these two emission lines in the whole system , we divided the @xmath00.5 @xmath1 0.5 deg@xmath2 field into 20 circular fields of 8 arcmin diameter each ( osiris field of view ) .",
    "for each field a series of ` monochromatic ' images was taken with a fixed wavelength step between them . for an optimal deblending of the two lines",
    "this step was set to 7 .",
    "the wavelength across the field of view also changes as a function of distance to the optical center , following expression ( 29 ) in @xcite . in this way ,",
    "h@xmath3 and [ n ii ] are mapped by taking sufficient steps in wavelength based on the mean redshift of each field . in this work we present the results from the analysis of the two densest fields .",
    "to build up the low - resolution spectra out of these images we performed aperture photometry using two different apertures : one matching the seeing of the images and another one encompassing the full extent of the galaxies .",
    "an example of one of these spectra is shown in figure [ mcmc ] . as our main goal is to measure the fluxes in the two lines we need to model our data .",
    "our model is a composite of three gaussians ( because there is another weaker [ n ii ] line at @xmath4 ) and the continuum .    to exploit all the information contained in our data we use an algorigthm based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques , which not only provides the maximum likelihood of the model parameters but also generates their full probability densitiy distributions . in our case",
    "we employ the software emcee ( @xcite ) .",
    "an example of the performance of the algorithm is shown in figure [ mcmc ] . from the output of the mcmc",
    "runs we selected a sample based on the probability of a detection in h@xmath3 , and a redshift consistent with one or the two lines being within the wavelength range .    from the analysis of the two densest fields we use the whan diagnostic diagram ( @xcite ) in figure [ whan ] to evaluate the probability of the galaxies hosting an agn , star formation or both . by looking at the spatial distribution of these sources",
    "we find that both agn and star - forming galaxies tend to avoid the densest regions .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosity function , shown in figure [ half ] , when compared with other studies , shows fewer high star - forming objects than the field , but more than in dense clusters . using the sfr vs stellar mass relation ,",
    "there is also evidence of a widespread suppression of the star formation in the cluster galaxies compared with the field ones . besides that",
    ", our sfr estimates based on the h@xmath3 flux agree well with other sfr indicators .",
    "the analysis of only one tenth ( 2 fields out of 20 ) of the data of the omega survey has shown that tunable filter observations are a very powerful tool to obtain emission line fluxes in a large number of galaxies in single redshift windows .",
    "the results found in this work make the analysis of the whole data set very promising as we will be able to show the environmental effects on agn and star formation activity in @xmath0 1000 objects in the multi - cluster system at z=0.165 ."
