    "the lie groups @xmath21 and @xmath22 each contain a hierarchy of integrable bi - hamiltonian curve flows described by a chiral schrdinger map equation for the @xmath222 flow , a chiral mkdv map equation for the @xmath227 flow , and a chiral wave map equation for the @xmath248 flow coming from the kernel of the recursion operator of each hierarchy .",
    "the principal normal components in a parallel frame along these flows in each lie group satisfy @xmath4-invariant soliton equations respectively given by a vector nls equation , a complex vector mkdv equation , and a hyperbolic vector equation related to a complex vector sg equation .",
    "these two lie groups are singled out as exhausting the isometry groups @xmath3 that arise for compact riemannian symmetric spaces of the type @xmath2 as known from cartan s classification @xcite . moreover , since @xmath0 is locally isomorphic to @xmath75 when ( and only when ) @xmath11 , the integrable hierarchies of curve flows in the spaces @xmath317 therefore coincide precisely in the scalar case , with the @xmath270 flows reducing to @xmath318-invariant scalar soliton equations consisting of the nls equation @xmath319 and complex versions of mkdv and sg equations @xmath320 and @xmath321 ( up to rescalings of @xmath322 and @xmath261 )",
    ".    the present results thus account for the existence of the two unitarily - invariant vector generalizations of the nls equation and the complex mkdv and sg equations that are known from symmetry - integrability classifications @xcite .",
    "moreover , their bi - hamiltonian integrability structure as summarized by the operators @xmath323 is shown to be geometrically encoded in the frame structure equations for the corresponding curve flows in the two lie groups @xmath18 .",

    "indeed , the bi - hamiltonian operator structure derived in @xcite for curve flows in @xmath2 can be recovered from @xmath324 and @xmath249 if the connection variables @xmath176 and @xmath178 are restricted to be real while the flow - direction variable @xmath302 is restricted to be imaginary , in which case the @xmath248 flow and all even - flows reduce to the hierarchy of flows in @xmath2 . more particularly , the operator @xmath325 acts as a vector nls / mkdv recursion operator which is ( up to a sign ) a complex version of the vector mkdv recursion operator coming from @xmath2 .    finally , there is a broad generalization @xcite of these results yielding hierarchies of group - invariant soliton equations associated to integrable curve flows described by geometric map equations in all semisimple lie groups and riemannian symmetric spaces .",
