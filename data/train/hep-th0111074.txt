    "the question of interpretation of quantum gravity calculations is one of the most difficult in quantum field theory . apart from difficulties caused by the formal inapplicability of basic notions of the flat space theory , such as the asymptotic states in the standard s - matrix approach , the very notion of classical limit in the quantum theory of gravitation , underlying the issue of interpretation , is essentially different from that in other theories of fundamental interactions . it can not be formulated neither as the large mass limit of interacting particles , since the gravitational radiative corrections do not disappear in this limit @xcite , nor even as the formal limit @xmath1 as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the first post - newtonian correction to the gravitational potential , given by the quantum theory , is twice as large as that given by the schwarzschild solution of the classical theory .",
    "it was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that the correct correspondence between classical and quantum theories is to be established not for fundamental particles described by field operators entering the action functional , but rather for _ macroscopic _ bodies consisting of a large number of such particles .",
    "this interpretation of the correspondence principle is underlined by an observation that the @xmath2-loop radiative contribution to the @xmath2th post - newtonian correction to the gravitational field of a body with mass @xmath3 consisting of @xmath4 elementary particles with mass @xmath5 contains an extra factor of @xmath6 in comparison with the corresponding tree contribution .",
    "thus , the effective gravitational field produced by the body turns into the classical solution of the einstein equations in the limit @xmath7 ( and therefore , @xmath8 ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of this interpretation is that in the case of _ finite _ @xmath9 the loop corrections of the order @xmath0 describe deviations of the spacetime metric from classical solutions of the einstein equations .    to justify this interpretation completely",
    ", one has to prove its gauge - independence , i.e. , that arbitrariness in the choice of gauge conditions fixing the general covariance does not make values of measurable quantities , built from the effective metric , ambiguous . in ref .",
    "@xcite , independence of the gauge parameter , weighting the dewitt gauge conditions in the action , was proved by direct calculation at the one - loop order .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that this result is not accidental , and to prove it in a much more simple and general way for arbitrary gauge conditions .",
    "after that , application to the black holes will be discussed .",
    "let us consider a body with mass @xmath10 consisting of an arbitrary number @xmath11 of particles . for simplicity the latter will be assumed identical scalars with mass @xmath5 denoted by @xmath12 dynamics of the field @xmath13 is described by the action @xmath14 while the action for the gravitational field dynamical variables of the gravitational field @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 being the newton gravitational constant .",
    "the action @xmath19 is invariant under the following gauge transformations are raised and lowered , if convenient , with the help of minkowski metric @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 are the ( infinitesimal ) gauge functions .",
    "let this invariance be fixed by the following conditions @xmath23 for the beginning , @xmath24 will be assumed linear , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are some differential operators ( lorentz covariant or not ) independent of the fields @xmath27 the most general case will be considered later . weighted in the usual way",
    ", gauge conditions enter the faddeev - popov action @xmath28 in the form of the gauge fixing term @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the feynman gauge parameter , and @xmath31 are the faddeev - popov ghosts .",
    "let us now turn to examination of the radiative corrections . since we are interested in the quantum contribution to the first post - newtonian correction , the only diagram we need to consider is the one - loop diagram pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as a simple dimensional analysis shows",
    ", other one - loop diagrams do not contain root singularities @xmath32 corresponding to the @xmath0-contribution , while the higher - loop diagrams are of higher orders in the newton constant .",
    "note that it is the propagation of virtual scalar particle near its mass shell which is responsible for the occurrence of the @xmath0-contribution .",
    "although direct calculation of this diagram is cumbersome , the question of the @xmath30-dependence of its @xmath0 contribution can be easily analyzed as follows .    in the linear gauge",
    "( [ gaugefixlin ] ) , gauge dependence of this diagram is determined by that of the graviton propagators .",
    "if the graviton propagator is defined by @xmath33 then its @xmath30-derivative @xmath34 on the other hand , multiplying definition ( [ hpr ] ) by the generator @xmath35 one has @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ghost propagator satisfying @xmath38 let us first consider the inner propagators in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in view of eqs .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) , ( [ slav ] ) , @xmath30-dependent terms in these propagators are attached to the scalar line through the generator @xmath39 on the other hand , the action @xmath40 is invariant with respect to the gauge transformations ( [ gaugesym ] ) , @xmath41 differentiating this identity with respect to @xmath42 setting @xmath43 and taking into account that the external scalar lines are on the mass shell @xmath44 each of the two @xmath45 vertices can be written as @xmath46 thus , under contraction with the vertex factor , the scalar particle propagator , @xmath47 satisfying @xmath48 cancels out @xmath49 we conclude that the @xmath0 contribution to the one - particle - irreducible part of fig .  [ fig1 ] is @xmath30-independent .",
    "now , using eqs .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) and ( [ slav ] ) in the external propagator , we see that the @xmath30-derivative of the corresponding contribution to the whole diagram is proportional to the generator @xmath39 in other words , variations of the feynman parameter induce spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "this important result allows us to interpret the @xmath0-part of the radiative corrections in a purely classical manner .",
    "it was mentioned above that the loop corrections to the spacetime metric can be endowed with physical meaning only if their gauge dependence does not introduce an ambiguity into the values of measurable quantities .",
    "the latter are generally defined as functionals of the field variables , invariant with respect to the spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "since we presently deal with the first post - newtonian correction , this criterion can be written @xmath50 where @xmath51 is any observable , and @xmath52 the effective metric field .",
    "we thus see that variations of the feynman parameter do not affect values of the observables .",
    "this is as it should be , since , unlike other gauge parameters entering the gauge conditions @xmath24 and determining structure of a given coordinate system , the weighting parameter @xmath30 does not have any geometrical meaning . furthermore , using the @xmath30-independence of observables , one can put @xmath53 then eq .",
    "( [ slav ] ) shows that the effective metric can always be chosen to satisfy the gauge conditions exactly , @xmath54    finally , let us consider the most general case of nonlinear gauge conditions .",
    "the gauge fixing term has the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the linear part of @xmath57 having the form ( [ gaugefixlin ] ) , and @xmath58 is of higher orders in the fields @xmath59 responsible for the appearance of new , `` fictitious '' interactions of gravitons . at the one - loop order ,",
    "there is only one new diagram , of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which the triple graviton vertex is generated by the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ nonlin ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the effect of addition of this diagram is again a spacetime diffeomorphism .",
    "indeed , if the factor @xmath56 acts on one of the internal graviton lines , using eq .",
    "( [ slav ] ) and repeating literally the reasoning which led to eq .",
    "( [ cancel ] ) , we see that the @xmath0-terms fall out of the diagram . if the factor @xmath56 acts on the external graviton line , the use of eq .",
    "( [ slav ] ) shows that the corresponding contribution is proportional to @xmath39    thus , variations of the feynman parameter are proved to be equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms for the most general gauge conditions .",
    "it was mentioned in the introduction that in comparison with the classical general relativity , the one - loop contribution to the first post - newtonian correction to the gravitational field of a macroscopic body consisting of @xmath11 particles is suppressed by the factor @xmath60 for instance , if the gauge condition is that of dewitt @xmath61 the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric body with mass @xmath10 is @xcite @xmath62 this suppression of the quantum contribution guaranties that the classical predictions of general relativity are in agreement with observations of motion of macroscopic bodies ( for the solar gravitational field , for instance , @xmath63 ) .    as was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , gravitational interaction of the constituent particles is taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ exampl ] ) , up to terms of higher order in @xmath64 by identifying @xmath10 as the gravitational mass of the body .",
    "this is legitimate only if the interaction is not too strong , namely , if its expansion in powers of @xmath18 is justified .",
    "let us now consider a situation when evolution of the system of particles ends up with formation of the horizon .",
    "then the above condition on the strength of particle interaction inevitably breaks down at some stage . in the absence of self - consistent quantum theory of gravitation",
    ", nothing can be said about the ultimate fate of the collapsing matter .",
    "what can be said , however , is that from the point of view of external observer , the number @xmath11 is now irrelevant to the gravitational field of the collapsar ( this is a consequence of the `` no hair '' theorem ) .",
    "made by the infinite gravitational force indivisible , this object can be considered as a `` particle '' .",
    "i will assume that it can be described by a scalar field with mass @xmath10 equal to the gravitational mass of the black hole .",
    "then the one - loop contribution of the order @xmath0 to the gravitational field of the black hole , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is @xcite @xmath65 written down in the coordinate space with the help of the formulae @xmath66 equation ( [ correctionp ] ) gives , in the static case , @xmath67 in order to find complete expression for the metric in the first post - newtonian approximation , one has to add the tree contribution , given by the schwarzschild solution transformed to the dewitt gauge condition ( [ dewitt ] ) under which eqs .",
    "( [ correctionr ] ) were derived .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .  @xcite , we thus obtain the following expression for the interval @xmath68where @xmath69 are the standard spherical angles , and @xmath70    as an application of the obtained result , let us consider one of the classic effects of general relativity , the orbit precession in the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric body . let a test particle with mass @xmath71 move in the equatorial plane ( @xmath72 ) around black hole . denoting @xmath73 the action of the body",

    "the first two terms in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ actest ] ) coincide with the corresponding terms of classical theory , while the third does not , leading to the angular shift of the perihelion @xmath80 per period ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the major semiaxis and the eccentricity of the orbit , respectively ) , which is to be compared with the classic result @xmath83",
    "interpretation of the correspondence principle , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , endows the @xmath0 loop contributions with direct physical meaning as describing deviations of the spacetime metric from classical solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "this purely classical treatment of the @xmath0 loop contributions is supported by the main result of the present work : variations of the weighting parameter are equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "thus , observables built from the effective metric are independent of the unphysical feynman parameter . as to other gauge parameters entering the gauge conditions @xmath24 and determining geometry of a given coordinate system ,",
    "the corresponding analysis is much more complicated and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it should be clear from the considerations of sec .",
