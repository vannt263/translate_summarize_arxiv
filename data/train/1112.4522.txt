    "there is a very common fallacy , here called the _ separation fallacy _ , that is involved in the interpretation of quantum experiments involving a certain type of separation such as the :    * double - slit experiments , * which - way interferometer experiments , * polarization analyzer experiments , * stern - gerlach experiments , and * quantum eraser experiments .    in each case , given an incoming quantum particle , the apparatus creates a certain labelled or tagged ( i.e. , entangled ) superposition of certain eigenstates ( the `` separation '' ) .",
    "detectors can be placed in certain positions ( determined by the tags ) so that when the evolving superposition state is finally projected or collapsed by the detectors , then only one of the eigenstates can register at each detector .",
    "the _ separation fallacy _ mistakes the creation of a tagged or entangled superposition for a measurement .",
    "thus it treats the particle as if it had already been projected or collapsed to an eigenstate at the separation apparatus rather than at the later detectors .",
    "but if the detectors were suddenly removed while the particle was in the apparatus , then the superposition would continue to evolve and have distinctive effects ( e.g. , interference patterns in the two - slit experiment ) .",
    "hence the separation fallacy makes it _ seem _ that by the delayed choice to insert or remove the appropriately positioned detectors , one can _ retro - cause _ either a collapse to an eigenstate or not at the particle s entrance into the separation apparatus .",
    "the separation fallacy is remedied by :    * taking superposition seriously , i.e. , by seeing that the separation apparatus created an entangled _ superposition _ state of the alternatives ( regardless of what happens later ) which evolves until a measurement is taken , and * taking into account the role of detector placement ( `` contextuality '' ) , i.e. , by seeing that if a suitably positioned detector , as determined by the positional labels or tags , can only detect one collapsed eigenstate , then it does not mean that the particle was _ already _ in that eigenstate prior to the measurement ( e.g. , it does not mean that the particle `` went through one slit , '' `` took one arm , '' or was already in a polarization or spin eigenstate ) .",
    "the separation fallacy will be first illustrated in a non - technical manner for the first four experiments .",
    "then the lessons will be applied in a slightly more technical discussion of quantum eraser experiments  where , due to the separation fallacy , incorrect inferences about retrocausality have been rampant .",
    "in the well - known setup for the double - slit experiment , if a detector @xmath0 is placed a small finite distance after slit 1 so a particle `` going through the other slit '' can not reach the detector , then a hit at the detector is usually interpreted as `` the particle went through slit 1 . ''    fig1a-two-slit.png + figure 1a    but this is incorrect .",
    "the particle is in a superposition state , which we might represent schematically as @xmath1 , that evolves until it hits the detector which projects ( or collapses ) the superposition to one of ( the evolved versions of ) the slit - eigenstates .",
    "the particle s state was not collapsed earlier so it was not previously in the @xmath2 eigenstate , i.e. , it did not `` go through slit 1 . ''",
    "thus what is called `` detecting which slit the particle went through '' is a misinterpretation .",
    "it is only placing a detector in such a position so that when the superposition projects to an eigenstate , only one of the eigenstates can register in that detector .",
    "it is about _ detector placement _ ; it is not about which - slit .",
    "by erroneously talking about the detector `` showing the particle went through slit 1 , '' we imply a type of retro - causality .",
    "if the detector is suddenly removed after the particle has passed the slits , then the superposition state continues to evolve and shows interference on the far wall ( not shown)in which case people say `` the particle went through both slits . ''",
    "thus the `` bad talk '' makes it seem that by removing or inserting the detector after the particle is beyond the slits , one can retro - cause the particle to go through both slits or one slit only .",
    "this sudden removal or insertion of detectors that can only detect one of the slit - eigenstates is a version of wheeler s delayed choice thought - experiment @xcite .",
    "fig1b-wheeler-delayed-twoslit.png + figure 1b .",
    "wheeler s delayed choice 2 slit experiment    in wheeler s version of the experiment , there are two detectors which are positioned behind the removable screen so they can only detect one of the projected ( evolved ) slit eigenstates when the screen is removed .",
    "the choice to remove the screen or not is delayed until after a photon has traversed the two slits .",

    "such descriptions using the separation fallacy are unfortunately common and have generated a spate of speculations about retrocausality .",
    "consider a mach - zehnder - style interferometer with only one beam - splitter ( e.g. , half - silvered mirror ) at the photon source which creates the photon superposition : @xmath3 ( which stand for `` transmit '' to the upper arm or `` reflect '' into the lower arm at the first beam - splitter ) .",
    "fig2-interferometer1bs.png + figure 2 : one beam - splitter    when detector @xmath0 registers a hit , it is said that `` the photon was reflected and thus took the lower arm '' of the interferometer and similarly for @xmath4 and passing through into the upper arm .",
    "this is the interferometer analogue of putting two up - close detectors after the two slits in the two - slit experiment .    and",
    "this standard description is incorrect for the same reasons .",
    "the photon stays in the superposition state until the detectors force a projection to one of the ( evolved ) eigenstates .",
    "if the projection is to the evolved @xmath5 eigenstate then only @xmath0 will get a hit , and similarly for @xmath4 and the evolved version of @xmath6 .",
    "the point is that the placement of the detectors ( like in the double - slit experiment ) only captures one or the other of the projected eigenstates .",
    "now insert a second beam - splitter as in the following diagram .",
    "fig3-interferometer2bs.png + figure 3 : two beam - splitters    it is said that the second beam - splitter `` erases '' the `` which - way information '' so that a hit at either detector could have come from either arm , and thus an interference pattern emerges .    but this is also incorrect . the superposition state @xmath7 ( which contains no which - way information ) is further transformed at the second beam - splitter to the superposition @xmath8 that can be regrouped according to what can register at each detector :    @xmath9 _ { d_{1}}+\\left [   \\left\\vert t1,t2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\vert r1,r2\\right\\rangle \\right ]   _ { d_{2}}$ ] .",
    "the so - called `` which - way information '' was not there to be `` erased '' since the particle did not take one way or the other in the first place .",
    "the second beam - splitter only allows the superposition state @xmath10   _ { d_{1}}$]to be registered at @xmath0 or the superposition state @xmath11   _ { d_{2}}$ ] to be registered at @xmath4 . by using a phase shifter @xmath12 ,",
    "an interference pattern can be recorded at each detector since each one is now detecting a superposition that will involve interference .    by inserting or removing the second beam - splitter after the particle has traversed the first beam - splitter ( as in @xcite ) , the separation fallacy makes it seem that we can retro - cause the particle to go through both arms or only one arm .    the point is not the second beam - splitter but the detectors being able to register the collapse to either eigenstate and thus the interference between them . instead of inserting the second beam - splitter , we could rig up more mirrors , a lens , and a single detector so that when the single detector causes the collapse , then it is will register either arm - eigenstate .",
    "fig4-interferometerlense.png + figure 4 : detector placed to register all hits    this might also be ( mis)interpreted as `` erasing '' the `` which - way information '' but in fact the photon did not go through just one arm so there was no such information to be erased .",
    "the point is the positioning of the detector so that it detects the evolved superposition @xmath13 that will show interference .",
    "any setup that would allow a detector to register both collapsed eigenstates ( and thus to register the interference effects of the evolving superposition ) would _ ipso facto _ be a setup that could be ( mis)interpreted as `` erasing '' the `` which - way information . '' that is why the separation fallacy is so persistent in the interpretation of which - way interferometer and other quantum separation experiments .",
    "another common textbook example of the separation fallacy is the treatment of polarization analyzers such as calcite crystals that are said to create two orthogonally polarized beams in the upper and lower channels , say @xmath14 and @xmath15 from an arbitrary incident beam .",
    "fig5-vh-analyzer.png + figure 5 : @xmath16-analyzer    the output from the analyzer @xmath17 is routinely described as a `` vertically polarized '' beam and `` horizontally polarized '' beam as if the analyzer was itself a measurement that collapsed or projected the incident beam to either of those polarization eigenstates .",
    "this _ seems _ to follow because if one positions a detector in the upper beam then only vertically polarized photons are observed and similarly for the lower beam and horizontally polarized photons .",
    "a blocking mask in one of the beams has the same effect as a detector to project the photons to eigenstates . if a blocking mask in inserted in the lower beam , then only vertically polarized photons will be found in the upper beam , and vice - versa .    but here again , the story is about detector ( or blocking mask ) placement ( `` placement '' is more precise than `` contextuality '' ) ; it is not about the analyzer supposedly projecting a photon into one or the other of the eigenstates .",
    "the analyzer puts the incident photons into a superposition state , an entangled superposition state that associates polarization and the spatial channel . if a detector is placed in , say , the upper channel , then _ that _ is the measurement that collapses the evolved superposition state .",
    "if the collapse is to the vertical polarization eigenstate then it will register only in the upper detector and similarly for a collapse to the horizontal polarization eigenstate for any detector placed in the lower channel .",
    "thus it is misleadingly said that the upper beam was already vertically polarized and the lower beam was already horizontally polarized as if the analyzer had already done the projection to one of the eigenstates .",
    "if the analyzer had in fact induced a collapse to the eigenstates , then any prior polarization of the incident beam would be lost .",
    "hence assume that the incident beam was prepared in a specific polarization of , say , @xmath18 half - way between the states of vertical and horizontal polarization .",
    "then follow the @xmath16-analyzer @xmath17 with its inverse @xmath19 to form an analyzer loop @xcite .",
    "fig6-vh-analyzer-loop.png + figure 6 : @xmath16-analyzer loop    the characteristic feature of an analyzer loop is that it outputs the same polarization , in this case @xmath20 , as the incident beam .",
    "this would be impossible if the @xmath17 analyzer had in fact rendered all the photons into a vertical or horizontal eigenstate thereby destroying the information about the polarization of the incident beam .",
    "but since no collapsing measurement was in fact made in @xmath17 or its inverse , the original beam can be the output of an analyzer loop .",
    "very few textbooks realize there is even a problem with presenting a polarization analyzer such as a calcite crystal as creating two beams with orthogonal eigenstate polarizations  rather than creating a tagged superposition state so that appropriately positioned detectors can detect only one eigenstate when the detectors cause the projections to eigenstates .",
    "one ( partial ) exception is dicke and wittke s text @xcite . at first they present polarization analyzers as if they measured polarization and thus `` destroyed completely any information that we had about the polarization '' @xcite of the incident beam .",
    "but then they note a problem :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` the equipment [ polarization analyzers ] has been described in terms of devices which measure the polarization of a photon . strictly speaking ,",
