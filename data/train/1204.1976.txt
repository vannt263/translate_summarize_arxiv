    "the advent of large radial velocity surveys and the @xmath9 mission  @xcite have revealed planets with masses several times that of earth in orbits that may permit the existence of liquid surface water  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most favorable objects for follow - up studies in the next decade are planets in the habitable zone ( hz ) around low - mass stars , dwarfs of spectral type m0v and later ( also referred to as m - dwarfs or dm stars ) .",
    "these planets have received considerable theoretical attention , and a consensus is emerging that neither synchronous rotation nor close proximity to the host star rules out the possibility of biological development on these worlds  @xcite .",
    "the heating and chemistry of an earth - like atmosphere depends strongly on the characteristics of the host star , both spectrally and temporally .",
    "the photospheric ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum of m - stars is very small relative to solar - type stars due to their lower effective temperature .",
    "bright chromospheric and transition region emission lines dominate the uv spectrum of m - dwarfs , containing a much larger fraction of the stellar luminosity than for solar - type stars .",
    "these differences influence the atmospheric temperature profile and the production of potential biomarkers ( e.g. ozone , o@xmath10 ; segura et al .",
    "2003 ; segura et al . 2005 ) .",
    "h@xmath5o , ch@xmath11 , and co@xmath5 are highly sensitive to far - uv radiation , with photo - absorption cross - sections that overlap with ly@xmath0 , the strongest emission feature in the uv spectrum of an m - star .",
    "m - stars are known to display frequent and intense flare activity  @xcite , and the combination of uv photon and proton bombardment from a large flare may produce @xmath12  90% o@xmath10 depletions in an earth - like atmosphere  @xcite . despite the importance of understanding these host m - stars , their actual spectral and temporal behavior is not well known outside of a few active flare stars  @xcite .    gj  876 is an m4v star ( @xmath13  =  0.33  @xmath14 ) hosting a multi - planet system  @xcite .",
    "the four planets have masses ranging from super - jovian to super - earth ( @xmath15 = 2.64 @xmath16 , @xmath17 = 0.21 au ; @xmath18 = 0.83    0.86 @xmath16 , @xmath19 = 0.13 au ; @xmath20 @xmath2 6 @xmath21 , @xmath22 = 0.02 au ; @xmath23 = 12 @xmath21 , @xmath24 = 0.33 au ) , with gj 876b orbiting near the center of the hz .",
    "conditions favorable for the sustained presence of liquid surface water might therefore exist on any satellites of gj 876b .",
    "there is no present evidence for a bright remnant debris disk around gj 876  @xcite , and taken together with the slow stellar rotation ( 40  @xmath25  @xmath26  @xmath27  97 days ; rivera et al .",

    "other than the low - resolution spectra presented by  @xcite , there are very few nuv observations of gj 876 , and none that clearly detect emission from the star at far - uv wavelengths ( fuv ; 1150  @xmath32  @xmath33  @xmath32  2000   ) . as current m - dwarf models do not properly account for chromospheric and transition region emission , the lack of observational basis means that a crucial input to atmospheric models of planets orbiting low - mass stars is missing .",
    "the situation is sufficiently unclear that atmospheric modelers have taken widely varying approaches to estimating the uv radiation field incident upon the hz of m - dwarfs , from assuming the uv spectrum of a young flare star ( ad leo ; wordsworth et al .",
    "2010 ) to assuming an effective uv flux of zero  @xcite . as suggested by the latter authors , constraints from direct observation",

    "gj  876 was observed with cos and stis on 05 january 2012 and 12 november 2011 , respectively ( @xmath31 program i d 12464 ) .",
