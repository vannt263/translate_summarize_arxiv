    "physical sciences are replete with inequalities that inform us about the limits on allowed transformations . in classical equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the second law is an inequality that implies that the entropy produced in natural irreversible adiabatic processes is related to the heat .",
    "this second law is derived for systems in the neighborhood of thermal equilibrium , where temperature is well defined . in the absence of such simplifying assumptions ,",
    "entropy production inequalities have been proposed in place of the second law .    for completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) transformations , which characterize the dynamics of a system when it interacts with an independent environment , spohn s inequality bounds the entropy generated during the process .",
    "spohn s inequality uses relative entropy , defined as @xmath0 : = - { \\text{tr } } [ \\sigma_1 \\{\\log(\\sigma_2 ) - \\log(\\sigma_1)\\}]$ ] , and its contractivity ( or monotonicity ) @xmath1\\geq \\text{d } [ \\phi(\\sigma_1 ) \\vert \\phi(\\sigma_2)]$ ] for any cptp transformation @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 is replaced by the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) of the cptp transformation , i.e. , @xmath4 , the change in the von neumann entropy @xmath5 $ ] can be written as @xmath6.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical insight from eq .",
    "is that any state that is not the fixed point of the map generates a state transformation , accompanied by a change in entropy bounded by the equation above .",
    "the inequality above reduces to the standard form of the second law when the map represents an infinitesimal transformation about equilibrium , @xmath2 is the thermal map and hence @xmath7 is the thermal state .",
    "however , spohn s inequality and contractivity of relative entropy are restricted to cptp maps only , whose construction assumes that initial state of the system is independent of the environment , i.e. , the two are uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the applicability of eq .",
    "is rather limited . in this manuscript",
    ", we derive an entropy production bound without such simplifying assumptions , for generic initial system - environment state correlations .",
    "we present two important applications of the new monotonicity relationship .",
    "consider a quantum process of finite duration and the dynamics of the system between two intermediate points .",
    "this , in general , can not be described by a cptp map @xcite , because the system will be correlated with its environment at any intermediate point and hence breaks the assumption that the map is independent of the state of the system .",
    "we will refer to these correlations as initial or intermediate correlations ( ic ) .",
    "systems with ic are non - markovian , since ic are a record of the past interactions . since systems with ic @xcite can not always be described by cptp maps , a description for partial segments of a process could be very useful .",
    "for instance , imagine a qubit ( the system ) is reset by a cavity ( the environment ) after it performs some task @xcite .",
    "after the first reset , the system and the environment will be correlated for a finite amount of time .",
    "these correlations may not _ fully _ vanish by the time the qubit needs to be reset again .",
    "such protocols are common to many quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "consequently , non - markovian systems have drawn a lot of interest recently @xcite and the presence of ic can be verified using sophisticated witnesses @xcite , some of which have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .    the presence of ic marks the departure of cptp physics and hence the second law .",
    "many authors have opted for giving up cp in order to deal with dynamics in presence of ic and other non - markovian processes , leading breakdown of important physical laws .",
    "for instance , violation of the entropy production law recently demonstrated in a study of driven open quantum microcircuits @xcite .",
    "ic also have adverse affects on quantum information theory , which is normally derived assuming no ic @xcite .",
    "the holevo quantity and the data processing inequality were recently shown to not hold @xcite in this regime .",
    "ic are replete in fast quantum control experiments and in systems interacting with small environments , where it is expected that the standard rules of physics still apply . hence the apparent violation of these aforementioned laws are an indication of a breakdown of formalism . furthermore , given the prevalence of fast quantum control @xcite , this regime of dynamics is becoming ever more relevant for experiments .",
    "the monotonicity of relative entropy , which relies on complete positivity of the dynamics , has a wide array of application : @xmath8 giving up cp means giving up a many familiar bounds like holevo and data processing inequality . in this manuscript , using operational tool called _ superchannel _ @xcite to describe the dynamics of a system in presence of ic  , we derive bounds on the entropy production bound , and restore the quantum data processing inequality and the holevo quantity .",
    "we outline the framework of our problem in fig .",
    "[ outline ] .",
    "the framework of dynamics with initial or intermediate correlations ( ic ) .",
    "an state @xmath9 with ic is subjected to a cptp transformation @xmath10 which only acts on the system .",
    "the states of the environment conditioned by the measurement outcome are subjected to joint unitary dynamics along with the system state and at the final time , the ancilla state is discarded .",
    "the inequality that bounds the entropy of the final state @xmath11 for a choice of @xmath10 is presented in the text.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "we imagine a quantum process wherein the system is correlated with its environment . we denote the total state of the system and the environment as @xmath9 , and the marginal states as @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the system and the environment respectively .",
    "an operation @xmath10 is performed on the system , preparing the quantum state in any desired state , and conditioning the environmental state to the outcome of the system preparation . following this ,",
    "the system and environment are subjected to joint unitary evolution .",
    "the final state of the system namely @xmath11 , is recovered by tracing over the environment at the final time .",
    "we wish to bound the entropy production of this process .    in a series of papers @xcite these dynamics",
    "were approached in an operational manner .",
    "the reasoning goes like this : suppose we want to prepare the system into a desired pure state @xmath14 using a specific operation , defined as @xmath15 . since the operation acts on the system state , the joint state after the operation is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the identity map on the environment .",
    "the environmental state @xmath18 is conditioned on the fact that the system was prepared in state @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 will depend on the choice of operation @xmath20 .",
    "hence , for a general quantum operation , we should care not just about the output of the preparation but the preparation procedure itself .    after preparing the system",
    ", we let it evolve , which may include an interaction with the environment , and measure the output state @xmath11 .",
    "the key observation in describing this dynamics is that the variable of the problem ( that we are free to choose ) is the operation @xmath10 , which can be _ any _ cptp operation .",
    "for instance , it can be a projective operation as in the example above , or a unitary operation .",
    "the corresponding output to @xmath10 is the final state @xmath11 .",
    "therefore to describe the dynamics with need a map joins these two elements : @xmath21 = \\sigma'$ ] .",
    "map @xmath22 is called a superchannel @xcite , which is defined in terms of matrix indices as @xmath23 , see @xcite for details .",
    "it is completely positive , but not trace preserving @xcite .",
    "the superchannel s action is defined over any cptp transformation @xmath10 . therefore superchannels provides the most general description for the dynamics between any two time - steps @xcite .",
    "moreover , such superchannels can be fully determined via tomographic methods @xcite . yet",
    ", there are several ways in which superchannels differ from the familiar quantum operations relating to the fact that they transform operations to states .",
    "firstly , superchannels are completely positive , and hence have an operator sum representation .",
    "since quantum operations are represented by trace @xmath24 matrices while quantum states are unit trace operators , superchannels do not preserve trace .",
    "for every superchannel @xmath22 , this is trivially fixed by introducing another superchannel which acts on @xmath25 , a unit trace operators , and yields the state @xmath11 . since the trace preserving superchannel is a composition of two cp maps , @xmath22 and a map that transforms @xmath10 to a state @xmath26 , the new superchannel is also cp , and now tp .",
    "we will refer to this modified superchannel as @xmath27 .",
    "before we present the generalization of the second law like inequality , we need a non - equilibrium steady operation ( neso ) @xmath28 that looks something like @xmath29 = \\mathcal{e}$ ] . however , since a superchannel transforms @xmath30 quantum operations to @xmath31 density matrices this is not possible . in other words",
    "@xmath27 does not have a fixed point . for states without ic , the study of entropy production using quantum relative entropy compares the given state to a reference state . by extension , we seek a neso to compare our operation against . hence , we seek equilibria @xmath28 such that @xmath29 = \\mathfrak{e}$ ] , where the definition of @xmath7 has to be clarified .",
    "we clarify this by examining the superchannel for the familiar case of no ic , since , in this case the ness state is well defined .",
    "any generalized solution will have to also satisfy this special case . here",
    ", the superchannel is written as @xmath32 , with its action defined as @xmath33 = \\phi ( \\mathcal{a } ( \\sigma))$ ] .",
    "let us then define an neso @xmath28 such that its action on the system state yields @xmath34 , such that this state is preserved by the rest of the dynamics , namely @xmath35 .",
    "this step is just the condition that for a given channel and any initial state , the operation that replaces this initial state with a ness state is a neso .",
    "note that since the outcome of the neso @xmath28 is @xmath7 for all initial states of the system @xmath12 , the correct neso should be written in the uncorrelated case as @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt this as the neso , with one additional condition relating to the definition of the state discussed below . from the information theoretic perspective",
    ", it is clear that @xmath37 has the same information as @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the normalized superchannel acting on neso , @xmath38 = \\mathfrak{e}$ ] , preserves all information .    in the case with ic , the neso results in transforming the state of the system to an as yet undetermined state @xmath7 , whereas it transforms the state of the environment to @xmath39 .",
    "the ness state @xmath7 is defined as a state that is invariant to the subsequent dynamics , namely @xmath40 .",
    "physically this implies that the definition of neso @xmath28 , is one which  forgets \" the reduced state of the system and  replaces \" it with a state that is a fixed point of the subsequent quantum channel . just like before",
    ", the neso @xmath28 can be made to have unit trace by dividing through by @xmath24 , namely @xmath41 .",

    "this is depicted on the left .",
    "however , instead of representing the quantum operation , consider the stinespring dilation of the operation , wherein it is represented as a joint unitary action on an ancilla : @xmath44 . since the input is a pure state and",

    "the ness @xmath59 yields @xmath60 this equation , for transformations between the neighborhood of gibbs states ( so that von neumann entropy can be associated with thermodynamic entropy and temperature is well defined ) , recovers the clausius inequality .",
    "contractivity of relative entropy has two more important applications , whose generalizations we discuss as applications of our new formalism .",
    "the first is the quantum data processing inequality ( qdpi ) , which informs us that quantum channels do not increase the mutual information between subsystems .",

    "not - completely - positive ( ncp ) maps are the alternative to the superchannel formalism , however , they suffer ambiguity in terms of their operational interpretation , while the superchannel is operationally sound . moreover , using the superchannel formalism we demonstrate that there is no need to give up complete - positivity . here",
    "we generalize qdpi for quantum superchannels .    the setting to generalize the quantum data processing inequality to states with ic .",

    "these states are subjected to a joint quantum operation @xmath65 .",
    "after this , the states evolve under the influence of joint unitary operations , @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "since the initial states have ic , the dynamics is not guaranteed to be cptp .",

    ", we derive the correct form of qdpi , presented in eq .",
    "[ final_qdpi].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    qdpi bounds the mutual information between subsystems at the output of a quantum channel to be no larger than the mutual information between the subsystems at the input . this inequality is a consequence of monotonicity . in the presence of ic ,",
    "qdpi does not seem to hold .",
    "consider the scenario in fig .",
    "[ qdpi_fig ] for instance .",
    "the physical system consists of two separate quantum systems @xmath68 and @xmath69 , initially correlated with their respective environments .",

    "one might seek to bound the mutual information of the final bipartite state .",
    "intuitively we expect that this mutual information can only be related to a property of the bipartite measurement @xmath70 . to prove this intuition , we simply study the following form of our new second law , namely @xmath72   \\geq \\\\",

    "this fully resolves the question as to whether initial correlations violate qdpi @xcite .",
    "the second application is related to bounding the mutual information between two communicating parties , alice and bob .",
    "the accessible information @xmath78 , which quantifies the amount of classical information that can be communicated using a quantum channel @xmath2 is bounded by the holevo quantity @xmath79 . to communicate codewords @xmath80 with probability @xmath81",

    "we note that in @xcite , the correlations that cause the dynamics to be not cp are shared between alice and bob , causing the subsequent measurements performed by bob to be not cp .",
    "our formalism readily accommodates this minor difference in the way the problem has been setup .",
    "in this section , we discuss the cost of implementing an operation . applying a non - unitary operation @xmath10 requires unitarily interacting the system with an ancilla .",
    "the ancilla can be taken to be a pure state initially , and can be discarded after the interaction . however , this interaction generate correlations between the system and the ancilla , and thus discarding the ancilla has entropic costs .",
    "we will address this issue of entropy production in the ancilla by writing another second law like inequality for such dynamics . to address the ancilla",
    ", we dilate @xmath10 to a unitary in a higher dimensional space .",

    "the set of isometry @xmath93 just as rich as the set of operations @xmath10 .",
    "various choices of @xmath91 and @xmath90 correspond to different operations .",
