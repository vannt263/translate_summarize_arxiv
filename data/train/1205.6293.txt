    "in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a globular cluster ( gc ) , blue straggler stars ( bsss ) define a sub - population located along the main - sequence ( ms ) in a position brighter and bluer than the current ms - turnoff ( to ) . for this reason",
    "these objects are thought to be hydrogen burning stars more massive than a typical to star .",
    "two physical mechanisms are thought to be responsible for their formation : mass - transfer in a binary system @xcite , and direct stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "since collisions are more frequent in regions of higher density , the relative importance of the different formation channels could depend on the environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "discovered for the first time by  @xcite in the external regions of the gc m3 , it was with the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the 8-meter class telescopes that it became possible to search for bsss in dense cluster cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bsss have been found in any properly imaged gc @xcite and they are studied also in dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "since the bss formation mechanisms seems to be tightly connected with the cluster internal dynamics , these stars are commonly recognized as ideal test particles to investigate the impact of dynamics on stellar evolution in different environmental conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting example comes from the discovery of two distinct sequences of bsss in the core of m30 @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that each of the two sequences is populated by bsss originated by one of the two formation channels , both triggered by the collapse of the cluster core a few gyr ago . on the other side ,  @xcite",
    "suggest that most bsss , even those found in cluster cores , come from binary systems  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless the parent binaries may themselves have been affected by dynamical encounters .",
    "systematic studies of the bss populations in gcs have shown that in most cases their radial distribution is bimodal , with a high peak in the cluster centre , a trough at intermediate radii and a rising branch in the external regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "* ) suggest that the observed shape of the bss radial distribution depends on the relative contribution of col - bsss and the efficiency of the dynamical friction , that progressively segregates objects more massive than the average ( as bsss and their progenitors ) towards the cluster centre .",
    "very interesting exceptions are the cases of @xmath1 centauri @xcite , ngc 2419 @xcite and pal 14 @xcite , where the bss radial distribution is completely flat .",
    "this fact indicates that in these clusters the dynamical friction was not effective yet in segregating bsss toward the centre of the potential well .",
    "interestingly enough ngc 2419 and pal 14 are among the most remote gcs in the galaxy , lying at a distance from the galactic centre @xmath0 kpc .",

    ", a standard daophotii @xcite point spread function ( psf ) fitting procedure , including allframe @xcite , was adopted to obtain instrumental magnitudes and colours for all measurable stars in the wfpc2 fields .",

    "the psf was modelled on each image using a number ( between 40 and 80 ) of isolated and well sampled stars , adopting the psf / daophotii routine .",
    "a first psf fitting was then performed on every image using daophotii / allstar , while allframe was used to obtain a fine measure of the star magnitudes . for each star",

    "we obtain an absolute age of 10.5 gyr for eridanus and pal 4 , and 11 gyr for pal 3 and am 1 , confirming that these clusters are younger than the inner - halo gcs ( s99 and d08 ) .",
    "the location of the to , defined as the hottest point along the ms in the theoretical isochrone of each cluster , is also marked in figure [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "this was used to compute the shifts in magnitude and colour that , after taking into account also the different distance moduli and reddenings , are necessary to co - add the four cmds .",
    "the result is impressive ( see figure [ fig_cmd_all ] ) : the rgb morphologies of the four clusters are in full agreement and consistent with a small metallicity difference among their stellar populations .",
    "indeed , the combined cmd mimics a highly homogeneous single - metallicity population .",
