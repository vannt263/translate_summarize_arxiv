    "now that the existence of supermassive black holes in agn seems fairly secure , perhaps the next most fundamental questions are the sources of energy and the nature of the accretion flow in the various classes of objects .",
    "historically ( see begelman , blandford and rees 1984 for an early review ) it was thought that the optical / uv continuum ( or  big blue bump \" ) in quasars ( hereafter : and broad line radio galaxies ) represents thermal radiation from some sort of cool optically thick accretion flow .",
    "radio galaxies did nt show this component , so were posited to be  nonthermal agn \" with hot radiatively inefficient accretion , at a very low rate ; in these cases the the jet power would derive from the hole rotation rather than release of gravitational potential energy from accretion .",
    "these arguments took a surprising turn when it was realized that many radio galaxies do have the quasar - like nucleithat are invisible from our line of sight .",
    "one fanaroff - riley ii ( edge - brightened , very luminous ) radio galaxy , 3c234 , was shown in 1982 to have quasar features ( broad permitted emission lines and big blue bump ) in polarized light ( antonucci 1982 , 1984 ; antonucci 1993 for a review ) .",
    "thus 3c234 does have the  thermal \" optical / uv emission , which is only visible via scattering .",
    "many other examples have been shown subsequently ( e.g.  hines and wills 1993 ; young et al .",
    "some invocations of the unified model postulated that this was generally true of the fr ii ( powerful , edge - brightened ) class ( e.g. barthel 1989 ) .",
    "3c234 has powerful high - ionization narrow lines , consistent with its being a hidden quasar .",
    "however it is still contentious how those fr iis with weak and/or low ionization narrow emission lines fit in ( singal 1993 ; laing 1994 ; gopal - krishna et al .  1996 ; antonucci 2001 ) .",
    "the situation is even less clear for the fr i galaxies , almost all of which have undetectable or low - ionization emission lines .    for radio galaxies with no observable high - ionization narrow emission line region present ,",
    "there is no _ a priori _ evidence for the presence of a quasar .",
    "these could still have a quasar nucleus , but any narrow line region would need to be mostly obscured as well .",
    "in fact there is some evidence that the high ionization narrow emission lines are partially obscured in many 3c radio galaxies ( he s et al .",
    "1993 ) . in ngc 4945 and many other ordinary looking galaxies ,",
    "the only present evidence for a hidden agn is in the hard x - ray ( e.g. madejski et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to summarize , _ many _ fr ii radio galaxies fall into the apparently weak , low - ionization emission line category .",
    "_ most _ of the fr i radio galaxies do as well .",
    "these spectra have been described as `` optically dull . '' quite recently , chiaberge et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) have shown that _ among these optically dull sources of both fr types _ , a majority show optical point sources in hst images , and of course more might do so with better imaging data .",
    "note that their result seems surprising at first : one might have guessed that those with stronger high - ionization spectra would have the point sources , but the opposite is true .",
    "chiaberge et al .  argue that those with detectable optical point sources can not in general have thick obscuring tori on .",
    "the reason is , _ if _ the point sources are truly nuclear , then we can see to the very center in most of these objects .",
    "these radio galaxies are effectively selected by an isotropic emission property - the radio lobe flux - so the source orientations should have an isotropic distribution .",
    "that is , the radio axes should be randomly oriented with respect to our line of sight .",
    "since we can see optical point sources in most optically dull objects , most lines of sight to their nuclei must be unobscured in general .",
    "recall that in the chiaberge et al .",
    "picture , the hst optical point sources are the bases of the synchrotron jets which emit in the radio . as they point out , one caveat must be given with their line of argument .",
    "it is possible that obscuring tori exist below the hst resolution , and hide the nucleus and the very innermost region of the conical jet .",
    "for example , their optical point sources may really be jet emission on @xmath0 pc scales , and optical big blue bump sources are much smaller .",
    "a torus might be large enough to obscure the latter while still allowing the pc scale jet emission to be seen over the top .    in the chiaberge et al .",
    "scenario the optical point sources represent synchrotron emission from the bases of the jets . in support of this idea",
    ", those authors show that the optical fluxes correlate roughly with the core radio fluxes at 6  cm",
    ". it should be easy to check this : the relationship should tighten up substantially using millimeter fluxes instead of those at 6  cm .",
    "it is very important to remember that some narrow line radio galaxies of _ both _ fr types do have strong high ionization emission lines , and in some cases definitive spectropolarimetric evidence for a hidden `` thermal '' nucleus . in general such objects",
    "have no detectable optical point source .",
    "they behave instead like seyfert 2 nuclei , with just spatially resolved scattered light and the extended narrow line region directly visible .",
    "our goal is to determine robustly which if any radio galaxies _ lack _ a hidden `` thermal '' ( optical / uv continuum ) nucleus .",
    "this is crucial for agn theory since it would prove the existence of an accretion mode different from that in quasars .",
    "in particular , current wisdom would posit a very low accretion rate and a very low radiative efficiency , that is , some variant of the advection dominated accretion flow for those radio galaxies .",
    "then by default the enormous kinetic luminosity of the radio jets would be attributed to black hole rotational energy .",
    "how can we tell whether or not a hidden nucleus is present ?",
    "one method is via the hard x - rays .",
    "many hidden agn that are not compton - thick have been discovered with x - ray observations . some references to penetrating x - rays in optically dull sources",
    "are gathered in antonucci 2001 ; ngc4945 is a spectacular example ( e.g. madejski et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our approach here is to look instead for reradiation of the absorbed light from any hidden quasar - like nucleus by the dusty obscuring matter ( torus ) .",
    "modulo factors of order unity , the various models of the obscuring tori predict that the `` waste heat '' from the obscuring matter will emerge in the mid - ir , and that this emission is _ roughly isotropic _ in all but the highest inclination cases .",
    "( note that this assumption is the weakest point of our project , but that the various torus models predict it is true _ to within a factor of a few _ : pier and krolik 1992 , 1993 ; granato et al .",
    "1997 ; efstathiou and rowan - robinson 1995 ; a related model in konigl and kartje 1994 should also be consulted ; cen a is discussed specifically in alexander et al 1999 ) .",
    "we are making this test for hidden quasars using the keck i telescope s mid - ir instrument ( the `` lws '' ) .",
    "this is the only way to isolate the nucleus well , and to achieve the required sensitivity .",
    "here we show the power of the technique , and demonstrate the existence of at least one `` nonthermal '' agn .",
    "in figure 1 we present a diffraction limited mid - ir image of the nuclear source in 3c 405 ( cyg a ) , obtained with the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) instrument at the keck i telescope .",
    "all data were taken with the 11.7@xmath1 m filter , which has an @xmath2 m bandpass from 11.2 to 12.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "the image was shown previously in whysong and antonucci ( 2001 ) .",
    "the nucleus of 3c 405 was imaged at 11.7@xmath1 m with keck i / lws on 1999 september 30 .",
    "the chop / nod throw was set to 10 \" in order to allow imaging of larger scale extended structure ; this places the chop beam off the chip , which has a 10 \" field .",
    "we do not report on structures larger than the 10 \" chop distance .",
    "the images were dithered in a 5 position box pattern , 2 \" to a side , with 53.1 seconds on - source for the positive image per dither position .",
    "the entire 5-position exposure was repeated three times , for a total on - source time of 796.6 seconds .",
    "data were processed by subtracting all background chop / nod frames , shifting each dithered image to the correct position , and coadding all dither images .",
    "morphology is extended , with structure to the east and southeast of the nucleus ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the standard star was alpha ari , with a fwhm of 0.27 \" .",
    "our 11.7@xmath1 m image and a partial spectral energy distribution are shown in figs .  1 and 5 .",
    "for comparison , the iras ( large aperture ) data for cygnus a are listed in table 3 .",
    "the high resolution mid - ir data on cen a also come from the keck i telescope .",
    "data were obtained on our behalf by randy campbell on 28 june 2002 .",
    "three filters were used : the 11.7 @xmath1 m filter with 1 @xmath1 m bandpass , a wider `` sic '' filter centered at 11.7 @xmath1 m but with a 2.4 @xmath1 m bandwidth , and the 17.75 @xmath1 m filter with a @xmath3 m bandwidth .",
    "the standard star was sigma sco , a multiple star which was partially resolved so that it was necessary to increase the synthetic aperture to 2.24 arcsec in order to include all components .",
    "no photometric data are available for sigma sco at wavelengths longer than m , so we extrapolated to longer wavelengths using the rayleigh - jeans approximation .",
    "the cen a images show only an unresolved source in all filters .",
    "photometric calibration results are f(@xmath4m)@xmath5 jy , f(sic)@xmath6 jy with @xmath7 arcsec fwhm resolution , and f(17.75  @xmath1m)@xmath8 jy with @xmath9 arcsec fwhm resolution .",
    "since cen a is so close , there are published data for relatively small physical apertures .",
    "a small physical aperture is key , because for both cen a and m87 , the large - aperture ( e.g. iras , iso ) fluxes are much larger than that from the nucleus .",
    "but the much higher resolution keck data isolate a nuclear point source with size @xmath10 pc at @xmath4 m and @xmath11 pc at @xmath12 m given a distance of 3.1 mpc .",
    "we will assume that this is mostly dust emission heated by the nucleus .",
    "this is consistent with the 10 - 20 micron nuclear spectrum taken by isocam cvf in a @xmath13 aperture ( mirabel et al",
    ".  1999 , reproduced here as fig .",
    "3 ) . in fact , our 11.7 @xmath1 m flux is in good agreement with that of the spectrum , suggesting that fig .",
    "3 is in fact the nuclear spectrum .    for comparison ,",
    "the published , larger aperture mid - ir fluxes are much higher .",
    "the cen a central region flux has been measured in the mid - ir by grasdelen and joyce ( 1976 ) .",
    "their 3.5 `` aperture has the same flux as the 5.2 '' aperture , so there is a compact source surrounded by a region of low or zero flux .",
    "the 3.5 \" aperture corresponds to @xmath1450  pc , and the enclosed flux is given as @xmath15 jy at 11 microns , and 4.3 jy at 12.6 microns . the iras 12.6@xmath1 m flux measurement is even higher at 13.3 jy .      here a new high - resolution keck i image is also crucial .",
    "we obtained this data for m87 on 2000 january 18 .",
    "the observation was made in chop - nod mode using a small 3.5 \" amplitude so as to keep both the object and chop beams on the ccd chip .",
    "the 11.7 @xmath1 m filter was used , with a 1@xmath1 m bandpass .",
    "integration time was 96 seconds per dither each for positive and negative ( background ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to a loss of guiding , the positive nucleus image was only fully imaged in one dither frame .",
    "however , we are still left with two independent images , both strong pointlike detections .",
    "our measurement was taken from the better placed of the two .",
    "beta and and mu uma were used as standards for photometric calibration , yielding a flux scale of 0.0874 and 0.0931 mjy/(adu / s ) and fwhm of 0.33 \" and 0.31 \" respectively .",
    "this calibration for the unresolved nuclear component in m87 results in a flux of 13 + /-",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by systematic errors in the background subtraction ; we adopt a value of 13 mjy .",
    "a synthetic aperture of 0.96 arcsec was used , but the source is unresolved so the flux is insensitive to the aperture .",
    "again we note that the large aperture fluxes are much higher .",
    "in particular the iras fluxes ( moshir et al .",
    "1990 ) are 231@xmath1637 mjy at 12@xmath1 m , @xmath17241 mjy at 25@xmath1 m , and 393@xmath1651 mjy at 60@xmath1 m .",
    "fig 1 shows the sed for cen a , combining all the @xmath18 \" measurements . for agn which show the quasar - like optical nucleus in scattered light only ,",
    "the mid - ir emission is typically two orders of magnitude greater than the ( scattered ) optical light . for cen a",
    "the situation is similar , but with a slight modification ( bailey et al .",
    "1996 ; hough et al .",
    "1987 ; antonucci and barvainis 1990 ; alexander et al .",
    "the ratio is inflated by absorption of the _ pc _ scale scattered optical light by the kpc dust lane famous from photographs .    at 2u , a highly polarized point source indicates detection of a @xmath19  pc scale reflection region .",
    "the near - ir reflected light from pc scales penetrates the _ kpc _ scale dust lane which has only moderate optical depth .",
    "this situation was deduced for 3c323.1 and cen a by antonucci and barvainis ( 1990 ) .",
    "the pc scale dust screen can be consistently identified with the cold absorber seen in the x - ray spectrum , which has column density @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "additional optical and near - ir scattered light on kpc scales has been mapped and disucssed by capetti et al 2000 and marconi et al 2000 .",
    "the case of cen a shows that even radio galaxies with weak or low - ionization lines ( the  optically dull \" ones ) can have hidden type 1 nuclei .",
    "others can be found in e.g. ekers and simkin 1983 and sambruna et al .",
    "2000 .    to show the level of the reflected light in the nuclear region",
    ", we have plotted the value at 2 microns rather than that in the optical ( which is highly absorbed ) . the k - band nuclear flux with starlight subtracted ( marconi et al .",
    "2000 ) is f(k ) @xmath19 3 mjy , and @xmath22 ergs / sec for a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "the sed in figure 2 shows that the mid - ir luminosity of the nucleus is much larger than the optical / near - ir value , as expeted .",
    "this is consistent with all other reflected - light objects .",
    "the value of the mid - ir flux quoted above is @xmath193.5 jy at 11.7 microns , interpolated from measurements at two nearby wavelengths .",
    "the corresponding @xmath23 is @xmath24 erg / sec . assuming a normal quasar sed ( e.g. sanders et al 1989 ; barvainis et al .",
    "1990 ) , that translates to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath25 ergs / sec for the hidden agn .",
    "the nature of the mid - ir emission is important .",
    "the sed has been fit to a synchrotron self - compton model ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2001 ) which would lead to a classification for cen a as a  misaligned bl lac \" .",
    "however , the fit was to the mid - ir continuum slope instead of the different iso bands because the latter were heavily affected by absorption and emission features ( m. chiaberge 2001 , private communication ) . small aperture mid - ir spectra show pah and si features ( figure 3 ) , and the sed in @xmath26 apertures is consistent with predominantly dust rather than synchrotron ( alexander et al .",
    "1999 ; note also that the isocam cvf flux from the mirabel et al .",
    "1999 spectrum is consistent with our 11.7 @xmath1 m measurement , suggesting that the spectrum is representative of our smaller aperture ) .",
    "these features indicate that most of the mid - ir flux is thermal emission as expected for the torus model .",
    "this radio galaxy is on the fr i - ii borderline , both in morphology and in radio power ( owen et al .",
    "it is one of the majority of fr i radio galaxies with an optical / uv point source ( chiaberge et al .  1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the optical point source is tentatively ascribed to synchrotron radiation associated with the radio core ( see ford & tsvetanov 1999 , as well as the chiaberge et al.papers ) .",
    "however it s not known whether this light is highly polarized , or whether broad emission lines are strong in either total or polarized optical / uv flux .",
    "our small @xmath27 arcsec fwhm beam isolates the innermost @xmath28pc in m87 . the enclosed 11.7@xmath1 m flux in an 0.6 \" synthetic aperture is 15 mjy ; this aperture matches that used for cen a in physical size .",
    "the flux measured in this way is much lower than the large aperture measurements in the literature .",
    "published large - aperture data leave plenty of room for waste heat from a hidden agn , but our data do not ( fig .  1 )",
    "the mid - ir luminosity @xmath23 is only of order that in the optical rather than much greater as for the hidden agn sources .",
    "in fact , much or all of the mid - ir flux could simply be synchrotron radiation associated with the innermost part of the jet , so the measured flux is an upper limit to the dust luminosity . note that this outcome for m87 is just what chiaberge et al .  implicitly predicted .",
    "unless the nuclear dust is too obscured to emit in the mid - ir , this rules out a powerful hidden nucleus .",
    "the observed 11.7@xmath1 m flux corresponds to @xmath29 erg / sec , for a distance of 15 mpc .",
    "suppose the mid - ir core is in fact all dust emission .",
    "for the sed for the pg quasar composite of sanders et al .",
    "1989 , a bolometric luminosity of @xmath30 ergs / sec is expected . for comparison , a lower limit to the jet kinetic luminosity in m87 is @xmath31 erg / sec ( owen et al .  2000 ) , so the jet is by far the dominant channel for energy release.if correct , this suggests that m87 is the true  misaligned bl lac . \"",
    "published adaf models ( reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ) predict very low ir - optical - uv luminosities compared with those in the radio and x - ray .",
    "our 11.7@xmath1 m point is about equal to the optical value , but certainly our 11.7@xmath1 m point may be partially or completely jet emission .",
    "this is a very powerful fr ii radio galaxy at a redshift of 0.056 .",
    "it has strong high - ionization narrow lines , suggestive of a hidden agn .",
    "a broad mg ii 2800 emission line is detectable in total flux ( antonucci et al .",
    "1994 ) . that line may or may not be highly polarized , and thus scattered from a hidden nucleus .",
    "several detailed papers report spectroscopic and spectropolarimatric data ( goodrich and miller 1989 ; tadhunter et al .  1994 ;",
    "shaw and tadhunter 1994 ; vestergaard and barthel 1993 ; stockton et al .",
    "1994 ; see also tadhunter et al .",
    "2000 and thornton et al .",
    "1999 - and there are several others ) , culminating in ogle et al .  1997 , which shows an extremely broad h - alpha line in polarized flux .",
    "it is virtually invisible in total flux because its great width makes it hard to distinguish from continuum emission .",
    "a nuclear point source in the near - ir was noted by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , but they do nt seem to have considered hot dust emission for this excess over the extrapolation from the optical light , as we believe .    a powerful hidden nucleus should manifest a mid - ir dust luminosity much larger than the observed optical luminosity . however for this object and m87 ( and virtually all others ! ) the only ir data available were taken with very large beam sizes .",
    "we ( and radomski et al .  2002)isolate the core much better with the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 kpc ) resolution provided by the keck i telescope , and find a nuclear flux of @xmath34mjy .",
    "an uncertainty here derives from the extended emission , but flux as a function of aperture size does flatten out for apertures larger than the seeing disk , so the 0.96 \" measurement should be approximately correct ( see table 2 )",
    ". however , we ca nt be sure from this observation alone that the emission is on pc scales . since the emission is powerful and at the relatively short wavelength of 11.7@xmath1 m",
    ", it is very likely that this comes from nuclear dust rather than a starburst .",
    "it is entirely possible that the extended emission is thermal dust even at radii up to 1 kpc .",
    "the temperature of nuclear - heated dust can be estimated according to barvainis 1988 . adopting a hubble constant of 75 km / s mpc , the @xmath23 luminosity at 11.7@xmath1",
    "m is @xmath35 erg / sec .",
    "if the intrinsic sed is similar to those of pg quasars ( sanders et al .  1989 ) , the 11.7@xmath1 m value implies a bolometric luminosity of 16.5 @xmath23 ( 11.7@xmath1 m ) @xmath36 erg / sec .",
    "an optical luminosity of @xmath37 erg / s produces a dust temperature of @xmath38k at a 500pc radius .",
    "a similar calculation of the dust temperature was done by ( radomski et al .",
    "2002 ) , yielding a slightly higher results ( 150 k ) due to a higher estimate of the optical luminosity . among the uncertainties are the nuclear uv luminosity and the possiblility of single photon heating .",
    "the iras ( large aperture , see table 3 ) dust spectrum is quite cool , suggesting a large starburst contribution .",
    "extended emission is seen in our image at 11.7@xmath1 m .",
    "the core ca nt be exactly separated from the extensions ( see table 2 ) , but we can estimate around 60 mjy for the nuclear dust .",
    "1 shows the cyg a 11.7@xmath1 m image , and fig .",
    "5 shows a partial spectral energy distribution .",
    "the nuclear luminosity @xmath23 at 11.7@xmath1 m is 10 times higher than that at 0.5@xmath39 .",
    "the latter wavelength needs two roughly canceling corrections : subtraction of optical light from the host galaxy , and dereddening ( ogle et al .",
    "the starbust contribution to the nuclear 11.7@xmath1 m emission is expected to be small , but this should be checked with a spectral slope measurement .    the conclusion is simple and expected from prior evidence : cyg a has a moderately powerful hidden nucleus .    as noted above , the estimated bolometric luminosity is @xmath40 erg / s . for comparison the jet power",
    "is estimated several different ways ( carilli and barthel 1996 ; sikora 2001 ; punsly 2001 ) .",
    "the values are rough , but generally lie in the @xmath41 ergs / sec range .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that jet power and optical / uv luminosity are often comparable in double radio quasars ( e.g. , falcke 1995 ) .",
    "thus this is a moderate luminosity broad line radio galaxy with a very high luminosity radio source .",
    "it has in fact been inferred already that cygnus a is an over - achiever in the radio ( carilli and barthel 1996 ; barthel and arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "this is well explained qualitatively by the fact that it is the only known fr ii radio source in a rich x - ray - emitting cluster .",
    "a goal of this paper is to detect thermal ir bumps , often in the presence of a synchrotron continuum . in general",
    "the sed sampling is limited for our targets . even in cases with convincing dust emission ,",
    "the dust component is not very well isolated in the infrared sed .",
    "thus we thought it would be helpful to show a well observed object which clearly isolates a nonthermal infrared bump from a broadband nonthermal component .",
    "blazar radio sources are typically dominated over most of their sed by variable synchrotron emission ( and/or inverse compton bump in the x - ray - @xmath42-ray region ) .",
    "this means that in powerful cases , relatively few continuum components of emission are important for the sed . for example ,",
    "starlight and dust warmed to tens of k by stars are relatively weak .",
    "thus the infrared consists almost entirely of the broadband nonthermal and the ( relatively ) narrow band thermal components .",
    "the sed , shown in fig .",
    "4 , is that of 3c 273 ( data from robson et al .",
    "it can be referred to while assessing the other seds in this paper .",
    "radio lobe emission is fairly isotropic , so it s easy to make lists of double radio sources that are nearly unbiased with respect to orientation . the visibility of optical point sources in _ most _ of the optically dull ( weak or low ionization emission line )",
    "galaxies show that there are no @xmath43 parsec scale tori present which are able to obscure the unresolved optical sources in those cases ( chiaberge et al .  1999 , 2000 ) . whatever the nature of the m87 optical point source , we know it s small from the variability on year timescales .",
    "the same would apply to the other optically dull nuclei if they vary as m87 does .",
    "this would strengthen the chiaberge et al .",
    "argument that we have unobscured sightlines nearly all the way to the central engines .    since the m87 optical / uv flux is quite variable ( e.g. , tsvetanov et al .",
    "1998 ) jet synchrotron emission is a possibility . by correlating the radio synchrotron core fluxes and the optical point source fluxes in fr i radio galaxies generally , chiaberge et al .",
    "( 1999 ) infer that the latter are in fact likely to be beamed synchrotron sources .",
    "crucial tests of the nature of the optical point sources can be made with spectroscopy and polarimetry .",
    "we hope to do this with adaptive optics , excluding most of the starlight that dominates in arcsec apertures .    however , a large minority of low ionization fr i and fr ii radio galaxies show no point source , and are similar in this way to agn with hidden nuclei .",
    "in fact the closest fr i , cen a , _ does _ have a big molecular torus ( see fig .  2 of rydbeck et al .",
    "1993 ! ) , and substantial evidence for a hidden nucleus as well ( see references cited earlier ) . as a working hypothesis",
    "we might suppose that the same is true for all those without detectable optical pointlike nuclei .",
    "( of course sensitivity of the optical / uv observations also enters in . )",
    "thus the fr i family is heterogeneous : some contain hidden optical / uv nuclei and some do not .",
    "it s been difficult to find fr i objects with strong evidence for hidden agn , but in fact at least a few are known to be quasar - like from direct spectroscopy ( 3c120 is well known ; see also lara et al .",
    "1999 and sarazin et al .",
    "1999 ) . the infrared peaks in some blazars such as 3c 66a are clearly distinct from the radio synchrotron , providing further evidence for fr i objects with hidden thermal emission",
    ". therefore the  nonthermal \" model _ does not _ apply to all optically dull or low ionization radio galaxies , or to all fr i galaxies .",
    "the fr class has no apparent _ direct _ relation to the mode of energy production , consistent with much recent evidence that fr is behave very much like fr iis at vlbi scales .",
    "we will understand this better after the completion of our mid - ir program .",
    "finally we reiterate an assumption in our program : we assume that any mid - ir dust emission is isotropic to within a factor of a few .",

    "<S> it is widely believed that the optical / uv continuum of quasars ( the `` big blue bump '' ) represents optically thick thermal emission from accretion onto a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> narrow line radio galaxies do nt show such a component directly , and were historically thought for that reason to be rotation - powered , with large kinetic luminosity in the radio jets but very little accretion or optical radiation . </S>",
    "<S> when the unified model came along , identifying at least some narrow line radio galaxies as hidden quasars , the compelling observational motivation for this radio galaxy scenario lost some of its force . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is far from clear that all narrow line radio galaxies contain hidden quasar nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the clear sign of a hidden quasar inside a radio galaxy is the appearance of quasar spectral features in its polarized ( scattered ) light . </S>",
    "<S> however that observational test requires suitably placed scattering material to act as a mirror , allowing us to see the nuclear light . </S>",
    "<S> a rather robust and more general test for a hidden quasar is to look for the predicted high mid - ir luminosity from the nuclear obscuring matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear waste heat is detected and well isolated in the nearest narrow line radio galaxy , cen a. this confirms other indications that cen a _ does _ contain a modest quasar - like nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> however we show here that m87 _ does not _ : at high spatial resolution , the mid - ir nucleus is seen to be very weak , and consistent with simple synchrotron emission from the base of the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> this fairly robustly establishes that there are `` real '' narrow line radio galaxies , without the putative accretion power , and with essentially all the luminosity in kinetic form .    </S>",
    "<S> next we show the intriguing mid - ir morphology of cygnus a , reported previously by us and later discussed in detail by radomski et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of this mid - ir emission is consistent with reprocessing by a hidden quasar , known to exist from spectropolarimetry by ogle et al .  </S>",
