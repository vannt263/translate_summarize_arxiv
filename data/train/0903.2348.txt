    "controlling the magnetic order of materials is a long standing goal of applied solid state physics , with a tremendous impact on the information technology industry .",
    "the onset of a magnetic moment in a transition metal atom arises primarily out of intra - atomic hund s rules , which are poorly structure - dependent even in a solid .",
    "interatomic magnetic order , however , depends very critically on structure . as is well known , for example , bcc fe is a prototypical ferromagnetic metal , but the magnetic properties do change with the crystal structure and the fe - fe interatomic distance , so that bulk fe can support afm configurations in the metastable fcc structure.@xcite low - dimensional and mesoscopic systems offer new possibilities to control the magnetic order of fe . in particular , the heteroepitaxial growth of fe films and nanowires on non - magnetic transition metal substrates is expected to yield novel magnetic structures due to the combined effects of a ) lattice mismatch , b ) reduced dimensionality , c ) hybridization of fe @xmath2-orbitals with the substrate , and d ) spin - orbit related effects for heavy metal substrates .",
    "novel experimental techniques have been developed , such as spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm),@xcite capable of resolving the magnetic structure of nanosized systems at the atomic level .",
    "this technique has recently shown that the ground state of a single monolayer ( ml ) of fe on w@xmath3 is a collinear afm state rather than a fm one.@xcite one way to partly rationalize the demise of ferromagnetism in this system could be the observation that the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy @xmath4 is strongly depressed upon adsorption.@xcite since the fm susceptibility is essentially proportional to @xmath4 , while the afm susceptibility is not , antiferromagnetism might happen to suffer less from interaction with the substrate , and prevail over ferromagnetism because of that .",
    "this hypothetical possibility fits the additional experimental observation that fe monolayers remain fm on w@xmath5 , where adsorption is weaker , this different tungsten face being better packed and less reactive than w@xmath3.@xcite single mls of fe on ir@xmath6 have also been shown to be afm and to form complex , collinear mosaic structures.@xcite    here we are concerned with deposited fe nanostructures rather than monolayers .",
    "the initial steps of fe deposition on the @xmath7 reconstructed ir@xmath0 surface of ref",
    ". showed that fe deposition initially forms metastable double chains , which appear to occupy the trough - like double minima of the quasi - hexagonal ir@xmath0 top layer height profile .",
    "while the presence of the @xmath7 periodicity suggests the permanence of reconstruction or at least some amount of reconstruction , it does not actually certify that the pristine quasi hexagonal reconstruction of the ir@xmath0 substrate remains unaltered upon fe adsorption .",
    "the existing data do not permit to resolve the detailed structure of the underlying ir substrate.@xcite the fe double chains might deposit without altering the initial reconstruction , or they may alter it to some extent .",
    "indeed , it is found that the @xmath7 ir(100 ) reconstruction becomes eventually lifted at high fe coverage and high temperature.@xcite    the scope of the present calculations is to analyze and possibly predict the magnetic state of fe double chains adsorbed on ir@xmath0 . as an added bonus",
    ", we wish to establish whether something can be learnt from the relationship between magnetism and structure , also in view of the ongoing sp - stm experiments on these systems at low - temperatures.@xcite    this is not the first theory work on fe double chains on ir(100 ) . in ref .",
    "the structure and energetics of this system was already investigated by first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "different adsorption sites were considered and structural relaxations were performed for both fm and non - magnetic ( nm ) configurations . the fm configuration was shown to be always preferred over the nm one , which is consistent with fe s strong hund s rule intra - atomic parameters .",
    "however , these studies did not examine other interesting possibilities such as afm or non - collinear orderings .",
    "furthermore the effects of soc were not considered , so that no specific easy magnetization axis and magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters were established .",
    "we will present here two sets of calculations .",
    "the first set will investigate collinear spin structures only and , for that purpose , we will use a realistic model of the substrate consisting of a seven ir layer slab .",
    "the ground state energy and optimal state of magnetization of free standing and ir(100 ) deposited fe double chains will be compared without soc , i.e. , within the scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "here only two possible magnetization states are considered , namely fm and afm ( same magnetization sign of two fe atoms across the double chain , alternating sign between first neighbors parallel to the chains ) .",
    "crucially , different structures will be considered for the underlying ir(100 ) substrate , and their relative energetics compared . in a second set of calculations",
    ", the soc will be included by switching to the more time - consuming fully relativistic approximation , and here different afm spin directions will be considered , so as to extract magnetic anisotropy energies ( maes ) . for mae calculations",
    "the same realistic seven ir layer slab will be used to model the surface .",
    "noncollinear spin structures with opposite chirality will also be considered , so as to extract the dm coupling energy . however , because of the larger supercells required along the chain direction to model spin spirals , this set of calculations is limited by computer time economy to smaller and simpler slabs .",
    "eventually , a fairly complete scenario of the structures , energies , and magnetization geometries will emerge , allowing a discussion , and a tentative prediction subject to our rather limited accuracy , of the relationship between them .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that fe double chains metastably deposited on fully reconstructed ir(100 ) may develop long - pitched helical spin structures whereas the same double chains on the partly reconstructed surface , a state of much lower energy , should exhibit a simple , collinear afm ground state .",
    "standard dft electronic structure calculations were carried out within a gga approximation with a pbe exchange - correlation functional ,  @xcite as implemented in the plane - wave pwscf code included in the quantum - espresso package .",
    "@xcite we employed ultrasoft pseudo - potentials generated according to the rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos scheme.@xcite the wavefunctions were expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 30 ry , whereas the charge density cutoff was 300 ry for slab calculations and 800 ry for free - standing wires . in all the structural optimization runs , hellmann - feynman forces were calculated with high accuracy ( at each step , the allowed error in the total energy was set to 10@xmath8 ry ) and a stringent convergence criterion was used for structural energy minimization ( all components of all forces required to be smaller than 10@xmath9 atomic units and the change in the total energy between two consecutive steps required to be less than 10@xmath10 atomic units ) .",
    "convergence with respect to k - points , smearing parameters , wavefunction and density cutoff was checked very carefully .",
    "furthermore , the total energies and forces of the optimized structures were recalculated within the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method ( same method used in ref .  ) , very recently implemented in the pwscf code , and found to be in good agreement with the ultrasoft pseudopotential calculations .",
    "free - standing single and double fe wires in the initial test calculations were modeled by chains parallel to the @xmath11-axis and periodically repeated along the @xmath12 and @xmath13 direction .",
    "the minimum distance between periodic images was 20 a.u .",
    "for single chains , the intra - chain spacing was allowed to vary so as to determine the equilibrium spacing . for double chains ,",
    "the intra - chain spacing was set at 2.758  , corresponding to the substrate - imposed intra - chain spacing of deposited chains which we will need to adopt in later calculations .",
    "the reconstructed ir@xmath0 surface has @xmath7 periodicity and a @xmath14 higher lateral density ( in its quasi - hexagonal top layer ) than a regular bulk @xmath0 plane with its square lattice .",
    "a @xmath7 supercell was used for the clean ir@xmath0 and for fm fe double chains on ir@xmath0 , whereas a @xmath15 supercell was required for the afm case . in the following ,",
    "the @xmath16-axis will be taken perpendicular to the surface , the @xmath11-axis parallel to the chains , and the @xmath17-axis in the plane and normal to the chains . in all scalar relativistic calculations , and in the so calculations of magnetic anisotropy ,",
    "the ir substrate was modelled as a seven layer slab periodically repeated across 13  wide vacuum regions .",
    "fe double chains were deposited on one face of the slab , while the other face was a perfect @xmath0 surface .",
    "both the reconstruction of the clean surface and the relaxation of fe / ir@xmath0 systems were treated by allowing the four topmost ir layers to relax , and starting from a six - atom / cell ir topmost layer .",
    "a few scalar - relativistic test calculations were repeated with a 9-layer , symmetric slab with fe double chains on both faces of the slab .",
    "the agreement between these calculations and those carried out with asymmetric 7-layer slabs was very good .",
    "a @xmath18 monkhorst - pack mesh  @xcite of special points was used for the integration over the brillouin zone for the @xmath7 cell and an equivalent mesh was used for the @xmath15 cell .",
    "the fermi function smearing approach of ref .   was used to deal with electron occupancy near the fermi level , with a smearing parameter of @xmath19 ry . as a test of our pseudopotential , we calculated the lattice parameter , @xmath20 , and the bulk modulus @xmath21 of bulk fcc ir . our results , @xmath22  and @xmath23 mbar ,",
    "compare very well with the experimental values , @xmath24  and @xmath25 mbar .",
    "we started off with ideal , free - standing fe single chains .",
    "similar to previous work ,  @xcite we found first of all that the lowest energy state of free standing fe chains is fm . in table",
    "[ tab_eqfes ] the calculated equilibrium fe - fe distance and the magnetization per fe atom of nm , fm and afm chains are compared with those given in the literature . the calculated total energy of free single chains in the fm and afm configuration as a function of fe - fe distance is shown in fig.[en_wires_fm_af ] . the epitaxial fe chains on ir@xmath0 are stretched lengthwise and the energy difference between afm and fm chains , @xmath26 , shrinks for stretched wires . at the theoretical intrachain fe - fe distance of wires deposited on ir@xmath0 , 2.758  , @xmath27 ev / fe atom .    for double chains , we restricted ourselves to the 2.758  intrachain fe - fe distance only .",
    "it was found that free standing fe double chains are also fm , although the energy difference per fe atom between fm and afm is smaller than for isolated chains .",
    "energies and magnetizations of fe atoms are shown in table  [ tab_fed ] .",
    "the magnetization of an atom is conventionally calculated by integrating the up - down spin density difference in a sphere centered on the atom , with radius equal to half the distance between the atom and its nearest neighbor .",
    "separately we considered the clean , reconstructed @xmath7 ir@xmath0 surface .",
    "the calculated surface energy @xmath28 and work function @xmath29 of the surface are @xmath30 ev and @xmath31 ev respectively , in excellent agreement with experiments  @xcite and with previous theoretical work .",
    "@xcite the calculated surface energy difference between the perfect @xmath32 and the reconstructed @xmath7 surface was @xmath33 ev / ( @xmath32 area ) , which also compares well with previous gga calculations .",
    "@xcite note that , had we used the lda approximation , the @xmath7 reconstructed phase would instead have been unstable ,  @xcite in contrast to experiments .    the structural parameters of the reconstructed ir@xmath0 surface are shown in table  [ tab_ir ] ( the notation of ref .",
    "is used ) .",
    "our results are in good agreement with experimental structure parameters as measured by leed ,  @xcite as well as with previous calculations .",
    "@xcite    all basic ingredients ready , we proceeded to investigate the properties and energetics of fe double chains deposited on the ir substrate .",
    "there are three different energy scales at play in this system .",
    "the first is the structural scale , involving energy differences of the order of 100 mev / fe atom .",
    "the second is the magnetic intersite exchange scale , involving differences of the order of 10 mev / fe atom .",
    "the third is the spin orientational scale ( spin orbit related ) , involving differences of the order of 1 mev / fe atom .",
    "we stress that the size of inter - site exchange interactions between magnetic fe atoms is two orders of magnitude smaller than the intra - atomic `` magnetic '' exchange energy scale , of order of 1 ev / fe atom , due to the very strong hund s rule intra - atomic interactions .",
    "we proceeded to examine structures first .",
    "several configurations of fe double wires on ir@xmath0 were considered , corresponding to different adsorption sites for the fe atoms ( see fig.[config ] ) . adopting the notation of ref .",
    "we considered c@xmath34 , c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 configurations .",
    "configurations c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 correspond to fe chains adsorbed on the troughs of @xmath7 ir@xmath0 , whereas c@xmath35 corresponds to fe chains sitting on the hills of @xmath7 ir@xmath0 .",
    "the zig - zag shaped configuration denoted as c@xmath37 in ref .",
    "was not considered , for stm images fail to suggest zig - zag shaped chains .",
    "@xcite    we found , interestingly , that c@xmath34 , c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 configurations were all metastable .",
    "this is because the fe chains should lift the reconstruction of ir@xmath0 , rather than adsorb on the @xmath7 fully reconstructed structure .",
    "in fact the calculated adsorbtion energy of double chains on perfect , unreconstructed @xmath32 ir(100 ) , where the top layer is a square lattice , is 0.57 ev / fe atom larger than on @xmath7 ir(100 ) , where the top layer is a distorted triangular lattice .",
    "this energy difference was calculated in a grand - canonical definition , i.e. by subtracting the sum of the energy of the fully deconstructed structure and the energy of a bulk ir atom to the energy of the reconstructed structure .",
    "however , the ir surface deconstruction from @xmath7 to @xmath32 implies the removal of  20 % of the first layer ir atoms , which may not readily take place when the double chains are experimentally deposited at low temperature and low coverage .",
    "@xcite at high t and/or high fe coverages , full experimental deconstruction of ir(100 ) takes place , with expulsion of the excess ir atoms from the first layer and formation of ir chains on top of the surface .",
    "similar superstructures consisting of ir rows on ir@xmath0 have recently been seen also in case of adsorption of h atoms on this surface , at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "@xcite however , at low t and coverage , the @xmath7 structure may be kinetically frozen , given the massive atomic migration and rearrangement required to produce the @xmath32 .",
    "a second possibility is a partial deconstruction of the surface , taking place without removal of any ir atoms .",
    "a simple displacement of ir atoms from beneath the fe double chains ( where the ir layer structure may be locally altered ) to besides the chains should be much less kinetically hindered than a full deconstruction . to investigate this possibility , we started from c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 structures and looked for concerted displacements of fe and ir atoms that would spontaneously lower the energy .",
    "the structures were perturbed by moving the fe atoms midway between the c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 adsorption sites : then they were relaxed using a standard broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) quasi - newton method .",
    "it became apparent in this way that both c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 structures are unstable against a lateral shifting motion of ir atoms underneath the fe chains .",
    "to lower the energy , the ir atoms shifted sideways so as to restore a square ideal @xmath0 geometry underneath the double chains , and accumulating besides them .",
    "this ir rearrangement yielded a partially deconstructed @xmath7 structure wherein the fe atoms sit on the hollow sites of a quasi - square , locally deconstructed ir@xmath0 surface ( see fig.[config ] , where the structure is denoted as dec ) , slightly compressed along the direction perpendicular to the fe chains ( the ir - ir distance along this direction is 2.67  , to be compared with the equilibrium distance of 2.76  ) .",
    "the atomic coordinates of this structure in the fm phase are listed in table  [ tab_dec ] .",
    "this structure is lowest in energy among the @xmath7 fe / ir systems explored , with a large energy gain of about 0.46 ev per fe atom with respect to c@xmath36 , which is the lowest energy reconstructed structure . since stm images do not yield information on the position of ir atoms beneath or besides the fe chains , this partially deconstructed @xmath7 fe / ir ( dec ) structure seems as compatible as reconstructed ( rec ) c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 structures with available data , and thus deserves to be investigated on similar grounds .",
    "we remark finally that _ both _ the rec and dec surface geometries are strictly speaking metastable .",
    "we calculate in fact the total energy of double chains ( coverage 0.4 ml ) on a _ completely deconstructed _",
    "ir@xmath0 surface to be still 0.11 ev /fe atom lower than the energy of the dec structure , and 0.57 ev lower than that of the rec c@xmath36 structure .",
    "the larger extent of the latter difference indicates however that most of the energy gain is obtained as soon as the ir rearrangemnent is actuated locally beneath the fe double chain , suggesting that structures like dec should be taken in serious consideration as structural candidates .",
    "the structural parameters for non - magnetic , fm and afm wires on ir@xmath0 are shown in table  [ tab_feir ] .",
    "we note that , contrary to ref .  , and surprisingly given the similarity of approaches , the c@xmath35 structure is highest in energy amongst all rec structures , rather than the lowest .",
    "we repeatedly checked all possible sources of error in our calculation but found none .",
    "in agreement with ref .  , we found for all structures that nonmagnetic configurations are always disfavored over the magnetic ones , reflecting fe s strong hund s rule coupling .",
    "we then considered in parallel the rec and dec structures . in our calculations",
    "the lowest energy fm structure among the rec ones is c@xmath34 , whereas in ref .",
    "it was reported to be c@xmath35 , which is least favored in our calculations . in the afm case , on the other hand",
    ", c@xmath36 is lower in energy than either c@xmath34 and c@xmath35 , although the structural energy difference between c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 is quite small , only 0.02 ev .",
    "c@xmath35 is always the highest energy structure , which agrees with the experimental evidence that double chains appear to sit in the troughs of the @xmath7 ir@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , the structural interchain distances of the c@xmath34 , c@xmath36 and dec structures are 2.42 , 4.17 and 2.52  respectively , all different from the apparent distances in the stm pictures , 3.3 @xmath38 0.2  . as pointed out in ref .  , the error of this `` experimental '' value may well be much larger than 0.2  because apparent maxima in stm images may strongly deviate from actual centers of the fe atoms . in conclusion , the stm pictures do not really discriminate between various structures .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments of fe atoms are of the order of 3.1 + /-",
    "0.1 @xmath39 in both fm and afm configurations .",
    "the ir atoms moments neighbouring the magnetic fe chains generally become magnetically polarized , with moments of order 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath39 in the fm case ; in the afm case , on the other hand , some of the moments of nearby ir atoms vanish by symmetry ( in the dec structure , they _ all _ vanish by symmetry ) .",
    "we also considered afm structures wherein fe atoms transverse to the double chain have opposite magnetization sign ( and the coupling between first neighbors parallel to the chain direction is still afm ) .",
    "the energy of this tranverse afm configuration is higher than the longitudinal afm one considered above by @xmath40 ev per atom depending on the structure , with the exception of c@xmath36 , where the two configurations are practically degenerate .",
    "this is not unexpected , for the distance between chains is large in c@xmath36 so they weakly interact with each other .",
    "since these transverse afm structures are in general energetically higher than the longitudinal afm ones , we will not investigate them further .",
    "the demise of fm in favor of afm in ir - deposited chains is due to fe - ir hybridization , since free - standing double chains are always fm .",
    "following a reasoning parallel to that of blgel et al.@xcite this could tentatively be rationalized in terms of changes in the respective fm and afm susceptibilities .",
    "the fm susceptibility should be approximately proportional to the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level evaluated in the nm state and projected ( pdos ) on the fe atoms , @xmath41 .",
    "we calculated the nm dos for all the relevant structures and compared their projected value onto fe atoms with the nm dos of free - standing , coupled chains ( see figs .",
    "[ dosa_c1]-  [ dosa_dec ] , where the nm pdos of the c@xmath34 and the dec structures are shown together with the fm and afm ones ; the pdos of the c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 structures show a qualitatively similar behavior ) . confirming expectations , we note a clear decrease of pdos upon deposition on the ir@xmath0 surface .",
    "one might now be tempted to surmise that since @xmath41 is reduced upon deposition on ir@xmath0 due to hybridization with ir , ferromagnetism might be disfavored relative to afm due to a selective decrease of the fm susceptibility relative to the afm one .",
    "a pdos decrease could reduce the violation of stoner s fm criterion @xmath42 ( where u is an exchange energy parameter ) , while the afm susceptibility need not do exactly the same , as there is no straight a priori proportionality between pdos and afm susceptibility . to investigate that aspect ,",
    "we conducted constrained magnetization calculations allowing a numerical evaluation of the zero - field fm and afm susceptibilities . to reduce computational times , we did that for a `` toy '' dec structure consisting of fe atoms and nearest neighbor ir atoms only ( in total 2 + 3 atoms in the fm cell and 4 + 6 atoms in the afm cell ) .",
    "for this structure the afm structure is lower in energy than the fm one by about @xmath43 mev per fe atom .",
    "the constraint on the fe local magnetic moments ( calculated by integrating the magnetization density in a sphere centered on the fe atoms , as explained at the beginning of section iii ) was imposed by adding a penalty functional to the total energy . as fig .",
    "[ suscept ] shows , for small magnetizations there is a quadratic energy decrease with magnetization , which measures separately the fm and afm susceptibilities .",
    "the fm and afm energies remain however extremely close at all small magnetizations , and do not indicate appreciable differences between fm and afm susceptibilities .",
    "so while there is an ir - induced fm susceptibility decrease connected with the ir - induced decrease of @xmath41 , that does not seem to explain the switch from fm to afm .",
    "the afm energy gain is realized at large magnetization magnitudes , not revealed at the perturbative level .",
    "the main notable ir - related difference between fm and afm states is the finite magnetic polarization required for the nearby ir atoms in the fm case , contrasted by the symmetry - induced zero magnetic polarization for some ( rec structures ) or all ( dec structure ) of the nearby ir atoms in the afm case . due to an interplay between magnetism and structure , the fe magnetic orbitals",
    "delocalize over the ir substrate atoms in the fm case , but less , or not at all ( depending on the structure ) , in the afm case . as a result",
    "the ir - related reduction of magnetic energy gain is less important in the afm case than in the fm case .",
    "if this indeed is the mechanism that causes the switch from fm to afm , then it could hold for other magnetic elements as well . to explore this hypothesis , we studied the magnetic properties of mn , co , ni double chains on @xmath7 ir@xmath0 ( restricting to c@xmath34 and dec configurations ) .",
    "the starting unsupported mn chains were found to be afm , whereas co and ni chains were fm .",
    "energy differences between fm and afm mn , co and ni double chains ( free - standing and deposited on ir@xmath0 ) are shown in table  [ tab_coni ] , with fe also shown by comparison .",
    "similar to the fe chains , the ir surface was unstable against deconstruction when mn , co or ni chains are adsorbed on the surface . in the end , it turned out that ir - deposited co and ni double chains were still fm , unlike fe .",
    "however , the energy difference between fm and afm structures was substantially reduced when co and ni chains were adsorbed on ir@xmath0 for all geometries ( except for co chains in c@xmath34 geometry , where it increased by 0.03 ev ) .",
    "double mn chains remained afm when deposited on ir@xmath0 , but the energy gap between the afm and fm configurations again increased . on the whole , these results seem to confirm our starting hypothesis .",
    "we may tentatively conclude therefore that the selective spillout of magnetization to ir atoms near the fe chains present in the fm state but reduced or absent in the afm state should play an important role in shifting the energetic balance from fm towards afm , although other , subtler and more specific effects should be invoked in order to explain the dependence of the relative stability of fm and afm configurations upon the transition metal element and the adsorption structure . on this aspect",
    "there is room for further work addressing the physical mechanism in more detail , maybe resorting to some simplified and more transparent schemes such as tight - binding .",
    "magnetic anisotropy energies were calculated for both unsupported and deposited fe double chains , where the rec ( c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 ) and the dec configurations have been considered . in",
    "free afm fe double chains , the easy axis was found to lie along @xmath16 , perpendicular to the plane containing the chains for chain - chain distances corresponding to the c@xmath34 and dec structures ( see table  [ tab_mae ] ) . for large chain - chain distances ,",
    "the easy axis switched to @xmath11 , along the chains , in agreement with the single chain limit .",
    "@xcite    in ir - deposited afm fe double chains the easy magnetization axis of both c@xmath34 and c@xmath36 rec structures was @xmath17 , parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the chains . in the dec structure ,",
    "@xmath17 was instead the hard axis , whereas the easy axis was @xmath11 , parallel to the chains ( see table  [ tab_mae ] ) .",
    "these magnetic anisotropy results hold for fm configurations as well , as could be expected from phenomenological on - site anisotropy parameters . from the predicted opposite magnetic anisotropies of rec and dec structures , it follows that the detection of the easy magnetization axis of the double chains on ir@xmath0 by sp - stm techniques could yield indirect but important information on the unknown local structure of the ir@xmath0 surface .    in principle , we note , magnetostatic effects due to magnetic dipolar interactions could also give rise to magnetic anisotropy effects .",
    "however , for our two - chain afm system these dipole - dipole energies can be estimated to be less than 0.1 mev , much smaller than magnetocrystalline energies due to soc , and can be neglected .",
    "the second important effect of spin orbit interaction on magnetism is the onset of a dzyaloshinskii - moriya inter - site interaction term of the form@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dzyaloshinskii vector .",
    "the dm interaction is chiral and is due to the concerted effect of spin - orbit coupling and a lack of structural inversion symmetry at the surface .",
    "the direction of @xmath45 is determined solely by structural symmetry.@xcite more specifically , the intrachain inter - site @xmath45 must be orthogonal to a mirror plane containing sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and parallel to a mirror plane bisecting @xmath48 . for the fe double chains on ir(100 ) , where a pair of ( magnetically parallel ) fe atoms is the effective magnetic site , the vector @xmath45 lies on the surface plane and normal to the double chain , i.e. parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath17 axis .",
    "the sign of @xmath45 , a vector which breaks the left - right structural symmetry , will switch by switching the sign of magnetization , in accordance with time reversal symmetry .",
    "it is otherwise fully determined microscopically by the asymmetry of the selfconsistent potential gradient in the surface region .",
    "we calculated the magnitude and sign of @xmath49 , assumed to be restricted to first neighbors , by direct energy difference between two noncollinear magnetic structures of the deposited double chain , each composed of four fe pairs , or eight fe atom / cell .",
    "the magnetization was constrained to be orthogonal between one fe pair to the next down the double chain . in the first magnetic structure ,",
    "the magnetization direction was taken to rotate in the sense y , z , -y , -z ; in the second , it counter - rotated in the sense y , -z , -y , z. these two magnetic spirals have identical structural , exchange and anisotropy energies , so that their energy difference identifies precisely the dm term alone .",
    "since heavy computational cost restricted us to relatively small systems , we considered two successive sizes , comprising respectively 12 and 36 ir atoms , corresponding to fe nearest neighbor atoms and fe nearest and next nearest neighbor atoms , respectively .",
    "this allowed an appreciation of the kind of finite size error involved , as well as some level of extrapolation towards ideally larger sizes .",
    "atomic relaxations of the small systems were not taken into account , i.e. atoms were frozen at the positions obtained by relaxing the corresponding 7-layer slabs . moreover , only two experimentally relevant structures were considered : the c@xmath34 ( rec ) structure and dec structure .",
    "( as discussed above , the distance betweeen chains in c@xmath36 is very large and somewhat less likely than c@xmath34 ) .",
    "it turns out that dm favors right - handed cycloidal spin spirals for both structures .",
    "as far as the rec structure is concerned , the magnitude @xmath50 of the dzyaloshinskii vector slightly increases for the larger size systems , from 2 to 3 mev , whereas anisotropy energies decrease somewhat from 3 - 4 mev to 1 - 2 mev .",
    "we conclude that for the rec deposited fe double chain , maes are of the order of 1 mev ( table  [ tab_mae ] ) , whereas @xmath50 is about 3 mev . in the dec structure ,",
    "both @xmath50 and maes are large but do get significantly smaller in the larger size system : @xmath50 drops from 12 to 7 mev and @xmath51 from 8 to 2 mev . extrapolating , we conclude that in the dec deposited double chain the anisotropy energy @xmath52 could be about 1 mev , @xmath50 of order 5 mev .",
    "if anisotropy were ideally zero but at the same time the dm term were finite , no matter how small , the collinear afm magnetic structure would spontaneously transform to a rotating magnetic structure , whose pitch would diverge as @xmath50 tends to zero.@xcite on the other hand , once anisotropy is large enough , the collinear afm state will prevail over noncollinear magnetism .",
    "the relatively large anisotropies and dm values reported in the previous sections indicate that the competition between afm and helical spin structures needs to be considered in quantitative detail , as was recently done for other systems by blgel and collaborators.@xcite    in the following we will describe our system by a micromagnetic continuous model:@xcite for fm systems , this approximation is justified if the magnetic moment variations are small on a length scale where exchange and dm interactions are significant . for our afm double chains , given two intrachain nearest neighbor sites @xmath53 and @xmath54 with magnetization @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",

    "these three quantities depend on the crystal structure and can be expressed in terms of the exchange constants @xmath63 , @xmath45 vectors and anisotropy energy tensor @xmath64 of the discrete model .",
    "we may assume that only nearest neighbor exchange and dm interactions are important : then @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the fe - fe intrachain distance and @xmath69 and @xmath49 are the nearest neighbor exchange and dm parameters .",
    "the nearest neighbor @xmath69 is straightforwardly evaluated from the energy difference between fm and afm phases.@xcite in the following we will separately address two cases , namely :    \\a ) @xmath70 parallel to the hard axis .",

    "this problem is considered in detail in the literature@xcite and excellently summarized in the thesis of m. heide.@xcite for spin structures lying in the @xmath71 plane , formula ( [ micro_func ] ) simplifies to @xmath75 dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the angle between the local magnetization and the easy axis , @xmath11 , and @xmath77 . a non - collinear",
    ", helical state will appear if the dm - related energy gain is higher than twice the formation energy of an optimal domain wall in the @xmath71 plane.@xcite this is equivalent to : @xmath78 inserting the numerical values @xmath69 = 29 mev and @xmath52 = 1.7 mev , we obtain the inequality @xmath79 mev , estimated for the occurrence of a helical state in the dec structure . from our calculations , we estimate @xmath50 around 5 mev , smaller than the critical value , although generally of the same order of magnitude . therefore , we tentatively conclude that the afm collinear state is most likely in the dec structure . in view of our poor accuracy ,",
    "however , we can not totally exclude a helical state with a very long pitch , consisting of wide antiferromagnetic domains separated by well separated domain walls .",
    "\\b ) if @xmath50 is paralled to the easy axis , then three - dimensional non - collinear structures are also possible , besides collinear and two - dimensional non - collinear ones .",
    "a thorough description of this case can be found in ref .  .",
    "since the condition @xmath62 holds , formula ( [ micro_func ] ) can be written as @xmath80 dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the easy , intermediate and hard components of the anisotropy energy tensor respectively ( see anisotropy energies for the c@xmath84 rec structure in table  [ tab_mae ] ) .",
    "expanding the integrand of ( [ micro_func_cart ] ) around the afm solution , @xmath85 , one gets the following euler - lagrange equations : @xmath86 considering again only nearest neighbor @xmath69 and @xmath49 , these equations have a periodic solution , @xmath87 if and only if  @xcite @xmath88 moreover , when the above inequality is fulfilled , the non - collinear state is always lower in energy than the afm collinear solution .",
    "therefore , when @xmath89 , a second - order phase transition to a 3-dimensional state takes place .",
    "the system undergoes a second - order transition to a 2-dimensional helical state in the @xmath71 plane at slightly higher values of @xmath50 , but this critical point can not be determined analytically .  @xcite we should emphasize that , in our case , the range of @xmath50 values where the 3-dimensional state is stable ( which depends on the magnitude of the components of the magnetic anisotropy tensor , see ref .  )",
    "is very narrow . inserting the numerical values @xmath69 = 0.5 mev and @xmath90 = 0.7 mev corresponding to c@xmath84 in formula ( [ dhard ] )",
    ", we obtain that the afm will be destabilized if @xmath91 mev .",
    "since our rec surface calculations suggest @xmath50 values around 3 mev , which is larger than this threshold , we conclude that in a rec structure like c@xmath34 , where the double chains do not deconstruct the underlying ir(100 ) surface , the magnetic ground state should be non - collinear , and in particular a @xmath71 helical state is the most likely outcome . in conclusion , a sketch of the predicted magnetic ground state for the dec and rec ( c@xmath34 ) structures is shown in fig .  [ magn_config ] .",
    "we studied by _ ab initio _ electronic structure and total energy calculations fe double chains on @xmath7 ir@xmath0 .",
    "several different structures with the experimentally observed @xmath7 periodicity were considered , particularly one , c@xmath34 rec , where the underlying ir surface remains quasi - hexagonally reconstructed , and another , dec , where it is partially deconstructed , with a large decrease of total energy . by addressing magnetism first without spin orbit effects , we find that in all structures considered the deposited fe double chains do not remain fm as in vacuum , but generally adopt an afm ground state . the demise of ferromagnetism is attributed to fe - ir hybridization .",
    "the hybridization of fe with the ir substrate brings about first of all a drop of the fe - projected density of electronic states near @xmath92 in the non - magnetic state , which reduces the fm susceptibility .",
    "however , we find that the afm susceptibility is also reduced by the same amount upon adsorption . at large magnetization , afm appears eventually to be favored by a magnetization node intervening by symmetry in the bridging ir atoms , a node which is absent in the fm case . by including spin orbit in the calculations ,",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energies of relevant rec and dec structures have been determined .",
    "the easy axis is found to lie in the surface plane and perpendicular to the fe double chain in the rec structure , and parallel to the chains in the dec structure . finally , we calculated the dzyaloshinskii - moriya spin - spin interaction energy , and found it to be generally of a competitive magnitude when compared to anisotropy . the different possibilities arising for the resulting ground state magnetization pattern are examined . within the substantial uncertainties connected with our estimated computational and finite size errors ,",
    "we conclude that a collinear afm state with in - plane magnetization vector is likely to prevail in the dec structure , whereas a long period rotating magnetization in an orthogonal plane could instead prevail in the rec structure .",
