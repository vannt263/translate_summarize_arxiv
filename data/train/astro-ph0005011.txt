    "since the discovery of the high - redshift ly@xmath2  forest over 25 years ago , these abundant absorption features in the spectra of qsos have been used as evolutionary probes of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , galactic halos , large - scale structure , and chemical evolution .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst / fos ) key project on qso absorption systems found that ly@xmath2  absorbers persist to low redshift in surprisingly large numbers ( bahcall et al .",
    "1991 ; morris et al .  1991",
    "; jannuzi et al . 1998 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper , we assume that the ly@xmath2  ( and ly@xmath1 ) lines are intergalactic .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss the possibility that some c  iv absorption systems could be intrinsic to the agn or ejected at relativistic velocities .",
    "the colorado group has used hst to conduct a major survey of ly@xmath2  absorbers at low redshift ( @xmath14 ) along 15 agn sightlines , using the moderate - resolution ( 19 km  s@xmath0 ) ghrs spectrograph ( stocke et al .  1995 ; shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ; penton et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "additional moderate - resolution hst / stis data along 13 sightlines were taken during hst cycle 7 .",
    "these observations measured ly@xmath2  absorbers down to equivalent widths of 1020 mand determined distributions of the low-@xmath3 ly@xmath2  absorbers in h  i column density for @xmath15 and in line width for @xmath16 km  s@xmath0  ( penton et al .",
    "the distribution function , @xmath17 , together with photoionization corrections suggest ( shull et al .",
    "1999a ) that the low-@xmath3 ly@xmath2  forest may contain a significant fraction of the baryons predicted by nucleosynthesis models of d / h ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "however , a precise baryon census in the low-@xmath3 igm requires measurements of the true doppler parameter , @xmath5 , to obtain accurate column densities in saturated ly@xmath2  lines with log  n@xmath18 .",
    "measurements of ly@xmath1  or higher lyman lines are needed to constrain the degree of saturation through a curve - of - growth ( cog ) analysis .",
    "indeed , recent orfeus studies ( hurwitz et al .",
    "1998 ) of ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2   ratios in two absorbers toward 3c  373 suggest that @xmath5 is less than the line width determined from ly@xmath2  profile fitting .    with the goal of characterizing the distribution of @xmath5-values and measuring accurate h  i columns , we conducted a fuse mini - survey of ly@xmath1  absorbers toward 7 agn with well - known ly@xmath2  lines .",
    "the fuse mission and its capabilities are described by moos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in ",
    "2 we describe our fuse ly@xmath1  observations .",
    "we also compare simple cog ( ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2 ) estimates of @xmath5 with single - component fits to ( hst ) ly@xmath2  lines to understand the kinematic structure of the low-@xmath3 absorbers . in ",
    "3 we present our conclusions and give directions for future work on the igm baryon content , line kinematics , and temperature .",
    "our observations were obtained with the fuse satellite from 1999 september to november during the commissioning phase . because the initial fuse observations were taken with relatively long durations ( 1649 ksec ) we were able to obtain reasonable signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n @xmath19 1520 ) in the lif channels .",
    "the sic channels had lower s / n and were not available for all targets .",
    "the spectral resolution was generally 2025 km  s@xmath0 , based on an analysis of narrow interstellar lines of h@xmath20 , ar  i , and fe  ii in our h@xmath20 mini - survey ( shull et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our fuse ly@xmath1  mini - survey consisted of 7 agn chosen from targets for which the colorado group had previously obtained hst spectra with ghrs / g160 m or stis / e140 m .",
    "our three ghrs targets and full line lists are : h1821 + 643 ( savage , sembach , & lu 1995 ; tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ; penton et al .",
    "2000a ) , eso  141-g55 ( sembach , savage , & hurwitz 1999 ; penton et al .",
    "2000a ) , and pks  2155 - 304 ( shull et al .",
    "1998 ; penton et al .",
    "data on our four stis targets ( mrk  876 , pg  0804 + 761 , vii  zw  118 , and ton  s180 ) will be published separately .    from these 7 targets , we chose 12 strong ly@xmath2  absorbers with rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath21 mand relatively simple line profiles .",
    "each of the ly@xmath2  lines had a detectable ly@xmath1  counterpart , and in several cases we detected higher lyman series lines .",
    "figure 1 shows three examples : the 5512 km  s@xmath0  ly@xmath1  absorber toward ton  s180 ; the @xmath22 ly@xmath23  absorber toward h1821 + 643 ; and the 10,463 km  s@xmath0  ly@xmath1  absorber toward eso  141-g55 .",
    "although pks  2155 - 304 contains several strong ly@xmath2  lines near @xmath24 km  s@xmath0 , their line blending is sufficiently complex that we did not include them in the survey .",
    "for the 12 chosen lines , we measured equivalent widths by gaussian profile fitting , using standard fuse pipeline software . assuming a single - component curve of growth , we used the concordance of the ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2  ratios ( or higher lyman lines ) to derive @xmath5 and n@xmath6 .",
    "after minimizing the @xmath25 of our fits to @xmath26 and @xmath5 , we constructed @xmath27 contours to define confidence regions for these inferred quantities .",
    "the error bars on @xmath26 and @xmath5 represent single - parameter 68% confidence intervals for each component and assume that the true line shape is well represented by a single - component , doppler - broadened line .    if ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath1  are unsaturated , their equivalent widths are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where n@xmath30 .",
    "thus , weak absorbers should have a ratio ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2  = 0.135 , and saturation gradually increases this ratio towards 1 .",
    "our typical fuse ly@xmath1  detection limit of 40 m  ( @xmath31 ) corresponds to log  n@xmath32 .",
    "our success in detecting ly@xmath1  for all ly@xmath2  lines with @xmath21 m  is consistent with the relative line strengths .",
    "table 1 lists the 12 lines in our survey , together with ly@xmath2   velocities ( @xmath33 ) and line widths ( @xmath34 ) derived from instrumentally corrected gaussian fits to the ghrs or stis ly@xmath2   profiles . here , @xmath35 , and @xmath5 and n@xmath6",

    "these models predict temperatures and doppler parameters , conveniently approximated by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "the doppler parameters inferred from ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2  are considerably less than widths derived from ly@xmath2  profile - fitting .",
    "the statistical average , @xmath11 , suggests that the ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath1  line profiles are more complex than single - component , doppler - broadened gaussians .",
    "the widths of individual components must be less than the cog - inferred @xmath5-values , a general principle exemplified by the special case where @xmath46 identical , well - separated gaussians behave as a single one with a dispersion equal to @xmath47 . for each ensemble of components ,",
    "the total column density derived from ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath1  might be larger than the true value , but not by a large factor ( jenkins 1986 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath2  absorbers could be broadened by cosmological expansion , @xmath48 , across spatially extended h  i absorbers , as seen in numerical simulations ( weinberg , katz , & hernquist 1998 ) .",
    "the profiles could also be blends of velocity components arising from clumps of gas falling into dark - matter potential wells .",
    "if these clumps are sufficiently massive to be gravitationally bound , the velocity components may represent small - scale power at @xmath49 km  s@xmath0  in the cosmological spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "we have seen spectral evidence for such velocity components in the low-@xmath3 ly@xmath2  absorbers studied by hst / ghrs and stis at 19 km  s@xmath0  resolution and in their two - point correlation function , @xmath50 ( penton et al .",
    "2000b , c ) .",
    "we have also verified , through optical and 21-cm imaging , that some ly@xmath2  absorbers arise within small groups ( van gorkom et al.1996 ; shull et al .",
    "1998 ) .    with better statistics on the ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath1  line widths and doppler parameters",
    ", we should be able to constrain the kinematics of the absorber profiles .",
    "a critical issue is whether cosmological expansion or velocity components are the dominant contributor to line broadening .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the low-@xmath3 ly@xmath2  forest ( dav et al .",
    "1999 ) suggest that both effects are important .",
    "first and foremost , fuse has identified the low - redshift ly@xmath1  forest . lines between 1216",
    "  and ( 1216  )@xmath51 ) with no clear identification are often labeled as ly@xmath2 .",
    "the fuse detection of their ly@xmath1  counterparts makes these identifications conclusive .",
    "we have used the cog concordance of ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2 equivalent widths , and occasionally higher lyman lines , to derive reliable values of @xmath5 and n@xmath6 for the stronger , saturated lines ( @xmath21 m ) .",
    "our major findings are : ( 1 ) the doppler parameters from single - component cog fits to ly@xmath1/ly@xmath2  equivalent widths are considerably less than those derived from line profile fitting , with @xmath11 ; ( 2 ) we find @xmath8 km  s@xmath0   ( median 28 km  s@xmath0 ) , similar to values at redshifts @xmath37 2.02.5 ; ( 3 ) although these @xmath5-values correspond to @xmath52  k , the low-@xmath3 absorbers may contain non - thermal motions or line broadening from cosmological expansion and infall .    over its lifetime , fuse will observe many agn sightlines for the o  vi , d / h , and agn projects .",
    "this will produce a large survey of ly@xmath1 absorbers at @xmath53 that we can use to characterize the distributions in @xmath5 and n@xmath6 in the low - redshift ly@xmath1  forest .",
    "the distribution function , @xmath54 , can be used to derive the igm temperature distribution and infer its equation of state ( schaye et al .",
    "1999 ; ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2000 ) . with high - s /",
    "n data and a flux - limited sample , we can search for the hot baryons predicted by cosmological simulations ( cen & ostriker 1999a ) .",
    "these absorbers should appear in the high-@xmath5 tail of the distribution as broad , shallow absorbers .    because ly@xmath2  lines with @xmath55 m   ( log n@xmath56 ) appear to be saturated ( penton et al .",
    "2000b ) , hst alone can not provide accurate column densities for the strong ly@xmath2  absorbers that probably dominate the baryon content and opacity of the low-@xmath3 igm . for lines in which @xmath5 is well determined",
    ", log  @xmath26 typically increases by 0.3 dex , and up to 1 dex , compared to ly@xmath2  profile fitting .",
    "this increase , which is greatest in the most saturated ly@xmath2  lines , means that an even larger fraction of baryons may be found in the low-@xmath3 ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "a full ly@xmath1  survey will also provide a sample of high-@xmath26 absorbers which can be used to estimate the level of metallicity in the low-@xmath3 igm ( shull et al .",
    "1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999b ) . as an illustration",
