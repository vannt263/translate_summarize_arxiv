    "the next challenge for extreme value statistics is modeling and estimation of the structure of clusters of extreme values .",
    "as one concrete example , the europe 2003 heat wave may have killed around 60,000 persons .",
    "there has been a substantial discussion of whether it could be attributed to global warming .",
    "the nature paper [ @xcite ] uses extreme value methods with average summer temperature as a proxy for a heat wave to try to answer this question .",
    "however , the health effects are in reality linked to clusters of extremely high temperatures over much shorter time periods , and the fluctuations of temperature during this period determine risks .",
    "similarly , river flooding may be caused by not just one extreme rainfall event , but also by the ground already being saturated with water due to high precipitation during the preceding 510 days .",
    "this was , for example , the case for the large flood which occurred in northern sweden on july 26 , 2000 .",
    "thus , again , an entire sequence of large values are at the center of interest .",
    "this paper develops an empirical limit theory for clusters of extremes in stationary sequences .",
    "it provides a unified basis for asymptotic analysis of statistical methods which aim at answering questions such as the ones above .",
    "results include limit theorems for tail array sums , in particular , for multivariate tail empirical processes , and for joint survival functions of the values and order statistics in a cluster .",
    "more special examples , such as upcrossings , compound insurance claims , kernel density and bootstrap estimators , are also studied .",
    "estimation of the extremal index ( roughly , the inverse of the expected clusters length ) has received substantial attention in the extreme value statistics literature .",
    "the results of this paper can be used to prove asymptotic normality for a general type of estimator based on blocks of exceedances ; see @xcite .",
    "there are also a few papers [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] on markov chain modeling of clusters of extreme values .",
    "however , a major part of the work to develop useful statistical methods for the structure of clusters of extremes still remains to be done .",
    "our goal is that this paper will be useful for the analysis of existing methods , and that it will spur development of new methods .",
    "more specifically , we consider triangular arrays of row - wise stationary sequences of random variables .",
    "the variables are assumed to take their values in some set @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the standard examples .",
    "clusters of extremes are defined through a `` blocks '' method .",
    "the variables in each row of the array are divided up into blocks , and a cluster of extremes starts with the first `` extreme '' value in a block , if there is such a value , and ends with the last one .",
    "such a cluster is termed the `` core '' of the block . a function which maps a block into a real number",
    "is called a `` cluster functional '' if it only depends on the core of the block and if it equals 0 for blocks without extremes .",
    "in contrast to standard uniform central limit theorems , cores ( i.e. , clusters of extremes ) consist of a random number of variables , and , hence , cluster functionals have to be defined on a space of vectors of arbitrary lengths .",
    "the aim is to prove uniform central limit theorems for interesting classes of cluster functionals .",
    "we throughout use @xmath9-mixing ( or , with another name , absolute regularity ) as the basic dependence restriction .",
    "it is very widely applicable and makes it possible to transfer calculations from dependent blocks to easier calculations with independent blocks .",
    "finite - dimensional convergence of the cluster functionals in addition requires lindeberg conditions and convergence of covariances .",
    "we use suitable formulations of `` bracketing entropy '' to give conditions for asymptotic tightness , and bounds on covering numbers with respect to a random semi - metric to prove asymptotic equicontinuity .",
    "the latter , in particular , makes it possible to use the vapnik ",
    "ervonenkis theory to prove asymptotic equicontinuity . as usual ,",
    "uniform central limit theorems follow from finite - dimensional convergence together with asymptotic tightness , or together with asymptotic equicontinuity .    in the important context of estimation for panel count data , two articles by wellner and zhang ( @xcite , @xcite ) use uniform central limit theory for vectors of random lengths .",
    "these articles are aimed at the specific application and not at general theory .",
    "hence , they use special properties ( such as monotonicity ) of the classes of functions , do not consider triangular arrays , assume that the vectors are independent , and , in the second paper , also assume that the lengths of the vectors are uniformly bounded .",
    "however , the basic tools to prove tightness , that is , random covering numbers for the general case , and bracketing entropy for the uniformly bounded case are the same as in the present paper . we have not found any other references on uniform central limit theory for random vectors with random lengths .    one application of the theory of this paper is to multivariate tail empirical processes for stationary time series .",
    "let @xmath13 be a time series with marginal survival function @xmath14 .",
    "the univariate tail empirical process is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 the multivariate tail empirical process is defined analogously ; see examples [ tailedfexam ] and [ tailedfexam2 ] below . in the definition @xmath17",
    "is an increasing sequence of thresholds such that @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a sequence of positive normalizing constants such that the conditional distribution of @xmath20 given that @xmath21 converges weakly to some nondegenerate limit .",
    "[ in particular , the distribution function ( df ) of @xmath22 then belongs to the domain of attraction of some extreme value distribution . ]",
    "rootzn ( @xcite , @xcite ) proved weak convergence of @xmath23 to a gaussian process ; see example [ tailedfexam2 ] for details .",
    "such limit theorems have proved quite useful for semi - parametric statistical analysis of the marginal tail behavior [ drees ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "the present paper extends convergence to multivariate tail empirical processes and makes a small improvement of the results in @xcite .",
    "tail empirical processes do not capture information on location in the extreme clusters , and hence do not catch the serial extremal dependence structures which are at the center of interest in connection with , for example , heat waves or river floods .",
    "a second class of applications of our main theorems is to joint survival functions and joint distributions of the order statistic of the values within an extreme cluster .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : limittheorems ] we first introduce empirical processes of cluster functionals .",
    "this generalizes concepts first introduced by @xcite and developed further by @xcite .",
    "we then derive uniform central limit theorems for these empirical processes under quite general abstract conditions .",
    "sections [ sec3 ] contains applications to tail array sums , with the multivariate tail empirical process as a prominent example . in section [ sec4 ] we consider empirical processes of indicator variables , and , in particular , joint distributions of variables and of the order statistics in the clusters of extreme values .",
    "proofs are given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "this section first sets out the basic definitions and assumptions which are used throughout the paper and then , in section [ sect : fidi ] , gives conditions for finite - dimensional convergence of the empirical processes @xmath24 ( defined below ) .",
    "the following subsections consider asymptotic tightness and asymptotic equicontinuity of these empirical processes . as usual ,",
    "finite - dimensional convergence together with either asymptotic tightness or asymptotic equicontinuity gives convergence of @xmath25 in the space @xmath26 of bounded functions indexed by @xmath27 .",
    "for some @xmath28 , let @xmath29 be a measurable subset of @xmath1 containing 0 and let @xmath0 be a triangular array of row - wise stationary random variables ( r.v.s ) with values in @xmath29 .",
    "typically the @xmath2 have been obtained by `` renormalization '' of some other process , where the renormalization maps all nonextreme values to 0 . a generic example ( cf .",
    "the ) is @xmath11 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a stationary univariate time series . here",
    "@xmath32 tends to the right endpoint of the support of @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 is 0 unless @xmath33 is `` large , '' that is , unless @xmath35 .    the `` empirical process @xmath25 of cluster functionals '' is defined as @xmath36 here @xmath8 is the @xmath37th block of @xmath38 consecutive values of the @xmath39th row of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , there are @xmath41 blocks @xmath42 of length @xmath38 .",
    "we write @xmath43 for a `` generic block ''",
    "so that @xmath44 .",

    "cluster functionals have been introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the definition is as follows :    the set @xmath46 of vectors of arbitrary length is equipped with the @xmath47-field @xmath48 that is induced by the borel-@xmath47-fields on @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    for an arbitrary @xmath51 and @xmath52 the _ core _ @xmath53 of @xmath54",
    "is defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 the _ length of the core _ of @xmath54 is defined as @xmath57 if @xmath58 and @xmath59 if @xmath60 .",
    "a measurable map @xmath61 is called a _",
    "cluster functional _ if @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "typical examples are functionals of the type @xmath65 where @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67 , which are related to so - called tail array sums , and , in the case @xmath68 , @xmath69 which corresponds to the ( componentwise ) maximum of a cluster .",
    "many more examples will be discussed in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] .",
    "the proofs below will use the well - known `` big blocks , small blocks '' technique together with a @xmath9-mixing condition to boil down convergence to convergence of sums over i.i.d .",
    "the @xmath9-mixing coefficients ( also called the coefficients of absolute regularity ) for @xmath70 are defined by @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the @xmath47-field generated by @xmath73 .",
    "since the @xmath74 take values in a polish space , the supremum can be taken over a countable set of @xmath75 s , and hence is measurable .",
    "[ on general spaces `` sup '' has to be replaced by `` ess - sup , '' which is defined as a measurable function which is a.s .",
    "larger than or equal to @xmath76 for all @xmath77 and a.s .",
    "smaller than or equal to all other measurable functions with this property . ]",
    "in addition to the @xmath9-mixing coefficients and the lengths @xmath38 of the big blocks , the `` big blocks , small blocks '' technique uses an intermediate sequence @xmath78 of integers , the lengths of small blocks which are used to separate the big blocks in the proofs .    throughout we will use the following basic assumptions :    1 .",
    "the rows @xmath70 are stationary , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , + and 2 .",
    "+ sometimes we will also use the assumption 3 .",
    "@xmath84 .",
    "it follows from @xmath81 that @xmath85 and hence that nonzero values of @xmath74 are rare events .",
    "the most important example we have in mind are the standardized excesses given in ( [ standexceed ] ) .",
    "however , other examples occur in the context of nonparametric density estimation or nonparametric regression in a natural way ( cf .",
    "example [ densityexam ] ) . since @xmath86 is the expected number of nonzero values of @xmath87 , the assumption @xmath88 seems necessary if one wants to obtain normally distributed limits .",
    "more specifically , the assumption @xmath81 means that the probability of a block being nonzero tends to zero .",
    "in particular , it implies that if the row variables are i.i.d .",
    ", then , asymptotically , cores  or , equivalently , clusters of `` extremes''will have length one , as they intuitively should have . to see this , note that if the variables in a row are independent , then asymptotically the number of nonzero values in a block of length @xmath38 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath89 and that then the conditional probability that there are more than one nonzero value in a block , given that there is at least one nonzero value , is ( approximately ) @xmath90 .",
    "this tends to zero if and",
    "only if @xmath81 .    for a given sequence @xmath91 , assumption ( b2 ) requires a minimum rate at which the mixing coefficients @xmath92 tend to 0 as @xmath93 .",
    "the condition ( b3 ) , for example , holds if the @xmath74 are obtained by renormalizing a single absolutely regular process .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ fidisconvtheo ] and [ brackettheo ] , of lemma [ lemma : clusterconv ] and , and of lemma [ iidcompprop ] below , in fact , do not use the assumption @xmath81 of , but only that @xmath85 .",
    "the same remark applies to theorem [ condrem2 ] if one replaces condition below by the following slightly stronger version : for all @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the map @xmath96 @xmath97 is measurable .",
    "hence , these results hold also if the assumption @xmath81 is replaced by the weaker @xmath85 .",
    "it is not essential that @xmath29 is a subset of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , one may assume that @xmath74 takes on values in an arbitrary set @xmath29 .",

    "setting , a cluster functional is defined as a functional on @xmath99 whose value is not changed if @xmath100 is added at the beginning or at the end of some vector in @xmath99 .",
    "we first give a general result on the convergence of the finite - dimensional marginal distributions ( fidis ) , and then introduce simpler , but more restrictive assumptions , which also are sufficient for convergence .",
