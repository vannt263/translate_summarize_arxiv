    "evidently , we can not reproduce in the laboratory conditions existing during the big bang and during stellar evolution .",
    "but efforts to reproduce such conditions on a limited scale on earth are underway . a good example",
    "are experiments being carried out at the national ignition facility ( nif ) in livermore . in this facility",
    "the intense energy of 192 giant laser beams is focused on a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel , typically a mix of deuterium and tritium .",
    "the energy heats the surface of the pellet into a plasma , exploding off its surface , driving the remaining portion of the target inwards , and compressing it into a high density .",
    "a shock wave travels towards the center of the compressed fuel from all sides , further heating and compressing it so that fusion reactions will occur and release energy , creating temperatures and pressures similar to those that exist only in the cores of stars and giant planets and inside nuclear weapons @xcite .",
    "another example is iter , a large - scale international laboratory located in france that aims to demonstrate that it is possible to produce commercial energy from fusion .",
    "iter is based on the  tokamak \" concept of magnetic confinement , in which the plasma is contained in a doughnut - shaped vacuum vessel .",
    "a mixture of deuterium and tritium is heated to temperatures of 150 million @xmath0c , forming a hot plasma .",
    "strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the walls . from 50 mw of input power ,",
    "the iter machine is designed to produce 500 mw of fusion power .",
    "iter runs on a predicted 15 billion euros building cost , whereas nif already costs roughly us$ 5 billions .",
    "so , these are not cheap machines at all .",
    "it is very hard to reproduce conditions within stars . and the prospects of generating energy for commercial use with similar projects in the future are still uncertain . as for helping us understanding features of the big bang and of stellar evolution , iter will not be able to tell us much .",
    "it will mainly access questions on atomic and material science associated with confining a plasma at huge temperatures within a vessel and the interactions of the plasma with the walls of the vessel .",
    "while it is undeniable that this experiment will fill a knowledge gap needed for further developments in science , it will not answer crucial questions of relevance for astrophysics @xcite .",
    "maybe iter-2 will , if we can afford it .",
    "to avoid sounding too negative , i mention that nif has a good plan to provide results on atomic and nuclear physics for stellar evolution .",
    "i give a couple of examples . in the theoretical modeling of stellar evolution one",
    "relies strongly on calculations of radiation propagation through hot stellar plasmas .",
    "the coefficient entering the radiation propagation equation is called the  opacity \" .",
    "it accounts for the interaction of photons with atoms and effects such as excitation and ionization of ground - state , excited , or ionized atomic species present in the medium . for many years",
    "we have relied on a huge effort to calculate all of the atomic physics needed for stellar evolution codes in the form of opacity tables @xcite .",
    "stellar modelers have not questioned much the reliability of such tables , as one simply ca nt do better than that .",
    "but it would be a great knowledge improvement if we could effectively  measure \" opacity in the laboratory .",
    "the nif x - ray opacity platform will enable detailed studies of the radiative properties of hot dense matter over a photon energy range of 200 - 10,000 ev , also important in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "it will allow benchmarking opacities used in the standard solar model and in stellar equilibrium codes ( relevant to exoplanet habitability assessment ) and absorption / emission spectroscopy of photoionized plasmas scaled to black hole and neutron star accretion - disk conditions .",
    "the development of pulsed power and high power lasers opens a brand new perspective for the study of opacities in several dense plasmas including modeling of the atmospheres of very cool white dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "stars are powered by nuclear reactions at very low energies and , in many situations , at very high densities .",
    "usually , one needs to know what happens during binary encounters between nuclei ( a counter - example is the celebrated triple-@xmath1 reaction ) .",
    "the effects of the environment electrons are still a disputed research topic .",
    "but the main problem here is really to know the reaction rates at the energies required for stellar modeling .",
    "for example , in our sun the reaction @xmath2be@xmath3b plays a major role for the production of high energy neutrinos from the @xmath4-decay of @xmath5b .",
    "these neutrinos come directly from the center of the sun and are ideal probes of the sun s structure .",
    "john bahcall frequently said that this was the most important reaction in nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "our knowledge about this reaction has improved considerably due to new radioactive beam facilities .",
    "another example , the reaction @xmath6c@xmath7o , is extremely relevant for the fate of massive stars .",
    "it determines if the remnant of a supernova explosion becomes a black - hole or a neutron star .",
    "these two reactions are just two examples of a large number of reactions which are not yet known with the required accuracy needed in astrophysics .    nif has reported the first cross section and spectral measurements of the t(t,2n)@xmath8he reaction that is an important mirror reaction to the @xmath9he(@xmath9he,2p)@xmath8he reaction ( which is part of the proton - proton chain in hydrogen burning stars ) .",
    "these direct measurements , which were conducted at energies inaccessible by conventional accelerator - based techniques , are not affected by electron screening .",
    "measurements of the differential cross section for the elastic n-@xmath9h and n-@xmath10h scattering at 14.1 mev have also been published @xcite",
    ". the accurate determination of this reaction rate is essential for understanding how the fuel is assembled in an implosion , and for the demonstration of thermonuclear ignition and net energy gain at nif .",
    "it also opens the door for planning the use of nif and other laser powered facilities to obtain information on nuclear reaction rates at the energies occurring in stars .    the extremely low cross sections for reactions induced by charged particles and the inherent difficulty to obtaining reaction cross sections induced by low energy neutrons leads to enormous hurdles to develop reliable stellar evolution models and computer codes .",
    "chains of low energy nuclear reactions lead to complicated phenomena such as nucleosynthesis , supernovae explosions , and energy production in stars .",
    "an example is that approximately half of all stable nuclei observed in nature in the heavy element region , @xmath11 , are produced during the  r  process \" . the exact site of the r ",
    "process is not known , but one believes that it occurs in environments with large neutron densities leading to neutron capture times much smaller than the beta - decay half  lives , @xmath12 , of the nuclei involved . the most neutron ",
    "rich isotopes along the r  process path have lifetimes of less than one second ; typically 10@xmath13 to 10@xmath14s .",
    "cross sections for most of the nuclei involved are hard to measure experimentally . sometimes , theoretical calculations of the capture cross sections and of the beta  decay half  lives are the only source of input for r  process modeling .",
    "nucleosynthesis in stars is also complicated by the presence of electrons .",
    "they screen the nuclear charges , therefore increasing the fusion probability by reducing the coulomb repulsion . evidently , the fusion cross sections measured in the laboratory have to be corrected by the electron screening when used in a stellar model .",
    "this is a purely theoretical problem as one can not exactly reproduce the conditions at stellar interiors in the laboratory . at least for now .",
    "a simpler screening mechanism occurs in laboratory experiments due to the bound atomic electrons in the nuclear targets .",
    "this case has been studied in great detail experimentally , as one can control different charge states of the projectile+target system in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the experimental findings disagree systematically by a factor of two or more with theory .",
    "this is surprising as the theory for atomic screening in the laboratory relies on our basic knowledge of atomic physics . at very low energies one can use the simple adiabatic model in which the atomic electrons rapidly adjust their orbits to the relative motion between the nuclei prior to the fusion process .",
    "energy conservation requires that the larger electronic binding ( due to a larger charge of the combined system ) leads to an increase of the relative motion between the nuclei , thus increasing the fusion cross section . as a matter of fact",
    ", this enhancement has been observed experimentally .",
    "the measured values are however not compatible with the adiabatic estimate @xcite .",
    "dynamical calculations have been performed , but they obviously can not explain the discrepancy as they include atomic excitations and ionizations which reduce the energy available for fusion .",
    "other small effects , like vacuum polarization , atomic and nuclear polarizabilities , relativistic effects , etc .",
    ", have also been considered @xcite .",
    "but the discrepancy between experiment and theory remains @xcite .",
    "a possible solution of the laboratory screening problem was proposed @xcite .",
    "experimentalists often use the extrapolation of stopping power tables @xcite to obtain the average value of the projectile energy due to stopping in the target material .",
    "the stopping is due to ionization , electron - exchange , and other atomic mechanisms .",
    "however , the extrapolation is challenged by theoretical calculations which predict a lower stopping .",
    "smaller stopping was indeed verified experimentally @xcite . at very low energies , it is thought that the stopping mechanism is mainly due to electron exchange between projectile and target .",
    "this has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the simplest possible situation : proton+hydrogen collisions .",
    "the calculated stopping power was added to the nuclear stopping power mechanism , i.e. to the energy loss by the coulomb repulsion between the nuclei .",
    "the obtained stopping power is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the projectile velocity and @xmath17 .",
    "the extrapolations from stopping power tables predict a smaller value of @xmath1 . although this result seems to indicate the stopping mechanism as a possible reason for the laboratory screening problem , the theoretical calculations tend to disagree on the power of @xmath16 at low energy collisions @xcite .",
    "another calculation of the stopping power in atomic he@xmath18he collisions using the two - center molecular orbital basis was reported in ref .",
    "the agreement with the data from ref .",
    "@xcite at low energies is excellent .",
    "the agreement with the data disappears if nuclear recoil is included .",
    "in fact , the unexpected  disappearance \" of the nuclear recoil was also observed in ref . @xcite . this seems to violate a basic principle of nature , as the nuclear recoil is due to coulomb repulsion between projectile and target atoms @xcite .",
    "after several attempts , sometimes with elaborate theoretical models , little theory activity in this field has been reported .",
    "some models have been praised as solving the stellar screening problem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "i believe that this praise is more due to the use of quantum - field theoretical tools , which tends to impress low - energy experimentalists and theorists who know little about those theoretical techniques .",
    "the fact is that the present situation on screening of nuclear reactions is confusing . either experimentalists are publishing wrong analysis , or all aspects of theory might not have been considered yet @xcite",
    "i have discussed above a few ongoing efforts in nuclear astrophysics , some expensive investments to get solutions , as well as some problems that might not even be possible to study on earth . actually , much of the knowledge required for understanding the physics of the big bang and of stellar evolution can be accessed by means of indirect methods in nuclear physics .",
    "the goal of these theoretical methods , and laboratories that use them , is to take a detour following a much harder work of putting pieces together from several , sometimes seemingly unrelated , experiments . in this article",
    "i will review some of these methods and what has been and can be accomplished with them .",
    "all approaches to understand fusion reactions involve two prongs : a ) calculate an ion - ion ( usually one - dimensional ) phenomenological potential ( wood - saxon , proximity , folding , bass , etc . ) using frozen densities , or microscopic , macroscopic - microscopic methods using collective variables ( chf , atdhf , empirical methods ) , and b ) employ quantum mechanical tunneling methods for the reduced one - body problem ( wkb , iwbc ) , incorporating quantum mechanical processes by hand , including neutron transfer and excitations of the entrance channel nuclei ( cc ) . only for very light ions ,",
    "involving nuclei lighter than oxygen it is possible to devise more microscopic methods , based on binary nucleon - nucleon interactions , to obtain the fusion reaction cross sections of interest for nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "fusion cross sections can be calculated from the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the center of mass energy , @xmath21 is the reduced wavelength and @xmath22 .",
    "the cross section is proportional to @xmath23 , the area of the quantum wave .",
    "each part of the wave corresponds to different impact parameters having different probabilities for fusion . as the impact parameter increases , so does the angular momentum , hence the reason for the @xmath24 term .",
    "@xmath25 is the probability that fusion occurs at a given impact parameter , or angular momentum .",
    "the barrier penetration method ( bpm ) assumes that fusion occurs when the particle ( with mass @xmath26 ) penetrates the coulomb barrier and @xmath27 is calculated in a one - dimensional potential model , e.g. by using the wkb approximation or alike . from @xmath28 one can calculate the average value of @xmath29 from @xmath30 and many other relevant quantities .",
    "sometimes , for a better visualization , or for extrapolation to low energies , one uses the concept of _ astrophysical s - factor _ , redefining the cross section as @xmath31 , \\label{se}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , with @xmath16 being the relative velocity .",
    "the exponential function is an approximation to @xmath33 for a square - well nuclear potential plus coulomb potential , whereas the factor @xmath34 is proportional to the area appearing in eq .",
    "[ eqnf ] .    in order to use eq .",
    "[ eqnf ] one needs the nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "this is a badly known beast .",
    "it includes the effects of non - fusion channels , which might be hardly known .",
    "as it can not be calculated from first principles , one adds an imaginary part to the real potential and it becomes much more than a beast ; something really abnoxious . some have tried to tame this thing from first principles .",
    "but , except for few heroic attempts , we seem to have given up .",
    "we just fit whatever we can fit and we get whatever parameters of a potential function we can .",
    "then we simply call it the  optical potential \" .",
    "the situation is worse , as eq .",
    "[ eqnf ] does not work in most situations .",
    "a good example is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] ( top ) , taken from ref .",

    ", the fusion cross sections can be reproduced . in coupled channels",
    "schemes one expands the total wavefunction for the system as @xmath35 where @xmath36 form the channel basis , @xmath1 is a dynamical variable ( e.g. , the distance between the nuclei ) , and @xmath37 are intrinsic coordinates . inserting this expansion in the schrdinger equation yields a set of cc equations in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is whatever",

    "this goes by the name of continuum discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) calculations .",
    "there are several variations of cc equations , e.g. , a set of differential equations for the wavefunctions , instead of using basis amplitudes .",
    "coupled channels calculations with a large number of channels in continuum couplings , is one of the least controllable calculations .",
    "anything can happen because of the phases of matrix elements : the couplings can add destructively or constructively , depending on the system and on the nuclear model . such suppressions or enhancements are difficult to understand .      for reactions involving light nuclei , only a few channels are of relevance . in his case ,",
    "a real potential is enough for the treatment of fusion .",
    "for example , radiative capture cross sections of the type @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45electric ( magnetic ) l - pole ) transitions can be calculated from ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an em operator , and @xmath48 is a multipole matrix element involving bound ( @xmath49 ) and continuum ( @xmath50 ) wavefunctons . for electric multipole transitions ( @xmath51 ) ,",

    "therefore the radial integration in @xmath70 can be done accurately and the only remaining information from the many - body physics at short - distances is contained in the asymptotic normalization coefficient @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "we thus run into an effective theory for radiative capture cross sections , in which the constants @xmath69 carry all the information about the short - distance physics , where the many - body aspects are relevant .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that these arguments are reasonable for proton capture at very low energies , because of the coulomb barrier .    as the overlap integral , eq .",
