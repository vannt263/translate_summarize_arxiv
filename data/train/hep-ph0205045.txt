    "the most fundamental element of physics is the reduction principle .",
    "the large variety of macroscopic forms of matter can be traced back according to this principle , to a few microscopic constituents which interact by a small number of forces .",
    "the reduction principle has provided a guide to unraveling of the structure of physics from the macroscopic world through atomic and nuclear physics to particle physics .",
    "the laws of nature are summarized in the standard model of the particle physics .",
    "standard model is one of the successful model of the 20th century proposed by the glashow , weinberg and salam .",
    "the weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in the electroweak standard model .",
    "this model has provided the plenty of successful predictions with an impressive level of precision .    in quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "the interactions are specified by the gauge principle .",
    "the electroweak standard model is based on the gauge symmetry group @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is non - abelian electroweak - isospin group , to which three @xmath11 gauge fields are associated and @xmath12 is the abelian hypercharge group . the associated @xmath13 field and the neutral component of the @xmath11 triplet field mix to form the photon field @xmath14 and a new neutral electroweak field @xmath15 .",
    "this gauge group is spontaneously broken by the higgs mechanism ( see for example 2.3.1 ) . in the standard model ,",
    "all particles acquire their masses by interaction with another particle , the higgs boson . using the knowledge of basic symmetry group ,",
    "the gauge invariant lagrangian has been written , giving not only the interactions of the various fields including fermions but also the mass relationships for the fermions , gauge bosons and higgs boson ( see for example 2.3.2 ) .    despite lot of success of the standard model",
    ", no body can say that it is the end of physics .",
    "there are some limitations ( see for example 2.4 ) which necessiate the extension of the standard model .",
    "when we advertize the standard model , we have said that it is a model whose foundation is symmetry . in this model",
    "only those reactions are allowed which conserve the individual as well as the total lepton - flavour .",
    "thus the reactions violating the lepton flavour can not be contained in the standard model and cause its extension .",
    "this extension is commonly known as physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the problem of the physics beyond the standard model has been studied for a considerable length of time . in the past few years",
    "substantial progress has been made to understand this physics .",
    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are among the most promising candidates to understand this new physics .",
    "using the experimental bounds on the three boby lepton flavor violating decays we have found the bounds on the two body lfv decays .",
    "these bounds are suppressed by the form factors and was named as the dynamical suppression of the lfv bounnds .",
    "the detailed study of these lfv  decays is presented in chapter 3 .",
    "the bounds thus found on the two body lfv decays are used for further studies of lfv decays in some interesting reactions .",
    "today there is evidence for a very important new property of the neutrinos i.e. they have mass and , as a result mix with each other to lead the phenomenon of neutrino osscillation .",
    "evidences that the neutrinos are massive particles come from three anomalous effects , the lsnd excess , the atmospheric anomaly and solar neutrino deficit .",
    "but the atmospheric and the solar results are the most convincing one.the lsnd has the small probability compared to the atmospheric and solar anomalies . in order to incorporate neutrino mass",
    "we must violate the standard model and introduce the new concept of lfv . a seesaw model of neutrino masses @xcite which involve right handed singlet neutrinos of mass @xmath16 of the order tev , is also disscussed using the lfv physics at loop order .",
    "the main purpose of this model is that there is no new physics beyond @xmath5 tev .",
    "it is however , shown that even if one keeps @xmath16 at @xmath5 tev , the present bounds on @xmath0 requires that new higgs boson , necessary in this model , to have mass larger than @xmath7 tev .",
    "this necessiates a new physics beyond the tev energy scale defeating the orgional motivation of the model .",
    "this is discussed in chapter 4 , where it is also shown that the lfv anamolous muou decay @xmath17 can not significantly contribute to the lsnd dar result , at least when we use @xmath1 as constrained by @xmath0 in a model independent way .",
    "the proposal of the symmetry group for the electroweak theory , @xmath18 , was made by glashow in 1961 .",
    "his motivation was to unify weak and electromagetic interactions into a symmetry group that contained @xmath19 .",
    "the prediction includes the existance of four physical vector boson eigenstates , @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 obtained from the rotations of the weak eigenstate .",
    "in particular , the rotation by the weak angle @xmath23 which defines the @xmath15 weak boson was introduced already in this work .",
    "furthermore the correct structure of weak neutral current mediated by @xmath15-boson was also obtained.the massive weak bosons @xmath24 and @xmath15 were considered as mediators of weak interactions .",
    "this model has serious problem of giving masses to @xmath24 and @xmath15 , since the gauge symmetry would predict their masses to be zero.the vector boson masses @xmath25 and @xmath26 were parameters introduced by hand and the interaction lagrangian was that of the ivb theory .",
    "the mass term for vector bosons in the lagrangian not only destroyed the gauge symmetry but also normalizability of the theory .",
    "another key ingredient for the building of the electroweak theory is provided by the goldstone theorem which was introduced by nambu in 1960 and proved and studied with generality by goldstone in 1961 and by goldstone , salam and weinberg in 1962 .",
    "this theorem states the existance of massless spinless particles as an implication of spontaneous symmetry breaking of global symmetries .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking of local ( gauge ) symmetries , needed for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry @xmath9 , was studied by p.higgs , f. englert and r. brout , guralnik , hagen and kibble in 1964 .",
    "the procedure for this spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetries is reffered to as the higgs mechanism .",
    "the electroweak theory as it is now known was formulated by weinberg and independently by salam in 1968 who incorporated the gauge group @xmath18 introduced by the glashow earlier .",
    "this theory , commonly called glashow - weinberg salam model or standard model ( sm ) , was built with the help of the gauge principle and incorporated all the good phenomenological properities of the pregauged theories of the weak interactions , and in particular those of the ivb theory .",
    "it incorporated the idea of spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry by introducing higgs doublet . in this way the weak vector bosons acquaired their masses with out destroying the normalizability of the gauge",
    "theory.the sm is indeed a gauge theory of the electroweak interactions based on the gauge symmetry @xmath9 and the intermediate vector bosons , @xmath27 and @xmath15 are the four associated gauge bosons .",
    "the gauge boson masses , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are generated by the higgs mechanism in the electroweak theory and , as a consequence , it respects unitarity at all energies and is renormalizable .",
    "the important proof of renormlizability of gauge theories with and without spontaneous symmetry was provided by t hooft in 1971 .    the first firm indication that the standard model was the correct theory of electroweak interaction was the discovery of weak neutral current in 1973 as predicted by the model .",
    "this also provided the first measurement of @xmath28 . by using this experimental input for @xmath29 and the values of electromagnetic coupling and @xmath30 ,",
    "the sm provided the first estimates for @xmath31 and @xmath32 which were discovered experimently in 1983 at the predicted masses .",
    "another important ingredients of the sm are : fermion family replication , quark mixing and cp violation .",
    "the success of the sm was clearly the discovery of the gauge bosons @xmath33 and @xmath15 at the sps collider at cern in 1983 . since then there have been plenty of tests of the sm even at quantum level @xcite .      in order to give an argument for the choice of @xmath9 gauge group for electroweak unification , it is sufficient to consider the @xmath34 component of the charged weak current that we write now in the form , @xmath35 and we have introduced the lepton doublet notation and the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are pauli matrices , @xmath38 the three generators @xmath39 of unitary , unimodular group @xmath10 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath40 = i\\epsilon _ { ijk}i_{k}\\ ] ] i.e. the same commutation relation as satisfied by @xmath36 viz @xmath41 = 2i\\epsilon _ { ijk}\\tau _ { k},\\ ] ] since for the fundamental representation of @xmath10 @xmath42    note that in the charged currents there are just two generators @xmath43 and @xmath44 . a third generator @xmath45 is needed in order to close the @xmath10 algebera .",
    "this implies the third current that is relevent for the electroweak interactions , @xmath46    obviously this can not be identified with the @xmath47 which is @xmath48 .",
    "this clearly indicate that @xmath10 is not sufficient for electroweak unification and it must be extended and the simple extension is to consider the group @xmath49    the gell - mann nishijima relation , @xmath50 where ,    @xmath51 electric charge , @xmath52 weak isospin , @xmath53 weak hypercharge ; implies @xmath54 the corresponding relation amoung the current is @xmath55 thus @xmath56    therefore , if the following are used as inputs @xmath57 one can get @xmath58 as output , @xmath59 this clearly indicates that @xmath60 due to symmetry breaking the two neutral currents @xmath61 and @xmath62 will mix to give two physical currents of which one must be identified with electromagnetic current @xmath63 and the second current will be new currents .",
