    "during the last decade accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ) have revealed a number of interesting phenomena and have opened a new window to the physics of accretion onto neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "the first of such systems was discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sax  j1808.43658 ) , presenting the first prove of an accreting neutron star having both millisecond spin period and dynamically important magnetic field .",
    "ten amps have been discovered to date , and in three of them millisecond x - ray pulsations have been seen to appear in and disappear from the persistent emission , producing predominant ( hete  j1900.1 - 2455 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) intermittent ( sax  j1748.9 - 2021 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or very rare ( aql  x-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) episodes of pulsations .",
    "this implies that the amp within them is only active or visible during a relatively small fraction of the time , which may provide a link with the much more numerous class of non - pulsating neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns - lmxbs ) .",
    "one way to study accretion onto compact objects is to analyze the aperiodic variability in the x - ray flux coming from these sources , which tells us about processes occuring in the inner accretion flow @xcite .",
    "such timing of the accretion flow , combined with a study of the x - ray spectrum , reveals different `` accretion states '' .",
    "we show in this paper three different amps in three different accretion states , we describe their aperiodic variability and quantify their outburst fluence .",
    "the sixth amp was discovered on december @xmath0 , 2004 : igr  j00291 + 5934 @xcite .",
    "coherent pulsations were found at a frequency of 598.9  hz , modulated by the @xmath12.5  hr orbital motion @xcite .",
    "follow up observations of the outburst , which lasted about two weeks , were performed by _ rxte _ ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "our study of igr  j00291 + 5934 showed what still constitutes the strongest x - ray variability seen in a ns - lmxb , namely the fractional rms was @xmath150% .",
    "we also measured the lowest charactersitic frequencies ever seen in a ns - lmxb , with a break in the flat - topped power spectrum at @xmath10.04  hz ( see figure  1 and ref . * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details and discussion ) .",
    "this amp is therefore an extreme example of what is often called `` extreme island '' state of atoll sources ( a low - luminosity class of ns - lmxb , see * ? ? ?",
    "on june @xmath2 , 2007 , a new x - ray transient was discovered @xcite with the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _",
    "swift_. follow up _ rxte _ observations revealed that this was the eighth discovered amp and showed a pulse frequency of @xmath1182  hz and an orbital period of @xmath154  minutes @xcite .",
    "the outburst lasted about two weeks ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we analyzed the aperiodic variability of the source , comparing it with other amps and with atoll sources .",
    "we thereby classified swift  j1756.9 - 2508 as an atoll source in the extreme island state . using both pca and hexte data we detected a hard tail in its energy spectrum extending up to 100  kev , fully consistent with such source and state classification @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that so far all amps show spectral and timing ( except for the shifts in the frequency - frequency correlations , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) properties identical to those of atoll sources , which suggests that low mass accretion rate is a necessary ( even though seemingly not sufficient ) ingredient to make an amp .",
    "a new transient x - ray source was discovered in the galactic bulge region on february @xmath3 , 2003 .",
    "subsequently , coherent pulsations were detected at a frequency of 190.6  hz turning the new system , xte  j1807294 , into the fourth discovered amp @xcite .",
    "an orbital period of @xmath140 minutes was determined @xcite , still the shortest among amps .",
    "the outburst was followed by _ rxte _ during five months ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "we discovered seven pairs of twin khz quasi - periodic oscillations in xte  j1807294 @xcite , with a frequency separation approximately equal to the spin frequency ( see m. van der klis contribution in these proceedings for further details ) .",
    "an important question that still remains open is why amps show pulsations whereas most of ns - lmxbs do not .",
    "the solution proposed by @xcite invokes screening of the magnetic field in `` classical '' ns - lmxbs by a time - averaged mass accretion rate higher than that of amps . in order to test this and other theories ( ns crust cooling , binary evolution ) a careful estimate of",
    "how much mass falls onto the neutron star surface is of capital importance @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we measure the unabsorbed 2 - 200  kev flux during the three amp outbursts mentioned above , using data from both pca and hexte onboard _",
    "rxte_. we fit the broadband , background and deadtime corrected , energy spectra with an absorbed disk blackbody plus power law model ( fixing the column density to the galactic value in the source direction ) . for xte",
    "j1807294 we use data from the pca scans of the galactic bulge @xcite to cover the rise and the final decay , as there are no pointed _ rxte _ observations during those parts of the outburst . in the case of swift  j1756.92508",
    "we use data from the _ swift_-bat transient monitor , as most of the outburst had no _ rxte _ pointings .",
    "we calibrate the conversion between pca - scan / bat and pca&hexte fluxes in those parts of the outbursts where both fluxes are available , thus implicitly assuming that the spectral shape does not vary drastically .",
    "the resulting lightcurves , translated to luminosities in units of 2.5@xmath4 erg / s , are shown in figure  2 .",
    "table  1 shows our measurements of the fluence , radiated energy and peak luminosity for the three outbursts studied ( see note on distances used therein ) .",
    "we also show in table  1 the range spanned by the break frequency in the power spectrum , which indicates the relative change in x - ray variability frequencies , as well as the orbital period of each system ."
