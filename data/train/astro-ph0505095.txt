    "in the standard cosmological paradigm the universe is predominantly filled with dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the success of this paradigm is indisputable .",
    "it explains a multitude of observational data over a wide range of scales , from rotation curves of local galaxies to the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at high redshifts .    despite this success ,",
    "several fundamental problems remain to be resolved .",
    "although the best evidence for dm is the flattening of rotation curves of many spiral galaxies , the scenario does not explain the shape of these curves in the inner regions of some galaxies ( e.g de blok et al .",
    "2001 , hayashi et  al .",
    "the dm scenario predicts specific correlations between the internal properties of clusters of galaxies ( e.g. the mass vs temperature , entropy vs temperature ) . while such correlations are observed , their parameters do not agree with the model predictions .",
    "there are various puzzles related to the evolution of the galaxy population as well .",
    "all these problems and several others can probably be attributed to physical processes unrelated to the dark matter .",
    "but they do allow us some leeway in exploring other alternatives to the dm scenario .",
    "one possibility is to superimpose additional forces acting only in the dark sector ( e.g. gradwohl & frieman j.a .",
    "1992 ; farrar & peebles 2004 ; sealfon et  al .",
    "2005 ; shirata et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "these forces can work in the direction of boosting the clustering on small scales , leaving the larger scales intact .",
    "several desirable features follow from this scenario ( e.g. nusser , gubser & peebles 2005 ) .    another approach is to modify newton s @xmath8 law for the force of gravity , relinquishing the dm scenario altogether .",
    "this approach was originally introduced to account for the flattening of rotation curves without invoking dark matter ( milgrom 1983 ; bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    "after all , the dm particle has yet to be discovered ( bertone  2004 ) and we lack an experimental verification of newton s laws at low accelerations .",
    "the essence of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is to replace newton s law of gravity at sufficiently low accelerations @xmath9 is often used instead of @xmath10 . ] by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is found to give the best results in fitting the rotation curves .",
    "recently a few attempts have been made to confront mond with observations of the large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe ( mcgaugh 1999 , sanders 2001 , nusser 2002 , knebe & gibson 2004 , mcgaugh 2004 ) . when mond is applied to a uniform background",
    "it predicts the collapse of any finite region in the universe regardless of the mean density in that region ( e.g. , felten 1984 , sanders 1998 ) . to solve this problem sanders ( 2001 ) proposed a two - field lagrangian based theory of mond in which the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background cosmology remains intact in the absence of fluctuations .",
    "he argued that this theory leads to lss resembling newtonian dynamics with cdm - like initial conditions .",
    "more recently bekenstein ( 2004 ) proposed a general relativistic version of mond in which the behaviour of cosmological background is very close to a frw .",
    "nusser ( 2002 ) employed the `` jeans swindle '' ( binney & tremain 1987 ) to write a mond type relation between the fluctuations in the density and the gravitational force field .",
    "the relation can be derived from a lagrangian and is equivalent to sanders two - field theory in the limit of small coupling ( sanders 1998 ) . and",
    "it seems that a similar relation can be derived from bekenstein s ( 2004 ) theory as well .",
    "nusser ( 2002 ) then implemented this relation in a collisionless n - body code to simulate the evolution of lss under mond .",
    "this work showed that mond , albeit with @xmath13 smaller than the standard value inferred from rotation curves , produces lss similar to that seen in simulations of viable variants of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario .",
    "knebe & gibson ( 2004 ) used high resolution simulations of collisioness particles to study the lss and `` halo '' profiles in mond .",
    "according to these authors , mond leads to reasonable predictions for the lss even for the standard value of @xmath13 .",
    "knebe & gibson also examined the properties of halos and concluded that density profiles in mond have similar shape to the profiles seen in newtonian simulations .",
    "a mondian universe is dominated by ordinary baryonic matter made mainly of primordial hydrogen and helium .",
    "baryons in cosmological systems have a relatively short mean free path , and should be treated as a hydrodynamical fluid .",
    "this fluid can collapse under its self - gravity , shock - heat during the collapse , cool , and form stars .",
    "reliable three dimensional simulations of these processes are difficult and very cpu demanding , even in newtonian dynamics where the poisson equation can be solved efficiently . the problem is greatly simplified if one restricts the analysis to symmetric perturbations .",
    "stachniewicz & kutschera ( 2004 ) adopted this approach to the collapse of low mass objects at high redshifts using a spherically symmetric hydrodynamical code with mondian gravity . in this paper",
    "we address the formation of clusters of galaxies in mond using hydrodynamical simulations of spherically symmetric perturbations having initial power law profiles .",
    "the perturbations are evolved using a one dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamical code . cooling and heat conduction",
    "are not included in this code .",
    "these processes are important in galaxies and small groups of galaxies .",
    "however , they are likely to play a minor role in governing the evolution of the gaseous intercluster medium ( icm ) in the outer regions of massive clusters .",
    "several works have confronted mond with observations of clusters ( e.g. the & white 1988 ; aguirre et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "aguirre et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) assumed the hydrostatic equilibrium to derive mond temperature profiles from x - ray data of three nearby clusters .",
    "they concluded that mond predictions for the temperature profiles disagree with observations .",
    "our approach here is to derive cluster properties resulting from the dynamical evolution of initial perturbations .",
    "this approach will enable us to make detailed predictions independently of the observations , and to test several key assumptions such as that of the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we expect it to provide stringent constraints on mond from the observational data .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",

    "this is another manifestation of the mismatch between temperature profiles in mond and the observations .",
    "in this paper we aimed at : ( 1 ) studying the density and temperature profiles of spherically symmetric perturbations evolved under mondian gravity , and ( 2 ) comparing the predicted profiles with recent x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "a key finding here is that the profiles in mond acquire a nearly universal shape independently of the initial fluctuations .",
    "this is in contrast to the newtonian theory where the profiles are sensitive to the shape of the initial profiles .",
    "the shock radius in mond is nearly independent of the amplitude of the initial perturbation while in the newtonian case it is proportional to the amplitude ( see eq .  [ eq : rta ] ) .",
    "the insensitivity to the initial density profile , leaves very little leeway in matching mond predictions to observed properties of the icm . in newtonian dynamics",
    ", one can , to a great extent , resort to varying initial conditions to try to match the observations . in mond",
    "one has to depend , almost entirely , on non - gravitational physical processes .",
    "one such process may be thermal conduction .",
    "the thermal conduction time scale is estimated as @xmath205 . assuming a thermal conductivity , @xmath206 , of 0.2 times the spitzer value @xmath207 ( spitzer 1962 )",
    ", we obtained @xmath208 for @xmath209 , @xmath210 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] at @xmath211 ) , and @xmath212 . therefore , thermal conduction can help , especially for the highest temperature clusters of @xmath213 . for @xmath214 conduction seems inefficient at producing the desired temperature profile . note that we have used the cosmic time @xmath215 to estimate @xmath216 . in the outer regions",
    "one should actually take @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the time at which these regions collapsed and shock - heated . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : betaz ] the shock radius have grown from @xmath219 at @xmath183 to @xmath220 at @xmath52 .",
    "the time interval between @xmath183 and @xmath52 is @xmath221 which reduces @xmath222 by a factor of @xmath223 .",
    "non - gravitational heating of the icm can also be invoked to alter the profiles , but it is hard to imagine a realistic mechanism that will flatten the temperature in the outer regions ( e.g. borgani et  al . 2005 ) .    our findings as well as those of previous authors , pause some puzzles for mond to overcome .",
    "while newtonian dynamics has its own problems in matching the cluster data , the lack of dependence on the initial conditions , makes mond harder to reconcile with these data .",
    "we are deeply indebted to alexey vikhlinin for kindly providing his _ chandra _ temperature profiles .",
    "an thanks tom theuns for advice on the numerical code . an is also grateful to arif babul and scott kay for many stimulating conversations .",
