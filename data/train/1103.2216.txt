    "recent progress in quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) technology towards high power cw operation and off - the - shelf availability for a widening wavelength range has enlarged their application fields , for instance in molecular spectroscopy , lidar applications or thz imaging .",
    "thanks to their wide tunability and integrability , qcls are superseding alternative sources such as molecular gas lasers or lead - salt lasers  @xcite .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of qcls is their extreme sensitivity to optical feedback that may prevent stable operation , hence the need for high optical isolation , especially for high - resolution spectroscopy applications in which precise frequency control is required .",
    "qcls are linearly polarized sources .",
    "a simple way to achieve optical isolation is to use a wire grid polarizer and a quarter - wave plate  @xcite .",
    "however , the price to pay is rather high since the laser beam has to keep a circular polarization : any modification of the feedback beam polarization reduces the isolation ratio .",
    "the alternative solution relies on the faraday effect , and was studied between the 60 s and the 90 s by several authors in the context of co@xmath3 laser applications .",
    "mid - infrared faraday isolation has been demonstrated using several faraday media and different processes such as free carrier contribution at room temperature or interband and free carrier spin contributions at cryogenic temperatures @xcite .",
    "isolation ratios up to 30  db and insertion losses of 1.5  db ( 71  % transmission ) have been reported .",
    "n - doped insb , which benefits from a strong free carrier faraday effect , appears to be the most promising material in the 9 - 10  @xmath0 m range  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it also suffers from rather large optical absorption and low heat conductivity , which make it unsuited for isolation of high - power co@xmath3 lasers .",
    "for this reason , development efforts were stopped , and currently no mid - ir faraday isolator is commercially available .",
    "our initial motivation to fabricate such a device is the experiment developed in the paris group , which we briefly describe here to illustrate an application requiring both a high isolation ratio and linearly polarized light .",
    "the experiment aims at a high - precision measurement of a doppler - free two - photon vibrational transition frequency in the h@xmath4 molecular ion in the 9.2  @xmath0 m range in order to obtain a new determination of the proton - to - electron mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "we developed a cw qcl source with a frequency control at the khz level by a phase lock against a stabilized co@xmath3 laser  @xcite .",
    "the qcl beam ( @xmath154  mw ) is mode - matched to a high finesse  ( @xmath11000 ) fabry - perot cavity , that is required both to ensure a doppler - free geometry with perfectly counterpropagating beams , and to enhance the transition rate ( two - photon ro - vibrational transitions in h@xmath4 being very weak ) .",
    "optical feedback from the high - finesse cavity is a problem in such an experiment ; in the initial setup , isolation was obtained by combining a quarter - wave plate and polarizer with an acousto - optic modulator providing a 6  db additional isolation through its strongly polarization - dependent efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the total isolation ratio , slightly over 30  db , was just sufficient to achieve stable operation of the qcl .",
    "however , probing the transitions with a circularly polarized beam has two important drawbacks : ( i ) two - photon transition rates in h@xmath4 are almost an order of magnitude smaller with respect to the linear polarization case  @xcite , and ( ii ) transition frequencies are much more sensitive ( by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude ) to the zeeman shift due to the @xmath5 selection rule  @xcite , requiring a high level of magnetic field control .    in this paper",
    ", we report the performances of the device we have fabricated , which is based on the same material ( n - doped insb ) as most earlier realizations , but takes advantage of improvements in wafer quality and permanent magnets . after a brief review of faraday effect in insb",
    ", we describe the isolator setup and our experimental results . in the last section",
    ", we compare the performances of our device with published data and discuss the feasibility of a double - stage mid - infrared faraday isolator .",
    "at room temperature , infrared absorption and faraday effect in n - doped insb are dominated by the free electron contribution  @xcite and can be described in the frame of the drude model .",
    "the polarization rotation in a magnetic field b for a wafer thickness",
    "l is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the verdet constant  @xcite , and the absorption coefficient @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the material refractive index , @xmath11 is the carrier effective mass , @xmath12 the carrier density and @xmath13 the effective carrier relaxation time .",

    "note that both faraday rotation and absorption follow a @xmath20 law .",
    "the relevant figure of merit when assessing the performances of a material for optical isolation is the faraday rotation @xmath21 per db of attenuation and per tesla . when assessing device performances ( with a given magnetic field ) , it is best to use the faraday rotation per db attenuation @xmath22 .",
    "they are given by @xmath23 in order to optimize @xmath22 , one should have a @xmath24-field as strong as possible , and semiconductors of low effective mass and low resistivity , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the figures of merit appear to be independent of the carrier density @xmath12 , but a more detailed approach allows to study the influence of donor concentration and temperature  @xcite ; for insb at 300 k , the optimal value is around @xmath25  2.10  @xmath26  @xmath27 .",

    "the wafers come from different slices of the same insb ingot and exhibit slightly different characteristics that are reported in table  [ tab_wafer_charact ] .",

    "figure  [ fig_rotation ] shows the polarization rotation as a function of the wafer position @xmath44 in the magnet .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the present results could be improved further in several ways .",
    "the simplest one is to use commercially available high - quality wire grid polarizers with 98% transmission and 1:500 extinction ratio . with such polarizers ,",
    "a 27  db isolation ratio is expected , and the insertion losses could be reduced to 1.1  db .",
    "the faraday isolator figure of merit @xmath22 can also be increased using higher @xmath24-fields and thinner wafers .",
    "similar simple permanent magnet configurations giving 1.7  t and 2.1  t fields have been patented  @xcite or reported  @xcite . with 2.1  t",
    ", the wafer thickness can be reduced to 215  @xmath0 m , resulting in a 94.7% wafer transmission ( 92% including the residual reflection losses after coating ) for a single stage isolator , i.e. a 0.6  db insertion loss assuming high quality ( 98% transmission ) polarizers .",
    "very high isolation ratios are usually achieved using a double stage faraday rotator , with two wafers and three polarizers . in that case , it is crucial to lower polarizer and wafer losses , since with presently reported values the overall transmission of such a device would be only @xmath50 ( for example , in h@xmath4 two - photon spectroscopy the gain in transition probability is reduced to a factor of 2.4 ) . using a 2.1  t field and high quality polarizers",
    ", one can expect a 79% isolator transmission ( 1  db insertion loss ) with an isolation ratio exceeding 50  db for a double stage isolator .",
    "we have reported the analysis of faraday rotation in n - doped insb wafers and the operation of an optical faraday isolator with a 30  db isolation ratio and 1.9  db insertion loss at 9.166  @xmath0 m .",
    "we have also discussed possible improvements and shown the feasibility of a room temperature double stage isolator which would ensure @xmath5150  db isolation ratio with 1  db insertion loss .",
    "such a device significantly extends the range of qcl applications , especially in high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the present results can be extended to the transparency range of insb .",
    "the short wavelength limit is @xmath527.5  @xmath0 m due to the @xmath53  ev gap energy .",
    "the long wavelength limit is @xmath1  30  @xmath0 m due to the plasma frequency cut - off @xmath54 . for shorter wavelengths in the 4 - 8  @xmath0 m range , n - doped inas could be used , but with higher absorption and reduced performances  @xcite .",
