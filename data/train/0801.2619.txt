    "the bosonization has been an indispensable tool for one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting fermion studies .",
    "the advantage of the bosonization is that it allows to treat exactly the fermion interaction operator .",
    "this operator is marginal in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense , and therefore can not be dealt with the help of perturbative approximations .",
    "however the bosonization becomes inconvenient when one needs to go beyond the marginal operators .",
    "for example , when calculating the coulomb drag resistivity in the system of two 1d wires @xcite , it is necessary to account for the dispersion curvature @xmath3 of the fermions @xcite which is an irrelevant operator . in the language of the bosonization",
    "such operator introduces interaction between the bosons with the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "this destroys the solubility of the bosonized hamiltonian .",
    "moreover the coulomb drag resistivity @xmath0 is non - analytical in @xmath3 : @xmath4 this indicates that simple perturbation theory in orders of @xmath3 is not applicable .",
    "different methods was used to address the issue of the non - linear dispersion @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these papers either rely on numerical calculation or exact solubility or employ uncontrollable approximations or devise methods suitable for a particular task at hand",
    ". no universal approach emerged from those works .",
    "a detour around the bosonization was proposed in @xcite where it was shown that a generic tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model of 1d interacting spinless fermions may be mapped on a system of free fermionic quasiparticles with weak irrelevant ( in rg sense ) interactions .",
    "the latter approach was particularly convenient for evaluation of the density - density correlation function .",
    "it was demonstrated that this correlation function is proportional to the density - density correlation function of the free fermions plus small corrections due to the interactions between the quasiparticles . in ref .",
    "@xcite the density - density retarded propagator @xmath5 and the density spectral function @xmath6 were determined to zeroth order in the quasiparticle interaction .",
    "since the coulomb drag resistivity is a functional of @xmath7 , it is natural to apply the method of @xcite to the problem of calculating the coulomb drag resistivity .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "more specifically , we show below that at small temperature @xmath8 , where the coefficient @xmath9 is a decreasing function of the in - chain repulsion , and that correction due to the quasiparticle interactions @xmath10 vanishes quicker than @xmath1 : @xmath11 .",
    "these are two main results derived below .",
    "this paper corrects @xcite and the previous version of this preprint @xcite . in these two publications the zero - temperature form of the spectral function is used for calculation of the finite - temperature drag .",
    "this mistake is not crucial for it does not alter neither @xmath1 behavior of @xmath0 , nor @xmath2 behavior of @xmath10 .",
    "it does change the @xmath12 numerical coefficient in front of formula for @xmath0 , as well as details of @xmath0 and @xmath10 derivations .",

    "a non - perturbative approach to handle hamiltonian @xmath17 was proposed in ref .",

    "the chemical potential shift @xmath40 in eq.([hqp ] ) is also induced by the transformation @xmath18 .",
