    "outflows are ubiquitous in astrophysics : they rather paradoxically accompany collapse processes , whether the collapse of a molecular cloud core to form a young stellar object , the collapse of matter onto a galaxy s central black hole , or the collapse of stars into white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes",
    ". outflows are important to study for their links to those basic collapse and accretion processes , but also because understanding outflows is crucial to studying the impact and feedback of those winds on the surrounding medium .",
    "outflows from agns are interesting for both of the reasons given above .",
    "while there is widespread agreement that agns function via accretion from subparsec - scale disks onto super - massive black holes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the detailed physical processes controlling , for instance , the generation of the continuum , obscuration of agns , transferring matter from large ( @xmath1  kpc ) to small scales , as well as the launching mechanisms for outflows , are still not well understood .",
    "most importantly here , while @xmath250% of agns show evidence for outflowing uv and x - ray absorption @xcite , the physical mechanisms powering those outflows remain unclear .",
    "magnetic fields are a leading candidate for launching winds in both agns and young stellar objects @xcite . in addition , given the high - flux radiation field in some agns ( especially the high - luminosity quasars ) , it is also natural and useful to examine radiative acceleration of outflows @xcite .",
    "some groups have also combined these two mechanisms , addressing the importance of radiative acceleration within magnetic winds @xcite .",
    "apart from these two models , thermal wind models have also been proposed ; several papers have examined x - ray heated winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the possibility of thermally - driven ( parker ) winds and the ability of those winds to explain observations of low velocity ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) x - ray absorption features . in this paper",
    ", we also examine the possibility of parker winds , but in a different context ; we test these wind models against spatially resolved observations of the kinematics of forbidden - emission lines ( here , [ o  iii ] ) in local , low - luminosity agns .",
    "forbidden - line emission is very useful for testing models of agn outflows and their interaction with surrounding gas because such emission is seen at relatively large distances from the nucleus ( of order 100  pc ) .",
    "a large distance for the emitting gas is consistent with the observed narrow ( low velocity dispersion ) emission lines ; this region is therefore known as the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the large distance to the nlr is important because whereas many of the physical processes in agns occur on scales much too small to directly observe and resolve , the nlr can be and is resolved in some agns .",
    "resolving the nlr is largely a product of the high resolution observations of the _ hubble space telescope _ , although early ground - based studies of ngc  4151 revealed the possibility of large scale acceleration as early as 1990 @xcite .",
    "more recent spectra taken with the _ hst _ s space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , however , allow high spatial and spectral resolution studies of the nlr , offering data sufficient to constrain photoionization and dynamical models of the outskirts of agns .",
    "in particular , @xcite have mapped the kinematics of up to three different flux components of [ o  iii ]  emission in ngc 4151 in five different slits across the observed nlr .",
    "in addition , previous studies of the nlr of ngc 4151 @xcite and of the nlr of other agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found similar kinematics .",
    "the most striking result from these studies is the apparent near - linear increases in velocity ( @xmath5 ) over scales from 10  pc to 100  pc and then an apparent linear decrease in velocity at larger scales ; further , this trend has been observed on _ similar scales _ in _ three different objects _ : ngc  4151 @xcite , ngc  1068 @xcite , and mrk  3 @xcite .",
    "these observations may help constrain the driving forces behind large - scale agn winds . at first glance ,",
    "both radiative acceleration and magnetic acceleration are problematic with respect to these observations : both mechanisms accelerate gas to its escape velocity on length scales of order the launching radius .",
    "if the outflow is launched from an accretion disk , the launching scale must be @xmath6  pc @xcite , and therefore both radiative and magnetic winds would be expected to reach their terminal velocities by approximately 10  pc from the central source .",
    "another possibility for the driving is thermal , or parker , winds : could such thermal winds accelerate gas slowly enough to explain the observations ?",
    "this seems plausible , especially if we allow the [ o  iii ]  emission to originate in clouds dragged along with the wind , which would further slow the observed acceleration .",
    "we can then ask what constraints these observations of @xmath5 outflows place on thermal wind models . also , just as important : in the three cases mentioned above , what decelerates the gas ? finally , such models may help constrain the geometry of the nlr @xcite .",
    "to address these questions we must build detailed kinematic and photoionization models of the core of agns and their winds . in this paper",
    ", we build such a thermal wind model ( in  [ parkerwindmodel ] ) , adapted to considerations of large - scale flows in agns , and then apply that model to _",
    "hst_/stis observations of ngc  4151 .",
    "the particular spectral energy distribution and @xmath7 profile in ngc  4151 are introduced in  [ ngc4151inputs ] . the particular mass profile that we adopt allows for a good first - order approximation to the wind as roughly isothermal ,",
    "so isothermal wind models are applied to nlr observations of ngc  4151 in  [ isothermal ] .",
    "isothermality in agn winds is then tested in the particular case of these thermal winds ( and tested against variations in the input spectrum ) in  [ testingisothermality ] .",
    "we find that thermal wind models face very stringent constraints that make it very unlikely that they can explain the observed nlr kinematics , due chiefly to the effects of adiabatic cooling which ensures that the winds are not isothermal , and in fact cool on large scales ( @xmath8  pc ) .",
    "we first review the basic parker ( solar ) wind model (  [ overviewparkerwind ] ) , and then introduce changes to that model that must be included when hypothesizing a large - scale parker wind at the center of an active galaxy : the increase in enclosed mass as a function of radius , adiabatic cooling for outflows at such large distances , and finally the effects of wind / cloud and wind / ism drag .",
    "a parker wind can be thought of as an extended thermal wind .",
    "to explain this terminology , first consider the simplest picture of a thermal wind , where gas at its launch point is heated to high temperature such that that its sound speed is greater than the escape speed ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this requirement can be recast to ask if the gas temperature is greater than the `` escape temperature '' @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the mass of the central object , @xmath12 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath13 is the launching radius , and @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "an inherent difficulty with this picture , in relation to the nlr data discussed in the introduction , is that there is no extended acceleration as is apparently observed .",
    "a parker wind also depends on thermal effects , but with the major difference that the gas is not heated at the base of the wind to have @xmath9 .",
    "the wind is therefore more like an extended atmosphere , where , at the base of the wind , @xmath15 .",
    "the key difference , though , between a parker wind and an atmosphere is that if such strongly bound gas is heated as a function of height such that the temperature drops more slowly than @xmath16 , where @xmath7 is the enclosed mass and @xmath17 is the spherical radius , the atmosphere must expand supersonically ( explained in more detail later in this section ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to rather slow acceleration , compared , for instance , to radiatively - driven and magnetically - driven winds .",
    "as mentioned previously , therefore , this model is therefore appealing for the nlr of agns .",
    "this is especially true of ngc  4151 , as photoionization analyses have shown that the central agn continuum dominates the heating of the nlr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these photoionization analyses also show that shock heating ( which could , for example , result from an interaction with a collimating medium , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also not likely to be important .",
    "( we note , though , that kraemer et al . 2001 find the possibility of shock heating near the start of deceleration of the wind at approximately @xmath18  pc . )",
    "it is also possible in some agns for the central radio jet to affect the nlr by increasing the nlr line widths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but that does not appear to be the case for ngc  4151 @xcite .    to examine this possibility in more detail , we start with the basic equation for an isothermal parker wind : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the one - dimensional radial velocity , and @xmath17 is the spherical radius .",
    "two important insights can be seen from examining equation  [ dvdreq ] closely .",
    "first , we note the importance of the `` critical point '' in this equation . as stated earlier , gas at the base of a parker wind is gravitationally bound , so that @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the numerator of equation  [ dvdreq ] must be negative at the base of the wind ; since the denominator is also negative ( @xmath22 ) , a positive acceleration results .",
    "however , as the wind moves outward and @xmath20 increases , eventually @xmath23 and the denominator of equation  [ dvdreq ] becomes zero . in order for the parker wind equation to be physically meaningful , the numerator must also be equal to zero at the same time the denominator becomes zero , so @xmath24 must equal @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) must be true when @xmath23 .",
    "this requirement sets the location of the critical point : this is the ( @xmath17,@xmath20 ) pair that the solution must `` thread '' so that the wind solution can describe a flow that continuously accelerates . in fact",
    ", the solution that passes through this critical point is the only solution that allows an outflow to large distances and to speeds above the escape velocity .",
    "physically , this critical point represents the last point downstream in the outflow where the boundary conditions at the disk can communicate with and therefore affect the wind .",
    "an example of such a solution is shown by the dashed line in figure  [ parkerwindsolns ] , which threads the critical point , indicated by the circle .",
    "other solutions ( such as the `` breeze '' solutions that have @xmath27 below the position of the critical point in fig .",
    "[ parkerwindsolns ] , achieving smaller peak velocities than the critical point velocity and then decelerating ) that do not result in a viable outflow are also shown .",
    "second , in order to pass through that critical point , there is a further constraint on the temperature structure of the outflow , which was mentioned briefly above . in order for the solution to pass through the critical point and",
    "continuously accelerate , the temperature profile , @xmath28 must decrease with radius less quickly than @xmath16 .",
    "to show this , we recast the parker wind equation into a form that shows directly the comparison between the pressure gradient and gravity : @xmath29 this equation is simply a more general form ( not assuming isothermality ) of equation  [ dvdreq ] which will allow us to investigate non - isothermal wind models .",
    "the same conditions that applied to the numerator of equation  [ dvdreq ] apply to the right - hand side of equation  [ compareeq ] : namely , it will also have to transition from negative to positive values at the critical point .",
    "now , instead of assuming an isothermal wind ( as in eq .",
    "[ dvdreq ] ) , here we set @xmath30 , but retain the assumption of a central point mass , @xmath11 . after substituting this into equation  [ compareeq ] and simplifying ,",
    "we find : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sound speed at the base of the wind .",
    "one can see that in order for the pressure term to dominate gravity , @xmath33 must be greater than -1 . to illustrate this , consider the case of @xmath34 in equation  [ alphacompare ] : @xmath35 at the base of the wind , the right - hand side of the equation will read @xmath36 . since , at the base of a parker wind , @xmath37 , this term will be negative at the base of the wind , and since both the pressure gradient term ( the first term on the right - hand side ) and the gravitational term decrease as @xmath38 , the right - hand side of the equation will never be positive . in that case",
    ", the wind will not accelerate to escape velocity .",
    "therefore , in order for the wind to accelerate in this case ( where @xmath11 is constant with radius ) , @xmath33 must be greater then -1 .",
    "one can derive the same result another way : if @xmath39 , the result is a static atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for large - scale winds ( @xmath40  pc ) in agns , though , @xmath7 increases with radius .",
    "including the possibility of a spatially - varying @xmath7 in our requirement on the temperature profile @xmath28 , above , @xmath41 must decrease less quickly than @xmath16 in order to accelerate the wind to large distances .",
    "assuming an isothermal sphere to model the gravitational potential of the circumnuclear matter , we will find that ( for ngc  4151 ) the black hole stops dominating the gravitational potential at approximately 1  pc . beyond that distance , @xmath42 . in this regime",
    ", assuming a simple @xmath43 for now , equation  [ alphacompare ] becomes : @xmath44 equation  [ varymcompare ] then shows that we must have @xmath45 in order to get large - scale acceleration in a thermal wind .",
    "in other words , the wind must have @xmath28 at least slightly increasing with radius in order for a parker wind to accelerate .    in order to check this constraint on @xmath28",
    ", we must ensure that we address all of the heating and cooling components in an agn wind accurately . in  [ sed ] , we will use cloudy ( version 05.07.06 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to simulate the photoionization heating , although cloudy by itself can not include the effects of adiabatic cooling in the context of our thermal wind and wind geometry ( it can calculate adiabatic cooling in the context of its own internal wind models , however ) .",
    "this important cooling source will be considered next .",
    "we will run photoionization simulations at regular positions along the flow , but those separate photoionization simulations will not have any knowledge about the kinematics of the outflow .",
    "this would problematic for these large - scale flows where adiabatic cooling is important ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we calculate the magnitude of the adiabatic cooling outside of cloudy and include it as input to cloudy . the adiabatic cooling",
    "is simply calculated from : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the heat per unit mass , @xmath48 is the internal energy per unit mass , and @xmath49 is the work per unit mass done by the expanding gas .",
    "after some algebra , the change in internal energy is given by : @xmath50 finally , using @xmath51 to eliminate @xmath52 from the above expression , we find that the adiabatic cooling is given by : @xmath53 where @xmath52 is the mass density of the outflow , @xmath54 is the speed of sound , @xmath20 is the radial velocity , @xmath17 is the distance from the central source , and @xmath55 is the acceleration in the wind .",
    "this particular expression and the above - noted units are those necessary to supply the correct cooling rate to cloudy ; as such , the units on this expression are different from , e.g. , @xcite .    for all of the wind solutions found in this work , @xmath56 is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath57 , so the @xmath56 term is safely neglected .",
    "we will model the [ o  iii ]  emission as coming from clouds injected into the wind and accelerated by the ram pressure of the wind on those clouds .",
    "the drag force for each individual cloud is computed via ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass density of the wind , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the velocity of the wind and clouds , and @xmath62 represents the cross sectional area of a cloud . assuming a spherical cloud with mass @xmath63 , the acceleration for each cloud is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of an individual cloud .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 is a free parameter in our models .",
    "we use this parameter for all clouds , although it would be more physically plausible to imagine a range of densities for the clouds intercepting the large - scale thermal wind .",
    "this would lead to a range of velocities , which might explain the large ( @xmath67  km  s@xmath4 ) [ o  iii ]  line widths observed in this object @xcite and seen in many agns @xcite .",
    "the model presented here solely addresses trends in the observed centroid of the lines , however , and so only a single density ratio is used .",
    "we assume that the drag of the clouds on the wind is negligible compared to the acceleration of the parker wind .",
    "the wind is decelerated in much the same way that the clouds are accelerated : ram pressure from the impact on an external medium , which we assume is also broken up into clouds , and is also assumed stationary . much like before , then , the drag force is given by : @xmath68    as the wind decelerates , the embedded clouds decelerate as well , as @xmath69 becomes smaller than @xmath61 in the cloud drag equation , eq.[clouddrageq ] .",
    "again , @xmath70 is a free parameters in the models we run .",
    "the wind decelerates under this drag force until the wind becomes subsonic , at which point the integration of the equations of motion ceases .",
    "however , @xmath71 at such large distances that it does not affect our ability to fit the observed kinematics .",
    "the discussion in  [ parkerwindmodel ] outlined the basic physics of the parker wind .",
    "next , the inputs to that model must be defined from the observations of , in this case , ngc  4151 .",
    "most importantly for the consideration of heating , the central spectral energy distribution must be realistically modeled (  [ sed ] ) and the particular @xmath7 profile for ngc  4151 must be included (  [ mvsr ] ) .",
    "an accurate central spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is very important to understanding the heating and subsequent acceleration of parker winds in ngc  4151 . to model the sed",
    ", we use the central continuum of this object as modeled by @xcite ; this continuum is then used as input for the cloudy photoionization simulations .",
    "the continuum has two components : an intrinsic sed and absorption from surrounding gas .",
    "the specification for the intrinsic , unabsorbed sed is given in table  [ sedparams ] : the first and last values of @xmath33 in the table are relatively unimportant , and are specified simply to cut the spectrum off at low and high energies , while the intermediate values of @xmath33 are from @xcite . to this simple power law continuum",
    ", we add absorption via an x - ray warm absorber and uv absorber ( components  x - high  and  dea  from * ? ? ?",
    "the `` x - high '' absorber has a total hydrogen column density of @xmath72  @xmath73 and an ionization parameter of @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the ionizing luminosity for @xmath76  ev ) , while the `` dea '' absorber has a total hydrogen column of @xmath77  @xmath73 with @xmath78 ( using the column for the  northeast  absorber from * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , if clouds were created from thermal instabilities in within the wind , they would share the velocity of the wind ; the thermal wind itself accelerates too quickly to explain the slow acceleration of the [ o  iii]clouds , so cloud formation by thermal instability would not explain the observations .",

    "note that for the initial photoionization tests we present , the run of density vs. radius from the isothermal parker - wind model is used to set the density at each radius in the wind , so these models are not completely self - consistent .",
    "we will then conclude by testing an `` x - ray rich '' continuum to see if this can help explain the observations , and then finally we will test a non - isothermal parker wind ( with a photoionization - derived @xmath28 profile ) against the observations .      in order to look for a physically consistent thermal wind model that matches the earlier isothermal model and the observations , we ask ( 1 ) whether a roughly isothermal temperature structure can be achieved in an agn wind , ( 2 ) whether the temperature is high enough to roughly match the temperature required in the isothermal wind model , and ( 3 ) whether @xmath28 decreases less quickly than @xmath16 .    to answer the first two questions",
    ", we calculate the temperature as a function of radius for winds with a range of initial densities , @xmath182 , displayed in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] . the temperature vs. radius for each @xmath182",
    "is calculated by taking the @xmath183 profile from the isothermal wind model and running cloudy photoionization simulations at a range of radii given the central continuum of ngc  4151 ( defined in  [ sed ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that only for very large @xmath182 is the wind approximately isothermal .",
    "the only initial density in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] that leads to an approximately isothermal wind is @xmath184  @xmath128 .",
    "this density is so high that the resultant wind temperatures rise only to @xmath185  k. such a temperature is far too low to explain the observed velocities in ngc  4151 which required @xmath186  k. lower densities ( @xmath187 ) are also not possible in this model as @xmath28 always drops significantly at large distances .",
    "this is simply due to adiabatic cooling . with adiabatic cooling switched off",
    ", the temperature in the wind very quickly achieves @xmath188  k and remains at that constant temperature over the rest of the outflow .",
    "even with adiabatic cooling included , however , figure  [ temperaturestructure ] also shows that @xmath189  @xmath128 can achieve approximately the required temperatures over at least a limited range of radii in the outflow ; the drop in @xmath28 at larger distances shows that it may still be problematic , however .",
    "next , we focus on how quickly the temperature can change with radius and still allow a parker wind to form .",
    "figure  [ temperaturepowerlaw ] displays the exponent of a piecewise power law that fits the temperature profile shown in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] .",
    "again , in order for a physically consistent parker wind to exist in the core of ngc  4151 , @xmath28 must drop less slowly than @xmath181 for small distances ( @xmath92  pc ) , and then , where @xmath7 increases almost linearly with radius , @xmath28 must be , at least , approximately constant : it must have a power law index @xmath190 .",
    "this is true for the high density run with @xmath191  @xmath128 , but as already shown in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] , that wind does not have temperatures high enough to yield the observed velocities .",
    "the lower density trials meanwhile show extraordinarily large changes in @xmath192 with radius . for @xmath193  @xmath128 , @xmath28 drops below a power law index value of zero at @xmath194  pc .",
    "in contrast , acceleration of the _ isothermal _ parker wind must continue out to a few times the parker wind s critical point distance , which is at @xmath195  pc for the isothermal wind model shown in figure  [ cloudmodelbestfit ] ( non - isothermal wind models have critical points even further out , since much of the wind s acceleration occurs with @xmath196 ) .",
    "however , the temperature is already dropping precipitously at radii even smaller than @xmath197 for @xmath198  @xmath128 , so that range of densities would not yield a parker wind .",
    "the test case of @xmath199  @xmath128 is closer to having the required temperature ( at least at its maximum temperature ) , and is closer to the desired @xmath28 profile , and so more careful consideration is justified in this case . as shown in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] , this model does , if only in a limited range of radii , achieve approximately the temperature of the best - fitting isothermal model .",
    "figure  [ temperaturepowerlaw ] shows that the temperature does not drop appreciably until @xmath200  pc .",
    "we would expect that since acceleration in the wind is required out to a few parsecs , this temperature profile would also not lead to a viable parker wind model .",
    "but , as the temperature profile is close to satisfying the requirements on @xmath28 , we build a numerical parker wind model for generic @xmath28 from our photoionization simulations that finds , self - consistently , the critical point for that particular temperature law .",
    "applying this model to @xmath28 for the case of @xmath199  @xmath128 , we found that the wind decelerates beyond @xmath201  pc , and so would not fit the required @xmath202 profile .",
    "testing to see if this @xmath203  @xmath128 profile results in clouds velocities that might fit the data , we apply the same geometry and drag parameters as used in the previous best - fit model ( see table  [ cloudresults ] ) and present the model vs. the data from @xcite in figure  [ variabletr - n2e9 ] .",
    "the model clearly can not fit the observed velocities , or their variation with distance .",
    "if we instead use the @xmath28 profile derived from the @xmath204  @xmath128 wind model , we again find a wind that decelerates too quickly ( here , the wind starts decelerating at @xmath205  pc ) . attempting to fit this model to the data from @xcite results in a much better fit ( see figure  [ variabletr - n3e8 ] ) than in figure  [ variabletr - n2e9 ] , but still misses the high velocity data points shown in the figure . modifying the drag term in our wind equation does not improve the fit : decreasing the drag term to fit the higher - velocity points simply increases the outflow velocities , therefore doing an increasingly worse job of fitting the data points near @xmath206 . also ,",
    "modifying the geometry of the outflow has no significant impact on the fit : the half - angle of the bicone is already @xmath104 here ; increasing that to a maximum value of @xmath103 helps to include some of the higher velocity data points , but can not make up for the discrepancy relative to the isothermal model .",
    "still , this model represents the closest fit to the data achievable with a more realistic @xmath28 profile ; there is no quantitative way to distinguish this fit from the previous isothermal best - fit , but it is perhaps encouraging ; this model will be examined in more detail in  [ selfconsistanttr ] .",
    "unfortunately , all of the rest of the generic @xmath28 models can not come close to reproducing the data ( as can be seen , for example , in fig .",
    "[ variabletr - n2e9 ] ) .      up until this point ,",
    "we have used the @xmath183 profile from an isothermal parker wind model as input to a set of photoionization models , only rescaling the base density to test different initial densities .",
    "it is important to check if the fitting results improve with a more self - consistent @xmath28 , @xmath183 , and @xmath202 profile instead of using the isothermally - derived @xmath183 profile to calculate @xmath28 , as before .",
    "we test this possibility by examining the @xmath28 profile from the @xmath207 simulation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ temperaturestructure ] ) .",
    "this is then input into our non - isothermal parker wind model , and the resulting acceleration profile and @xmath183 profile is computed .",
    "this @xmath183 profile is then used as the basis for another iteration of cloudy simulations , to compute the resultant @xmath28 .",
    "we ask whether the result of this iteration on the @xmath28 structure will result in a temperature profile more suitable for a large - scale parker wind . however , the resulting @xmath28 profile only results in a worse fit to the data : the rise in the initial @xmath28 profile at @xmath208  pc causes the wind model to accelerate from the disk faster than the fiducial isothermal wind model .",
    "this increase in acceleration yields a wind that must be launched from larger radii ( @xmath209  pc instead of @xmath112  pc ) and also has a faster dropoff in density with height , which then yields a @xmath28 curve closer to the lower - density curves in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] : the self - consistent @xmath28 only results in a less isothermal wind model whose temperature decreases more quickly with radius beyond @xmath210  pc .",
    "therefore , attempting to include a self - consistent temperature profile in the parker wind model only results in a more rapidly increasing ( and then more rapidly decreasing ) @xmath28 profile , which results in a wind model that has a @xmath28 profile even less suited for accelerating a wind that might fit the observations of @xcite .",
    "so , in the end , including such a @xmath28 profile in the parker wind also can not explain the observed acceleration in ngc  4151 .",
    "to test the limits of our model of the central continuum , we now adopt a relatively x - ray - bright continuum to check if such a continuum would heat the gas to higher temperatures and modify our results . displayed in figure  [ altsed ] ,",
    "this continuum was primarily modified in the high - energy x - ray regime to more closely follow the observations of @xcite and the inferred high - energy spectrum of @xcite ; we continue to include the uv absorption , as before .",
    "this increase in x - ray brightness increases compton heating within the gas .",
    "meanwhile , the low - energy continuum in the sed has been significantly cut off below 1  ev in order to reduce compton cooling by low - energy photons as much as possible .",
    "this was done , for instance , in @xcite to account for the possibility that lower - energy photons are emitted at much larger scales and so might not act to cool the outflow in the immediate vicinity of the central black hole .",
    "( in reality , for the large - scale winds tested here , the question of the origin of the low - energy photons is less important since they almost certainly play a role on scales of 10  pc .",
    "however , to test the limits of the input continuum model , we attempt such a continuum anyway . )",
    "adopting this continuum does not greatly modify the compton temperature of the gas . the radiative equilibrium curve for this continuum is shown in figure  [ altequilcurve ] ; for this continuum , @xmath211  k as opposed to @xmath212  k for the original continuum .",
    "as one might infer from that relatively small change in the compton temperature of the gas , adopting this continuum for calculating @xmath28 does not result in significant changes to our results .",
    "we also calculated a self - consistent parker wind after inputing this continuum into our photoionization simulations , which yielded no appreciable difference from the tests with the original sed .",
    "overall , adopting this sed does not significantly alter any of our conclusions .",
    "an x - ray `` rich '' continuum for the central sed of ngc  4151 can not help a parker wind model to explain the observed velocity trends .",
    "we have developed models of parker winds accounting for the effects of the radially varying @xmath7 , adiabatic cooling , and drag effects between the wind and embedded clouds as well as drag forces between the wind and an external medium .",
    "we then tested these models against the conditions that exist in the center of one particular local agn , ngc  4151 .",
    "we have shown that simple thermal winds can not explain the slow acceleration that has been inferred for the nlr of ngc  4151 .",
    "the strongest constraint against self - consistent parker winds is that adiabatic cooling on the large scales of these outflows leads to temperatures in the wind that decreases strongly as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "with such a temperature profile , parker winds can not be launched and accelerated to the observed velocities at the observed distances .",
    "varying the initial density in the wind either yields temperatures that drop quickly with distance ( for @xmath213  @xmath128 ) or temperatures that are too low to reproduce the observed velocities ( @xmath214  @xmath128 ) .",
    "the intermediate case of @xmath215  @xmath128 comes closest to reproducing the data , yielding a temperature profile that we have checked by developing a numerical parker wind model for general @xmath28 .",
    "for the temperature profile shown in figure  [ temperaturestructure ] , the wind starts decelerating already at @xmath216  pc ; a radius much smaller than the 100  pc out to which acceleration is inferred in ngc  4151 .",
    "we find that plotting the resultant predicted @xmath202 against the data from @xcite shows that this wind model can not reproduce the range of [ o  iii ]  velocity points ( see fig .",
    "[ variabletr - n3e8 ] ) as well as the isothermal wind model ( which can not be obtained for ngc  4151 ) .",
    "further , attempting to develop a self - consistent @xmath28 profile for this wind results in a temperature profile even further from isothermal which correspondingly fails to fits the data .",
    "in short , we find no self - consistent @xmath28 profile for a large - scale parker wind that can explain the observed ranges of velocities .",
    "if thermal winds are not driving the observed @xmath202 profile , how can it be explained ?",
    "radiative driving is most likely not the source of the acceleration : we have tested simple models of radiative acceleration on dust , and such models achieve terminal velocities at distances of order the launch radius  much closer to the launch point than the observed velocity profiles .",
    "magnetic winds would also achieve their terminal velocities on similar scales ( although perhaps clouds dragged in the magnetic wind might yield the slow acceleration seen ) .",
    "the difficulty in fitting this data with almost any known wind model leads us to question whether the observed velocity law is actually a wind accelerating with radius .",
    "perhaps the observed kinematic profile is the result of an interaction of a wind with the surrounding medium .",
    "an interesting alternative interpretation is suggested in the work of @xcite , which showed that rather generic hydromagnetic winds , expanding into gas surrounding a young stellar object at the wind s terminal velocity , would yield @xmath5 , or a `` hubble law''-type flow .",
    "this is a promising theory for the accelerating portion of the outflow , but it seems unclear how the observed slow deceleration of the flow in ngc  4151 could then be explained in the same picture . still , it is important to point out that given the inability of a wide range of wind models to explain the observed @xmath202 profile , perhaps these observations are not revealing acceleration of a wind , but instead the interaction of an already accelerated wind with the surrounding medium .",

    "<S> we build and test parker - wind models to apply to observations of large - scale ( @xmath0pc ) outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> these models include detailed photoionization simulations , the observed radially varying mass profile , adiabatic cooling , and approximations for clouds dragged along in the wind and the interaction of the wind with the circumnuclear ism of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we test this model against recent _ hst_/stis observations of [ o  iii]emission - line kinematics ( in particular , we test against those observed in ngc  4151 , but approximately the same kinematics is observed in ngc  1068 and mrk  3 ) to constrain the viability of large - scale thermal winds in agns . </S>",
    "<S> we find that adiabatic cooling dominates in these outflows , decelerating parker winds on large scales , making them highly unlikely as explanations of the observed kinematics . </S>"
