    "the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration has recently presented an updated set of atmospheric neutrino data for a detector exposure of 79.5 kty @xcite .",
    "the corresponding statistics is about twice as large as compared to the one considered in our earlier published analysis of three - flavor mixing @xcite and of two - flavor mixing with nonstandard dynamics @xcite , and is about 12% larger than in our previous analysis of four - family schemes in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the chooz collaboration presented in @xcite final _ spectral _ data , which we now include in @xmath0 analyses @xcite , improving the accuracy of our previous results @xcite based on the chooz _ total rate _ @xcite .    therefore , we think it useful to present a concise update of our @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 oscillation studies , performed under the hypothesis of one mass - scale dominance , so as to elucidate the current status and implications of subdominant ( electron or sterile ) neutrino mixing in @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we also discuss a specific @xmath0 example which maximally violates the assumption of one - dominant mass scale .",
    "the standard @xmath1 case of @xmath4 oscillations can be parametrized by one squared mass difference between two states @xmath5 , @xmath6 and by one mixing angle @xmath7 , describing the flavor content of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure  1 shows our @xmath1 best fit to the latest sk data , reached at @xmath11 , and corresponding to @xmath12 for @xmath13 degrees of freedom  a very good fit . with respect to the @xmath1 ( subcase ) analysis presented in @xcite is mainly due to a better agreement of the latest sk electron distributions with their no - oscillation expectations ( especially in the multi - gev sample ) . ]",
    "the sk collaboration finds the @xmath14 minimum at a slightly different point , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , the difference is not statistically significant , since the @xmath14 function turns out to be rather flat around the minimum , and the `` distance '' between our best - fit point and the sk one is only about one unit in @xmath16 . concerning the @xmath1 bounds on @xmath17 from parameter estimation , they will be discussed later as limits of @xmath0 and @xmath2 cases .    the striking evidence in favor of standard @xmath4 oscillations ( fig .",
    "1 ) strongly constrains nonstandard explanations . by using the approach described in @xcite , we parametrize a wide class of scenarios involving nonstandard dynamics through three ( free ) parameters : an oscillation amplitude @xmath18 , an overall phase factor @xmath19 , and an energy exponent @xmath20 ,",
    "the standard mass - mixing dynamics being recovered for @xmath21 .",
    "figure  2 shows the results of such a three - parameter fit in terms of the projection @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding bounds on @xmath20 give @xmath23 at 90% c.l .",
    "( @xmath24 for three free parameters , @xmath25 ) , in perfect agreement with the standard case .",
    "such results strengthen our previous bounds obtained with smaller ( 45 kty ) sk statistics ( @xmath26 @xcite ) , and definitely exclude nonstandard dynamics with integer @xmath27 in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "oscillations of three neutrinos @xmath28 , under the hypothesis of one mass scale dominance for atmospheric @xmath29 s ( equivalent to set @xmath30 ) , are characterized by one squared mass difference , @xmath31 ( the cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 being physically different @xcite ) , and by two mixing angles ( @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 $ ] ) , describing the flavor content of the state @xmath36 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        pure @xmath4 case being recovered for @xmath38 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to show the bounds in the mixing parameter space",
    ", we used in @xcite a triangular representation @xcite , which is basically a linear mapping in the variables ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "such a representation has the advantage of embedding unitarity by construction , but has the disadvantage of not showing in detail the phenomenologically interesting case of small @xmath40 .",
    "we use here the alternative representation in terms of @xmath41 in logarithmic scale ( also introduced in @xcite ) , which expands the small @xmath40 region while preserving octant symmetry ( when applicable ) .",
    "using sk data only , and assuming @xmath32 , we find the best fit @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "the slight deviation of the best fit mixing from the pure @xmath4 maximal mixing [ @xmath44 , although intriguing .",
    "] , is  unfortunately  not statistically significant @xmath45 .",
    "this also implies that there is no significant indication for possible matter effects related to @xmath46 mixing @xmath47 in the sk data .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath0 volume allowed at 90% and 99% c.l .",
    "( @xmath48 and 11.36 for @xmath25 , respectively ) in the @xmath49 parameter space , through its projections onto the coordinate planes .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath50 ( @xmath51 at 90% c.l . ) improves the one found in @xcite ( @xmath52 at 90% c.l .  from 33 kty sk data ) , showing the steady progress of sk in confirming dominant @xmath4 mixing and in constraining additional @xmath46 mixing . the 90% c.l .",
    "range for @xmath53 is @xmath54@xmath55 ev@xmath56 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath57 in fig",
    ".  3 are octant - symmetric only in the @xmath1 limit @xmath58 ( as they should ) , and show a slight preference for @xmath7 in the second octant when @xmath59 .",
    "correspondingly , slightly higher values of @xmath53 are preferred .",
    "the ( weak ) positive correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath57 or @xmath53 , however , is largely suppressed by the inclusion of chooz data , as we now discuss .    as described in @xcite",
    ", we can now include the chooz reactor spectral data ( 14 bins minus one adjustable normalization parameter ) through a @xmath14 statistics reproducing the bounds of the so - called `` chooz analysis a '' @xcite .",
    "this improvement provides more accurate bounds in the @xmath53 region of interest for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "our best fit to sk+chooz data ( @xmath60 ) is reached at @xmath61 . once again , the small deviation of the best fit mixing from @xmath62 is not statistically significant ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the projections of the @xmath49 volume allowed by sk+chooz . by comparing fig .  3 with fig .  4 ,",
    "the tremendous impact of chooz on @xmath46 mixing bounds becomes evident ( one order of magnitude difference in the upper bound on @xmath50 ) .",
    "as expected , at the small values of @xmath50 allowed by the fit in fig .  4 ,",
    "both the octant - asymmetry in @xmath7 and the upper limit on @xmath53 are reduced , and the 90% c.l .",
    "range for @xmath53 becomes @xmath54@xmath64 ev@xmath56 .",
    "we have also repeated the fit for the case @xmath33 ( not shown ) , corresponding to a state @xmath36 lighter than @xmath65 . for negative @xmath53",
    ", we get somewhat weaker bounds on @xmath50 ( @xmath66 at 90% c.l . ) for the fit to sk data only , while the fit to sk+chooz data gives results almost identical to those in fig .  4 .",
    "this fact shows that , unfortunately , current atmospheric+reactor data are basically unable to discriminate the sign of @xmath53 in @xmath0 scenarios , as it was the case for pre - sk and pre - chooz data @xcite",
    ".    finally , fig .",
    "5 shows the sk zenith distributions computed for three representative cases at @xmath67 ( allowed at 90% c.l .  by sk+chooz ) and for @xmath7 both maximal ( @xmath68 ) and nonmaximal ( @xmath69 and 2 ) . within statistical errors , the @xmath0 zenith distributions in fig .",
    "5 are hardly distinguishable from the @xmath1 one in fig .  1 ( even more so for @xmath33 , not shown ) , the differences being at most @xmath70 in a few bins .",
    "therefore , there is little hope to unambiguously discover @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath46 mixing ) from sk atmospheric data in the near future .",
    "we consider the @xmath2 ( 3 active + 1 sterile ) scenario described in @xcite , characterized by a 2 + 2 mass spectrum with well - separated atmospheric and solar doublets .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption @xcite that the atmospheric doublet @xmath72 is almost decoupled from @xmath46 , and that the solar doublet @xmath5 is almost decoupled from @xmath73 .",
    "the dominant mass scale for atmospheric neutrinos is then @xmath74 and two mixing angles ( @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath75 $ ] ) are sufficient to describe the flavor contents of the state @xmath76 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }         @xmath4 and @xmath78 cases being recovered for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . in such scenario , the cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not physically different ( being equivalent under octant inversion , @xmath81 @xcite ) , and we take @xmath32 .",
    "figure  6 shows the bounds obtained by a fit to sk data at 90% and 99% c.l.(@xmath25 ) in the parameter space @xmath82 .",
    "the best fit point @xmath42 is reached at @xmath83 but , once again , the preferred mixing differs from @xmath62 by less than one unit in @xmath84 .",
    "notice that in the @xmath85 plane , the @xmath2 projected bounds of fig .  6 are very similar to the @xmath0 ones in fig .  4 , implying that the current limits on the `` @xmath1 '' subset of parameters @xmath85 are rather stable even by making allowance for additional @xmath86 or @xmath46 mixing .    concerning the @xmath87 plane in fig",
    "6 , the upper bounds on @xmath88 indicate that pure @xmath78 oscillations @xmath89 are disfavored as compared with pure @xmath4 oscillations @xmath90 , in agreement with @xcite , although large @xmath86 mixing is not excluded yet . in particular , the current upper limit from fig .",
    "6 ( @xmath91 at 90% c.l . ) is even slightly _ weaker _ than the one we found with smaller statistics in @xcite ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the reason can be traced to a peculiar feature of the latest up@xmath93 data , namely , the flatness of the muon suppression pattern in the four up@xmath93 bins at @xmath94 $ ] , as described in fig .",
    "figure  7 shows the sk zenith distributions for three representative @xmath2 cases with sizable @xmath86 mixing ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "as it is well known ( and evident from a comparison of fig .  7 with fig .  1 ) , additional @xmath86 mixing for atmospheric neutrinos tends to reduce the muon suppression and , in particular , tends to flatten the normalized up@xmath93 distribution . although the sk up@xmath93 data do prefer a mean positive slope rather than a flat suppression , the four bins in the zenith range @xmath94 $ ] happen to favor a locally flat distribution",
    ". this current feature might be just a statistical fluctuation but , at present , it plays some role in global fits , where it tends to weaken the rejection of `` flat '' distributions ( i.e. , of sizable @xmath86 mixing ) , as compared with previous up@xmath93 data @xcite .",
    "the sk collaboration has also presented additional ( preliminary ) indication in favor of @xmath4 mixing coming from statistical @xmath96 appearance in selected event samples @xcite .",
    "it seems possible to isolate an excess of about @xmath97 @xmath98-like events , to be compared with standard @xmath4 expectations of @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , such numbers imply an additional @xmath100 evidence ( @xmath101 ) in favor of pure @xmath4 ( @xmath102 ) as compared with pure @xmath78 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we have then roughly parametrized the sk `` tau appearance '' signal by adding a penalty function @xmath104 in the @xmath2 fit .",
    "we get an `` improved '' upper bound @xmath105 at 90% c.l .  ( @xmath25 ) , to be compared with @xmath91 in fig .",
    "6 ( without penalty function ) . on the one hand",
    ", this seems to indicate that there is certainly room to refine current bounds on additional @xmath86 mixing in sk ; on the other hand , our analysis shows that large @xmath86 mixing ( e.g. , a fifty - fifty admixture of @xmath96 and @xmath86 at @xmath106 ) is not yet excluded at present .",
    "therefore , compatibility with complementary solar neutrino bounds on @xmath88 @xcite is still possible , as it was the case for previous sk data @xcite .",
    "the bounds on dominant and subdominant mixing found in the previous sections can be conveniently summarized in one single plot , as shown in fig .",
    "the left panel shows the bounds on the @xmath85 parameters for pure @xmath4 mixing ( equivalent to our @xmath0 scheme for @xmath107 or to our @xmath2 scheme for @xmath108 ) . as discussed before ,",
    "such bounds are not significantly altered by additional @xmath46 mixing ( @xmath59 ) or by additional @xmath86 mixing ( @xmath109 ) , and thus they hold also in the global @xmath0 and @xmath2 fits with good accuracy . for such reason , the @xmath1 bounds in the left panel are formally obtained for @xmath110 , so as to match those in the middle and right panels .",
    "the middle panel shows the @xmath0 bounds on additional @xmath46 mixing ( @xmath59 ) , with and without chooz .",
    "finally , the left panel shows the @xmath2 bounds on additional @xmath86 mixing ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "such synthetic figure represents the main result of our analysis .",
    "the analyses in the previous sections are based on the assumption that atmospheric neutrino oscillations are driven by only one mass scale @xmath111 .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , especially if one takes the `` solar '' squared mass difference in the upper range allowed by the data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , provided that one accepts an averaged or quasiaveraged solar neutrino survival probability @xcite . concerning atmospheric neutrinos , two mass scales in the range @xmath112 ev@xmath56",
    "were shown to provide acceptable fits to previous sk+chooz data @xcite . here",
    "we show , through a specific example , that such possibility is not yet excluded by the latest data .",
    "let us consider the specific @xmath0 case shown in fig .",
    "9 , characterized by two equal squared mass differences ( @xmath113 ) ev@xmath56 , and by mixing angles , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . ]",
    "@xmath116 , giving the flavor composition of mass eigenstates shown in the same figure .",
    "the spectrum in fig .",
    "9 might be called `` democratic '' , since it maximally violates the usual `` hierarchical '' approximation ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath46 oscillations are driven only by @xmath118 , which is purposely chosen just below the current chooz bounds @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino survival probability is then @xmath119 , up to small ( quasiaveraged @xcite ) corrections .",
    "figure  10 shows the sk zenith distributions computed for the democratic scenario in fig .  9 , and corresponding to @xmath120 for the fit to sk data only ( @xmath121 if chooz data are also included ) .",
    "although such value is significantly higher than in the best - fit @xmath1 case of fig .",
    "1 , it is still acceptable from the point of view of goodness of fit .",
    "all in all , the curves in fig .",
    "10 provide a globally acceptable `` fit - by - eye '' , with moderate departures from the data along the horizontal direction ( @xmath122 ) for the mg@xmath93 and us@xmath93 samples .",
    "therefore , if one accepts an almost constant @xmath123 suppression as explanation of the solar neutrino deficit , @xmath0 scenarios with two comparable mass scales appear to represent a viable possibility in the current atmospheric neutrino phenomenology .",
    "needless to say , the most general analysis of such cases ( depending on all the @xmath0 mass - mixing parameters ) would be rather intricated , and is postponed to a future work .",
    "in the context of the latest ( 79.5 kty ) sk atmospheric @xmath29 data , we have concisely reviewed the status of dominant @xmath4 oscillations ( including the case of nonstandard dynamics , fig .  2 ) and of subdominant @xmath46 and @xmath86 mixing ( in @xmath0 and @xmath2 schemes , respectively ) .",
    "in the @xmath0 case we have applied an improved chooz analysis .",
    "the main @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 results are discussed separately and then summarized in fig .",
    "finally , we have shown ( through a specific example ) that current atmospheric neutrino data are also compatible with oscillations driven by two comparable mass scales .",
