    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are the bubbles inflated by the relativistic winds of neutron stars as they interact with their surroundings .",
    "their radio to x - ray emission is believed to result from synchrotron radiation of the high - energy particles injected by a rotation - powered neutron star in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "as such , pwne represent an ideal laboratory to study the physics of neutron stars and particle acceleration .",
    "they are also good indicators for the presence of an active rotation - powered pulsar ; see  @xcite for a detailed review on the structure and evolution of pwne . while the crab nebula has been viewed to represent the prototype pwn , a growing list of pwne show properties unlike the crab : namely , different spectral properties ( spectral index , spectral break in the radio ) and different morphology .",
    "these are referred to in the literature as `` plerions of the second kind '' or non - crab - like plerions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a class that we have been targeting with combined radio and x - ray studies ; see  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "this paper addresses , using x - ray observations , the nature of ctb  87 ; the least studied object ( at least in x - rays ) among this growing class of pwne . in a subsequent paper ( kothes et al . in preparation ) , we present a dedicated study of the remnant at radio wavelengths .    ctb  87 ( g74.9 + 1.2)@xmath10 has been classified as a plerionic type snr based on its centrally - filled morphology , lack of evidence of a shell , and linearly polarized radio flux  @xcite . in the radio ,",
    "ctb  87 has a size of 8@xmath36  and a flux density of 9  jy at 1  ghz  @xcite .",
    "early x - ray observations with the _ einstein _ satellite also identified ctb  87 as a plerionic snr , with an x - ray luminosity nearly 100 times weaker than the crab nebula in the @xmath11  kev band  @xcite .",
    "newer sensitive radio studies indicated that the central bright structure has a relatively steep radio spectrum , with a spectral index @xmath12 = 0.5 ( @xmath13 ) , which is unusual for a plerionic snr .",
    "in addition , larger diffuse emission , @xmath016  in size , has been identified and characterized by a much flatter spectrum which is more consistent of a plerionic snr ( kothes et al .",
    "2003 ; kothes et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that ctb  87 is located in the cygnus arm , and detected a very faint optical shell with 20  diameter in the vicinity of ctb  87 .",
    "this optical shell has not been however confirmed and the author concludes that the small amount of data prevents them from drawing a firm conclusion .",
    "locating ctb  87 in the cygnus arm puts the remnant at a much smaller distance than that estimated using hi data from the canadian galactic plane survey ( @xmath14  kpc ,  @xcite ) , a distance that implies a location within the perseus spiral arm .",
    "egret _ source has been suggested to be possibly associated with ctb  87 , although  @xcite argued that the snr is too weak and far away ( using an old distance estimate of 12  kpc ) to be the most likely candidate .",
    "the revised kinematic distance to ctb  87 of 6.1  kpc weakened this argument , further increasing interest in ctb  87 as a potential @xmath15-ray source .",
    "other @xmath15-ray studies of the area near ctb  87 with _ milagro",
    "_ led to the detection of an unresolved source , mgro  j2019 + 37  @xcite , which was further studied and resolved with _",
    "veritas_. the _ veritas _ source , ver  j2016 + 372 , showed an absence of variability throughout the observations and a spectrum similar to other pwne previously detected in the vhe band  @xcite .",
    "finally , _ fermi _ detected a high - energy source , 2fgl  2015.6 + 3709 , which was found to be likely variable and therefore a physical association with ctb  87 was deemed improbable  @xcite .",

    ", this corresponds to a distance of 0.15  pc from the point source .",
    "this estimate is in agreement with the typical scale of 0.1  pc observed in other pwne  @xcite . using the spin - down energy inferred above , and equating the expression of the termination shock site to 5",
    ", we estimate the pressure in the pwn to be @xmath73  dyne  @xmath5 .",

    "this estimate is in agreement with the preliminary value inferred from the radio study assuming equipartition between particle energy and magnetic field energy ( kothes et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the absence of a snr shell detection implies expansion into a low - density medium . to infer the upper limit on the density of the medium that the pulsar wind nebula is expanding into ( which would be the shocked ejecta for a vela - like snr ) , we estimate next the maximum thermal contribution to the diffuse emission allowed by the data by adding a thermal component to the power law model .",
    "we freeze the best fit power law parameters ( table  [ table : spectra ] , ` total diffuse ' region ) , and add an astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) thermal component  @xcite .",
    "we increase the emission measure ( @xmath75 ) until the model level under 1  kev exceeds the data by 2@xmath17 , finding a conservative upper limit for the normalization on the thermal component of 9  @xmath3  10@xmath76  @xmath77 ( for @xmath32  =  0.5  kev ) .",

    "if a snr shell exists beyond the detected pwn , the shocked ism must have a density lower than that estimated above for the ejecta , @xmath90  @xmath9 = @xmath91  @xmath9 ( for a volume filling factor @xmath92 ) .",
    "this then implies an upper limit on the upstream ambient density of @xmath8  @xmath9 ( @xmath93  g  @xmath9 where @xmath94 includes only hydrogen ) , assuming a compression ratio of 4 .",
    "the inferred low density supports the lack of detection of the snr shell or x - ray emitting ejecta , and is suggestive of expansion into a stellar wind - blown bubble @xcite .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with estimates obtained by extracting the background spectrum ( outside the pwn ) and assuming that the thermal emission from a putative shell is buried underneath the background . from these background spectra",
    ", we estimate an upper limit of @xmath95  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath7  arcmin@xmath96 on the observed x - ray flux of the putative snr shell .",
    "the above density upper limit is similar to density estimates for g21.5 - 0.9  @xcite , whose shell was revealed after accumulating @xmath00.5  msec using _",
    "chandra_. a deep x - ray observation of ctb  87 to search for the missing snr shell is therefore warranted .",
    "additionally , future studies of the surrounding environment with co or hi data may help to further constrain the density .",
    "this scenario will be revisited and further discussed in the follow - up radio paper ( kothes et al . in preparation ) .",
    "assuming that the remnant is evolving in a uniform medium , the reverse shock will reach the center of the snr in a time @xmath97  kyr .",
    "for an ejected mass of a few solar masses , an explosion energy of @xmath98  ergs , and a number density of @xmath99  @xmath9 , this is greater than 4  kyr for ctb  87 , consistent with our estimate above for the age ( see section 5.1 ) .    for a remnant in the sedov stage ,",
    "the snr radius can be estimated as @xmath100  @xcite . again assuming an explosion energy of @xmath101  erg , an ism density of @xmath102  @xmath9 , and an age of @xmath45  kyr ( large uncertainty noted in section  [ section : age ] )",
    ", we estimate the snr radius to be @xmath103  pc , which is larger than the revised size of the pwn ( @xmath028  pc diameter at 6.1  kpc ; see section 5.1 ) .",
    "we conclude that all of the above mentioned arguments point to ctb  87 being an evolved pwn expanding into a low density medium , likely due to the stellar wind bubble blown by the progenitor star .",
    "in section 5.2 we have interpreted the compact @xmath05  nebula shown in figure  2 as a wind - blown bubble associated with the deposition of the neutron star s wind energy into the surroundings . as shown in figure  1 , in addition to this compact nebula , the x - ray emission from ctb  87 is characterized by a cometary - like structure extending @xmath0250   northwest from cxou  j201609.2 + 371110 and bridging the x - ray and radio emission peaks .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this extended emission has some brightening along its edges ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this morphology may be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , these arcs may be a bow shock structure due to the motion of the pulsar to the southeast through the snr interior , leading to the formation of a pwn with a hybrid morphology ( i.e. a wind - blown bubble and a bow shock nebula ) .",
    "alternatively , the reverse snr shock may be running into , and crushing , the pwn .",
    "we discuss next these two scenarios .      a pulsar given a kick at birth that has sufficient velocity will move out of the pwn and create a bow shock . as the pulsar moves outward in the snr , away from the supernova explosion site , the sound speed in the shocked ejecta decreases and the pulsar s motion becomes supersonic .",
    "the ram - pressure from the pulsar s motion confines the nebula and the pwn evolves to a cometary appearance , with the bow shock forming around the head of the pwn after the pulsar has crossed @xmath068% of the snr shell , at half of the crossing time  @xcite .",
    "the pulsar wind in a bow shock pwn decelerates at a termination shock where the pressure balance is due to ram pressure from the neutron star s motion . in the direction of the star s motion ,",
    "the termination shock radius , @xmath104 , is defined by @xmath105 ( @xmath106 for an isotropic wind ) , and is located at approximately half of the observed bow shock radius  @xcite .",
    "ram - pressure confinement in this hybrid morphology scenario requires that the ram pressure due to the pulsar s proper motion in the snr environment , @xmath107 , exceeds the nebular pressure , @xmath108 , estimated in section  5.2 ( @xmath109 is the density of the medium in which the psr is moving ) . assuming that the brightening along the pwn edge in figure  [ figure : pwn ] is due to a bow shock , @xmath110  cm . using our inferred value for @xmath111 ( section 5.2 )",
    ", we find that @xmath112  dyne  @xmath5 .",
    "this is only @xmath07% of the pressure @xmath113  dyne  @xmath5 estimated from the termination shock of the more compact nebula ( section  5.2 ) , a ratio that is consistent with @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath107 to exceed this nebular pressure of @xmath010@xmath115  dyne  @xmath5 , @xmath116 should exceed @xmath0170  km  s@xmath7 ( for an assumed ambient density of 0.2  @xmath9 , section 5.3 ) . as the formation of a prominent bow shock requires the nebular pressure to be exceeded by a large amount , the above suggests a high pulsar velocity",
    "is needed for creation of a bow shock and argues against the cometary morphology being caused by ram - pressure confinement .      in the following ,",
    "we discuss the observed morphology in the light of an evolved pwn encountering the snr reverse shock .",
    "this is motivated by the age inferred above ( section  5.1 ) and the offset observed between the radio and x - ray nebulae , as seen in other evolved pwne further described below .",
    "a detailed description of the evolution of a pwn in a snr can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we here briefly summarize .",
    "as the expanding snr sweeps up sufficient mass from the ism , it evolves into a sedov - taylor phase . a reverse shock develops , running back into the supernova ejecta and eventually crushing the pwn , causing it to rebound and oscillate several times .",
    "the timescale for the reverse shock to interact with the entire pwn is a significant fraction of the pwn life  @xcite .",
    "after these oscillations fade , the pwn again expands , now into hot , shocked ejecta .",
    "the pulsar may have traveled a distance comparable or larger than the equivalent spherical pwn around a stationary pulsar .",
    "the pulsar leaves its original wind bubble and generates a new smaller pwn at its current location , off - center within the pwn .",
    "therefore , after the passage of the reverse shock the pwn consists of ( i ) a _ relic _ pwn from the initial energetic stage of the pulsar wind , appearing as a central ( possibly distorted ) radio pwn with little corresponding x - ray emission , and ( ii ) a head containing the pulsar , directed toward the snr shell , and emitting in x - rays .",
    "express an upper limit on the age , @xmath117 , at which the reverse shock collides with the entire pwn surface as @xmath118  yr where @xmath119 is the total mechanical energy of the snr in units of @xmath98  erg , @xmath120 is the ejected mass , and @xmath94 is the ambient hydrogen number density . for ctb  87",
    "we assume ( as above ) the explosion energy is @xmath98  erg , that the ejected mass is a few solar masses , and that the ambient density is @xmath220.2  @xmath9 .",
    "we find that @xmath121  kyr for ctb  87 , at the low end of the estimated age ( section  5.1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the reverse shock has potentially encountered the pwn , and is the cause of the observed morphology .",
    "the supernova explosion may also have been asymmetric , or the ambient density may be non - uniform , leading to a more rapid evolution in one direction .",
    "this is to be further discussed in the forthcoming radio paper ( kothes et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the tev emission detected from ctb  87  @xcite .",
    "focusing on _ chandra_-detected pwne near extended tev sources , @xcite find that faint extensions of compact pwne point toward offset centers of tev emission , supporting the notion that these tev sources are crushed pwne .",
    "recent _ veritas _ studies of ctb  87 indicate that the tev emission overlaps with the radio emission , further supporting the picture of a ` relic ' pwn ( e. aliu and m. roberts 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission from the snr ejecta or snr shell remains however a question to be addressed with deeper observations .",
    "g327.1@xmath11.1 is a composite remnant with a symmetric radio shell and off - center non - thermal component ( pwn ) , similar in structure to ctb  87 .",
    "there is a radio finger extending from the pwn , at the end of which is a compact x - ray source that may be the pulsar  @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _  images show a compact source embedded in a cometary structure that trails back toward the radio pwn , as well as two prong - like structures extending into a large bubble in the opposite direction from the pwn  @xcite .",
    "we see a similar structure in ctb  87 ( figure 1 ) with the x - ray nebula offset from the radio nebula and most of the x - ray nebula trailing back toward the radio nebula .",
    "we also see emission ahead of the point source in ctb  87 , extending to the southeast away from the radio nebula .",
    "@xcite similarly favor a reverse shock interaction scenario over a bow shock scenario .",

    "xmm - newton_. the snr shell detection in g327.1@xmath11.1 also allows further constraints to be placed on the snr properties .",
    "tev emission from g327.1@xmath11.1 has been detected by _",
    "_ , showing the @xmath15-ray centroid is located between the radio centroid and the pulsar candidate  @xcite .",
    "vela - x ( associated with psr  b0833 - 45 ) is another example of a pwn whose morphology has been affected by its interaction with the reverse shock ( blondin et al .",
    "the radio nebula extends south of the pulsar , the northern portion possibly having been disturbed by the reverse shock .",
    "vela - x has a complicated filamentary structure in x - rays , with thermal emission and enhanced o , ne , and mg abundances detected , signifying ejecta that has been mixed into the nebula by the propagation of the reverse shock  @xcite .",
    "the explanation of vela - x as a relic pwn was confirmed by @xcite with the detection of tev emission that is offset from the pulsar .",
    "we have presented the first detailed x - ray study of ctb  87 , a large radio nebula classified as a pwn .",
    "thanks to _ chandra _ s unprecedented resolution , we have detected a point source , cxou  j201609.2 + 371110 , the likely putative pulsar powering ctb  87 , inside a compact x - ray nebula that is @xmath0100  offset from the peak of the radio nebula .",
    "the compact @xmath05-radius nebula is characterized by a torus / jet - like structure indicating its origin as the putative pulsar s wind - blown bubble .",
    "in addition to the x - ray source and compact nebula , a more extended nebula was found to trail back toward the peak of the radio emission .",
    "a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the nebula shows that the pwn is well fit by a power law model , with the overall spectrum steepening away from the point source .",
    "we also observed brightening at the edges of the pwn , and discussed two possible interpretations : a bow shock caused by the motion of the pulsar or a pwn crushed by the snr s reverse shock . based on the observed multi - wavelength morphology , timescale for the reverse shock to interact with the pwn , and estimated age of the pwn",
    ", the reverse shock interaction scenario seems more plausible .",
    "a deep x - ray observation is needed to search for thermal emission associated with the shocked ejecta and/or the snr shell , as well as to confirm the high - resolution structures detected in the compact nebula . timing studies in the radio and x - ray",
    "will allow the search for pulsations from cxou  j201609.2 + 371110 .",

    "<S> we find that the peak of the x - ray emission is clearly offset from the peak of the radio emission by @xmath0100  and located at the southeastern edge of the radio nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a point source - the putative pulsar - at the peak of the x - ray emission and study its spectrum separately from the pwn . </S>",
    "<S> this new point source , cxou  j201609.2 + 371110 , is surrounded by a compact nebula displaying a torus - like structure and possibly a jet . </S>",
    "<S> a more extended diffuse nebula is offset from the radio nebula , extending from the point source to the northwest for @xmath0250 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the point source , compact nebula and extended diffuse nebula are all well described by a power law model with a photon index of 1.1 ( 0.7@xmath11.6 ) , 1.2 ( 0.9@xmath11.4 ) and 1.7 ( 1.5@xmath11.8 ) , respectively , for a column density @xmath2  =  1.38 ( 1.21@xmath11.57 )  @xmath3  10@xmath4  @xmath5 ( 90% confidence ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total x - ray luminosity of the source is @xmath01.6  @xmath3  10@xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 at an assumed distance of 6.1  kpc , with @xmath0 2% and 6% contribution from the point source and compact nebula , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the observed properties suggest that ctb  87 is an evolved ( @xmath05@xmath128  kyr ) pwn , with the extended radio emission likely a ` relic ' pwn , as in vela - x and g327.1@xmath11.1 . to date , however , there is no evidence for thermal x - ray emission from this snr , and the snr shell is still missing , suggesting expansion into a low - density medium ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , likely caused by a stellar wind bubble blown by the progenitor star . </S>"
