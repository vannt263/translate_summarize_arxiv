    "usually they are labelled as gels if the particle density is low and as glasses if the density is large .",
    "however , the difference between these two states is at present not very well understood and therefore it is not always easy to distinguish them . despite this difficulty quite a few features in this glass - gel cross - cover regime have been studied extensively .    in dense glass forming liquids",
    "the slowing down of dynamics is related to the mutual steric - hindrance in the motion of the constituent particles .",
    "the dynamical properties of these glass formers are characterized by a stretched - exponential shape of relaxation functions @xcite , or similarly by the anomalous , exponential tails in the van hove distributions of particle displacements @xcite .",
    "many of these dynamical features are described well by mode - coupling theory @xcite . at even lower temperatures ,",
    "the relaxation dynamics can be understood by means of the random first order transition theory @xcite . in these glass formers ,",
    "the structure is usually close - packed for hard sphere or van der waals type interactions and is accompanied by a super - arrhenius increase of viscosity . or , if there are covalent bondings , they form network - like structures and exhibit an arrhenius increase in viscosity .    on the other hand ,",
    "chemical gels or rubbers are soft solids having random network structures @xcite .",
    "the cross linking of the permanent bonds between the constituent monomers happens during the synthesis process inducing a vulcanization transition once the density of the links exceeds the percolation threshold  @xcite .",
    "different static and dynamical properties in the vicinity of this transition have been studied , both using simulations and theoretical models ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "physical gels are on the other hand low - density network structures with bonds that can be broken / realigned by thermal fluctuations within finite timescales  @xcite .",
    "one possible nonequilibrium path to physical gelation is via a thermal quench across the liquid - gas spinodal leading to dynamically arrested states @xcite , that show complex aging phenomena @xcite . in general , these paths lead to spatially heterogeneous structures .",
    "however , in recent times , considerable effort has been made to devise ways by which spatially homogeneous physical gels can be formed @xcite . for such gel - forming systems , a wide variety of relaxation functions have been reported : logarithmic @xcite , stretched @xcite or compressed exponentials @xcite . while theoretical models @xcite have been proposed to account for such dynamical properties , they are at this time certainly not yet comprehensive",
    ".    of particular interest is the interplay between these different arrest mechanisms , viz",
    ". gel and glass , since their competition can be used to engineer materials with novel functionalities @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been carried out in systems with competing lengthscales @xcite or interactions @xcite . yet",
    ", only few models do allow to study the low density gel phase and high density glass at the same time .",
    "accessing this regime is , however , necessary for investigating the structure and dynamics at those intermediate densities where the gel transforms into a glass and vice versa . here",
    ", we study a simple model with direct experimental relevance @xcite , and which permits us to traverse the density regime of interest and hence to study the interplay of different processes which lead to either gelation or glassiness .",
    "furthermore , our model also allows us to tune the lifetime of bonds , a feature that is usually not present in other models ( for example , see the recent work @xcite ) . on one hand , this facilitates a wider exploration of the relaxation dynamics of such model physical gels , but also allows to disentangle the origin of the apparently anomalous relaxation observed in these systems .",
    "in fact , mode - coupling theory predicts , e.g. , logarithmic relaxation whenever two different arrest lines meet , one gel - like and another glass - like , and relates it to an underlying higher - order singularity in the theory @xcite .",
    "the versatility of our model , and in particular the possibility of tuning at will the bonds lifetime , allows us to explore the different mechanisms at play and hence to elucidate the interplay of various lengths and time - scales @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain the details of our model transient - network fluid , together with the numerical schemes used to simulate its dynamics .",
    "the phase diagram of the model system and its structural properties are discussed in sections iii and iv , respectively . in section",
    "v , we analyze in details the fluid s dynamics , quantified by the mean squared displacement and the incoherent scattering function .",
    "for that , we follow different routes across the phase diagram , which allows us to clearly understand the interplay between the gel and the glass regimes .",
    "finally , the dynamical heterogeneities which characterize the slow dynamics in the gel and glass phases are studied in section vi , followed by a summary of our results and a broader perspective in section vii .",
    "our model system is a coarse - grained representation  @xcite of a transient gel which has been studied in experiments  @xcite . in this system ,",
    "an equilibrium low - density gel is obtained by adding telechelic polymers to an oil - in - water microemulsion .",
    "since the polymer end - groups are hydrophobic , the polymers effectively act as ( attractive ) bridges between the oil droplets they connect .",
    "the strength , lengthscale and typical lifetime of these bridging polymers can be controlled at will . denoting by @xmath0 the number of polymers connecting droplets @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we have established in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the following interaction is a reasonable coarse - grained representation of this ternary system :    @xmath3    the first term is a soft repulsion acting between bare oil droplets , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the diameter of droplet @xmath1 , and @xmath6 is the distance between the droplet centers .",
    "the second term describes the entropic attraction induced by the telechelic polymers , which has the standard `` fene '' ( finitely - extensible nonlinear elastic ) form known from polymer physics  @xcite , @xmath7 , and accounts for the maximal extension @xmath8 of the polymers .",
    "the last term introduces the energy penalty @xmath9 for polymers that have both end - groups in the same droplet .",
    "the most drastic approximation of the model ( [ model ] ) is the description of the polymers as effective bonds between the droplets , which is justified whenever the typical lifetime of the bonds is much larger than the timescale for polymer dynamics in the solvent  @xcite .",
    "thus , for exploring the different properties of such a model , the relevant variables are the droplet volume fraction @xmath10 and the number of polymer heads per droplet @xmath11 @xcite . in order to describe the dynamics of the system",

    "thus @xmath14 is the timescale governing the renewal of the polymer network topology . in order to prevent crystallization at high volume fractions ( which would be the case for the monodisperse model",
    "studied earlier @xcite ) , we use a polydisperse emulsion with a flat distribution of particle sizes in the range @xmath15 $ ] ( having a mean diameter @xmath16 ) .",
    "the units of length , energy and time are respectively @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the particles .",
    "the space of control parameters is quite large .",
    "therefore we set @xmath21 as measured in experiments  @xcite , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and vary the remaining parameters @xmath25 .",
    "these choices for the parameter values leads to a phase diagram which is similar to the one obtained in experiments .",
    "our numerical simulations are done for a three dimensional system of @xmath26 particles .",
    "the equations of motions of these particles are integrated using a velocity verlet scheme with a time step of @xmath27 . here ,",
    "most of the results are reported for @xmath28 , although we also explore other values of @xmath14 : @xmath29 to illustrate some of the dynamical features of the system . at each volume fraction @xmath10 , we first equilibrate the system of particles without any links ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "once equilibrated , bonds are introduced corresponding to the required value of @xmath11 and then the system is again equilibrated to obtain the proper distribution of bonds per particle . since the structure of the network is independent of the choice of @xmath14 @xcite , we use a small value of @xmath31 to expedite the equilibration process .",
    "subsequently , data is generated by continuing the simulations with different @xmath14 values when required and the averages are typically calculated over 100 different time origins .",
    "we also do simulations for the case when the bonds between two particles are completely frozen . in order to do a proper sampling of the network configurations for this situation",
    ", we use 6 initial configurations ( positions , connectivities ) from the simulations with a finite @xmath14 as initial inputs for subsequent evolution of the particle positions using molecular dynamics with the connections now permanently fixed .",

    "the distribution of connectivities per particle is just an exponential @xcite . with increasing @xmath10 ,",
    "the dynamics in the sol regime becomes slow and one eventually enters a glassy phase at large @xmath10 , characterized by a very strong increase of the timescales for structural relaxation . if the number of bonds is large and @xmath10 is small , phase separation is observed due to strong attractions between the droplets . here , the distribution of connectivities becomes bimodal , with one of the two peaks corresponding to a well - connected liquid and the other to free particles . for intermediate values of @xmath11",
    "the system is in a gel phase . in this region of the phase diagram the particles are connected together and form a percolating cluster and the spatial density is homogeneous . here",
    ", the connectivity distribution is peaked around the average value and has an exponential tail .",
    "note that this gel is an equilibrium phase since the polymer network is constantly rewired on the timescale @xmath14 .",
    "however , if we go to large enough volume fractions , we observe again a glassy system for all connectivities , with the corresponding divergence of relaxation timescales .    at low @xmath10 , in the gel phase",
    ", the main slow relaxation process is related to the connections between the droplets by means of the polymers and the timescale associated with its reconfiguration . at low @xmath11 , as the system becomes glassy at large @xmath10 , the origin of the slow dynamics is the steric hindrance caused by the caging of each particle by its neighbors . in the region",
    "where both @xmath11 and @xmath10 act as a source for slow dynamics , we have shown that the generic relaxation process has three steps but with proper tuning of the two relaxation timescales , one can also obtain logarithmic decays of the relaxation function  @xcite .    in the following",

    "this changes in that for @xmath11 around 4 - 6 a plateau develops at intermediate and long times , the height of which depends strongly on @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of this increasing plateau height , which is reminiscent to the so called type - a transition of mode - coupling theory  @xcite , indicates that the relaxation mechanism is changing : for small @xmath11 the motion of the particles is only weakly slowed down by the presence of the bonds , which typically break on the time scale of @xmath14 .",

    "we observe , however , for @xmath60 , at intermediate times a shoulder in @xmath50 .",
    "this shoulder , clearly visible for @xmath61 , is related to the presence of the bonds that lead to a caging of the particles on the length scale related to @xmath8 , the maximum extension of a bond .",
    "thus the hint of the short - time plateau ( when @xmath62 ) and again one at later time ( when @xmath63 ) reflects the presence of the two different mechanisms for constraining particle motion , viz . local steric hindrance and the network bonds .",

    "already for @xmath30 one sees a weak plateau in @xmath50 and its length grows rapidly with increasing @xmath11 without changing much its height ( see fig.[msdt100]c ) .",

    "initially , the particles rattle inside the cage , resulting in partial relaxation of the correlation function on a timescale @xmath74 .",
    "later on , the particles escapes from the cage of neighboring particles , ( which for this value of @xmath10 not very pronounced ) , but the relaxation process is then held up by the polymer bonds . eventually , the polymer network rewires on a timescale which is proportional to @xmath69 and the particles start the final relaxation process .",
    "the height of the plateau in @xmath51 increases with decreasing @xmath39 , which is the typical behavior for a glassy system @xcite .",
    "however , for the range of wave - vectors explored , the final timescale for decay of @xmath51 depends only weakly on @xmath39 .",
    "thus , over these length scales , the relaxation process is determined by the reconfiguration of the network . however , at larger length scales , one can expect that hydrodynamic effects will eventually dominate and this will then determine the relaxation timescales .    for intermediate values of the bond lifetime , @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ r63pv61fsqall]b , the final decay has moved to shorter times and makes that now the interplay between the two processes results in a logarithmic decay of @xmath51 as discussed elsewhere @xcite .",

    "[ r63pv61fsqall]b ) , with the time - window over which it exists decreasing with decreasing @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that this form for the correlation function occurs only for specific combination of the relaxation timescales of the two processes of steric hindrance and eventual network relaxation . at sufficiently small @xmath39 ,",

    "we also note that for @xmath33 the correlator for the permanent bonds becomes very stretched .",
    "this sluggish relaxation might be related to the fact that for this value of @xmath11 there are , in addition to the percolating cluster , clusters of different sizes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for typical distributions ) , thus giving rise to relaxation dynamics that spans many orders of magnitude in time and hence to a very stretched average correlation function .",

    "this can be quantified by @xmath135 , defined above , measured for @xmath153 , i.e. we look for relaxations over distances which are slightly larger than the average particle diameter .    to have a reference we consider first the case @xmath30 , i.e. when there are no polymers and the system is just a standard glass - forming system .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath135 is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi4]a for different packing fractions . in agreement with earlier studies on similar systems , ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that @xmath135 shows a maximum at a time @xmath47 that increases with @xmath10 and which tracks the increasing relaxation time @xmath104 .",
    "the fact that the height of the peak increases with increasing @xmath10 indicates that the relaxation dynamics become more cooperative , also this in agreement with previous studies for other glass - forming systems  @xcite .",
    "next , we contrast this behavior with the case of increasing gelation , i.e. we fix a volume fraction and increase the number of polymer bonds . for this",
    ", we choose @xmath33 , i.e. the same packing fraction for which we have studied the correlation functions and the non - gaussian parameter , since for this @xmath10 the effects due to the steric hindrance as well as the network constraints are clearly observed .",
    "the corresponding @xmath135 is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi4]b for @xmath28 . for @xmath154 , the location of the peak in @xmath135 shifts to larger times and the height of the maximum increases .",
    "thus this trend follows the behavior observed in the data for @xmath51 as well as @xmath129 , indicating that steric hindrance dominates the relaxation process and that the dynamics becomes more and more collective .",
    "however , for @xmath67 , the peak height decreases again and its location becomes independent of @xmath11 .",
    "we can thus conclude that in this regime the relaxation dynamics becomes less cooperative , a result that makes sense since the rewiring of the network is not really a collective process .",
    "this result is also in qualitative agreement with the decrease of the maximum in @xmath129 , see fig .",
    "[ alpha2phi]b , which showed that the dynamics becomes more homogeneous .",
    "we conclude by investigating how the lifetime of the network - bonds influences the function @xmath135 . for this we have calculated this observable for the case @xmath87 and @xmath84 , i.e. at intermediate density and in the gel phase for which one sees a significant @xmath14-dependence in the relaxation behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fsq6t100tinf]b ) .",
    "we see , fig .  [ chi4]c , that at small and intermediate @xmath14 the location of the peak in @xmath135 moves to larger time and that its height increases somewhat , i.e. a behavior that is directly related to the steric hindrance mechanism in which the effective cage becomes stiffer due to the increased lifetime of the bonds",
    ". however , once @xmath14 exceeds @xmath43 , we see that @xmath135 no longer depends on this lifetime , i.e. the rewiring of the network no longer affects the cooperativity of the dynamics and the latter is solely dependent on the steric hindrance .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a coarse - grained model for a transient network fluid , a system that can be realized in experiments by a oil - in - water emulsion . by tuning the volume fraction @xmath10 of the constituent particles , the number of bonds @xmath11 between the mesoparticle , and the lifetime @xmath14 of these connections , we have scanned across the phase diagram to investigate the relaxation dynamics of this system , in particular the interplay between the gel - transition and the glass transition induced by steric hindrance effects .    by analyzing the mean - squared displacement and self intermediate scattering function",
    "we find that the nature of the slowing down depends on the packing fraction : at low @xmath10 an increase of @xmath11 leads to a two step relaxation with a plateau that increases continuously with @xmath11 and an @xmath155relaxation time that is independent of @xmath11 and that is related to the lifetime of the bonds .",
    "in contrast to this we find at large @xmath10 a two step relaxation with a plateau height that is basically independent of @xmath11 whereas the relaxation time does depend on the density of bonds .",
    "thus these two different behaviors show that the system can show a glassy dynamics that is related on one hand to a gel transition and on the other hand to a glass transition associated with the steric hindrance mechanism . for intermediate densities and a certain range of @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath14 the interplay between these two mechanisms leads to a decay of the time correlation function that is logarithmic over several decades in time , whereas for other combinations it gives rise to a three step relaxation .",
    "we note here that a similar multistep relaxation pattern has been recently reported for mixtures of _ multiarm _ telechelic polymers and oil - in - water microemulsions @xcite , suggesting the existence of a competition of different arrest length- and time - scales in these systems .",
    "we have also studied how the height of the plateau at long times , i.e. the debye - waller factor , depends on the wave - vector and found that it decays in an exponential manner in @xmath39 , i.e. very different from the gaussian decay observed in more standard glass - forming systems .",
    "furthermore we have determined the relaxation times of the system and find that these can approximately be factorized into a function that depends strongly on @xmath11 and a vogel - fulcher type dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath57dependent factor shows for @xmath156 a strong exponential dependence that is related to the escape of the particles from the local cage , whereas for larger values of @xmath11 the dependence is weaker and linked to an arrhenius - like process for bond - breaking .    by studying the non - gaussian parameter we have probed to what extent",
    "the relaxation dynamics of the system is heterogeneous . at low packing fraction",
    "this dynamics becomes extremely heterogeneous , if @xmath11 is not too large , since some of the particles are very strongly connected to their neighbors ( and hence are immobile ) whereas others can move almost freely .",
    "however , if @xmath11 becomes larger than 6 , the relaxation dynamics becomes again quite homogeneous since at any time all particles are well connected to their neighbors . at large packing fractions",
    "the non - gaussian parameter shows a double peak structure and , by monitoring the van hove function , we can show that this feature is directly related to the two relaxation processes , i.e. the steric hindrance and the connectivity of the network .",
    "whether or not the relaxation dynamics is cooperative can be characterized by the four - point correlation function @xmath135 .",
    "we find that for large packing fractions the height of the peak in @xmath135 increases rapidly with @xmath11 , showing that the strengthened coupling leads to an enhanced cooperative motion .",
    "however , if @xmath11 is increased beyond 6 , this cooperativity decreases again , since the relaxation dynamics is strongly dominated by the rewiring of the network , i.e. a non - cooperative process .    summarizing",
    "we see that the interplay between the two different mechanisms giving rise to glassy behavior can lead a rather complex and unusual relaxation dynamics . in the present study",
    "we have focused on a system in which the particles are connected by polymers having a fixed extension length @xmath157 . for much smaller extension lengths",
    ", one can expect to recover the re - entrant scenario observed in colloidal gels @xcite . for longer extension lengths",
    ", the particles will instead have more space to explore and it will likely result in a even more floppy network . in the future , it would certainly be worthwhile to explore also systems that have polymers with different value of @xmath8 , since this implies multiple localization lengths and thus provide novel relaxation scenarios that can subsequently also studied in experiments . and",
    "finally we recall that our model is motivated by an experimental system which has highly nontrivial rheological properties , e.g. this material flows like a liquid but eventually breaks as a brittle solid @xcite , being capable of self - healing through thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , in the future we plan to study the rheological properties of our model in order to understand the microscopic mechanisms that lead to the experimental observations .",
