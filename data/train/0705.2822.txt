    "they are also the classical object of study in the theory of orthogonal polynomials which recently acquired new effective tools to investigate the asymptotical properties of families of such solutions , see @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our study was a number of rather surprising numerical experiments in calculating the zeros of polynomial eigenfunctions for the usual spectral problem which led to several conjectures presented in @xcite .",
    "most of these conjectures were later proved in @xcite .",

    "by contrast with the latter case the development of this theory for higher order equations experiences serious difficulties .",
    "these are mostly due to the appearance of new stokes lines ( discovered in @xcite ) originating from the intersection points of the initial stokes lines which emanate from the turning points of the considered equation .",
