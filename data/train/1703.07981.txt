    "the zero - range interaction model is , undoubtedly , one of the oldest and most essential models in nuclear physics .",
    "it provides a reference framework and allows us to qualitatively grasp some important features of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "understanding what happens in the limiting case of the zero - range interaction help us to clarify qualitatively the effect of a cutoff associated with a finite range interaction .",
    "that s why it is useful to find and compare the solutions for the zero - range interaction for different few - body systems in various approaches .",
    "it is well known that in a non - relativistic three - body system with zero - range interaction the binding energy is not limited from below ( thomas collapse @xcite ) .",
    "a variational proof of the thomas effect in non - relativistic three - body systems can be found in @xcite and the non - relativistic limit of few - body systems for the @xmath0 theory was studied in @xcite . for the relativistic three - body bound system with zero - range interaction the covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for the faddeev component was derived in @xcite . in that work , the corresponding three - body equation in the light - front ( lf ) dynamics",
    "was also derived by projecting the bs equation on the lf plane .",
    "later it was re - derived independently of the bs approach , i.e. , in the lf framework only @xcite .",
    "in both papers  @xcite the lf equation was solved numerically . in the aforementioned references",
    "it was concluded that the thomas collapse is prevented in relativistic three - body systems , since the relativistic effects generates an effective repulsion at small distances .",
    "the three - body bs equation with zero - range interaction was never solved so far .",
    "finding its solution has remained for a long time an important and challenging problem .",
    "of course , after avoiding the thomas collapse in the lf framework , used in the previous works where only the valence component was considered , one can hardly expect that it will again appear in the bs framework .",
    "however , there are other important questions which can be clarified by solving the three - body bs equation and comparing the result with the lf one . for example",
    ", higher fock components can have a significant effect even in two - body systems as shown in  @xcite and it is expected to be even more substantial in the three - body case @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus two - fold :    ( _ i _ ) we solve , for the first time , the three - body bs equation with the zero - range interaction . for this aim ,",
    "we transform the minkowski bs equation in a suitable form to be expressed in the euclidean space . from the point of view of time - ordered graphs appearing in lf dynamics",
    ", the three - body bs equation takes into account extra graphs incorporating antiparticles .",
    "in fact , they generate the effective three - body forces of relativistic origin . for the one boson exchange ( obe )",
    "interaction , the manifestation of the lf induced three - body forces was studied in @xcite . in the obe model",
    "the three - body forces appear also in absence of antiparticles whereas , as it is found in that paper , for the zero - range interaction , the intermediate antiparticles are mandatory for generating the three - body forces . comparison of the results found by solving the lf and bs equations is instructive and it sheds light on the properties of the relativistic three - body systems with the zero - range interaction .",
    "we will calculate and compare also the dependencies of the lf and bs amplitudes on the transverse momenta .",
    "fully poincar - covariant computation of the nucleon s faddeev amplitude with a ladder dressed - gluon exchange interaction was performed in @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) it turns out that though the three - body state studied in @xcite for the interaction providing the existence of a two - body bound state is indeed the most low - lying physical state ( with minimal _ positive _ three - body mass @xmath1 ) , there exists another ( non - physical ) low - lying state with _ negative _ @xmath1 .",
    "this is a  heavy legacy \" of the thomas collapse .",
    "formally , from the point of view of the spectrum classification , the latter state is just the ground state ( since it has the smallest @xmath1 ) , whereas the state found in @xcite ( and interpreted as the ground state ) is the first excited state . by varying the two - body scattering length , we can push the ground state into the domain of the positive mass @xmath1 , so it becomes a physical state .",
    "in this situation the excited state found in @xcite does not exist anymore , since it was already driven into the continuous spectrum .",
    "this happens in both approaches  the lf and bs ones , and the difference between them is in the numerical values of the parameters , as we will show here .",
    "below we will discover and study this true low - lying state .",
    "this is another aim of our work .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sections",

    "[ concl ] we draw the conclusions .",
    "the zero - range three - body bs equation for the vertex function @xmath3 from which the external propagators are excluded , for zero - range interaction , has the form @xcite : @xmath4 } \\frac { i}{[(p - q - k)^2-m^2+i\\epsilon ] } v(k , p).\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the faddeev component and , besides the total momentum @xmath5 , it depends on one four - momentum @xmath6 only .",
    "the function @xmath7 is the two - body zero - range scattering amplitude found in a relativistic framework .",
    "it is given in @xcite .",
    "for completeness we cite it here , however , using as a parameter , the scattering length @xmath8 : @xmath9 its argument @xmath10 is two - body effective mass : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "if the two - body system has a bound state with the mass @xmath14 , then @xmath8 is positive and it is related to the bound state mass @xmath14 as : @xmath15 if @xmath16 , the amplitude @xmath7 has no pole in the physical domain @xmath17 , that is , the two - body bound state is absent .",
    "however , as we will see below , the three - body system still can be bound as a borromean state .    as mentioned , to simplify finding the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) , instead of the minkowski space bs equation ( [ 3b ] ) , we will solve the corresponding integral equation in the euclidean space .",
    "it provides the same spectrum , but different amplitudes .",
    "the euclidean equation is obtained by the wick rotation of the integration contour , when it is possible . in eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) it is impossible : one can easily check that the position of singularities in the variable @xmath18 of the integrand in ( [ 3b ] ) prevents from this rotation .",
    "that is , the rotating contour crosses the singularities of the integrand .",
    "this was the obstacle in finding solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) . however , the shift of the rotation point changes the relative position of the rotating contour and singularities and might allow to avoid their crossings .",
    "we notice that the wick rotation becomes possible after the following shift of variables : @xmath19 after introducing new functions : @xmath20 the equation ( [ 3b ] ) obtains the form : @xmath21\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{3}p - q'-k'\\right)^2-m^2+i\\epsilon\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 . in the three - particle rest frame , for example",
    ", the position of the pole ( above the real axes ) of the second propagator in ( [ 3bp ] ) in the variable @xmath23 is in the point @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for the bound state @xmath26 , the value of @xmath27 is always negative : @xmath28 .",
    "we rotate the line of integration over @xmath29 by the angle @xmath30 and simultaneously replace @xmath31 . then the pole and the contour move so that the pole never crosses the contour .",
    "the amplitude @xmath32 has also a pole at @xmath33 , corresponding to the two - body bound state , if any .",
    "it generates two poles in @xmath34 vs. @xmath23 .",
    "one can easily check that if @xmath35 ( this is the case , since the three - body binding energy per particle is larger that the two - body one ) , then these poles also do not prevent the wick rotation .",
    "therefore we can safely make the wick rotation in eq .",
    "( [ 3bp ] ) , in contrast to the eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) .    in the rest frame , after wick rotation by the angle @xmath36 : @xmath37 , and after integrating in ( [ 3bp ] ) over the angles between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we obtain the equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( similarly for @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "( [ 3be ] ) will be solved numerically below .    by performing the complex conjugation in ( [ 3be ] ) and ( [ 3be ] ) and changing @xmath45 , we find the same equation for @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 , or : @xmath48={\\rm re}[v_e(q_4,q_v)],\\quad { \\rm im}[v_e(-q_4,q_v)]=-{\\rm im}[v_e(q_4,q_v ) ] .",

    "these examples show that the number of particles in the intermediate states is not restricted - it can be arbitrary . by comparing the results found by eqs .",

    "the lf wave function is related to the integral over @xmath62 of the minkowski bs amplitude .",

    "however , since the double integrals of the minkowski bs amplitude over @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and of the euclidean one over @xmath64 are the same ( up to a jacobian ) , this allows us to relate the integral of the euclidean bs amplitude with an integral of the lf wave function .",
