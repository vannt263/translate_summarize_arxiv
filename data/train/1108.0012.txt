    "granular packings can exist over a range of densities generally depending on the generation protocol and the nature of the grain - grain interactions . for _ frictionless _ spheres , where the particle friction coefficient @xmath5 , _ random close packing _ ( rcp ) , or the maximally random jammed state , describes the densest possible packing of dry , cohesionless , spheres whose structure contains no long - range order @xcite .",
    "random close packing is well - defined in the sense that it represents a reproducible packing state as observed in numerous experiments and simulations of frictionless sphere packings of hard particles that interact primarily through excluded volume effects @xcite .",
    "all such studies agree that random close packing occurs at a packing fraction , @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "this is in contrast to _ frictional _ packings , @xmath8 , which can exist over a substantial range in packing fraction from @xmath6 all the way down to @xmath9 , the value often quoted as _ random loose packing _ @xcite .",
    "although , in reality , it is actually quite difficult to generate loose packed states .",
    "consequently , random loose packing is a much less well - developed concept than random close packing .",
    "the strong history dependence and characterisation of frictional packings persists as an experimental issue thus opening the door for simulations to shed light on the nature of random loose packing of frictional particles .",
    "frictionless sphere - packings and the rcp state have received much focus in terms of _ jamming _ - the transition from a jammed , rigid , solid - like state , with finite shear and bulk moduli , to an unjammed , liquid - like state @xcite . the simplest system exhibiting such a transition occurs in a packing of over - compressed , purely - repulsive , soft , frictionless spheres , at zero temperature in the absence of gravity . as the packing fraction , @xmath10 , is decreased , the packing undergoes a transition at @xmath11 , between jammed and unjammed phases that occurs abruptly at @xmath12 . approaching the jamming transition from above , @xmath13 , the average number of contacting neighbours per particle - the coordination number @xmath14 - approaches the minimal value required for mechanical stability @xmath15 , also known as isostaticity . for frictionless spheres , @xmath16 ( in @xmath17 , @xmath18 in @xmath19 ) @xcite",
    "thus , the interplay between mechanical stability and maximally random @xcite , in some sense , provides a meaningful operational definition of the rcp state . although it is worthwhile to note that the particle positions are disordered - no long range order exists - but they are not completely random as they must satisfy mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the question now arises , to what extent do these developing ideas of jamming apply more generally in systems with non - central force laws , such as frictional , granular packings ?",
    "the identification of the jamming threshold in frictionless sphere packings to the well - known rcp state begs the question , can these same ideas lead to a more concrete definition of the random loose packing state for frictional spheres ?",
    "these concerns are investigated here by studying how interparticle friction affects the jamming properties of monodisperse spheres .",
    "here it is shown that the extrapolated values of the packing fraction @xmath20 , and the coordination number @xmath21 , at the jamming transition depend on the friction coefficient @xmath0 , as presented in [ table1 ] and [ fig1 ] , in agreement with conclusions of recent experiments @xcite and theory @xcite , and that @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( in @xmath17 , @xmath25 in @xmath19 ) in the limit of large friction . here",

    "after this rapid compression the configurations were then allowed to relax into a mechanically stable state . unless otherwise stated , during this initial compression friction was switched off . in an alternative protocol to be discussed later , friction was switched on during the initial quench to the over - compressed state .",
    "the packing fraction of these mechanically stable packings were then incrementally decreased towards the jamming threshold with the friction coefficient set at the desired value .",

    "notably , on careful inspection of the data at @xmath54 , which has been emphasised in the figures and corresponds to a value of the friction coefficient the smallest forces only for friction coefficients where the critical values are decreasing with friction in [ fig1 ] , both the normal and tangential distributions exhibit an upturn at the smallest forces . thus indicating that the decrease in the critical values indicated in [ fig1 ] is correlated with the fraction of small forces in the system .      motivated by earlier studies on frictionless systems ,",

    "this can be seen by comparing the various interaction and simulation models ( linear - spring or hertzian interaction forces , molecular dynamics or contact dynamics simulations ) @xcite . however , the path taken to arrive at the jamming transition may differ , particularly when friction is present . because of the hysteretic nature of the frictional forces the precise force configurations explored during this path will depend on the preparation history of the packings .    , of the plasticity index , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 are the magnitudes of the normal and tangential forces , for different friction coefficients @xmath0 , within @xmath108 of the jamming threshold.,width=302 ]    the major factor influencing the frictional forces are the fraction of slipping contacts @xmath109 .",

    "the qualitative nature of the results are not sensitive to the precise definition of slipping contacts .",
    "the data of [ fig7 ] shows how the probability distributions @xmath114 depend of friction coefficient for packings prepared very close to the jamming threshold . for small friction coefficients @xmath115 ,",
    "the distributions are dominated by a large fraction of contacts that are close to yielding , @xmath116 .",
    "these systems correspond to points in [ fig1 ] just before the rapid decrease in @xmath1 with @xmath0 .",
    "however , for larger friction coefficients , @xmath117 , where the transition values begin to saturate , the weight of the distribution shifts to smaller @xmath118 .",
    "hence , a majority of contacts become stabilised as seen by the growth of a hump at @xmath119 for @xmath120 in [ fig7 ] .",
    "similar changes in @xmath114 have been seen in simulations of confined packings @xcite and two dimensional systems @xcite .     at @xmath121 over a large range in friction coefficients . by definition , @xmath122 .",
    "the two sets of data represent two slightly different protocols as discussed in the text .",
    "differences at small friction values diminish at larger friction coefficients for the two protocols.,width=302 ]    although the qualitative features of the distributions shown in [ fig7 ] are robust over different protocols , the actual numbers of slipping contacts depends on the preparation history of the packings . to illustrate this point [ fig8 ] shows the fraction , @xmath109 , of slipping contacts over a wide range of friction coefficients for packings that are close to the jamming threshold .",
    "the two sets of data correspond to slightly different packing preparation histories .",
    "the open symbols are for the protocol used throughout this work to generate the previously shown data : a dilute packing was over - compressed with friction initially set to zero prior to the decompression procedure .",
    "the filled symbols , on the other hand , are for packings where friction was set to the desired value during the initial over - compression stage .",
    "the differences between the two protocols clearly show up at the lower friction coefficients where the newly modified protocol exhibits a much larger fraction of slipping contacts .",
    "the rapid compression with friction leads to a build up of the frictional forces that quickly causes contacts to reach the coulomb yield criterion as the system is decompressed towards the jamming threshold .",
    "these differences diminish for larger friction coefficients .",
    "the exact nature of the frictional build up and relaxation is currently under investigation .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the extrapolated jamming thresholds are identical within statistical uncertainty between the two protocols .",
    "thus , the protocol dependence does not seem to affect the geometrical properties of the packing , but will likely have an effect on mechanical properties , such as yielding under flow or the application of external forces .    to probe the nature of protocol dependence further ,",
    "the algorithm used to generate the packings was also modified in the following ways : in one case a dynamic friction model was used that depends only on the instantaneous friction force . for this system the jamming threshold lies much closer to the frictionless limit . in the other data ,",
    "the history of the contacts was reset at different intervals during the simulation procedure thereby suppressing the build - up of frictional forces .",
    "the corresponding evolution of the coordination number with packing fraction is shown in [ fig9 ] for packings",
    "these packings where the contact history and frictional forces were treated differently .    , with decreasing packing fraction , @xmath10 .",
    "line styles represent different friction models : frictionless ( @xmath47 , solid line ) ; history - dependent static friction model ( dotted ) , static - friction model reset at different rates ( dot - dash and dash ) , and dynamic instantaneous friction model with no contact history ( long - dash ) , @xmath123 .",
    "inset shows the random close packing region.,width=302 ]    thus , erasing the history of the frictional forces between particles in contact can have a profound effect on the resulting evolution of the packing .",
    "what [ fig9 ] demonstrates is that friction strongly influences the jamming thresholds and hence the possible range of mechanically stable states for a given friction coefficient .",
    "this may therefore explain , in part , the observation why real , frictional granular materials , more often than not , tend to form packings that are intermediate between the random close and random loose limits : even minor rearrangements that cause the particles to momentarily come out of contact will erase the history of frictional contacts and thus the system will appear to be composed of particles of a lower friction coefficient that their actual values .",
    "this aspect of the history dependence of the frictional forces has been utilised recently in experiments on real , frictional , granular particles made to mimic frictionless systems @xcite .",
    "in summary , cohesionless , frictional spheres that interact only on contact , exhibit a jamming transition that shares many similarities with that for frictionless systems , provided one identifies the appropriate friction - dependent jamming transition packing fraction @xmath20 , and coordination number @xmath21 . using these friction - dependent quantities rather than just the frictionless and frictional isostatic values may lead to a better understanding of existing scaling results @xcite . in saying that , the role of packing generation protocol and friction - induced history dependence persists as a topic that has received relatively little attention to date . understanding how packings traverse the packing stability diagram of [ fig1 ]",
    "will likely help resolve some of these issues .",
    "random loose packing , @xmath9 , appears to be a state that can only be achieved in the large - friction limit .",
    "these results , however , do not preclude the fact that even lower values of @xmath23 may be obtained using different protocols , such as sedimenting particles in a fluid @xcite , or tuning the particle interactions to include additional forces , such as cohesion @xcite .",
    "the power - law dependence on @xmath0 of both @xmath124 and @xmath125 , relative to the frictionless system hints at a more universal behaviour .",
    "the origin of these scalings remain unclear although one possible explanation for the results of [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] might lie in spatial correlations between the frictional forces .",
    "as shown in [ fig8 ] , there is a systematic decrease in the fraction of slipping contacts with increasing friction .",
    "one might therefore expect that for small friction coefficients there are large spatial regions of contacts that are slipping , whereas for large friction , these are replaced by non - mobilised contacts .",
    "hence , fluctuations are small in either case .",
    "however , intermediate between these two extreme states , large - scale , fluctuating regions might occur .",
    "preliminary data suggests that there is indeed an increase in correlations that follow these arguments and such ideas are currently being pursued .",
    "applications of the results presented here could potentially pave the way towards a generalised formulation of an equation of state for granular materials .",
    "progress along these lines has been made recently @xcite .",
    "however , the hysteretic nature of the frictional forces can have a significant effect on the properties of the packing .",
    "it is interesting to note that the friction coefficients of many materials lie in the range @xmath126 . coincidentally , these values of @xmath0 correspond to the region of mechanically stable states where small changes in @xmath0 can lead to large changes in the packing fraction and coordination number of the packing .",
    "hence , any processes that cause changes in the surface friction of the constituent particles , such as roughening or polishing , can result in packings with dramatically different stability properties .",
    "alternatively , materials could be designed with varying mechanical properties based on their frictional properties .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank m. van hecke and m. schrter for several insightful discussions related to this work .",
