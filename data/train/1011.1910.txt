    "what particle physics information can be extracted from a detection of events at a dark matter direct detection experiment ?",
    "this seemingly innocuous question is riddled with subtleties and uncertainties .",
    "the main experimental uncertainties relate to separating signal from background , and translating observed energy in a detector to nuclear recoil energy .",
    "the main astrophysical uncertainties are the local properties of dark matter for which direct detection is sensitive : the local velocity distribution and the local density .",
    "the average density of dark matter at a galactic radius equal to the sun is reasonably well known based on galactic kinematics ( for a recent discussion , see @xcite )",
    ". the local density could be quite different ; simulations that try to quantify the likelihood that the local density differs from the average density have been done , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the simulations suggest the local dark matter density is within one to several orders of magnitude from the canonical value of @xmath5  gev/@xmath6 , with more uncertainty on the lower bound than on the upper bound , depending on the likelihood one is willing to tolerate .",
    "this implies a minimum uncertainty of one to several orders of magnitude on the direct detection cross section .",
    "( as we will see , there remain several additional sources of uncertainty . )",
    "the velocity distribution is even more subtle . _",
    "a priori _ not much is known about the velocity distribution , although there has been substantial work to estimate its form using @xmath7-body simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations are generally excellent tracers of the _ average _ properties of the velocity distribution for a galaxy that is _ like _ the milky way",
    ". they do not , however , have the level of resolution needed to determine the local velocity distribution .",
    "moreover , while most simulations do not incorporate the feedback effects of matter , those that do find interesting `` dark disk '' structure @xcite . as has been recently emphasized in @xcite , even isotropic spherically symmetric velocity distributions derived from equilibrium distributions of dark matter density result in departures from the maxwellian distribution .",
    "local effects on the density and velocity distribution by solar and gravitational capture have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "direct astronomical observations of the local stellar neighborhood can be inferred to give information on local properties of dark matter .",
    "the rave survey has constrained the local galactic escape speed @xcite .",
    "the values lie in a fairly large range , from @xmath8  km / s , depending on the parameterization of the distribution of stellar velocities .",
    "observations have also shed light on non - equilibrium local stellar motion , such as the possibility of `` streams '' of stars relatively nearby to the sun .",
    "tidal streams can arise from a disrupting satellite dwarf galaxy or star cluster .",
    "there has been evidence of streams in the solar neighborhood for some time @xcite .",
    "more recent work with newer stellar surveys , including rave , sdss , etc .",
    ", suggest streams are present @xcite ( although other work does not find evidence for local streams oriented along the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk @xcite ) . if a tidal stream of stars provides a good tracer of dark matter , this or other local structure could significantly affect dark matter direct detection measurements @xcite . generally speaking , however , prior work has considered streams or other non - maxwellian structure as perturbations on top of a ( quasi-)maxwellian distribution .",
    "our conclusion is that while the average density and average velocity distribution at the sun s galactic radius do seem to be determined reasonably well from both observations and @xmath7-body simulations , the _ local _ dark matter density and _ local _ dark matter velocity distribution remain highly uncertain .",
    "breaking with the vast majority of prior literature on dark matter direct detection , we consider what particle physics properties can be unambiguously extracted while making essentially no assumptions about the density and velocity distribution of dark matter .",
    "we approach this subject making the following simplifying assumptions :    * one direct detection experiment reports several events that can be interpreted as dark matter scattering off nuclei . *",
    "nuclear recoil events are consistent with scattering off only one type of nuclei .",
    "the scattering process off these nuclei is dominated by _ either _ a spin - independent or spin - dependent process , but not both . *",
    "no significant time variation of the rate of events is found , and no directional detection is observed .",
    "since the main purpose of this paper is point out what can ( or can not ) be extracted from a recoil spectrum independent of local density and velocity distribution , we focus on what can be obtained from just one experiment ( or , equivalently , treat several experiments results independently ) .",
    "making the second assumption is , for many experiments , not an assumption at all when detectors are made of a uniform material ( e.g.  xenon100 , lux , cdms , etc . ) . even in experiments consisting of multiple nuclei with very different masses ( e.g.  cresst )",
    ", it would require a remarkable coincidence to have the experiment s proportions - by - mass of different nuclei arranged such that dark matter were able to scatter off several of them simultaneously with large signal over background . for spin - dependent cross sections ,",
    "typically only a few isotopes dominate .",
    "again , it would be a remarkable coincidence to have two separate scattering processes ( either both spin - dependent or one spin - dependent and one spin - independent ) contributing to a nuclear recoil signal in a single experiment .    the third point , that we do not consider time variation or directional dependence in rates , is a more serious omission .",
    "indeed , time variation is itself an intriguing signal , especially given the longstanding annual modulation observed by dama @xcite .",
    "however , we already have our work cut out for us with the comparatively mundane time - independent signal .",
    "indeed , it is likely that convincing evidence of time variation , or directional detection , will require years of exposure .",
    "nevertheless , some work on the effect of dark matter streams on direct detection has already been done in e.g.@xcite . we expect to return to this pressing issue of the purely particle physics implications of time variation and directional detection , independent of density or velocity distribution , in future work .",
    "the upshot of these assumptions is that we consider a collection of nuclear recoil events and analyze their consequences . given the strong bounds on spin - dependent scattering from collider searches @xcite , we will mostly concentrate on the case of spin - independent scattering",
    ". however , our formalism and philosophy applies to both types of scattering .",
    "we will find that some characteristics of the recoil spectrum are highly dependent on the astrophysical inputs , while others are totally independent of it .",
    "we will , of course , extract far less information than is usually presented in the literature , but the information we do extract is far more robust in the sense that it does not rely on any properties of the local dark matter halo .",
    "however , since the _ only _ way we can unambiguously probe the dark matter velocity distribution and abundance at the earth s position is through direct detection , we argue that anything beyond what we claim here ultimately suffers from dependency on local astrophysical properties of dark matter .",
    "we assume dark matter consists of a set of uncolored and uncharged particles @xmath9 with mass @xmath10 , velocity distribution @xmath11 , and density @xmath12 . the dark matter velocities are taken to be in the earth frame .",
    "this is a significant departure from conventional analyses .",
    "it is much more typical to take a galactic frame velocity distribution , motivated by simulations or simplifying assumptions about the galactic distribution , and boost into earth frame . for us , since our velocity distributions @xmath4 are specified in earth frame , they can be used directly for direct detection scattering . however , since time - independent dark matter scattering depends only on the _ magnitude _ of the relative velocity , there is no way to determine the magnitude in the galactic frame outside of a kinematic range .",
    "this should be kept in mind when viewing velocity distributions later in the paper .",
    "we will mostly consider examples with just one dark matter candidate , although the formalism we develop below will apply to an arbitrary set of wimps .",
    "for any given dark matter particle @xmath13 , it is useful to first consider the kinematics of the most general direct detection recoil event .",
    "we consider a collision between @xmath13 with mass @xmath14 , moving with velocity @xmath15 in the earth s frame , and a nucleus @xmath7 with mass @xmath16 , that is stationary .",
    "the result of this collision , in the most general two - to - two case , will be an outgoing dark - sector particle , @xmath17 , and an outgoing visible - sector particle , @xmath18 .",
    "we define @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and work in the approximation that @xmath21 , i.e. , the mass differences between incoming and outgoing particles are small . while generally the nucleus is not changed as a result of wimp scattering , there are notable exceptions , such as nuclear excitation @xcite and rdm with neutron emission @xcite .    in the center - of - momentum frame , where @xmath15 is the relative velocity of the two incoming particles ,",
    "the incoming momentum is @xmath22 and the outgoing momentum is @xmath23 .",
    "here we use the reduced mass defined with respect to the incoming particles , @xmath24 the recoil energy of the collision is @xmath25 with q^2 = p^2 + p^2 - 2 p p^_com .",

    "up to higher order terms in @xmath35 , we obtain an expression for the recoil energy e_r^2 + 2 e_r ( - v^2 ^2_lab ) + ^2 = 0 [ eq : er ] the recoil energy is unique for a given fixed scattering relative velocity @xmath27 and nucleus recoil angle @xmath36 and can be solved by the usual quadratic formula , e_r & = & .",
    "[ eq : ersoln ] this result has the well known feature that the smallest recoil energies come from maximizing @xmath37 , corresponding physically to head - on collisions at the highest velocities available .",
    "our basic assumptions consist of assuming the scattering process is off only one type of nuclei .",
    "we will , however , remain general with respect to the possibility of multiple wimps with different masses , abundances , and cross sections .",
    "one might think it requires a large coincidence to have several dark matter particles with cross sections large enough to produce events in an experiment .",
    "however , there are well known counterexamples where it can be natural to have the abundance of particles to be independent of their mass ( and thus , have several candidates of different masses with similar abundances , using for example the wimpless miracle @xcite ) .",
    "the event rate of dark matter scattering @xcite , differential in @xmath26 , is determined by [ eq : rateeq ] = _ i _ v_i,^v _ d^3 _ i f_i(_i(t ) )  , where the sum is over different species of wimps , @xmath38 is the nucleus mass with @xmath39 the proton mass and @xmath40 the atomic number .",
    "the recoil energy depends on the kinematics of the collision , as described above .",
    "given our assumption of no significant time variation in the rate , @xmath41 , and thus we are effectively neglecting the earth s motion around the sun .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation so long we are probing velocities larger than earth s velocity in the sun s frame , i.e. , @xmath42  km / s . typically the maximum speed is taken to be @xmath43 , the galactic escape velocity boosted into the earth frame .",

    "clearly , masses much heavier than considered by cogent are allowed , while arbitrarily large masses ( represented by @xmath94  gev ) may be constrained by this existing or future xenon data . in any case , our central conclusion is that qualitatively larger dark matter masses can fit the cogent data if the velocity distribution is adjusted as we illustrated above .    .",
    "the lines correspond to @xmath101 from left to right .",
    "notice that the normalization corresponds to thousands of events at xenon10 or xenon100.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      due to the splitting of inelastic dark matter , @xmath82 is not monotonic in @xmath26 , which means that the highest energy recoil events may not give the strongest bound on the dark matter parameters .",
    "the expression for @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmin ] ) , has a minimum , and correspondingly the deconvoluted recoil spectrum , @xmath54 , has a peak at e_r^peak =  , [ eq : recoilpeak ] the observed spectrum , @xmath102 , typically has a peak at a lower energy due to the nuclear form factor .",
    "whether the highest or lowest energy bins of an experiment place the strongest constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath103 depends on where this peak falls .",
    "if @xmath104 is large enough there may even be an observable gap between an experiment s lower threshold and the first recoil events  this bump - like spectrum aids in fitting the energy spectrum of the dama modulation data .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath104 is below the lower threshold it is not possible to distinguish idm from conventional elastic dark matter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : idmkinematics ] we illustrate these points for the case of a xenon experiment which records data over the range @xmath105 .         unlike edm , where the recoil spectrum must be monotonically decreasing , the mass splitting of idm allows for the spectrum to be a rising function for @xmath106 .",
    "this can not be mimicked by elastic scattering without a dark matter form factor , no matter what ( physically allowed ) form the velocity distribution takes .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath104 the denominator in ( [ eq : ffrominversion ] ) has a zero but since @xmath57 must be finite the recoil spectrum must have a maximum at this same energy so the numerator goes to zero as well .",
    "thus the observation of a maximum in the recoil spectrum determines @xmath104 and reduces the 3 dimensional idm parameter space by one dimension , relating @xmath14 and @xmath103 , independent of knowledge of the dark matter velocity distribution .",
    "although the spectrum of idm can not be faked by simple elastically scattering dm , regardless of what physical velocity distribution is used , it may be faked by elastically scattering dark matter that has a non - trivial form factor . due to the unique kinematics of idm , induced by the splitting of the states ,",
    "a deconvoluted idm spectrum has a gap in the low energy spectrum with no recoil events .",
    "the size of this gap , and thus the position of the first events is e_r^gap = ( v_max^2 - - )  .",
    "this can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ersoln ] ) by calculating the lowest recoil energy for the highest velocity ( @xmath107 ) for a head - on collision ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the spectrum then increases to @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : recoilpeak ] ) , before again decreasing . near the peak ,",
    "the spectrum is well fit by a power law but away from the peak the spectrum becomes more exponential in nature .",
    "this increase in @xmath54 between @xmath109 and @xmath104 would require an unphysical @xmath110 if the dark matter has no form factor .",
    "however , it is possible that a non - trivial @xmath111 could `` overpower '' this increase and allow idm spectra to be fit by edm with a form factor , albeit for a non - maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "we demonstrate this below for the simple example of a form factor that is a single power in @xmath26 , @xmath112 , for a sufficiently high @xmath113 the resulting @xmath57 will be sensible .",
    "although the increase in the recoil spectrum can be accommodated by elastically scattering dark matter with a non - trivial form factor , the existence of a gap with idm can not be faked with a simple power - law form factor .",
    "this is because the threshold to up - scatter results in a step function turn on in the spectrum , and no such step function results from a simple polynomial form for @xmath67 .    to illustrate the ability of idm to be faked by form factor dark matter .",
    "we consider the simple case of @xmath114 with the normalization @xmath115 and we take @xmath116 $ ] and investigate whether there is a physically sensible velocity distribution that allows form factor dark matter ( with the same wimp mass ) to fake idm with @xmath117  gev , with a maxwellian velocity distribution , for various splittings @xmath103 .",
    "this region in which idm can indeed be faked is shown as the shaded region in figure  [ fig : idmfake ] and an example velocity distribution that achieves this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idmfakerveldisp ] .     can fake idm with splitting @xmath103 .",

    "bottom : the idm maxwellian velocity distribution is shown as the the red dashed curve . the solid gray curve corresponds to the velocity distribution that exactly matches the recoil spectrum shown in the top figure , but with dark matter , of the same mass , scattering elastically with a form factor @xmath121.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]  gev and @xmath119  kev within the range @xmath120 .",

    "we have shown that certain particle physics properties can be determined from the nuclear recoil spectrum of a dark matter direct detection experiment independent of the local astrophysical density and velocity distribution .",
    "these properties are most easily uncovered from the deconvoluted scattering rate , that we call @xmath54 .",
    "we advocate that experiments present their recoil spectrum data in terms of the deconvoluted spectrum , from which the shape of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath26 can be read off independently of the nuclear form factor .",
    "the kinematics of scattering leads to a lower bound on dark matter mass , given a maximum speed for the wimp in the earth s frame , independent of the details of the dark matter velocity distribution .",
    "we have also shown that an upper bound on the mass of dark matter , however , _ can not _ be determined independently of the density and velocity distributions of dark matter .",
    "this was demonstrated for both `` fake '' xenon data , but also for the cogent excess .",
    "perhaps the most striking consequence is that we find the cogent excess can be fit by dark matter with masses much heavier than has been generally considered .",
    "much of this parameter space , up to @xmath122 , is no more strongly constrained than light dark matter , given an appropriate choice of velocity distribution . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the cogent data may or may not be allowed by existing xenon10 and xenon100 data , which ultimately depend on the details of @xmath100 and @xmath124 .    our analysis comparing different masses , as well as comparing and contrasting inelastic dark matter with form factor dark matter , was done without any experimental errors .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out similar analyses with experimental errors .",
    "for example , the so - called `` gap '' in inelastic dark matter may not be resolvable due to experimental errors , so that it may be reproduced by a smooth dark matter form factor .    breaking from the vast majority of past literature",
    ", we do not impose any requirements of the velocity distribution of dark matter , except for assuming there is an upper bound ( that might or might not be equated to @xmath125 in earth s frame ) . in fact , our velocity distributions were taken to be in earth s frame , and thus to compare with most other literature one would have to boost into galactic frame .",
    "interestingly , however , there are potential physical realizations of some of the more unusual velocity distributions found in this paper . in particular , distributions with velocities that are smaller than the earth s velocity in the galactic frame ( @xmath126  km / s )",
    "could be interpreted in at least two ways .",
    "one is dark matter that streams in a direction parallel to the motion of the sun around the galaxy .",
    "this could be a local stream , or could be a `` dark disk '' .",
    "another interpretation is that the lower velocities arise from dark matter that is weakly bound to the earth / sun / jupiter system . in both cases , relative velocities in the tens , rather than hundreds , of km / s",
    "are physically realizable .",
    "there are still many questions and many interesting avenues for future exploration of astrophysics - independent implications of dark matter .",
    "time - dependence in the scattering rate is perhaps the most important , given the ongoing interest in the annual modulation observed by dama . in the future , directional dependence will also provide an excellent way to determine the nature of the dark matter velocity distribution we find ourselves in .",
    "understanding the particle physics implications of these observations is left to future work . with information about dark matter from other sources , such as mass determinations from the lhc",
    ", the approach presented here could allow the interpretation of direct detection results as a direct measurement of the local astrophysical properties of dark matter .",
    "finally , we have not considered the implications of multiple nuclear recoil spectra from different experiments .",
    "this too is an very interesting and timely subject that we hope to see work on very soon  @xcite .",
    "we thank r.  lang , r.  fok , and l.  strigari for useful discussions .",
