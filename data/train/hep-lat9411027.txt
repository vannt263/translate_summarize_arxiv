    "the partition function for the @xmath1dimensional @xmath2 non  linear @xmath3model is @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the linear extent of the lattice @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the boltzmann factor and @xmath8 is the reduced external field .",
    "the @xmath9component spin @xmath10 has unit modulus . in the case of @xmath11",
    "this is the plane rotator or @xmath0model and has a phase transition at @xmath12 which is caused by the binding and unbinding of vortices .",
    "an approximate renormalization group approach indicates unusual scaling behaviour of the thermodynamic functions as criticality is approached from the disordered phase @xcite . in terms of the reduced temperature @xmath13 , the scaling behaviour of the correlation length , susceptibility and the specific heat is given in @xcite as @xmath14 where for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the aim of this work is to argue that the latter two scaling formulae are incompatible as they stand . to this end",
    ", a method is presented by which odd and even thermodynamic functions ( like ( [ ktchi ] ) and ( [ ktcv ] ) ) can be related and expressed in terms of partition function zeroes . using certain reasonable assumptions regarding finite ",
    "size scaling , it is shown that there have to exist multiplicative logarithmic corrections to ( [ ktchi ] ) and ( [ ktcv ] ) .",
    "this method can be applied to any model .",
    "for the @xmath19model the zeroes in the complex external field strength plane are on the imaginary axis @xcite . expressing the partition function in terms of its lee  yang zeroes ( denoted @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a non - vanishing function of @xmath8 related to the spectral density and contributes only to the regular part of the free energy .",
    "the singular part of the free energy corresponds to @xmath23 this can be written as @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is an appropriate cutoff and the density of zeroes , @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the cumulative density of zeroes .",
    "the distribution of zeroes is symmetric in the real @xmath8axis and the ( cumulative ) density of zeroes is zero up to the yang ",
    "this allows one to write the singular part of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position of the yang ",
    "lee edge .",
    "this leads to an expression for @xmath31 in terms of the cumulative density of zeroes and the edge .",
    "following @xcite this gives ( independent of the model under consideration provided it obeys the lee  yang theorem ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is unknown .",

    "thouless ( kt ) scaling behaviour for the singular parts of the thermodynamic functions : @xmath37 assume , furthermore , the edge scales as @xmath38 putting these in ( [ g ] ) and ( [ c ] ) gives @xcite @xmath39 thus the scaling behaviour of the yang ",
    "lee edge has multiplicative logarithmic corrections even if @xmath31 and @xmath40 have not .",
    "finite  size scaling ( fss ) @xcite allows one to find the volume dependency of thermodynamic quantities at @xmath41 from their thermodynamic limit scaling behaviour .",

    "applying ( [ fss ] ) to ( [ ktchimod ] ) and ( [ tdedge ] ) gives @xmath47 the finite  volume counterpart of ( [ g ] ) , relating the susceptibility and the zeroes , is ( from ( [ free ] ) ) @xmath48 where it has been assumed that the lowest lying zero has the dominant effect .",
    "this gives @xmath49 thus the scaling behaviour of the singular part of the specific heat indeed exhibits multiplicative logarithmic corrections .",

    ", the slope of figure  [ fig : leading ] should give the leading power ",

    "in fact the slope is -1.8777(4 ) , the deviation from the kt value of @xmath65 being due to the presence of logarithmic corrections . to identify these , and the correction exponent @xmath50 in ( [ goal ] ) ,",

    "thus we have strong evidence for a non  zero value of @xmath50 , albeit not in agreement with the rg predictions of @xmath69 from @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments checking the consistency of the scaling behaviour of odd and even thermodynamic functions at a kt phase transition have been presented .",
    "the generally used scaling formulae have to be modified by multiplicative corrections .",
    "these are identified analytically for the specific heat and numerically for the susceptibility .",
    "this numerical identification comes via an analysis of lee  yang zeroes , the fss of which is linked to that of the susceptibility .",
