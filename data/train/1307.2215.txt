    "the description of compton scattering by the nucleon via dispersion theory was developed at the beginning of the 1960s @xcite . the theory made use of relations which may be denoted as @xmath21-channel dispersion relations and @xmath22-channel dispersion relations .",
    "the singularities entering into the @xmath21-channel dispersion relations may be taken from meson photoproduction experiments , whereas the singularities entering into the @xmath22-channel dispersion relations are related to @xmath23 pairs created in two - photon reactions in case of the scalar @xmath22-channel , and to the @xmath24 meson in case of the pseudoscalar @xmath22-channel .",
    "the first application of the scalar @xmath22-channel to the polarizabilities of the nucleon came with the work of j. bernabeu , t.e.o ericson et al .",
    "( beft ) in 1974 @xcite where it was shown that the largest part of the electric polarizability and the total diamagnetic polarizability are due to the @xmath22-channel .",
    "the smaller part of the electric polarizability is due to the `` pion cloud '' showing up as a nonresonant meson photoproduction process .",
    "the paramagnetic polarizability is mainly due to the photoabsorption cross section provided by the @xmath25 resonance .",
    "a convenient version of a dispersion theory applicable in a wide angular interval and at energies up to 1 gev was developed by lvov et al .",
    "this dispersion theory is of the fixed-@xmath22 variety where @xmath21-channel integrals are carried out along integration paths at constant @xmath22 , and the @xmath22-channel contributions are taken care of in the form of `` asymptotic '' contributions , being an equivalent of the @xmath22-channel contributions . in principle",
    "this version of dispersion theory is completely equivalent to other versions as there are fixed-@xmath26 dispersions theories or hyperbolic dispersion theories . at first sight",
    "there appears to be a disadvantage in case of fixed-@xmath22 dispersion theories because the integration paths are partly located in the unphysical range of the scattering plane .",
    "however , it has been shown by lvov et al .",
    "@xcite that this only leads to minor technical problems which can be solved without loss of precision .",
    "the validity of this latter statement has been clearly demonstrated by experiments , showing that fixed-@xmath22 dispersion theories lead to a precise representation of the experimental differential cross sections in the whole angular interval and at energies up to 1 gev @xcite . in this respect",
    "the nonsubtracted dispersion theory differs from the subtracted dispersion theory @xcite which looses validity already at the peak energy of the @xmath27 resonance . for the spin - independent @xmath22-channel contribution",
    "the assumption was made that it is possible to represent it via a scalar @xmath19-meson pole - term , in analogy to the well - known pseudoscalar @xmath24 pole term as entering into spindependent amplitudes . with this representation it was possible to arrive at agreement with experimental data in the angular and energy ranges described above , whereas without this representation of the pole term there remained a large discrepancy between prediction and the experimental data .",
    "this implies that at energies of the second resonance region of the nucleon and large scattering angles the @xmath19-meson pole makes a dominant contribution to the compton differential cross section .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19-meson mass was determined to be @xmath28 mev @xcite in agreement with other available data .",
    "these first investigations published in 2001 @xcite remained preliminary because the @xmath19-meson pole was only an ansatz at that time and there was an uncertainty about its validity .",
    "this uncertainty has been removed in later investigations where it was shown that the @xmath19-meson pole term has a very firm theoretical basis and that the quantitative predictions calculated from well known properties of the @xmath19-meson are precise ( see @xcite for a summary ) . as a conclusion we may state that the dispersion theory of lvov et al .",
    "@xcite is precise and well tested .",
    "therefore , there are good reasons to trust in the evaluations of electromagnetic polarizabilities from low - energy compton - scattering data where use is made of this type of dispersion theory .",
    "this is the case for all experimental data which are summarized in @xcite leading to the _ recommended _ nucleon polarizabilities given in the abstract . for the neutron also electromagnetic scattering of slow neutrons",
    "has been taken into account .",
    "furthermore , these _ recommended _ values are in excellent agreement with independent predictions obtained from high - precision cgln amplitudes @xcite and well - investigated properties of the @xmath19 meson without making use of experimental compton differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "in addition to dispersion theory @xmath29eft plays a prominent rle in current investigations of nucleon compton scattering and polarizabilities .",
    "the present investigation is motivated by the fact that recently @xmath29eft has been used as a tool for analyses of experimental differential cross sections for compton scattering by the proton , and results have been obtained which are considerable different from the well - founded standard values @xmath0 and @xmath30 .",
    "examples are the chpt - investigation of beane et al .",
    "@xcite where the values @xmath31 , @xmath32 have been obtained , and mcgovern et al .",
    "@xcite where @xmath33 , @xmath34 have been obtained .",
    "these values have been included in the data listing of the particle data group @xcite though the magnetic polarizabilities @xmath35 of @xcite deviate from the respective _ recommended _ value @xcite by a factor @xmath36 and the electric polarizability @xmath37 of @xcite by @xmath36 standard deviations .",
    "these new results are based on the same set of experimental data as the previous ones @xcite so that the deviations are solely due to differences in the methods of data analysis .",
    "it is obvious that the new analyses are justified only if they are superior to or at least of the same quality as the previous ones .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to explore whether or not this is the case .",
    "in a recent article @xcite a complete description of the present status of dispersion theory of nucleon compton scattering and polarizabilities has been given .",
    "the _ recommended _ experimental polarizabilities introduced in the 2005 summary @xcite have been confirmed in the 2013 summary @xcite except for a slight correction applied to @xmath38 .",
    "the reason for this slight correction was due to the fact that new high - precision analyses of cgln amplitudes have become available @xcite which made this revision necessary .",
    "these new high - precision analyses @xcite were also of great importance in connection with the prediction of the @xmath21-channel components of the nucleon polarizabilities for all resonant and nonresonant excitation processes of the nucleon . results of these analyses which are of interest here are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".@xmath21-channel electromagnetic polarizabilities compared with experimental data . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ lensky ]    the variants considered in @xcite are as follows : + i : the results for compton scattering with nucleon and @xmath24 born graphs ( tree graphs ) , plus polarizabilities as given by the counterterm ( c.t . ) .",
    "+ ii : tree graphs plus the effects of the ( dressed ) @xmath27 @xmath21- and @xmath39-channel pole graphs .",
    "+ iii : tree graphs plus @xmath20n loops : the @xmath40 calculation in heavy - baryon @xmath29eft without an explicit @xmath27 degree of freedom .",
    "+ iv : as ( iii ) but with relativistic nucleon propagator in the @xmath20n and @xmath41 loops .",
    "+ v : the @xmath42 calculation in heavy - baryon @xmath29eft with explicit @xmath27 , including tree graphs , @xmath27 poles and hb @xmath20n and @xmath41 loops .",
    "+ vi : as ( v ) , but with relativistic nucleon propagators in the @xmath20n and @xmath41 loops .",
    "according to the authors @xcite all of these variants of @xmath29eft are based on the same low - energy symmetries of qcd and in this sense are equivalent .",
    "but only the last two versions v and vi in table [ lensky ] are realistic calculations which can be compared with experimental compton differential cross sections in the resonance region and some way below .",
    "a comparison with experimental data at angles from @xmath43 to @xmath44 shows that these two variants of @xmath29eft which both include the leading @xmath20n loop effects and an explicit @xmath27 are quite similar , provided the counterterms ( c.t . )",
    "are included and adjusted to yield identical values for the scalar dipole polarizabilities .",
    "however , the values found for the two sets of counterterms in the @xmath29eft variants considered here are rather different .",
    "they are particularly large in the @xmath45 calculation ( column v ) , especially as compared to the relativistic @xmath41 one ( column vi ) .",
    "the statements of the authors @xcite cited in the forgoing paragraph indicate that in case of @xmath29efts a major part of the interest is directed to the low - energy symmetries of qcd , whereas the precision of the numbers attributed to the different components of the polarizabilities is of secondary importance .",
    "this attitude contrasts with the aim of the non - subtracted dispersion theory where methods have been developed which lead to a high precision of the different components of the polarizabilities .",
    "for the data analysis certainly high precision is required .",
    "\\(i ) the analysis of compton scattering and polarizabilities in terms of nonsubtracted dispersion relations is precise and well tested experimentally in a large angular range and at energies up to 1 gev . in this respect",
    "the nonsubtracted dispersion theory differs from the subtracted dispersion theory @xcite where the latter looses validity already at the peak energy of the @xmath27 resonance .",
    "+ ( ii ) the polarizabilities of the nucleon are determined from experimental data in two ways , firstly by adjusting the predictions of the nonsubtracted dispersion theory to the experimental differential cross sections for compton scattering in the low - energy domain below the @xmath25 peak and secondly by calculating them from the @xmath21-channel and @xmath22-channel singularities as provided by high - precision analyses of cgln amplitudes and well known properties of the scalar @xmath22-channel . in the latter case",
    "no use is made of compton scattering differential cross sections .",
    "the results obtained by these two methods are in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "the paper of beane et al .",
    "@xcite cited in the introduction is essentially of the variety iii in table [ lensky ] .",
    "the amplitude for unpolarized compton scattering is expanded in powers of the parameter @xmath46 used in efts , representing a typical external momentum . to @xmath47 the polarizabilities",
    "are given by pion - loop effects and lead to the hbchpt prediction . at @xmath48",
    "there are new long - range contributions to these polarizabilities .",
    "four new parameters also appear which encode contributions of short - distance physics to the spin - independent polarizabilities .",
    "thus one needs four pieces of experimental data to fix these four short - distance contributions .",
    "after these adjustment to experimental data have been carried out good fits to experimental differential cross sections have been obtained .",
    "the paper of mc govern et al .",
    "@xcite cited in the introduction includes effects of the @xmath27-resonance and , therefore , essentially is of the variety v in table [ lensky ] .    the foregoing analysis has shown that by `` integrating out '' @xmath18- and @xmath17- degrees of freedom and by using the derivative coupling alone , the @xmath49 component of the electric polarizability predicted by chpt is increased by a factor @xmath50 compared to the correct empirical value .",
    "furthermore , by carrying out the kinematical modifications entering into hbchpt a further increase by a factor of 1.7 ( proton ) and 1.2 ( neutron ) is obtained .",
    "the `` integrating out '' of the @xmath19-meson leads to the omission of the major part , @xmath51 , of the electric polarizability and to the omission of the diamagnetic polarizability @xmath52 .",
