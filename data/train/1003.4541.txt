    "the interior of @xmath5 , as a subset of the @xmath6-character variety , is well - understood ; however , little is known about the topology of entire deformation space and its dependence on the topology of @xmath4 .",
    "we show that there are points where @xmath5 fails to be locally connected when @xmath4 is homotopy equivalent to a closed surface .",
    "the work of ahlfors @xcite , bers @xcite , kra @xcite , marden @xcite , maskit @xcite , sullivan @xcite , and thurston @xcite shows that the components of the interior of @xmath5 are in one - to - one correspondence with the marked homeomorphism types of compact @xmath3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "using the theory of quasiconformal deformations and the measurable riemann mapping theorem , each of these components can be parameterized by analytic information .    unfortunately , our understanding of the interior of @xmath5 does not extend to the entire space .",
    "when the boundary of @xmath4 is incompressible , anderson , canary , and mccullough @xcite characterized when two components of the interior of @xmath5 have intersecting closures .",
    "they called this phenomenon bumping . for any genus @xmath1 surface @xmath0 ,",
    "mcmullen @xcite showed that the interior of @xmath2 self - bumps .",
    "this means that there is a point @xmath7 such that whenever @xmath8 is a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath9 , the intersection of @xmath8 and the interior of @xmath2 is disconnected .",
    "bromberg and holt @xcite generalized this result by showing that whenever @xmath4 contains a primitive , essential annulus that is not homotopic into a torus boundary component of @xmath4 then the interior of @xmath5 self - bumps .",
    "recent work by agol @xcite , calegari and gabai @xcite , brock , canary , and minsky @xcite , and many others has led to a classification of hyperbolic manifolds up to isometry .",
    "the existence of bumping and self - bumping points shows that the invariants used in this classification do not vary continuously at certain points on the boundary of the deformation space ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , further study of the local topology of @xmath5 near these points is necessary in order to fully understand these spaces of hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "bromberg @xcite recently showed that the space of kleinian punctured torus groups is not locally connected .",
    "the points where this deformation space fails to be locally connected are self - bumping points , but he also showed that the space is locally connected at other self - bumping points .",
    "this indicates that bumping may be considerably more complicated than we previously thought .",
    "he also conjectured that @xmath2 would fail to be locally connected for any surface @xmath0 , although his arguments in the punctured torus case made essential use of minsky s @xcite classification of punctured torus groups .",
    "the results in @xcite that bromberg uses do not generalize to higher genus surfaces .",
    "the following theorem proves bromberg s conjecture .",

    "we frequently refer to many of the arguments in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the results in section [ local homeomorphism section ] rely on and/or generalize the results of section 3 of @xcite .",
    "however , since some of minsky s results in @xcite do not extend to higher genus surfaces , we make a significant departure from bromberg s methods in section [ closure not locally connected section ] . in this section , we make use of an improved version of the filling theorem , the key technical result of this paper .    before stating our version of the filling theorem , we will set up some of the notation . given a geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold @xmath10 with a rank-@xmath11 cusp ,",
    "the filling theorem provides sufficient conditions for one to `` dehn - fill '' the cusp .",
    "that is , if @xmath10 is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold @xmath12 with a torus boundary component corresponding to the cusp of @xmath10 , and @xmath4 is a dehn - filling of @xmath12 , then the filling theorem provides conditions for one to construct a hyperbolic manifold @xmath13 homeomorphic to the interior of @xmath4 with the same conformal boundary as @xmath10 . assuming the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied , one obtains a relationship between the metrics on @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",

    "we define a subset @xmath65 and a map @xmath66 and we show there is some @xmath67 and a neighborhood @xmath8 of @xmath68 in @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 is a homeomorphism .",

    "if @xmath76 for some @xmath77 , we use the @xmath78-coordinates to define a marked hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold with @xmath79 rank-@xmath11 cusps .",
    "to each rank-@xmath11 cusp , one can associate a conformal structure on a torus , and @xmath80 acts as a teichmller parameter for the @xmath81th cusp .",
    "we then use the filling theorem ( theorem [ filling ] ) to fill in these cusps and obtain a marked hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold in the interior of @xmath2 .",
    "we define @xmath69 to exclude points in @xmath82 where some , but not all , of the @xmath78-coordinates are @xmath83 .",
    "this parameterization of the subset @xmath84 is a straightforward generalization of the results in section 3 of bromberg @xcite .",
    "we set up the necessary background in section [ background deformation theory ] and describe the parameterization in section [ local homeomorphism section ] .",
    "this parameterization is an application of parts @xmath85 of theorem [ filling ] and corollary [ multiple fillings ] , which is a generalization of the filling theorem for multiple cusps .    in section [ a not loc conn section ] , we use results of section 4 of bromberg @xcite to show that @xmath69 is not locally connected at @xmath86 . moreover , we find that in some neighborhood @xmath8 of @xmath86 in @xmath69 , there exists @xmath87 and subsets @xmath88 accumulating at @xmath86 such that for any @xmath89 and any @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 for all @xmath92 ( see lemma [ lowerboundw ] ) .",
    "heuristically , we think of the sets @xmath93 as being components of @xmath8 that are bounded apart from the rest of @xmath8 by a lower bound that is independent of @xmath92 .",
    "in actuality , these sets are likely collections of components .    finally , in section [ closure not locally connected section ]",

    "we then use the filling theorem to estimate the complex length of a curve in @xmath99 based on @xmath100 .",
    "the control on the @xmath101-coordinate from lemma [ lowerboundw ] and the quality of the estimates in the filling theorem show that for all but finitely many @xmath92 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 must be disjoint .",

    "_ since the point @xmath1111 that we fixed in the beginning of section [ subsection : inverse to phi ] and used throughout sections [ subsection : inverse to phi ] and [ subsection : local homeomorphism ] was arbitrary , we have actually shown that @xmath72 is a local homeomorphism at any @xmath918 .      in proposition [ a not loc conn ] , we saw that there was a point @xmath1111 such that @xmath69 is not locally connected at @xmath68 . by theorem [ loc homeo ] , @xmath72 is a local homeomorphism from @xmath69 to @xmath1246 at @xmath68 .",

    "next we will use the complex length estimates in the filling theorem to produce a contradiction to ( [ lower bound r ] ) . consider the complex length , @xmath1556 .",
