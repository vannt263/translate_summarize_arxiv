    "the understanding and the characterization of the physical properties of frustrated magnetic systems is a central issue in modern theory of condensed matter . indeed , in the last years",
    ", it has become evident that the magnetic interactions can give rise to a large variety of different unconventional phenomena , and that they can also be related to other phases of matter , like , for instance , superconductivity .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", an impressive number of materials with unconventional magnetic properties has been discovered , including quasi - one - dimensional and ladder systems ,  @xcite quasi - two - dimensional compounds with highly frustrated magnetic interactions ,  @xcite systems of weakly coupled dimers in various geometries ,  @xcite and fully three - dimensional frustrated systems based on corner sharing tetrahedra .",
    "@xcite    a particular role in the list of frustrated magnetic systems is played by the magnetoplumbite @xmath1 , in which the anomalous magnetic properties are commonly attributed to planes of @xmath2 ions on the so - called _ kagome _ lattice , a lattice which can be described as a triangular lattice of triangles ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : kagomedimer ] ) . in this compound",
    ", although a small quantity of disorder is present in the chromium planes , there are evidences that the physical properties are not much affected by the presence of impurities .",
    "nonetheless , linear - susceptibility measurements did not find any sign of conventional magnetic order down to @xmath3 ,  @xcite despite a significant antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath4 between @xmath2 ions , deduced from the curie temperature . on the other hand , important insight into",
    "a possible spin - glass phase at very low temperatures comes from the non - linear susceptibility @xmath5 measurements by ramirez and collaborators .",
    "@xcite in usual spin - glass systems , it is known that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spin - glass freezing temperature and @xmath8 is typically between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", it was found that @xmath5 diverges at @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , indicating a possible freezing transition at this temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that the divergence of @xmath5 at a finite temperature indicates the importance of three - dimensional effects , since two - dimensional spin glasses are not expected to order at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , the possibility of a spin - glass behavior in the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model on the _ kagome _ lattice was suggested by chandra and collaborators .",
    "@xcite the _ kagome _ lattice exhibits both frustration and a low coordinance number , and , therefore , the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the _ kagome _ lattice is a good candidate to find unconventional magnetic behaviors at very low temperature .",
    "the most problematic issue in the _ kagome _ antiferromagnet comes from the infinite number of classically degenerate ground states .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , the linear spin - wave spectrum of magnetic excitations possesses a whole branch of zero modes .",
    "@xcite moreover , exact diagonalizations on finite - size systems have shown that the spin - spin correlations decrease very rapidly with distance .",
    "@xcite in addition , the series expansion from the ising limit and high - temperature series point to the absence of magnetic order ,  @xcite whereas , according to large-@xmath13 approaches , the ground state should be disordered with unbroken symmetry .",
    "@xcite    the huge degeneracy of the classical ground states for the _ kagome _ antiferromagnet opens the possibility of the so - called _ order by disorder _ effect .",
    "@xcite indeed , it is known that both thermal and quantum fluctuations can lift classical degeneracies in favor of particular states , which break some symmetry .",
    "examples of this phenomenon are the ordering effect in the antiferromagnetic ising model on the f.c.c . lattice due to thermal fluctuations  @xcite or the establishment of a collinear order in the @xmath14 model due to quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    in particular , thermal fluctuations could be effective to partially lift the classical ground state degeneracy by favoring states with largest entropy . in highly frustrated antiferromagnets , like the _ kagome _ lattice",
    ", the resulting energy landscape could still be very complicated , with many different `` valleys '' separated by high energy barriers , possibly giving the system a spin - glass behavior . in ordinary spin - glass materials ,",
    "the disordered nature of the system gives rise to frustrated magnetic interactions and , therefore , to many topologically different configurations that are energetically equivalent but separated by large ( infinite ) free energy barriers .",
    "the resulting physical properties show peculiar behaviors , with a very slow spin dynamics .  @xcite     the _ trimerized _ _ kagome _ lattice .",
    "the solid and dashed lines indicate the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the numbers 1 , 2 and 3 indicate the site indexing inside the elementary triangles which defines the gauge ( see section  [ model]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for the classical _ kagome _ model with full rotation symmetry in spin space , no evidence in favor of a spin - glass behavior could be found ,  @xcite and it seems that one has to go away from this very minimal model to have a chance to get a spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "since @xmath1 is made of spins 3/2 , it seems natural to turn to the quantum version of the model . in this paper",
    ", we consider an approximate way of including quantum fluctuations into a classical description .",
    "the starting point is the effective hamiltonian obtained in ref .   for the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model on a _",
    "_ kagome _ lattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : kagomedimer ] ) , which contains both spin and chirality variables .",
    "this is a modified version of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model on the _ kagome _ lattice , in which the exchange couplings take two different values @xmath15 and @xmath16 according to the pattern of fig .",
    "[ fg : kagomedimer ] .",
    "it is worth noting that this is actually the relevant case for the description of @xmath1 , since the presence of a triangular lattice between pairs of _ kagome _ layers leads to two kinds of bond lengths .    in ref .  ,",
    "by using an appropriate mean - field approximation , this effective hamiltonian has been useful to explain a number of important properties of the low - lying excitations of the _ kagome _ lattice , in particular the increase of the low - energy singlet states with the number of sites @xmath13 like @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , this effective hamiltonian is far from being fully investigated because the interactions couple the spins and the chiralities in a non - trivial way .",
    "nevertheless , given the very complicated nature of the problem , even at the classical level , the interplay between spins and chiralities can give rise to an unconventional behavior .",
    "in this respect , for any calculation in the true quantum case , it is very important to know the underlying classical states , and , therefore , a first fundamental step is to establish the classical picture .",
    "recently , an interesting step toward the comprehension of the interplay between two different kinds of classical variables has been achieved by using a simple ashkin - teller model on a square lattice .  @xcite it was pointed out that the presence of two local degrees of freedom might be a key element to prevent any kind of long - range order and to obtain a very slow spin dynamics ( reminiscent of a spin - glass - like behavior ) at low - enough temperature .",
    "hopefully , this finding can be seen as a first and crude explanation of the low - temperature behavior of @xmath1 , which does not show any magnetization down to very low temperature , but presents some promising evidence for a spin - glass behavior .",
    "it is also worth noting that , although in @xmath1 the @xmath2 ions have spin @xmath18 , we consider the case treated in ref .  , suitable for @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite    in order to go beyond the simple model considered in ref .",
    ", based on ising variables , and to further clarify the possibility to obtain a spin - glass behavior in a more realistic system that does not contain explicit disorder but only frustration between two distinct local variables , we investigate the effective model of ref .   in the classical limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] , we introduce the model , in section  [ zerofield ] we present the results for the case of zero external magnetic field , in section  [ field ] we present the results of the magnetization in the presence of an external magnetic field , and in section  [ conclusions ] we discuss the results and give our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the effective model obtained in ref .   for the quantum spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the _ trimerized _ _ kagome _ lattice .",
    "in this modified version of the usual spin-@xmath0 _ kagome _ antiferromagnet , the lattice is decomposed such as to emphasize the role of the elementary triangles building the _ kagome _ lattice . indeed , the spins are coupled through two different constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg : kagomedimer ] . in the limit @xmath20",
    ", the lattice can be seen as a triangular lattice of weakly coupled triangles and , by using ordinary perturbation theory , it is possible to derive an effective hamiltonian in the subspace of the ground states of the triangles .",
    "the four - fold degenerate ground state of a triangle can be described by two spin-@xmath0 degrees of freedom , a spin @xmath21 and a chirality @xmath22 . with these variables ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is defined on a triangular lattice of @xmath13 sites and reads :  @xcite @xmath23    [ 1 - 2 ( \\beta_{ij } \\tau_j^- + \\beta_{ij}^2",
    "\\tau_j^+ ) ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the sum over pairs of nearest - neighbor triangles .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the type of bond : they take the values @xmath9 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 [ @xmath29 when the original spins in triangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 involved in the bond ( @xmath32 ) sit at site @xmath9 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 respectively , with the convention of fig .",

    "note that we have the freedom to choose the numbering of the sites within each triangle , and that the convention of fig .",
    "[ fg : kagomedimer ] is different from that of ref .  .",
    "with a little algebra , we write the effective hamiltonian in a more compact way .",
    "indeed , the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be rewritten by introducing @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 hence , @xmath40 , and therefore : @xmath41 the notation is further simplified by introducing three unitary vectors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 : @xmath45    with this notation , the hamiltonian reads : @xmath46 where the vectors @xmath47 are to be chosen among @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . in this hamiltonian",
    ", we treat @xmath51 and @xmath52 as classical vectors with norm @xmath9 and @xmath0 , respectively . by adopting the gauge depicted in fig .",

    "we will see that this leads to a complicated interplay between spins and chiralities and gives rise to a very rich physics in the low - temperature regime .",
    "in this section we present the results of our model when no external magnetic field is applied .",
    "we provide evidences that , for low - enough temperatures , the system undergoes a partial _ order by disorder _ transition to a state where the chiralities are essentially frozen in a given configuration .      in order to investigate the interplay between spins and chiralities , let us first study the low - temperature properties of the system .",
    "this is achieved by performing classical monte carlo simulations using a heat - bath algorithm .",
    "@xcite in the context of our model , the heat - bath algorithm is efficient down to very low temperatures ( @xmath59 ) , and , therefore , it is possible to have insight into very low - energy phases .",
    "the details of this algorithm are discussed in appendix  [ montecarlo ] . for most calculations",
    ", we considered an @xmath60 triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and we checked the conclusions on larger sizes .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , for all temperatures , the physical properties are governed by short - range correlations and , therefore , the @xmath60 lattice is enough to obtain insight into the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first important outcome is that the energy per site converges to @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "the particularly simple value of the ground state energy deserves some further investigation . if we look back at the hamiltonian defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : basichamilt ] ) , we can find several classes of states that have energy @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , when all the chiralities are parallel to a given vector @xmath63 in the @xmath64 plane defined by the vectors @xmath53 , then the two factors involving the chiralities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basichamilt ] ) become equal , leading to a non - negative coupling between the spins , and the energy is minimized by a @xmath65 nel state for the spin vectors .",
    "then , the energy for an @xmath13-site system becomes : @xmath66 _ independently _ of the direction @xmath67 of the chiralities in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "therefore , we obtain a large class of states which have , beside the usual rotational symmetry of the nel state of the spins @xmath21 , an extra continuous symmetry in @xmath22 space .    another important class of states is defined by those configurations that have chiralities anti - parallel to the vectors @xmath53 , independently on each site . in this case , the coupling of one site to four out of its six neighbors vanishes .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath53 is equal to @xmath48 for the bond with two neighbors , @xmath49 with two other neighbors and @xmath50 for the last two bonds ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : triankind ] ) . for any choice of @xmath68 among the three possible @xmath69 ,",
    "the effective magnetic coupling vanishes for the four bonds where @xmath70 since it contains the factor @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , having taken @xmath72 , the effective magnetic coupling with the remaining two neighbors is non - zero only if @xmath73 is equal to @xmath74 . in this case , the effective interaction between the two sites is equal to @xmath16 .",
    "a given site @xmath75 can therefore interact with its neighbors in three different ways .",
    "it might be coupled to two neighbors , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in which case these two neighbors will also be coupled , because they have parallel chiralities and @xmath78 . in that way",
    ", we create a coupled triangle , which is completely disconnected from the rest of the lattice .",
    "the site @xmath75 might also be coupled to one neighbor only , forming a system of two coupled spins .",
    "the third possibility is to have the site completely disconnected from its neighbors .",
    "a typical coupling pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : typicalcouplconf ] .",
    "hereafter , we denote by dimer the system of two coupled spins .",
    "it is worth mentioning that because of the classical nature of the spins , the dimer is a classical object , with gapless excitations , and it has nothing to do with the quantum dimers , which are gapped objects .     generic coupling pattern for random chiralities opposite to the vectors @xmath53 .",
    "notice that , because of the periodic boundary conditions , some of the bonds ( indicated by dashed lines ) connect sites on opposite sides of the lattice.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when the chiralities are opposite to the @xmath53 , the coupling pattern will only exhibit isolated sites , dimers and triangles .",
    "moreover , any of these patterns that one can draw on the triangular lattice can also be achieved by choosing the appropriate chiralities .",
    "having fixed the chiralities , the energy is minimized with opposite spins on the dimers and the energy per spin is @xmath61 ; on an isolated triangle , the sum of the spins needs to be zero , the energy per spin being again @xmath61 ; finally isolated sites do not contribute to the energy .",
    "hence , among the possible configurations of chiralities opposite to @xmath53 , those that do not have isolated spins have the ground state energy per site @xmath61 .",
    "a direct inspection of the chiralities and spins in our monte carlo simulations shows that when the system is cooled down abruptly from infinite temperature , that is by starting at the chosen temperature from a random configuration for the spins and the chiralities , states with no obvious pattern in the chiralities and energy per site @xmath61 are achieved .",
    "therefore , the two particular classes of states described above are only two among many other ground states . on the contrary , by cooling down the system through a finite number of temperatures and letting it thermalize at every step before cooling down to the next nearby temperature , we obtain a configuration with disconnected triangles and dimers . within the heat - bath monte carlo",
    ", this fact strongly indicates the presence of a partial _ order by disorder _ effect : among all the possible ground states , the states with large entropy are selected by thermal fluctuations . in the following , we will describe in more details the entropic selection that appears at low - enough temperature , describing how this transition affects the spin dynamics .      at temperature @xmath79 ,",
    "the monte carlo results show that the chiralities are frozen on each site in the @xmath64 plane opposite to the @xmath53 vectors in such a way as to create a collection of disconnected dimers and triangles .",
    "the selection of this specific class of states can be explained by its large entropy . within each decoupled triangle and dimer ,",
    "the spins are totally free to rotate as long as their sum vanishes _ independently _ of the spins of the other triangles and dimers .",
    "thus , all those states have a huge entropy at low - enough temperature .",
    "it can easily be proved that both for dimers and triangles , every site carries one degree of freedom that does not change the energy .",
    "this point is discussed in more details below in the section devoted to the specific heat . as the system is cooled down slowly ,",
    "these states with largest entropy are selected .",
    "the ground state degeneracy is partially lifted by thermal fluctuations and an entropic _ order by disorder _",
    "effect is observed .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : couplconf ] , we show how the non - zero couplings are typically distributed over the lattice at @xmath80 .",
    "we do not have any evidence that the system prefers to create triangles or dimers : we have performed several simulations starting from different random orientations , and in all cases we have reached a state which contains both triangles and dimers .",
    "the average number of triangles is 17 on an @xmath60 site cluster , and the distribution is peaked around this number with a mean square displacement of 3 .",
    "we suspect that this simply corresponds to the distribution for all coverings of the triangular lattice by triangles and dimers . in any case",
    ", this observation agrees with the fact that , at low temperature , triangles and dimers have the same entropy per site .     typical coupling pattern at @xmath81 :",
    "the solid lines between the sites indicate a non - zero coupling between the spins .",
    "notice that , because of the periodic boundary conditions , some of the bonds ( indicated by dashed lines ) connect sites on opposite sides of the lattice.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to have more insight into this entropic selection , we report the chiralities in the @xmath64 plane for decreasing temperatures in fig .  [ fg : chiralconfcool ] . as the system is cooled down below @xmath82 ,",
    "the chiralities start to display a short - range order in the @xmath64 plane , getting more and more anti - parallel to the @xmath83 vectors . as far as we can tell ,",
    "this cross - over temperature does not depend on the cooling rate , provided it is not too fast .",
    "the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fg : chiralconfcool ] have been obtained after performing @xmath84 sweeps over the lattice at each intermediate temperature starting from a random configuration , but the same behaviors have been observed with different numbers of sweeps .    since the chirality configurations that can be selected by the _ order by disorder _ mechanism form an infinite but _ discrete _ set , one can expect that , once such a state has been reached , the system will somehow be trapped in this state .",
    "this is indeed the case on short time scales .",
    "however , whether this corresponds to a true freezing transition requires a careful study of the low temperature dynamics .",
    "for instance , in 2d models of spin glasses with short range interactions , the actual freezing on arbitrarily large time scales only takes place at zero temperature .",
    "so we now turn to a careful analysis of the low - temperature spin and chirality dynamics .",
    "configuration of the chiralities in the @xmath64 plane for different temperatures.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]      below @xmath85 , spins and chiralities behave very differently .",
    "whereas the chiralities are frozen on short time scales , spins are expected to continue to have a fast dynamics since , once the lattice is decoupled into disconnected dimers and triangles , the spins belonging to each of these elementary building blocks are free to rotate as long as the total spin of the dimer or of the triangle remains zero .",
    "spin - spin and chirality - chirality correlation functions confirm this fact . in fig .",
    "[ fg : corr ] , we show typical non - nearest - neighbor correlations @xmath86 and @xmath87 as a function of the time after the system has reached equilibrium at @xmath88 . throughout , the time unit is one monte carlo sweep over the entire lattice .",
    "indeed , the spin - spin correlation function for non - nearest - neighbors fluctuates wildly on short time scales , while the chirality - chirality correlation function is essentially constant .",
    "by contrast , the spin - spin correlations for a pair of coupled nearest - neighbor sites are fixed to @xmath89 or @xmath90 for dimers or triangles , respectively ( not shown ) .",

    "the different configurations must therefore be separated by large energy barriers and the chiralities remain trapped in a small region of their phase space . a similar behavior is observed in ordinary spin - glass materials , where the spin degrees of freedom are completely frozen below a given temperature and different states are separated by infinite ( in the thermodynamic limit ) energy barriers . in this case",

    "in particular , at low temperature , @xmath94 grows linearly with the number of sites @xmath13 .    by analogy , in our model",
    ", we can define a spin - glass susceptibility for the chirality pseudo - spins : @xmath95 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and try to identify a transition temperature from the high - temperature disordered phase to the low - temperature frozen phase .",
    "it turns out that , like in 2d disordered spin models , the freezing takes place at finite temperatures only for finite time scales , and that the actual phase transition , if any , presumably takes place at zero temperature . to see this ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : chisgtau ] the chirality susceptibility @xmath96 as a function of temperature for different _ experimental _ times @xmath93 , corresponding in this case , to the time we have waited at each temperature during the cooling process . for a given time scale , one can clearly identify two regimes : at high temperatures @xmath97 is very small , due to the dynamical character of the chirality variables , whereas for @xmath98 small enough , there is a clear enhancement of @xmath99 , indicating a frozen dynamics of the chiralities .",
    "however , the temperature at which this change of behavior takes place depends on the time of the simulation . to quantify this dependence ,",
    "we have plotted the freezing temperature @xmath100 at which the susceptibility reaches half the value it will take at zero temperature as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "clearly @xmath100 decreases with @xmath93 , and for times @xmath101 , the two are related by @xmath102 , or equivalently @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this fit shows that , at any temperature , the chirality configuration will change on large enough time scales , and that the process is thermally activated with an activation energy @xmath106 .",
    "this energy can thus be interpreted as the typical free - energy barrier between two configurations selected by the _ order by disorder _ mechanism . as in the model of ref .",
    ", the freezing temperature @xmath100 has only a weak logarithmic dependence on the time scale .",
    "note that these results are not affected by the size ( @xmath60 ) used in the simulation .",
    "indeed we have checked in a number of cases that the conclusions are qualitatively and quantitatively similar for @xmath107 and @xmath108 clusters . in particular , for a given @xmath93 , the temperature @xmath100 does not change upon increasing the size of the cluster .    to summarize , we found that spins and chiralities have very different low temperature dynamics in zero field . at a cross - over temperature @xmath109 , chirality configurations with maximum entropy are selected .",
    "below this temperature , the chirality dynamics is activated with a an energy barrier @xmath110 and it is already extremely slow at @xmath111 , while the spins retain a very fast dynamics down to the lowest temperatures .",

    "whereas for a true phase transition the specific heat diverges at the critical temperature , for freezing phase transitions , like in spin - glass systems , the specific heat exhibits a rather broad peak near the freezing temperature .",

    "each quadratic mode gives a contribution to the specific heat equal to 1/2 in units of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , if both spin and chirality were ordered at low temperature , we would expect the zero temperature specific heat per site to be equal to 2 . according to our picture however , only the chiralities are ordered . in a given configuration that minimizes the entropy ,",
    "each chirality can fluctuate around its reference direction @xmath117 with two quadratic modes corresponding to two orthogonal directions , and its contribution to the specific heat is equal to 1 .",
    "however , within a triangle or a dimer , the spins are free to rotate as long as their sum is equal to zero .",
    "this means that they have zero - energy modes which do not contribute to the specific heat . for a dimer ,",
    "the common direction of the vectors can rotate freely , while the relative direction gives rise to two quadratic modes , so one effectively gets one quadratic mode per spin . in a triangle , if we consider a configuration where the sum of the spins is equal to zero , the orientation of a given spin is arbitrary , which gives rise to two zero - energy modes , and the others are free to rotate around the direction of the first one , which gives a third zero - energy mode .",
    "so we are left with 3 quadratic modes , i.e. one quadratic mode per spin , like in a dimer .",
    "so the spin contribution to the specific heat is 1/2 per site , and the total specific heat per site is equal to 3/2 .",
    "note that the entropy is thus the same for triangles and dimers , as stated above .",
    "the reduction of the spin contribution to the specific heat by a factor 2 is quite remarkable .",
    "this should be compared for instance with the classical heisenberg model on the _ kagome _ lattice , in which case the zero temperature specific heat is reduced from 1 to 11/12 ( see ref . ) .",
    "in the absence of an external magnetic field the chiralities show a behavior reminiscent of spin glasses . in ordinary spin - glass materials ,",
    "the freezing of the degrees of freedom , together with a complicated energy landscape , has consequences on the magnetic properties of the system .",

    "whose temperature range strongly depends on the value of the magnetic field , the magnetization decreases and shows a plateau whose width depends on the actual value of the external magnetic field .",

    "[ fg : magnetvstime2 ] . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the case @xmath79 and @xmath121 .",
    "let us first consider the zfc magnetization .",
    "as long as @xmath128 , the magnetization vanishes and the chiralities are all opposite to the vectors @xmath53 and there are both triangles and dimers in the coupling pattern . when the external magnetic field is turned on , the magnetization reaches the value @xmath145 in about @xmath146 monte carlo steps .",
    "this first very rapid regime corresponds to the spins moving toward the direction of the magnetic field . during this",
    "fast spin dynamics , the chirality does not play any important role in the dynamical process .",
    "indeed , we have verified that @xmath147 is also the magnetization acquired in the first @xmath146 monte carlo steps within a simulations where the chiralities were kept fixed . in the second regime , the magnetization increases very slowly up to its saturation value @xmath144 .",
    "this slow increase is due to the combined dynamics of spins and chiralities , in order to find a compromise to minimize the free energy .",
    "by contrast , within the fc protocol , the system is cooled down in the presence of the external magnetic field and therefore , at the final temperature , the magnetization has already a finite value @xmath148 and the chiralities are no longer in the direction of the basis vectors .",
    "then , by keeping the system at the desired temperature @xmath149 , a very slow increase of the magnetization is observed , similar to the behavior of the second regime of zfc .",
    "the pronounced difference between the zfc and the fc protocols , and more generally an evident _ aging _ effect has already been emphasized in a related , but much simpler classical model containing two different ising variables .",
    "@xcite finding the same kind of behavior in a more realistic hamiltonian demonstrates that this is a robust feature of models with competing variables and frustrating interactions , even in the absence of an explicit disorder like in ordinary spin - glass materials .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the properties of the classical version of an effective hamiltonian for the @xmath19 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a _ trimerized _ _ kagome _ lattice using classical monte carlo methods .",
    "the analysis of this model shows many interesting features , possibly reminiscent of a spin - glass behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the fully frustrated character of the interaction , due to the presence of two kinds of variables on each site , induces a freezing of the chiralities and , in the presence of an external magnetic field , the development of very large time scales for the spins at low temperature .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated that , by a partial _ order by disorder _",
    "effect , for @xmath150 , the states with highest entropy are selected by thermal fluctuations , and the chiralities freeze along particular directions .",
    "this prevents the system from developing any long - range correlations and completely splits the lattice into disconnected dimers and triangles , with antiferromagnetically coupled spins . on each of these elementary entities the spins are free to rotate , as long as they add up to zero .",
    "when the spins are coupled to an external magnetic field and the temperature is sufficiently small , the freezing of the chiralities has a strong effect on the low - temperature spin properties .",
    "first of all , the equilibrium magnetization for small magnetic fields has a clear non - linear behavior , whereas for large enough @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath151 .",
    "the actual magnetic field range for which the non - linear behavior is detected strongly depends upon the temperature .",
    "however , the non - linearity can not be meaningfully casted into a divergent @xmath5 , in contrast to traditional spin glasses .",
    "still , very strong non - linear effects in the magnetization curves are clearly present and point to a spin - glass reminiscent behavior .",
    "secondly , there is a clear difference between the fc and the zfc measurements of the magnetization , typical of spin - glass models .",
    "a difference with ordinary spin - glass systems , representing an original aspect of our results is that the characteristic temperature @xmath152 below which the slow spin response takes place does not coincide with @xmath85 and strongly depends on the external magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath153 . on the other hand , the freezing transition of an ordinary spin glass corresponds to a thermodynamic transition and the freezing temperature is independent of the particular protocol . nonetheless , the very slow spin response to an external magnetic field is typical of ordinary out - of - equilibrium systems , and here it is driven by the freezing of the chiralities . in this respect ,",
    "the richness of our model consists in having two distinct temperatures , i.e. , @xmath85 , which characterizes the entropic selection of chirality configurations , and @xmath134 , which characterizes the establishment of the slow spin dynamics . on the contrary , in the ordinary spin - glass models ,",
    "there is only one characteristic temperature .",
    "so the results we have obtained on the classical version of the effective model of the s=1/2 heisenberg model on the trimerized _ kagome _ clearly show that the interplay of two local degrees of freedom can lead to a very slow dynamics , and to a behavior which is in many respects reminiscent of the spin - glass phenomenology .",
    "one point worth noticing at that stage is that this behavior is , as far as we can tell , independent of the dynamics chosen in the numerical simulations . in particular , we have performed a few simulations with simultaneous updates of spins and chiralities at the same site , and the results were unchanged .",
    "this is a clear improvement over the simplified model of ref .  ,",
    "in which the entropic barriers were related to the dynamics .",
    "the present results suggest that the development of a very slow dynamics is actually a generic feature of models with two local degrees of freedom .",
    "coming back to the experimental evidence in favor of a spin - glass behavior in @xmath1 , the present results are very promising in several respects .",
    "first of all , the model was motivated by physical considerations of the exchange processes in this system , in which the _ kagome _ layers are trimerized . besides , the broken ergodicity which is at the origin of the very slow dynamics is neither related to a specific dynamics nor to disorder but to the presence of two local degrees of freedom , a very natural consequence of the special topology of the trimerized _ kagome _ lattice . in particular , although we started from spins 1/2 , all half - integer spin models on the trimerized _ kagome _ lattice lead to very similar effective models with two local degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite in addition , the characteristic temperature at which large time scales appear is much lower than the coupling constant , again in agreement with @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the spins have a very anomalous response to magnetic field , with a clear difference between field - cooled and zero - field - cooled protocols , while retaining a very fast dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "as far as we know , this is a unique feature of the present model , which could be related to the muon spin rotation observation that only a tiny part of the spins are actually frozen in @xmath1 below the spin - glass transition .",
    "@xcite    there are clear differences however between our model and the properties of @xmath1 .",
    "an obvious one is the specific heat , which is quadratic below the spin - glass transition , whereas in our model it goes to a constant .",
    "this behavior is clearly a consequence of our approximation to treat spin and chirality degrees of freedom as classical variables . given the quasi - two dimensionality of the compound",
    ", one can speculate that a quantum treatment would lead to a @xmath154 behavior of the specific heat for the quadratic degrees of freedom , in agreement with experiments .",
    "this could actually be a natural explanation of this behavior , which is _ not _ the most common behavior in spin glasses , which tend to have a linear specific heat at low temperature . at that stage ,",
    "the main discrepancy between the phenomenology described in the present paper and the experimental results obtained in @xmath1 is the observation of a clear phase transition in this compound with a divergent non - linear susceptibility .",
    "it is likely that a true phase transition would require to include inter - layer coupling , like in disordered models of spin - glasses .",
    "whether including such a coupling can produce a divergent non - linear susceptibility is left for future investigation .",
    "we should also note that the effective model for spins 1/2 has specific features with respect to the effective models for larger half - integer spins .",
    "in particular , the identification of exact ground states does not seem to be possible for larger spins ,  @xcite and the phenomenology of these models might turn out to be different in some respects , although we are confident that the presence of two degrees of freedom will still lead to an anomalous response of the spins to an external magnetic field and to the development of large time scales .",

    "this work has been supported by the swiss national fund and by istituto nazionale per la fisica della materia ( infm ) .",
    "in this appendix , we describe the monte carlo method used throughout our study . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian : @xmath155 where @xmath51 are classical unit spin vectors on the sites of an @xmath13-site lattice and @xmath156 are magnetic couplings .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of this hamiltonian , we have performed monte carlo simulations using the heat - bath algorithm to update the vector directions .",
    "@xcite each spin is assumed to be in contact with a heat bath and is immediately put into a local equilibrium with respect to the instantaneous effective field on it from the nearest neighbor spins : @xmath157 where @xmath158 indicates the nearest neighbors of the site @xmath30 and @xmath159 is the temperature .",
    "the new direction of a given spin is determined by a polar angle @xmath160 and an azimuthal angle @xmath161 relative to @xmath162 , through the following boltzmann distribution : @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "the two angles @xmath160 and @xmath161 are chosen with the use of two random numbers @xmath165 and @xmath166 , uniformly distributed between @xmath167 and @xmath9 .",
    "even though  ( [ eq : dist ] ) is independent of @xmath161 , it is useful to update this variable in order to increase the rate at which the phase space is sampled .",
    "we therefore chose a new @xmath161 with @xmath168 the polar angle @xmath160 is instead obtained by @xmath169 - 1.\\ ] ] it is important to note that the heat bath method does not rely on an accept - reject approach . instead",
    ", the new configuration is already generated with the right probability .",
    "when both spins and chiralities are present in the hamiltonian , the same updating algorithm can be applied to the chiralities . in our simulations",
    ", we consecutively chose a random site on the lattice , updated the spin and then the chirality on another random site .",
    "quantities like the energy or the magnetization where usually calculated after @xmath13 such moves , i.e. , after the system had undergone one monte carlo step per site on average .    because we are working with continuous degrees of freedom and not with discrete variables as in the ising model for example ,",
    "the heat bath algorithm is better suited than the conventional metropolis method . in the metropolis method , at low temperatures ,",
    "one starts rejecting many moves because the system prefers to make small fluctuations about local minima of the energy .",
    "thus , it may be very difficult to reach equilibrium or even to know whether one has reached it .",
    "by contrast , the heat bath method provides an efficient way to reach the actual minimum of the energy because a new vector orientation is obtained every time , at any temperature .",
