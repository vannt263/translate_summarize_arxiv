    "nonlinearity may have a nontrivial effect on energy spreading in extended systems . in regular ,",
    "homogeneous in space media and lattices , nonlinearity can partially block or reduce the linear spreading mediated by waves ( phonons ) , due to creation of localized structures ( solitons , breathers ) .",
    "contrary to this , in systems where there are no propagating linear waves , nonlinearity is the only mechanism responsible for the spreading of initially localized wave packets .",
    "this situation will be addressed in this work .",
    "one of the possibilities to suppress the linear spreading is to introduce disorder in the system .",
    "then , in one and two dimensions , all linear eigenmodes become localized and their spectrum becomes purely discrete , this effect is known as anderson localization ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for recent experimental observations ) . in this case nonlinearity",
    "leads to a weak subdiffusive spreading of the wave packets , as has been demonstrated in one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensions .",
    "it should be noted that these results are mainly based on numerical experiments , while purely theoretical attempts ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) have not been fully successful in explaining numerical observations .",
    "also , by studying chaos properties  @xcite and the possible existence of kam tori  @xcite , some reasoning for a slowing down of spreading has been proposed .",
    "another situation where linear waves are absent are so - called strongly nonlinear lattices  @xcite .",
    "these lattices consist of linear or non - linear oscillators which are coupled to nearest neighbors by nonlinear forces .",
    "the propagating modes here can be nonlinear waves only , typically these waves are compactons  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a lattice is the well - known toy `` newton s cradle ''  @xcite . again ,",
    "disorder in such a lattice blocks the compactons ( if they exist ) and the observed spreading is not a traveling wave phenomenon , but a slow subdiffusive process",
    ".    all the numerical evidence in the cited literature indicates for a subdiffusive spreading of wave packets due to weak chaos .",
    "a natural question is whether this phenomenon can be described phenomenologically as a certain `` universality class '' , similar to successful statistical approaches to problems like percolation and roughening of interfaces . in recent papers  @xcite",
    "such a phenomenological description based on the properties of the nonlinear diffusion equation ( nde ) has been proposed and tested for one - dimensional lattices . here",
    ", we extend this theory to two dimensions , and compare the scaling following from the nde with numerical results from an extensive study on 2d strongly nonlinear lattices .",
    "we emphasize that within this framework we also can investigate spreading in regular lattices , where all oscillators are in resonance .",
    "this is a new , theoretically important case helping to promote the understanding of nonlinear spreading , as here also a theoretical prediction on the spreading exponent is possible .",
    "we start in section  [ sec:2dsnl ] by describing the two - dimensional hamiltonian lattices .",
    "then , in section  [ 2dnde ] , we introduce the two - dimensional nde and deduce the scaling and spreading properties from its self - similar solution .",
    "this is followed by section  [ sec : nr ] with our main results , the comparison of these predictions with the extensive numerical simulations including theoretical predictions of the spreading exponents when possible .",
    "[ sec:2dsnl ] the model considered here is a straightforward generalization of the system considered in  @xcite to two dimensions ; it consists of oscillators with power - law local and interaction potentials described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the positions and momenta of the oscillator at lattice site @xmath3 of a quadratic lattice with nearest neighbor coupling .",

    "parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be set to @xmath12 by rescaling @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the only remaining parameter is the total energy @xmath16 in the system .    for a homogeneous nonlinearity with equal powers @xmath17 , by a proper rescaling",
    ", the energy and the local nonlinear strength can be set to @xmath18 and @xmath10 is the only remaining parameter in this case , describing the relation of the coupling and the local potential .",
    "this possibility to scale the total energy to unity induces the following scaling relation between the energy and the time  @xcite : @xmath19 we will use this result later for comparison with the scaling predictions of nde .     for @xmath20 , @xmath21 at times @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( left to right panels ) .",

    "[ 2dnde ]    the nonlinear diffusion equation ( nde ) was found to give reasonable predictions on the spreading in one - dimensional strongly nonlinear lattices  @xcite .",
    "the general picture one has in mind when assuming the nde to describe spreading states is that the motion of already excited , active , lattice sites is chaotic .",
    "this can be viewed as an intrinsic stochasticity of the motion which allows for new lattice sites to get excited by stochastic driving from the active neighbors .",
    "the chaos , and therefore also the excitation efficiency , gets weaker in the course of spreading , because the energy density decreases .",
    "this effect is accounted for by introducing a density dependent diffusion coefficient , in terms of a simple power - law of the energy density  @xmath38 , inspired from the power - law nonlinearities of the model .",
    "this is the physical argument for employing the nde in nonlinear systems that exhibit some sort of chaotic diffusion .",
    "however , a rigorous derivation is yet to be found and such a calculation is not aimed at in this work .    below , we want to present an even wider applicability of the nde to 2d systems and fully resonant oscillators that has not been investigated before .",
    "it should be noted here already that this understanding of chaotic diffusion as the mechanism of the spreading process does not rely on the presence of disorder .",
    "the disorder is only essential for blocking non - linear waves in such system with purely nonlinear coupling .",

    "the second equation represents the conservation of the total energy .",
    "this density @xmath43 will be compared to the numerical results on the local energy density @xmath44 in the 2d lattices .",
    "the nde possesses a radially symmetric , self - similar solution : @xmath45 with @xmath46 here @xmath47 denotes the radius of the excitation , hence the excitation area of spreading states should follow @xmath48 .",
    "although this solution only solves   for a source term @xmath49 as initial condition , it was found that also quite arbitrary localized initial conditions asymptotically converge towards this self - similar solution  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be viewed as describing the prototypical spreading behavior of the nde .",
    "substituting @xmath50 in the expression for @xmath51 , we find the scaling prediction of the nde for the excitation area : @xmath52 with @xmath42 being an unknown constant at this point . however , for the homogeneous case @xmath17 it is possible to find an analytic prediction for @xmath42 as a function of the lattice nonlinearity @xmath4 as will be presented in section  [ sec : nr ] . moreover , for a regular quadratic local potential @xmath20 , @xmath25 , all oscillators are in resonance and a resonant pertubation analysis gives an analytic prediction for @xmath42 in dependence of the coupling nonlinearity @xmath5 , also shown in the next section .",

    "in conclusion , we have extended the framework of the phenomenological description of energy spreading in strongly nonlinear lattices based on the self - similar solution of the nonlinear diffusion equation to two dimensions . this allowed for studying chaotic diffusion in the absence of disorder",

    "we found that the spreading in such non - linear lattices does show the predicted scaling of the number of excited oscillators with energy and time .",
    "for the regular case there appears to be an additional mechanism that leads to deviations from the expected self - similarity of the field profile , as indicated by a growth of the structural entropy . for disordered potentials , however , the numerical results for this entropy nicely follow the scaling prediction and we conclude that in this case the nde again gives the correct description of the spreading behavior .",
    "we have found that the effective index in the nde for regular lattices ( @xmath130 ) is different from that in the disorderd case ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "our explanation is that in the regular case , a resonant mechanism is mostly responsible for the spreading , as neighboring oscillators have close frequencies .",
    "then from the scaling properties of the reduced hamiltonian which describes the excitation of a new site , we derived a general relation between the power of nde and the nonlinearity index in the lattice  ( [ eqn : h5 ] ) which yields correct values of @xmath132 .",
    "we note that this result is not based on the assumptions of `` strong / weak chaos '' ( cf .",

    "firstly , the excitation times used in  @xcite are a much better quantity to identify such a density dependence due to the different averaging , as also explained there . moreover , in 2d each oscillator has not only one , but two or even three excited neighbors which might surpress the density dependence  @xcite .",
    "however , the exact role of the number of coupled neighbors is to be examined further in later works .",
    "most of the numerical results have been obtained at the cineca sp6 supercomputer under the project hpc - europa2 ( project number 228398 ) , with the support of the european community - under the fp7 `` research infrastructure '' programme .",

    "<S> in nonlinear disordered hamiltonian lattices , where there are no propagating phonons , the spreading of energy is of subdiffusive nature . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the universality class of the subdiffusive spreading according to the nonlinear diffusion equation ( nde ) has been suggested and checked for one - dimensional lattices . </S>",
    "<S> here , we apply this approach to two - dimensional strongly nonlinear lattices and find a nice agreement of the scaling predicted from the nde with the spreading results from extensive numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the scaling works also for regular lattices with strongly nonlinear coupling , for which the scaling exponent is estimated analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this , for the first time , shows that the process of chaotic diffusion in such lattices does not require disorder . </S>"
