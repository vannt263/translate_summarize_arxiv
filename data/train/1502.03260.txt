    "finite - dimensional , so - called qubit models is particularly important for building elements of a quantum computer .",
    "it is known , for example , that cnot gate can be build by nonlinear phase shifts and beam splitters . moreover ,",
    "the universal quantum computer theoretically can be built on the optical elements with the obligatory presence of non - linear ones ( see .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , further bibliography is in the @xcite ) .",
    "if we ignore the decoherence factor , the fast quantum algorithms that outperform any classical can work on optical elements .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to simulate in conventional terms the dynamics of the optical devices .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of a partial description of the dynamics of quantum optical devices , especially of non - linear type .",
    "the main theoretical approach here is jaynes - cummings model - jc ( @xcite ) , serving as the basis in studies of non - linear elements .",
    "despite the fact that this model is based on rwa approximation , the processes of long duration can be modelled in the framework of jc .",
    "the simplest example is rabi oscillations for the subspace of the close energies ; the more general case is quantum revivals ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    the aim of our work is to study quantum revivals that are not reducible to rabi oscillations ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ability to implement scalable quantum computations on the optical devices is based on the lack of such a revival in the case of resonance : the coincidence of atomic and cavity frequencies .",
    "but if there is even a small non - zero detuning between these frequencies , such revivals occur in the subspaces generated by the eigenvectors of different pairs of close energies .",
    "this can create an unexpected obstacles in the work of quantum gates with non - linear elements such as a phase shift , which in terms of fock states has the following form : @xmath0 .",
    "the nature of these obstacles is associated with parasitic resonances that arise due to the commensurability of energy gaps .",
    "revivals and partial ( approximate or for certain types of states ) revivals provide a simple and effective tool for studying the unitary dynamics of quantum ensembles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the revival of individual state @xmath1 in the unitary evolution @xmath2 in time @xmath3 means the existence of a real @xmath4 , for which @xmath5 , or , in terms of density matrices , @xmath6 full revival of the subspace means the existence of a time interval @xmath7 , such that equality ( [ rev ] ) is true for any state @xmath8 in this subspace ( it is enough to require it for any pure state ) .",
    "we take plank constant @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath11 , with eigenvalues @xmath12 , @xmath13 , then the evolution of any pure state has the form @xmath14    and the revival of the state @xmath15 is completely determined by the part of the spectrum of @xmath16 , which corresponds to the minimum subspace generated by the eigenvectors @xmath17 , which contains @xmath18 .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that the subspace is generated by the vectors @xmath17 , such that @xmath19 .",
    "then the condition of the full revival of this subspace is equivalent to the rationality of all numbers @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be irreducible fraction , and @xmath23 is the least common multiple of @xmath24 .",
    "then the time of full revival will be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "therefore practically important parameter - the time of full revival depends on the rationality of quotients of the gaps between the energy levels .",
    "we will work with the qubit model , which basis vectors have the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of photons , @xmath29 denotes the excitation of the atom ( @xmath30 - ground state , @xmath31 - excited state ) .",
    "hamiltonian of the model jc has the form @xmath32 in matrix form , with the lexicographical ordering of the basis vectors , the hamiltonian is block - diagonal matrix , where on the main diagonal stands @xmath30 at first , and then blocks of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the frequency of the atom , @xmath35 is the frequency of the cavity , @xmath36 is small detuning , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the matrix element of dipole momentum of the passage from ground state of atom to the excited state , @xmath39 denotes the number of the box .",
    "each box thus corresponds to the two dimensional subspace , which we denote @xmath40 .",
    "full revivals of this subspace take place for every value of @xmath41 , there are well known rabi oscillations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now consider a pair of subspaces @xmath42 .",
    "we intend to find such parameters @xmath43 , for which there is a full revival of the linear span @xmath44 of these subspaces .",
    "this is not the revival of rabi type , but the nontrivial resonance effect between different pairs of energy levels .",
    "spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath45 , restricted to the subspace @xmath46 , is the set consisting of two pairs of real numbers    @xmath47    we introduce the notations @xmath48 .",
    "then , taking fractions of energy gaps , as described above , we find that the full revival of the subspace @xmath46 is equivalent to the rationality of two numbers @xmath49 in case of the resunance ( @xmath50 ) , subtracting these fractions we come to the rationality of the fraction @xmath51 , that is impossible .",
    "we now consider the non - resonance case , when @xmath52 .",
    "for rationality of ( [ frac ] ) it is sufficient that the both roots @xmath53 and @xmath54 are rational , because choosing @xmath55 , we can guarantee rationality of the both fractions .",
    "rationality of these roots is ensured by the presence of rational roots of the equation @xmath56 .",
    "one of this roots is integer : @xmath57 . to search for a dense set of roots we present them as the intersection of the target hyperbola with the line of the form @xmath58 , passing through the integer solution found . expressing variables via the parameter @xmath59 , which we assumed to be rational ,",
    "we obtain a dense set of solutions : @xmath60    since jaynes - cummings model itself is an approximation ( about the revival with the members of the counter - rotating terms , i.e. without rotating wave approximation , see , for example , @xcite ) , the time of full revival @xmath61 is significant . since the physical value @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath34 , we can conclude that roughly @xmath61 is inversely proportional to the number @xmath39 , designating a highest energy level of considered pairs of subspaces .",
    "more subtle dependence @xmath61 from our parameters @xmath63 is complex , because @xmath64 will increase with the growth of the least common multiple of the denominators of the irreducible representations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "the density distribution of this quantity @xmath67 behaves quite erratically ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "for a couple of energy level pairs that are not adjacent , the revival in the linear span of the subspaces is more sophisticated .",
    "here it is sufficient to find rational solutions of the equation @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the distance between pairs of energy levels .",
    "such solutions are known to exist , if @xmath70 for some integer @xmath71 , or for values @xmath72 , which are junior members of the pythagorean triples , that is represented in the form @xmath73 for the integer @xmath74 .    for a set of @xmath75 pairs of energy levels located at distances @xmath76 full revival of the linear span",
    "can be reduced to systems of equations in rational numbers of the form @xmath77 . for @xmath78 we can specify a number of partial solutions for such numbers @xmath76 , which are part of pythagorean triples .",
    "for example , a solution of @xmath79 can give such @xmath66 , which are part of pythagorean triples , as a highest member , and as a junior as well ; examples of such numbers : @xmath80 .",
    "this suggests a rich set of revivals for the three pairs of energy levels simultaneously . on the other hand , for some @xmath76 this task may not have a solution . in general , for a non - zero detuning",
    ", the problem of finding the full revivals is reduced to finding rational solutions of systems of algebraic equations .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the solution of diophantine equations ( 10-th hilbert problem ) , for which there is no algorithmic solution ( see .",
    "we have established the presence of revivals of non rabi type for jaynes - cummings model in subspaces generated by adjacent pairs of energy levels .",
    "such revivals take place only for a non - zero detuning between the frequency of the atom and the cavity .",
    "this revival type is connected with specific resonance arising between two adjacent pairs of energy levels .",
    "this type of resonance can be an obstacle in the non - linear optical quantum devices , which are used to construct quantum gates .",
    "in particular , the presence of a small detuning can lead to a fundamental limitation of the accuracy of quantum operations .",
    "however , such revival we can try to use also to improve the reliability of optical gates .",
    "the set of parameters that provide non rabi revival is dense in the space of all parameters ; this set is obtained by solving the algebraic equations of the second order in rational numbers .",
    "finding more complex types of revivals in this model is reduced to the solution in rational numbers of systems of nonlinear algebraic equations that has no algorithmic solution .",
    "certain combinations of parameters ensure full revival for some pairs of not adjacent pairs of energy levels , for example , for some troikas of such pairs .",
