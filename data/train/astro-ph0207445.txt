    "correlations between the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters are useful statistical tools which allow to study the cluster physics .",
    "the best - studied correlation for the low - redshift clusters is that of the x - ray luminosity with the temperature ( e.g. , mushotzky 1984 , david et al .",
    "1993 , markevitch 1998 , arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "the mass of the intracluster gas correlates with both temperature ( mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 , vikhlinin , forman & jones 1999 ) and x - ray luminosity ( voevodkin , vikhlinin & pavlinsky 2002b ) .",
    "the observed tightness of these correlations indicates a similar formation history for all clusters and is consistent with the predictions of the self - similar models of the cluster formation .    however , the details of these scaling relations are different from the predictions of the self - similar theory .",
    "the best - known example is the slope of the @xmath6 correlation : it is observed that @xmath7 for hot clusters ( e.g. , markevitch 1998 ) , while theory predicts @xmath8 ( e.g. , kaiser 1981 ) .",
    "such deviations may be due to non - gravitational processes such as preheating ( e.g. , cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1997 ) or radiative cooling and feedback from star formation ( voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "observing the evolution of scaling relations can provide useful constraints on such models .",
    "the scaling relations at high redshift also are of great value for cosmological studies based on cluster evolution .",
    "they provide the means to convert an easily observed x - ray luminosity function into the more cosmologically useful temperature or mass functions ( e.g. , borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "most of the previous high redshift studies have focused on the @xmath6 relation .",
    "mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) analyzed a large sample of distant clusters observed with asca ( most at @xmath9 , with a few at @xmath0 ) and found no evidence for evolution in the @xmath6 relation .",
    "several results for a small number of distant cluster observed by _",
    "chandra _ have been published recently .",
    "borgani et al .  (",
    "2001 ) analyzed a sample of 7 clusters at @xmath10 and concluded that the data allow at most a very mild evolution  if the luminosity for the given temperature is @xmath11 , then @xmath12 .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by holden et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from an analysis of 12 clusters at @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath6 relation at both low and high redshifts has a large intrinsic scatter , comparable to the expected evolutionary effects .",
    "the scatter in the low - redshift @xmath6 relation is significantly reduced when the central cooling regions of the clusters are excised from both the luminosity and temperature measurements ( fabian et al .",
    "1994 , markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to exclude the cooling cores in the distant clusters because this too may reduce the scatter and thus more easily expose any evolution .",
    "this task is feasible only with the _ chandra _ s arcsecond angular resolution .    as of spring 2002 ,",
    "_ chandra _ had observed 22 clusters at @xmath0 with sufficient exposure for accurate temperature measurements .",
    "most of this sample is derived from flux - limited x - ray surveys : 7 clusters from the emss ( henry et al .",
    "1992 ) , 11 from the _ rosat _ serendipitous surveys , 160 deg@xmath14 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) , rdcs ( rosati et al .  1998 ) , warps ( ebeling et al .",
    "2000 ) , and 2 from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey .",
    "we use these _ chandra _ observations to derive correlations between the x - ray luminosity , temperature , and gas mass at @xmath0 .",
    "we use @xmath15  km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 throughout .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,^ \" , ]     for other cosmologies ,",
    "the power law slopes in the relations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 can be approximated by interpolating over @xmath20 .",
    "uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level for a single parameter .",
    "we have used _ chandra _ observations of a sample of 22 distant , @xmath0 , clusters to show that the correlations between the cluster temperature , luminosity , and gas mass evolve significantly with respect to the low - redshift relations .",
    "our detection of significant evolution in the @xmath6 relation appears to contradict some other recent _ chandra _ studies ( borgani et al .",
    "2001 , holden et al .",
    "the difference between their and our results can be traced mostly to a more consistent comparison of the high- and low - redshift samples , such as exclusion of the cool cores and extraction of the luminosities in the 2  mpc aperture .",
    "note that the results of novicki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who self - consistently use _ asca _ data for the nearby and distant clusters , agree well with our @xmath6 evolution .",
    "it is theoretically expected that within clusters , the baryon contribution to the total mass , @xmath21 , should be close to the average value in the universe ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "this notion continues to gain observational support ( most recently , allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "if @xmath21 is indeed constant , the evolutions in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 relations involving the gas mass or total mass should be identical .",
    "the observed evolution of the cluster @xmath24 correlations indicates that clusters at high redshift were systematically denser than at present  hotter and more luminous for a given mass , as expected in a theory of the hierarchical self - similar formation .",
    "however , the details of the observed evolution contradict the self - similar predictions .",
    "for example , the standard theory ( e.g. , bryan & norman 1998 ) predicts that for a given temperature , the product @xmath25 should be constant , where @xmath26 is the mass measured within the radius of the overdensity @xmath27 with respect to the critical density at redshift @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the hubble constant . for the realistic cluster density profiles , this implies that approximately @xmath30 in almost any cosmology , where @xmath31 corresponds to the mean overdensity @xmath32 relative to the average density at redshift @xmath28 .",
    "however , we observe little evolution in the @xmath33 relation for the currently favored @xmath1 , @xmath2 cosmology , seemingly at odds with the theoretical prediction .",
    "this possibly indicates the importance of non - gravitational processes for heating the intracluster gas that would change @xmath34 but are unlikely to modify @xmath35 , just as is inferred from the scaling relations for low - redshift clusters ."
