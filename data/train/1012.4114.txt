    "entanglement has been recognized in the past decade as a useful resource in quantum information processing  @xcite . very recently , it has emerged as an actor on the nearby stage of quantum many - body physics , especially for systems that exhibit quantum phase transitions  @xcite , where it can play the role of a diagnostic of quantum correlations .",
    "quantum phase transitions  @xcite are transitions between qualitatively distinct phases of quantum many - body systems , driven by quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is conventionally defined as the non - analyticity in the ground - state energy  @xcite . in view of the connection between entanglement and quantum correlations",
    ", one anticipates that entanglement will furnish a dramatic signature of the quantum critical point as the ground - state wavefunction itself should also exhibit certain non - analyticity , which thereby manifests in the singularity of correlations . to describe",
    "the ground state usually requires exponentially many parameters , and therefore to detect the non - analyticity hidden in the wavefunction may require an ingenious design of observables .",
    "ground - state energy is usually such a good indicator but it may fail to exhibit singularity , for example , near the isotropic antiferromagnetic point in the xxz model  @xcite , where there is a continuous transition .",
    "entanglement is thus expected to be an alternative , useful quantity in assisting the determination of quantum phase transitions , complementing traditional methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the more entangled a state is , usually , though not necessarily , the more useful it is likely to be a resource for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to study and quantify the degree of entanglement near quantum phase transitions . by employing entanglement to diagnose many - body quantum states",
    "one may obtain fresh insight into the quantum many - body problem  @xcite .    to date",
    ", progress in characterizing and quantifying entanglement has taken place greatly in the domain of bi - partite systems , and much understanding has be gained in the multi - partite settings , although a complete picture has not yet been achieved  @xcite .",
    "much of the previous work on entanglement in quantum phase transitions has been based on bi - partite measures , i.e. , focus has been on entanglement either between pairs of parties  @xcite or between a part and the remainder of a system  @xcite . for multi - partite systems",
    ", however , the complete characterization of entanglement requires the consideration of multi - partite entanglement , for which a consensus measure has not yet emerged .    singular and scaling behavior of entanglement near quantum critical points was discovered in important work by osterloh and co - workers  @xcite , who invoked wootters _ bi - partite _ concurrence  @xcite as a measure of entanglement .",
    "the success of the use of concurrence has been understood via its connection to two - point correlation functions and the derivative of ground - state energy  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of concurrence is that it can deal with only two spins ( each with spin-1/2 ) even though the system may contain an infinite number of spins .",
    "although attempts have been made to generalize concurrence to many spin-1/2 systems via the time reversal operation , the generalized concurrence loses its connection to the entanglement of formation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of concurrence may give rise to spurious transition points  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to consider the von neumann entropy of a subsystem of @xmath1 spins with the rest @xmath2 spins of the system .",
    "it is found that for critical spin chains the entropy scales logarithmically with the subsystem size @xmath1 for @xmath3 , with a prefactor that is related to the central charge of the corresponding conformal theory  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement addressed in this case is only between a subsystem and the rest of the system , and the connection to central charge is interesting .",
    "a different approach without using entanglement is to consider fidelity or overlap between two different ground - state wavefunctions , which is now called fidelity measure .",
    "non - analytic behavior in the fidelity measure is expected for system parameters close to critical points .",
    "this approach has been shown to be successful  @xcite .",
    "recently , barnum and co - workers  @xcite have developed an entanglement measure , which they call generalized entanglement . instead of using subsystems they use different algebras and generalized coherent states to define the entanglement .",
    "they have also applied the generalized entanglement to systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions .",
    "their approach opens a new approach to multi - partite entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , there is no _ a priori _ choice of which algebra , amongst all possible ones , is the most natural one to use .",
    "in addition to spin chains other models that have been studied by using either the von neumann entropy ( also known as entanglement entropy ) or the concurrence as the entanglement measure include : ( i ) the super - radiance model , in which many two - level atoms interact with a single - mode photon field  @xcite ; and ( ii ) the one - dimensional extended hubbard model , in which electrons can hop between the nearest neighbors and there are coulomb interactions among electrons on the same site and with nearest - neighbor electrons as well  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in addition to spin systems , entanglement entropy has been examined in both bosonic and fermionic systems  @xcite and the area law ( or the breaking of it ) has been investigated . in view of other approaches that connect quantum information ideas to condensed matter settings ( or vice versa ) , verstraete and co - workers  @xcite have defined an entanglement length , viz .",
    ", the distance at which two sites can establish a pure - state entanglement at the cost of measuring all other sites . they found that this entanglement length is lower bounded the correlation length",
    "all these , including the theme of the present paper , are aimed at approaching many - body problems from different , and hopefully fresh , perspectives , and at complementing traditional statistical - physical approaches .    in the present paper , we expand and extend results of ref .",
    "we apply the _ global _ geometric measure that we have developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a geometric picture  @xcite ; it provides a _ holistic _ , rather than bi - partite , characterization of the entanglement of quantum many - body systems .",
    "our focus is on one - dimensional spin systems , specifically ones that are exactly solvable and exhibit quantum criticality .",
    "the geometric measure has been applied to many models in one dimension  @xcite as well as two dimensions  @xcite and seems to become a useful tool as well . for these systems , it is found that entanglement behaves in a singular manner near the quantum critical points .",
    "this supports the view that entanglement  the non - factorization of wave functions  reflects quantum correlations .",
    "this will be explained in detail using the transverse - field xy models as an specific example .",
    "the remaining structure of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : diag ] , we diagonalize the hamiltonian , invoking jordan - wigner and bogoliubov transformations .",
    "we carefully explain the boundary conditions placed on the spin and hence the fermionic operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : overlap ] , we derive the overlap of the lowest two levels with an ansatz product state , the result of which is the basis for deriving entanglement for these two states , including the true ground state .",
    "section  [ sec : entmain ] contains the main results of the present paper .",
    "we present the results of ground - state entanglement over the entire phase diagram . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : finite ] , we illustrate the entanglement results for finite systems . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : infinite ] , we derive the expression of entanglement for infinite systems .",
    "there , the divergence of ground - state entanglement is analyzed and the connection to the universality classes is established . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : disorder ] , we show the vanishing of entanglement along the disorder line by demonstrating the ground space is doubly degenerate and spanned by two product states . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : superposition ] , we discuss the issue of entanglement superposition , and argue the irrelevance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the determination of ground - state entanglement density . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : finite - size ] , we study the issue of finite - size effect to the entanglement density at criticality . finally , we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] , and give a generic picture of how entanglement behaves near criticality , using a scaling hypothesis .",
    "how the geometric entanglement serves to detect non - analyticity of ground - state wavefunction is also discussed .",
    "we quickly review the global measure that we shall use in the present paper . consider a general , @xmath4-partite , normalized pure state : @xmath5 . our scheme for analyzing",
    "the entanglement involves considering how well an entangled state can be approximated by some unentangled ( normalized ) state ( e.g. ,  the state in which every spin points in a definite direction ) : @xmath6 .",
    "the proximity of @xmath7 to @xmath8 is captured by their overlap ; the entanglement of @xmath7 is revealed by the maximal overlap  @xcite @xmath9 the larger @xmath10 is , the less entangled is @xmath7 .",
    "( note that for a product state , @xmath10 is unity . )",
    "if the entangled state consists of two separate entangled pairs of subsystems , @xmath10 is the product of the maximal overlaps of the two .",
    "hence , it makes sense to quantify the entanglement of @xmath7 via the following _ extensive _ quantity  @xcite @xmath11 this normalizes to unity the entanglement of epr - bell and @xmath12-party ghz states , as well as giving zero for unentangled states .",
    "finite-@xmath12 entanglement is interesting in the context of quantum information processing . to characterize the properties of the quantum critical point we use the thermodynamic quantity @xmath13 defined by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the _ entanglement density _ ,",
    "i.e. , the entanglement per particle .    for translation",
    "invariant state , it is shown that the entanglement is either completely in a product state or is globally entanglement  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the above quantification of entanglement by comparing to product states makes a natural choice .",
    "we remark that by appropriate partitioning of @xmath16 into various product forms , a hierarchy of entanglement can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "this hierarchical geometric measure has recently also been applied to the xy model  @xcite .",
    "one can generalize the form of product states , e.g. , to a product of blocks of two spins ( or multiple spins ) , and then calculate the entanglement per block  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this approach enables the connection of the spatial renormalization group ( rg ) ( i.e. , coarse - graining ) procedure to the geometric measure , and the entanglement under rg can be properly defined  @xcite .",
    "we consider the family of models governed by the hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 measures the anisotropy between @xmath19 and @xmath20 couplings , @xmath21 is the transverse external field , lying along the @xmath22-direction , and we impose periodic boundary conditions , namely , a ring geometry . at @xmath23",
    "we have the isotropic xy limit ( also known as the xx model ) and at @xmath24 , the ising limit .",
    "all anisotropic xy models ( @xmath25 ) belong to the same universality class , i.e. , the ising class , whereas the isotropic xx model belongs to a different universality class .",
    "xy models exhibit three phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xyent10000 ] ) : oscillatory , ferromagnetic and paramagnetic .",
    "in contrast to the paramagnetic phase , the first two are ordered phases , with the oscillatory phase being associated with a characteristic wavevector , reflecting the modulation of the spin correlation functions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we shall see that the global entanglement detects the boundaries between these phases , and that the universality class dictates the behavior of entanglement near quantum phase transitions .",
    "before we solve the entanglement of the xy model , we give perturbative analysis of , as an illustration of how entanglement arises and vanishes , the ising model in a transverse field ( viz .",
    "@xmath24 ) @xmath26 at @xmath27 the ground state is that with all spins pointing up in the @xmath19-direction @xmath28 or down @xmath29 , which is manifestly unentangled . the ground state can be any superposition of @xmath30 and @xmath29 when the @xmath0 symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "for example , the states @xmath31 are actually the two lowest levels obtained from solving the models using jordan - wigner and bogoliubov transformations and they both have @xmath32 .",
    "( for small @xmath21 the entanglement rises quadratically in the case of unbroken symmetry instead of quartically , as we shall show shortly . )",
    "we shall see later that whether or not we use a broken - symmetry state has no effect in the thermodynamic limit . for small @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) one can obtain the ground state by treating the @xmath34 terms as perturbations .",
    "take the ground state at @xmath27 to be @xmath28 .",
    "then first - order perturbation theory for the ground state gives @xmath35 using the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath36 to leading order in @xmath21 . at @xmath37 the ground state is a quantum paramagnet with all spins aligning along the external field : @xmath38 , and once more is unentangled . to @xmath39 perturbation theory",
    "gives ( treating @xmath40 terms small ) @xmath41 for which @xmath42 , to leading order of @xmath43 .",
    "the quantum phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase occurs at @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the two lowest levels , which we denote by @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( for reasons to be explained later ) are , respectively , the ground and first excited states , and they are asymptotically degenerate for @xmath47 when @xmath3 .",
    "as is well known  @xcite , the energy eigenproblem for the xy spin chain can be solved via a jordan - wigner transformation , through which the spin degrees of freedom are recast as fermionic ones , followed by a bogoliubov transformation , which diagonalizes the resulting quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation that we shall make from spins ( @xmath48 s ) to fermion particles ( @xmath49 s ) is    @xmath50    one has to pay attention to the boundary conditions that are to be imposed on the @xmath49 s . although periodic in the @xmath48 s , one can not simply take @xmath51 and conclude that either ( i )  @xmath52 and @xmath53 , or ( ii )  @xmath54 and @xmath55 , neither of which are correct if one wishes to obtain the correct spectrum and eigenstates for arbitrary finite @xmath12 . instead one should impose that ( as the @xmath56-th site is identified as the first site ) @xmath57 which then leads to @xmath58 the two possible conditions that satisfy this are either ( i )  @xmath54 and @xmath53 , or ( ii )  @xmath52 and @xmath55 .",

    "<S> the entanglement in quantum xy spin chains of arbitrary length is investigated via the geometric measure of entanglement . the emergence of entanglement is explained intuitively from the perspective of perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the model is solved exactly and the energy spectrum is determined and analyzed in particular for the lowest two levels for both finite and infinite systems . </S>",
    "<S> the overlaps for these two levels are calculated analytically for arbitrary number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement is hence obtained by maximizing over a single parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ground - state entanglement surface is then determined over the entire phase diagram , and its behavior can be used to delineate the boundaries in the phase diagram . for example , the field - derivative of the entanglement becomes singular along the critical line . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the divergence is derived analytically and it turns out to be dictated by the universality class controlling the quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the entanglement near criticality can be understood via a scaling hypothesis , analogous to that for free energies . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement density vanishes along the so - called disorder line in the phase diagram , the ground space is doubly degenerate and spanned by two product states . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement for the superposition of the lowest two states is also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the exact value of the entanglement depends on the specific form of superposition . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the thermodynamic limit the entanglement density turns out to be independent of the superposition . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that the entanglement density is insensitive to whether the ground state is chosen to be the spontaneously @xmath0 symmetry broken one or not . </S>",
    "<S> the finite - size scaling of entanglement at critical points is also investigated from two different view points . </S>",
    "<S> first , the maximum in the field - derivative of the entanglement density is computed and fitted to a logarithmic dependence of the system size , thereby deducing the correlation length exponent for the ising class using only the behavior of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> second , the entanglement density itself is shown to possess a correction term inversely proportional to the system size , with the coefficient being universal ( but with different values for the ground state and the first excited state , respectively ) . </S>"
