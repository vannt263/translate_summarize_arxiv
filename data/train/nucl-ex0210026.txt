    "the suppression of high @xmath2 hadron production at @xmath1 = 130 gev observed by both the phenix and star collaborations provided the first experimental signatures potentially related to partonic energy loss in the dense nuclear medium produced in rhic collisions@xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of the @xmath2 dependence of the nuclear modification factor , @xmath4 , suggest that an interplay of nuclear gluon shadowing , cronin enhancement and partonic energy loss in a dense medium will cause the suppression to saturate at a finite value@xcite . above a certain @xmath2 threshold , @xmath4 may increase slowly with @xmath2 toward the binary scaling limit predicted by perturbative qcd@xcite . the new star data on charged hadron spectra in au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev , which extend to @xmath2 = 12 gev / c , address these predictions and present an important constraint on theoretical descriptions of high @xmath2 phenomena in nuclear collisions .",
    "the data at @xmath1 = 200 gev were taken during the second rhic run in 2001 using the star detector .",
    "the minimum bias dataset , corrected for vertex finding efficiency , contains 97 @xmath5 3% of the total geometric cross - section for au+au collisions , assumed to be 7.2 barns . for this analysis , 2.7 m minimum bias and 2.1 m",
    "central triggered au+au events were used .",
    "event centrality classes corresponding to percentiles of the total cross - section were determined using the charged particle multiplicity within @xmath6 0.5 .",
    "charged particles are detected in the tpc and their momentum is measured through their curvature in the 0.5 tesla magnetic field .",
    "the high @xmath2 analysis is restricted to long tracks ( @xmath7 20 measured track points ) with @xmath6 0.5 whose projected distance of closest approach to the primary event vertex falls within 1  cm of the measured vertex .",
    "80 mm     [ fig : spectra ]    tracking performance at high @xmath2 was assessed by embedding simulated tracks into real data events . for the 0 - 5% most central events , the efficiency and acceptance for tracks having @xmath8 3 gev / c and @xmath6 0.5 are uniform as a function of @xmath2 at approximately 80% , with a small dependence on pseudorapidity of @xmath5 3% .",
    "for the 40 - 80% most peripheral events , the efficiency is higher due to lower track density , and is 90% above @xmath2 = 3 gev / c and independent of @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "momentum resolution in the 200 gev dataset is a factor of 3 better than that in the 130 gev dataset@xcite .",
    "the dominant backgrounds in the high @xmath2 spectra are from weak decays of @xmath10 and @xmath11 particles and apparent high @xmath2 tracks from @xmath12 and @xmath13 annihilation in detector material .",
    "background corrections are estimated using hijing events in a geant simulation of the detector , with the parent @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 distributions from hijing scaled to match star measured yields and slopes at @xmath1 = 130 gev , corrected for the @xmath1 dependence of particle production .",
    "the backgrounds are estimated to be less than 10% for @xmath8 3 gev / c . however , due to the uncertainty in the yields of @xmath10s and @xmath11s at high @xmath2 , the background corrections above @xmath2 = 3 gev / c are assigned 100% uncertainty .",
    "the systematic uncertainties assigned to the spectra are determined by combining the uncertainties from the momentum resolution correction , the background subtraction and variations in the spectra for different sets of quality cuts and corrections .",
    "the charged hadron @xmath2 spectra for @xmath0 12 gev / c are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , with the non - central bins scaled for clarity .",
    "the limits of the bins in @xmath2 are indicated at the top of the figure by the hash marks , with the highest @xmath2 bin having the range 10 @xmath3 12 gev / c .",
    "80 mm     [ fig : centperiphratio ]    to explore the pattern of hadron suppression to the highest @xmath2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : centperiphratio ] compares the binary - collision scaled star central 0 - 5% spectrum to the 40 - 60% ( top panel ) and the 60 - 80% ( lower panel ) spectra .",
    "the preliminary 200 gev data are shown as black circles , while the star results at @xmath1 = 130 gev@xcite are shown as open diamonds .",
    "the vertical error bars represent statistical and systematic uncertainties in the central 0 - 5% spectra , while the caps show the quadrature sum of these uncertainties with the uncertainties associated with the peripheral reference spectrum .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the mean number of binary collisions , @xmath14 , and the mean number of participant nucleons , @xmath15 , obtained from a monte carlo glauber model of the nuclear overlap , with their uncertainties shown as the gray boxes .",
    "the suppression pattern is similar at the two beam energies , showing an increasing suppression as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath2 = 2 - 6 gev / c .",
    "the 200 gev data , which extend to @xmath2 = 12 gev / c , show that the suppression for central collisions saturates and is approximately constant above @xmath2 = 6 gev / c .    the nuclear modification factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the nuclear overlap integral , depends on the knowledge of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) reference spectrum . a power law parameterization ( @xmath18 ) of the ua1 measured charged particle spectrum from @xmath19 collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev@xcite",
    "is used to construct @xmath4 .",
    "the parameterization was corrected for the larger ua1 @xmath20 acceptance ( @xmath6 2.5 ) as in@xcite .",
    "since power law fits can not be meaningfully extrapolated beyond the range constrained by data , we restrict @xmath4 analysis to @xmath0 6 gev / c .",

    "the error bars are similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : centperiphratio ] . plotting this ratio on a log scale separates the evolution of the shape of the measured suppression from the uncertainties in the geometric scaling and the reference spectrum .",
    "the shape of the suppression is seen to evolve smoothly as a function of centrality , with no evidence of a threshold for the onset of suppression@xcite .",
    "the magnitude and evolution of @xmath4 at @xmath1 = 200 gev is consistent with that observed in @xmath1 = 130 gev au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of charged particle production at midrapidity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rootsratio ] .",
    "the error bars represent the combination of statistical uncertainties in the numerator and the total uncertainty ( statistical + systematic ) in the denominator .",

    "the high @xmath2 behaviour is consistent with the pqcd expectation .",
    "the combination of these results with the @xmath1 dependence of the high @xmath2 charged hadron azimuthal anisotropy@xcite and the high @xmath2 two - particle correlations@xcite observed by star , suggests a picture of strong absorption in the bulk and surface emission of hard scattering products .",
