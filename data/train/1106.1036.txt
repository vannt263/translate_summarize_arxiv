    "the interest devoted to quarkonium production has not decreased for the last thirty years .",
    "it is motivated by the search of the transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined state of matter , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the high density of gluons in the qgp is expected to hinder the formation of quarkonium systems , by a process analogous to debye screening of the electromagnetic field in a plasma @xcite .    nevertheless , the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider data on @xmath0+au collisions @xcite have also revealed that cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects play an essential role at these energies .",
    "all this confirms that , in fact , the interpretation of the results obtained in nucleus - nucleus collisions relies on a good understanding and a proper subtraction of the cnm effects , known to impact the quarkonium production in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions where the deconfinement can not be reached .",
    "we will focus on @xmath0+au data , where no qgp formation is possible and only cnm effects are in play .",
    "two cnm effects have been identified as important for quarkonium production : the nuclear absorption , commonly characterized as a final - state effect on the produced quarkonium state and parametrised through an effective breakup cross section , and the shadowing , _",
    "i.e. _ the modification of the parton densities in nuclei relative to the nucleon , an initial - state effect .",
    "moreover , we have recently realized that the theoretical uncertainty on the shadowing is not limited to the uncertainty on the modification of the parton distributions : we do not know the specific production kinematics at a partonic level , this prevents us to know the exact momentum fractions of the gluon in the nucleus and thus at which @xmath1 to evaluate it .    in this work",
    ", we illustrate the importance of cold matter effects on @xmath2 production in @xmath3pb and pbpb collisions at the lhc and we recall that a proper subtraction of cnm effects on quarkonium production is mandatory before any qgp studies at the lhc .",
    "as we have shown in earlier studies  @xcite , considering the adequate  partonic production mechanism  either via a or a process  affects the way to compute the nuclear shadowing and thus its expected impact on the  production . in the following , we will refer to the first scenario as the _ intrinsic _ scheme , and to the second as the _ extrinsic _ scheme .",
    "most studies on the  production in hadronic collisions are carried out in the intrinsic scheme .",
    "they rely on the assumption that the  pair is produced by the fusion of two gluons carrying some intrinsic transverse momentum  .",
    "the partonic process being a scattering , the sum of the gluon intrinsic  is transferred to the  pair , thus to the  since the soft hadronisation process does not alter significantly the kinematics .",
    "thus , in such approaches , the transverse momentum  of the  _ entirely _ comes from the intrinsic  of the initial gluons .",
    "however , the average value of  is not expected to go much beyond @xmath4 .",
    "so this process is not sufficient to describe the  spectrum of quarkonia in hadron collisions  @xcite .    for @xmath5",
    ", most of the transverse momentum of the quarkonia should have an extrinsic origin , _ i.e. _  the s  would be balanced by the emission of a recoiling particle in the final state .",
    "the  would then be produced by gluon fusion in a partonic process with the emission of a hard final - state gluon .",
    "this emission , which is anyhow mandatory to conserve @xmath6-parity , has a definite influence on the kinematics of the  production . indeed , for a given  momentum ( thus for fixed rapidity  @xmath7 and ) , the processes discussed above , _",
    "i.e. _  the intrinsic @xmath8 and the extrinsic @xmath9 , will proceed on the average from initial gluons with different bjorken-@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , they will be affected by different shadowing corrections .    in the intrinsic scheme",
    ", the measurement of the  momentum in  collisions completely fixes the longitudinal momentum fraction of the initial partons : @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the  mass .",
    "however , in the extrinsic scheme , the knowledge of the @xmath7 and  spectra is not sufficient to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "actually , the presence of a final - state gluon introduces further degrees of freedom in the kinematics , allowing several @xmath16 for a given set @xmath17 .",
    "the four - momentum conservation explicitely results in a more complex expression of @xmath15 as a function of  @xmath18 : @xmath19 equivalently , a similar expression can be written for @xmath14 as a function of  @xmath20 . even if the kinematics determines the physical phase space ,",
    "models are anyhow _ mandatory _ to compute the proper weighting of each kinematically allowed @xmath16 .",
    "this weight is simply the differential cross section at the partonic level times the gluon pdfs , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath21 . in the present implementation of our code",
    ", we are able to use the partonic differential cross section computed from _ any _ theoretical approach . in this work",
    ", we shall use the colour - singlet model ( csm ) at lo at lhc energy , which was shown to be compatible  @xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot - dsigvsdy - y_0 - 231010 ] for illustration with the magnitude of the -integrated cross - section as given by the phenix  data  @xcite , the cdf @xmath22 data  @xcite and the recent lhc  data at @xmath23 .",
    "br from @xmath24 fusion in @xmath25 collisions for @xmath26 from 200 gev up to 14 tev compared to the phenix @xcite , cdf @xcite and alice data.,width=264 ]    to obtain the yield of @xmath2 and @xmath27 in  and   collisions , a shadowing - correction factor has to be applied to the  yield obtained from the simple superposition of the equivalent number of  collisions .",
    "this shadowing factor can be expressed in terms of the ratios @xmath28 of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) in a nucleon belonging to a nucleus  @xmath29 to the pdf in the free nucleon :    @xmath30    the numerical parameterisation of @xmath31 is given for all parton flavours . here , we restrict our study to gluons since , at high energy , the quarkonia are essentially produced through gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "several shadowing parametrisations are available  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to eks98  @xcite , which is very close to the mean in the current evaluation of the uncertainty  @xcite on the gluon npdf and exhibit a moderate antishadowing .    the second cnm effect that we take into account concerns the nuclear absorption .",
    "in the framework of the probabilistic glauber model , this effect is usually parametrised by introducing an effective absorption cross section  .",
    "it reflects the break - up of correlated  pairs due to inelastic scattering with the remaining nucleons from the incident cold nucleus .",
    "the value of  is unkown at the lhc . at high energy ,",
    "the heavy state in the projectile should undergo a coherent scattering off the nucleons of the target nucleus  @xcite , in contrast to the incoherent , longitudinally ordered scattering that takes place at low energies .",
    "as argued in  @xcite , this should lead to a decrease of  with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "compilation and systematic study of many experimental data indicate that  appears either constant  @xcite or decreasing  @xcite with energy .",
    "hence , we can consider our estimates  @xcite of  at rhic energy as upper bounds for the value of  at the lhc .",
    "we choose three values of the absorption cross section that should span this interval ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in the following , we present our results for the  nuclear modification factor due to cnm effects in the extrinsic sheme in  and pbpb collisions at @xmath34 : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the observed  yield in @xmath37 ( ) collisions and @xmath38 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions occurring in one  or pbpb collision . without nuclear effects , @xmath39 should equal unity .     in  and pbpb collisions at @xmath40 , using eks98  @xcite gluon shadowing parametrisation and three values of @xmath41 ( from top to bottom :",

    "the curve with no absorption allows us to highlight the strong rapidity dependence of the shadowing .",
    "we can also notice that the shadowing alone should already be responsible for a quite large amount of  suppression , up to at @xmath46 .",
    "this is expected because one accesses at lhc energy the region of very small x in the gluon npdf ( down to @xmath47 ) . at backward rapidity",
    ", we are in the antishadowing region , with the antishadowing peak at @xmath48 . fig .",
    "[ fig : rppb_vs_y_and_rpbpb_vs_y_vs_cent ] shows that the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath49 for the centrality bins used by the atlas collaboration @xcite is similar for all the bins , with a dip at mid-@xmath7 .",
    "this shape is the opposite of the one obtained at rhic energy  @xcite , with a peak at mid-@xmath7 .",
    "one can also notice that @xmath49 decreases at very large rapidity showing that one has gone beyond the antishadowing peak . here , @xmath49 is systematically smaller at mid-@xmath7 than at forward-@xmath7 .",
    "this is also illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : rpbpb_vs_npart ] , with the centrality dependence of @xmath49 for two regions in  @xmath7 .",
    "this behaviour of the cnm effects may partially  or completely  compensate the opposite effect expected from  recombination , with a maximum enhancement at @xmath50 .",
    "we should however note that the recombination of @xmath51 pairs is expected to be less important if an experimental @xmath52 cut has to be imposed because of a limited acceptance at low @xmath52 .",
    "overall , one may observe a @xmath49 rather independent of @xmath7 resulting of two @xmath7-dependent effects .",
    "recently , we have also paid attention to the preliminary data on  production at rhic . in fig .  [",
    "fig : rdau_vs_yups ] , we show @xmath53 vs @xmath7 according to the extrinsic scheme .",
    "the results are displayed for 3 values of @xmath54 and for three shadowing parametrisations and these are compared to the available rhic data  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we know from lattice qcd that strongly interacting matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new state , the qgp . the objective of high energy nuclear collisions is to produce and study the qgp under controlled conditions in the laboratory .",
    "the study of quarkonium production and suppression is among the most interesting investigations in this field since calculations indicate that the qcd binding potential is screened in the qgp phase .",
    "as demonstrated in this work , other phenomena will also impact on the quarkonium production rates in nuclear collisions at the lhc .",
    "for instance , nuclear parton distributions modifications and cnm absorption of quarkonium must be accounted for before any qgp studies at the lhc become meaningful . e.g.f .",
