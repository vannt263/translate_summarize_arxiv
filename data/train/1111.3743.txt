    "<S> this guarantees that the quantum predictions for compatible tests are given by a single probability measure on a single probability space . </S>",
    "<S> compatibility implies that the probability @xmath5 of obtaining the result @xmath6 for the test @xmath1 is independent of other compatible tests @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 for all sets @xmath9 of compatible tests , and where @xmath10 is the joint probability of obtaining the results @xmath11 for the compatible tests @xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> assumption is formally equivalent to the no - signaling principle , but involves compatible tests instead of spacelike separated tests .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of the noncontextuality of results states that the result @xmath6 of test @xmath1 is the same regardless of other compatible tests being performed ; it only depends on @xmath1 and some hidden variables @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the correlation among the results of compatible tests can be expressed as @xmath13 for some common distribution @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> noncontextuality inequalities are expressions of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are real numbers and @xmath17 denotes that the maximum value of @xmath18 for any noncontextual correlations [ therefore satisfying ] is @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum contextuality is experimentally observed through the violation of noncontextuality inequalities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum nonlocality @xcite is a particular form of quantum contextuality which occurs when the tests are not only compatible but also spacelike separated . in this case , noncontextuality inequalities are called bell inequalities @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> examples are communication complexity @xcite , parity - oblivious multiplexing @xcite , zero - error classical communication @xcite , and quantum cryptography secure against specific attacks @xcite .    the goal of this work is to identify and perform an experiment with sequential quantum compatible tests , which produces correlations with the largest contextuality allowed under the assumption , which is assumed to be valid also for postquantum theories . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we first introduce a measure of contextuality of the correlations , the noncontextual content @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 corresponds to the maximum contextuality . </S>",

    "<S> next , we show how graph theory allows us to identify experiments in which the upper bound to @xmath20 predicted by qm is zero , and apply this method to single out an experiment for which @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> we define the _ noncontextual content _ @xmath20 of the correlations as the maximum value of @xmath27 over all possible decompositions as , i.e. , @xmath28 this definition is parallel to the definition of local content introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for correlations generated through spacelike separated tests , the noncontextual content equals the local content .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 will denote , respectively , the maximum value of @xmath18 for noncontextual correlations [ i.e. , which can be expressed as ] , quantum correlations , and correlations satisfying . </S>",
    "<S> now consider correlations satisfying and saturating @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> then , given a decomposition of such correlations as , with @xmath31 , @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath32=w_\\mathrm{nc } \\sum t_{a_1,\\ldots , a_n , x_1,\\ldots , x_n } p_\\mathrm{nc}(a_1,\\ldots , a_n|x_1,\\ldots , x_n)+(1-w_\\mathrm{nc } ) \\sum t_{a_1,\\ldots , a_n , x_1,\\ldots , x_n } p_\\mathrm{c}(a_1,\\ldots , a_n|x_1,\\ldots , x_n)$ ] . </S>",

    "<S> however , even if @xmath40 , inherent imperfections of actual experiments will prevent the observation of @xmath21 . in general , the more complex the experiment to produce the required quantum correlations is , the higher the probability that experimental imperfections lead to a higher upper bound for the noncontextual content . </S>",

    "<S> we calculated these three numbers for all nonisomorphic graphs with less than 11 vertices , and found that there are no graphs with less than 10 vertices with @xmath39 , and there are only four 10-vertex graphs with these properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum quantum violation of noncontextuality inequalities associated with three of them requires quantum systems of dimension higher than four , while dimension four is enough for the graph in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] , it can be easily seen that the following noncontextuality inequality is in one - to - one correspondence with the graph : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the probability of obtaining result @xmath44 when test @xmath49 is performed and result @xmath42 when test @xmath45 is performed . in this case , the coefficients @xmath16 in are all @xmath44 . </S>",
