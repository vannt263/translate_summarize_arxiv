    "compact symmetric objects are distinguished from other classes of compact radio sources by their striking degree of symmetry .",
    "this is due to the fact that csos tend to lie close to the plane of the sky , and so relativistic beaming plays a very minor role in their observed properties .",
    "they usually have well - defined lobes and edge - brightened hotspots on either side of an active core , often exhibiting an `` s '' shaped symmetry @xcite .",
    "csos are @xmath2 kpc in size , and usually have high intrinsic radio luminosities and low levels of polarization .",
    "their small physical size is thought to be attributable to the youth of the sources , rather than to confinement by a dense medium @xcite .",
    "it is likely that these sources will evolve into compact steep spectrum sources , and then into the large classical doubles @xcite .",
    "the advance speeds of the hotspots have been measured for a few csos , using data taken over @xmath010 years @xcite , and yield kinematic ages of 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath1 years .",
    "one of the most important properties of csos for studies of galaxy evolution is the very high rate of detection of  absorption lines @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "this  appears to be part of a circumnuclear structure which is thought to be feeding and obscuring the central engine @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have undertaken a survey to identify new csos from the vlba calibrator survey ( vcs ) .            [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the sources in this study were selected from images of positive declination sources in the vcs .",
    "negative dec .",
    "sources will be added at a later date .",
    "the cso candidates were identified based on at least one of the following criteria : a ) double structure at 2 ghz , 8 ghz or both , where `` double structure '' is considered to mean having two distinct components with an intensity ratio @xmath4 ; b ) a strong central component with possible extended structure on both sides at one or both frequencies ; c ) possible edge - brightening of one or more components .",
    "positive classification of csos requires multifrequency observations in order to identify the expected steep spectrum hotspots and a flat or inverted spectrum core .",
    "the @xmath040 selected sources were observed with the vlba at 2 frequencies in addition to the discovery frequency .",
    "details of these follow - up observations are reported in .",
    "images of the most promising cso candidates are shown in figure [ peckb_fig1 ] .",
    "the frequency of the image shown is indicated in the upper right corner of each plot , and the beam is displayed in the lower left .",
    "table [ peck_tab1 ] lists the flux densities of each component at all frequencies at which follow - up observations were made .",
    "columns 6 and 7 list the spectral indices of the components . the spectral index distribution for sources in which such an image was feasible are shown in figure [ peckb_fig2 ] .",
    "vlba imaging of  absorption in csos provides an unparalleled means of determining the kinematics of neutral gas within 100 pc of an active nucleus @xcite .",
    "vlba imaging of free - free absorption in csos is also possible , and allows us to probe the region of ionized gas surrounding the central engine @xcite .",
    "a complete sample of such sources will yield unique information about accretion processes and the fueling mechanism by which these young radio galaxies might evolve into much larger frii type sources .",
