    "quasi normal modes ( qnm s ) have been studied for quite a long time due to the possibility of gathering information from astrophysical objects in terms of their response to external perturbations , in the same sense as we may study a bell from its sound . for reviews and earlier notes",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are particularly useful to grasp also general properties of the metric under consideration - see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "stellar qnm s have been under considerable scrutiny over the last decades , since they provide not only a test for einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) , but also a look into the stellar structure and , indirectly , into the very nature of stellar matter and its properties , such as its equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "stars have an internal structure which must be accounted for when studying any kind of perturbation , be it a test scalar field or a gravitational perturbation . among these ,",
    "the axial perturbations are much easier to compute , since they do not mix with the fluid modes of the star @xcite .",
    "such axial perturbations ( along with the scalar and electromagnetic ) can be described by a wave equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the amplitude and @xmath2 , for the perturbative potential . for details , see the appendix .",
    "the polar perturbations mix with the fluid modes and require a completely different approach in their numerical analysis and evolution , and are not dealt with here .",
    "uniform stars , that is , stars possessing a uniform density @xmath3 are idealized astrophysical objects , since they can not exist in nature .",
    "unrealistic as they may sound , though , such stars provide an interesting background in which some insight on the field dynamics in stellar geometries may be gained , since the physical quantities of relevance ( mass , pressure and gravitational potentials of the metric ) are very straightforward to evaluate .",
    "we begin with such stars , but we do not limit ourselves to them .",
    "we present some results for the neutron and quark stars and compare these results to those of the well - known schwarzschild black holes .    for the neutron stars , we have dealt with the simplest model available , that of oppenheimer and volkov @xcite , consisting of a pure fermi gas of neutrons . for the quark stars ,",
    "we have also used one of the simplest models available , the mit bag model .    in this paper",
    "we consider qnms of uniform , neutron and quark stars and compare with the analogous results for black holes , in an attempt to describe properties inherent of astrophysical objects .    in section",
    "ii we present some results about uniform stars . within that section , the question of secondary modes in such stars is discussed . in section iii , we discuss neutron star qnms and in section iv we do the same for quark stars .",
    "comparative charts for all qnms are available in section v and the remarks and conclusions are left for section vi .    concerning units , we have used the geometric system of units , for which @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the masses have dimension of length and are measured in metres .",
    "the conversion factor from metres to kilograms is @xmath5 . before proceeding",
    ", we just recall a definition which will be very useful throughout this paper , that of _ compactness _ of a star . the compactness @xmath6 for a spherically symmetric star",
    "is defined in the literature as @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the star s gravitational radius and @xmath9 is its actual radius .",
    "we begin with a series of figures - from the data we have tabulated - on the frequencies of the qnms for uniform stars , with some of the masses we have chosen for neutron and quark stars , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( the first two were also used for neutron and quark stars ) , for the sake of comparison .",
    "one must bear in mind that such values are not special in any way , being just the results of star integrations for some particular choices of the central density @xmath14 , and even these latter choices are just choices - for more details on the matter , see section iii . in",
    "what follows , @xmath6 stands for the compactness of the star , @xmath15 for the multipole index and @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the real and the imaginary part of the frequency , respectively .    from the data we have compiled",
    ", we can make a few initial remarks .",
    "first , we have noticed that @xmath18 , as in the pure schwarzschild case .",
    "such a scaling property for @xmath19 in uniform stars was also explored in this work , and more data are left for subsection b. second , increases of @xmath16 with @xmath15 ( as expected ) .",
    "moreover , all axial frequencies have smaller real parts than their scalar counterparts , given some @xmath15 ( exactly like schwarzschild ) . but @xmath20 is higher for axial perturbations than for scalar ones ( in contrast to the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "we shall illustrate our data with a set of graphics .",
    "we begin with the picture for the scalar @xmath21 case , which can be viewed in fig .",
    "( [ l0b ] ) .    in fig .",
    "( [ l0b ] ) , the tail obeys a power - law , namely @xmath22 . a comparison between uniform star and schwarzschild bh modes for the @xmath21 scalar field is provided in fig .",
    "( [ compbhuni ] ) .",
    "notice that the bh - background scalar field oscillates much less than in uniform stars , although the tail decays much in the same way , according to the same power law .",
    "we have detected , throughout our investigation of compact uniform stars , the presence of secondary modes which decay faster than the dominant ones .",
    "since we have seen a similar behavior in the schwarzschild bh context ( see note at the end of this subsection ) and we have checked these schwarzschild bh data and concluded that they correspond to the first overtones , we can speak of overtones of the fundamental modes in the stellar context , also .",
    "these overtones show themselves in the form of wiggles in the envelopes of the misner curves characterising the qnms , as if there were modes ( actually , the overtones ) competing with the dominant ones .",
    "this issue of competing modes deserves special attention , especially for - but not limiting to - high compactnesses ( @xmath23 ) , when these wiggles become clearer .",
    "three examples of competing modes are provided in figs .",
    "( [ competing1 ] ) , ( [ competing2 ] ) and ( [ competing3 ] ) .",
    "a comment is due on the method of extraction of such secondary modes : we have fitted a damped oscillating function to the original data , so that we could know the frequency @xmath19 of the dominant mode ( the one with the weaker damping ) - visible at the end of the time evolution in all figures - and subtracted the fitted function from the original data . the remaining mode is the competing mode we have just talked about . for some extra details on the method , see @xcite .",
    "our fittings are not always very precise , so that we give no more than 3 significant figures for them , in the dominant mode .",
    "the remaining mode is not always very easy to fit , primarily due to these precision limitations .",
    "this remaining mode may look as if it were trembling , but in some cases we can still made a ( quite poor ) fitting to it .",
    "we expect it to have a stronger - usually much stronger - decay , which was indeed the case .    in the few cases in which we have seen a somewhat clear secondary mode , we could notice also a slightly faster oscillation . for the modes seen on fig .",
    "( [ competing1 ] ) we have , for instance , @xmath24 for the dominant mode and @xmath25 for the secondary mode , whereas for those seen on fig .",
    "( [ competing2 ] ) we have @xmath26 for the dominant mode and @xmath27 for the competing mode , so that the latter has a much stronger decay .",
    "the number of significant figures for the latter was also reduced , since it was obtained after a three - figure fitting had been performed .",
    "more data are available in table ( [ tablecompeting ] ) , for @xmath28 .",
    "these data simply confirm what we have said about the secondary modes in question : they oscillate somewhat faster ( in contrast to their schwarzschild counterparts ) and decay much faster than the dominant ones ( similarly to the schwarzschild bh case ) .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed in table ( [ tablecompeting2 ] ) , where the relation between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath19 for the dominant and the secondary modes is shown ( for the scalar @xmath29 field and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the oscillations are about 30% faster for the secondary modes and this percentage seems to have a weak - if any - correlation to the compactness @xmath6 , but the damping rates can be at least 4 times higher for the secondary modes , and sometimes up to 9 times , increasing sharply with @xmath6 . for the schwarzschild bh , at least for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 axial cases , the decay rate was around 3 times faster for the competing mode ( the first overtone ) . as for the first overtones",
    ", we could see that @xmath32 , but for @xmath17 the data seemed to fluctuate somewhat .",
    "this may be due to the fitting precision limitations to which we have referred earlier .",
    "see table ( [ tablecompeting ] ) .",
    ".comparing dominant ( @xmath33 ) and competing ( @xmath34 ) mode frequencies for several masses of uniform stars with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we did not place @xmath37 in tables ( [ cc1 ] ) , ( [ cc1b ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) because the neutron and quark stars do not share the simple @xmath18 property with the schwarzschild bhs , as seen in their respective sections .",
    "from the aforementioned tables we learn that the neutron stars modes are more strongly damped than its quark counterparts and these are , in turn , more damped than schwarzschild modes .",
    "the schwarzschild modes oscillate faster than the neutron star modes , but slightly less than the quark star modes .",
    "first of all , the oscillating frequencies of the qnms ( @xmath16 ) increases with increasing @xmath15 , for a given mass and perturbation , as in the black - hole case , irrespective of the star type .",
    "the damping @xmath20 of the modes , however , decreases with increasing @xmath15 , and does so very markedly , for all the masses and fields under study for uniform stars , whereas in the schwarzschild black - hole ( schbh ) case @xmath20 has a very slight increase instead for the axial field , while also decreasing ( very slightly , though ) for the scalar field .",
    "this is an interesting contrast .",
    "and uniform stars showed stronger dampings for axial fields than for scalar fields , also contrary to schbh .",
    "the neutron stars ( ns ) and quark stars ( qs ) modes , in general , showed an increase in @xmath20 with increased @xmath15 for scalar perturbations .",
    "for the axial modes , a similar trend could be detected for ns , and the only possible anomaly could be the @xmath10 case , when the @xmath38 mode had practically the same damping ratio as the @xmath39 mode , as can be seen at the end of the table ( [ cc2 ] ) .",
    "there is also a clear dependence of the modes on the uniform star mass mass , for a given compactness and perturbation , as in the schwarzschild case : the more massive a uniform star is , the slower is the oscillation of the field and the weaker is its damping .",
    "the same holds for the overtones we have found for them . as for the compactness",
    "@xmath6 itself , given a fixed mass , an increase in @xmath6 made both @xmath40 and @xmath41 decrease , that is , more compact stars had slower and ( much ) less damped oscillations .",
    "the case of competing modes ( overtones ) in stars needed our foremost attention , since it seems not to have been mentioned anywhere so far .",
    "we could detect such competing modes in very compact uniform stars , especially when @xmath42 onwards . and here comes another contrast : while in the schwarzschild black hole context the overtones have oscillated more slowly than the fundamental mode ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , for the uniform stars the opposite was true .",
    "a similar feature was detected for some qs modes in which the presence of overtones was detectable , although we could not find clear overtones for ns .",
    "in general , leaving aside the uniform stars ( unis ) due to their dependency on @xmath6 , given some perturbation type , @xmath43 and @xmath15 , qs modes tend to oscillate a bit faster than schbh modes for higher masses and slightly slower for smaller masses , and these , in turn , oscillate faster than ns modes .",
    "when it comes to damping , though , the sch bh modes are the least damped of all , followed by the qs modes ( at least twice as damped ) and by ns modes ( the most damped of all ) .",
    "that is , ns modes are the slowest in oscillation rate and the most damped .",
    "at least , in the mass range under scrutiny .    nevertheless , if unis are considered , their modes have slightly higher @xmath16 than schbhs , but their @xmath20 can be much smaller than their sch bh counterparts , so that these uniform stellar modes are , in fact , the least damped of all modes , particularly when @xmath6 increases towards its limiting value of @xmath44 .",
    "the sch bh and the uniform stars have a simple scaling property for @xmath19 , namely @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a constant depending on the perturbation , on @xmath15 and , for the uniform stars , @xmath6 . not so for the ns and qs modes , where we have not found so simple a correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath19 . for qs",
    "at least , a decreasing @xmath43 meant an increasing @xmath19 ( especially for @xmath16 ) . for ns",
    ", a curious feature emerged : the larger @xmath43 is , the higher @xmath19 is , especially @xmath16 , in sharp contrast to what has been seen for schbh , unis and qs . at any rate , however , in the mass range we have worked with , even the most massive ns have presented modes which were slower and more damped than the most massive schbh , unis and qs modes .",
    "we are still in the search for the reason(s ) for such a behaviour .",
    "uniform stars are stars possessing a uniform density @xmath14 , and references abound in the literature , as in @xcite . for these stars ,",
    "computations are very easy , as we shall see .",
    "the star mass function is simply @xmath47 if @xmath48 and @xmath49 if @xmath50 .",
    "hence , in terms of the radius @xmath9 and the mass @xmath43 of the star , one has @xmath51 .",
    "the pressure is determined via the oppenheimer - volkov equation , @xmath52 and is given by @xmath53 which approaches zero smoothly as @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 term of the metric is given by @xmath56 which reduces to the schwarzschild @xmath55 for @xmath50 .",
    "one point is of utmost importance in what follows : the expression for @xmath57 becomes singular when @xmath58 .",
    "since the star pressure can not be infinite anywhere , one concludes that there is an upper limit to the degree of compactness ( @xmath59 ) for any star .",
    "in fact , since @xmath60 can not exceed @xmath61 , no star can have @xmath62 , so there s a gap in @xmath6 between schwarzschild black holes and spherically symmetric stars of any kind .",
    "this limitation stems from general relativity itself , not from any particular stellar model .    from the existing literature",
    "@xcite,@xcite we have the wave equation satisfied by the scalar and gravitational perturbations , namely @xmath63 where @xmath1 stands for the perturbation amplitude and @xmath2 , the perturbative potential .",
    "the latter is written as @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ v&=&(1-\\frac{2m}{r})[\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{r^2}+\\frac{2\\sigma m}{r^3}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 depending on whether we are dealing with scalar , electromagnetic or axial perturbations .",
    "the first of these equations holds inside the star , and the latter holds outside .",
    "we can now illustrate some of the potentials , and find out how they change with the compactness .",
    "such an illustration is available in fig .",
    "( [ vstar ] ) .",
    "we have employed a direct numerical method consisting of a grid in the tortise coordinate @xmath66 and the time coordinate @xmath67 . since @xmath66 runs from some finite @xmath68 at @xmath69 to @xmath70 when @xmath71 , we start by specifying the field @xmath1 ( scalar or axial ) and its time derivative at @xmath72 in the region of interest in @xmath66 ( usually a gaussian wave packet centered around some @xmath73 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the field is given by @xmath74 in which @xmath75 is the spacing in @xmath66 and @xmath76 is the time step . given the ratio @xmath77 ( the so - called mesh ratio ) , one must have @xmath78 for the sake of convergence .",
    "we stop at some @xmath79 and analyse the data for all @xmath66 at that time .",
    "reflection may occur at the borders of the grid ."
