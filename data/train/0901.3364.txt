    "primitive meteoritic materials contain compelling evidence for the short - lived radionucides ( slrs ) 10 , 26 , 36 , 41 , 53 , 60 , 107 , and 182 in the early solar system @xcite .",
    "these radionuclides have a half - life @xmath4  myr and are potential high - resolution chronometers of events during the epoch of planet formation @xcite , but only if they were introduced at discrete times and were uniformaly distributed in the solar system .",
    "the potential sources of these radionuclides inform us about the young sun s stellar neighborhood @xcite , or its magnetic interaction with an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the decay of one short - lived radionuclide , 26 , might have been the principle heat source in planetesimals and responsible for the differentiation of the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites in the first 1 - 2 myr of the solar system @xcite .",
    "the origin of slrs is controversial .",
    "the half - life of each is much shorter than the @xmath2100  myr mixing time of the interstellar medium @xcite and the excess abundances of at least five radionuclides ( 10 , 36 , 26 , 41 , and 60 ) require one or more `` local '' sources in addition to the average galactic background @xcite .",
    "two principle scenarios emerged soon after the first reports of fossil slrs in meteorites : ( _ i _ ) an origin in one or more neighboring massive stars , either type ii supernova ( sn ) progenitors @xcite or wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite ; and ( _ ii _ ) production by irradiation of gas or dust with energetic particles from the active young sun @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario invoking an origin in a nearby intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch star @xcite is generally discounted because of the very low probability of such an encounter @xcite .",
    "each of the two schools of thought has developed elaborate models @xcite but neither has produced a comprehensive explanation of the origin , abundance , and distribution of all the slrs @xcite .",
    "the origins of three slrs seem unambiguous : ( _ i _ ) @xmath5be ( @xmath6  myr ) inferred from excess @xmath5b @xcite could have been produced by energetic particle irradiation but not by stellar nucleosynthesis . although magnetic trapping of galactic cosmic rays in the protosolar molecular cloud has been advanced as an alternative explanation @xcite , it is inconsistent with variations in the inferred initial 10/9 ratio @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) excess 36 correlated with the ratio @xmath7cl/@xmath8s and attributable to the decay of 36 ( @xmath9  myr ) was reported in sodalite , an alteration phase that replaced anorthite in cais and chondrules from cv chondrites @xcite .",
    "the inferred 36/@xmath7cl ratio at the time of sodalite formation is @xmath10 .",
    "if the sodalite formed late ( @xmath111.5  myr after cai crystallization , based on absence of 26 ) , the initial 36/@xmath7cl ratio was @xmath12 .",
    "this is inconsistent with a massive stellar source and requires a late episode of irradiation .",
    "( _ iii _ ) @xmath13ni excess correlated with the @xmath14fe/@xmath15ni ratio is evidence for live 60 , a radionuclide that can not be produced by irradiation and must have originated in one or more massive stars @xcite .",
    "high - precision nickel isotope measurements in several groups of magmatic iron meteorites indicate that 60 was uniformly distributed in the solar nebula @xcite but its initial abundance , ( 60/56)@xmath16 , is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the lower end of the range of estimates is consistent with the expected abundance in star - forming regions if star formation rates were approximately twice as high at the epoch of solar system formation @xcite and/or the half - life of 60 is actually longer than the published value ( @xmath17  myr ) .",
    "ironically , the origin of 26 ( @xmath18  myr ) , the first slr to be discovered @xcite and the one best studied , remains an enigma .",
    "a significant contribution by irradiation is disputed on the grounds that ( _ i _ ) production models adjusted to achieve the required 26/27 ratio over - predict the observed initial abundance of @xmath19ca ( @xmath20  myr ) whose co - occurrence indicates a common origin @xcite , ( _ ii _ ) the flux of energetic particle inferred from x - ray observations of young solar - type stars would have been insufficient to produce the 26 @xcite , and ( _ iii _ ) a lack of correlation between the presence of 26 and 10 , which _ was _ formed by irradiation @xcite .",
    "finally , the canonical value [ @xmath21 of the initial 26/27 ratio in the majority of cais from primitive chondrites @xcite , the consistent chronology of cai and chondrule formation between @xmath22pb-@xmath23pb and 26-@xmath24 mg systematics @xcite , and the apparently uniform mg - isotope compositions of bulk chondrites , mars , moon and the earth @xcite are evidence for a uniform distribution thought inconsistent with a central ( solar ) irradiation source .",
    "although these observations favor an origin of 26 in massive stars , the mechanism and timing of its delivery to the early solar system remains unclear .",
    "two models have been proposed : instability - induced mixing of gaseous sn ejecta during the molecular cloud core phase @xcite , and injection of slr - bearing dust grains into the later protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "the relatively small cross - section of the solar nebula dictated that the progenitor was within @xmath21  pc of the solar system @xcite .",
    "such a circumstance is possible only in the dense environment of a large stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "incorporation of hot , low - density gas from sn ejecta into the denser , cooler disk gas is inefficient @xcite . instead",
    ", ouellette et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed that several slrs , including 26 , were delivered to the early solar system as grains that condensed from sn ejecta and vaporized upon entering the relatively high - density gas in the disk @xcite .",
    "disks around low - mass cluster stars persist for up to 6  myr @xcite , longer than the main sequence lifetime of the most massive sn progenitors @xcite .    however , any explanation for solar system 26 invoking a late introduction of sn ejecta has four significant shortcomings : ( _ i _ ) not all stars form in large clusters and most clusters are dynamically unbound and disperse in @xmath210  myr @xcite .",
    "it is statistically unlikely that the sun would have been suffiently close to a massive star at the end of the latter s main sequence life @xcite .",
    "ii _ ) even the most massive stars have a main sequence lifetime of at least 3  myr and , if they and the sun formed simultaneously , the former would have ended in supernovae late in the evolution of the solar nebula and probably long after cais containing the canonical 26/27 ratio had formed .",
    "these cais , the oldest dated solids from the solar system @xcite , have a narrow range of inferred initial 26/27 ratios suggesting that they formed in @xmath251  myr @xcite , consistent with the duration of class 0-i stages of protostars @xcite .",
    "a short interval of cai formation is also consistent with the narrow range of their oxygen isotope compositions ( @xmath26 ) @xcite , which are similar to the inferred oxygen isotopic composition of the sun @xcite .",
    "[ later cai formation would presumably have reflected the rapid oxygen isotopic evolution of the solar nebula along the slope - one carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous minerals ( ccam ) line towards the terrestrial value ( @xmath27 ) , a trend attributed to co photochemical self - shielding and radial mixing in the disk @xcite . ]",
    "( _ iii _ ) late injection of 26 into the protoplanetary disk would likely have disturbed the oxygen isotopic composition of the disk from the ccam line , and this is not observed @xcite .",
    "( _ iv _ ) sn models that produce the canonical 26/27 ratio invariably over - predict the abundance of 53 and must impose fallback of the innermost layers , e.g. , meyer ( 2005 ) .",
    "( these models also over - predict the abundance of 60 , see  [ sec.others ] ) .",
    "a scenario in which slrs from coeval sn progenitors were injected into the protoplanetary disk can be evaluated for its statistical plausibility .",
    "gounelle & meibom ( 2007 ) estimated that the probability that any given disk is contaminated by a sn with enough 26 to reach the canonical 26/27 ratio is @xmath28% .",
    "however , there are three limitations to their model : ( _ i _ ) it underestimated the probability by assuming a maximum disk radius of 50  au based on observations and theoretical arguments that disks within 0.1  pc of massive ( o ) stars suffer from photoevaporation @xcite . but disks further from o stars are invariably larger @xcite and this effect compensates the greater distance from the source of radionuclides .",
    "their model overestimated the probability by neglecting the expansion of the host star cluster and using the @xmath291  myr - old orion nebular cluster as a template , rather than a cluster at the minimum age ( 3  myr ) when supernovae occur . in older clusters ,",
    "stars are more widely separated .",
    "( _ iii _ ) it only included the contribution of sn to 26 .",
    "26 is also produced and ejected from stars with initial masses @xmath30  in their luminous blue variable ( lbv ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) phases @xcite .",
    "the uniform distribution of 26 , the existence of the canonical 26/27 ratio in cais , the adherence of primitive oxygen isotope compositions to the ccam line , and the low likelihood of a sn injection event all point to the introduction of 26 before the collapse of the protosolar cloud .",
    "indeed , the oxygen isotopic composition of the _ entire _ solar system appears to be displaced from the locus of mean galactic evolution @xcite , suggesting primordial contamination .",
    "the source of 26 must also have introduced 41 , which co - occurs with an inferred initial abundance of 41/40 @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the half - life of this radionuclide is only 0.1  myr , limiting any time delay between production at the source and its incorporation into cais .",
    "the source of 26 can not have been accompanied by substantial 53 , as is the case of sn ejecta without fallback onto the remnant @xcite .",
    "( the predicted 53 abundance in the interstellar medium is consistent with its inferred initial abundance in the solar system and a `` local '' source is not required . ) any relationship between the source of 26 and that of 60 remains to be determined .",
    "there is as yet no evidence that 60 and 26 are correlated and had the same origin .",
    "indeed , there may be a _ deficit _ of 60 relative to 26 compared to sn ejecta that can not be explained by free decay of the two radionuclides : the initial ratio of 60 to 26 in the solar system was 0.1 - 0.2 @xcite , lower than the 0.3 deduced from the galactic average @xmath32-ray emission @xcite and theoretical predictions @xcite .    very massive ( @xmath30  )",
    "stars eject 26 ( and other slrs ) during the wolf - rayet phase of mass loss near the end of hydrogen core burning , as well as in sn @xcite .",
    "wr winds might account for a large fraction of the total fluence and galactic distribution of @xmath32-rays from the decay of 26 @xcite .",
    "[ the non - detection of @xmath32-ray emission in the decay line of 26 from the nearest wr star @xmath33-velorum can be explained by the dispersal of most of the radionuclide to large angular separation @xcite ] .",
    "we propose that most or all of the 26 in the early solar system originated in wr winds from one or more massive stars that contaminated the molecular cloud from which the sun formed .",
    "( sahijpal & soni ( 2006 ) also considered the contribution of wr winds to solar system inventories of slrs . )",
    "these stars could have been members of the same embedded cluster as the sun , or , more likely , members of another cluster that formed in the same giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) ( figure [ fig.cartoon ] ) .",
    "an analogous `` self - contamination '' scenario has been invoked to explain anomalous abundance patterns in some globular clusters @xcite .",
    "our proposal is based upon the following : ( _ i _ ) the amount of 26 ejected in the winds of a single 60  star @xcite is sufficient to contaminate @xmath34  of solar - metallicity gas to the canonical 26/27 ratio of the solar system .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the wr phase can occur as soon as 1 - 2  myr after star formation and more than 1  myr before the sn @xcite , making it more likely to contaminate residual star - forming molecular gas .",
    "( _ iii _ ) wr winds have speeds of up to 2000  km  sec@xmath35 @xcite and can traverse star - forming regions ( 10 - 100  pc ) in @xmath36  yr .",
    "( _ iv _ ) in contrast to single clusters where star - formation may be co - eval , star formation in a molecular cloud can occur over an interval of at least a few myr @xcite , and possibly longer @xcite as clumps of gas with a mass spectrum @xmath37 @xcite form multiple embedded stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "for example , the orion star - forming complex contains several subgroups that are several myr older than the orion nebula cluster @xcite(_v _ ) wolf - rayet winds contain multiple slrs , including 26 , 41 , and 36 , but little or no 53 or 60 @xcite .",
    "we propose that the collapse of the protosolar cloud homogenized the distribution of these isotopes ( but see  [ sec.funcais ] ) .",
    "our scenario does not preclude a sn - triggered collapse @xcite , which would have occured _ after _ the wr phase .    in  [ sec.disk ]",
    "we revisit the scenario of 26-introduction by sn into the protoplanetary disk with a monte carlo approach that used more realistic disk sizes , accounted for the expansion of clusters , and included the contribution from both wr winds and sn . while our results differ quantitatively from those of gounelle & meibom ( 2007 ) , the calculated probability of a disk having the canonical solar system 26/27 ratio is nevertheless small ( @xmath382% ) .",
    "we also consider bondi - hoyle accretion of contaminated intracluster gas , as proposed by throop & bally ( 2008 ) and find its inclusion does not significantly alter this result (  [ sec.bondihoyle ] ) .",
    "we then use a similar monte carlo model to investigate a scenario where 26 is introduced by wr winds into the parent molecular cloud of the sun (  [ sec.cloud ] ) .",
    "this model readily reproduces the canonical 26/27 ratio of the solar system .",
    "we discuss the delivery of 26 from wr winds into the molecular cloud , interpret cais that lack the canonical 26/27 ratio , and , in the context of the cloud contamination scenario , present additional calculations for three other slrs ( 41 , 60 , and 36 ) in  [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "we calculated the galactic distribution of 26/27 ratio in the disk injection scenario @xcite by extending the model of williams & gaidos ( 2007 ) to include 26 from both winds and sn , a dynamically realistic description of cluster expansion , and the effect of the uv field of massive stars on disk size . unlike williams & gaidos ( 2007 ) we do not explicitly consider disk evolution and disappearance in our model because this occurs on a timescale of @xmath26  myr @xcite , much longer than the likely epoch of cai formation .    for simplicity , we assume that every young low - mass star has a disk and that the properties of the disk are independent of stellar mass .",
    "according to lada & lada ( 2003 ) , 72% of stars form in clusters with @xmath39 members distributed in size according to @xmath40 . the remaining 28% form in isolation or in clusters with fewer than @xmath41 stars .",
    "the most massive members of such small clusters will be @xmath25  b stars that do not produce winds or type ii core - collapse sn .",
    "disks around members of such clusters will not receive any exogenous 26 .",
    "the other 72% of disks were represented by @xmath42 monte carlo calculations .",
    "the size of the host cluster of each disk was drawn from a @xmath43 distribution ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the number of massive stars ( sn progenitors with @xmath45 ) in the host cluster was selected from a poisson distribution with an average of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the masses of these stars were drawn from a power - law initial mass function @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "clusters form over @xmath21  myr @xcite and most star formation in a single cluster occurs within @xmath23  myr @xcite .",
    "we assumed the instantaneous formation of all massive stars and an exponentially decaying rate of low - mass star formation after massive star formation .",
    "we used age statistics for members of the orion nebula cluster @xcite to infer a decay time of 2.7  myr , which we adopted for clusters of all sizes .",
    "we assumed that the rate of star formation does not depend on stellar mass .    the 26/27 ratio in the disk around the @xmath48-th low - mass star at an interval @xmath49 after the star s formation at time @xmath50 was calculated by summing over the product of the the yield @xmath51 of the radionuclide from the @xmath52-th wind or sn , the solid angle subtended by the disk at the time of ejection @xmath53 , and the factor of free decay between that time and @xmath54 ; @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the ( constant ) radius and mass of the disk , @xmath58 is the mass fraction of 27 , and @xmath59 is the distance of the disk from the source star during the at the time of ejection .",
    "we considered injection as instantaneous because the speeds of sn ejecta and winds are @xmath60  km  s@xmath35 , and the 26-producing wr phase of an individual massive star is brief ( @xmath21  myr ) compared to the dispersal timescale of the cluster ( @xmath210  myr ) . to account for the changing perspective of each star as it orbits inside the cluster , we used the isotropic average of the projected cross - section of each disk , @xmath61 . @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath53 were estimated by spline interpolation in a grid of yield calculations by limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) .",
    "we used a default disk radius of 200  au @xcite but to account for photoevaporation by the uv radiation from massive stars @xcite we reduced this to 30  au for disks within 0.2  pc of the cluster center at 3  myr , and to zero for disks within 0.1  pc .",
    "this was a conservative assumption , since the evidence for significant disk truncation is weak @xcite , but it only has a minor effect on our results .",
    "like ouellette et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we adopted a minimum mass solar nebula disk mass of 0.013  and the fractional abundance of 27 given by lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "as in williams & gaidos ( 2007 ) , we placed the massive stars at the cluster center @xcite and assumed that , at any time , low - mass stars were distributed with an inverse - square density profile , such that an equal number of stars reside in shells of constant thickness out to the edge of the cluster at @xmath62 . to model cluster expansion , and",
    "thereby determine the distance of a disk to each source of 26 , we developed an empirical relationship for the time dependence of @xmath62 based on a series of numerical simulations of clusters containing between 100 and 15,000 stars .",
    "the dynamical simulations were preformed using the nbody4 code running on the cambridge university grape-6a card @xcite . in each case",
    "the stars were initially ( 3  myr ) distributed in a plummer sphere @xcite with a radius set by the requirement that the initial surface density @xmath63  pc@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the virial parameter @xmath65 ( ratio of kinetic to gravitational potential energy ) was set to 1.5 .",
    "this condition is brought about by a cluster local star formation efficiency of 33% in the embedded cluster and the instantaneous removal of the remaining gas at 3  myr @xcite .",
    "the size of the cluster was explicitly determined at regular intervals until an age of 10  myr .",
    "we found that the expansion of the cluster from its size at 3  myr was closely approximated by @xmath66^{1/2}(t-3~{\\rm myr}),\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the gravitational constant and @xmath68 is the average stellar mass . the expression multiplying 0.45",
    "is the cluster s virial speed @xcite . in each of our simulations",
    "the surface density of the cluster fell to the background level of field stars ( 2 - 3  pc@xmath64 ) by 10  myr , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "[ eqn.exp ] specifies the radius of the cluster at the epoch @xmath53 of a massive stellar wind or sn .",
    "the uniform distribution of low - mass stars with distance from the cluster center @xmath69 was then used in eqn .",
    "[ eqn.al26 ] to produce a distribution of 26/27 .",
    "these distributions were summed over all events in a cluster , corrected for free decay , averaged over @xmath42 realizations , and multipled by 0.78 to produce a galactic distribution .",
    "the calculated distributions of 26/27 are plotted in figure [ fig.disk ] and the fractions of systems that have any initial 26 or 26 abundances exceeding the canonical value are given in table [ tab.stats ] .",
    "we also report the 95-percentile values of 26/27 .",
    "we considered two values for @xmath49 , which in the solar system represents the epoch of cai formation .",
    "the probability is 1.1% for @xmath70  myr , rising to 1.9% by 1  myr .",
    "the probability is higher at still later , but unlikely cai formation times ( not shown ) .",
    "our probablities are several times higher than that reported by gounelle & meibom ( 2008 ) , mostly due to the larger disk size we used , but are still small .",
    "our estimates are nonetheless optimistic because we assume all high - mass stars form prior to low - mass stars .",
    "if all stars form instantaneously , then nearly 3  myr must elapse before 26 is produced , and _ no _ disks contain 26 by the time of cai formation .",
    "disks might also accrete gas from their natal cluster before it is removed by winds and sn explosions .",
    "throop & bally ( 2008 ) proposed that bondi - hoyle accretion of residual , sn - contaminated cluster gas onto the protosolar nebula produced isotopic anomalies in the solar system , including the presence of slrs .",
    "they estimated that disks around solar - mass stars in a 3000-star cluster could accrete an additional @xmath20.01  of gas , an amount comparable to the original mass of a disk , over the 2 - 4  myr that gas remained in the cluster .",
    "we estimated the amount of 26 that could be introduced by this process by specifying the fraction of disk mass @xmath71 acquired by bondi - hoyle accretion by the time of cai formation , and assuming that accretion is constant as long as intracluster gas is present .",
    "we assumed that the maximum amount of mass that can be accreted by a disk is equal to the initial disk mass @xcite , i.e. @xmath72 . to account for the absence of cluster gas during the history of later - forming stars we adjusted the accreted mass by the ratio of the time interval between low - mass star formation and the disappearance of cluster gas , and the lifetime of the cluster gas .",
    "like throop & bally ( 2008 ) , we assumed a gas lifetime of 3  myr .",
    "we calculated the average 26/27 ratio of cluster gas during the period of bondi - hoyle accretion ( see  [ sec.cloud ] for details ) and then determined the final 26/27 of the disk as 26/27 = ( 1-f)(26/27)@xmath73 + f(26/27)@xmath74 where the subscripts refer to the initial value and the average value during accretion .",
    "we calculated distributions of the 26/27 ratio for combined bondi - hoyle accretion and disk injection and found that the former has a negligible effect ( figure [ fig.disk ] and table [ tab.stats ] ) .",
    "this is because low - mass stars that form late enough ( @xmath23  myr ) to acquire significant 26 will accrete little gas because the intracluster gas disappears soon thereafter .",
    "this is of course entirely a result of our ( reasonable ) assumption that intracluster gas is evacuated by the time the massive stars leave the main sequence , if not earlier .",
    "nevertheless the same cosmochemical timing arguments that apply to the disk injection scenario also apply to the bondi - hoyle scenario ; cais probably formed by the time a disk had formed , or very soon thereafter , and thus later accretion of contaminated gas can not be responsible for the presence of 26 in them .",
    "in this scenario the sun s natal giant molecular cloud spawned an earlier generation of massive stars [ figure [ fig.cartoon](a ) ] whose wr winds contaminated the rest of the cloud ( b ) , from which the sun subsequently formed , perhaps in a second cluster ( c and d ) .",
    "we calculated the distribution of 26/27 ratios in this scenario by @xmath42 monte carlo simulations , each corresponding to a disk formed from a gmc contaminated by an immediately previous generation of massive cluster stars .",
    "the number and masses of those stars were drawn from the distributions described in  [ sec.disk ] .",
    "the mass of gas in the gmc was calculated using an average stellar mass derived from the initial mass function of kroupa ( 2002 ) , and a total star - formation efficiency of 10% @xcite .",
    "the amount of 26 added to the molecular cloud by massive stellar winds was calculated as a function of time using the yields and times of limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) and by assuming 100% delivery efficiency and instantaneous mixing into the cloud ( we discuss this assumption further in  [ sec.efficiency ] ) .",
    "we did not include sn ejecta in these calculations , but include it when we consider 60 in  [ sec.others ] ( but see the footnote on sn ejecta delivery in  [ sec.efficiency ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the sun and cais formed simultaneously .",
    "we first carried out a series of calculations for different intervals of elapsed time ( 3 - 6  myr ) between the formation of the earlier generation of massive stars and the sun ( dashed lines in figure [ fig.cloud ] ) .",
    "if the interval is less than 3  myr contamination has yet to take place in our model and newly - formed stellar systems lack 26 .",
    "an interval of 4 - 5  myr is most likely to produce the cai value .",
    "the history of low - mass star formation in molecular cloud complexes is poorly known but clearly non - monotonic @xcite .",
    "we calculated more realistic distributions by again adopting the exponential rate with a 2.7  myr decay time based on the data of palla & stahler ( 1999 ) .",
    "this is plotted as the heavy solid line in figure [ fig.cloud ] .",
    "that curve can be understood as a convolution of the star formation history with the 26/27 distributions for `` starburst '' scenarios .",
    "the probability of 26/27 exceeding the canonical value is 6.2% .",
    "this figure depends on the assumed star formation history : for example , varying the decay time constant by @xmath751  myr changes the fraction between 4.3 and 6.5% .",
    "however , the peaks in all three distributions are near the cai value ( solid lines in figure [ fig.cloud ] ) .",
    "this robustness is a result of negligible 26 production at times earlier than 3  myr and negligible low - mass star formation at times much later than 5  myr .",
    "we found that simulations which produce a 26/27 ratio within 2@xmath76 [ @xmath77 @xcite ] of the canonical value were most likely to involve contamination of a gmc having @xmath78  of gas by the massive members of a cluster with @xmath79 stars .",
    "such a situtation is exemplified in our galaxy by ngc 3603 , which contains multiple wolf - rayet stars within an hii region @xcite .",
    "our scenario requires a plausible mechanism for the efficient introduction of the 26 carrier in wolf - rayet winds into the surrounding molecular cloud . in the calculations above",
    ", we assumed a 100% delivery efficiency but this will clearly not be the case .",
    "in general , mixing between the hot , tenuous gas from massive stars and cooler , denser molecular gas is thought to be very inefficient @xcite .",
    "sn - enriched gas from hii regions is thought to find its way back into the interstellar medium ( if at all ) through a circuitous route taking @xmath2100  myr @xcite .",
    "impact of sn ejecta onto a protostellar cloud core may induce mixing via rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite but the injection efficiency is too low to explain the solar system s canonical 26/27 ratio @xcite , the protosolar cloud core initially contained @xmath80  of 26 .",
    "the mass fraction of 26 in the convective hydrogen shell of a 25  star at the end of its main - sequence life is @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "therefore _ at least _",
    "@xmath82  of sn ejecta must have been introduced ( assuming no free decay ) .",
    "boss et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report that only @xmath83  is injected in their model . ] .",
    "gas in wolf - rayet winds will be less dense than sn ejecta by several orders of magnitude and efficient mixing in the gas phase is even less likely .",
    "instead , the high - velocity ( 500 - 2000  km  sec@xmath35 ) winds will develop a reverse shock upon encountering the much denser molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we propose that refractory dust grains are the principle carrier of 26 and 41 in wolf - rayet winds and that these can dynamically decouple from the shocked wind and imbed themselves into the surrounding molecular cloud , analogous to the `` aerogel '' model described by ouellette et al .",

    "both explanations can be reconciled with the presence of nucleosynthetic anomalies in some of these cais @xcite if the 26 carrier contributed a distinct component to the solar system s stable isotope composition @xcite .",

    "it hypothesises that ( a ) the precursors of these cais was isotopically heterogeneous and , contrary to typical refractory inclusions , escaped a cycle of complete evaporation - condensation , ( b ) the carrier of 26 was relatively volatile , and ( c ) it was lost to varying degrees by sublimation of these cai precursors prior to their melting .",

    "we considered a 60  progenitor for which 41 and 26 yields from the wolf - rayet winds were separately published @xcite .",
    "we accounted for the additional free decay of 26 , which is ejected during the hydrogen - burning wn wolf - rayet phase , while 41 is produced in the later core he - burning wco phase @xmath99  yr later .",
    "the corrected ratio of 41 to 26 in the ejecta is @xmath100 times higher than in the solar system , but would be consistent if an additional time @xmath101  myr elapsed before cai formation .",
    "it is interesting that this is approximately the same duration as the wolf - rayet phase itself before the final sn ib / c .    * 60 * : wolf - rayet winds contain negligible amounts of 60 @xcite .",
    "live 60 in the early solar system could have originated in sn from the same early generation of massive stars that produced the 26 , or in an even earlier generation of stars @xcite .",
    "we repeated the calculations described in  [ sec.cloud ] but included sn contributions and calculated 60/56 ratios in the same manner as 26/27 , using the yields of limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) and the solar iron abundance of lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath102  myr based on the 41 abundance . in figure [ fig.alfe ] we plot monte carlo realizations for different epochs ( 3 - 8  myr before the sun ) for the earlier generation of massive stars .",
    "if all sn ejecta is incorporated , the 60/56 is over - predicted by an order of magnitude relative to 26/27 .",
    "a comparision with the ratio of the two slrs ( black line ) inferred from @xmath32-ray measurements @xcite suggests that this discrepancy may be in part the result of an overprediction of 60 yield - or underprediction of 26 yield - by the nucleosynthesis models ( see  [ sec.summary ] ) .",
    "there are two other explanations suggested by figure [ fig.alfe ] : ( a ) the sun formed 3  myr after the massive stars , when many massive stars were in the wr phase but few sn had occurred ( a scenario represented by the red dots extending below the primary locus ) ; or ( b ) the sn contribution was attenuated by an effect such as described in  [ sec.efficiency ] .",
    "explanation ( a ) is statistically unlikely if star formation is uncorrelated and demands precise timing between the formation of massive stars and the sun ( @xmath23  myr later ) , but could be demanded in a scenario where the sun s formation was triggered by a sn @xcite .",
    "our simulations indicate that the initial solar 26/27 and 60/56 ratios can be reproduced in this manner only in star clusters with @xmath103 whose most massive members have @xmath104 .",
    "as such large clusters are relatively rare , this scenario is _ a priori _ less likely .",
    "explanation ( b ) requires a reduction in the sn contribution to 60 ( and 26 ) by a factor of 20 .",
    "this could be due to a combination of effects ; retention or fallback of the central region of the progenitor @xcite , inefficient delivery of sn ejecta into the cloud (  [ sec.efficiency ] ) or the collapse of the protosolar cloud and a decrease in its cross - section by the time the sn ejecta arrived .",
    "an alternative scenario ( c ) is that 60 in the solar system is the relict of an even earlier episodes of massive star - formation and contamination @xcite of which the 41 and most 26 has decayed .",
    "60 will decay to 5% of its initial abundance in 6.5  myr , during which 26 decays to 0.2% , and 41 essentially vanishes .",
    "this last explanation is viable only if this earliest generation of stars ceased to contribute slrs to the molecular cloud after @xmath26  myr .    *",
    "36 * : we estimated the abundance of 36 , which is also ejected by wr stars during the wco phase @xcite , and calculated the 36.35 ratio in the same manner as 41/40 .",
    "we find that our model underpredicts the ratio by at least three orders of magnitude .",
    "it has already been recognized that stellar nucleosynthetic models can not account for this isotope , especially if it was introduced at the epoch of cai formation 1 - 2  myr before the host sodalite alteration phases were formed . at the present time",
    ", the only viable explanation appears to be a late episode of irradiation by energetic particles @xcite",
    "the canonical abundance of 26 in the solar system can not be explained in terms of a late injection of debris from a nearby sn into the gaseous protoplanetary disk because ( _ i _ ) the dispersal of the natal cluster and the finite time window for injection make it _ a priori _ an unlikely event ( @xmath382% ) , ( _ ii _ ) 26 was already present in cais , which formed within @xmath105  yr of the initial collapse of the protosolar nebula and the formation of the protoplanetary disk , and ( _ iii _ ) the oxygen isotope systematics of primitive solar system materials show no sign of a late introduction of sn ejecta . the apparently uniform distribution of 26 in meteorites and samples of the earth , moon , and mars suggests homogenization during the collapse of the protosolar cloud .",
    "we showed that the canonical 26/27 ratio can be explained if the solar system formed from a molecular cloud contaminated by wolf - rayet winds from massive stars that formed 4 - 5  myr earlier .",
    "a sn contribution is not required to explain the abundance of 26 , although it is not necessarily excluded .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that such a level of contamination occured depends on the poorly - understood star formation histories in gmcs ; we estimate that it is @xmath26% .",
    "however , our model predicts that the canonical value is close to the _ most likely non - zero value _ in the galactic distribution .",
    "the initial 41/40 ratio can also be explained by wolf - rayet wind contamination if @xmath20.5  myr elapsed between its introduction by winds and the formation of cais . if this scenario is also to explain primordial 60 in the solar system , the cloud must have been contaminated with sn ejecta as well . if sn ejecta is included ,",
    "our model over - predicts the abundance of 60 by an order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy could be rectified by some combination of the following : ( a ) most 60 falls back onto sn remnants rather than be ejected @xcite ; ( b ) most dust grains in sn ejecta are retained and destroyed in the shocked ejecta and never enter the molecular cloud ; ( c ) the protosolar cloud was already collapsing and presented a smaller cross - section when the sn ejecta arrived ; and ( d ) the 60 is a relict of an even earlier episode of massive star formation and contamination for which all the other slrs have decayed away .",
    "absence of a significant excess of 53 seems to require ( a ) , but not to the exclusion of the other explanations .",
    "our model does _ not _ explain the inferred abundance of 36 , and another mechanism such as irradiation much be invoked .",
    "a key uncertainty in our model is the efficiency with which 26 is introduced into the host molecular cloud and the degree to which it becomes uniformly mixed .",
    "we propose that the carrier of 26 was dust grains and that these dynamically decoupled from the wind and embedded themselves ( intact ) into the cloud , but this hypothesis needs further investigation .",
    "furthermore , our model does not account for the inhomogeneities in sn ejecta and wr winds that could produce spatial variation in the contamination of a molecular cloud .",
    "there are also uncertainties in calculations of the evolution and nucleosynthesis of massive stars that could quantitatively alter our results .",
    "production of 26 by neon burning during the type ib / c sn that follows the wolf - rayet phase is sensitive to the progenitor mass @xcite and for a 60  progenitor , could be as large as the yield from the wind @xcite .",
    "new models that include stellar rotation predict higher yields of 26 , an earlier appearance of 26 in the wr wind ( as early as 1  myr ) , and a smaller minimum initial mass for entry into the wr phase @xcite .",
    "larger 26 yields would relieve the requirement for high delivery efficiency to the molecular cloud and may resolve the discrepancy between the predicted amount of concomitant 60 from sn ejecta and the inferred initial abundance of the radionuclide in the solar system .",
    "future tests of this model could compare predicted wr stellar contamination with short - lived isotopes ( e.g. , 107 ) whose abundances seem consistent with models of the interstellar medium ( g. huss , pers .",
