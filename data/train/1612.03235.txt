    "<S> crystallization is a process of great practical relevance in which rare but crucial fluctuations lead to the formation of a solid phase starting from the liquid . </S>",
    "<S> like in all first order first transitions there is an interplay between enthalpy and entropy . </S>",
    "<S> based on this idea , we introduce two collective variables , one enthalpic and the other entropic , to drive crystallization in molecular simulations . defined in this way , these collective variables do not prejudge the structure the system is going to crystallize into . </S>",
    "<S> we show the usefulness of this approach by studying the case of sodium that crystallizes in the bcc crystalline structure . using these two generic collective variables , we perform variationally enhanced sampling simulations and find that the system transforms spontaneously and reversibly between the liquid and the bcc phase .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : :    05.10.-a , 02.70.ns , 64.70.d-    crystallization is a remarkable physical process in which the disordered atoms of a liquid spontaneously form beautifully ordered periodic patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a phenomenon of great importance in many areas of application , from metallurgy to material science , pharmacology and even biology . </S>",
    "<S> not surprisingly this problem has received considerable attention . understanding the way in which crystallization proceeds also holds the key to improve many scientific and technological processes . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices to recall here the difficult art of protein crystallization . </S>",
    "<S> since experiments can only provide a limited insight into this phenomenon , already in the very early days of computer simulation much effort has been devoted to the study of crystal nucleation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately in most cases the time scale of nucleation is much longer than what can be reached in an atomistic simulation . </S>",
    "<S> early on this problem was tackled by forcing nucleation using unphysically deep temperature quenches so as to bring the nucleation time scale within the reach of simulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is not without problems since it can even change the nature of the nucleation process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason enhanced sampling methods have been extensively used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of them are based on the definition of appropriate collective variables ( cvs ) able to distinguish one type of local order from another . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples of cvs used in this context are the steinhardt order parameters @xcite or the ones introduced by santiso and trout @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the use of these kind of cvs can prejudge the structure the system is going to crystallize into . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it would be extremely useful to have an enhanced sampling method that does not assume from the start the final structure . in this way , besides illuminating important details of the nucleation , one could use it in a predictive way , complementing structure prediction methods that are based on finding the crystal structure of lowest energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would be extremely valuable in those cases in which the crystal structure is stabilized by strong entropic effects as in the case of superionic or plastic crystals .    in order to achieve this result the cv </S>",
    "<S> should not be related to this or that feature of the geometry of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> it thus comes natural to recall that in crystallization , like in all first order transformations , there is a trade off between enthalpy and entropy , and introduce two cvs able to describe these changes . </S>",
    "<S> of course enthalpy @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total energy , @xmath2 the pressure and @xmath3 the volume , is easy to estimate while for the entropy there is no exact expression . </S>",
    "<S> however in order to bias the system we do not need to reach this daunting task and even an approximate expression will do . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid state theory provides an expression in which the excess entropy per atom is expanded in an infinite series of terms involving multiparticle correlation functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first such term @xmath4 , used in ref .   to perform insightful analysis , includes only two body correlations and is given by : @xmath5 r^2 dr .      </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : pair_entropy}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath6 is the radial distribution function and @xmath7 is the density of the system . in a different context </S>",
    "<S> the use of @xmath4 has already been suggested to address rare events problems in which the entropy plays a dominant role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath8 and @xmath4 have a proper thermodynamic meaning only when averaged . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of this paper we use their instantaneous values to define useful cvs .    in this spirit </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two cvs , one enthalpic @xmath9 and the other entropic @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the potential energy and @xmath13 the number of atoms in the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus do not include the kinetic energy contribution to the total energy in the definition of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is slightly more complex . </S>",
    "<S> we first define a mollified version of the radial distribution function : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance between particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a broadening parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the mollification is necessary to ensure that the derivatives of @xmath19 relative to the atomic positions are continuous . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath19 is inserted into equation and the integral calculated numerically up to a cut off distance @xmath20 . in the spirit of the work of tiwary and berne @xcite @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> is chosen so as to optimize the frequency of transitions between solid and liquid .    before describing the details of our simulation we would like to pause a little to discuss a small but crucial technical issue . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been recognized that a given crystalline order can conflict with the periodic boundary conditions of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and that allowing the md cell shape to vary is essential to study processes that involve crystals . </S>",
    "<S> this is at the heart of the parrinello - rahman method that allows the md cell to change under conditions of constant stress @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the md cell shape is expressed by an upper diagonal matrix @xmath21 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> changes in @xmath22 are driven by the unbalance between the internal and the external stress . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward application of the parrinello - rahman method to the liquid state is however problematic since a liquid offers no resistance to shear and left to its own devices the md box shape fluctuates randomly assuming also inconvenient cigar like shapes . in order to remedy this we take </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 and this forces the volume to be always close to a cube but still allows the off diagonal elements to vary , and thus accomodate different structures .    </S>",
    "<S> we now exemplify the usefulness of this approach in the case of sodium crystallizes in the bcc structure . </S>",
    "<S> we simulated na using an embedded atom model @xcite whose melting temperature has been determined . </S>",
    "<S> biased md simulations were performed using lammps @xcite patched with a private development version of plumed 2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the equations of motion was carried out with a timestep of 2 fs . </S>",
    "<S> we employed the stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat @xcite with a relaxation time of 0.1 ps . </S>",
    "<S> the target pressure of the barostat was set to its standard atmosferic value and a relaxation time of 10 ps was used . </S>",
    "<S> systems composed of 250 atoms were employed . in order to determine the gibbs free energy surface @xmath24 as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 we used the variationally enhanced sampling ( ves ) @xcite method in its well tempered variant @xcite with a bias factor @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the bias potential was expanded in legendre polynomials up to order 40 in both dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the ves functional was optimized using the averaged stochastic gradient descent algorithm @xcite with step size 5 kj / mol . </S>",
    "<S> six walkers were used to explore @xmath24 @xcite all starting in the liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> the sampling time in the calculation of the gradient and the hessian was 500 md steps ( 1 ps ) for each optmization step . for the calculation of @xmath10 we used a cutoff of @xmath26 nm and a broadening parameter @xmath27 nm .     </S>",

    "<S> the solid structures were identified using common neighbor analysis ( cna ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bcc - like atoms are colored in blue and , as expected , the solid configurations in na have a bcc crystalline structure . </S>",
    "<S> a liquid configuration is also shown with liquid - like atoms colored in red . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] , employing these cvs we were able to describe accurately the phase transition between the liquid and crystalline phases in na without having had to feed any prior information on the system . </S>",
    "<S> two basins were observed , one of high enthalpy and high entropy , and another of low enthalpy and low entropy , corresponding to the liquid and solid basins , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the trade off between enthalpy and entropy in first order phase transitions discussed in the introduction . as hoped for </S>",
    "<S> , the system crystallized into the bcc structure . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is reversible ( see supplemental material ) allowing the free energy surface to be estimated .    from our calculation we can also get the difference in free energy between the two phases as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the set of cvs @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the integrals are restricted to the liquid ( l ) and solid ( s ) basins , respectively . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] we plot @xmath31 for na in the temperature range 300 - 400 k. from this calculations , we estimate the melting temperature to be around 350 k in agreement with results obtained using a different technique ( 366 k ) @xcite , if one takes into account that the melting temperature is a strong function of system size @xcite . for details of these calculations </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to the supplemental material .     </S>",
    "<S> difference in free energy between the liquid and solid phases of na as a function of temperature as calculated from eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the melting temperature reported in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> is marked in the abscissa axis with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the straight line has only been fitted to the three middle points . , </S>",
    "<S> scaledwidth=49.0% ]    once that @xmath31 is determined as a function of temperature , the difference in entropy between the liquid and the solid , @xmath33 , can be calculated from the thermodynamic identity @xmath34 . from this equation @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> is estimated to be @xmath35 j mol@xmath36 k@xmath36 per atom </S>",
    "<S> . since also @xmath37 can be calculated , the definition of gibbs free energy @xmath38 provides an independent estimate of @xmath33 . in this case @xmath33 at 350 k is @xmath39 j mol@xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> k@xmath36 per atom . these estimates are comfortably similar and in line with the experimental value @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> j mol@xmath36 k@xmath36 @xcite .    one way to asses the degree with which the cv set @xmath41 describes the transition mechanism is to calculate the committor . </S>",
    "<S> we define the committor @xmath42 as the probability of reaching the solid basin before the liquid one , if trajectories with random velocities drawn from a maxwellian distribution are started at a configuration characterized by @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results of @xmath43 along the minimum free energy path @xcite in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> details of the calculation can be found in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from this figure that the committor has a sharp transition from 0 to 1 and that the position of the isocommittor ( @xmath44 ) agrees well with the position of the maximum of the free energy .     </S>",
    "<S> free energy and committor @xmath43 along the minimum free energy path for na at 350 k. the grey vertical line shows the position of the isocommittor . </S>",
    "<S> the blue continuous line is the free energy ( left axis ) and the orange dotted line is the committor @xmath43 ( right axis ) . , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in conclusion , the use of a collective variable that couples directly to entropy has proven to be very promising . we have illustrated the power of the approach by crystallizing na in its minimum free energy structure </S>",
    "<S> the success of our calculation suggests a general strategy for tackling those problems in which entropy alone or in combination with enthalpy plays a role . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , one needs to find approximate ways of expressing the entropy and the enthalpy . once that the variables have been chosen , the use of metadynamics @xcite or ves can amplify the fluctuations of these variables and accelerate the observation of the desired transition . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that a rigorous definition of entropy is not necessary and metadynamics or ves are very accommodating in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we plan to apply this strategy to many other problems . </S>"
