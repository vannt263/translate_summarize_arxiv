    "the star . [ star ]",
    "it is easy to see that the star has only two maximal independent sets ( see figure [ star_fig ] ) : one in which the center alone plays @xmath1 , and another one in which the spokes do so .",
    "if we are looking for efficiency ( defined as fewer @xmath1s , which are supposed to be costly ) it is very easy to find that the first case is the best one .",
    "suppose that we are in the _ bad _ ne ( spokes exerting the costly effort ) , then a social planner could shift to the _ good _ equilibrium by incentivating a contribution from the center .",
    "when the center is contributing , then , by best response , all spokes stop doing so .",
    "this mechanism will be formalized in the next section , but the idea is that of incentivating a contribution from agents that were not contributing in a ne , thus the system will move to a new ne , which may reduce the social cost of being in equilibrium . @xmath9        the problem of finding all maximal independent sets of a general network is however not an easy one and will be discussed in section [ speed ] .",

    "behavioral _ and could be justified by several modelling choices with rational agents . up to now we have defined ( pure ) nash equilibria without explicitly defining actions and payoffs ; this however could easily be done .",
    "one possibility is the following .",
    "any agent attributes utility @xmath25 to a homogeneous good , if she has access to it ( independently of whether it is provided by herself or by any of her neighbors ) , and her utility is satiated by one unit of it . finally , the cost of providing the good is a positive value @xmath26 .",
    "since utilities are satiated , and in equilibrium every agent has local access to the good , then considering efficiency from the point of view of minimal aggregated costs is enough to achieve global efficiency . in our model agents consider only local spillovers and exclude any externality from any other non - neighbor player . in this sense",
    "the network structure formalizes the range of the externalities .",
    "note however that , because of satiation , the utility of agents is not linear in the contribution effort of neighbors , so that our model is not included in the class of games analyzed by ballester et al .",

    "good discrepancy between efficient strategy profiles and equilibria .",
    "a general class of games that includes the one from bramoull and kranton ( 2007 ) is analyzed in bramoull et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , however also their class does not include our non  satiated utilities .    in next section",
    "we will define formally the general _ best reply _",
    "mechanism that we consider , and that we implement also in the numerical simulations . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it may seem that we exclude full rationality when we assume that agents respond to changes with a best response rule that considers only the present configuration but is myopic and not strategic on possible future new changes .",
    "consider , however , that another explanation for agents not being interested in future expected payoffs is a high rate @xmath27 of temporal discount .",
    "the kind of situation we have in mind is that of every agent deciding whether or not to exert a fixed costly effort that is beneficial to herself and also to her neighbors , so that a typical situation of free riding incentives arises",
    ". this could be the case with farmers or firms adopting new technologies , with an information network and a cost for possible failures .",
    "another application could be that of several municipalities in a given region ; the public good could be a library or a fire brigade , and two municipalities are linked if the public good in one of them makes the same public good undesirable in the other one because of geographical proximity .",
    "finally , since the mechanism we propose requires low costs of shifting between strategies and repeated interaction , a good application could be that of a big firm encouraging people to share cars in order to minimize parking places .",
    "action @xmath1 would mean ` take the car ' and an employee would play @xmath0 if a friend gives her a lift .",
    "generally , in any of these applications there could be a planner whose objective could reasonably be that of minimizing costs .",
    "suppose that the planner considers all possible ne of the game ( all maximal independent sets of the network ) and wants to minimize among them the number of nodes exerting effort @xmath1 ( i.e. find a maximal independent set of minimal cardinality : mne ) .",
    "she could impose the proper action on the agents , and the resulting configuration , being a ne , would be stable without imposing more incentives .",
    "suppose , however , that the planner does not know such an optimal distribution ( remember that the theoretical problem is typically a complex one ) or that moreover she may not even know anything about the network .",
    "assuming that we also have a time dimension , our question is : would it still be possible for the planner to build a _ mechanism _ that would incentivate the agents to move towards an optimal mne ?",
    "our answer is only theoretical but positive : at the limit of infinite time such a mechanism exists , and it will lead to a mne with probability @xmath1 .",
    "what we assume is that the social planner s goal is to minimize the costs of a ne , when she has the possibility of incentivating players actions out of equilibrium , but she is not able to modify the structure of the network .",
    "it is clear that if the planner had the possibility of changing the network structure , directly or by incentives , at a reasonable cost ( as is the case considered on a different network game by haag ad lagunoff ( 2006 ) ) then the problem would look very different",
    ". it would be enough to approximate a star  like configuration such as the one analyzed in example [ star ] , and the solution would easily be found .    in the next section",
    "we show how we obtain our result .",
    "we show that our setup is included in the hypothesis of a theorem first proved in geman and geman ( 1984 ) and presented here in appendix [ geman ] .",
    "the proof of this equivalence is based on three lemmas , whose proofs are in appendix [ proofs ] . section [ speed ] analyzes , mainly by means of numerical simulations , how the simulated annealing approach that we propose performs in two very different network structures : regular random networks and scale free networks .",

    "this strategy will probably find only a local minimum , and this problem arises even when we run our mechanism .",
    "a fast version of the mechanism is not accurate in such networks because such local minima may have many more contributors than the mne of the network .",
    "the problem of finding a mne among all the ne is in general not a trivial one , and the difference between the aggregate number of nodes playing @xmath1 in ne could vary significantly even in homogeneous networks , as shown in example [ reg_rand_ex ] . the star structure ( example [ star ] ) is a trivial but dramatic example : there are two ne , one in which the center alone plays @xmath1 , and another in which all the spokes do so and the center free rides .",
    "the main practical problem in the implementation of the mechanism we propose is clearly the necessity of infinite time .",

    "the system will reach a local minimum , which can be easily identified even in finite time ( the higher the @xmath51 the faster the convergence ) . noting that the values @xmath92 are typically irrealistically low , and that the algorithm therefor converges very slowly , the choice of a proper heuristic @xmath75 could be appropriate . this choice would depend on a profit / costs comparison but also , in the case of finite time , on the structure of the network ( e.g. the star needs a single flip to move from the bad ne to the mne ) . as shown in section [ speed ] , a particular care should be applied because for some networks there is a concrete risk of finding a local minimum that is very inefficient    finally , even if the planner does initially not know the real structure of the network , she could infer it link by link as the steps of the mechanism are played . in this way she could mix the mechanism with a theoretical investigation , and could target nodes non  randomly in order to maximize the likelihood of finding the desired mne .",
    "the analysis of such a sophisticated approach would be much more complicated .",
    "what we give here is an upper bound that , we prove , holds exactly ( even if in the limit of infinite time ) .",
