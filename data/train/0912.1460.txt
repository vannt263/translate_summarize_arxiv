    "the amplitude of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) dipole anisotropy is about two orders of magnitudes greater than the anisotropies at higher multipoles that are primarily generated during cosmic epochs until the last scattering surface of redshift @xmath3 .",
    "it is widely believed that the dipole anisotropy is produced by the doppler effect due to the relative motion between the earth , i.e. an observer , and the frame where the cmb looks nearly isotropic ( hereafter we call it the cmb rest - frame ) .",
    "the measured cmb dipole amplitude tells that the relative velocity has an amplitude of @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 ( @xmath6 in the unit @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "the peculiar velocity consists of the five vector contributions @xcite : the motion of the earth around the solar system barycenter ( @xmath8  km  s@xmath5 ) , the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xcite , the ( hypothetical circular ) motion of the lsr around the milky way ( @xmath9220  km  s@xmath5 ( the iau 1985 recommended value ) , or @xmath9250  km  s@xmath5@xcite ) , the motion of the milky way in the local group , and the motion of the local group with respect to the cmb rest - frame .",
    "the origin of the fifth component , the peculiar velocity of the local group , is still uncertain and has been under discussion over the past two decades ( e.g. , @xcite and also see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this peculiar velocity is believed to be generated by the spatial inhomogeneities of mass ( mainly dark matter ) distribution in nearby large scale structures via gravitational instability as predicted in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated structure formation scenario .",
    "therefore the peculiar velocity field is expected to reflect properties of structure formation in the low - redshift universe .",
    "for example , the peculiar velocity of the local group with respect to the cmb rest - frame is estimated to be @xmath10  km  s@xmath5 , based on the result of @xcite .",
    "this is greater than the rms amplitude of the peculiar velocity , @xmath11  km  s@xmath5 , predicted from the linear theory of the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however , due to the difficulties in inferring the mass distribution from the observed galaxy distribution , i.e. the galaxy bias uncertainty , the origin of the peculiar velocity is not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "then a naive question may arise ; how special is the cmb rest - frame ? one may think that cosmic large - scale structures have formed via gravitational instability over 13.7 g years in the cmb rest - frame .",
    "in other words , the universe may still stay in the cmb rest - frame over the cosmic age .",
    "however , a possibility has been discussed that the cmb rest - frame may not coincide with the rest frame of galaxy distribution due to super - horizon scale physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the present - day universe is in the mysterious phase , the cosmic accelerating phase .",
    "the origin of the cosmic acceleration is one of the most profound problems in modern cosmology and physics , and it is sometimes discussed that the cosmic acceleration is perhaps related to the horizon - scale physics .",
    "for example , while dark energy is one possible explanation of the cosmic acceleration , dark energy should have spatial perturbations inevitably on horizon scales , if it is not a cosmological constant ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . or the primordial power spectrum , produced in the inflationary era , may have weird behaviors on horizon scales such as the truncated power spectrum as speculated from the low cmb quadrupole amplitudes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus exploring the rest frame of the present - day universe",
    "may give a clue to the horizon - scale physics ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , this may give an independent test on the cosmological principle , the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe .",
    "the rest frame of the present - day universe may be defined by the frame where the galaxy distribution looks isotropic on a sufficiently large scale ( hereafter we will call it the matter rest - frame or the rest - frame of the local universe ) . the relative motion of the earth to the matter rest - frame causes a dipole anisotropy modulation in the observed galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "the dipole anisotropy is caused by the two effects .",
    "first , photons from galaxies ahead of / behind the earth are blue-/red - shifted by the doppler effect , causing their fluxes to be brightened / dimmed and therefore the galaxies to be included / excluded in the magnitude limited sample .",
    "secondly , special relativity predicts the aberration of angles causing the surface number density of galaxies to be enhanced / suppressed in the direction ahead of / behind us , even if the intrinsic galaxy distribution is perfectly homogeneous on the sky .",
    "if the motion has a similar amplitude inferred from the cmb dipole , the induced dipole modulation is small at a sub - percent level .",
    "hence a large - area survey of distant galaxies or radio sources is suited for exploring this dipole anisotropy , because the intrinsic galaxy clustering that has greater amplitudes at low redshifts may cause a significant contamination .",
    "there have been many attempts made to explore this dipole anisotropy from such surveys @xcite . in particular blake and wall @xcite analyzed the radio source distribution based on the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) data @xcite , and then claimed a possible detection of the dipole anisotropy that are consistent with the cmb dipole in the amplitude and direction within 2@xmath12 and 1@xmath12 levels , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the cosmological dipole signature from the galaxy catalogs constructed from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 6 ( dr6 ) data @xcite .",
    "the use of the photometric sdss galaxy sample has several advantages : the sky coverage is large ( about 20% of the full sky ) , the photometry is well - calibrated and the photometric redshift information of each galaxy is available . in doing this ,",
    "we develop a method to explore the dipole modulation in a pixelized galaxy distribution properly taking into account the covariances due to the poisson shot noise and the intrinsic clustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage .",
    "in particular the photometric redshift information of sdss galaxies is useful to reduce the clustering contamination from nearby structures .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss how a planned large - area galaxy survey such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) can be useful to explore the dipole anisotropy .    here",
    "it may be worth mentioning advantages and shortcomings of our method compared to the peculiar velocity field studies @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns with the dipole pattern in the galaxy distribution due to the observer s motion with respect to the matter rest - frame . comparing this and cmb dipole anisotropies can address if the inferred matter rest - frame agrees with the cmb rest - frame within the measurement errors .",
    "this paper does not discuss the origin of our motion ( or the motion of the local group ) nor which structures in the local group cause our motion with respect to the cmb rest - frame , the so - called convergence depth .",

    "even if there exists the _ matter rest - frame _ where the intrinsic galaxy distribution looks perfectly isotropic , the peculiar motion of the earth relative to the matter rest - frame induces an apparent angular modulation in the galaxy number density field on the sky @xcite .",
    "there are two effects that cause this modulation .",
    "the first is the aberration effect , causing the observed number density field to be increased or decreased in the angular direction forward or backward of the earth s motion , respectively .",
    "the second is the doppler effect : depending on the shape of spectral energy density of a galaxy , the doppler effect causes the apparent magnitude of galaxy to be brighter or fainter , leading the galaxy to be included into or excluded from the magnitude limited sample .",
    "the net effect arises from the linear sum of these two effects in a case that the peculiar velocity is much smaller than the speed of light .    in the following , we will in more detail model the effect of the earth s peculiar motion on the angular number counts of galaxies defined for a given limiting magnitude . in so doing , we assume for clarity that the galaxy distribution is perfectly isotropic on the sky in the matter rest - frame , and in other words we ignore intrinsic anisotropies in the galaxy distribution arising from large - scale structure formation .",
    "we shall come back to the intrinsic anisotropy contamination later .",
    "special relativity predicts that , due to aberration of angle , the relative velocity of an observer to the matter rest - frame causes the angular position of a galaxy observed on the sky to be displaced : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the angle between the direction of the galaxy seen by the observer and the direction of the observer",

    "we will similarly ignore the contribution of @xmath20 for simplicity .",

    "the angle @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the angular direction of the earth s peculiar velocity @xmath16 on the celestial sphere and is fully specified by two parameters .",
    "next let us consider the doppler effect on the galaxy counting .",
    "besides redshift due to the cosmic expansion , the peculiar velocity of an observer relative to the comoving rest frame of galaxy distribution causes a photon emitted from a galaxy to be redshifted or blueshifted depending on the angular direction of the galaxy relative to the peculiar velocity direction .",
    "the observed frequency @xmath28 is related to the rest frame frequency @xmath29 via @xmath30 where the angle @xmath17 is defined in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tant ] ) .",
    "if we assume that an intrinsic flux density of a galaxy [ in the units of erg  s@xmath31  @xmath32  hz@xmath5 ] is simply given by a power law as @xmath34 , the conservation of photon number tells that the observed flux density @xmath35 is expressed as @xmath36 the apparent magnitude of the galaxy in a given filter is obtained by integrating the flux density over a range of transmission frequencies of the filter , and therefore the observed magnitude , @xmath37 , is related to the rest frame magnitude , @xmath38 , via @xmath39 if we assume that the intrinsic number counts of galaxies , where galaxies brighter than a given limiting magnitude @xmath40 are included in the sample , is simply given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 being a numerical coefficient of order unity @xcite , the observed number counts are found from eqs .",

    "as shown in table  [ tbl : sdss_chi2result ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : deltachi2_map ] , the `` faint '' samples , which are supposed to be more contaminated by an imperfect star - galaxy separation than for the `` bright '' samples , tend to prefer the dipole directions at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "this is counter - intuitive , because the faint samples may suffer from more star contamination towards lower galactic latitudes , which in turn causes the dipole direction in the lower latitudes due to the enhanced overdensity .",
    "hence the imperfect star - galaxy separation seems not a main source of the systematic effects . on the other hand , if comparing the `` deep '' and `` shallow '' samples , the shallower sample is supposed to be more affected by the intrinsic galaxy clustering contamination from more evolving nonlinear structures at lower redshifts , if the photometric redshifts are well reliable .",

    "[ fig : prob_beta ] shows that the dipole amplitudes tend slightly larger for shallower samples .",
    "another concern arises from the partial sky coverage .",

    "[ fig : sdss_expected_dipole_pattern_s.eps ] . a data having a wider sky coverage , such as lsst , is desired to settle down this issue .",
    "the reason for all but bd samples , when excluding the sgh data , show the minimum @xmath67 values around the northern galactic pole may be attributed to imperfect galactic dust extinction correction , although it is not perfectly clear how galactic dust can produce the difference in the bs and bd samples ( or , in other words , how effects of galactic dust differ among different redshifts ) . in this paper",
    "we have assumed that the dust extinction correction by the sfd dust map is perfect , but it is well - known in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that there may remain some residual systematics in the map . in summary , since the bd sample with and without the data in the sgh , which is the most robust sample against possible systematics among our four samples , indicates zero dipole , we conclude that the aberration effect is not detected from the sdss dr6 in our analysis .    , but here for these plots , we have used the sdss dr6 data in the northern galactic hemisphere only . ,",
    "as we have so far shown , a survey with large sky coverage and sufficiently deep redshift coverage is required to detect the aberration effect .",

    "we first considered the pixelized map with 213 pixels ; each pixel has an area of @xmath155 square degrees or @xmath156 degrees scale .",
    "the pixel size is sufficiently large , so we use the linear theory to compute the sample variance contributions .",

    "it is clear that the lsst may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect : the accuracy of the @xmath135 parameter estimation is at a level of @xmath160 , while the dipole directions can be determined with the precision of @xmath161 degrees in radius . if we can have a full - sky survey with similar depth to the lsst , the ultimate precision is 10 degrees in radius .",
    "in this paper we have used the sdss dr6 galaxy catalog to explore the dipole anisotropy pattern in the angular galaxy distribution caused by the aberration effect due to the earth s peculiar motion to the matter rest - frame .",
    "the sdss dr6 catalog , which covers about 8000 square degrees , allows us to construct the currently most reliable galaxy catalog for our purpose because the data has well - calibrated , homogeneous and secure photometric and astrometric properties .    after developing a method to explore the aberration effect signal ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] ) , we estimated the detectability of the dipole signal for sdss- and lsst - type surveys assuming the cmb dipole amplitude and the concordance @xmath0cdm model properly taking into account the contamination effects ( sec .  [ sec : rough_estimate ] ) .",
    "we found that the intrinsic galaxy clustering at low redshifts gives a significant contamination . recalling that for a cdm model the galaxy distribution has greater inhomogeneities at smaller scales ,",
    "the small - scale galaxy distribution at lower redshifts is viewed by an observer with larger angles , and the strong inhomogeneities significantly obscure the aberration effect if the earth s peculiar motion to the matter rest - frame is similar to that for the cmb dipole amplitude , i.e. @xmath162 . in other words , the dipole anisotropy due to the intrinsic clustering can be greater than the aberration effect for a low - redshift galaxy catalog . the poisson contamination due to the discrete galaxy distribution is smaller , but not negligible even with such a huge number of sdss galaxies .",
    "therefore our results imply that the previous report on a possible detection of the aberration effect may be due to these contaminating effects ( see also @xcite ) .    to remove the contaminating effect of the low - redshift galaxies as much as possible",
    ", we used the photometric redshift information to define a secure catalog of galaxies .",
    "we considered the four galaxy catalogs to study possible remaining systematic effects due to the star - galaxy separation and the intrinsic clustering contamination , as are defined in table [ tab : samp ] .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl : sdss_chi2result ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : deltachi2_map ] , the `` faint '' samples , which are supposed to be more contaminated by an imperfect star - galaxy separation than for the `` bright '' samples , tend to prefer the dipole directions at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "this is counter - intuitive , because the faint samples may suffer from more star contamination towards lower galactic latitudes , which in turn causes the dipole direction in the lower latitudes due to the enhanced overdensity .",
    "hence the imperfect star - galaxy separation seems not a main source of the systematic effects .",
    "we also compared the `` deep '' and `` shallow '' samples by using the photometric redshift information .",
    "as described above , the shallower sample is supposed to be more affected by the intrinsic galaxy clustering contamination from more evolving nonlinear structures at lower redshifts .",
    "however , the dipole directions for both the deep and shallow samples are found to be similar , which indeed prefers a direction around the cmb dipole direction within the @xmath163-@xmath12 region , except for the `` faint - deep '' sample ( see fig .  [ fig : deltachi2_map ] ) .    among the four galaxy catalogs , the `` faint - deep '' and `` faint - shallow '' samples are found to give a possible detection of dipole amplitude given as @xmath164 corresponding to the peculiar velocity @xmath165 km  s@xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_beta ] ) .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the cmb dipole amplitude by a factor 10 .",
    "the peculiar velocity amplitude of @xmath166 km  s@xmath5 is similar to the virial velocities of a massive cluster , however , we know our galaxy is not in such a cluster . on the other hand , the large - scale ( relative ) bulk flow of @xmath167 km  s@xmath5 is at @xmath168 deviations from the typical peculiar velocity of @xmath169 km  s@xmath5 predicted by the standard @xmath0cdm structure formation model .",
    "furthermore , the previous studies on the peculiar velocity field for the local group have not found such a large peculiar velocity .",
    "therefore we believe that a possible indication on the aberration effect on the sdss galaxy distribution is not significant , and may be due to residual contaminating effects .",
    "we argued that the dipole direction may be caused , at least partly , by the apparent systematic difference of galaxy number densities between the sdss survey regions of the northern and southern galactic hemispheres ( ngh and sgh , respectively ) , where the sgh region has a smaller average number density than the ngh ( see table  [ tab : samp ] ) .",
    "we found that the number density differences between ngh and sgh does move the direction of the detected dipoles in all the four samples toward the cmb dipole direction , however , the origin of the difference itself is unknown .",
    "the two regions are separated , and the sgh region has a much smaller sky coverage ( 679 deg@xmath143 ) compared with the ngh region ( 6928 deg@xmath143 ) . a data having a wider sky coverage is desired to settle if this difference is real or due to some systematics in our analysis .",
    "another concern is on the galactic dust extinction correction .",
    "indeed , when excluding the sgh data , the preferred dipole directions of all samples more or less move toward the northern galactic pole .",
    "hence we suspect that galactic dust may cause one part of our detection of the dipoles in the three less robust samples other than the bd sample ( another possible part is the number density difference between ngh and sgh ) .",
    "although we have assumed in this paper that the sfd dust map @xcite gives us a perfect dust extinction correction , yahata et al .",
    "@xcite pointed our remaining systematics in low dust extinction regions in the map .",
    "therefore an indication of the dipole anisotropy we found is not yet conclusive .",
    "we quantitatively showed that a survey with almost full - sky coverage and sufficient depth is ideally needed to explore the aberration effect on the galaxy distribution .",
    "future surveys , pan - starrs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/ ) or lsst @xcite , are such a survey and offer a chance to explore the signal . in this paper",
    "we showed that lsst may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect .",
    "even for the effect similar to the cmb dipole amplitude , the angular direction of the aberration effect can be determined with precision of 20 degrees in radius . if the cosmic bulk flow of order @xmath170 km  s@xmath5 implied in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite extends out to the horizon and therefore we are at rest in the matter rest - frame , the lsst survey will provide us a good opportunity for either accepting or rejecting such a bulk flow .",
    "thus lsst may offer a unique chance to constrain the horizon - scale perturbations where some exotic physics related to cosmic acceleration such as dark energy and super - void may play a role .",
    "there are other methods / data - sets that allow to explore the horizon - scale peculiar velocity field relative to the earth s motion .",
    "for instance , using a homogeneous catalog of quasars , such as that of sdss , is advantageous to reduce the intrinsic clustering contamination due to the higher redshift coverage .",
    "however a clean identification of quasars from stellar population from imaging data is always problematic .",
    "also the poisson noise can be significant due to a much smaller number density of quasars .",
    "another interesting method is using the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect that is caused by the peculiar velocities of ionized medium that scatters off cmb photons causing the secondary temperature fluctuations by the doppler shift .",
    "for example , the kinetic sz effect can be extracted by measuring the cmb fluctuations .",
    "the advantage of this method is it allows to directly measure the line - of - sight component of peculiar velocity at the cluster redshift .",
    "in fact there are several attempts to measure the kinetic sz effect by stacking the cmb fluctuations in the sky regions of clusters in order to explore the excess in the temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in particular , kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite reported a possible significant detection of the large - scale bulk flow of @xmath2-ray luminous clusters , implying the bulk flow of @xmath170 km  s@xmath5 , apparently similar to that indicated from our analysis on our faint samples within the uncertainties , in the angular direction not far from the cmb dipole direction ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "based on this surprising result , it was speculated that the large - scale bulk flow may originate from the non - standard horizon - scale perturbations , for example the tilt across the observable universe due to the pre - inflationary inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "this result is , very interesting though , still under debate , and a further analysis will be needed by using a homogeneous massive sample of clusters .",
    "moreover , a high - angular - resolution and high - sensitive cmb measurement has a potential to extract the kinetic sz effect due to the ionized intergalactic medium ( more exactly known as the ostriker - vishniac effect @xcite ) .",
    "thus it would be worth exploring large - scale bulk flow of the universe by combining various methods in order to explore the possible new horizon - scale physics , which is very difficult to explore by other means .",
