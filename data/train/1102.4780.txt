    "during the last decade , relativistic fluid dynamics has been used as one of the main theoretical tools @xcite in the study of the hot and dense matter created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and , most recently , at lhc . while the properties of non - relativistic fluids are now well understood @xcite , the non - trivial physical consequences imposed by causality and stability of relativistic fluids are still under intense theoretical investigation @xcite .    in non - relativistic navier - stokes theory ,",
    "the dissipative currents , such as the bulk viscous pressure , the shear stress tensor , and the heat flow , are assumed to be linearly proportional to the fluid - dynamical forces , such as spatial gradients of fluid velocity , temperature , and chemical potential .",
    "the constants of proportionality are the bulk viscosity , the shear viscosity , and the heat conductivity .",
    "navier - stokes theory can be extended by considering higher - order gradients of fluid velocity , temperature , or chemical potential , leading to the burnett equations ( including second - order gradients ) , the super - burnett equations ( including third - order gradients ) etc .",
    "a systematic derivation of these equations is provided by the gradient expansion .",
    "the first - order truncation of the gradient expansion , i.e. , navier - stokes theory , is stable , but not causal , as it allows for propagation of signals with infinite speed @xcite .",
    "higher - order truncations suffer from the bobylev instability @xcite , and are thus neither stable nor causal .",
    "eckart , and later , landau and lifshitz were the first to attempt a relativistic formulation of fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "their derivation was based on a relativistically covariant extension of traditional navier - stokes theory .",
    "the resulting equations coincide with a first - order truncation of a relativistic formulation of the gradient expansion . unlike the non - relativistic case , however , already the first - order truncation of the gradient expansion , i.e. , the relativistic generalization of navier - stokes theory , is not only acausal but , unfortunately , also unstable @xcite .",
    "israel and stewart @xcite were among the first to formulate a relativistic theory of fluid dynamics that respected causality and was potentially stable .",
    "their formulation was a relativistic extension of grad s theory @xcite , where the fluid - dynamical dissipative currents appear as dynamical variables which relax to the values of navier - stokes theory on characteristic time scales , usually referred to as relaxation times .",
    "thus , unlike for the gradient expansion the dissipative currents in israel - stewart theory ( is ) do not have to be zero in the absence of gradients .",
    "instead , they decay to zero on the time scales given by the relaxation times",
    ".    one of the features of israel - stewart theory is that it reduces to navier - stokes theory in the limit of vanishing relaxation times . in other words , in navier - stokes theory",
    "the dissipative currents relax instantaneously to the values given by the fluid - dynamical forces , which leads to a violation of causality .",
    "for the theory to be causal it is therefore _ necessary _ that the relaxation times assume a non - zero value , but this is _ not sufficient_. it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of bulk and shear viscosity that causality imposes a _ stronger _",
    "constraint for is theories : the ratio of the relaxation times to the viscosity coefficients must _",
    "exceed certain values _ @xcite .",
    "for instance for the case of shear viscosity only , the ratio of shear relaxation time @xmath0 to shear viscosity @xmath1 must obey the relation @xmath2where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the energy density , the thermodynamic pressure , and the velocity of sound , respectively .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for relativistic fluids , the causality condition ( [ asc ] ) also implies stability of the fluid - dynamical equations .",
    "any _ physically meaningful _ theory of fluid dynamics must not be intrinsically unstable , and any relativistic generalization of such a physically meaningful theory must be causal . therefore , eq .  ( asc )",
    "implies that , for any non - zero value of viscosity , one _ can not _ take the limit of vanishing relaxation time . in this sense ,",
    "the transient dynamics of the dissipative currents can not be neglected when dealing with relativistic fluids .",
    "this realization forms the basis for the following discussion .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the equations of motion for dissipative currents in the linear regime .",
    "we show how the linearized equation of motion of any dissipative current is determined once the analytical structure of the associated retarded green s function is known . in the case",
    "that the singularity of the retarded green s function nearest to the origin is a simple pole on the imaginary axis , we prove that equation of motion can be reduced to a relaxation - type equation .",
    "the relaxation time is equal to minus the inverse of the imaginary part of this pole .",
    "we prove that this prescription gives a value for the relaxation time that , under certain simplifying assumptions , coincides with the one derived by matching relativistic fluid dynamics to kinetic theory .",
    "we also demonstrate that attempts to derive the relaxation time from considering the long - wavelength , low - frequency ( i.e. , fluid - dynamical ) limit of the retarded green s function in general fail to give the correct result .",
    "this shows that transient dynamics is determined by the slowest microscopic and not by the fastest fluid - dynamical time scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the notation used throughout this paper . in sec .",

    "we show how the analytical structure of the retarded green s function @xmath29 determines the equation of motion for the current @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we show that the gradient expansion in space - time is actually equivalent to a taylor series in 4-momentum space . for the sake of simplicity , we suppress any dependence on spatial coordinates or , equivalently , on 3-momentum , retaining only the dependence on time @xmath30 and ( complex ) frequency @xmath31 .",
    "the coordinate , or 3-momentum dependence , respectively , will be restored later .",
    "we implicitly work in the rest frame of the fluid , such that the equations of motion do not appear to be relativistically covariant , however , covariance can be restored by a proper lorentz - boost .",
    "let us assume that @xmath32 is analytic in the whole complex @xmath26 plane .",
    "this can be considered as the limiting case when @xmath32 has singularities , but all of them are pushed to infinity by some suitable limiting procedure . in this situation",
    "a taylor expansion of @xmath32 around the origin has infinite convergence radius and thus provides a valid representation of @xmath32 in the whole complex plane , @xmath33using eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ taylor1 ] ) , as well as the fourier representation of dirac s delta function @xmath34 ,   \\label{dirac}\\]]it is straightforward to obtain the general form of @xmath35 , @xmath36substituting eq .",

    "note that the standard gradient expansion does not involve time derivatives of the thermodynamic force .",
    "this is not a problem , since one can always replace time derivatives with spatial gradients using the conservation equations of fluid dynamics .",
    "it is important to remark that when the system exhibits a clear separation between the typical microscopic and macroscopic scales , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , it is possible to truncate the expansion on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ expj ] ) .",
    "a microscopic scale is , for example , the mean - free path in dilute gases .",
    "a macroscopic scale is given by the inverse of the gradient of a macroscopic variable , such as energy density , charge density , or fluid velocity .",
    "note that the thermodynamic force , @xmath11 , is already proportional to a gradient of a macroscopic variable , and thus @xmath42 .",

    "( [ expj ] ) , can be truncated at a given order and one obtains a closed macroscopic theory for the dissipative current @xmath10 .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown how to relate the gradient expansion of the thermodynamical force @xmath11 with the taylor expansion of the green s function @xmath58 .",
    "the viability of the latter required the assumption that the singularities of @xmath58 are pushed to infinity by some suitable limiting procedure .",
    "for instance , if @xmath59 has only support in a region of small @xmath60 , which is well separated from the singularities of @xmath58 , one can devise a limiting procedure that effectively pushes these singularities to infinity .",
    "however , a priori it is not at all clear that @xmath59 has vanishing support in the region of the complex @xmath31 plane , where @xmath61 has singularities .    therefore , we have to consider the case that @xmath62 has some singularities in the complex @xmath31 plane .",
    "this fact necessarily restricts the convergence radius of the taylor expansion .",
    "if the singularities are simple poles , it is better to use a laurent expansion around these poles .      in order to illustrate this",
