    "the source demonstrates quasi - sinusoidal pulse profiles in the 0.2 - 1 kev energy band during all four observations .",
    "the pulsed fraction , defined as ( i@xmath28-i@xmath29)/(i@xmath28+i@xmath29 ) , where i@xmath28 and i@xmath29 represent source intensities at the maximum and minimum of the pulse profile excluding background photons , is somewhat lower during 2001 jun .",

    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ mod_energy_depend ] , there is a significant difference between the pulse profiles at low and high energies .",
    "the peak of the pulse profile in the 0.5 - 1 kev band is shifted compared to that in the 0.2 - 0.5 kev band .",
    "in addition , the pulsed fraction in the 0.5 - 1 kev band ( 12.8@xmath302.1% ) appears to be higher than that at lower energies ( 7.5@xmath301.2% ) .",
    "the source is also variable on a time scales of hours during all _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the characteristic timescale of the variability varies between @xmath06000 s and @xmath08000 s. this variability can be either aperiodic or quasi - periodic : the existing observations are not long enough to make a definitive conclusion on its nature . the analysis of the long , 2001 oct .",
    "5 _ chandra_/acis - s observation reveals somewhat similar variability on a time scale of @xmath014000 s.      the pulse phase averaged spectra of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 source are extremely soft , with only a small fraction of photons detected above 1 kev ( fig . [ spec_fig ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the source spectra can not be adequately fit with a single soft spectral component ( i.e. blackbody or other thermal models ) : an additional hard component is required to approximate the excess at higher energies ( distefano et al . 2004 ; orio 2006 ) .",
    "we used a sum of the absorbed blackbody and power law models to approximate epic - pn and mos spectra in the 0.2 - 3 kev energy range ( fig .",
    "[ spec_fig ] ) .",
    "the best - fit spectral model parameters are shown in table [ timing_spec_par ] .",
    "the soft blackbody component has characteristic temperatures @xmath3162 - 67 ev and emitting radii @xmath32 km , and estimated bolometric luminosity @xmath33 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the hard power law component is relatively weak , contributing less than 1% of the total flux in the 0.2 - 1 kev energy range .",
    "the photon index of the power law component is poorly constrained for all four observations : the overall quality of the fit and soft component parameters are not particularly sensitive to the choice of the photon index .",
    "the equivalent absorbing column required by these model fits , @xmath34 @xmath35 is somewhat higher than the expected foreground column in m31 direction @xmath36 @xmath35 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "although our simple two - component model provides good overall description of the source spectra , the relatively high reduced @xmath371.2 - 1.7 of the fits suggest a more structured shape of the source spectrum and a need for an additional components ( see also orio 2006 ) .",
    "the approximation with the sum of absorbed blackbody and power law models leaves bump - like residuals in the 0.3 - 0.8 kev energy range , especially evident in the higher quality 2002 jan .",
    "6 data ( fig .",
    "[ spec_fig ] ) .",
    "these residuals can indicate the presence of discrete emission / absorption features intrinsic to the source , or be a result of incomplete spectral background subtraction ( the source is embedded in the bright unresolved emission , that have a soft thermal spectrum rich in emission lines ( shirey et al .",
    "2001 ) ) .    to investigate the effect of additional discrete model features on the continuum spectral parameters",
    ", we added a gaussian line to the existing two - component model , and used it to approximate epic - pn spectrum of 2002 jan . 6 observation .",
    "the addition of the gaussian line at @xmath00.53 kev greatly improved the quality of spectral fit ( @xmath38(143 dof ) with @xmath39 for 3 additional parameters ) , and led to a significant change in the soft component temperature and emitting radius : @xmath40 ev , @xmath41 km and an absorbing column depth , n@xmath42 @xmath35 . as a result ,",
    "the estimated bolometric luminosity of the source dropped from @xmath43 ergs s@xmath3 to @xmath44 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the application of this model to the data of 2000 jun .",
    "25 observation yields similar results : @xmath45 ev , @xmath46 km , n@xmath47 @xmath35 and bolometric luminosity of @xmath48 ergs s@xmath3 with @xmath49 for 111 dof .",
    "we also tried to add a set of the discrete absorption features ( absorption lines and edges ) to the original two - component model .",
    "this approach produced similar results : increase of the blackbody model temperature @xmath50 ev and decrease of the emitting radius @xmath51 km , and overall decrease of the bolometric luminosity to @xmath52 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "this is yet another demonstration of the huge uncertainty of sss luminosity estimates , that has poorly understood systematic component determined by the quality of instrument calibration , background subtraction , foreground absorbing column estimation and choice of spectral model .",
    "this uncertainty extends well beyond standard statistical errors of the absorbed simple blackbody fits , usually adopted in the spectral analysis of ssss , and can affect final conclusions about their properties . in the case of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 ,",
    "a simple two - component model fits result in the estimated source luminosities that are super - eddington assuming 1.4 m@xmath9 compact object accreting hydrogen - rich material ( distefano et al .",
    "2004 ; orio 2006 , this work ) .",
    "recently , orio ( 2006 ) performed spectral analysis of _ xmm_/epic - mos data on xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 and obtained the lower limit on the source bolometric luminosity of @xmath53 ergs s@xmath3 for 2001 june 29 and 2002 jan .",
    "6 observations , and suggested that the source could be linked to the ultraluminous supersoft x - ray sources found in other nearby galaxies and interpreted as imbh candidates ( kong & distefano 2005 ) . our analysis of the same datasets yields consistently lower source luminosity estimates ( @xmath54 ergs s@xmath3 ) for the same model approximation ,",
    "that become even lower ( @xmath55 ergs s@xmath3 ) when a more complex models are used for spectral fitting .",
    "the x - ray pulsations and supersoft spectrum of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 imply that it is almost certainly an accreting white dwarf in a binary system .",
    "the 217.7 s pulsation period is the shortest known among ssss to date .",
    "it is too short to be interpreted as binary orbital period even for a double - degenerate system .",
    "the remaining possible explanations for the observed modulation include stellar rotation and non - radial @xmath56-mode pulsations of the white dwarf .",
    "periodic variations on a time scales of 1000 - 2500 s have been recently detected in the postnova ssss ( drake et al .",
    "2003 ; ness et al . 2003 ) and in one of the prototype sss , cal 83 ( schmidtke & cowley 2006 ) , and interpreted as a signature of non - radial pulsations of the white dwarf . in the case of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 , the short period , long - term stability of the modulation and the absence of multi - periodicity argue against that interpretation .",
    "therefore , it is more plausible to assume that the observed modulation results from rotation of a magnetized accreting white dwarf",
    ". the strength of the wd magnetic field should not be extremely high , so its spin and orbital periods are not locked .",
    "the energy spectrum of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 is typical for luminous supersoft x - ray sources and soft intermediate polars . assuming the source is located in m31 , its observed luminosity ( @xmath57 ergs s@xmath3 ) is too high for intermediate polars ( haberl & motch 1995 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of a bright optical counterpart makes the interpretation of the source as galactic foreground system unlikely .",
    "the remaining possibility is that xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 is a luminous supersoft source located in m31 . in that case ,",
    "xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 is the second m31 sss with coherent x - ray pulsations detected , after the supersoft transient xmmu j004319.4 + 411758 showing pulsations with 865.5 s period ( osborne et al .",
    "2001 ; king et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the results of our spectral analysis suggest that the estimated source luminosity is probably close or may slightly exceed the isotropic eddington luminosity for a typical white dwarfs . assuming that the source luminosity ( @xmath55 ergs s@xmath3 ) is produced in the process of burning of the hydrogen - rich material on the wd surface",
    ", we can estimate the required accretion rate as @xmath58 m@xmath9 year@xmath3 or @xmath59 g s@xmath3 ( assuming the energy yield of nuclear burning 0.007@xmath60 ) .",
    "such a high accretion rate would imply either roche lobe thermal time scale mass transfer from a near - main - sequence companion with a mass larger than that of the wd , or a mass transfer in a wide symbiotic ( wd+red giant ) system ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ; kahabka & van den heuvel 2006 ) .",
    "if the x - ray pulsations observed in xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 result from rotation of a magnetized wd , accreting from the keplerian disk ( king et al .",
    "2002 ) , one can estimate the strength @xmath61 of the wd magnetic field . assuming a dipole configuration of the pulsator magnetic field , the magnetospheric radius inside which the accretion flow is channeled by the field is ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ; lamb , pethick & pines 1973 ; ghosh & lamb 1979a ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the accretion rate through the disk , @xmath64 is a wd mass , @xmath65 is the magnetic moment of the wd , @xmath66 g s@xmath3 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 g @xmath69 .",

    "ideally , most of the hydrogen burning is expected to occur near the poles ( king et al .",
    "2002 ) , creating bright hot spots .",
    "the observed energy dependence of the pulse profile supports this picture , suggesting a higher temperature of the emitting region responsible for the modulation .",
    "the estimated fractional polar cap area @xmath86 ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ) implies a relatively large size of the accretion ( hot spot ) region , in agreement with quasi - sinusoidal pulse profile and low amplitude of the modulation ( @xmath010% ) .    in the accretion process , angular momentum is transferred to the white dwarf and its rotation period should change ( pringle & rees 1972 ; rappaport & joss 1977 ; ghosh & lamb 1979b ) . assuming that disk accretion is occurring in the system , and that all the specific angular momentum of the accreting material is transferred to the white dwarf at the magnetospheric radius @xmath87 , one can estimate maximum rate of change of the spin period as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the moment of inertia of the white dwarf in units of @xmath90 g @xmath91 . for the typical white dwarf parameters ( @xmath92 , @xmath82 ) , the observed spin period of @xmath81 s , and @xmath93 , the estimated spin - up rate is @xmath940.065 s yr@xmath3 .",

    "<S> we report on the discovery of a periodic modulation in the bright supersoft x - ray source xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 detected in the 2000 - 2004 _ xmm - newton _ observations of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the source exhibits x - ray pulsations with a period p@xmath0217.7 s and a quasi - sinusoidal pulse shape and pulsed fraction @xmath07 - 11% . </S>",
    "<S> we did not detect statistically significant changes in the pulsation period on the time scale of 4 years . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 are extremely soft and can be approximated with an absorbed blackbody of temperature 62 - 77 ev and a weak power law tail of photon index @xmath11.7 - 3.1 in the 0.2 - 3.0 kev energy band . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray properties of the source and the absence of an optical / uv counterpart brighter than 19 mag suggest that it belongs to m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated bolometric luminosity of the source varies between @xmath02@xmath2 and @xmath08@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 at 760 kpc , depending on the choice of spectral model . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray pulsations and supersoft spectrum of xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 imply that it is almost certainly an accreting white dwarf , steadily burning hydrogen - rich material on its surface . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret x - ray pulsations as a signature of the strong magnetic field of the rotating white dwarf . assuming that the x - ray source is powered by disk accretion </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate its surface field strength to be in the range @xmath4 g @xmath5 g. </S>",
    "<S> xmmu j004252.5 + 411540 is the second supersoft x - ray source in m31 showing coherent pulsations , after the transient supersoft source xmmu j004319.4 + 411758 with 865.5 s pulsation period . </S>"
