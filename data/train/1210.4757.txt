    "solar flares are one of the most energetic processes which occur in the solar system .",
    "however the details of the acceleration processes responsible are still poorly known .",
    "the x - rays which are observed at the earth are commonly produced by the accelerated electrons interacting with the solar plasma and producing bremsstrahlung radiation . to understand solar flares it is therefore important to understand the distribution of these accelerated electrons . in general",
    ", this distribution will vary in space , energy and in pitch angle ( see , , as the recent reviews of electron properties in solar flares ) .",
    "several techniques have been used to estimate the anisotropy in the pitch - angle distribution of x - ray emitting electrons in solar flares @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used method is to look at the centre - to - limb variation of solar x - ray properties @xcite .",
    "that is comparing the characteristics , most commonly total x - ray flux @xcite , or the spectral index of solar flares at the limb to disk centre events .",
    "studies concentrating on lower energy emission ( below 300 kev ) tended to find no significant evidence of directivity .",
    "these studies have also been performed using smm data @xcite studying flares with energies above 300 kev @xcite .",
    "some evidence for directivity at high energies has been reported @xcite .",
    "more recently rhessi ( ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ) data @xcite has been used to determine the x - ray anisotropy .",
    "an obvious disadvantage of the statistical method is that the variation can only be seen as an average over a large number of solar flares , so little can be said about x - ray or electron anisotropy in a given flare .",
    "an approach which allows individual flares to be studied is the stereoscopic method @xcite . here",
    "each individual flare is measured directly by two spacecraft at two different locations , ideally well separated in space .",
    "studies that have been performed using this method do not show any clear evidence of directivity @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty in cross calibrating , often leading to large errors .",
    "another drawback is , as in the centre - to - limb method , this technique does not give direct information about the downward electron distribution .    as an anisotropic electron distribution will produce polarised x - rays , measuring",
    "the polarisation can therefore give a measure of the anisotropy of the electron distribution @xcite .",
    "an isotropic source should show low polarisation , whereas a beam should produce significant polarisation @xcite .",
    "studies of polarisation have been performed using various x - ray satellites , recently using the _ coronas - f _",
    "satellite @xcite .",
    "the reported measurements vary substantially from observation to observation , adding to the scepticism of these measurements .",
    "a major drawback of this approach is the observational difficulty in measuring polarisation at hxr energies for transient events like solar flares .",
    "several attempts have been made using rhessi @xcite , but so far there have been no conclusive measurements made .",
    "hxr polarisation has not yet been used to its full potential and future observations could provide a more definitive answer .    another important process , which can be used to diagnose the angular distribution , is photospheric albedo @xcite .",
    "photospheric albedo of x - rays results from initially downward directed x - rays , which are compton scattered off electrons in the solar photosphere , being observed at earth .",
    "this effect distorts the hxr spectrum @xcite and leads to an appearance of apparent low energy cutoff in the deduced electron spectrum @xcite , when the observed x - ray spectrum is not corrected for an albedo .",
    "as the spectral shapes of reflected and primary hard x - ray spectra are sufficiently distinct , these two components can be distinguished and the albedo reflected flux could be used as a measure of the downward going electrons ( figure 1 ) .",
    "rhessi provides sufficient energy resolution , broad energy coverage , and sensitivity to better constrain directivity of energetic electrons in individual solar flare events .",
    "here we use this albedo method to examine the directivity of energetic electrons in solar flares .",
    "we first perform some forward modelling to examine the effect directivity of the electron spectrum and the role of the albedo contribution has on solar flare spectra .",
    "the rhessi flare catalogue has been searched for suitable flares between 2002 and 2008 and we use the spectral data from the impulsive phases of several well observed flares to perform a bi - directional inversion , estimating the fluxes of electrons travelling towards and away from the photosphere .",
    "the spatially integrated x - ray photon flux spectrum at the earth @xmath5 , [ photons  @xmath6  s@xmath7  kev@xmath7 ] is straightforwardly related to the mean electron flux spectrum of energetic electron @xmath9 [ electrons  @xmath6  s@xmath7  kev@xmath7  sr@xmath7 ] via the linear integral relation ( e.g. , ) . for a given electron distribution @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron pitch angle , the resulting emitted x - ray flux at distance @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the source volume , @xmath14 is the mean plasma density , @xmath15 is the angular dependant bremsstrahlung cross - section , @xmath16 is photon energy , @xmath17 is electron energy and @xmath18 is the angle between the initial electron velocity vector and the direction of the emitted photon .",
    "the cross - section used here is the electron - ion cross section , formula 2bn from with coulomb correction by added .",
    "the relation between the angles @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath20 is the angle between the emitted photon and the direction of the photosphere .",
    "the exact plasma density distribution @xmath23 and flaring volume @xmath13 are often poorly known and therefore it is preferable if the value @xmath24 is inferred , this is the mean electron flux spectrum @xcite , a density weighted electron flux , multiplied by @xmath25 the number of electrons in the emitting volume .",
    "this value is model independent , and its detailed structure can be related to the electron acceleration and propagation physics which is central to the understanding of solar flares .",
    "is approximated by downward @xmath26 and upward @xmath27 going electrons . ]    the electron distribution of emitting electrons is assumed to be separable in energy and angle .",
    "the energy dependence is taken to be a single power - law as solar flare x - ray observations are often well fit by power laws implying close to power - law electron spectra .",
    "for simplicity the pitch angle distribution is taken to be a gaussian beam centred downwards .",
    "this pitch angle distribution is assumed as electrons tend to stream along magnetic field lines resulting in a downwards beam , and the gaussian parametrization of this is popular as it has useful analytic properties .",
    "the total distribution has the form similar to @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 characterises the width of the gaussian .",
    "it should be noted that equation  ( 3 ) refers to the mean electron flux spectrum not the injected electron spectrum considered in .",
    "three different cases were assumed for the angular variation of the electron spectrum ( figure 2 ) : the isotropic case ( @xmath31 ) , an intermediate anisotropic case ( @xmath32 ) and a highly beamed case ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the electron spectral index @xmath34 was assumed to be @xmath35 as the typical flare spectral index of x - rays in large flares is around @xmath36 ( see e.g. ) and for the mean electron flux spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "as the assumed electron distribution has azimuthal symmetry an average cross - section integrated over @xmath21 can immediately be defined leaving only the angles @xmath20 and @xmath19 needed to characterise the angular distribution ( c.f . )",
    "@xmath38    the angular distribution of the emitted x - rays with respect to the downward direction can now be found by applying this cross section to the assumed electron spectrum and integrating over electron energy and pitch angle ( figure 3 ) @xmath39    the primary emission observed for a flare at heliocentric angle @xmath40 is expected to come from a small range in angle in the direction of the observer .",
    "considering the geometry , it is clear that the upward directed photon distribution can be approximated as @xmath41 the albedo reflected component , on the other hand , results from the photons directed down towards the photosphere .",
    "this is likely to be a broader distribution so an average is taken over a downwards directed cone concentric with the mean direction of the electron distribution and with half angle @xmath42 , in this study a value of @xmath43 is used .",
    "the downward directed flux can then be defined as @xmath44    the reflected component , due to albedo , of a given x - ray spectrum incident on the photosphere can be characterised by using a green s function @xmath45 dependant on observation angle @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus , the total observed x - ray spectrum will be given by the sum of the directly observed and reflected components : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are upward and downward directed components ( figure 6 ) .    in practice",
    "the photon spectrum is calculated numerically with a finite resolution . for energy a pseudo - logarithmic binning scheme with 100 bins starting at @xmath0 kev and going up to 5  mev",
    "is used for both electrons and photons . due to the highly anisotropic nature of the cross - section at high energies fine resolution in angle was needed . angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 were binned in 90 evenly spaced bins between 0 and @xmath51 whereas @xmath21 was binned in 180 evenly spaced bins between 0 and @xmath52 .",
    "the upward and downward components of the photon flux are now given by vectors .",
    "the observer directed component is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 corresponds to the centre energy of the photon bin and @xmath23 is the number of bins in photons space .",
    "the photosphere directed component is given by @xmath55 defined in the same way .",
    "similarly the angle dependant green s function is here calculated in the form of a @xmath56 green s matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the vector representing the total observed flux is simply given by @xmath58 where @xmath45 is the albedo matrix constructed from green s functions .      due to the effect of albedo one of the most notable variations with changing anisotropy is in the photon spectral index , the derivative with respect to energy of the photon flux .",

    "this flare also has an attenuator status change from a0 to a1 at 14:52:43 ut and to a3 at 14:54:16 ut , so the impulsive phase is taken to be a 32 s time interval between 14:52:47 and 14:53:19 ut .",
    "this flare was detected on 17th june 2003 starting at approximately 22:30 ut .",

    "this flare was detected on 15th january 2005 .",
    "it was detected with a heliocentric angle of @xmath135 equivalent to @xmath136 , the closest of all the flares selected to the disk centre and therefore the most likely to show evidence of strong downwards directivity .",

    "this flare was detected on 17th january 2005 between 09:30 and 15:15 ut with the impulsive peak starting about 09:42 ut .",
    "it was detected with a heliocentric angle of @xmath137 equivalent to @xmath138 .",
    "the flare also shows good count statistics up to 300 kev .",
    "as this flare occurs in the tail of a previous flare is has very high background at low energies .",
    "counts below 18 kev were not accumulated for this flare .",
    "this flare was also previously analysed using bi - directional inversion .",
    "this flare was detected on 10th september 2005 .",
    "it was detected with a heliocentric angle of @xmath139 equivalent to @xmath134 .",
    "this flare showed negligible particle contamination and a low probability of pulse pileup .",
    "the flare also shows good count statistics up to 300 kev . due to changes in the attenuator status during the impulsive phase from a1 to a3 at 21:34:12 ut and the maximum time interval studied for this flare",
    "is 32 s starting at 21:34:26 ut .",
    "four seconds is roughly the rotation period of rhessi and thus the shortest time interval studied here .",
    "longer time intervals of 8 , 16 , and 32 seconds were also studied for some flares depending on the length of the impulsive phase .",
    "the results for these time intervals are very similar to the results for the full impulsive phase .",
    "the inversions for short time intervals generally show confidence intervals around an anisotropy of 1 at the @xmath140 level extending to around 2 below 100 kev and sharply increasing above that . as the count statistics are lower for the shorter time intervals the confidence intervals are wider than for the full impulsive phase .",
    "there was no discernible statistically significant variation in the level of anisotropy for the duration of the impulsive phase .",
    "as an example the anisotropies for each of the 4 second time intervals for the flare on 10th november 2004 are shown in figure  [ fig : as - panels ] .",
    "this analysis shows consistently that for almost all flares studied by rhessi that the recovered @xmath141 is close to unity within the confidence intervals being consistent with an isotropic pitch angle distribution . for almost every flare downward beaming of a ratio greater than @xmath142",
    "is ruled out to @xmath143 confidence below @xmath144 kev .",
    "the only clear exception to this is the flare on 20th august 2002 between 30 and 50 kev , where the recovered flux appears to be inconsistent with isotropic at the 3-@xmath145 level and suggest a slightly greater ( @xmath146 ) upward flux .",
    "this flare is unusual in several respects .",
    "there is a high level of particle contamination throughout the impulsive phase .",
    "several background subtractions were examined to attempt to account for this .",
    "this flare is also one of the flattest flares studied , which makes pileup correction more difficult to estimate .",
    "also , this is one of only two flares studied where the attenuator status was a1 for the examined time interval .",
    "these measurements appear to rule out any strong beaming such as would be expected in the basic collisional thick target model .",
    "however as only two components are recovered and the confidence intervals can be fairly large using this method , the observations are consistent with a range of possible pitch angle distributions including fully isotropic distributions , pancake distributions and weak beaming below the measured confidence level .",
    "the size of the uncertainties could be reduced with better count statistics and better energy resolution as each of these distributions does show different spectral variation .",
    "the forward modelling shows very clearly that when there is significant beaming in the emitting electron population it will result in a very strong albedo emission . for many cases with substantial",
    "beaming , particularly close to the disk centre , the albedo component can dominate over the primary component . in order to directly compare the measured results to the forward model",
    "a plot of @xmath147 against anisotropy ( @xmath148 ) is included ( figure  [ fig : delmu ] ) both for the functional form described by equation 3 and for another commonly used form @xmath149 .",
    "it should be stressed that the results in figures  [ fig : a - panels ] and [ fig : as - panels ] are model independent and can be interpreted in terms of a variety of models , including , but not limited to those considered in figure  [ fig : delmu ] .",
    "these results are consistent with previous published results which showed little evidence of directivity below 300 kev .",
    "it should be noted that this study measures anisotropy in terms of the electron flux , whereas for other types of study the parametrisation of anisotropy is often in terms of the directivity of the x - ray emission for stereoscopic studies and the centre - to - limb variance for statistical studies .",
    "these are generally related to the electron anisotropy in a model dependant manner . as the x - ray emission can be quite broad , particularly for low energies , a large anisotropy in the electron spectrum could result in a low photon spectrum directivity .",
    "performed a centre - to - limb study using rhessi data and inferred a directivity ratio between 0.2 and 5 in the range 15 - 20 kev .",
    "as the emission below @xmath150 is expected to be predominantly produced by thermal electrons it is expected that the distribution in this energy range should be isotropic . this is particularly true for the flares on 17 june 2003 and 10 november 2004 which show strong thermal components however this may not be the case for flares which show a weak thermal component such as the flare on 20 august 2002 .",
    "as this study measured x - rays in the energy range 10 - 500 kev the reliability of the inversion above approximately 250 kev is questionable .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : a - panels ] the confidence interval increases significantly at a few hundred kev .",
    "thus it is difficult to make comparisons with the smm studies which examined x - ray measurements above 300 kev .",
    "however the measurements in this study are for the most part in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "as electrons propagate through the corona and chromosphere they will be pitch angle scattered by coulomb collisions ( e.g. ; ) , although it seems that collisions will be insufficient to isotropise an initially beamed distribution @xcite .",
    "these results , therefore , suggest that either the accelerated electron population is more isotropic , or other transport effects are more important than anticipated .",
    "specifically , the electron scattering by various wave - particle interactions could increase the pitch angle spread of the energetic electrons .",
    "further , if the distribution of energetic electrons is close to isotropic , the role of return current should be diminished .",
    "in addition we note , that although the return current itself does contribute to the formation of a backward going beam , it is likely to be more efficient at energies below @xmath151 kev , so that the higher energy electrons are expected to be weakly affected @xcite ."
