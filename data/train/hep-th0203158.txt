    "the abelian 2-form gauge potential , usually referred to as kalb - ramond field ( k - r ) , exhibits a number of interesting features in four dimensional space - time ( 4d ) @xcite ; special emphasis is given to the fact that it mixes up with the electromagnetic gauge potential so as to yield a massive spin-1 excitation based on a @xmath0 ^2$]-symmetry , without the need for higgs scalars @xcite .",
    "more recently , the coupling between the k - r and maxwell fields has been reconsidered in connection with the issue of dirac - like monopoles with massive photons @xcite .",
    "also , interesting discussions on the possible non - abelian extension of the k - r field are set in the works of ref .",
    "@xcite .    reassessing the k - r field in three dimensional space - time ( 3d ) brings about some peculiarities that show up as a by - product of three dimensional space - time .",
    "for example , the abelian gauge field dual to the k - r potential in 3d is subject to a particular gauge symmetry that selects its longitudinal component as the physical propagating mode , whereas its transverse part appears as a compensating mode , and so it can always be gauged away .",
    "once the mass - shell condition is imposed , no physical propagating degree of freedom survives and we have the peculiarity that the k - r gauge field carries _ no _ on - shell degrees of freedom in @xmath1d @xcite .",
    "we understand that this is a consequence of setting its dynamics on a flat space - time .",
    "so , our propose is to set out this paper in order to illustrate how the coupling of the k - r field to the 3d counterpart of the einstein - hilbert gravity excites a massive scalar mode in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "this is a result that already emerges at classical level .",
    "the main motivation of our work is to compute 1-loop corrections to the k - r field self - energy , so as to understand how these effects change the mass spectrum set up at tree - level .",
    "we pursue our investigation in the cases of ordinary ( torsionless ) gravity ( section 2 ) and , later on , we go over to the general case of gravity with torsion ( section 3 ) @xcite .",
    "we find some peculiarities at the end of our analysis and we shall comment on them in our conclusive comments ( section 4 ) .",
    "the model we contemplate accounts for the non - minimal coupling of @xmath1d - gravity to the k - r field according to the lagrangian density given below : @xmath2 where the first term is the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian : @xmath3 notice the absence of the overall minus sign that appears in @xmath4d - gravity : in @xmath1d , this must be the choice in such a way to avoid that the graviton becomes a ghost .",
    "the second term describes the lagrangian for the antisymmetric gauge field @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a @xmath1-form written in terms of the potential @xmath5 as follows : @xmath8 the last term accounts for the interaction between gravity and the gauge field : @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the totally antisymmetric symbol , while @xmath12 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 carries dimension of ( mass)@xmath14 .",
    "to analyse the espectrum of the model , we consider the linearised approximation of the full theory .",
    "this consists in the expansion of the metric field around the flat background as below : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the perturbation associated to the graviton field .    as for the @xmath17-form gauge potential , it is more convenient to parametrise it in terms of its dual , @xmath18 . doing so , the gauge transformation for @xmath5 can be rephrased as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath1-vector gauge parameter .    in order to invert the wave operator that mixes @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath21 in the bilinear piece of the action , we fix the de donder gauge for @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24    on the other hand , the gauge transformations ( @xmath25 ) for @xmath21 suggests the following gauge - fixing term for the abelian symmetry associated to @xmath5 : @xmath26    with these elements , the bilinear piece of the action can be cast under the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the differential wave operator to be inverted to give us the graviton and the gauge field propagators .",
    "this operator can be decomposed in four sectors , namely , @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where the @xmath35s are the barnes - rivers projector operators for symmetric second - rank tensors in d=3 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the transverse and longitudinal operators for vectors .",
    "the propagators are given by @xmath38 \\right| 0\\right\\rangle = i\\left ( \\mathcal{o}^{-1}\\right ) _ { \\alpha \\beta } \\delta ^{3}\\left ( x - y\\right ) ,   \\label{2.25}\\ ] ] where wave operator is inverted by using of the multiplicative relations satisfied by the projectors @xcite . in so doing ,",
    "the propagators in momentum space read as follows : @xmath39 } { \\left ( p^{2}-m^{2}\\right ) } p^{\\left ( 0-w\\right ) } \\right .",
    "\\\\ & & -\\left .",
    "\\frac{m^{2}}{\\left ( p^{2}-m^{2}\\right ) } \\left [ p^{\\left ( 0-s\\right ) } + \\sqrt{2}\\left ( p^{\\left ( 0-sw\\right ) } + p^{\\left ( 0-ws\\right ) } \\right ) \\right ] \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath40    @xmath41 where @xmath42 and we have suppressed the indices in @xmath16 and in the @xmath43 projectors .    the above propagators display poles at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so that tachyons do not show up . the next step is a investigation of the possibility that negative - norm state might be present .",
    "a necessary criterium for unitarity at tree - level is analysed by saturating the propagator with external currents @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( for the graviton and the gauge field , respectively ) , compatible with the gauge symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "ghosts are absent in the model if the imaginary part of the residue of the current - current transition amplitude taken at the propagator poles is non - negative . for the graviton ,",
    "this amplitude in momentum space is written as @xmath48 \\right\\rangle j^{\\kappa \\lambda } \\left ( p\\right ) ,   \\label{2.29}\\ ] ] where , by virtue of the transversality of @xmath49 , only the spin projectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 survive .",
    "this fact enable us to write the imaginary part of the residue of the transition amplitude at the pole @xmath44 as @xmath52    now , defining the following set of independent vectors in momentum space , @xmath53 that satisfy the conditions : @xmath54 the symmetric tensor current @xmath55can be decomposed according to : @xmath56    substituting ( [ 2.33 ] ) into ( [ 2.30 ] ) , and making use the relations ( [ 2.31 ] ) and ( [ 2.32 ] ) , we find that @xmath57 , showing that the massless pole does not propagate . for the pole at @xmath58 , one obtains @xmath59 that is always positive - definite .",
    "from this result , we find only one on - shell degree of freedom for the massive graviton .    for the vector field ,",
    "the transition amplitude is given by @xmath60 \\right\\rangle j^\\nu \\left ( p\\right ) .",
    "\\label{2.35}\\ ] ] expanding the current @xmath61 with respect to the basis ( [ 2.31 ] ) , @xmath62 and by making use of its conservation law , @xmath63 we can show that the massless pole is again non - dynamical , while the residue of the amplitude at the massive pole give us : @xmath64 which ensures one physical degree of freedom . therefore , the non - minimal coupling of the k - r field to gravity results in a appearance of a dynamical massive pole in the longitudinal sector of @xmath5 .",
    "we now turn into the calculation of the 1-loop mass correction for the gauge field propagator .",
    "the relevant vertices to our discussion are shown in figure 1 , while all possible self - energy corrections are depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the vertices of the figures 1.a and 1.b come from the lagrangians ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) by expanding the metric up to order @xmath65 , while the one of figure 1.c is obtained from ( [ 2.3 ] ) up to order @xmath66 .    from the feynman rules displayed in figure 1 , the contribution coming from the loop integrals can be evaluated . due to algebraic complexity of the vertices and propagators , the explicit evaluation of these diagrams only was possible by means of the software form .",
    "since we are concerned with the contribution to the vector field mass , and we checked that a chern - simons - like term is _ not _ generated , we can calculate the diagrams by setting all momenta appearing on the external legs to zero .",
    "one therefore , obtains the following contribution to the 1-loop shift in the gauge field mass : @xmath67",
    "now , following the same procedure as the one in the previous section , we propose to extend our analysis to the case where torsion is non - vanishing . in three - dimensional space - time",
    ", the torsion field can be covariantly split according to its so(1,2 ) irreducible components : @xmath68 namely , a trace part @xmath69 @xmath70 , a totally antisymmetric part @xmath71 and a traceless rank-2 symmetric tensor @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "a possible gauge - invariant action may be so chosen that there is no coupling at all between the k - r field and torsion , i.e. , the former `` neither yields nor feels torsion '' .",
    "thus , let us consider the action @xmath73 where the tilde on @xmath74 means that we are considering only the riemaniann part of the covariant derivative .",
    "varying the total action ( [ 3.2 ] ) with respect to the independent fields , we get the following result for the trace part of the torsion : @xmath75 while the variations with respect to the fields @xmath76 and @xmath72 give us @xmath77 the torsion irreducible components act as mere auxiliary fields and one can eliminate them by means of their respective algebraic field equations . therefore , substituing this results back into the action , one obtain a lagrangian expressed exclusively in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath16 : @xmath78    from the bilinear sector of the lagrangian above supplemented by the gauge fixing terms ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 2.17 ] ) , we obtain the following propagators : @xmath79 p^{\\left ( 0-w\\right ) } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left .",
    "\\left ( 1+\\frac{p^2}{m^2}\\right ) \\left [ p^{\\left ( 0-s\\right ) } + \\sqrt{2}\\left ( p^{\\left ( 0-sw\\right ) } + p^{\\left ( 0-ws\\right ) } \\right ) \\right ] \\right\\ } ,   \\label{3.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath80    it is remarkable to notice now that the poles are located at @xmath44 , contrary to the previous case , where torsion was not present .",
    "it is just the last term of the action ( [ 3.5 ] ) the responsible for the suppression of the massive pole .",
    "the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath21 arising from the mentioned term appears with the right coefficient that eliminates the massive pole .    proceeding analogously to what we did in the previous section ,",
    "the massless poles are shown to be non - dynamical for both fields . from this result ,",
    "one concludes that the coupling of the k - r field to gravity with non - vanishing torsion may result in a theory without on - shell degrees of freedom at tree - level as long as the action ( [ 3.5 ] ) is concerned .",
    "moreover , by computing the feynman rules for this action and calculating the 1-loop self - energy graphs , we checked that no mass is dynamically generated by radiative corrections .",
    "as a final result , we can state that the coupling of the 3d k - r field with einstein - hilbert gravity excites a dynamical mode of the rank-2 gauge potential , whenever torsion is not considered .",
    "the inclusion of torsion as a non - dynamical field changes this result , as we checked in section 3 .",
    "however , had we considered non - minimal couplings with higher powers in the curvature , the situation would be completely changed , as torsion would become dynamical and its mixing with the graviton @xcite would for sure trigger a dynamical mass for the gauge field on the basis of the results worked out in section 2 .    to conclude , we would like to mention that , if gravity were described by a pure chern - simons term , even in the torsionless case the k - r field would remain non - dynamical on - shell , since no mass would be generated neither at the classical nor at the 1-loop level .",
