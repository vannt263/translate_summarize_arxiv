    "to make effective use of bright time , ground - based optical telescopes are generally used to observe either sufficiently bright objects in the optical ( @xmath0 mag  arcsec@xmath1 ) or to observe in the near infrared . in the first case , this is to avoid being background limited by the moonlit sky , and in the second case , the sky background is dominated by oh line emissionm   wavelength range , then background continuum becomes important and dark time conditions may then be preferable . ] or thermal emission from the sky and telescope . for many telescopes",
    ", the observatory budget does not extend to expensive high - resolution optical spectrographs or infrared instruments which are suitable for bright - time observations .",
    "some of these telescopes have formed consortia which span the globe to undertake monitoring of variable sources ( e.g. , pulsating stars , microlensing events , asteroids ) .    in this paper , we look at strategies for observing during bright time that allow background - limited objects to be observed with higher efficiency .",
    "we also look at the possibility of improving observations during twilight . in the optical ,",
    "the moonlit sky is generally darker along sight lines at large angles from the moon .",
    "additionally , when the moon is near ninety degrees away , the scattered moonlight is highly polarised . by using a polarising filter oriented at the correct angle , the sky background",
    "can then be reduced to near - dark or grey conditions .",
    "the degree of polarisation can be defined as @xmath2 where : @xmath3 is the polarised intensity and @xmath4 is the unpolarised intensity , or ; @xmath5 is the maximum intensity as measured in one plane of polarisation and @xmath6 is the intensity in the orthogonal plane .",
    "studies of the polarisation of twilight ( e.g. , coulson 1980 , wu & lu 1988 ) have shown that scattered sunlight at ninety degrees has a degree of polarisation of about 0.85 .",
    "moonlight scattered at ninety degrees could have a slightly higher degree of polarisation since the light is partially polarised on reflection from the moon ( e.g. , dollfus 1962 ) .",
    "the next section quantifies observing efficiency for poisson - noise limited observations , and determines the gain factor when using a polariser .",
    "sections  [ sec : obs - moonlit ] and  [ sec : obs - twilight ] discuss observations in moonlight and twilight with and without a polariser .",
    "a figure of merit ( proportional to observing efficiency ) , for a particular instrument observing an object of a certain flux , can be defined as the signal - to - noise ratio squared ( @xmath7 ) divided by the integration time ( @xmath8 ) . ignoring read - out noise ,",

    "is then given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transmission of the polariser with unpolarised light ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the efficiency of the telescope and instrument with polarised light , @xmath19 is the extinction of the polariser ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 is the degree of polarisation of the extra light .    the gain in observing efficiency from using a polariser can be written as @xmath22 \\ : .",

    "[ sec : polarisers ] ) .",
    "the degree of polarisation could be about 0.90 for moonlight scattered from the sky ninety degrees away from the moon .",
    "the extinction should not be a limiting factor with @xmath19 in the range @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "setting @xmath26 , @xmath27 and rearranging equation  [ eqn : gain ] , we obtain a condition for gains of greater than or approximately unity ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 this condition can also be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the degree of polarisation of the total background flux ( @xmath32 ) . in other words ,",
    "@xmath33 and the background flux must be high enough for a polariser to improve observing efficiency .",
    "for example , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the background flux must be greater than or approximately twice the object flux .",
    "normal polarising filters are notoriously lossy with typical transmissions of 0.70 ( one polarisation state ) .",
    "however , thin film polarisers made by ` bleaching ' can have transmissions as high as 0.96 ( gunning & foschaar 1983 ) . here",
    ", a polymerising sheet is placed in acetone to eat away most of the plastic .",
    "the polarising film is then stretched and deposited over a substrate in a humid oven .",
    "much of the art of bleaching resides in technical reports of the lockheed palar alto research laboratory where it was first developed by h.  e.  ramsey .",
    "when achieving the highest transmissions through bleaching , it is important that the extinction ratio be kept to about 10@xmath1 or lower .",
    "to consider the effect of observing objects during moonlit sky , we used the model of moonlight brightness described by krisciunas & schaefer ( 1991 ) . for various moon phases ( @xmath36 )",
    "is defined as the angular distance between the earth and the sun as seen from the moon .",
    "] , zenith angles and moon - object separation angles , we calculated the observing efficiency ( using equations  [ eqn : snr - no - pol ] and  [ eqn : snr - pol ] ) relative to dark - time observations at zenith .",
    "the extinction of object flux was considered in addition to the variation in background flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff - moon ] shows the results of these calculations for observations of @xmath37 mag  arcsec@xmath1  objects during phases from full moon to half moon .    during moonlit bright time ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "it is generally more efficient to observe _ with a polariser _ than without ( on appropriate targets , i.e. , background limited and near 90separation from the moon ) . remembering that poisson - noise gains of less than but near unity ( eqn .  [ eqn : gain ] ) can provide better observing efficiency if the duty cycle is significantly improved .",
    "additionally , residuals associated with continuum - sky subtraction may be reduced since the relative contribution of the moonlight ( solar spectrum ) to the overall flux is lower .    during moonlit grey time ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "it is generally best to observe without a polariser on targets that are about 40  to 90  away from the moon .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff - object ] shows the observing efficiency for various object brightnesses about one day away from full moon ( relative to dark - time observations of the same object brightness ) .",
    "there is some improvement when using a polariser for objects fainter than about 20 mag  arcsec@xmath1  at this moon phase .",
    "the brightness for which it is useful to use a polariser depends on the moonlight , the degree of polarisation , the dark - sky contribution , transmission and instrument efficiencies ( see equation  [ eqn : for - gain ] ) .",
    "= 14.0 cm    to consider observations during twilight , we produced a model of the twilight brightness based on the work by tyson & gal ( 1993 ) .",
    "the sky brightness versus the elevation angle of the sun is shown in figure  [ fig : degrees - bright ] . at sunset ,",
    "the brightness was assumed to be about 4.5 mag  arcsec@xmath1  decreasing towards the dark - sky brightness at the end of astronomical twilight , where we assumed that the twilight contribution was 0.1 times the dark - sky contribution .",
    "the flux for the minimum - intensity plane of polarisation , observing about 90  from the sun , is also shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : degrees - eff - obs ] shows the poisson - noise observing efficiencies for two different brightness objects during twilight .",
    "there is only a small range in elevation ( @xmath40 ) where the efficiency is above 0.2 with a polariser and where the gain is about or above unity ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gain ] ) . therefore , there is probably little use for this type of technique during twilight , with the possible exception of observing at high latitude sites , e.g. , on the antarctic continent where polarisers could allow observing in much brighter conditions which can last days or weeks .",
    "there , they could be used for site testing even if there are no specific science cases for twilight observing . by extension",
    ", a polariser could be used for daytime observations ( at any latitude ) such as astrometric star or planet measurements ( e.g. , rafferty & loader 1993 ) .",
    "for effective use of a polariser to minimise the sky background , it is necessary to be able to rotate the polariser or the instrument in a short time relative to exposure times .",
    "a minor adaption to instruments that are in operation or under design is required , including software to calculate the required rotation angle from the moon and object celestial coordinates . to check the validity of the setup",
    ", the sky flux can be measured at various rotation angles ( of the polariser or instrument ) in order to determine the angle that transmits the minimum sky flux .    for observatories that aim to optimise",
    "the use of bright - grey time for background limited observations , observing proposals and telescope schedules need to consider the moon s position .",
    "potentially , the most efficient use of bright - time observing with or without a polariser will be for those instruments where @xmath41 can be significantly greater than unity .",
    "equation  [ eqn : gain ] refers to the gain relative to the average of @xmath42 over instrument rotation angles .",
    "the ability to rotate the instrument independently of the polariser gives the option to maximise @xmath41 or , gains can be made without a polariser just by rotating the instrument so that the background flux is minimised .",
    "the factor @xmath41 could be measured for existing spectrographs , and in the future , spectrographs could be optimised for one polarisation state .    under design at",
    "the aao is a tunable lyot filter that is phase free over a wide field ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "the lyot filter requires a single polarisation input and therefore such an instrument has effectively @xmath43 at the appropriate polarisation angle , i.e. , a polariser is used in any case .",
    "such an instrument could be used during bright - grey time with instrument rotation used to minimise the sky background without loss of object flux .      to determine more accurately the gain in using a polariser , it is necessary for more measurements to be made .",
    "these include measurements of the polarisation of the moonlight contribution to the sky background , as a function of separation angle from the moon and as a function of wavelength .",
    "this is not straightforward because the moonlight contribution can not easily be distinguished from the dark - sky contribution .",
    "important questions to answer are : over what range of the sky is it useful to use a polariser , e.g. , 80  to 100  from the moon or only 85  to 95 ; for which broad - band filters is it useful , e.g. , @xmath44 or just @xmath45 ; in the @xmath46 bands , how is narrower - band imaging or spectroscopy between the oh emission lines affected ; how does the degree of polarisation vary with atmospheric conditions ?",
    "we suggest there is a key role to play for telescopes that do not have traditional bright - time instruments . near all - year - round dark - grey conditions can be obtained for survey work ( albeit sometimes at lower efficiency ) , by consideration of the moon s position and the use of a polariser during bright time . for any telescope",
    ", better use can be made of bright - grey conditions with or without a polariser .",
    "ikb would like to thank tim bedding and hans kjeldsen , and he hopes that this paper does not result in reduced observing time for stellar oscillation studies ."
