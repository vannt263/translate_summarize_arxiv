    "over the past few decades strongly interacting theories have continued to pose a considerable challenge for theoretical physicists . in recent years",
    "a thorough and comprehensive study of the phase diagram of non - supersymmetric gauge theories has been undertaken , for a review see @xcite . in brief , the renewed interest is due to the fact that a better knowledge of the nature of the conformal window can lead to the correct theory behind electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "these investigations can also be used for the construction of models of composite dark matter , reviewed in @xcite , and inflation @xcite .",
    "the first series of works were dedicated to the study of @xmath1 gauge theories with fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations of the gauge group @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was first realized that only two dirac fermions were needed in order to be near , or within , the conformal window .",
    "subsequently the study was generalized to non - supersymmetric @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge theories @xcite and to supersymmetric gauge theories with superfields belonging to arbitrary representations of the gauge group @xcite .",
    "the status for the conformal window of chiral gauge theories was summarized and further extended in @xcite . except for the supersymmetric case , and the case of the chiral gauge theories ,",
    "all the investigations were done primarily using the ladder approximation @xcite .    however , it was clear that one can not rely on just one crude approximation and new techniques had to be developed in order to obtain a firmer grip on the phase diagram . inspired by the work of seiberg @xcite in supersymmetric gauge theories and its use of the nsvz beta function @xcite to bound the conformal window an all - orders beta function for fermionic gauge theories",
    "was conjectured @xcite . using additional consistency checks",
    "it was found that the original beta function had to be slightly corrected in order to accommodate known analytical results @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the all - orders beta function is shape preserving when approaching the supersymmetric limit and that the beta function is written linearly in the anomalous dimension of the mass similarly to the supersymmetric case .",
    "also a related form of an all - orders beta function was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "one of the key outcomes using the all - orders beta function is its prediction of the anomalous dimension of the mass at a fixed point .",
    "in general it was found that the anomalous dimension was somewhat smaller than what was expected from the ladder approximation .",
    "therefore a third method using higher orders perturbation theory was utilized @xcite .",
    "both the beta function and the anomalous of the mass were computed to the fourth loop order in the @xmath4 scheme in @xcite which made it possible to investigate the corrections of higher loop orders in perturbation theory to the anomalous dimension at a fixed point . in general",
    "it was found that the anomalous dimension decreases when one includes higher orders signaling the accuracy and potential exactness of the all - orders beta function .",
    "the study of higher loop orders in supersymmetric theories has also been done to the three loop level in the @xmath5 scheme @xcite . here",
    "the same tendency as in the nonsupersymmetric case with a decreasing anomalous dimension at the fixed point is found .",
    "finally we note that also the conformal house of non - supersymmetric gauge theories with fermions transforming according to multiple representations of the gauge group has been of interest @xcite while the non - trivial consistency checks of the conformal window using dualities have been considered in @xcite .",
    "a quick search through the literature reveals that a considerable amount of the work done so far has been focused primarily on @xmath1 gauge theories with fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations while using a variety of different techniques .",
    "only a few scattered departures away from this direction of research has been carried out .",
    "this is certainly an incomplete survey of all possible non - supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "we therefore take the analysis one step further and exhaust the investigations by studying also theories with exceptional gauge groups and theories with fermions transforming according to spinorial representations .",
    "this is done using a number of different techniques that have all gained their respect in the case of an @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "they are    * the four loop beta function and anomalous dimension of the mass .",
    "* the all - orders beta function . * the ladder approximation .    in the past",
    "the use of the exceptional groups and the spinorial representations has found applications in many fields of particle physics including the famous examples of grand unified theories ( gut s ) and string theory .",
    "following the famous work on the @xmath6 gut @xcite where the sm fermions are assigned to the conjugate fundamental and the two - indexed antisymmetric representation other unifying gauge groups were proposed .",
    "specifically the orthogonal group @xmath7 was considered where a single generation of sm fermions filled out a complete @xmath8 dimensional spinorial representation @xcite . as opposed to the original @xmath6 theory the @xmath7 theory also allowed the inclusion of a right handed neutrino .",
    "similarly the exceptional group @xmath9 - which has @xmath7 as a subgroup - can be used as a unifying gauge group to which all the sm interactions and matter particles can be neatly incorporated @xcite . for an early review see @xcite .",
    "also in string theory the use of exceptional groups has found its way .",
    "consistency requires that one of the heterotic string theories has @xmath10 as gauge group @xcite .    from the discussion above it",
    "is clear that our analysis might not only provide useful insight into the construction of viable theories able to dynamically break the electroweak theory but it might also shed light on how an eventual grand unified theory should materialize , as well as dark matter and composite inflation",
    ".    furthermore lattice investigations of exceptional groups @xcite with the aim to elucidate the relation between chiral symmetry and confinement are already present in the literature granting further support to the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : methods ] we introduce the various methods and techniques used in our analysis . in section [ sec : exceptional ] and [ sec : spinorial ] we provide the results respectively for the exceptional groups and the spinorial representations .",
    "we start by giving a brief description of all the methods that we shall employ to estimate the critical number of flavors above which an ir fixed point is reached .",
    "we denote the generators in the representation @xmath11 of an arbitrary group by @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the dimension of the representation @xmath11 and the adjoint representation is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the generators are normalized according to @xmath15 =   t(r ) \\delta^{ab}$ ] while the quadratic casimir @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the trace normalization factor @xmath18 and the quadratic casimir are connected via @xmath19 .    consider a non - abelian gauge group and a set of fermions transforming according to a specific representation of the gauge group .",
    "the loss of asymptotic freedom is signaled by the change of sign in the first coefficient of the beta function .",
    "the number of flavors for which this occurs is @xmath20 just below this number of flavors the two loop beta function has an infrared fixed point away from the origin .",
    "this is the banks - zaks perturbative fixed point . as one decreases the number of flavors one expects the fixed point to disappear .",
    "we first extend the banks - zaks perturbative analysis to the maximum known order , to date , in perturbation theory .",
    "this will allow to extract relevant information on the perturbative infrared fixed point analysis for the theories investigated here .",
    "the beta function of a gauge theory with a set of fermions transforming according to an arbitrary representation of the gauge group has been computed to four loop order in the @xmath4 scheme @xcite .",
    "also the anomalous dimension of the mass is known to this order in the same scheme @xcite .",
    "they are given by @xmath21 - \\frac{d \\ln m } { d\\ln \\mu^2 } \\equiv \\frac{\\gamma(\\alpha)}{2 } & = & \\gamma_0   \\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi }   + \\gamma_1 \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi } \\right)^2 + \\gamma_2 \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi } \\right)^3 + \\gamma_3 \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi } \\right)^4 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the various coefficients are given in appendix [ app : coefficients ] and @xmath22 is the fermion mass .",
    "we use the beta function above to determine the location and type of zeros for the theories investigated here and determine for the infrared fixed point the associated anomalous dimension .",
    "we provide also the results for the lower boundary of the conformal window within the four - loop analysis with the caveat that , of course , higher orders as well as non - perturbative corrections are expected to contribute .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the four - loop analysis has been useful for the determination of the anomalous dimensions of @xmath1 gauge theories with fermions in various representations of the gauge group .",
    "in fact , recent first principle lattice simulations have provided results in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the results from this method will be shown together with the other methods in the next section .",
    "recently an all - orders beta function for nonsupersymmetric fermonic gauge theories has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is given in terms of the anomalous dimension and reads @xmath23 this beta function is written in terms of the first two universal coefficients as well as the first universal coefficient of the anomalous dimension .",
    "these are the only scheme independent quantities .",
    "@xmath24 is the number of flavors above which asymptotic freedom is lost . at the infrared zero of the beta function",
    "we have @xmath25 at the infrared fixed point the anomalous dimension is scheme independent and therefore this estimate can be used for any non - supersymmetric vector - like gauge theory with fermions in a given matter representation .      by studying a truncated version of the dyson - schwinger equation for the fermion propagator",
    "one obtains an estimate for the value of the coupling constant for which the formation of a chiral condensate is triggered and chiral symmetry breaks @xmath26 to determine when the theory looses conformality traditionally one compares the two - loop infrared fixed point value of @xmath27 with the estimate above .",
    "the two - loop value is : @xmath28 here the number of flavors is chosen such that the first coefficient of the beta function is larger than zero while the second coefficient is less than zero . equating the critical value of the coupling above with the value at the ir fixed point yields , what one believes to be ,",
    "the number of flavors marking the phase boundary of the conformal window @xmath29 in this approach , at this point the anomalous dimension of the mass is expected to be of the order unity .",
    "besides the classical lie groups there are are also five exceptional ones .",
    "these are denoted by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in table",
    "[ exceptional ] we summarize the various group invariants for the fundamental and adjoint representations .",
    "one should note that for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath9 and @xmath32 the fundamental and adjoint representation are distinct while for @xmath33 they coincide .",
    "the tensor @xmath34 , which appears at four loops , vanishes for all the exceptional groups , see appendix [ app : coefficients ]",
    ". therefore we do not need to compute the fourth order index @xmath35 .",
    "all we need is the trace normalization factors , @xmath18 , and the quadratic casimir , @xmath16 , for the fundamental and adjoint representations .",
    ".relevant group factors for the exceptional groups .",

    "this work completes the analytic investigation of the conformal window for any asymptotically free gauge group featuring fermionic matter .",
    "we discovered that every gauge group has a nontrivial phase diagram relevant when considering various extensions of the standard model .    to draw the phase diagrams we have used vastly different analytical approaches .",
    "remarkably we have found an extremely good agreement for the prediction of the lower boundary of the conformal window as well as the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass operator using these different methods .",
    "we can therefore argue for the presence of an underlying universal structure associated to the phase diagram of any non - supersymmetric gauge theory featuring fermionic matter .",
    "the universal structure embodies the existence of a conformal window for a finite number of flavors .",
    "the window , however , for the exceptional groups shrinks to a conformal line in the number of flavors .    what remains to be understood",
