    "it has long been realized that the presence of an appreciable concentration of free ions in a system of overall charge neutrality gives rise to a variety of thermodynamic features not found in un - ionized systems .",
    "for example , in the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , a system of charged hard - sphere anions and cations , all with equal charge magnitude @xmath3 and diameter @xmath4 , one has the famous limiting law established by the work of debye and hckel @xcite in 1923 , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the helmholtz free energy ( excess to the ideal - gas condition ) , @xmath7 is the system volume , @xmath8 boltzmann s constant , @xmath9 the temperature , @xmath10 the total number density of anions and cations , and @xmath11 is the inverse debye length , @xmath12 .",
    "this is in marked contrast to an un - ionized fluid , for which @xmath13 approaches a second virial - coefficient term proportional to @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 .",
    "results pertaining to phase transitions and criticality in the rpm did not emerge until much after the work of debye and hckel .",
    "it was not until 1976 that a systematic study by stell , wu , and larsen appeared with the conclusion that the rpm should exhibit a liquid - gas coexistence curve with a critical point @xcite .",
    "they further concluded that the critical density is much lower than for a simple argon - like fluid model , but found that that the shape and location of the coexistence curve was very sensitive to the details of the approximations that must inevitably be used in such a theoretical study .",
    "monte carlo simulations have yielded results fully consistent with their conclusions , but only in the last few years have the studies of different groups converged toward common values for the critical density and temperature of the rpm @xcite .    as one of us",
    "has discussed in earlier studies @xcite , the rpm can be thought of as a spin system with a long - ranged antiferromagnetic interaction    @xmath16    and one - dimensional spins @xmath17 with @xmath18 ;    @xmath19    ( since the  spins \" are charges , we should perhaps refer to the interaction as antiferroelectric rather than antiferromagnetic . )",
    "the lattice - gas version of such a spin fluid is simply the spin-1 ising model with @xmath20 , 0 , or -1 , with @xmath21 representing a vacant site",
    ". we shall refer to this model , which forms the subject of this report , as the _ lattice restricted primitive model _",
    "( lrpm ) .    for a lattice gas with a nearest - neighbor @xmath22 instead of a coulombic @xmath22 ,",
    "the spin-1 ising model is a blume - capel model @xcite , which becomes equivalent , at full occupancy , to a nearest - neighbor spin-@xmath23 ising model that is exactly - soluble on many two - dimensional lattices @xcite . on the square lattice",
    "one finds a nel point as one lowers the temperature in the absence of an external field .",
    "moreover , although exact results are lacking in three dimensions , one expects for bipartite lattices such as the simple cubic , that as one lowers the density along the @xmath24-line of nel points in the @xmath10-@xmath9 plane , one encounters a tricritical point below which the lattice gas phase - separates into paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "this immediately raises the question whether this remains true for a lattice gas with a coulombic @xmath22 .",
    "several years ago , in order to better understand the lrpm , we initiated monte carlo simulations on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "our results are fully consistent with the presence of a @xmath24-line of nel points terminating in a tricritical point , below which ( in @xmath9 ) two phases coexist .",
    "preliminary results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we provide more extensive results as well as details of our simulation procedure .",
    "we have supplemented our simulations with a mean - field analysis that exploits the similarity between the lrpm and a nearest - neighbor lattice gas . h@xmath25ye and stell @xcite have also made a more general study of the spin-1 ising model that included the solution of the mean - spherical approximation ( msa ) for a range - parametrized @xmath22 .",
    "as discussed by these authors , the msa is not appropriate to study criticality and phase separation in the spin-1 model with coulombic @xmath22 ( although , as they show , it does yield the correct debye - hckel limiting law ) .",
    "the h@xmath25ye - stell study , however , goes beyond the msa with a number of general observations that strongly support tricriticality for a coulombic @xmath22 .",
    "more recent studies made by ciach and stell @xcite of ionic models that include the continuum - space and lattice rpm reveal that generically such models can be expected to manifest criticality , tricriticality , or both , depending upon the precise forn of their hamiltonians . for example",
    ", the work suggests that some extended - core lattice models may well show both liquid - gas like criticality and , at higher densities , a @xmath24-line with associated tricriticality . for the rpm ,",
    "the critical properties that follow from application of rg analysis are found to be in the ising universality class .",
    "we consider a lattice gas of particles interacting via site exclusion ( multiple occupancy forbidden ) and a coulomb interaction @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance separating the particles ( located at lattice sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 or @xmath31 is the charge of particle @xmath32 .",
    "exactly half the @xmath33 particles are positively charged ; the remainder are negative .",
    "they are restricted to a simple cubic lattice of @xmath34 sites , with periodic boundaries .",
    "we assume a lattice constant @xmath35 of unity , and adopt units in which @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the magnitude of the charge . in what follows",
    "we treat charge , length , energy and temperature as dimensionless .",
    "we note in passing that in lattice simulations of ionic systems an alternative definition of the potential is possible , i.e. , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the green s function for poisson s equation on the lattice in question . while the simple @xmath0 potential and the lattice green s function differ somewhat at short distances , they have the same asymptotic ( large @xmath40 ) behavior , and we expect ( qualitatively ) the same phase diagram in either case .    in this study",
    "we restrict attention to the simple cubic lattice .",
    "this lattice , like the body - centered cubic , admits a decomposition into two sublattices ( the sites on one sublattice having all nearest neighbors in the other sublattice ) , which obviously facilitates formation of an ordered state resembling an ionic crystal .",
    "indeed , it was proven some time ago that the lrpm on the simple cubic lattice exhibits long - range order at sufficiently low temperatures and high fugacities @xcite . the model presents , as we will show , a strong tendency to assume a nacl - like ordered state at low temperatures .",
    "it would be interesting to study the model on the face - centered cubic lattice or another structure that frustrates antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the energy of the lattice restricted primitive model is    @xmath41    where it is understood that the particles occupy distinct lattice sites .",
    "we consider the lrpm with independent variables @xmath9 ( temperature ) and @xmath42 .",
    "it is helpful to think of this system as a three - state ( i.e. , spin-1 ) antiferromagnetic ising model with long - range interactions ( @xmath43 ) . on a fully occupied lattice ( @xmath44 )",
    "we characterize ordering by the sublattice charge disparity or staggered magnetization @xmath45 . in the context of mft , this allows us to replace eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) by the corresponding expression for a _ nearest - neighbor _ ( nn ) lattice gas , multiplied by a suitable factor .",
    "consider first the disordered system .",
    "since the neighbors of any given particle are equally likely to bear the same or opposite charges , the mean - field estimate for the energy is zero , just as for the nn system .",
    "next , suppose there is sublattice ordering ; let @xmath46 be the fraction of sites in sublattice @xmath47 occupied by positive particles , etc . , and let    @xmath48    @xmath49    so that    @xmath50    and @xmath51    using these , the mean - field estimate for the energy of a pair of nearest - neighbor sites is @xmath52 similarly , the mf estimate for the energy of a pair of second - neighbor sites ( which must belong to the same sublattice ) is @xmath53 , and so on .",
    "thus mft gives the energy of the lrpm as @xmath54 where @xmath55 if sites @xmath32 and @xmath56 belong to the same ( different ) sublattices .",
    "the sum ( including the factor of 1/2 ) is simply the electrostatic energy of an ionic crystal . for the simple cubic lattice ,    @xmath57    as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the madelung constant @xcite .",
    "thus the mean - field energy per site is @xmath60 , while the corresponding expression for a system with nearest - neighbor interactions is @xmath61 . in the context of mft ,",
    "then , we may replace the @xmath0 potential with a nearest - neighbor interaction .    from the preceding analysis it appears that we may treat the lrpm , in mft , as if it were a nearest - neighbor lattice gas , but with an energy ( and temperature ) scale that is smaller by a factor of @xmath62 . a more meaningful way of relating the temperature scales , however , is to compare the energy change attending an elementary excitation , in this case , the interchange of a nearest - neighbor pair in a perfectly ordered lattice . in the simple cubic lattice",
    "this raises the energy by @xmath63 ( the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath64 ) , since ten nearest - neighbor pairs have like charges after the exchange . for the ionic crystal ( nacl structure )",
    "the corresponding energy change is @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 .",
    "since the mean - field critical temperature for the ( fully occupied ) nearest - neighbor lattice gas is 6 on the cubic lattice , the corresponding result for the lrpm is about 0.9 .",
    "the best numerical estimate for the lattice gas is @xmath67 ; the corresponding lrpm value is 0.674 .",
    "( extrapolation of our simulation results to @xmath44 yields @xmath68 . )",
    "we may now develop the mft of the lrpm by studying the nearest - neighbor lattice gas , bearing in mind the difference in temperature scales explained above . to estimate the entropy as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath45 , we note that the number of allowed configurations on a sublattice of @xmath69 sites is @xmath70 $ ] where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is the number of positive ( negative ) particles and @xmath73 $ ] the number of vacant sites on the sublattice . using @xmath74 , etc . , and",

    "next we investigate the stability of the uniform - density state .",
    "defining @xmath86 as the free energy per particle , we may write the chemical potential as @xmath87 where the pressure @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 ( in evaluating the derivative we use eq .",
    "( [ min ] ) to eliminate @xmath90 . )",

    "this subsection presents the multipole expansion as an efficient alternative to ewald summation for evaluating the electrostatic energy of a periodic array of point charges .",
    "our approach is closely related to the one employed by ladd in simulations of ionic and dipolar fluids @xcite .",

    "many terms vanish by symmetry .",

    "the table entry includes the direct ( minimum - image ) contribution , the lattice - sum contribution obtained via multipole expansion , and a dipolar contribution to be explained in the following subsection .      in this very brief subsection",
    "we call attention to an absolutely crucial point in the simulation of systems ( on or off - lattice ) with slowly decaying forces .",
    "it is that the energy of the fully periodic array _ differs from _ the infinite lattice sum ( taken , e.g. , in spherical order , as above ) , by a term proportional to the square of the cell dipole moment : @xmath192         + \\frac{2 \\pi}{3l^3 } m^2 \\label{dip1}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 is the dipole moment of ( any ) cell .",
    "this result was derived and discussed in detail by de leeuw , perram , and smith in 1980 @xcite .",

    "we therefore add the term @xmath195 to the contribution of charges @xmath32 and @xmath56 to the potential energy .",
    "some preliminary studies , which did not include this dipole term , yielded bizarre results , such as the tendency for a system with @xmath196 to crystallize into a uniform - density body - centered cubic structure at low temperatures .",
    "the majority of the data reported here were obtained in canonical ensemble simulations following the usual metropolis prescription , i.e. , trial configurations that lower the energy are accepted with probability 1 , while those attended by an energy increase @xmath197 are accepted with probability @xmath198 .",
    "an initial configuration is generated by placing @xmath33 particles onto the lattice at random , with double occupancy forbidden .",
    "this naturally yields a rather high - energy configuration that must be allowed to relax before the system attains equilibrium .",
    "we generally used a configuration relaxed at some temperature @xmath9 as the initial configuration for a study at a nearby temperature @xmath199 .",
    "the energy and order parameter ( defined below ) were monitored in order to check for relaxation .",
    "trial configurations are generated by two kinds of  moves . \"",
    "the first is a single - particle move : a particle , chosen at random , is displaced by @xmath200 , where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are independent , integer - valued random variables distributed uniformly on the set @xmath201 .",
    "( we generally used @xmath202 . )",
    "if the trial site is occupied , the move is rejected ; otherwise the energy change is evaluated and the move accepted according to the metropolis scheme . at low temperatures , each particle typically has one or more neighbors of the opposite charge ; single - particle moves , which tend to disrupt these dipolar pairs , will have a low acceptance rate .",
    "we therefore alternated single - particle moves with pair moves . in this case",
    "we select a particle @xmath32 at random , and check if one of the nearest - neighbor sites ( also selected at random ) harbors a particle .",
    "( call it @xmath56 ; if the site is vacant the trial ends . )",
    "given an occupied neighbor , particle @xmath32 is displaced by @xmath203*r * as above , and particle @xmath56 is placed at a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor site of particle @xmath32 .",
    "( naturally , both trial sites must be vacant for the move to occur . )",
    "the move is accepted or rejected , as before , based on the metropolis criterion .",
    "the results reported here represent averages over ( typically ) 2 to 10 of runs , each consisting of on the order of @xmath204 lattice updates ( i.e. , moves per particle ) .",
    "a run of this sort requires 1 - 2 days of cpu time on a fast dec alpha machine .",
    "in addition to the energy and the specific heat ( obtained from the variance of the energy ) , we monitored the charge charge - charge correlation function , @xmath205 and the density - density correlation function , @xmath206    here @xmath207 = 1 ( -1 ) if site * x * is occupied by a positively ( negatively ) charged particle , and is zero otherwise . the normalization @xmath208 is chosen such that @xmath209 for @xmath210 .",

    "further support is provided by the comparison between two system sizes ( for the same density , @xmath244 ) shown in figure [ dic7 ] : the larger system presents a sharper variation in @xmath241 in the vicinty of the apparent transition .",
    "the high-@xmath9 specific heat peak , barely visible in the @xmath235 data , is quite prominent for @xmath245 ; both peaks shift to slightly higher temperatures for @xmath245 .",
    "all of this is consistent with the system exhibiting phase transitions at @xmath236 and @xmath242 .",
    "we shall therefore refer to the set of transitions commencing around @xmath244 as the nel line .",
    "further insight into the phase transition at or near the high-@xmath9 specific heat peak is afforded by the charge - charge correlation function @xmath246 .",
    "figure [ dic8 ] shows @xmath246 for three temperatures in the neighborhood of @xmath242 , for @xmath247 . in all of the cases shown ,",
    "@xmath248 exhibits damped oscillations . at the highest temperature ( @xmath249 ) the oscillations evidently decay to zero ; for @xmath250 the decay appears to be slower , while for @xmath251 they seem to persist . a plot of @xmath252 versus @xmath0 ( figure [ dic9 ] ) yields a clearer idea of the large-@xmath40 behavior ; from this graph it is evident that @xmath248 decays to zero for @xmath253 but not for @xmath251 .",
    "( the specific heat peaks at @xmath254 . )",
    "thus the condition @xmath255 is a criterion for the ordered phase , and the limiting value of @xmath252 provides , in principle , an alternative definition of the order parameter . in practice , we are able to obtain @xmath45 with greater precision ( smaller statistical uncertainty ) , and so retain it as a measure of global order .",
    "it is worth noting that in the neighborhood of the lambda line , the density - density correlation function @xmath256 shows little structure : it has a low - amplitude peak at unit distance and then decays rapidly to its asymptotic value ( see figure [ dic10 ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the line of low - temperature specific heat peaks .",
    "the mean - field theory results described above lead us to interpret this as a coexistence curve , so that @xmath257 marks a transition from a homogeneous system to coexisting high- and low - density phases , the former disordered , the latter with sublattice ordering . to better understand",
    "what is happening at @xmath236 , we examine the occupancy histograms .",
    "some typical results for @xmath247 are shown in figure [ dic11 ] .",
    "for @xmath258 the distribution is unimodal , and peaked near @xmath259 . as the temperature is lowered , the distribution broadens and the peak moves to @xmath44 and increases in amplitude , signaling the emergence of a high - density phase .",
    "for @xmath260 a plateau has appeared for @xmath261 , while for @xmath262 the distribution is bimodal .",
    "( note also the odd - even oscillations in @xmath263 , especially prominent for @xmath264 .",
    "these presumably represent a tendency to local charge neutrality . )",
    "all through the transition region , the order parameter @xmath45 is very nearly unity ; for this density , the transition near @xmath236 is not associated with the onset of sublattice order .",
    "( such order is already present in the uniform phase for @xmath265 . )",
    "figure [ dic12 ] shows a series of occupancy histograms for a much lower density , @xmath266 . at the highest temperature shown , @xmath258",
    ", the distribution peaks in the vicinity of @xmath267 and decays rapidly for higher densities .",
    "for @xmath268 the distribution is already considerably broader , and by @xmath269 a plateau near @xmath44 has appeared . at @xmath270",
    "the distribution has become very broad , the main peak has shifted toward @xmath271 , and a secondary peak has appeared at @xmath44 , indicating separation into high- and low - density phases . by @xmath272 the transformation is complete : the histogram peaks at @xmath271 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to observe the changes in the density - density correlation function @xmath273 , in the neighborhood of the transition . in figure [ dic13 ]",
    "we see that @xmath274 decays rapidly for @xmath258 ( the correlation length @xmath275 ) , and is somewhat longer - ranged ( @xmath276 ) for @xmath268 . for @xmath260",
    "the decay is much slower ( @xmath277 ) . at temperatures below @xmath278 ,",
    "the system has phase - separated and we are no longer able to infer the large-@xmath40 limiting value of @xmath279 .",
    "the histogram and correlation function data suggest that for @xmath266 , phase separation occurs at @xmath280 , in agreement with transition temperature of 0.108 indicated by the specific heat maximum .",
    "in contrast to what is seen at higher densities , for @xmath266 the transition at @xmath236 is accompanied by the onset of sublattice order : @xmath241 is small for @xmath281 and grows rapidly in the range @xmath270  0.115 .",
    "this is just what one would expect , since the transition in this case marks the appearance of a high - density phase , capable of supporting nacl - like order .",
    "( sublattice ordering is associated with the transition at @xmath236 for @xmath282 . )",
    "figure [ dic14 ] is a snapshot of a typical configuration of the phase - separated system , in which we see a dense , crystal - like agglomerate coexisting with a dilute vapor , comprised largely of dipolar associations .    using the specific heat data , together with results for the order parameter and the charge - charge correlation function , we have derived a series of estimates for points along the lambda line , @xmath283 , for @xmath284  0.85 .",
    "the scatter amongst the values suggested by the specific heat , order parameter , and correlation function data yields an uncertainty estimate for @xmath283 .",
    "similarly , we use the specific heat , cell occupancy histogram , and density - density correlation function data to estimate the phase - separation temperature @xmath257 .    in an effort",
    "to determine the coexisting densities with greater precision , we also performed grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) simulations .",
    "figure [ dic15 ] shows the dependence of the density on the pair activity @xmath24 . for @xmath285 the dependence is smooth , but for @xmath286 there is a discontinuity at @xmath287 .",
    "hysteresis effects are minimal for @xmath281 , and the coexisting densities are given by the limiting values as we approach @xmath288 from above and below .",
    "the gce studies furnish an independent prediction for the coexistence curve in the range @xmath289  0.14 .    in figure [ dic16 ]",
    "we plot our best estimates for @xmath242 ( from canonical simulations ) , and for the coexistence curve , from both the canonical and gce studies .",
    "evidently , the coexistence curve is shifted upward in the gce simulations , whose results place the tricritical point ( i.e. , the intersection of the lambda line and the coexistence curve ) , at around @xmath290 , as opposed to about @xmath268 in the canonical studies . since the two ensembles are not required to give identical results for finite systems , there is no inconsistency implied .",
    "the grand canonical results , however , seem preferable on several grounds .",
    "first , the shape of the coexistence curve looks more reasonable ( more like the familiar ising / lattice gas coexistence curve ) .",
    "more significantly , perhaps , the gce curve actually meets the lambda line , which appears to veer horizontally near @xmath244 , and shows no sign of ever encountering the canonical coexistence curve .",
    "given the large surface effects implicit in phase coexistence in a small system , the gce , which studies homogeneous phases , seems more likely to give reliable results in a finite size simulation .",
    "one may speculate that the large surface energy depresses the transition temperature in the canonical ensemble simulations .",
    "a more definitive answer to this question must await the results of larger scale simulations .",
    "we have determined the phase diagram of the lattice restricted primitive model in extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "our simulations reproduce the principal features expected on the basis of general arguments and mean - field theory , that is , a @xmath24-line of nel points meeting a coexistence curve at a tricritcal point .",
    "our best estimate for the location of the tricritical point is @xmath1 , @xmath2 , while mean - field theory predicts @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "this comparison is consistent with the tendency of mean - field theories to overestimate transition temperatures , and underestimate transition densities ( i.e. , to overestimate the stability of ordered phases ) .    during the completion of this work we learned of panagiotopoulos and kumar s simulation results for the lrpm @xcite , which include a study of the effects of varying the size of the hard core .",
    "their results for the case of site - exclusion studied here support our conclusions for the phase diagram , with the exception that the tricritical density is somewhat larger ( @xmath293 in their work ) and the nel line appears to be nearly vertical in the vicinity of the tricritical point .    because our results come almost entirely from studies of a single system size ( @xmath235 ) , it is difficult to assign meaningful uncertainties to @xmath294 , @xmath295 , or , indeed , the location of the @xmath24-line in the @xmath10-@xmath9 plane .",
    "the limited comparison we made with a system of size @xmath245 ( figure [ dic7 ] ) suggests that the true transition temperature ( for the @xmath24-transition ) may be 510% higher than that observed for @xmath235 .",
    "we have also noted a sizeable discrepancy ( @xmath296% ) between canonical and grand canonical simulations regarding the position of the coexistence curve along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "studying larger systems is therefore the first order of business for future simulations of the lrpm .",
    "since simulations are quite slow , with many trial moves rejected at the low temperatures of interest , even for the relatively small systems studied here , we anticipate the need for non - metropolis simulation methods utilizing histograms , multi - canonical sampling , and/or cluster dynamics to augment efficiency .",
    "if such methods can be developed , a number of issues can be explored .",
    "it is of interest to understand the nature of the transitions occuring along the @xmath24-line and at the tricritical point , to assign these their proper universality classes .",
    "we may also anticipate that the interface between the dense and dilute phases undergoes a roughening transition at a certain temperature .",
    "another topic worthy of investigation is the global phase diagram as one goes from the coulombic system studied here to a lattice gas with nearest - neighbor interactions , via a family of models described by a potential ( e.g. , of yukawa form ) having a range parameter .",
    "the lrpm with a lattice green s function interaction , and on lattices that do not support antiferromagnetic order , are , as noted above , further topics for future work .",

    "[ dip1 ] , which proved invaluable for simulating the model properly .",
