    "an important topic of interest , in modeling of saturated flow through porous media , is the analysis of the phenomenon when there is a microstructure present in the rock matrix .",
    "some of the achievements in the preexisting literature address the case when the microstructure is periodic ; see @xcite for the analytical approach and @xcite for the numerical point of view . from a different perspective , in @xcite is presented the homogenization analysis for a non - periodic fissured system where the geometry of the cracks surface satisfies @xmath0-smoothness hypotheses .",
    "however , none of these mathematical analysis accomplishments , takes in consideration a fractal geometric structure of porous media , which is an important case due to the remarkable evidence of this fact ; in particular in @xcite the authors found that pore space and pore interface have fractal features .",
    "also , see @xcite for pore structure characterization , including random growth models .",
    "see @xcite for fractal geometry results in tracing experiments within a porous medium including dispersion , fingering and percolation .",
    "finally , @xcite discusses the use of fractal surfaces in modeling the storage phenomenon in gas reservoirs .",
    "this paper concentrates on finding adequate fluid transmission conditions for flow in porous media with fractal interface , as well as the well - posedness of the corresponding weak variational formulations .",
    "our goal is to  blend \" the modeling of porous media flow with the fractal roughness of the microstructure .",
    "we differ from the previously mentioned achievements since we replace the geometric feature of periodicity by that of self - similarity and explore , numerically , the effect of some randomness in the fractal geometry . on the other hand , the present study has a very different approach to the analysis on fractals from the preexisting literature , given that the mainstream pde analysis on fractals concentrates its efforts in solving strong forms on the fractal domain @xcite , the analysis of the associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions @xcite , or the study of the adequate function spaces @xcite .    in order to start understanding the key features of the phenomenon , we limit the study to the 1-d setting , defining the domain of analysis as @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , we will use and adjustment of the classic stationary diffusion problem below , in order to introduce the fluid exchange transmission conditions across the fractal interface @xmath2 here @xmath3 stands for the pressure , @xmath4 indicates the flux according to darcy s law and @xmath5 denotes de permeability , which will be set as @xmath6 throughout this work .",
    "in addition , we set dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the extremes of the interval .",
    "we use classical notation and results on function spaces @xmath7 and indicate with standard letters @xmath8 the functions on these spaces .",
    "we adopt the letters @xmath9 , @xmath10 to denote the microstructure and its elements respectively , in particular , the following classical hilbert space will be frequently used    [ eqn hilbert space on fractal ] @xmath11 endowed with its natural inner product @xmath12    in the next section , we introduce the geometry of the fractal interface , together with the adequate mathematical setting in order to include it successfully in the pde model .      throughout this work we limit to a particular type of fractal microstructure ,",
    "first we need to introduce a previous definition and a related result ( see @xcite )    let @xmath13 be a closed set    a.   a function @xmath14 is said to be a * contraction * if there exists a constant @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",

    "b.   additional experiments for the random behavior _ example _",
    "[ ex random behavior example ] were executed .",
    "the probabilistic variations involved were a.   experiments for the stages @xmath273 and @xmath274 . b.   experiments with different number of realizations , namely @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 , depending on the computational time demanded .",
    "c.   using a storage coefficient @xmath278 , with @xmath279 different intervals and @xmath176 with uniform distribution normal distribution .",

    "+ in all the cases , convergence behavior was observed as expected . naturally , the quality of convergence deteriorates depending on the deviation of the distributions and the combination of uncertainty factors introduced in the experiment . c.   all the previously mentioned scenarios were also executed in the same code for the case of homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends i.e. , @xmath280 .",
    "as expected convergence behavior is observed which is comparable with the corresponding analogous version setting the boundary conditions @xmath281 , @xmath282 , used along the analysis of this paper .",
    "the present work yields several accomplishments as well as limitations listed below .",
    "a.   the unscaled storage model presented in _ section _",
    "[ sec a sigma finite interface microstructure ] is in general not adequate , as it excludes most of the important cases of fractals .",
    "b.   the scaled storage model presented in _ section _",
    "[ dec fractal scaling modeling ] is suitable for an important number of fractal microstructures .",
    "however , the asymptotic variational model is equivalent to a pointwise strong model only if the closure of the microstructure @xmath283 is negligible i.e. , if it has null lebesgue measure .",
    "such hypothesis excludes important cases e.g. the family of  fat \" cantor sets , see @xcite in 1-d or the  fat \" versions of the classic fractal structures in 2-d or 3-d , where only the  averaged normal flux \" _ statement _ can be concluded for the accumulation points of the microstructure @xmath223 . c.   in order to overcome",
    "the deficiency previously mentioned a first approach would be to take the traditional treatment of solving strong forms in fractal domains ( e.g. @xcite ) and then try to  blend \" it with the point of view presented here .",
    "such analysis is to be pursued in future research .",
    "d.   the fractal microstructures addressed in this work are self - similar .",
    "this requirement is important only for the second model ( _ section _ [ dec fractal scaling modeling ] ) because it scales the storage according to the geometric detail of the structure at every level . in particular , we need an accurate idea of the growth rate of the microstructure @xmath9 from one level to the next , in order to scale the storage adequately .",
    "e.   the self - similarity requirement for the microstructure @xmath9 in the introduction of the scaled model excludes the important family of the self - affine fractals ; this type of microstructures is a topic for future work . on the other hand , the unscaled model of _ section _ [",
    "sec a sigma finite interface microstructure ] does not require such detailed knowledge of the microstructure precisely because it avoids scaling , although it is likely to be unsuited for the analysis of self - affine microstructures it may be a good starting point in order to detect the needs of the modeling for this case .",
    "f.   it is important to observe the relevance of self - similarity versus the fractal dimension in the scaled model .",
    "while the self - similarity of the microstructure is the corner stone of the scaling ( hence it can not be given up ) the model is more flexible with respect to the fractal dimension of @xmath9 as long as it is not the same of the  host \" domain @xmath284 .",
    "g.   we also stress that the input needed by the present result , in terms of geometric information on the fractal structure , does not have to be as detailed as in the strong forms pde analysis on fractals . h.   the random experiments presented in _ example _ [ ex random behavior example ] , as well as those only mentioned in _ subsection _ [ sec closing observations numerical ] , furnish solid numerical evidence of good behavior for probabilistic versions of the unscaled and the scaled models respectively .",
    "additionally , it is important to handle certain level of uncertainty because , assuming to have a deterministic description of the fractal microstructure is a too strong hypothesis to be applicable in realistic scenarios . in the authors opinion ,",
    "this is justification enough to pursue rigorous analysis of these problems to be addressed in future work .",
    "i.   in _ example _ [ ex random behavior example ] uncertainty was introduced in the storage coefficient @xmath176 , or the forcing term @xmath53 , however the geometry of the microstructure was never randomized . in several works ( e.g. @xcite ) the self - similarity is replaced by the concept of statistical self - similarity in the sense that scaling of small parts have the same statistical distribution as the whole set .",
    "clearly , this random property is consistent with the scaling of @xmath176 in _ definition _ [ def scaled storage coefficient ] ; consequently , the statistical self - similarity is a future line of research for handling geometric uncertainty of the fractal microstructure @xmath9 . in particular , the fractal percolation microstructures ,",
    "are of special interest for real world applications , see @xcite .",
    "j.   the execution of all the numerical experiments shows that the code becomes unstable beyond the 9th stage of the cantor set construction .",
    "this suggests that in order to overcome these issues , an adaptation of the fem method has to be developed , targeted to the microstructure of interest .",
    "this aspect is to be analyzed in future research .",
    "k.   the study of fractal microstructures in 2-d and 3-d are necessary for practical applications and in higher dimensions for theoretical purposes . given that passing from one dimension to two or more dimensions increases significantly the level of complexity in the microstructure and in the equation , considerable challenges are to be expected in this future line of research .",
    "l.   another important analysis to be developed is the study of the models both , scaled and unscaled , in the mixed - mixed variational formulation introduced in @xcite . on one hand , this approach allows great flexibility for the underlying spaces of velocity and pressure which can constitute an advantage with respect to the treatment presented here . on the other hand , the mixed - mixed variational formulation allows modeling fluid exchange conditions across the interface of greater generality than , used in the present work ; this fact can contribute significantly to the development of the field .",
