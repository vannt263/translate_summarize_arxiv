    "in this paper we will pursue some technical details concerning the computation and the physical understanding of the recent analysis by stupakov @xcite on the effect of coulomb diffusion on bunching coefficients in echo enabled harmonic generation ( eehg ) free electron laser ( fel ) seeded devices @xcite .",
    "the considerations developed in this paper should be understood as a complement to refs .",
    "@xcite , with the aim of providing a more general computational framework , benefitting from the formalism of beam transport employing algebraic means @xcite . in this treatment",
    "the transport through magnetic elements is treated in terms of exponential operator acting on an initial phase space distribution and usually do not contain  transport elements provided by a heat type diffusion . here",
    "we will show that diffusion mechanisms can be included in such a framework in a fairly straightforward way @xcite , preserving the spirit of exponential operator concatenation .",
    "the effect of the coulomb diffusion on the e - beam longitudinal phase space distribution is ruled , according to @xcite , by the equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the coordinate of propagation , @xmath2 is the longitudinal coordinate in the beam , @xmath3 is associated to the beam energy , @xmath4 is the coulomb diffusion coefficient and @xmath5 is the  initial distribution .",
    "we will discuss the physical meaning of the previous quantities and we will provide their explicit expression in the following , for the moment we note that , having assumed that @xmath4 is independent of @xmath3 , we can solve via the following gauss - weierstrass ( g - w ) transform @xcite    @xmath6    the bunching coefficients can be defined as those of the fourier components of the expansion @xcite    @xmath7    and are , therefore , specified by @xmath8 the dilution of the bunching coefficients induced by the coulomb diffusion can therefore be mathematically expressed as    @xmath9    following ref .",

    "the solution of eq . can be therefore easily computed , even though can not be obtained in analytical form . in fig .",
    "1 we have reported the effect of the dispersion on the initial distribution ( fig .",

    "a ) @xmath14 b ) @xmath15.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is evident that the coulomb term smears out the oscillations , associated with the bunching coefficients , which tend to disappear or to be strongly suppressed , as we will further discuss in the following .",
    "if we neglect in eq .",
    "the contributions @xmath16 we can expand @xmath17 in series of bessel functions , namely    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are cylindrical bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "the associated bunching coefficients are , neglecting contributions in @xmath20 , provided by @xmath21 the g - w transform can be accordingly written as ( see appendix ) @xmath22 and bunching coefficients now read    @xmath23    @xmath24    the effect of the coulombian diffusion is therefore twofold , it induces    \\a ) a dispersion due to the term @xmath25",
    "\\b ) a suppression of the higher orders harmonics occurring through @xmath26 .    in these introductory remarks",
    "we have provided a few remarks on the type of formalism we are going to use to treat the bunching mechanism in eehg fel seeded devices , the forthcoming sections will cover more physical details .",
    "we have quoted the initial distribution given in eq . without any comment about its physical meaning .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the following liouville equation @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    which rules the evolution of an ensemble of non - interacting particles , driven by the hamiltonian @xmath30 the solution of eq . can be cast in the form @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    we have denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the evolution and liouville operators , respectively , of our dynamical problem @xcite .",
    "we note that the liouville operator breaks into two non - commuting parts , therefore any treatment of the associated evolution operator demands for an approximate disentanglement of the exponential , which , for simplicity will be assumed to be provided by @xcite @xmath35 which is accurate to @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the use of the rule @xmath37 allows to cast the solution of eq . in the form",
    "@xmath38 therefore by setting @xmath39 and keep as initial distribution a gaussian in @xmath3 , we recover eq . .    the physical scheme",
    ", we are dealing with , is reported in ref .",

    "the e - beam undergoes two successive modulations induced by two different lasers in two different sections .",
    "the beam initial distribution is that occurring after the first chicane at the entrance of the second modulator .",
    "the physical content of the previous variables is the following    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the e - beam energy spread , @xmath43 is the induced energy modulation , @xmath44 is the laser wave vector .",
    "the dynamics of the bunching coefficients can be obtained from eqs . and as ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46.\\label{ziter}\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath47    eq . yields an idea of the coupling between the various bunching coefficients and has already been derived in a closely similar fom in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb diffusion in this scheme can be modeled by transforming the liouville into a vlasov equation , namely    @xmath48    the diffusion coefficient , expressed in practical units , reads @xcite @xmath49}{\\varepsilon_{x}\\left[\\mu m\\right]\\sigma_{x}\\left[100\\mu m\\right]\\left(\\sigma_{e}\\left[kev\\right]\\right)^{2}}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the emittance and beam section respectively    the solution of eq .",
    "can be obtained as    @xmath52    according to this approximation the effect of the diffusion is calculated separately from that induced by the liouvillian contribution .",
    "higher order disentanglements @xcite can be used to get more accurate results , but the present approximation is adequate for our purposes .    in fig .",
    "2 we report the contour plots of the liouville distribution with and without the effect of the coulombian diffusion for the same s value . it is evident that the presence of a non - zero @xmath4 value provides a significant reduction of the distribution harmonic content . a global view is provided by fig .",

    "in the introductory section we have expanded the initial distribution , by neglecting the contributions in @xmath56 .",
    "such an approximation implies that the induced energy modulation is not large compared to the natural e - beam energy spread .",
    "however if we relax these assumptions and employ the formalism of generalized bessel functions @xcite , we can obtain a more general view on the problem under study .",
    "it has indeed been shown that two variable bessel functions can be expressed through the generating function @xmath57        where @xmath60 are two variable hermite - kamp d frit polynomials @xcite .",
    "they are actually understood as belonging to the family of hermite based functions and are widely exploited to deal with radiation scattering problems @xcite , going beyond the dipole approximation .                  which holds if the laser , in the second modulator , is the same of the first .",
    "we have removed the @xmath1 variable because absorbed into the @xmath67 and @xmath68 terms .",
    "if we use the bessel function expansion @xmath69 we can therefore cast the distribution at the end of the second modulator as @xmath70            the effect of the coulombian diffusion on the distribution can be easily computed , either numerically or analytically . by keeping the lowest order contribution @xmath74 and by approximating the bessel function as      from the above equation we easily deduce that the coulombian contribution yields a suppression factor proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "more in general as also pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite the larger is the order of bunching the more significant is the effect of the reduction .",
    "the formalism we have presented in this paper provides a fairly detailed analysis of how the coulombian diffusion affect the bunching coefficients in echo enabled fel devices .",
    "our treatment is complementary to the seminal contributions of refs .",
    "@xcite and confirm , within a more general framework , their conclusions .",
    "we believe that the modularity of the methods we have described in this paper offer further opportunities as e. g. that of including in the treatment more complicated arrangements of transport lines and of external fields .",
    "the possibility of embedding these procedures with diffusion and damping in storage rings , will be discussed elsewhere ."
