    "the description of the nuclear many - body problem in terms of strongly interacting quarks and gluons is one of the major challenges in nuclear physics . at present",
    ", however , rigorous studies of qcd are restricted to matter systems at high temperature and zero baryon density .",
    "because of the nonperturbative features , it appears very difficult to derive from this theory predictions for processes at energy scales relevant for low- and medium - energy nuclear phenomenology .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that despite these difficulties nuclear phenomenology can be efficiently described using hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "while this framework has been very successful in describing the features of nuclear matter and the binding energy systematics of finite nuclei , experiments , such as deep inelastic scattering off nucleons , provide evidence that the standard hadronic picture has to be corrected .",
    "for example , the prominent emc effect which reveals medium modifications of the internal structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "moreover , hadronic models are often extrapolated into regimes of high density and temperature to extract the nuclear equation of state , which is the basic ingredient in many astrophysical applications and in microscopic models of energetic nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "one can expect that under these extreme conditions quark degrees of freedom become important .    to address these issues",
    "it is necessary to build theories which incorporate quark - gluon degrees of freedom and which help to bridge the gap between nuclear phenomenology and the underlying physics of strong interactions .",
    "an important criteria for these new models is that they reproduce results based on the established hadronic framework .    guided by the symmetry breaking pattern of qcd",
    ", much effort has recently been devoted to the study of effective lagrangians for low - energy strong interactions .",
    "a typical example is the nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "these models are mainly concerned with the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry but it is not clear if basic features of nuclear phenomenology , such as saturation of nuclear matter , can be described properly . on the other hand , almost a decade ago , guichon @xcite proposed a quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model in which nucleons arise as mit bags interacting through meson mean fields .",
    "this model was refined later by including center - of - mass corrections @xcite and applied to nuclear matter @xcite and also , more recently , to finite nuclei @xcite    although it provides a simple and attractive framework to describe nuclear systems in terms of quark degrees of freedom , the qmc model has a serious shortcoming .",
    "it predicts much smaller scalar and vector potentials than obtained in successful hadronic models @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the nucleon mass is much too high @xcite and the spin - orbit force is too weak to explain spin - orbit splittings and spin observables in finite nuclei .    a well established framework for relativistic hadronic models is provided by quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "numerous calculations have established that relativistic mean - field models based on qhd provide a realistic description of the bulk properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "one of the key observations in their success is that nucleon propagation in the nuclear medium is described by a dirac equation featuring large scalar and vector potentials .",
    "they emerge from the interaction of a nucleon with all other nucleons in the fermi sea via the exchange of isoscalar scalar and vector mesons .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the small vector and scalar potentials in the qmc model are due to the assumption that the bag constant does not change in the nuclear environment @xcite . by introducing a density dependent bag constant",
    "it was demonstrated that large scalar and vector potentials can be produced .",
    "a necessary condition is that the value of the bag constant in the nuclear environment significantly drops below its free - space value . as a consequence",
    "relativistic nuclear phenomenology can be recovered from a modified quark - meson coupling ( mqmc ) model @xcite .",
    "the central issue of the mqmc model is the density dependence of the bag constant .",
    "a priori this is not known and the idea of the mqmc model is to parametrize the bag constant and to determine the parameters by calibrating to observed nuclear properties .",
    "two different model types have been proposed @xcite : a direct coupling model in which the bag constant is a function of the scalar field and a scaling model in which the bag constant is related to the effective nucleon mass . the density dependence is then generated self - consistently in terms of these in - medium quantities",
    ". however , the proposed models are not flexible enough to predict nuclear matter properties on a satisfactory level .",
    "the trend in the mqmc model is to predict reasonable values for the effective nucleon mass but compressibilities which are too high and vice versa @xcite .",
    "we adopt the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite with the goal of generalizing the proposed models .",
    "we assume two different functional forms for the bag constant .",
    "in one case it depends on the scalar field only ; in our second model we study the bag constant as a function of the effective nucleon mass . to provide sufficient flexibility we model the functional form by using polynomial and pade parametrizations .",
    "the unknown coefficients serve as our model parameters .",
    "we investigate how well the models can be calibrated by fitting the parameters to properties of nuclear matter , which we take to be : the equilibrium density and binding energy ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , the nucleon effective ( or dirac ) mass at equilibrium ( @xmath2 ) and the compression modulus ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in general the models contain more parameters than there are normalization conditions .",
    "thus families of models can be generated which describe exactly the same nuclear matter properties at equilibrium .",
    "this allows us to study different physical situations and to search for model dependence in the predictions .",
    "because the qmc model was proposed to describe `` new '' physics beyond the standard hadronic picture in nuclear matter and finite nuclei , we address the crucial question if the model is consistent with established results . as a first step we investigate the connection between the mqmc model and qhd .",
    "we demonstrate that in nuclear matter the mqmc energy functional is formally equivalent to the expression obtained in qhd with a general nonlinear scalar potential .",
    "the quark substructure is entirely contained in the scalar potential and , in principle , this provides a tool to generate hadronic potentials based on a quark model .",
    "the explicit form of the hadronic potential depends on the model which is employed for the bag constant . thus determining the parameters on the quark level",
    "is equivalent to calibrating the potential on the hadronic level which is a well established procedure in nuclear matter calculations @xcite .",
    "we apply our model to symmetric nuclear matter and compare the predictions with qhd mean - field calculations .",
    "we employ a version of qhd which contains quartic and cubic scalar self - interactions @xcite and which is calibrated to reproduce the same nuclear matter properties as the mqmc model .",
    "we show that different parametrizations and models for the bag constant lead to equivalent nuclear properties at low and moderate densities . in this region",
    "the mqmc model predictions are in excellent agreement with qhd .",
    "in contrast , the original version of the qmc model leads to substantially different results .",
    "hence we are lead to the satisfactory conclusion that our generalized mqmc model predicts nuclear matter properties of the same quality as other established mean - field models .",
    "the key to this success is the correlation between the bag constant and nuclear matter properties . confirming the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , we find that the bag constant has to be significantly smaller than its free - space value to reproduce the desired effective nucleon mass at equilibrium .",
    "more importantly , the explicit value of the bag constant at equilibrium is model independent , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the details of the parametrization .",
    "the exact density dependence of the bag constant is essentially unknown .",
    "however , based on general theoretical arguments scaling relations among in - medium quantities have been proposed in the recent literature @xcite . since our approach establishes a direct connection between nuclear phenomenology and the quark substructure we investigate to what extent the proposed scaling relation between the bag constant and the effective nucleon mass is realized ; at this point we encounter a clear model dependence . although all our models are calibrated to produce identical nuclear matter properties we can build models which exactly follow the proposed scaling relation but also models which differ considerably .",
    "a similar model dependence can be observed for the bag radius . in accordance with previous studies @xcite",
    "we find a sizable increase of the bag radius as a consequence of the decreasing bag constant .",
    "however , the quantitative predictions exhibit a strong model and parameter dependence .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give a short description of the qmc model and and summarize the relations which determine the nuclear matter properties .",

    "the key quantity here really is the effective nucleon mass .    at this point , some caveats concerning the comparison with other approaches must be added .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the prediction of a reduced bag constant in the nuclear environment is also a common feature in effective models for low energy qcd , _",
    "e.g. _ chiral models . since none of these models",
    "can strictly be derived from qcd it is not clear to what extent results can be compared . within the mqmc approach , it was one of our goals to demonstrate that it is possible to obtain nuclear matter results which are of the same quality as in any other successful hadronic mean - field model .",
    "in contrast , chiral models are more concerned with the description of the underlying physics , _ i.e. _ the breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it has not been demonstrated whether it is possible to describe nuclear saturation and properties of finite nuclei on that level .",
    "the corresponding bag radius is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] . as a consequence of the rapidly decreasing bag constant the mqmc models predict a picture of a significantly  swollen  nucleus @xcite .",
    "this effect is most drastic in mqmc@xmath62 for vanishing quark - meson couplings .",
    "as mentioned above , the effective nucleon mass and therefore also the bag constant vanishes at some finite value of the density .",
    "consequently , the radius diverges at this point .",
    "although all the models produce identical nuclear matter properties near equilibrium they yield significantly different radii , even at low densities . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] is the curve @xmath101 which indicates the  critical ",
    "radius where the individual bags start overlapping , signaling the breakdown of the simple bag model . in our model",
    "this occurs slightly above the saturation density .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast to the original qmc model which predicts a nearly constant radius .",
    "we emphasize that it is not possible to achieve reasonable nuclear matter properties and a small radius at the same time because the calibration procedure determines the value of the bag constant . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bagsat ] , the acceptable range of @xmath102 always requires a small value of @xmath8 which in turn leads to a large radius .",
    "this is certainly a dilemma .",
    "on one hand we have demonstrated that the mqmc model can be improved and calibrated so that nuclear matter properties are accurately reproduced .",
    "the most important quantity here is the effective nucleon mass which is tightly constrained by nuclear observables @xcite . on the other hand we found that the required bag constant in the medium leads to radii which are unreasonably high .",
    "furthermore the radii are very sensitive to the model features and parametrizations .",
    "the size of a nucleon in matter is certainly a subtle concept and one might argue that physical observables do not depend on the bag radius @xcite",
    ". however , it is an important phenomenological quantity in many nuclear physics issues where bag models are employed to describe features which depend on the intrinsic structure of the nucleon ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , one motivation for generating the nuclear equation of state on basis of a quark model is the hope that such an approach is well suited to describe systems at high densities where quark degrees of freedom become important .",
    "however , because of the large radii and the picture of overlapping bags it is not clear how far the equation of state can be extrapolated into the high - density regime .",
    "in this paper we study properties of nuclear matter based on an improved quark - meson coupling model . this model describes nucleons as nonoverlapping mit bags interacting through scalar and vector mean fields .",
    "of central importance is the bag constant which we assume to depend on the density of the nuclear environment .",
    "we study two types of models for the bag constant in which the density dependence is parametrized in terms of in - medium quantities . in one",
    "we assume that the bag constant depends on the scalar field only and in another the density dependence is related to the effective nucleon mass .    by performing a redefinition of the scalar field",
    "we demonstrate that the resulting energy functional corresponds to a qhd - type hadronic mean - field model with a general nonlinear scalar potential . in principle , this connection can be used to generate hadronic potentials from quark models .",
    "moreover , a direct relation between nuclear phenomenology and the quark picture arises .",
    "we use this connection to motivate our models for the density dependence of the bag constant .    for the explicit calculations we employ a polynomial and a pade form to model the medium dependence of the bag constant .",
    "the unknown parameters can then be fit to properties of nuclear matter near equilibrium that are known to be characteristic of the observed bulk and single - particle properties of nuclei .",
    "our basic goal is to study properties of nuclear matter .",
    "we investigate whether the models for the bag constant lead to results which are consistent with established hadronic models .",
    "this is relevant in view of the hope to apply quark models to describe `` new '' physics which goes beyond the hadronic picture .",
    "because of the relation between mqmc and qhd we compare our results with a qhd model calibrated to produce the same equilibrium properties . as the basic result we find an excellent agreement between our refined mqmc models and qhd at low and moderate densities .",
    "in particular it is possible to reproduce the desired saturation properties and large scalar and vector potentials as demanded by nuclear phenomenology .",
    "the central quantity here is the effective nucleon mass .",
    "its accurate reproduction requires a rapidly decreasing bag constant below nuclear matter densities which leads to a satisfactory saturation mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the original qmc model predicts a very high effective nucleon mass and saturation is achieved on much smaller energy scales .",
    "moreover , the calibration procedure determines the value of the bag constant as a function of the effective nucleon mass in a model independent manner .",
    "however , this does not imply that the density dependence of @xmath8 is well constrained . on the contrary",
    ", we find that models which reproduce identical properties of nuclear matter can be generated from different parametrizations and models for the bag constant .",
    "in particular there is no clear evidence for a specific scaling behavior of @xmath8 .",
    "we observe a similar model dependence in the predicted bag radius . as a consequence of the decreasing bag constant the size of",
    "the nucleon significantly increases in all our models .",
    "this effect is even more drastic than in earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "we find that the nucleon bags start overlapping at densities slightly above the saturation point signaling the break down of the model .",
    "moreover , different models and parametrizations which are equivalent near equilibrium produce different high - density equations of states .",
    "a similar picture arises in hadronic mean - field models @xcite .",
    "thus , even if quark degrees of freedom are incorporated it is unclear how far the nuclear equation of state can be extrapolated into the high - density regime .    in recent applications",
    "the original qmc model was used to estimate the density dependence of quark condensates and other hadron masses @xcite . in view of our results",
    "we expect that the predictions for these quantities change drastically if the density dependence of the bag constant is taken into account .",
    "it is also important to investigate the uncertainties in these quantities which arise from the model and parameter dependence of the bag constant .    in summary",
    "we conclude that an improved qmc model provides a very satisfactory description of nuclear matter near equilibrium .",
    "phenomenological information in terms of equilibrium properties of nuclear matter can be used to constrain the unknown density dependence of the bag constant . on the hadronic level",
    "different models predict equivalent equation of states at low and moderate densities .",
    "this picture changes if microscopic quantities on the quark level are considered . here a clear model and parameter dependence emerges .",
    "the difficulties rely on the detailed density dependence of the bag constant .",
    "although these details have minor impact on the nuclear matter properties , microscopic quantities like the nucleon radius appear to be very sensitive .",
    "it is important to have these uncertainties under control before one can make reliable statements about the physics beyond the standard hadronic picture . to achieve this goal more detailed empirical information on effective",
    "hadron masses and also additional observables from finite nuclei might provide useful constrains to reduce model and parameter dependence in the future .",
