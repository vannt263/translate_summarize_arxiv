    "it has been suggested  and it is now widely accepted  that the kinematical , dynamical and chemical properties of the most massive globular cluster of the milky way , omega centauri ( @xmath0cen , ngc5139 ) , can all be understood if it is the surviving remnant of a larger system , captured and partially disrupted by the milky way many gyrs ago ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the origin of the extreme he - rich stars hosted on its blue main sequence ( bms ) still awaits a satisfactory explanation .",
    "here we propose a possible solution , in the framework of a chemical evolution model which reproduces other major observed properties of the cluster , namely , its stellar metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , age - metallicity relation ( amr ) , trends of several abundance ratios with metallicity and na - o anticorrelation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; see @xcite , 2010 ) .",
    "in order to reproduce all the relevant observations , the parent galaxy must experience both infall of gas of primordial chemical composition and outflow of processed matter .",
    "the key assumption that allows the formation of extreme he - rich stars is that , while supernova ( sn ) ejecta are efficiently lost through the galactic outflow , elements restored to the interstellar medium ( ism ) by gentle winds from both asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and fast rotating massive stars ( frmss ) are mostly retained in the cluster potential well ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "he and na are dispersed in the ism through slow stellar winds by both agbs and frmss .",
    "o , instead , as well as other heavy elements , is expelled by massive stars through fast polar winds .",
    "hence , in the framework of our model , he and na are preferentially retained inside the cluster potential well , while o is mainly vented out through the galactic outflow .",
    "this naturally produces the na - o anticorrelation and he - rich bms population , as observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right - hand panels ) .",
    "the coexistence of populations with ` normal ' and ` high ' he content at [ fe / h ]  @xmath11.4 is expected if he is removed with different intensities from different regions of the proto - cluster .",

    "<S> in this contribution we discuss the origin of the extreme helium - rich stars which inhabit the blue main sequence ( bms ) of the galactic globular cluster omega centauri . in a scenario where the cluster is the surviving remnant of a dwarf galaxy ingested by the milky way many gyr ago , the peculiar chemical composition of the bms stars can be naturally explained by considering the effects of strong differential galactic winds , which develop owing to multiple supernova explosions in a shallow potential well . </S>"
