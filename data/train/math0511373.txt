    "our main result is an explicit computation of the bochner - martinelli residue current @xmath71 in case @xmath5 is the origin . before stating it",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "we say that a subset @xmath96 is _ essential _ if there exists a facet @xmath97 of @xmath52 such that @xmath80 lies in @xmath97 and if in addition @xmath80 spans @xmath98 , that is @xmath99 .",
    "it follows , when @xmath41 , that the essential sets are contained in the newton diagram @xmath53 .",

    "but if @xmath80 is contained in a coordinate plane , @xmath80 can not span @xmath98 . also , when @xmath41 , all points in @xmath102 are in fact contained in some essential set .",
    "next , if @xmath80 is a subset of @xmath42 , let @xmath103 . notice that if @xmath80 is essential , then @xmath104 lies on @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , @xmath106 is the barycenter of the simplex spanned by @xmath80 .",
    "we are now ready to formulate our main theorem .",
    "[ main_thm ] let @xmath107 be a tuple of monomials in @xmath3 such that @xmath108 , and let @xmath71 be the corresponding bochner - martinelli residue current .",
    "then @xmath109 where @xmath110\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge   \\dbar \\big[\\frac{1}{z_n^{\\alpha^b_n}}\\big]\\wedge e_b,\\ ] ] and where @xmath111 is a constant that is nonzero if @xmath80 is an essential set and zero otherwise .",
    "an immediate consequence is that if @xmath80 is essential then @xmath112 where @xmath113 just denotes the ideal of holomorphic functions annihilating @xmath84 . note in particular that @xmath113 depends only on the set @xmath80 and not on the remaining @xmath42 . furthermore , since the basis elements @xmath114 are all different it follows that @xmath115 thus , @xmath116 is fully determined by the newton diagram @xmath53 and the points in @xmath42 lying on it .",
    "in particular @xmath116 depends only on the ideal , not on the particular choice of generators .",
    "we also see that different monomial ideals @xmath48 and @xmath117 give rise to the same annihilator ideal if and only if @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , theorem  [ main_thm ] implies that the inclusion   is strict unless we have a complete intersection .",

    ". then @xmath121 if and only if @xmath48 can be generated by a complete intersection .",
    "for the proof we need a simple lemma .",

    "suppose that @xmath122 .",
    "we have that @xmath126 precisely when one of the generators of @xmath113 divides @xmath127 , that is , when @xmath128 this set of inequalities holds for all @xmath129 , and it is easy to see that this implies first that @xmath130 for at most one @xmath12 , which means that @xmath131 lies in one of the coordinate axes , and second that there is at least one @xmath131 intersecting each coordinate axis .",
    "thus , @xmath80 intersects all coordinate axes in @xmath100 , which in turn implies that @xmath123 is a complete intersection .",
    "we need to show the `` only if '' direction .",
    "suppose that @xmath132 and let @xmath80 be an essential subset .",
    "clearly essential subsets always exist , since otherwise @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the whole ring of holomorphic functions , which contradicts that @xmath41 .",
    "now , in particular @xmath122 , and by lemma  [ kaffi ] , @xmath123 is a complete intersection .",
    "thus @xmath135 where the second equality follows since @xmath113 only depends on @xmath80 and not on @xmath42 . hence @xmath136 and",
    "the result follows .",
    "we give some examples to illustrate theorems  [ main_thm ] and  [ main_corollary ] .",
    "[ basex ] let @xmath137 we identify the ideal @xmath48 with the set @xmath138 as in figure 1 , where we have also depicted the newton diagram @xmath139 .",
    "such pictures of monomial ideals are usually referred to as _ staircase diagrams _ , see  @xcite .",
    "the points in @xmath42 should be recognized as the `` inner corners '' of the staircase .",
    "[ staircase ]     and the newton diagram @xmath53 in example  [ basex ] ]    the newton diagram @xmath53 consists of two facets , one with vertices @xmath140 and @xmath141 and the other one with vertices @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and thus we have the essential sets @xmath143 with @xmath144 respectively .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ main_thm ] that @xmath145 which is equal to the ideal @xmath146 , see figure  2 .",
    "observe that @xmath116 is given by the staircase diagram with @xmath147 as `` outer corners '' .",
    "note also that @xmath116 does not depend on @xmath148 , which lies in the interior of @xmath52 .",
    "[ banni ]     ( dark grey ) and @xmath48 ( light grey ) in example  [ basex ] ]    [ fullstex ] consider the complete intersection @xmath149 .",
    "the associated newton diagram is the @xmath150-simplex spanned by @xmath151 and there exists only one essential set , namely @xmath42 itself , with @xmath152 .",
    "thus according to theorem  [ main_thm ] , @xmath153 so the annihilator ideal is equal to @xmath48 , which we already knew .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the two ways of thinking of the ideal when @xmath154 ; either as a staircase with @xmath155 and @xmath156 as inner corners or as a staircase with @xmath157 as the ( only ) outer corner .",
    "[ kruka ]        [ palm ] we should remark that not all monomial ideals arise as annihilator ideals associated with monomial ideals .",
    "the idea is that the outer corners of the staircase of an annihilator ideal must lie on a hypothetical newton diagram .",
    "indeed , from the discussion just before theorem  [ main_thm ] we know that each @xmath104 corresponding to an essential set @xmath80 lies on @xmath105 .",
    "in other words , the lines joining adjacent outer corners must lie on the boundary of a convex domain above the staircase , and thus a necessary condition is that the `` slope '' of the staircase decreases while we are descending it .",
    "for example , consider the ideal @xmath158 with staircase diagram as in figure 4 , where we have also marked the slope .",
    "[ psalm ]    .",
    "the thick lines illustrate the `` slope '' of the staircase . ]    clearly , the outer corners can not lie on the boundary of a convex newton polyhedron , and thus @xmath0 is not an annihilator ideal .",
    "observe that adding an extra generator to an ideal @xmath48 does not necessarily make the corresponding annihilator ideal smaller or larger .",
    "however , with a fixed newton diagram an extra generator can only make the annihilator ideal smaller .",
    "in fact , given @xmath139 , @xmath116 is maximal if @xmath42 is chosen as the vertex set of @xmath139 and minimal if @xmath42 is all integer points on @xmath139 , as we will see in example  [ hela ] .",
    "let us now consider the inclusion  .",
    "we start by interpreting the left hand side in case @xmath1 is monomial .",
    "first , we make the following observation .",
    "[ loflof ] the integral closure of the monomial ideal @xmath48 is the monomial ideal generated by @xmath159 .",
    "the result is well known from algebraic contexts , see for example  @xcite .",
    "we supply a proof , however , using the analytic definition of integral closure .",
    "we start by proving that @xmath160 for any @xmath161 .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath162 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath163 , we have that @xmath164 for some @xmath165 and @xmath166 and so @xmath167 .",
    "suppose that @xmath168 lies on the facet @xmath97 spanned by @xmath169 .",
    "then @xmath170 for some @xmath171 such that @xmath172 and thus @xmath173 .",
    "observe that @xmath174 if @xmath175 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 . to see this ,",
    "take the logarithm of each side and use that it is a concave function . thus   follows ( and we can choose @xmath30 to be  @xmath176 ) .",
    "conversely , we need to show that   can not hold if @xmath177 .",
    "notice that such a @xmath168 equals @xmath178 for some @xmath165 and @xmath179 .",
    "suppose that @xmath180 lies on the facet @xmath97 with non - negative normal direction @xmath181 and observe that @xmath182 for all @xmath183 .",
    "now , for @xmath184 choose @xmath185 , such that @xmath186 .",
    "then @xmath187 is generated by @xmath188 .",
    "the ideal @xmath189 is generated by @xmath190 ( @xmath191 times ) , so we need to show that the newton polytope of @xmath192 is equal to @xmath193 . but @xmath194 and thus @xmath195 . on the other hand @xmath196 , where the equality holds since @xmath52 is a convex set , and",
    "so it follows that @xmath197 .",
    "suppose @xmath198 .",
    "let @xmath44 be as in theorem  [ main_thm ] .",
    "then the integral closure of the ideal @xmath199 is strictly included in @xmath116 .    observe that corollary  [ yes ] fails when @xmath200 .",
    "then , in fact , @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath202 be the intersection between @xmath53 and the @xmath203-axis and let @xmath204 .",
    "then @xmath205 and thus @xmath206 .",
    "however , @xmath207 for all essential @xmath80 . to see this , observe that the simplex spanned by the intersection points between @xmath139 and the axes separates @xmath139 from @xmath208 , and so @xmath139 intersects the hyperplane @xmath208 only at the point @xmath202 .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath209 for all essential @xmath80 and thus @xmath210 .",
    "hence we have found a function @xmath1 in @xmath211 .",
    "another , probably more illuminating , way of thinking of the ideals is in terms of staircase diagrams as in the examples above . the fact that the ideal @xmath212 is generated by @xmath213 means that its staircase lies just above @xmath105 . on the other hand",
    "we know that the outer corners of the staircase of @xmath116 , the @xmath104 , lie on @xmath105 and therefore the staircase must lie under @xmath105 .",
    "thus the staircase of @xmath116 is `` strictly lower '' than the staircase of @xmath212 and so the corresponding inclusion of ideals is strict . for an illustration ,",
    "see figure  5 , where we have drawn the staircases of the three ideals @xmath48 , @xmath116 and @xmath212 for @xmath42 from example  [ basex ] .",

    "let us say a word about how to see that the currents of lower degree vanish when @xmath5 is the origin .",

    "however , if @xmath415 , the newton polyhedron @xmath52 equals the first orthant and there are no essential sets ; note that this corresponds to the case when @xmath1 contains a nonvanishing function .",
    "thus @xmath416 , where @xmath417 and theorem  [ main_thm ] follows .",
    "of course , by slightly refined arguments one can see how the currents @xmath418 vanish in general .",
    "by theorem  [ rel_thm ] we can extend theorem  [ main_corollary ] to hold for a much larger class of ideals . recall that a crucial point of the proof of theorem  [ main_corollary ] was the existence of essential sets .",

    "in fact , one can show that theorem  [ main_corollary ] holds unless @xmath53 is not parallel to any of the coordinate planes .",
    "yet , there are ideals for which theorem  [ rel_thm ] does not give enough information to decide whether the inclusion   is strict or not , as we will see in example  [ notenough ] . still , in this particular case",

    "there are two essential subsets of @xmath42 , @xmath422 and @xmath423 , with @xmath424 and @xmath425 , respectively .",

    "altogether we get @xmath435 that is equal to @xmath436 , see figure 7 .          in view of example  [ relativeex ]",
    "it should be clear that theorem  [ rel_thm ] actually gives a complete description of @xmath116 in case @xmath154 , provided we choose a minimal set of generators ( or at least avoid to pick redundant generators from the unbounded facets of @xmath52 ) .",
    "[ notenough ] let @xmath0 be the ideal @xmath48 , where @xmath437 the codimension of @xmath438 is @xmath176 and thus @xmath0 is not a complete intersection ( nor can be defined by one ) .",
    "note that the set @xmath42 is to small to be essential , whereas the image of @xmath42 under any projection to @xmath439 is , as shown in figure 8 .",

    "in both of the other cases the projection of @xmath42 lies in a noncompact facet of the newton polyhedron .",

    "we start by considering the term of top degree , @xmath445 for which the result follows easily from the proof of theorem  [ main_thm ] . to see this ,",
    "observe first that the proof of claim  [ claim1 ] does not depend on the codimension of @xmath5 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath446 unless @xmath80 is essential .",

    "more precisely , to determine @xmath379 we will look where @xmath451 of the @xmath452 are nonzero . to do this let us fix @xmath453 and let @xmath454 be the set where @xmath452 is nonvanishing if @xmath455 , that is @xmath456 denote the @xmath457 , by @xmath458 and the @xmath459 , by @xmath408 and write @xmath460 , where @xmath461 and @xmath462 are the images of @xmath463 under @xmath396 and @xmath464 , respectively .",
