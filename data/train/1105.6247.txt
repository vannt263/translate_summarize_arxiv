    "understanding the interaction among nucleons is one of the most important issues in particle and nuclear physics .",
    "in particular , the properties of the three nucleon force ( tnf ) are the forefront of not only particle / nuclear physics but also astro physics . for the binding energies of light nuclei , the two nucleon ( 2n ) force alone underestimates the experimental data , and attractive tnf components are required  @xcite . on the other hand , repulsive tnf components are also necessary in both of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matters , in order to reproduce the empirical saturation density of nuclei in the former case , and to make the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter hard enough to sustain the observed massive neutron star masses in the latter case  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is argued that tnf is responsible for the anomaly in the drip line and the nontrivial magic number of neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite , and could impact on the supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "pioneered by fujita - miyazawa  @xcite , tnf have been commonly studied from the two - pion exchange models with the @xmath4-excitation . however , since tnf is originated by the fact that a nucleon is not a fundamental particle , it is desirable to study tnf from the fundamental degrees of freedom ( dof ) , i.e. , quarks and gluons . in this report , we carry out first - principle calculations of tnf using the lattice qcd technique .    in the lattice qcd calculation of nuclear forces , it is recently proposed  @xcite to use the nambu - bethe - salpeter ( nbs ) wave function so that the potential is faithful to the phase shift by construction .",
    "the obtained ( parity - even ) 2n potentials are found to have desirable features , such as attractive well at long and medium distances , and the central repulsive core at short distance  @xcite .",
    "it is also examined that the non - locality of the obtained potential is small , and the leading terms in the derivative expansion dominate the potential at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the method has been successfully extended to the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) interactions  @xcite including h - dibaryon system  @xcite .",
    "further applications are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this report",
    ", we discuss the extension of this approach to the three nucleon ( 3n ) system , and lattice qcd calculation of tnf in the triton channel is carried out . a preliminary account of this study is also given in ref .",
    "since the detailed formulation for the 2n force is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discuss the extension to the 3n system .",
    "we consider the equal - time nbs wave function @xmath5 , which can be obtained through the six point correlator , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the jacobi coordinates , and @xmath9 denotes either of @xmath10 or @xmath11 . with the derivative expansion of the potentials , the nbs wave function can be converted to the potentials through the following schrdinger equation , @xmath12 \\psi(\\vec{r ' } , \\vec{\\rho } ) = e \\psi(\\vec{r ' } , \\vec{\\rho } ) ,   \\label{eq : sch_3n } \\ ] ] where @xmath13 with @xmath14 denotes the potential between @xmath15-pair , @xmath16 the tnf , @xmath17 , @xmath18 the reduced masses .",
    "if we calculate @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and if all @xmath13 are available by ( separate ) lattice calculations for the genuine 2n system , we can extract @xmath16 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch_3n ] ) .    in practice , however , the calculation cost of @xmath19 is prohibitively expensive .",
    "note that the number of diagrams generated by wick contractions tends to diverge with a factor of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 are numbers of u , d quarks in the system ) .",
    "we develop several techniques to reduce the calculation cost , e.g. , we take advantage of symmetries ( such as isospin symmetry ) , and employ the non - relativistic limit for the source nucleon operator .",
    "similar techniques are ( independently ) developed in the calculations of binding energies of triton / helium nuclei  @xcite . yet",
    ", the calculation cost remains quite expensive , so we consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch_3n ] ) with fixed three - dimensional ( 3d ) coordinates of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    to proceed , we find that the linear setup with @xmath24 is advantageous , where three nucleons are aligned linearly with equal spacings of @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , because of @xmath24 , the third nucleon is attached to @xmath26-nucleon pair with only s - wave .",
    "considering the total 3n quantum numbers of @xmath27 ( triton channel ) , the wave function can be completely spanned by only three bases , which can be labeled by the quantum numbers of @xmath26-pair as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the schrdinger equation leads to the @xmath31 coupled channel equations with the bases of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the reduction of the dimension of bases is expected to improve the s / n as well .",
    "even when we calculate with the fixed 3d - configuration ( with the linear setup or whatever ) , the identification of genuine tnf remains nontrivial .",
    "this is because the parity - odd 2n potentials are not available in lattice qcd at this moment , and we can not subtract the contribution of @xmath35 unambiguously . note that although the total parity of the 3n system can be projected , a 2n - pair inside the 3n system could be either of positive or negative parity .",
    "the familiar procedure of partial wave expansion can not be performed here , since we calculate only fixed 3d - configurations to reduce the calculation cost .    to overcome this problem , we find that the following channel in the triton is useful , @xmath36   .",
    "\\label{eq : psi_s } \\ ] ] this wave function itself has been well known , but the point here is that it is anti - symmetric in spin / isospin spaces for any 2n - pair .",
    "combined with the pauli - principle , it is automatically guaranteed that any 2n - pair couples with even parity only .",
    "therefore , we can extract tnf unambiguously in this channel , without the information of parity - odd 2n potentials .",
    "note that no assumption on the choice of 3d - configuration is imposed in this argument , and we can take advantage of this feature in future tnf calculations with 3d - configurations other than the linear setup .",
    "we employ @xmath0 dynamical clover fermion configurations generated by cp - pacs collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we use 598 configurations at @xmath2 with the lattice size of @xmath37 , which corresponds to @xmath38 box in physical spacial size with the lattice spacing of @xmath39 .",
    "we calculate at the hopping parameter of @xmath40 , @xmath41 quarks @xmath42 , which corresponds to @xmath3 gev , @xmath43 gev .",
    "we use the wall quark source with coulomb gauge fixing . in order to enhance the statistics",
    ", we perform the calculation for sources on 16 time slices for each configuration .",
    "we perform the calculation with the linear setup at ten physical points of the distance @xmath44 .",
    "since we have only one channel ( eq .  ( [ eq : psi_s ] ) ) which is free from parity - odd 2n potentials , we can determine one type of tnf .",
    "in this report , we consider the scalar / isoscalar type tnf . in the urbana ix model  @xcite , which is an often - used phenomenological tnf ,",
    "tnf consists of two parts , one is the two - pion exchange tnf and the other is phenomenologically introduced scalar / isoscalar repulsive tnf . since the two - pion exchange tnf is expected to be suppressed in the current lattice setup of @xmath3 gev , it is reasonable to assume the scalar / isoscalar nature for tnf here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3n ] ( left ) , we plot each wave function of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath34 in the triton channel at @xmath47 .",
    "we observe that @xmath48 dominates the wave function .",
    "this is because @xmath48 contains the component for which all three nucleons are in s - wave . by solving the @xmath31",
    "coupled channels and subtracting the @xmath35 from the total potentials , we determine tnf . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3n ] ( right ) , we plot the results for the scalar / isoscalar tnf . here",
    ", the @xmath44-independent shift by energies is not included , and thus about @xmath49 mev systematic error is understood . at the long distance region of @xmath44 , tnf is small as is expected . at the short distance region , we observe the indication of repulsive tnf . recalling that the repulsive short - range tnf is phenomenologically required in high density matter , this is very encouraging result .",
    "of course , we note that further researches are necessary , e.g. , the examination of the discretization error and the dependence on the quark masses . studies along this line is currently underway .",
