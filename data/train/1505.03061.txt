    "half a century ago the quark model was introduced to describe the large array of hadrons , within which mesons are composed of @xmath9 bound together by the strong interaction and baryons consist of three quarks . since",
    "then the quark model has offered a useful tool in understanding the substructures of hadrons and led to the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for describing the strong interaction . with the development of accelerators and detectors , hundreds of hadrons",
    "have been discovered and the quark model provides a good description of the observed hadrons , in particular the ground states and the heavy quarkonium states . taking charmonium spectroscopy , bound states of the charmed quark and antiquark ( @xmath3 ) , as an example , it reflects a beautiful regularity and numerous electromagnetic and strong transitions .",
    "but there are still many unseen states predicted by the quark model , in particular the @xmath0 states , for which the experimental situation is not well understood .",
    "being the bound state of a light @xmath10 and anti-@xmath10 quark , a strangeonium state is related to long - range ( i.e. , confinement ) interactions , which provide information on non - perturbative qcd in the low energy region , where the heavy quark effective theory is not applicable .",
    "the study of the strangeonium mesons are of particular interest since they are a bridge between the light @xmath11 , @xmath12 quarks and the heavy @xmath13 , @xmath14 quarks .",
    "in addition , the strangeonium spectrum also helps identify the exotics ( e.g. , glueball , hybrid , multi - quark states ) which can decay into the same final states . within the framework of the relativistic quark model with qcd  @xcite ,",
    "a spectroscopy similar to heavy quarkonia is expected for strangeonium ( @xmath0 ) states .",
    "their decays were studied in detail with the @xmath15 model  @xcite , which is a phenomelogical theory for describing light meson decays . the @xmath0 spectroscopy with spin @xmath16 predicted by the @xmath15 model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ strange ] .",
    "only seven states ( underlined with the solid lines ) have been established and many members of the spectrum are still missing .",
    "the poor experimental situation is largely due to the small fractions of @xmath0 states produced among hadrons , and their large width . at present the experimental information on the strangeonium states mainly came from the diffractive photoproduction reactions @xmath17 , strangeness exchange reactions @xmath18 , and @xmath7 collisions . given our unsatisfactory knowledge of strangeonium , the search for these missing states is critical for understanding the @xmath9 interaction .        in this paper , we will review the experimental status of strangeonia , show the possible @xmath4 and @xmath19 decays best suited for the search and study of new strangeonia , and propose approaches to search for new strangeonium - like states similar to the charmonium - like states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , which were discovered at the babar , belle and besiii experiments .",
    "we identify the @xmath23 interaction as an especially important data sample to reconstruct new @xmath0 mesons with high efficiency in a mode independent way .",

    "starting with the @xmath25 state , the @xmath24 was discovered a half century ago in bubble chamber experiments  @xcite . since then the @xmath24 ,",
    "being a pure su(3 ) singlet , has attracted both theoretical and experimental attention due to its special role in understanding low energy qcd .",
    "because of the chiral anomaly , the @xmath24 is a non - goldstone boson which distinguishes itself from the others in the ground pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "therefore the @xmath24 provides a unique field to test the fundamental symmetries and the predictions for chiral perturbative theory .",
    "in addition , the @xmath26 mixing issue remains .",
    "of interest is the gluonic content in @xmath24 , which makes this case more complicated .",
    "many interesting and important issues are extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general our present knowledge of the @xmath24",
    "is based on limited statistics ; only its most dominant decays have been observed , and are not well measured . to perform high statistics measurements , the study of @xmath24 decays has already been listed in the physics programs of many experiments , including clas , crystal ball , wasa - at - cosy and kloe-2 .",
    "in addition to @xmath8-charm physics , besiii also has the capability to investigate @xmath24 decays via @xmath4 radiative or hadronic decays .",
    "based on a sample of @xmath27 @xmath4 events , besiii has made many important contributions to the study of @xmath24 decays , including the measurements of @xmath24 hadronic decays  @xcite , and the search for rare or forbidden decays  @xcite .",
    "another well established strangeonium is the @xmath29 , which is the @xmath28 state .",
    "the @xmath1 meson was first seen in a bubble chamber experiment at brookhaven in 1962 , was subsequently determined to be a vector meson with @xmath30 , and could be accommodated as an su(3 ) singlet , supplementing an octet of other vector mesons ( e.g. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "to explain that @xmath1 prefers to decay into two kaons but not @xmath34 , the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule  @xcite was introduced .",
    "the @xmath1 contains a @xmath0 pair ; when it decays , the strange quarks have to go somewhere , and the kaon pair route is the only possibility .",
    "since it has a quite narrow width and could be directly produced in @xmath7 collisions , a @xmath1 factory , named da@xmath35ne , was built to study its properties using the abundant production of @xmath1 collected with the kloe detector , which had made a significant contribution to kaon and hadronic physics in the low qcd energy region .",
    "an upgrade of da@xmath35ne and the kloe detector were performed .",
    "the luminosity was designed to be improved by a factor of 3 and the detector was also upgraded accordingly .",
    "a review of the physics with the kloe-2 detector at da@xmath35ne is given in ref .",

    "the @xmath37 strangeonium state , @xmath36 , is still a poorly known meson . in 1988 , the first evidence of the @xmath37 strangeonium state was seen by the lass spectrometer at slac , from a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed in the @xmath39 by the crystal barrel detector at lear with a mass of @xmath40mev/@xmath41 and a width of @xmath42mev  @xcite . due to the severe suppression by the phase space ,",
    "its dominant decay is @xmath43 .",

    "there is some theoretical interest in @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses the origin of this state in chiral dynamics from the interaction of the vector - pseudoscalar .",
    "the first evidence for the @xmath44 was seen in the @xmath46 mass spectrum in @xmath47 reactions  @xcite , but it is questionable because the structures around 1.4@xmath481.5gev ( e.g. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) are found to be complicated .",
    "detailed analyses  @xcite confirmed its existence and the spin - parity is determined to be @xmath51 .",
    "the observations of @xmath44 in central production  @xcite provides unambiguous evidence that @xmath44 has spin 1 and suggests a non - strange quark component in @xmath44 despite its decay to @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath44 is not seen in the strange exchange @xmath53 interactions , in which another meson , the @xmath54 , possibly having large @xmath0 components , is observed .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that the @xmath44 could be a hybrid  @xcite , a four quark  @xcite or a molecular - like state  @xcite .",
    "this state has also been investigated in radiative and hadronic decays of the @xmath4 .",
    "mark iii  @xcite reported a structure around 1.42gev observed in the @xmath46 mass spectrum in @xmath55 , but no similar peak was seen in @xmath56 .",
    "these results were confirmed by the besii experiment  @xcite using the 58 million @xmath4 events .",
    "the mass and width obtained from a fit to the @xmath52 mass are consistent with those of the @xmath44 .",
    "the spin - parity is not determined here due to the large background .",
    "the amplitude analyses of @xmath57 indicates that the structure observed around 1.42gev in the @xmath58 mass spectrum is a mixture of two or three states  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 could be the @xmath45 @xmath0 state instead of the @xmath44 due to its production in hadronic @xmath59 experiments .",
    "however , the absence of the @xmath54 in hadronic and radiative @xmath4 decays makes this case complicated .",
    "given the complexity in the @xmath60 system , it is important to extract these states in @xmath4 decays using high statistics data which will enable pwa .",
    "in addition to @xmath43 , the observation of new decay modes , e.g. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , could also provide valuable information on the @xmath44 .",
    "recently , besiii reported evidence for @xmath54 observed in @xmath63 decays  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath64 is widely accepted as the @xmath65 state , which was first seen in @xmath66 collisions with limited statistics . since then",
    "this state has been observed in many different production processes , including @xmath59 collisions , @xmath7 annihilations , @xmath67 annihilations , and @xmath68 collisions .",
    "given that it decays dominantly into a @xmath69 instead of a @xmath70 and is only observed in @xmath71 decays , it seems to be a @xmath0 meson .",
    "a new idea that the @xmath64 is dynamically generated from the vector - vector interaction has been introduced in ref .",

    "@xcite , in which approaches to study the production of @xmath64 and other resonances ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) in the @xmath4 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 decays are broadly discussed .",
    "the @xmath78 is well established in @xmath7 production .",

    "the absence of @xmath78 in @xmath82 indicates that the @xmath78 is the promising 2@xmath83s@xmath84 @xmath85 candidate because it prefers to decay into strange mesons as expected from the ozi rule .",
    "the b factories  @xcite observed the @xmath78 via the isr process and found a new decay mode of @xmath86 .    the @xmath78 is also expected to be observed in photoproduction experiments .",
    "however , the latest results on @xmath87 show a clear structure in the @xmath81 mass spectrum with a mass of @xmath88mev/@xmath41 and a width of @xmath89mev , which is in good agreement with results from previous photoproduction experiments .",
    "the mass is much higher than the 1680mev/@xmath41 reported from @xmath7 experiments .",
    "no structure was observed around the 1.68gev/@xmath41 or 1.75gev/@xmath41 mass regions in the @xmath90 interaction .",
    "the discrepancy on the measured mass between experiments could be explained by the interference with other mesons .",
    "the probability that the structure around 1.75gev / c@xmath91 observed in the photoproduction process is a new state can not be ruled out  @xcite .",
    "therefore , study of the @xmath78 is necessary to clarify its nature .",
    "based on the prediction of the @xmath92 model , the branching fraction of @xmath78 decaying into @xmath93 is smaller than those of @xmath69 and @xmath43 .",

    "a study of the @xmath46 mass spectrum in the same experiment also indicated a structure around 1.85gev/@xmath41 and production rate compatible with the @xmath69 decay mode .",
    "the omega experiment  @xcite observed a similar structure in the hypercharge exchange reaction @xmath99 .",
    "its spin - parity was determined to be @xmath100 , which is consistent with the absence of @xmath94 in the reaction @xmath101 .",
