    "small angle scattering ( sas ) is sensitive to the presence of structural and chemical inhomogeneities inside the systems , which behave as scattering entities . here and in the program",
    ", we shall refer to these entities as _ scattering particles _ whenever they do not bear a charge and _ macroions _ otherwise . in the latter case a set of smaller scattering cores ( _ counterions _ with opposite charge ) are clearly present to satisfy electroneutrality .",
    "polydispersity means that the particles are not all identical but their size , charge or other properties exhibit a large variety of values ( a phenomenon commonly found , for instance , in colloidal and micellar suspensions ) .",
    "hence in presence of polydispersity sas intensity may greatly differ from that of monodisperse systems .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present a code ( flac ) which can be used in the analysis of experimental data of small - angle neutron scattering from polydisperse systems .",
    "the flac program provides the scattering functions from polydisperse fluids of neutral @xcite or charged hard spheres @xcite , based on the analytical solutions of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equations within the percus - yevick ( py ) or the mean spherical spproximation ( msa ) closures , respectively @xcite . for the sake of clarity and in order to be self - contained , general formulas appearing in the sas theories will now be briefly recalled .      the most general expression of the sas is @xcite    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the macroscopic differential coherent scattering cross section ( scs ) as a function of the exchanged wave vector @xmath5",
    ", whose magnitude is defined by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the neutron wavelength and @xmath8 the full scattering angle . in eq .",
    "[ sas1 ] , the integral is extended over the total sample volume @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the position vector and @xmath11 the local scattering length density . for x - rays ,",
    "the scattering length density is replaced by the electron density , leaving the general formalism unchanged .",
    "the angular brackets @xmath12 represent an ensemble average over all possible positions and orientations of the particles in the system .    in the absence of long range order",
    ", the scattering length density can be thought as having a uniform value @xmath13 on which fluctuations @xmath14 are superimposed .",
    "the distribution of scattering material inside a particle of species @xmath15 is then defined by its form factor    @xmath16    where @xmath17    is the scattering amplitude at zero - angle , and @xmath18 is the volume of the scattering core ( i.e the subregion of a macroparticle which contains the scattering material : nuclei , etc . ) .",
    "often it proves convenient to combine eq .",
    "[ sas8 ] and [ sas9 ] as @xmath19 .",
    "let us assume that the polydisperse system can be regarded as a mixture with @xmath20 components . by introducing an effective form factor @xmath21 as    @xmath22",
    "one can also define an effective structure factor @xmath23 of the mixture by rewriting eq .",
    "[ sas1 ] in the form    @xmath24    here , @xmath21 accounts for the distribution of scattering matter inside the particles , while @xmath23 is related to the particle - particle interactions and the resultant equilibrium structure of the system , and it is defined through eq .",
    "( [ sas12 ] ) .",
    "if the particle - particle interactions are spherically symmetric ( homogeneous and isotropic fluids ) , then the scs can be cast into the fournet - vrij s form @xcite :    @xmath25    \\label{sas11 } \\\\",
    "& + & \\sum_{i , j=1}^p\\sqrt{n_in_j}f_if_j~\\left\\langle b_i(\\bf{q } ) \\right\\rangle _ \\omega \\left\\langle b_j^{*}(\\bf{q})\\right\\rangle _ \\omega ~s_{ij}(q ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the number density of species @xmath15 and the brackets @xmath27 represent angular averages ( this formula being still valid in case of non - spherically symmetric particles ) .",
    "the @xmath28 are the ashcroft - langreth partial structure factors @xcite , defined by",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 is the kronecker delta and @xmath31 is the three - dimensional fourier transform of the total correlation function @xmath32 , which can be obtained by solving the oz integral equations of the liquid state @xcite .    the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "[ sas11 ] is called the `` incoherent '' part , and the remainder the `` coherent '' one .",
    "the incoherent part vanishes if the distribution of scattering matter is spherosymmetric and in this case    @xmath33      fortunately , for most of the investigated systems the particles are formed by a single type of uniform scattering material ( first phase = solute ) and are embedded in a uniform medium ( second phase = solvent for a solution , or matrix for an alloy ) . in this case , @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ sas8 ] can be replaced by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the scattering length density of the scattering particles and the embedding medium , respectively .",
    "thus the zero - angle scattering amplitude ( eq.[sas9 ] ) is given by    @xmath38    and the form factor @xmath39 ( eq .  [ sas8 ] ) becomes    @xmath40      in this case , eq .  [ sas11 ] takes the simple form    @xmath41    then the effective structure factor can be expressed in terms of partial structure factors as    @xmath42    the @xmath39 can be calculated analytically with the result @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the scattering core radius of a particle of species @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the first - order spherical bessel function . in general , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the hard sphere radius of the @xmath15-th particle .",
    "clearly , @xmath49      in the case of micelles or in the presence of a depletion zone around a precipitate , the scattering particles can be thought as a two - shell spheres , characterized by an inner core and an outer shell with different scattering length ( or electron ) densities . even in this case",
    "the form factor @xmath50 has a relatively simple form    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the radii of the inner and outer shell , respectively , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath13 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the scattering length ( or electron ) density of the solvent , of the inner and the outer shell , respectively .",
    "experimental data are in general plagued by several effects which might affect the scattering intensity , as compared to the theoretical one , and hence may lead to an incorrect interpretation .",
    "most of them have been well studied and the way of controlling them is now well established . the instrumental resolution ( i.e. the incident radiation wavelength spread , the finite collimation and the detector resolution ) together with the radial average of the sas data performed when isotropic data are collected on a 2d detector can be computed following the recipe given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where each effect is described by a gaussian contribution , which is also used to model the primary beam for the beam width effect @xcite .",
    "the vertical slit effect is also taken into account in the calculation , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this correction becomes relevant for slit systems and double crystal diffractometers . finally , possible corrections due to multiple scattering are also calculated using the mux routine @xcite , which is based on the theory developed in ref . @xcite .",
    "since sas experiments are performed with more instrumental configurations in order to scan the largest possible q range , up to three different setups are considered during smearing of the scattering intensities .",
    "two different types of background are considered in flac . a flat incoherent one , like a plateau on which the small angle scattering intensity is superimposed , and the porod one .",
    "the latter is due to the asymptotic scattering of large inhomogeneities and can be approximated as @xcite    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the porod constant .",
    "as often reported in the literature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the hard sphere radius @xmath48 of a particle need not coincide with the radius @xmath60 of its scattering core . to include this possibility",
    ", the ratio @xmath61 can be tuned in the program .      for neutral hard spheres ,",
    "the interparticle potential @xmath62 is described as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 .",
    "the oz equations for an hard sphere mixture can be solved by using the py closure .",
    "a closed - form for the sas intensity for polydisperse hard sphere fluids was obtained by vrij @xcite .",
    "our code for this part is constructed along the lines of that reference .      in the case of charged hard spheres ,",
    "the interparticle potential @xmath62 takes the following form    @xmath65    where coulombic ( attractive and repulsive ) interactions are added to the previous neutral case , @xmath66 being the elementary charge , @xmath67 the valence of the @xmath15-th species and @xmath68 the dielectric constant of the solvent .",
    "this potential defines the primitive model of ionic fluids @xcite .",
    "the msa analytical solution of the oz equations for this model allows to write a closed - form for the sas intensity of polydisperse ionic fluids @xcite .",
    "we assume that polydispersity is associated to macroions , whereas counterions are monodisperse .",
    "the electroneutrality condition , necessary to have a stable system , then reads :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the number density and charge of the counterions , respectively .",
    "the flac program is able to calculate the scs of neutral or charged polydisperse hard spheres . in both cases flac",
    "also provides the result corresponding to non - interacting spheres ( i.e. @xmath72 ) .",
    "the scattering density can correspond either to a filled or to a two - shell hollow sphere .",
    "these models are suitable for a large variety of physical systems , among which colloids and mycelles .",
    "flac can work in two different modes : 1 ) it can provide the theoretical calculation of the scattering function , given a set of @xmath73 ( experimental or simulated ) values ; 2 ) it can fit experimental data by using the two models described above .",
    "the first mode is particularly useful to gauge the input parameters as a starting point for the fit .",
    "this is governed by the _",
    "ifit _ flag and it will described in detail below .",
    "the filenames to be used are handled in the subroutine _",
    "file_name _ and the proper input data are read by using the subroutine _",
    "read_data_. subsequently , the subroutine _ control _ checks the consistency of the input values .",
    "if required , the definition of the smearing effects is worked out before the start of the calculation of the scs in the _ fres_prep _ subroutine .",
    "the va05ad routine of the harwell subroutine library ( hsl ) @xcite needs the definition of the functional to be minimized in the _ calfnf _ subroutine and the statistical errors are estimated in the _ kovafd _ routine developed at the institut fr festkrperforschung of the forschungszentrum jlich , germany . in input flac requires a set of physical parameters ( average size of the particles , volume fraction , etc ) plus the parameters of the distribution .",
    "in addition to the two parameters of the distributions considered here ( gaussian , schulz , weibull and log - normal ) a parameter for the normalization is also required .",
    "we remark , however , that these three parameters are actually computed in terms of the above physical parameters . for each @xmath73 value ,",
    "the intensity is calculated by using the subroutine _ intensity _ , where the proper model is selected . at this stage ,",
    "the porod background is considered . in sequence ,",
    "the corrections due to instrumental smearing effects , vertical slit and multiple scattering are performed .",
    "since a flat background does not alter any of the previous corrections , the incoherent background is added at the final stage . during the fit , a file called *",
    ".int * ( see below ) is output at each iteration , for a clearer control of the convergence of the numerical procedure . upon convergence , flac estimates the errors in the physical quantities and reorganizes the data for the output files .      at the initial stage flac requires a filename interactively and then it sets up input and output filenames by appending the proper extension to this filename . a short description of each extension",
