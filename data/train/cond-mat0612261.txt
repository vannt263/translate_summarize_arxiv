    ", we consider single atom transport ( in one dimension ) on a tilted optical lattice in the presence of an external ac field .",
    "to fix ideas , consider the physical situation of an atom interacting with laser field .",
    "we have a single atom a , with an excited state @xmath0 and a ground state @xmath1 separated by an energy interval @xmath2 .",
    "the atom hamiltonian is @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) .",
    "the atom is subjected to a classical laser field with electric field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the laser frequency and @xmath7 is the polarization vector of the laser .",
    "if the amplitude of the electric field e(x ) is varying slowly in space @xmath8 compared to the size of the atom , the atom - field interaction can be described in dipole approximation , i.e. , by the coupling @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic dipole moment .",
    "we assume that laser is far detuned from any optical transition in the atom .",
    "in this simplified picture one uses perturbation theory and eliminate internal atomic states from the dynamics to obtain an effective potential @xmath11 .",
    "the atom hamiltonian thus becomes @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the term @xmath14 is called the rabi frequency which drive the transitions between the two atomic levels .",
    "now consider that the atom is in a non - resonant standing light @xmath15,~two~~counter~propagating~waves)$ ] .",
    "this constitutes the basic optical periodic potential @xmath16 , which can be accelerated by frequency chirping .",
    "lattice potential is tilted in the reference frame of the atom ( co - moving frame ) , and the atomic motion is governed by quantum mechanics of a particle on a periodic lattice ( figure 1 ) .",
    "when there is no acceleration ( no tilt ) , an initially localized wavepacket will spread through resonant bloch tunneling and become delocalized .",
    "but in a tilted lattice ( optical lattice being accelerated analogously electron and crystalline lattice is in an external constant electric field ) atoms can remain localized due to suppression of bloch tunneling .",
    "they exhibit novel quantum phenomenon of bloch oscillations due to the repeated bragg scattering@xcite . in the case of electrons in metals",
    "this corresponds to an induced ac current with applied dc voltage across the sample .",
    "but in usual practice this purely quantum effect is overshadowed by scattering processes and we obtain ohomic dc current .",
    "the second interesting effect of potential tilt is that the bloch bands are broken up into wannier - stark ( ws ) ladders of states@xcite .",
    "the level spacing between two nearby levels in the ladder is given by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the electron charge , @xmath19 is the applied constant electric field and @xmath20 is the lattice spacing , for the case of optical lattice , level spacing @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the imparted acceleration , and @xmath23 is the period of optical potential ) .",
    "as the tilt of potential per lattice spacing becomes comparable to well depth , a new interband tunneling process called landau - zener tunneling becomes important which is a natural extension of the stark effect for a single atom .",
    "now the above stated phenomena are purely quantum in nature .",
    "but the relaxation processes are natural .",
    "no system is an ideally decoupled system for all space and time scales . in case of cold atoms on optical lattices",
    "the main relaxation process is the spontaneous emission of photons by excited atoms .",
    "since photons has finite momentum , it s generation gives a recoil kick to the atom(mechanical effects of light ) .",
    "these relaxation processes decoher pure quantum effects .",
    "the decay of bloch oscillations and the diffusive spreading of the atoms is shown to cause by spontaneous emission@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the presence of relaxation processes are actually important for practical purposes , like ohomic current across metals(joule heating effects ) and atomic current across an optical lattice etc.@xcite .    in the present contribution",
    "we consider the effect of external ac drive on the quantum transport of cold atoms on tilted optical lattice , and the effect of spontaneous emission that cause decoherence , which is essential for diffusive motion .",
    "we have obtained a tunable diffusion co - efficient and it s nonlinear enhancement with increasing drive amplitude and we also report a novel maximum diffusion condition .",
    "the analytical results obtained by us correctly specialize to the exact results known in the limit of zero drive and zero - bias .",
    "also , in addition to cold atoms , the results obtained are applicable to experimentally realizable super lattice hetero - structures that support the stark - wannier ( sw ) ladder states in the presence of a strong longitudinal electric - field bias@xcite .",
    "as is well known , a strong field normal to the superlattice planes can break up the extended bloch - like band continuum into energetically well resolved states localized in the potential wells .",
    "the stronger the biasing field the more localized are the sw state@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model hamiltonian and the simplified master equation for the present system . in section 2.1",
    "we consider the simple case of no acceleration and no external ac drive , and in section 2.2 tilted lattice in the presence of an external ac drive .",
    "we end with brief discussion of results .    [ 0.6 ]",
    "we have three interacting physical systems ( 1 ) the atom ( 2 ) the laser field , and ( 3 ) the vacuum . up to this point",
    "we have not considered atom - vacuum field coupling , which is responsible for spontaneous emission of photons by the excited atom .",
    "the random recoil kicks ( mechanical effects of spontaneously emitted photon momentum ) cause decoherence of atomic motion , which is the main object under study .",
    "spontaneous emission is characterized by the natural width of the excited state or the radiative life - time of the state ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "if we are interested in very short interaction times ( @xmath25 ) , we can neglect spontaneous emission , and the evolution of atom - laser system is described by schrodinger equation .",
    "but for long interaction times @xmath26 , due to the presence of several spontaneous emissions , one can not use schrodinger equation .",
    "in this situation one uses system - environment approach i.e. , the reduced atomic evolution ( traced over infinitely many vacuum field ( environment ) degrees of freedom ) is then given by a master equation . in the present situation of far detuning @xmath27 ,",
    "the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath28 of the atomic motion along the @xmath8 direction is given by a simplified master equation@xcite ( detailed theory is given in@xcite ) : @xmath29 -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\int du p(u)[l_u^{\\dag}l_u\\rho + \\rho l_u^{\\dag}l_u - 2l_u\\rho l_u^{\\dag}]\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30(@xmath31 is the inverse radiative life time of the excited state ) , @xmath32 is the atomic rabi frequency , and @xmath33 is static detuning .",
    "the first term on the rhs gives the unitary evolution , while the second term gives the non - unitary ( incoherent ) evolution causing the initially pure density matrix ( @xmath34 at @xmath35 ) to become mixed ( @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) .",
    "here @xmath38 is the angle distribution of the spontaneously emitted photons , and for linearly polarized light , @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath40 is the projection of photon recoil operator along the atomic direction of motion .",
    "the photon recoil operator represents the coupling of the internal atomic dynamics ( decay processes ) to the external atomic motion(center of mass motion ) . in dipole and rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "@xmath41 the physical effect of the photon recoil operator is to randomly change the atomic quasimomentum .",
    "initial delta function distribution of atomic quasimomentum will be smeared over the entire brillouin zone and cause the decay of bloch oscillations as observed in@xcite .",
    "our approach is based on one band tight binding hamiltonians similar to@xcite(new feature added is the ac drive , section 2.2 ) . in matrix element notation ,",
    "our system hamiltonian and recoil operator is @xmath42 + f d m\\delta_{mn}\\ ] ] @xmath43    here , @xmath44 is the transfer matrix element between nearby states , @xmath45 is the inertial force acting on the atom , @xmath46 is the period of optical potential , and @xmath47 is the localized wannier function @xmath48 associated with the @xmath49th well of the optical periodic potential . in the following sections we will proceed step by step , starting with un - accelerated potential .",
    "we begin by considering first the simplest case of quantum motion of an atom moving on an optical lattice ( figure 2 ) under a tight - binding one - band hamiltonian @xmath50 where ( -@xmath51 ) is the nearest - neighbor transfer matrix element , and the sum is over the @xmath52 sites with @xmath52 taken to be infinite .",
