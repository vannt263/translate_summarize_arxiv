    "in paper @xcite an idea of decreasing the field level on one side of low - profile antennas was proposed and developed .",
    "using such antennas , efficiency can be maintained at a good level even if absorbing bodies are near the antenna but behind the screening substrate , because the power absorbed in the near vicinity of the antenna is reduced .",
    "the idea is based on the usage of artificial impedance surfaces with moderate inductive impedances to form the desired near - field pattern of a horizontal antenna positioned parallel to the impedance surface .",
    "the known solutions for artificial antenna substrates ( e.g. , @xcite ) utilize impedance surfaces in the resonant regime ( as artificial magnetic walls ) in order to reduce the antenna thickness . in papers",
    "@xcite@xcite implied applications of artificial impedance surfaces are within the resonant band .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that the antenna solutions with a high inductive impedance of the ground surface do not correspond to a good screening effect in the near - zone field of horizontal antennas .",
    "the present approach allows an effective reduction of the near field behind the antenna , whereas the required radiation resistance can be achieved with a small increase of the structure thickness ( the primary radiator antenna is positioned at a certain height over the impedance surface ) .",
    "impedance screens of two kinds have been studied .",
    "the first one is so - called _ mushroom _ structure and the second one is a thin layer named _",
    "jerusalem crosses _ structure .",
    "these impedance screens should work well when the surface is of moderate inductive impedance and when the antenna excites mostly te modes ( respectively to the screen normal ) . in this work",
    "we validate experimentally our theoretical expectations designing optimized radiating elements for the use with two different impedance surfaces and measuring the near field distributions around the antenna .",
    "we do not study the far - field pattern since it is not a practically important characteristic for handsets operating in the frequency range 12 ghz .",
    "really , this pattern is weakly directive ( because the antenna of a mobile phone is electrically small ) , and it is perturbed depending on the device position with respect to the user .",
    "however , the non - perturbed field distribution measured in the vicinity of a portable terminal clearly indicates the possible influence of the user body or other nearly located objects to the antenna . if the field behind the terminal ( where the user s body is normally ) is not significant , the user s body will not significantly reduce the antenna efficiency",
    "therefore , we make measurements at the distances of a few centimeters to test the near - field screening efficiency of the artificial impedance surface .",
    "notice , that in the known literature the problem of the improving the antenna efficiency and sar reduction is often considered in terms of far - zone measurements and related with such a parameter of the antenna as the front - to - back ratio in the far zone . following this point of view , if one wants to reduce the sar one should form the far - zone antenna pattern with a small backward radiation @xcite .",
    "this is a potentially misleading approach .",
    "there is no proportionality between the far - zone and the near - zone field patterns , and a high front - to - back ratio for the far - zone fields can correspond to a small front - to - back ratio in the near zone .",
    "only the measurements of the near - field spatial distribution ( and not the field angular dependence since the angular near - field pattern strongly depends on the distance from the antenna ) can definitely indicate the degree of field interactions between the antenna and various objects in its near field .",
    "our measurements are , therefore , not conventional and they became possible due to the use of special equipment dedicated for near - field testing .    in the proposed design ,",
    "the artificial impedance surface ( such as the mushroom structure ) is operating at frequencies below the surface impedance resonance , where the effective surface impedance is inductive and not high in the absolute value . in this frequency range",
    "the surface supports tm - polarized surface waves , whose excitation is not desirable .",
    "this means that we should use a primary radiator that excites ( at least primarily ) te - polarized waves , that is , there should be mainly electric currents parallel to the surface .",
    "a natural choice is a simple dipole antenna positioned parallel to the surface .",
    "another choice criterion is the compact design .",
    "when a dipole antenna is brought close to a surface with a small inductive impedance , its radiation resistance becomes rather low due to cancelation of radiation from the currents induced on the surface .",
    "for this reason , a better choice is a folded dipole because of its high radiation resistance .",
    "the use of a folded dipole requires a balun to connect the dipole to the unbalanced coaxial cable . at the first stages of our experiments we wanted to avoid complications related to any additional elements in the antenna system , and decided to use in experiments only a half of the dipole antenna ( over a half of the artificial impedance surface ) positioned orthogonal to a large metal ground plane .",
    "the mirror image of the half of the antenna simulates the other half , so that the whole system radiates as the complete antenna in the half space where the actual radiator is located .",
    "no balun is needed if the feeding cable is behind the ground plane because no currents are induced on the cable .",
    "after successful tests with this installation , we designed a planar balun , manufactured and tested a complete antenna sample . let us emphasize that our paper is not a description of a new practical antenna with good front - to - back ratio in the far field . the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of handset antennas for the frequency range 12 ghz with reduced interaction with objects in the antenna near field region .",
    "the experimental set - up modeling the complete antenna is shown in figure  [ modeling_setup ] .",
    "it consists of a @xmath0 mm@xmath1 rectangular metal screen with a 50 ohm 3.5 mm coaxial connector in its center and a half of the antenna structure attached to the connector ( and also to the screen , as explained below ) .            neglecting the influence of the finite sizes of the screen and the effect of the finite screen conductivity , a half of the real antenna and its mirror image",
    "can be considered as forming the entire antenna .",
    "the source voltage ( the source is represented by the coaxial connector in our case ) is then applied between the screen and one end of one half of the folded dipole .",
    "the second end of the dipole is connected to the ground ( see figure  [ model_setup_photo ] )",
    ". the impedance surface should also be well electrically connected to the ground .",
    "cabling effects are eliminated here due to the simple fact that the cable is now behind the screen .",
    "it prevents currents from flowing on the outer surface of the coax .",
    "this means that there is no need for a special balancing device which can possibly influence the input impedance measurements , etc .",
    "the input impedance of the complete antenna is two times larger than that measured for a half of the antenna in this experimental set - up .",
    "the field distributions measured in this modeling set - up should correspond to the same distributions for the complete antenna in free space .",
    "the position of the impedance surface is adjustable mechanically , and the separation between the dipole and the surface can be changed .",
    "three types of surfaces have been used in the experiments : a mushroom structure , a metal screen with slits shaped as jerusalem crosses , and a simple metal screen , all of the same surface dimensions .",
    "antenna dimensions were chosen for operation around 1.8  ghz . to take into account the influence of the impedance screen on the effective resonant length of the antenna , measurements with a test microstrip transmission line formed above the impedance screen have been made .",
    "it was found that in the presence of the impedance surface the resonant length is slightly shorter than the same for the antenna in free space .",
    "it has been set approximately to 30 mm ( it is the dipole half - length corresponding to the quarter wavelength distance ) .",
    "folded dipole samples have been prepared from a metallized dielectric material ( sheets of _ fr-4 _ ) .",
    "geometrical parameters for all studied cases ( sizes are in mm , for the definition see figure  [ modeling_setup ] ) are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the last column gives the total thickness of the structures : @xmath2 .",
    "distance _ h _ between the folded dipole and the impedance surface determines the input impedance of the antenna .",
    "the following experimental procedure to find an optimal distance was used .",
    "the working frequency was firstly chosen ( close to 1.8  ghz ) .",
    "then , the distance between the folded dipole and the impedance surface was changed until the imaginary part of the antenna input impedance became zero at the working frequency .",
    "if the real part of the impedance is close to 25 ohm ( note that in the modeling set - up we measure one half of the actual impedance of the complete antenna ) for the same frequency , then the antenna is matched and ready for measurements . if this condition was not reachable , then a frequency close to the original one was chosen and the procedure was repeated .",
    ".dimensions of the antenna elements ( in mm ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath3 the efficiency values were measured in the modeling set - up discussed in section [ half_dip ] .",
    "mm , @xmath4 mm , see figure  [ measproto_path].,width=302 ]     for the magnetic field relative magnitude , db.,width=302 ]",
    "compared to the known designs of antennas utilizing high - impedance surfaces ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , our prototypes are much superior in the screening effect .",
    "we do not know works in which the near - field screening effect would be calculated or measured for antennas operating at 13 ghz . in @xcite the screening effect of 7",
    "db corresponds to the far - zone field , and in @xcite 6 db is the front - to - back ratio ( also a far - zone parameter ) . to compare our results with the basic",
    "known ones we should replace ase introduced in our paper by its analogue in which the far - zone part of our measured data is kept .",
    "estimation of the distance to the far zone is not obvious in this case when the antenna is not electrically large but can not be considered as a point source .",
    "looking at the distance to the far - zone @xmath5 for considerably large antennas z=2g^2 , where @xmath6 mm is the maximal size of our radiating system , and to the same for point dipoles z = and choosing the larger value , we estimate that the distance @xmath7 cm from the antenna ( which corresponds to the @xmath8-coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 mm in fig .",
    "[ measproto_path ] ) can be referred to the far - zone . calculating ase for these distances",
    "we obtain 18 db for the present design against the known 6 - 7 db @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also clearly visible in figures  [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] that the maximal screening effect in our measurements corresponds to relatively large distances .",
    "therefore , we assume that the result of 6 db for the front - to - back ratio in the far zone corresponds to a practically small ase for the near field and does not witness any considerable improvement of the near - field pattern of the antenna .",
    "we also have demonstrated increased radiation efficiency ( 73 - 88 percent against the known 60 percent ) .",
    "however , the designs of @xcite have smaller thicknesses ( approximately 3 mm against our 8 - 12 mm ) .",
    "let us explain this point .",
    "we have tried to achieve a compromise between high near - field screening , high efficiency , and a small thickness with the emphasis on the near - field screening .",
    "notice , that in other known designs , the resonant frequency region of the mushroom surface is used . in that regime the surface operates as a magnetic screen , which means that the radiating element can be brought very close to the surface without cancelation of the radiation resistance .",
    "this allows a compact design .",
    "but , this leads to a smaller screening efficiency @xcite . and",
    "this point was not studied enough in the known literature .",
    "also , the radiation efficiency of an antenna over a high - impedance surface can be lower than in the regime of the moderate surface impedance because of stronger fields in the dielectric substrate . in our design",
    "we work at a frequency much lower than the impedance surface resonance . in this region",
    "the surface impedance is rather low , so that the properties are close to that of an _ electric _ screen .",
    "for this reason we can not bring the primary radiator very close to the surface , and the thickness is increased , but the screening of the back radiation is very much improved .",
    "the bandwidth is the best for the case of the mushroom surface .",
    "the simple metal plate ( @xmath11 ) can be used for screening if we neglect the requirement of the broad band antenna operation ( and allow even thicker design ) .    summarizing",
    ", we can conclude that it has been experimentally demonstrated that simple artificial impedance surfaces can be used in the design of antennas for reducing the near field behind the antenna and increasing the antenna efficiency without any bandwidth reduction .",
