    "the statistical physics of two dimensional systems is fascinating , as it exhibits phases that are critical for a non - vanishing range of parameters . in these phases",
    "there is no true long range order and correlations decay as a power law .",
    "the pioneering work of kosterlitz and thouless @xcite and of berezinskii @xcite laid the foundation for the theoretical analysis of such systems .",
    "this critical behavior requires the symmetry of the hamiltonian with respect to rotation of the order parameter by some angle variable @xmath1 .",
    "its physics is therefore captured by an easy - plane spin hamiltonian known as the @xmath2-model .",
    "an interesting situation may be encountered if the planar rotation symmetry is broken by an additional term in the hamiltonian , which favors specific evenly - spaced values of the angle @xmath3 , for @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting model is dubbed the @xmath5-state ( @xmath6 ) clock model . at low enough temperatures ,",
    "the phases get pinned at one of the favored discrete values @xmath7 , signaling the onset of true long range order .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath8 the thermal transition between ordered and disordered phases is separated by an intermediate phase with critical correlations@xcite . at zero temperature , quantum fluctuations take over .",
    "then , the ordered and disordered phases are directly connected by a quantum critical point.@xcite    the unique features of the xy and clock models in 2d are manifested in a broad and expanding set of distinct physical systems .",
    "the most familiar realizations of the 2d xy - model are associated with superfluidity and superconductivity in thin films , where several predictions were verified experimentally @xcite , and in closely analogous systems like melting of two dimensional crystals @xcite and dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "more recently , features of the kosterlitz - thouless transitions have been revealed in cold atoms experiments with bose - einstein condensates in two dimensions @xcite , including the observation of vortex proliferation in two - dimensional josephson arrays @xcite .",
    "realizations of the clock model were also discussed in a variety of contexts , for example , supersolid order of hard core bosons in triangular lattices was predicted in refs .  .",
    "this type of model provides a good description for some frustrated quantum magnet systems , where a two - step melting of the six - state clock order via an intermediate , critical phase was recently discussed @xcite .",
    "we further note that the physics of the clock model and the existence of an intermediate phase has an analogue in lattice gauge theories in higher dimensions @xcite , where the critical phase corresponds to quantum electrodynamics with massless photons .    in the present paper",
    "this rich critical behavior is studied in the framework of a concrete model of experimental relevance , namely , planar crystals of strongly interacting atoms , with a particular focus on realizations with trapped ions .",
    "ion coulomb crystals are an example of ordered states of matter which emerge from the competition between kinetic energy and repulsive forces in confined volumes @xcite .",

    "[ fig : structure],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the manifestation of statistical mechanics and field - theoretical models in ion crystal systems has already been discussed in the context of one - dimensional ion chains .",
    "for instance , the mechanical instability of a linear chain of ions to a zigzag structure can be classically mapped to a landau model @xcite , and the field theoretical model predicts a quantum phase transition of the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "careful numerical analysis based on dmrg - type of programs evaluated the quantum critical exponents with high precision and showed that the quantum critical region has a very small size because of the heavy ion mass @xcite .",
    "the transverse instability of planar lattices of ions , by contrast , is largely unexplored , and offers the possibility of observing much richer physics .",
    "these two - dimensional structures are presently analyzed as platforms for quantum information processing @xcite .",

    "similar results were obtained for a crystal of atoms interacting with repulsive dipolar interaction @xcite .",
    "features hinting to the formation of three planes were measured in trapped ions experiments , even though these could not be revealed by bragg scattering @xcite .",

    "intriguing properties are to be expected when fluctuations are taken into account . the buckling instability in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] can be described by a complex - valued order parameter ( @xmath12 ) , namely , the fourier transform of the height configuration , evaluated at the wave vector @xmath10 of the tripartite order .",

    "yet lower temperatures , the phase @xmath1 is expected to be pinned to one of six favored discrete values @xmath7 , leading to true long - range order and spontaneous breaking of @xmath13 symmetry . in this work we argue that the planar - to - buckled instability is captured by the six - state clock model @xcite .",
    "as already noted above , the six - state clock model predicts the existence of _ two _ transition lines at finite temperatures .",
    "this behavior follows from a duality relation between the fully ordered ( low-@xmath14 ) and fully disordered ( high-@xmath14 ) phases @xcite , dictating two distinct critical temperatures ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) at opposite sides of the self - dual point .",

    "@xcite the model is here in the universality class of the xy model in d=2 + 1 dimensions , up to dangerously irrelevant perturbations @xcite(for the formal definition see ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath14 finite but sufficiently small , we predict a crossover within the ordered phase from classical to quantum behavior at a temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this signifies the emergence of an additional characteristic scale for clock order , @xmath23 , which is intimately related to the clock term being dangerously irrelevant @xcite .",
    "as we show in this work , the realization of the quantum clock model in cold ion systems provides unique access to features that are typically inaccessible in standard condensed matter systems ( e.g. magnetic compounds ) . in standard condensed matter systems",
    "one usually measures global properties , such as susceptibilities and conductivities .",
    "by contrast , ionic traps and cold atomic systems allow for the measurement of local properties through direct imaging , and also offer continuous control of quantum parameters . in particular , a remarkable feature of the realization we propose in trapped ions is that the different phases separated by the buckling transitions are signaled by specific features of the bragg diffraction patterns , measurements which are typically accessible in these systems @xcite .",
    "the line - shape of the peaks , for example , provides a direct measurement of the @xmath14-dependent exponent @xmath0 characteristic of the quasi - ordered kosterlitz - thouless phase .",
    "in addition , we show that by analyzing the shape of the transition lines , the quantum critical properties can be probed significantly far from the quantum critical point .",
    "we further argue that these features can be observed in polarized dipolar gases @xcite , where the quantum critical behavior may be manifested more prominently .",

    "<S> crystals of repulsively interacting ions in planar traps form hexagonal lattices , which undergo a buckling instability towards a multi - layer structure as the transverse trap frequency is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> numerical and experimental results indicate that the new structure is composed of three planes , whose separation increases continuously from zero . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations by mapping this structural instability to the six - state clock model . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent implication of this mapping is that at finite temperature , fluctuations split the buckling instability into two thermal transitions , accompanied by the appearance of an intermediate critical phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is characterized by quasi - long - range order in the spatial tripartite pattern . </S>",
    "<S> it is manifested by broadened bragg peaks at new wave vectors , whose line - shape provides a direct measurement of the temperature dependent exponent @xmath0 characteristic of the power - law correlations in the critical phase . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum phase transition is found at the largest value of the critical transverse frequency : here the critical intermediate phase shrinks to zero . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , within the ordered phase , we predict a crossover from classical to quantum behavior , signifying the emergence of an additional characteristic scale for clock order . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss experimental realizations with trapped ions and polarized dipolar gases , and propose that within accessible technology , such experiments can provide a direct probe of the rich phase diagram of the quantum clock model , not easily observable in condensed matter analogues . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this works highlights the potential for ionic and dipolar systems to serve as simulators for complex models in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics . </S>"
