    "the interest in the electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces is growing due to the increasing ability to engineer interfaces between correlated materials and to accurately measure surface and bulk properties .",
    "a number of discrepancies have been reported between bulk and surface properties of complex materials@xcite , while interfaces between different materials can lead to surprising properties .",
    "a notable example is the metallic interface between the two insulators latio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0@xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the investigation of the effects of surfaces and interfaces has been focused on hubbard - type models , in which local repulsion correlates the electronic motion eventually leads , for commensurate densities , to a mott insulating state when the coulomb interaction is sufficiently large .",
    "these studies have either used extensions@xcite of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , a theoretical approach which has provided the first unified scenario of the mott transition , or variational approaches.@xcite studies of solid - vacuum interfaces have unveiled the possibility of surface ferromagnetism@xcite , and have described the penetration depth of a bulk metallic phase into an otherwise insulating surface.@xcite indeed , borghi _",
    "et al_.@xcite have shown the existence of a dead layer , due to an exponential penetration of metallic excitations .",
    "another localizing effect which affects the properties of electrons in solids is the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction .",
    "also in this case quantum fluctuations inherent to the low dimensionality of surfaces and interfaces and strong interactions can stabilize novel ground states that are distinct from the bulk . in ref.@xcite",
    "the freezing of a bulk phonon at the surface has been invoked as the source of remarkable electronic properties .    similarly to the case of repulsive electron - electron interactions , important insights into the problem of",
    "strongly coupled e - ph systems have been gained by dmft@xcite .",
    "studies of the holstein model in a homogeneous bulk system using dmft@xcite show that as the e - ph interaction increases , the conduction electrons progressively lose their mobility , eventually evolving into a polaronic state in which the presence of an electron is associated with a finite lattice distortion .",
    "the same e - ph coupling can cause any two polarons to attract and form a bound pair in real space , called a bipolaron . when the number of carriers equals the number of sites , i.e.",
    ", the lattice is half - filled , bipolaron formation causes the system to undergo a continuous ( at zero temperature ) metal to insulator transition at a critical e - ph coupling .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a solid - vacuum interface on this scenario in a previous paper , @xcite in which , in order to focus on the purely geometrical aspect of the problem we have considered the same parameters in the surface and in the bulk . even for uniform parameters ,",
    "the band narrowing at the surface@xcite causes a reduction in quasiparticle weight relative to the bulk , i.e. , the surface is less metallic .",
    "therefore , upon increasing the e - ph interaction strength the polaron crossover takes place first on the surface layer .",
    "nonetheless , for uniform model parameters , enhanced correlation effects at the surface are not sufficient to turn the surface insulating before the bulk ( i.e. , for a smaller e - ph coupling ) and a single metal - insulator transition occurs at the critical coupling for the infinite system @xmath1.@xcite    besides the geometrical effect of missing neighbors , the surface properties are complicated by the fact that the microscopic interactions close to the surface have a value which may differ significantly from that in the bulk . in the holstein model a modification of the hopping as well as of the e - ph coupling strength in the vicinity of the surface",
    "should be expected for any real systems .",
    "the relaxation of the interlayer distance , for example , can cause an enhancement or decrease in the hopping integrals at the surface . in this work",
    "we shall extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to nonuniform model parameters and investigate the possibility of the occurrence of a metallic surface concurrent with a bulk bipolaronic insulator or of a bipolaronic insulating surface concurrent with a normal metal in the bulk .",
    "we will consider the half - filled case , in which an actual phase transition can be observed , even if particle - hole symmetry forbids charge transfer between surface and bulk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian , which is a semi - infinite holstein model with layer dependent parameters . in addition",
    ", we briefly describe the embedding approach for dmft .",
    "results for a range of modified surface parameters are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize with some concluding remarks .",
    "we investigate the holstein model on a three - dimensional , bipartite simple - cubic ( sc ) lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping . the lattice is cut along a plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes , e.g. , the @xmath2-axis [ sc(001 ) surface ] .",
    "the system is considered to be built up by two - dimensional layers parallel to the surface .",
    "accordingly , the position vector to a particular site in the semi - infinite lattice is written as @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 stands for the coordinate origin in the layer @xmath5 and the layer index runs from @xmath6 for the topmost surface layer to infinity .",
    "@xmath7 is the position vector with respect to a layer - dependent origin , and runs over the sites within the layer .",
    "each lattice site is then labeled by indices @xmath8 and @xmath5 . in this notation ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , destruction ( creation ) operators for electrons with spin @xmath12 and local vibrons of frequency @xmath13 on site @xmath8 of the @xmath5 layer .",
    "the electron density on site @xmath14 is denoted @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the hopping matrix element between two nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath17 denotes the layer - dependent electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "we fix the energy scale by setting @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "to solve our model , we use an extension of dmft to inhomogeneous systems called the embedding approach for dmft.@xcite in this scheme , the layered structure is partitioned into a surface region which includes the first @xmath20 layers , and the adjacent semi - infinite bulk region ( substrate ) which is coupled to it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] ) .",
    "the surface corresponds to the region where one expects different properties relative to the bulk .",
    "it is shown next that the influence of the semi - infinite substrate on the surface region can be described in terms of an energy - dependent embedding potential .",
    "this can be viewed as an additional self - energy due to the transitions between the surface and the substrate .",
    "because of translational symmetry in the plane parallel to the interface , the embedding potential of the substrate is diagonal with respect to the two - dimensional wave vector @xmath21 and can be expressed as an @xmath22 matrix .",
    "( horizontal axis ) labels the layers parallel to surface .",
    "@xmath6 refers to topmost layer . in the embedding approach for dmft",
    "the system is divided into a surface region of @xmath20 layers and a semi - infinite substrate .",
    "the physical properties in the substrate ( e.g. , electron self - energy ) are not layer - dependent and coincide with those of the bulk . ]    by defining @xmath23 $ ] , the equation for the green s function is given by : @xmath24 while the surface region consists of only @xmath20 layers , the matrices corresponding to the green s function are infinite dimensional due to the semi - infinite substrate . in eq .",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) , is needed to calculate the embedding potential .",
    "@xmath46 is computable directly using a recursive relation.@xcite the self - energy appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) is obtained through a standard dmft calculation for the bulk crystal corresponding to the substrate .    after constructing the embedding potential of the substrate , @xmath47",
    ", we can compute the self - energy of the surface layers by dmft .",
    "this can be achieved via the following steps : ( i ) we associating an effective impurity model with each layer in the surface region , and solve them by using an impurity solver to find the layer - dependent local self - energies , @xmath48 .",
    "then we construct the surface region self - energy matrix which is diagonal in layer indices @xmath49 with the elements , @xmath50 , ( ii ) we calculate the on - site layer - dependent green s function via the following relation : @xmath51 where the @xmath22 @xmath29 matrix is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) .",
    "( iii ) we implement the dmft self - consistency relation for each layer , @xmath52^{-1}$ ] , which determines the bath parameters for the new effective impurity model .",
    "these steps have to be repeated until self - consistency is achieved .",
    "the embedding method requires that we consider a relatively small number of surface layers ; it is therefore a computationally less expensive extension of dmft in the presence of an interface compared to the slab method , in which the inhomogeneous system is simply represented as a finite number of layers . in this study ,",
    "the number of surface layers is chosen to be @xmath53 and we tested ( by varying this number ) that this number provides converged results .",
    "our impurity solver is exact diagonalization,@xcite where the bath is represented in terms of a finite number of levels , @xmath54 . for the case of phonon degrees of freedom we considered here",
    ", the infinite phonon space is also truncated allowing for a maximum number of excited phonons @xmath55 .",
    "the typical values we considered for the bath level are @xmath56 and typical maximum number of phonons are @xmath57 .",
    "we tested that those numbers provide essentially converged results .",
    "for example changing @xmath54 from @xmath58 to @xmath59 changes @xmath2 only by @xmath60 for @xmath61 which is close to the transition . for smaller @xmath62",
    "the error is smaller .",
    "we use the technique explained in the previous section to study the holstein model in a semi - infinite bipartite simple cubic lattice with in - plane translational symmetry and layer - dependent hamiltonian parameters .",
    "we will work at half - filling ( one electron per site ) , where any charge modulation is excluded by the particle - hole symmetry@xcite and local occupations on any layer , including the surface , coincide with the average filling , @xmath63 .",
    "we set the phonon frequency @xmath64 , which puts the system in the adiabatic regime . in order to characterize the metal - insulator transition",
    ", we use the quasiparticle weight , @xmath65^{-1}$ ] [ @xmath66 is the self - energy for layer @xmath5 ] whose vanishing marks the transition to the insulating state in which there is no spectral weight at the fermi level .",
    "another important quantity is the double occupancy , @xmath68 , which is large in bipolaronic states .",
    "we can model the inhomogeneity of the system and the different properties of the surface layer by introducing layer - dependent parameters .",
    "in particular , we can introduce different intralayer hopping @xmath69 or electron - phonon coupling @xmath70 at the surface or we can tune the hopping between the surface and the second layer @xmath71 .",
    "one immediately realizes that the actual behavior of the parameters at the surface will depend on the specific properties of each material and on the geometry of the interface . on the other hand",
    "the aim of this work is to understand general tendencies of an electron - phonon system in the presence of a surface .",
    "namely , we want to understand what happens when the surface is more metallic than the bulk and when the opposite situation is realized . therefore we will use one single parameter , @xmath72 , to model the effect of all the others .",
    "the case @xmath73 will represent all the situations in which the surface is less metallic than the bulk , while @xmath74 will represent the opposite situation of a more metallic surface .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the evolution of the layer - dependent quasiparticle weights , @xmath75 as a function of the ratio @xmath72 for an e - ph coupling slightly smaller than the bulk critical coupling for the bipolaronic metal - insulator transition , @xmath76 .",
    "+    we first focus on the regime in which the surface is less metallic than the bulk , i.e. , @xmath73 . we obviously find that the surface quasiparticle weight @xmath77 is smaller than that of the inner layers , although it does not vanish even for @xmath78 , even though the e - ph coupling is very close to the bulk critical coupling",
    ". the finite ( even if very small ) value of @xmath77 can be better identified by inspection of the self - energy which has to diverge to have a vanishing quasiparticle weight .",
    "it is seen from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that the surface self - energy @xmath79 goes up at low frequency and we expect extrapolation to zero as @xmath80 in a fermi liquid manner while a divergence is excluded .",
    "this behavior is not unexpected because a metallic bulk is indeed able to determine an exponentially damped quasiparticle weight in the neighboring layers including the surface layer .",
    "this rules out the possibility to observe a truly insulating surface on top of a metallic bulk , even if polaronic effects will be amplified on the surface.@xcite the double occupancy , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , presents a strong enhancement at the surface layer with respect to all the other layers and the bulk , as expected by the reduced hopping which favors the e - ph coupling .",
    "the second and third layers present only small deviations with respect to the bulk .",
    "we now consider the case of a surface which is more metallic than the bulk , either because the surface e - ph coupling is smaller or as we now analyze , @xmath81 .",
    "the results , also reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , show that , for very large @xmath69 @xmath77 approaches the free - electron value @xmath82 .",
    "this signals that the surface layer is essentially decoupled from the rest of the system and it supports an uncorrelated motion of the electrons .",
    "the rest of the system , however , remains strongly interacting and the @xmath83 layer represents the new surface layer , the @xmath84 layer becomes the first subsurface layer and so on . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , for all values of @xmath72 , the dependence of the quasiparticle weight in the subsurface layers on @xmath69 is comparatively weak and quickly diminishes with increasing distance from the surface .",
    "the behavior of the double occupancy confirms the decoupling of the topmost layer , which , for large values of @xmath72 , approaches the noninteracting value , @xmath85 .    for @xmath86 ,",
    "the same qualitative behavior is observed by changing the inter - layer surface hopping @xmath87 or by changing the e - ph coupling at the surface @xmath88 .",
    "dependence of quasiparticle weights @xmath75 of semi - infinite holstein model for simple cubic lattice in the ( 001 ) orientation for enhanced intra - layer surface hopping .",
    "surface transition at @xmath89 .",
    "bulk transition at @xmath90 . ]",
    "the decoupling between the surface and the bulk for large @xmath69 implies that one can in principle approach the situation where a metallic surface coexists with an insulating bulk . to investigate this possibility , we computed the quasiparticle weights as a function of @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we plot the quasiparticle weight vs. @xmath62 for a moderately enhanced surface hopping rate , @xmath91 . upon increasing @xmath62 two different critical interactions are found .",
    "the first one marks the transition from a metallic to a bipolaronic insulating state at @xmath1 , in which all the bulk quasiparticle weights ( all layers except the surface ) vanish . for larger e - ph interaction",
    "there is a range of values of @xmath62 in which the bulk is a bipolaronic insulator while the surface is still metallic with a finite @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , in this region some weight is induced in the subsurface layers .",
    "since the low energy surface excitations can not propagate into the bulk for @xmath92 and are instead reflected back to the surface for energies below the bulk excitation gap , the induced quasiparticle weight decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the surface .    at a second critical coupling , @xmath93",
    ", the surface also becomes insulating and bipolaronic . for @xmath94",
    "the entire system is in the bipolaronic insulating phase .",
    "a rather moderate enhancement of @xmath69 is sufficient to obtain a metallic surface phase .",
    "obviously , a larger @xmath69 means that electrons in the first layer are more itinerant .",
    "a smaller surface coordination number clearly counteracts this mechanism .",
    "consequently , we expect that a larger @xmath69 is needed to obtain a metallic surface state for more open surfaces , such as , for example , the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "the range of coupling @xmath62 where a metallic surface coexists with an insulating bulk quickly increases as @xmath69 is increased .",
    "for @xmath95 the bulk energy scales become irrelevant and the electronic structure of the surface layer decouples from the rest of the system .",
    "the overall results obtained here for a model with electron - phonon interactions are qualitatively similar to those of ref . for a repulsive hubbard model despite the fact that the nature of the transition is different in the two models . in both cases",
    "one can have an insulating surface coexisting with an insulating bulk , which is a mott insulator in the hubbard model and a bipolaronic insulator in the holstein model .",
    "instead , in both models a more insulating surface gives rise to a single metal - insulator transition .",
    "indeed the similarity between the two cases is not accidental . in the antiadiabatic limit",
    "the holstein model becomes the attractive hubbard model , which , at half - filling , can be mapped onto a repulsive model by a particle - hole transformation .",
    "then the mott transition of the repulsive model becomes a pairing transition in which fermionic pairs are formed,@xcite which in turn corresponds to the bipolaronic transition in the holstein model .",
    "therefore the main difference between the two models is the retarded nature of the electron - phonon interaction , as opposed to the instantaneous hubbard interaction . in principle in the electron - phonon case , larger lattice distortions at the surface@xcite could favor an insulating surface with respect to the case of the hubbard model .",
    "however our results show that the dynamical nature of the interaction is not able to introduce qualitative differences with respect to a purely electronic model .     +    to gain further insight about the region in which the surface remains metallic , we consider the behavior of the phonon displacement probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the ground - state wave function and @xmath98 is the projection operator on the subspace where the phonon displacement at a given site @xmath99 has value @xmath100 .",
    "this quantity is a measure of the distribution of the local distortions.@xcite in the absence of e - ph interaction , @xmath101 is a gaussian centered around @xmath102 .",
    "a small e - ph coupling slightly broadens the distribution which remains centered around @xmath102 , implying that the coupling is not sufficient to give rise to a finite polarization of the lattice .",
    "continuously increasing the interaction one eventually obtains a bimodal distribution with two maxima at @xmath103 .",
    "a bimodal pdf indicates that a certain number of the lattice sites are polarized by the presence of electrons in such a way that the average value of the polarization is greater than its fluctuations and therefore provide evidence for electron / phonon entanglement , i.e. , a polaronic state .",
    "the point at which the phonon pdf becomes bimodal is used as a marker of the polaron crossover,@xcite while @xmath104 can be used to characterize the transition to the bipolaronic insulator ( even if the vanishing of @xmath2 is a more rigorous criterion ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the phonon pdf for @xmath91 at two e - ph coupling values , one for @xmath86 ( top panel ) and one for @xmath105 ( lower panel ) . in the first case the system is metallic but polarons are already formed in all the layers except the topmost one , which has a larger hopping amplitude , @xmath69 .",
    "notice that the appearance of polaronic distortion is not sufficient to make the bulk insulating , confirming that the polaron crossover and the bipolaronic transition do not coincide . upon increasing the e - ph coupling and for @xmath105",
    ", the phonon pdf of all layers except the surface go to zero at @xmath102 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this confirms the insulating phase of these layers in this range of couplings while the surface layer shows a metallic state with polaronic character , as shown by the only slightly bimodal pdf .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a surface on a strongly coupled electron - phonon system .",
    "we described this system with a holstein model on a cubic lattice cut along one of the coordinate axes , assuming that the surface parameters are different from the bulk ones .",
    "we used the ratio between the hopping within the surface layer and the hopping within bulk layers , @xmath72 , to represent the effects of other nonuniform parameters and considered both situations in which the surface is less metallic than the bulk ( @xmath73 ) and the opposite regime of a more metallic surface .",
    "our focus is on the strong coupling regime , where we ask whether bulk and surface can be decoupled as far as the transport properties are concerned . in particular , for a given set of parameters , we ask whether one part of the system can be insulating while the other is metallic .",
    "we considered the system at half - filling , where the electron - phonon interaction can drive a bipolaronic phase transition .",
    "this choice inhibits charge transfer between the surface and the bulk .",
    "our investigation , based on the embedding method for dmft,@xcite shows that a metallic surface can coexist with an insulating bulk when @xmath106 already for moderate values of this ratio while the opposite behavior is not realized even when the surface hopping is vanishing .",
    "the bulk excitations are always able to penetrate in the surface layer , even if they are strongly damped .",
    "polaronic distortions , measured by the phonon distribution function , can be significantly different in the surface over a range of parameters .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", even if the most typical situation is that in which the surface is more insulating than the bulk , evidence for a ferromagnetic metallic surface has been reported in antiferromagnetic insulating manganites@xcite and a surface insulator - to - metal transition has been observed in insulating nis@xmath107.@xcite in general these measurements are difficult and rely on an interpretation of transport and magnetic measurements on samples with varying grain sizes.@xcite similarly , a use of photoemission and tunneling spectroscopies should be helpful to discern surface vs bulk properties .",
