    "the double layered manganite series la@xmath7sr@xmath8mn@xmath9o@xmath10 shows a rich and interesting , but somewhat poorly understood , phase diagram.@xcite it also appears to be a prospective candidate for future application by showing a large colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect.@xcite the interplay between spin , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom is of critical importance to many transitional - metal oxides with perovskite - related structures , and their delicate interactions have been intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the reduced dimensionality obtained by constraining the lattice degree of freedom in this bi - layered system facilitates the investigation of strong correlation between electron - lattice coupling and magnetic properties , proving it to be one of the most interesting cmr manganites .",
    "most studies focus on the mn@xmath11 rich portion of the la@xmath7sr@xmath8mn@xmath9o@xmath10 phase diagram , where the important cmr phenomenon and the temperature driven insulator - metal ( i m ) transition are observed.@xcite however , the phase diagram of the less studied mn@xmath12 rich region shows many novel and intriguing properties.@xcite for convenience , this is reproduced in fig .  [ fig;phasedi ] .",
    "for example , the type - a anti - ferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) phase is the ground state in a wide range @xmath13 while it is more commonly found in cubic manganites at the lowest sr@xmath14 dopings , though with some exceptions.@xcite also , a spin disordered `` gap '' region takes over for doping @xmath15 from 0.66 to 0.74 ; then a tetragonal to orthorhombic crystallographic phase transition occurs sharply at @xmath15=0.74 , followed by the type c / c@xmath3 afi phase up to 0.90 doping .",
    "there is also a wide charge ordered ( co ) region ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these observations challenge the simple goodenough - kanemori ( gk ) rules@xcite that successfully correlate the magnetic and structural properties of cubic perovskite manganites and are not well understood .",
    "an a - type afi phase , of ferromagnetic sheets antiferromagnetically coupled , at 50% doping can be explained within the framework of the gk rules if the mn 3@xmath17 orbitals are occupied by the @xmath18 electrons rather than the more commonly observed 3@xmath19 occupancy .",
    "however , to explain the c / c@xmath3 afi phase ( linear fm coupled chains that are antiferromagnetically coupled to their neighbors ) at high doping requires 3@xmath19 occupancy . because of the symmetry of these different orbitals the former , 3@xmath17 occupancy , will result in oblate ( two short and four long bonds ) and the latter , 3@xmath19 occupancy , in prolate ( two long , four short bonds ) jt - distorted octahedra .",
    "alignment of the long - bonds in the plane along the @xmath20-axis naturally explains the observed orthorhombic symmetry.@xcite in addition , a theoretical model based on the two @xmath18 orbitals by okamoto  @xcite also suggests the stabilization of 3@xmath17 and 3@xmath19 orbitals in type a and type c / c@xmath3 magnetic phases respectively .",
    "one outstanding question is the origin of the wide spin disordered region ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "because of the change in symmetry of the occupied orbitals a transition from a- to c / c@xmath3-type order must be first order . presumably in the spin disordered region a competition exists between these two magnetic orders that frustrates the system preventing magnetic long - range order from forming",
    ". it would be interesting to study the local spin correlations to verify this , but lack of single crystals has , thus far , prevented such studies .",
    "however , the local structure can be studied straightforwardly using the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of neutron powder diffraction data@xcite and the local magnetism can be inferred from this through application of the gk rules .    in the spin - disordered region",
    "the crystallographic structure is metrically tetragonal .",
    "this would be observed both if the _",
    "local _ structure is tetragonal and also if it is locally orthorhombic but the locally orthorhombic domains are disordered along the @xmath21 and @xmath20 directions . for example , this would occur if the long bonds of jt - distorted octahedra are randomly arranged along @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the pdf method could distinguish these two cases .",
    "similarly , if  and  ions are spatially disordered their presence will be more apparent from a local structural study.@xcite    we applied atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of neutron powder diffraction data to search for the presence of jt distorted mno@xmath1 octahedra in the doping range @xmath0 at low temperature .",
    "being a high resolution local structure probe , pdf technique has proved to be capable of resolving different levels of mno@xmath1 octahedra jt distortions in cubic perovskite manganites.@xcite the advantage of this technique is that both bragg and diffuse scattering intensities are used , reflecting both long and short range structural correlations .",
    "this enables us to study local structures contained in diffuse scattering found underneath and between the bragg peaks.@xcite    the results indicate a gradual change of the local structure with doping rather than an abrupt phase transition as seen in the average structure . local orthorhombicity is evident as early as @xmath22 where the average structure is clearly tetragonal .",
    "this supports the idea that the sample is inhomogeneous on the nano - scale with 3@xmath23 symmetry jt distorted  octahedra coexisting with undistorted  and octahedra .",
    "the number of jt distorted octahedra varies smoothly with doping .",
    "finely powdered samples of  ( @xmath24 , 0.60 , 0.64 , 0.66 , 0.68 , 0.70 , 0.72 , 0.76 , 0.78 , 0.80 ) were synthesized at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) .",
    "the synthesis method is described elsewhere.@xcite all samples were characterized using x - ray diffraction and susceptibility measurements . the oxygen content was verified by measuring the @xmath25axis parameter and was found to fall on the expected curve for stoichiometric samples .",
    "neutron powder diffraction measurements were carried out on the special environment powder diffractometer ( sepd ) at the intense pulsed neutron source ( ipns ) at anl .",
    "the samples of about @xmath26  g were sealed in cylindrical vanadium cans with helium exchange gas .",
    "data were collected at @xmath27  k for all the compounds using a closed cycle helium refrigerator . the @xmath28 and @xmath29 samples were measured four months after the others .",
    "standard corrections were made to the raw data to account for experimental effects such as detector dead time and efficiency , background , sample absorption , multiple scattering to obtain the normalized total scattering structure function , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the magnitude of the scattering vector .",
    "these procedures are described in detail elsewhere.@xcite all corrections were carried out using the program pdfgetn.@xcite the pdf , @xmath32 , is obtained by a fourier transformation according to .",
    "the pdf gives the probability of finding an atom at a distance @xmath33 away from another atom .",

    "[ fig;fqgr](a ) . superimposed on the pdf is a fit to the data of the average structure model using the profile fitting least - squares regression program , pdffit.@xcite the @xmath30 data were terminated at @xmath37   .",
    "this is a reasonable value for @xmath38 in typical pdf measurements on sepd .",
    "uncertainties at the level of @xmath39 are drawn as dashed lines on the difference curves .",
    "peaks in @xmath32 represent the probability of finding pairs of atoms separated by the distance-@xmath33 , weighted by the product of the corresponding atom pair s scattering lengths . in a perfect crystalline la@xmath7sr@xmath8mn@xmath9o@xmath10 structure ,",
    "the nearest neighbor distance comes from the 6 equidistant mn - o bond lengths in one mno@xmath1 octahedron , corresponding to the first peak in pdf at about 1.94  .",
    "this is negative due to mn atom s negative neutron scattering length .",
    "peaks at higher-@xmath33 generally contain contributions from more than one unresolved pair .",
    "the peak at 2.72   is dominated by high multiplicity o - o correlations , though it also contains a contribution from la / sr - o correlations .",
    "the decomposition of multiple contributions is handled by a real space rietveld refinement program : pdffit,@xcite with which a structural model can be obtained without the constraints posed by space group symmetries .",
    "therefore , both local structural and average structure analysis can be performed on the same data set .",
    "low-@xmath33 pdf peaks directly reflect the local structural details , and disorder in the local structure can cause excess peak broadening,@xcite extra shoulders@xcite and even split peaks.@xcite the prolate jt distorted octahedra of ions result in four short mn - o bonds in the range @xmath401.97     and two long bonds at 2.16  .@xcite in the cubic manganites , in the absence of disorder , these are easily resolved in the pdf.@xcite with doping the loss of orientational order of the orbitals quickly suppresses the coherent jt distortion and the average structure changes from orthorhombic to rhombohedral .",
    "however , the presence of fully jt distorted octahedra is evident in the local structure , though the peak in the pdf from the long - bonds is not resolved and is evident only as a broad shoulder.@xcite    we first investigated the pdfs from these layered , doped , manganites to search for qualitative evidence for the existence of long @xmath41    bonds .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig;expmod2 ] and  [ fig;expmod1 ] .     at 0.54 and 0.60 .",
    "while the model pdf shown as solid line is calculated assuming 46% prolate octahedra ( two long mn - o bonds at 2.16  , four short ones at 1.935  ) mixed with 54% normal octahedra ( 6 mn - o bonds at 1.935  ) . [ fig;expmod2],scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig;expmod2 ] shows the experimental pdfs at @xmath350.54 and 0.60 with a calculated pdf from a model assuming all mn@xmath11o@xmath1 octahedra are prolate . in this case the number of octahedra is determined from the doping and of these , two out of six mn - o bonds are set to 2.16   . the clear discrepancies between experiments and model rule out the existence of fully jt distorted prolate mno@xmath1 octahedra in the type a afi phase .",
    "as we discuss elsewhere , this is probably due to the fact that electrons are largely delocalized in the planes ( though not perpendicular to them ) in this region of the phase diagram at low - t,@xcite in analogy with the situation in the cmr region of the cubic manganites.@xcite    in the type c / c@xmath3 orthorhombic phase , we expect e@xmath5 electrons to stay in 3@xmath19 orbitals , and therefore the 2.16   long bonds are expect to be present . in this case the number of  sites , and therefore the number of long - bonds , is rather small .",
    "nonetheless , there is rather good agreement between the prediction of the simple model and the data in the region around @xmath41   .",
    "figure  [ fig;expmod1 ] shows the experimental pdfs at @xmath42 and 0.80 with the model - pdf . because of the small number of long bonds ( 6.7% at @xmath43 ) this result is not conclusive evidence supporting the existence of these long bonds , though the data are consistent with their presence .     at 0.78 and 0.80 . while the model pdf shown as solid line",
    "is calculated assuming 20% prolate octahedra ( 2 long mn - o bonds at 2.16  , 4 short ones at 1.935  ) mixed with 80% normal octahedra ( 6 mn - o bonds at 1.935  ) .",
    "[ fig;expmod1 ] , scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the pdf peaks represent the bond length _",
    "distributions _ in the material .",
    "the proposed mno@xmath1 octahedral shape change of the octahedra , from normal to prolate jt distorted with increasing doping , induces more local structural distortion and thus would cause the low-@xmath33 pdf peak to broaden .",
    "an increase in disorder in the local structure will result in this peak broadening , and therefore lowering , with doping as observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig;pkheight ] we show the change of the peak height , inversely related to the peak width , of the    . [ fig;pkheight],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    first pdf peak around 1.935    with doping .",
    "the @xmath28 and 0.68 samples lie above the others .",
    "these samples were measured at a later date and evidently the systematic errors have not been perfectly reproduced .",
    "note that the data were all collected at 4  k so no temperature broadening effects are expected .",
    "also , increasing the doping in this highly doped region moves the composition towards the pure stoichiometric end - member and so dopant ion induced disorder coming from the alloying is decreasing with increasing doping .",
    "the observation of an increase in disorder with increasing doping , in this peak that is highly sensitive to the mn - o bonds , is therefore strong evidence that an electronically driven change is occurring in the mn - o octahedral shape .    the smooth evolution of the peak heights ( fig .",
    "[ fig;pkheight ] ) suggests that the local structural changes occur continuously with changes of doping concentration @xmath15 , in contrast to what is observed in the average structure .",
    "the change in global symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic at @xmath44 is presumably related to a transition of the jt long - bonds from being randomly oriented to having a net orientation along @xmath20 .",
    "structural modelling gives a more quantitative picture of the local structure than the qualitative analysis described above .",
    "two structural models were fit based on the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystallographic models.@xcite it is worth noting here that any constraint by the space group and symmetry during average structure analysis can be relaxed in our real space full profile modelling . additionally , we can add any kind of constraints based on physical reasons .",
    "it was found that the best agreement was found for doping @xmath45 when the tetragonal symmetry is relaxed to orthorhombic . in the case of @xmath46",
    "the improvement in fit of the orthorhombic model is barely significant and in this case we can not unambiguously assign the local symmetry as orthorhombic . in the following , only results from the relaxed orthorhombic symmetry are reported .",
    "the two in - plane lattice constants @xmath21 and @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;latab ] together with the lattice constants obtained from rietveld refinement using gsas.@xcite the two dashed vertical lines show the phase transition from type - a afi to spin disordered and tetragonal to orthorhombic ( which is almost coincident with the magnetic transition from spin disordered to type c / c@xmath3 afi ) , respectively .     and",
    "@xmath20 from pdf refinements with orthorhombic models , while open circles are from rietveld refinements on the same data with tetragonal and orthorhombic models in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "vertical dotted lines indicate positions of magnetic phase transitions from type - a to spin disordered to type c / c@xmath3 .",
    "[ fig;latab],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the pdf refinements suggest the structure is already locally orthorhombic as early as @xmath22 , while the sharp crystallographic phase transition occurs around @xmath44 .",
    "this could be explained if jt distorted mno octahedra are beginning to appear on sites around @xmath46 , but the long bonds lie along the @xmath21 and @xmath20 axes randomly .",
    "it is important to determine whether the jt long - bonds that appear at @xmath49 lie in the plane , perpendicular to the plane , or are distributed between these possibilities .",
    "this can be studied by looking at the refined values of the mn - o bond lengths .",
    "the four different mn - o bond lengths within one mno@xmath1 octahedron , determined by pdffit , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;mnoblen ] .    .",
    "[ fig;mnoblen],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    what is clear from this figure is that over this doping range there is no clear trend in the apical ( perpendicular ) bonds .",
    "this implies that the observed increase in the mn - o bond - length distribution with doping is coming primarily from the in - plane bonds .",
    "the jt distorted  ions that appear with doping are predominantly locating their long - bonds in the plane .",
    "the electronic states along @xmath50 remain largely unchanged with doping , and little or no charge transfer occurs between in - plane and out of plane .",
    "we have observed evidence for jt long bonds lying in the plane from the pdf refinements .",
    "if this picture is correct we would expect to see a response in the refined in - plane mn and o displacement factors .",
    "these should be small for @xmath51 because there is little disorder in the structure and the models that we are using , based on the average structure , should work well also for the local structure .",
    "we might expect them also to be small and largely thermal in origin for @xmath52 where the jt distorted orbitals are ordered along the @xmath20 axis . in the spin disordered region",
    "we see evidence in the local structure for significant numbers of jt distorted  ions that are not fully ordered . by allowing the local structure to be orthorhombic much of this disorder",
    "will not show up in pdf derived displacement factors .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that there is a peak in the value of the planar mn - o displacement parameters in this region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;otherm ] .    .",
    "[ fig;otherm],scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "in a separate article we present the evidence supporting the fact that , at low temperature at @xmath24 , the @xmath18 electrons associated with  ions are delocalized in the plane . at this point",
    "there are no jt distorted mno octahedra and the local structure agrees with the average structure . when the c / c@xmath3-type antiferromagnetism appears around @xmath44 , coincident with a global orthorhombic distortion , it seems clear that jt distorted mno octahedra have appeared with the 3@xmath19 orbitals occupied .",
    "the main result from the current work is the observation that , in the local structure , the crossover between these two behaviors happens continuously with doping and is not abrupt as it is in the average structure .",
    "the structure is locally orthorhombic as early as @xmath46 suggesting the presence of jt distorted mno octahedra that are orientationally disordered within the plane . from this work",
    "we can not tell if this disorder is static or dynamic .",
    "this picture could qualitatively explain the spin - disordered region since , from the gk rules , local magnetic correlations will randomly fluctuate between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic from site to site .",
    "more detailed consideration of this model suggests that the sample is likely to be nano - phase segregated in this region since we believe the low - doping end - member ( the @xmath24 sample ) has its @xmath18 electrons delocalized in the plane.@xcite for this to make sense , delocalized clusters with locally a - type magnetic correlations must persist in this spin disordered region . since there is no evidence of macroscopic phase - separation these clusters are likely to be nano - scale .",
    "presumably they coexist with nanoscale regions of the sample where the @xmath18 electrons are localized as  ions with a local jt distortion . with increasing doping the number of these localized  sites first increases as the proportion of the sample in the localized state increases at the expense of the delocalized state .",
    "once the entire sample has transformed to the localized state , with increasing doping the number of  sites will decrease as ( @xmath53 ) in the normal way .",
    "this is apparent from the decreasing orthorhombicity that is evident for @xmath54.@xcite",
    "based on pdf results , we suggest that the local structure of  evolves smoothly as a function of doping at low temperature in the region of the phase diagram @xmath55 .",
    "the material evolves smoothly from being locally tetragonal at @xmath24 to having a well established orthorhombicity at @xmath34 .",
    "the local and global structures agree well at these end - points .",
    "however , in between , and associated with the spin disordered region of the phase diagram , the local structure appears orthorhombic even though the material is metrically tetragonal .",
    "these results can be reconciled if jt distorted mno octahedra exist with their long - bonds lying in the plane but disordered along the @xmath21 and @xmath20 axes .",
    "we have discussed that these results are consistent with the presence of inhomogeneities resulting in a coexistence of delocalized and localized electronic states , possibly due to nano - scale phase separation , in this intermediate region of the phase diagram , into regions that have the characteristics of the two end - members at @xmath24 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "we have argued that such a nano phase separation into disordered and possibly fluctuating a - type and c / c@xmath3-type magnetic domains may explain the frustrated magnetism in this region . making certain assumptions",
    "we have quantified the evolution of the phase separation with doping .",
