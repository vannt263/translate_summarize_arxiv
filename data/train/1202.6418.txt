    "the work of amari and others @xcite on the use of methods of riemannian geometry to analyze statistical estimation problems is of increasing interest to researchers in signal processing .",
    "this methodology , known as _ information geometry _ , provides a rigorous framework for measuring the power of data to discriminate values of parameters .",
    "these ideas date back to rao @xcite , who showed that the fisher information of a likelihood used in an estimation problem can be seen as a riemannian metric on the parameter manifold .",
    "this paper brings an information - geometric perspective to a class of sensor management problems by casting the objective of sensor management as parameter estimation and describing how this leads to the role of sensor management as selecting a riemannian metric for the parameter manifold .",
    "established results in riemannian geometry @xcite , outside the context of information geometry , show that the collection of all riemannian metrics on a riemannian manifold is itself an ( infinite - dimensional ) riemannian manifold . in problems where the collection of possible sensor actions is suitably modeled by a smooth finite - dimensional manifold , the space of interest is a finite - dimensional sub - manifold of this infinite - dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "a perspective is developed in which the best sensor management action to take , in terms of gathering the most information relevant to the estimation objective , is locally characterised in terms of geodesic curves in this space .    much of the development in subsequent sections of this paper is rather abstract and draws upon mathematical machinery that is unfamiliar to many researchers in sensor management area . to provide a more concrete context in which to illustrate some of the concepts that arise in later sections , is it helpful to begin by setting forth an example problem .",
    "suppose two mobile sensor platforms and one stationary target ( emitter ) are located in the plane @xmath0 , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the goal is to estimate the position of the target from bearings - only measurements taken at the sensors . since the sensors are mobile , the sensor management problem is to identify the trajectories of sensor motion that will yield the best estimate of the target position .     of a single stationary emitter from bearings - only measurements received at two mobile sensing platforms located at respective coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the plane .",
    "]    more specifically , the target position is @xmath3 and the sensor positions are @xmath4 for @xmath5 . denoting @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the bearing of the target from sensor @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the sensor measurements are independent and von mises distributed , each with common inverse dispersion parameter @xmath10 and with the circular mean of the measurement at sensor @xmath8 having circular mean @xmath11 .",
    "the following sections proceed to describe the nature of a sensor model from an information - geometric viewpoint , to define the parameter manifold , the sensor manifold , its metric structure , and to derive a differential equation that characterizes geodesic curves on the sensor manifold .",
    "the development departs from the purely geometric treatment in @xcite in that it allows for informative prior distributions on the parameter manifold rather than restricting attention to a volume form corresponding to the jeffreys prior .",
    "further , the riemannian metric with respect to which geodesics maximize `` energy integrals '' on the sensor manifold is shown to arise from both kullback - leibler and mutual information perspectives . throughout this process",
    ", the example just introduced will be used to illustrate these concepts in a concrete fashion .",
    "consider the problem of estimating a parameter @xmath12 from data @xmath13 collected by sensors up to time @xmath14 . beginning with a prior probability distribution for @xmath12 , which may reflect what is known from previous measurements or side information , the effect of taking measurement at time",
    "@xmath14 is to provide a posterior probability distribution , which will be assumed to be represented by a posterior probability density @xmath15 . if the option exists to use one of a parametrized set of sensors or sensor configurations , each of these will produce its own posterior density . when these posteriors are known , selecting a sensor configuration to use for a measurement amounts to choosing one of them from which to estimate @xmath12 .",

'' in the example problem , @xmath17 is @xmath0 because the parameter @xmath20 is a physical location in the @xmath21 plane .    denoting by @xmath22 the log - likelihood for this problem , the fisher information is @xmath23 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the derivative of @xmath25 with respect to the parameter @xmath12 .",

    "direct calculation in the example problem shows that , in the coordinate system described above and depicted in fig .  1 , @xmath28 has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    through this mechanism",
    ", the choice of a particular sensor leads to the association of a positive definite matrix with each @xmath32 , thereby imbuing @xmath17 with a _",
    "riemannian metric _ that measures the ability of that sensor s data , at least locally , to discriminate between parameter values .",
    "it is possible to calculate the shortest distance , in terms of this metric , between two values @xmath12 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the kullback - leibler divergence between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is approximately half of the square of the distance between @xmath12 and @xmath35 when @xmath12 and @xmath35 are close .",

    "specific assumptions guaranteeing finiteness of this integral are beyond the scope of this discussion , and it will suffice for the purposes here to assume directly that it is finite .",
    "although the nature of @xmath37 appears formidable , realistic sensor management problems do not require one to work with this entire space , rather with a finite - dimensional sub - manifold that inherits the metric from @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption that leads to this situation is that the collection of all possible sensor configurations is parametrized by a smooth manifold @xmath41 , which will be called the `` sensor manifold .

    "weaker assumptions are possible ( e.g. , @xmath49 is an immersion ) , but full generality is is not needed here to adequately illustrate the method . through the sensor geometry map , the finite - dimensional manifold @xmath41 inherits the riemannian structure of @xmath37 ; i.e. , the distance between two sensor configurations in @xmath51 and @xmath52 in @xmath41 is taken to be the distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath37 .",
    "this construction endows the sensor manifold @xmath41 with its own riemannian metric which captures , in information - theoretic terms , the `` complementariness '' of sensor configurations .     allows the finite - dimension manifold @xmath41 of sensor configurations to inherit a riemannian metric from the infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath37 of all riemannian metrics on the parameter manifold @xmath17 . ]",
