    "a _ compact wave _ is a robust solitary wave with a compact support , outside of which it vanishes identically .",
    "a _ compacton _ is to a compact wave what a soliton is to a solitary wave with an infinite support ; that is , a compacton is a compact wave that preserves its shape after colliding with another compact wave .",
    "rosenau and hyman ( 1993 ) introduced these concepts over a decade ago and a substantial number of differential equations supporting compact waves has since been identified and studied .    from the mathematical point of view , the emergence of such solutions is related to the degeneration of the differential equations of motion at certain points , and to the corresponding failure of the uniqueness theorem at these . indeed , compact waves are a patchwork made pasting together at degenerate points the different possible solutions ( unique in between degenerate points ) , hence patching together non - unique solutions ; it follows that they are not analytic solutions , and in this respect they are substantially different from standard soliton solutions .",
    "compact waves are weak solutions of differential equations , which are continuous  in contrast to shock waves  but have discontinuous derivatives , similarly to acceleration waves . a simple introduction to compact waves and to compactons",
    "can be found in a recent article by rosenau ( 2005 ) .",
    "the main objection facing compact waves is that the link between an _ adequate _ partial differential equation and a _ constitutive _ law is often tenuous .",
    "indeed , the generic affirmation that compact waves emerge from a balance between higher nonlinearity and nonlinear dispersion remains vague and esoteric if it is not supported by a clear and rigorous mechanical derivation of the _ right _ equations .",
    "destrade and saccomandi ( 2006@xmath0 , 2006@xmath1 ) recently proposed a general theory of dispersive nonlinear acoustics and showed how it is possible to derive exact equations governing the propagation of compact shear waves in solids with an inherent characteristic length . by applying standard asymptotic procedures to these exact equations ,",
    "it is then possible to justify evolutions equations which are similar to the compacton factory known as the @xmath2 _ kdv equation_.    from the mechanical point of view , these results were obtained by a careful modelling of the dispersive part of the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "the corresponding constitutive equations unify and explain in depth several theories of weakly _ nonlocal _ continuum mechanics , such as the @xmath3-lans theory of turbulence , or the rubin , rosenau , and gottlieb ( 2005 ) theory of inherent characteristic length .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the emergence of compact waves is investigated by a simple modification of weierstrass s theory ( a useful qualitative tool for single degree of freedom equations in classical mechanics ) .    in this note",
    "we show how another class of constitutive assumptions can generate the emergence of compact waves and even of _ semi - compact waves _ , which are travelling solitary waves with a semi - infinite support .",
    "one of the most elegant and powerful tools for the qualitative analysis of one - dimensional lagrangian conservative motions is _",
    "weierstrass s theory_. when an integral of energy ( in a generalized sense ) exists , weierstrass s theory allows us to understand whether the motion of our lagrangian system is periodic or non - periodic , simply by looking at the roots of the potential function .",
    "let us imagine that our natural lagrangian system can be described by a single holonomic parameter @xmath4 , say . furthermore",
    ", suppose that it is time - independent .",
    "the energy integral of such a system is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic energy , @xmath7 is minus the potential energy ( note the unconventional choice of sign ) , and the constant @xmath8 is determined by initial conditions .    recall that for natural lagrangian systems , the most general form of the kinetic energy is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a positive function of @xmath4 only ; also , @xmath11 only if @xmath12",
    ". we will thus assume ( [ p0 ] ) is in the form @xmath13    it follows that our motion is confined to those configurations where @xmath14 .",
    "the special configurations @xmath15 ( say ) where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are called _ barriers _ because they can not be crossed by the motion of @xmath18 : they split the range of possible values for @xmath4 into allowed and prohibited intervals .",
    "points with @xmath16 and @xmath19 are _ soft barriers _ and separate two allowed intervals ( see below ) .    solving first for @xmath20 , and then differentiating with respect to @xmath21 , we find in turn @xmath22 \\ . \\label{p3}\\ ] ] hence at a barrier @xmath23 which is a _ simple root _ of @xmath24 ( that is , such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , we have @xmath27 . such a barrier is called an _ inversion point _ , because the motion reverses its course after reaching it .",
    "we now separate the variables in @xmath28 and integrate to find @xmath29 } } \\text{d } q } \\ . \\label{integrate}\\ ] ] at a ( soft ) barrier which is a double root of @xmath30 ( that is , such that @xmath31 ) , the integral diverges .",
    "thus a soft barrier is also called an _ asymptotic point _ because it takes an infinite time to reach it .",
    "now we turn to wave propagation . consider the case of _ semi - linear wave equations _ in the unknown field @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant and @xmath35 a nonlinear function of @xmath36 .",
    "then for travelling waves of speed @xmath37 , i.e. for @xmath36 in the form @xmath38 we obtain the second order differential equation @xmath39 multiplying by @xmath40 and integrating , we find an equation of the same form as the first equation in , where @xmath41 is the constant @xmath42 and @xmath7 is the anti - derivative of @xmath35 ; note that @xmath8 is now related to the integration constant .",
    "weierstrass s theory tells us that a periodic wave corresponds to the existence of two consecutive inversion points ; that a pulse solitary wave with infinite tails corresponds to the existense of an asymptotic point followed by an inversion point ; and that a kink solitary wave with infinite tails corresponds to two consecutive asymptotic points ; see peyrard and dauxois ( 2004 ) or kichenassamy and olver ( 1992 ) for similar discussions .    consider the case of the following fully _ non - linear wave equations _",
    ", @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "the travelling wave reduction yields @xmath45 ' \\ = \\ f ( \\varphi ) \\ . \\label{p8}\\ ] ] here weierstrass discussion must be modified , sometimes to dramatic effect .",
    "take for instance the degenerate case @xmath46 .",
    "in that case , a first integral of is @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath8 is a constant of integration , and @xmath49",
    ".    we can still conduct an analysis _  la _ weierstrass , but we find that the fourth - order power above introduces some new features , not present in mechanical conservative lagrangian systems . indeed ,",
    "now the barriers @xmath50 are attainable not only when they are simple roots of @xmath24 , but also when they are double roots .",
    "this is the case because the analogue to is here @xmath51{\\dfrac{a}{2[u(\\varphi ) + e ] } } \\ \\text{d } \\varphi } \\ , \\label{integrate2}\\ ] ] and the integral converges for double roots .",
    "saccomandi ( 2004 ) gives a detailed discussion on this possibility and explains its consequences by the failure of the lipschitz condition , leading to a possible lack of uniqueness , and eventually to the possibility of compact waves ; see destrade and saccomandi ( 2006@xmath0 , 2006@xmath1 ) for examples .    in the present note",
    "we study yet another possibility for weierstrass s theory , touched upon by ferrari and moscatelli ( 1997 ) , rosenau ( 2000 ) , and gaeta , gramchev and walcher ( 2006 ) ; namely the case of barriers which are roots of _ non - integer order _ to the equation @xmath24 .    for a first glimpse at what may happen in this case , we consider in turn two examples with roots of fractionary order .",
    "example 1 . in the first example",
    ", we take @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 here we record two barriers : @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the integral in yields @xmath57",
    "clearly , both barriers can be reached in finite times : with our choice of the integration constant , these are @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 . from the acceleration",
    "is @xmath62 at @xmath56 the acceleration is not zero , and the motion reverses ; at @xmath55 however , the acceleration blows up !",
    "example 2 . in the second example",
    ", we take @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath63 here we record two barriers as well , again @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we perform the integral in for @xmath64 $ ] and solve it explicitly for @xmath4 as @xmath65 clearly again , the barriers are reached in finite times : @xmath55 at @xmath66 and @xmath56 at @xmath67 .",
    "we also find that the acceleration is given by @xmath68 making it clear that the barrier @xmath56 is a configuration associated with a finite force , whereas the barrier @xmath55 is associated with an equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , note that the right hand - side of does not satisfy the lipschitz condition at @xmath69 .",
    "this allows non - uniqueness of solution , and in fact we can patch together a compact solitary kink : this is equal to one for @xmath70 , then for @xmath71 it is accelerated to negative velocity and decreases to reach zero at time @xmath72 , and then stays there for @xmath73 ; see figure [ figure_kink ] .    .",
    "[ figure_kink],width=302,height=188 ]    these two examples highlight the complexity and the richness of the situations arising when considering non - integer barriers .",
    "let us now turn to a more general ( non - fractionary ) case .",
    "we take @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and thus @xmath7 , have a barrier @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "then by @xmath78 , the acceleration is @xmath79 we should consider several cases , depending on the value of @xmath80 .    if @xmath81 , then @xmath82 blows up at the barrier @xmath83 , similarly to the first example above . for this case",
    "we conclude that sublinear ( @xmath81 ) roots correspond to singular points which can not be reached in any way .",
    "if @xmath84 or @xmath85 , we recover the already discussed cases of simple and double roots .    if @xmath86 , the integral in diverges and the barrier at zero can not be reached in a finite time",
    "it is an asymptotic point .    if @xmath87 however , the integral is finite and the barrier zero is reached in a _ finite _ time . also , by , @xmath88 at that barrier , and we thus",
    "_ arrive at an equilibrium configuration with null velocity _",
    ", a situation which gives rise to a predicament : will the motion settle on this equilibrium configuration _ ad infinitum _ or will it reverse its course ?    in fact , the cauchy problem is ill - posed here , and the accompanying lack of uniqueness gives us some latitude to patch together compact waves ( similarly to the second example above ) or semi - compact waves , as is seen in the next section .",
    "destrade and saccomandi ( 2006@xmath0 , 2006@xmath1 ) show that the motion of transverse strain waves in nonlinear dispersive solids is governed by the following equation , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the direction of propagation , @xmath91 is the transverse strain , and @xmath92 is the mass density .",
    "the constitutive parameters are @xmath93 , the generalized _ shear modulus of nonlinear elasticity _ , and @xmath3 , the _ dispersion parameter _ of rosenau et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . for simplicity here , @xmath3 is taken constant and the strain wave is linearly polarized , travelling with speed @xmath37 , see .",
    "then @xmath94 and leads to @xmath95    next we write @xmath96 in the form @xmath97,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the ground state shear modulus , @xmath99 , and @xmath75 is an as yet arbitrary function . for bulk waves",
    ", @xmath37 is arbitrary and here we fix it at the sonic speed @xmath100 . then is exactly of the same form as .",
    "we are thus entitled to consider the possibility of barriers of non - integer order for the wave .",
    "for instance , take @xmath75 in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are constants .",
    "integrating with this choice gives @xmath105 then the following change of variable and rescaling of function @xmath106^\\frac{1}{2 } z , \\qquad \\omega ( \\xi ) \\equiv w([z(\\xi)]/\\sqrt{j_m},\\ ] ] give the following non - dimensional version of the governing equation , @xmath107    now we briefly discuss whether - constitutes a reasonable shear response for a nonlinear solid .",
    "we recall that the shear stress @xmath108 ( say ) necessary to maintain a solid in a static state of finite shear with amount of shear @xmath109 ( say ) is @xmath110 , given here by @xmath111.\\ ] ]    first we see that @xmath109 must not be allowed to go too far beyond @xmath112 for @xmath108 to remain positive . in practice , this means that for a given material we must fix @xmath113 beyond the maximal shear allowed before its rupture .",
    "note that the actual value of @xmath113 has no bearing on the existence and characteristics of the shear wave because it does not appear in .",
    "second we remark that the graph of @xmath114 and the graph of @xmath115 ( corresponding to a material with a linear shear response ) cross  independent of @xmath116  for @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath114 graph at @xmath117 and at @xmath119 are defined ( and equal to @xmath98 ) when @xmath120 ( of course these slopes are also defined at @xmath84 and @xmath121 , but we leave those special cases aside because they lead to simple and double roots in weierstrass s discussion , already treated above . )",
    "the slope of the @xmath114 plot at @xmath122 is always greater than @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the solid is strain - softening in shear , and that between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the solid is strain - hardening in shear .",
    "third we make sure that the shear response is a monotone increasing function of @xmath109 , by taking @xmath116 small enough so that the equation @xmath126 has no root in the @xmath127 $ ] interval .",
    "note that the actual value of @xmath116 does not affect the non - dimensional equation of motion .",
    "having checked that the shear response is sound , we may now look for solutions to the non - dimensional equation describing solitary wave solutions to the original equation ; these are homoclinic or heteroclinic solution to .    owing to , the barrier @xmath129 is necessarily an asymptotic point .",
    "taking @xmath130 also creates an asymptotic point barrier @xmath131 , leading to a solitary kink with tails of infinite extend .",
    "however , taking @xmath132 gives a barrier reachable in a finite time .",
    "the result is a _ semi - compact wave _ , coming from value 1 at @xmath133 and decreasing to zero , which it reaches in a finite time with zero speed and zero acceleration .",
    "it may then remain at this value zero . for figure [ figure_semi_kink ]",
    "we took the case @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and chose @xmath136 to fix the value of the integration constant ."
