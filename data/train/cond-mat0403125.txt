    "its existence has attracted the attention of researchers from various branches of the natural sciences for many years . as for physical systems ,",
    "@xmath4 noise has been observed as fluctuations in the currents of diodes , vacuum tubes and transistors , the resistance of carbon microphones , metallic thin films and semiconductors  @xcite , the magnetization in spin glasses  @xcite and in many other systems .    despite a substantial amount of experimental and theoretical effort , a unique underlying mechanism for",
    "the flicker noise remains unknown and still poses an open question as to its universal origins  @xcite .",
    "however , there is now increasing evidence that the non - trivial exponent , at least in electronic systems , may come from equilibrium dynamics in the presence of disorder  @xcite when energy barriers exceed the typical thermal energy .",
    "@xmath6 noise in charge density wave ( cdw ) systems  @xcite has been studied mainly in nbse@xmath7 and tas@xmath7 materials @xcite .",
    "the first experiment was done on a bulk nbse@xmath7 sample by richard _",
    "@xcite who found @xmath8 .",
    "studying transport properties of the quasi - one - dimensional cdw material tas@xmath7 at low temperatures , zaitsev ",
    "zotov  @xcite observed that slightly above the depinning threshold of the driving electric field , the exponent @xmath9 for the current noise is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that a phenomenological model based on fluctuations in impurity pinning force due to deformations of the sliding condensate was proposed to explain the broad band @xmath4 noise in cdw systems @xcite .",
    "however , neither theoretical nor numerical estimation of @xmath9 has been provided so far .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute @xmath9 from _ first principles _ with the help of a one - dimensional classical model for cdws  @xcite .",
    "the current was obtained through numerical simulation of the overdamped equation of motion .",
    "the @xmath4 scaling is evaluated using the so - called _ wavelet transform modulus maxima _ ( wtmm ) method  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 was found to depend on @xmath11 . at low temperatures ( @xmath12 ) , in agreement with the experiments  @xcite , we obtain @xmath10 in the crossover regime .",
    "exponent @xmath9 drops with increasing @xmath11 and the `` exact '' @xmath4-noise is observed at @xmath13 where @xmath9 becomes 1 .",
    "this interesting result is indicative of the possible occurrence of @xmath4 noise . at high temperatures @xmath9 takes on the white noise value 0 .",
    "notably , the observed @xmath14 is not related to the second order depinning transition behavior at @xmath15 . due to the asymptotic uniqueness of the sliding state @xcite",
    ", this critical point dynamics scenario leads to the ` trivial ' exponent @xmath16  @xcite . additionally , the observed ` flicker ' noise behavior @xmath17 gains on its scaling range with increased distance to the critical point of the second order depinning transition .",
    "based on unusual current  voltage characteristics  @xcite , zaitsev - zotov suggested that at low temperatures the quantum creep dynamics may play an important role and proposed the crossover from classical to quantum creep regime as an alternative explanation for experimental results .",
    "the strength of the quantum fluctuations in 1d cdw systems can be estimated by a dimensionless parameter @xmath18  @xcite which is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective band mass .",
    "this quantity is of the order @xmath21 to @xmath22  @xcite , indicating irrelevance ( to 1/f noise ) of quantum effects at low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , our simulation results on transport properties  @xcite also suggest , in comparison to experiments , that quantum fluctuations do not have any visible effect with respect to the strength of the driving forces under consideration ( see also discussion in  @xcite ) . on the other hand , due to the small parameter @xmath18",
    "the core action of phase slips in the bulk is large ( @xmath23 )  @xcite and hence the probability of phase slips which are proportional to @xmath24 becomes small .",
    "it decreases even more under a renormalization group transformation , such that we can neglect phase slips in our simulations .",
    "therefore we will use the one - dimensional classical model without phase slips to study the current noise in cdw systems .",
    "the charge  density @xmath25 of an 1d cdw can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the wave vector of the undistorted wave , @xmath28 the fermi wave vector and @xmath29 a slowly varying phase variable .",
    "@xmath30 is the mean electron density and @xmath31 is proportional to the amplitude of the complex order parameter  @xcite .",

    "the effect of disorder on the dynamical behavior of the one - dimensional charge density wave model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) at low temperatures was studied  @xcite with the help of the discretized version of equation ( [ langevin ] ) and it was found that , contrary to high dimensional systems  @xcite , the dependency of the creep velocity on the electric field is described by an analytic function .",
    "the current noise spectrum was not , however , explored .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the typical time evolution of @xmath58 for @xmath69 @xcite ( upper panel ) and @xmath61 ( lower panel ) at temperature @xmath62 .",

    "the spike structure is also seen , but less pronounced compared to the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the patterns for the two values of @xmath37 look similar .",
    "zaitsev  zotov studied  @xcite the current noise spectrum for applied electric fields with averaged driving current @xmath72pa . using fig . 1 from ref .",
    "@xcite one can see that the threshold electric field in these experiments is @xmath73v / cm and the averaged currents of @xmath74pa and @xmath75na at @xmath76k correspond to electric fields @xmath77v / cm and @xmath78v / cm , respectively , i.e. the electric fields used are greater than the threshold field .",
    "therefore we will restrict our spectrum analysis to @xmath79 .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of non - stationary behavior of the cdw current as in our simulations , the standard fourier transformation is not suitable for determining the exponent @xmath9 and one should , therefore , employ more sophisticated methods .",
    "we have chosen the wtmm method  @xcite for its superior properties in non - parametric scaling exponent estimation  @xcite in the presence of polynomial non - stationarities .",
    "in particular , attempts to reduce the non - stationary behavior of the current by discarding an initial time interval ( as in  [ fig1 ] ) can not generally guarantee reaching a steady state , since the relaxation time to a steady state can be very long ( see the remark in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the ability of the wavelet transform to provide unbiased scaling estimates of non - stationary signals is due to the property of orthogonality to polynomials up to the degree @xmath80 of the base functions , of the so - called analyzing wavelets @xmath81 with @xmath82 ` vanishing moments ' : @xmath83 the transform is defined as the inner product of the function @xmath84 and the dilated and translated wavelet @xmath85 :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the continuous version ( cwt ) , which among other properties ensures local blindness to the polynomial bias .",
    "indeed , the wavelet transform decomposes the signal into scale ( and thus frequency ) dependent components ( scale and position localized wavelets ) , comparable to frequency localized sines and cosines based fourier decomposition , but with added position localization .",
    "this localization in both space and frequency , together with the wavelet s orthogonality to polynomial bias , makes it possible to access even weak scaling behavior of singularities @xmath89 , otherwise masked by the stronger polynomial components : @xmath90 where function @xmath1 is represented through its taylor expansion around @xmath91 .    in the generic multifractal formulation of the wtmm formalism",
    "@xcite , the moments  @xmath92 of the measure distributed on the wtmm tree are taken to obtain the dependency of the scaling function @xmath93 on the moments  @xmath92 :    @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the partition function of the @xmath92-th moment of the measure distributed over the wavelet transform maxima at the scale @xmath96 considered :    @xmath97    with @xmath98 as the set of maxima @xmath99 at the scale @xmath96 of the continuous wavelet transform @xmath100 of the function @xmath101 , in our case the cdw current ; @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , scaling analysis with wtmm is capable of revealing the modal exponent @xmath103 for which the spectrum reaches maximum value ; this @xmath103 corresponds to the hurst exponent @xmath104 in the case of monofractal noise .",
    "this exponent is directly linked to the power spectrum exponent of the ( stationary ) fluctuations of the analyzed signal by : @xmath105 , the relation which links the spectral exponent @xmath9 with the hurst exponent @xmath104 .",
    "for the cdw current @xmath58 averaged over @xmath106 disorder realizations and for three values of the external electric field : @xmath107 , 0.3 and 0.35 which are higher than @xmath108 .",
    "the dotted straight lines denote the reference slope corresponding to @xmath109 .",
    "the dashed line has the slope @xmath110 , which corresponds to the flat power spectrum of white noise @xmath111 .",
    "right : the same but for @xmath112 .",
    "the dotted lines denote the reference slope @xmath113 corresponding to @xmath114 .",
    "again , the dashed line corresponds to white noise . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_mf_c ] , the modal scaling exponent has been obtained by a linear fit over an appropriate scaling range from a suitably defined , weighted measure @xmath115 on the wtmm : @xmath116 with @xmath117    and for three electric field values @xmath37=0.25 , 0.3 and 0.35 , and for the number of the disorder averaging ensemble fixed to @xmath106 .",
    "consistent with the experimental findings @xcite , the flicker noise region becomes narrower with decreasing @xmath37 .",
    "more importantly , we obtain @xmath10 as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "asymptotic transition to the scaling regime characteristic to uncorrelated behavior ( white noise , i.e. , @xmath111 ) can be clearly identified for all the values of @xmath37 shown ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_mf_c ] ) .",

    "our fitting gives @xmath120 , which is important from the point of view of the exact definition of @xmath4-noise . in fig .",
    "[ h_t ] , we provide the dependence of the exponent @xmath9 on temperature . note the convergence towards @xmath121 as the temperature ( and the averaged current ) approaches 0 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 decays quickly with temperature and we have the uncorrelated noise value @xmath122 at high @xmath11 .",
    "the primary question remaining is that of the origins of @xmath4 noise in the cdw system . in our opinion",
    ", the disorder causes the rugged energy landscape ( similar to the spin glass case ) leading to a wide spectrum of relaxation times .",
    "the average over such a spectrum would give rise to the flicker noise  @xcite .",
    "our results shown in fig .",
    "[ h_t ] support this point of view .",
    "namely , at low temperatures the roughness of the energy landscape becomes more important and consequently the flicker - like regime occurs .",
    "another qualitative scenario  @xcite for the appearance of the flicker noise in our system is that the cdw may be viewed as a single particle in a quasi - periodic potential with troughs of variable depths .",
    "such a simplified model closely resembles the `` many - pendula '' model of the self - organized criticality  @xcite in which the @xmath4 noise should occur .     on temperature .",

    "in conclusion , using the classical one - dimensional cdw model and multifractal analysis , we have reproduced the experimental results on the current noise spectrum .",
    "our simulations support the existence of @xmath4-noise in this system . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first evidence of @xmath4 scaling obtained from first principle based simulation in a physical ( i.e. cdw ) system",
    ".    it would be interesting to check if a three - dimensional version of our model gives @xmath124 obtained for the bulk nbse@xmath7 sample @xcite or if other models should be implemented to reproduce this experimental result .",
