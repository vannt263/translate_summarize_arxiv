    "in recent years the old kaluza - klein idea of a world with additional dimensions got a strong impact from attempts motivated by string theory to resolve the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "especially fruitful is the idea of implementing warped manifolds , for which the metric of the four - dimensional space - time can depend on the additional dimensions .",
    "the most popular models using warped geometries are the randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite in which our observable universe is treated as a four - dimensional brane embedded into a five - dimensional anti - de  sitter ( ads ) bulk space .",
    "the particular properties of the ads geometry allow to describe the trapping of the gravitational zero - mode on the four - dimensional brane @xcite . displacing the second four - dimensional brane in the bulk",
    ", one can propose a resolution to the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "however , warped two - brane models have some important additional features .",
    "the most interesting effect is the existence of _ light _ massive graviton modes , which have already attracted a lot of attention in the context of higher - spin theories and in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing development is the construction of semi - realistic braneworld models in which the kaluza - klein gravitons ( kk gravitons ) can have an extremely low mass and can be responsible for the mediation of all @xcite or a large part of the gravitational interaction @xcite . in these setups ,",
    "the veltman - van - dam - zakharov discontinuity ( vvdz discontinuity ) @xcite ( for a recent analysis of vvdz discontinuity at the classical level see @xcite ) is either unobservable due to the setup @xcite or cured by non - linear effects @xcite , though it is still under dispute if these models exhibit a realistic behavior in the limit of strong gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "an effect so far overlooked is the mixing between graviton modes of different masses which inevitably occurs in higher - dimensional spacetime models .",
    "this effect is of little relevance in models with small extra dimensions and heavy kk modes , because in these models the massive gravitons will rarely be produced and therefore are of no astrophysical significance . in models where gravitons can have masses in the sub - ev scale like in the rs models ,",
    "the mixing between the different modes can lead to interesting effects in gravitational - wave astrophysics .",
    "gravitational waves ( gw s ) will then consist of contributions from several graviton modes .",
    "this will induce a beat in the gravitational wave which could be detectable with gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "the parameters of the oscillations will crucially depend on the size of the extra dimension  commonly parameterized by the radion - field ",
    ", thus suggesting the notion of radion - induced graviton oscillations ( rigo s ) .",
    "this effect was investigated in @xcite and will be discussed in full detail in the present paper .",
    "rigo s are particularly interesting because their observability is not limited to a certain minimal value of the extra - dimensional curvature scale .",
    "rigo s could therefore become the first detectable signature of m - theory phenomenology . from the very beginning , the affinity of the rs two - brane setup to the m - theory compactification of @xcite",
    "( see @xcite for reviews of effective five - dimensional m - theory ) was noticed @xcite .",
    "actually , the rs two - brane model can be viewed as a simplified version of this m - theory solution which appears five - dimensional in an intermediate energy - range .",
    "the rs model simplifies the effective supergravity action of @xcite to an einstein - hilbert action and neglects the gauge - field part of the m - theory effective action . due to this relationship",
    ", the rs model has been used as an approximation for aspects of m - theory cosmology where a full - fledged m - theory calculation is not feasible ( see @xcite for an example ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rs model deviates in major aspects from the requirements of m - theory : first , in contrast to the rs model , m - theory restricts the size of the largest extra dimension to typically @xmath0 @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility to detect the extra dimension by measuring short - distance deviations from newtonian gravity .",
    "second , in m - theory the requirements of having the standard - model group structure and supersymmetry breaking forces one to identify our universe with the positive - tension brane ( cf .",
    "this prevents one from obtaining the simple geometrical solution to the hierarchy problem by locating our universe on the negative tension brane of the rs model .",
    "therefore it seems that one has to choose between either the attractive phenomenology of the rs model or the appealing theoretical framework of m - theory , although it remains tempting to conjecture that if m - theory realizes large extra - dimensions in nature they should exhibit a similar setup as the randall - sundrum two - brane model .",
    "considering rigo s one may , however , be able to probe several additional orders of smallness of the extra - dimensional curvature radius if only the radion acquires suitable values .",
    "although the required values of the radion are still far from the parameter range of typical m - theory models , the search for rigo s thus offers a possibility to narrow down the gap between the phenomenologically accessible parameter space of large extra dimensions and the predictions of m - theory .    in our preceding paper @xcite",
    "we have studied the four - dimensional effective action in the rs two - brane model .",
    "this action is a functional of the two induced metrics and radion fields on the two four - dimensional branes . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we shall here extend the study of radion - induced graviton oscillations in the two - brane world of @xcite and investigate their phenomenological consequences .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the rs setup and describe the corresponding nonlocal braneworld effective action and the equations of motion in terms of a nonlocal kernel and green function , respectively . in sec .",

    "a strongly oscillating wave has to be generated by a source of 14 orders of magnitude stronger than that of a weakly oscillating one in order to be of the same magnitude , which at first sight makes the detection of rigo s impossible .",

    "this is connected with the fact that  in contrast to the mixing for neutrinos or kaons , where only the mass matrix is non - diagonal if written in terms of observable states  in the case of gravity in a two - brane world the whole kernel of the action is non - diagonal and , moreover , is diagonalizable only on - shell ( cf",

    "however , these considerations rely heavily on the assumed amount of dark matter in the universe . in view of the fact that the cosmology of braneworld models is still in its infancy and can provide us with quite surprising models of dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we resist from using such constraints which would lead us to an upper mass for the first kk mode close to the bounds on the graviton mass given by the particle data group , @xmath296 @xcite .",
    "however , even the less restrictive solar - system limit ( [ bigram ] ) on @xmath297 renders rigo s in bi - gravity models unobservable . inserting ( [ bigram ] ) into the formula for the oscillation length ( [ long - length ] ) , we find even for gw s of a frequency of @xmath298hz , the lowest frequency observable by lisa , an oscillation length of more than 300 light years .",
    "an amplitude modulation of that length will clearly remain undetectable .",
    "the limit on the wavelength of the first kk mode does however still allow for the possibility of detecting ultralight kk modes by studying the propagation speed of gravitational waves with lisa ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the bounds on the length of rigo s from solar - system dynamics , it is interesting to note that some models even predict a minimal oscillation length beyond the present - day hubble radius of our universe .",

    "therefore , the vvdz discontinuity is absent @xcite .    in this model , the strongest constraint on",
    "the length of rigo s comes from the requirement that the observable cosmological constant of our universe , i.e.   the effective cosmological constant @xmath301 of one of the ads@xmath299 branes , should be compatible with the observed magnitude of the cosmological constant , @xmath302 where @xmath303 denotes the four - dimensional planck mass .",
    "this requirement on the geometry of the model is reflected in the coefficients of the harmonics of the bulk spacetime and thereby restricts the mass of the first kk - mode @xmath297 to a fraction of the inverse size of the hubble radius of our universe , @xmath304 using the expression for the lower limit of the oscillation lenght ( [ short - length ] ) , the value for the first kk mass leads to an oscillation length for rigo s , @xmath305 which is much larger than the size of the horizon of our universe and thus renders rigo s unobservable _ in principle _ in this particular model .",
    "we have studied the phenomenon of radion induced graviton oscillations in the two - brane world .",
    "first , we have established a method to extract the particle content from the nonlocal braneworld effective action of @xcite for the randall - sundrum two - brane model .",
    "this method is easily extendable to arbitrary two - brane models and provides the missing link between nonlocal braneworld actions , which are specifically suited for the treatment of cosmological problems @xcite , and spectral representations of the effective action particularly suited to particle - phenomenology considerations @xcite .    from the equations of motion for the graviton sector ,",
    "we have found a mixing of massless and massive modes which depends parametrically on the radion .",
    "this mixing leads to the effect of radion induced graviton oscillations which is in principle observable .",
    "rigo s are a feature of every higher - dimensional spacetime model , since there will always occur amplitude modulations in gw s which are a mixture of a massless mode and kk modes .",
    "however , in traditional models with flat extra dimensions , the mass of the first kk mode is so big that it will neither be produced by astrophysical sources nor lead to oscillation lengths of macroscopic size .",
    "in contrast to this , warped geometries allow kk mode masses which are so low that they can lead to oscillations of detectable length .",
    "in particular , waves from sources on the hidden brane show strong oscillations on the visible brane .",
    "the amplitudes of these waves are strongly suppressed by the warped geometry and thus , at first sight , seem to remain undetectable . however , by using simple m - theory motivated scaling arguments , we have demonstrated that one should expect a network of cosmic strings on the hidden brane which would produce a background of high amplitude gravitational waves .",
    "the m - theory scaling properties considered may easily compensate the geometrical damping of gw s from the hidden brane .",
    "therefore gw s with rigo s stemming from the hidden brane may actually become a relevant effect for gravitational - wave astronomy . the characteristic pattern of rigo s may even help to discriminate between noise and the stochastic gw background in gw interferometers .    at first sight",
    "another natural candidate for observable rigo s are bi - gravity models . in these models the massless graviton and the lightest massive one are coupled to matter with nearly equal strength and , thus , produce strong oscillations .",
    "unfortunately , bi - gravity models which exhibit rigo s of experimentally detectable oscillation - length are already ruled out by precision measurements of newton s law on solar - system scales .",
    "the effects connected with the mixing and oscillations of quantum states in a multidimensional spacetime have received some attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "neutrino mixing and oscillations were reconsidered in @xcite , while the mixing between quarks and an attempt to explain the origin of cp violation was described in @xcite . nevertheless , to our knowledge ,",
