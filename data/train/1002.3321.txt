    "electromagnetic propagation through metamaterials has stimulated , in the last decade , an intense research activity with two main purposes : the identification of artificial structures exhibiting anomalous values of the permittivity @xmath2 and the permeability @xmath3 @xcite and the investigation of the electromagnetic phenomenology resulting from the unusual electromagnetic properties .",
    "leading examples of the novel class of phenomena supported by metamaterials are superlensing @xcite , optical cloaking @xcite and photonic circuits @xcite .",
    "recently , a good deal of attention has been devoted to the investigation of metamaterials characterized by a very small dielectric permittivity ( @xmath2-near - zero materials ) since they host an electromagnetic regime where the magnetic field displays static features @xcite and the tunneling of electromagnetic energy through sub - wavelength channels has been proposed @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "metamaterials exhibiting remarkable nonlinear properties have been investigated as well @xcite and various soliton manifestations @xcite have been considered .",
    "the investigation of metamaterial nonlinear properties is particularly important in that it can lead to overcoming one of the fundamental limit of nonlinear optics , the fact that most of the optical materials have a relatively weak nonlinear response .",
    "the main idea is that the local electromagnetic fields of the inclusions in the metamaterial can be much larger than the average value of the field thus producing an enhancement of the nonlinear response @xcite .",
    "the problem of achieving a substantial enhancement of the nonlinear response has also been considered within the more general subject of composite structures homogenization @xcite , and the strategy is always that of conceiving a microscopic inhomogeneous structure concentrating the field within the nonlinear constituents .",
    "the full exploitation of the nonlinear response is possible only if the nonlinear polarization is not a small perturbation to the linear part of the electric displacement field and generally this is achieved through nonlinearity enhancement or by means of resonant processes or photorefractive processes where the large nonlinearities come at the cost of a large time response . however , as shown in this paper , the interplay between the linear part of the electric displacement field and the nonlinear polarization can be made efficient even by following the opposite route , i.e. by reducing the linear polarization .",
    "we therefore devise a nonlinear medium with a very small linear dielectric constant since it is a natural setting for the observation of the electromagnetic regime where the nonlinear response does not play the role of a mere perturbation .",
    "in this paper we consider a periodic layered composite whose slabs are filled either with linear media with arbitrary permittivity and permeability or by standard isotropic focusing or defocusing kerr media . exploiting a suitable extension of the well known technique generally used for describing the homogenization of linear layered composites ,",
    "we show that the homogenized medium is characterized by effective constitutive relations formally coinciding with those of a standard kerr medium .",
    "we note that the parameters characterizing such an effective response can be simply tailored through a suitable choice of the composite underlying constituents and that , due the large freedom in choosing both constituent media and their volume filling fraction , the design of linear and nonlinear properties can be independently performed .",
    "therefore our composite medium allows a full and efficient engineering of the kerr nonlinear response .",
    "more interestingly , we prove that the effective response parameters span very wide ranges encompassing values not available in standard media .",
    "the standard isotropic kerr response ( in the the frequency domain ) generally depends on two parameters usually denoted with @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite in term of which we define @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the available values of @xmath8 belong to the range @xmath9 ( depending on the actual mechanism supporting the kerr response ) . in this paper",
    "we prove that the parameter @xmath8 appearing in the effective kerr nonlinear response can , in principle , assume any value ( encompassing negative and very large values ) and we discuss the impact of the exotic values of @xmath8 on the electromagnetic phenomenology .    confining our attention to transverse magnetic ( tm ) fields ,",
    "we show that it is possible to design a nonlinear kerr medium whose linear dielectric permittivity is much smaller than one and therefore able to host the electromagnetic regime where nonlinearity can not be regarded as a perturbation ( extreme nonlinear regime ) . as a first general electromagnetic effect characteristic of the extreme nonlinear regime , we discuss the transverse power flow reversing , i.e. the fact that , for an electromagnetic beam , the poynting vector on the beam propagation axis can be antiparallel to poynting vector on the beam lateral sides @xcite . within the extreme nonlinear regime , the full exploitation of the nonlinear response can be achieved and , in order to discuss the consequent novel electromagnetic phenomenology , we consider a class of nonlinear guided waves admitting full analytical treatment . a number of the obtained nonlinear guided waves exhibit , as expected , transverse power flow reversing .",
    "we prove that , in the situation where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( or in the equivalent case @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) these waves are allowed to propagate through the medium if @xmath16 , in striking contrast to the fact that , in a linear medium with the same permittivity and permeability , any wave would be evanescent .",
    "this is possible since nonlinearity overcomes the linear contribution to the electric displacement field producing an effective nonlinear dielectric permittivity able to support propagating waves .",
    "in addition we identify a mechanism which , combining the extreme nonlinear regime with the properties of the effective medium response with @xmath17 , produces an hyper - focusing of the considered nonlinear guided waves . in the situation @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath15 ( or in the equivalent case @xmath10 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 ) the nonlinear guided waves exist in the wider range @xmath18 and @xmath19 thus allowing to probe the kerr nonlinear response for large values of @xmath20 .",
    "since the phase difference between the components of the considered waves is @xmath21 , we predict that , for @xmath22 , an extreme compensation occurs ( within the effective nonlinear polarization ) and supports a field whose transverse @xmath23 and longitudinal @xmath24 components are such that @xmath25 , i.e they share the same profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we investigate the homogenization of a one - dimensional periodic layered medium comprising both linear ( metamaterials ) and nonlinear ( kerr media ) slabs and we derive the constitutive relations characterizing the effective medium . in sec.iii",
    "we focus on the transverse magnetic field configuration and we discuss the effective nonlinear response engineering and the allowed extreme nonlinear regime , together with the transverse power flow reversing effect . in sec.iv we investigate a class of nonlinear guided waves belonging to the extreme nonlinear regime and we discuss a number of their peculiar properties .",
    "the existence of the considered nonlinear guided waves is investigated in appendix a.",
    "consider a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( whose time dependence is @xmath26 ) propagating through a metamaterial layered medium consisting of periodically repeating , along the @xmath27axis , @xmath28 layers of different media of thicknesses @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , so that the structure spatial period is @xmath31 ( see fig.1 where the case @xmath32 is depicted ) . each one of these @xmath28 media can be either a linear metameterial with arbitrary dielectric and magnetic properties or a cubic standard nonlinear medium so that , the electromagnetic response of the @xmath33th medium is modelled by the general constitutive relations @xmath34 , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\bf b}_j & = & \\mu_0 \\mu_j { \\bf h}_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability constants , whereas @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the complex amplitude of the local electromagnetic field vectors , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the relative permittivity and permeability of the @xmath33th layer , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the standard parameters characterizing the isotropic cubic nonlinear response of the @xmath33th layer @xcite . evidently , @xmath45 if the @xmath33th layer is filled by a linear medium and @xmath46 for a nonlinear dielectric .",
    "the linear dielectric constants @xmath41 are here regarded as arbitrary complex numbers since the layers can be filled with lossy and active media . if the field vacuum wavelength is much greater than the spatial period ( @xmath47 ) the considered periodically nonlinear stratified medium can be homogenized , i.e. its electromagnetic response can be shown to coincide with that of a suitable homogeneous medium . in order to obtain the overall effective response , note that any component of the local electromagnetic field can be assumed , within each layer , independent on @xmath48 since the layers are extremely small ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "although this is a very reasonable physical assumption , it can be rigorously proven exploiting the well known powerful two - scale expansion method @xcite .",
    "each of the physical observable ( macroscopic ) electromagnetic field vectors , say @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , is obtained by averaging ( along the @xmath27 axis ) the layer local fields over the period @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volume filling fraction of the @xmath33th medium ( @xmath55 ) and the averaging has been performed by exploiting the uniformity along @xmath48 of the local fields @xmath56 . within each unit cell",
    "( of thickness @xmath52 ) , at each plane interface between the @xmath33th and @xmath57th layer , the local fields have to satisfy the electromagnetic boundary conditions ( continuity of the tangential component of electric and magnetic fields and continuity of the normal components of the displacement and magnetic induction fields ) so that the local fields are joined by the relations @xmath58 where @xmath59 . averaging the local fields",

    "is concerned , exploiting the first of eqs.([micr ] ) together with the fact that @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( obtained by combining the electric boundary conditions of eqs.([boundary ] ) and eq.([average ] ) ) we obtain @xmath71   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\epsilon_0 \\left [ \\langle \\chi_j |e_{jy}|^2 \\rangle { \\bf e}_\\perp + \\langle \\chi_j \\gamma_j e_{jy}^2 \\rangle { \\bf e}_\\perp^ * \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ d_y & = & \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_j e_{jy }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\epsilon_0 \\chi_j \\left [ ( { \\bf e}_\\perp \\cdot { \\bf e}_\\perp^ * ) e_{jy } + \\gamma_j ( { \\bf e}_\\perp \\cdot { \\bf e}_\\perp ) e_{jy}^ * \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\epsilon_0 \\chi_j \\left [ ( 1+\\gamma_j ) |e_{jy}|^2 e_{jy }   \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the transverse parts of the macroscopic displacement and electric fields , respectively and @xmath74 is the @xmath27component of the macroscopic displacement field . note that in the second of eqs.([dd ] ) no averaging has been performed . as a consequence of the layers nonlinear dielectric behavior , the first of eqs.([dd ] ) contains terms where the squares of @xmath75 is suitably averaged . in order to derive the effective medium response",
    ", the second of eqs.([dd ] ) has to be solved to express @xmath75 ( @xmath30 ) as a function of the macroscopic fields @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "this can be pertubatively done by noting that , since we are considering the standard kerr effect for each nonlinear layer @xcite , the terms containing @xmath43 are much smaller than the term @xmath77 so that , up to the first order in the field cubic terms , from the second of eqs.([dd ] ) we obtain @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\         & - & \\chi_j \\frac{1+\\gamma_j}{\\epsilon_0 ^ 2 \\epsilon_j^4 } |d_y|^2 d_y.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] averaging eq.([ee ] ) we obtain a relation joining the macroscopic field @xmath79 and the fields @xmath80 and @xmath74 so that this relation , if its nonlinear contributions are much smaller than the leading linear term , can be inverted to perturbatively yield @xmath74 as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath79 . therefore ,",

    "the obtained dielectric response shows that the effective medium behaves like an anisotropic kerr medium whose nonlinear properties can be tailored by suitably choosing the underlying layered composite .",
    "note that , in the specific case of linear layers ( i.e. @xmath84 for all @xmath85 ) , eqs . ( [ dy ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) yield @xmath86 where the relative dielectric permittivity @xmath87 is the diagonal tensor @xmath88 $ ] , reproducing a well known result concerning homogenization of linear layered media @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic propagation through the homogenized medium of sec.ii is described by the macroscopic maxwell equations @xmath89 and the constitutive relations of eqs.([bbb ] ) , ( [ dy ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we focus on transverse magnetic ( tm ) electromagnetic fields ( see fig.1 ) of the form @xmath90 for which the constitutive relations become @xmath91 , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\bf b } & = & \\mu_0 \\mu { \\bf h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92^{-1 } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we note , from eqs.([parameters ] ) , that the permittivity @xmath2 and the permeability @xmath3 are the weighted and harmonic weighted means , respectively , so that the former is bounded by the minimum and maximum of its microscopic values whereas the latter is unbounded since some @xmath42 can be negative .",
    "it is worth stressing that the averaging of the microscopic linear parameters additionally allows an efficient loss management since , combining lossy and gain media , one can design an effective medium whose effective parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 have negligible imaginary parts @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath93 is the weighted mean of the constituents nonlinear kerr coefficients and this is in agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath8 is generally not the weighted mean of its microscopic values since some @xmath43 can be negative ( corresponding to defocusing nonlinear layers ) , so that @xmath8 can assume any positive and negative value .",
    "this result is particularly interesting since , for standard cubic isotropic materials , there is , in general , a small number of available @xmath8 ( depending on the physical mechanism supporting the nonlinear response @xcite ) whereas , for composite materials , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath8 can span the whole range @xmath9 .",
    "even though eqs.([tmconst ] ) formally coincides with the standard isotropic kerr response , the considered layered material can support a nonlinear electromagnetic phenomenology very different from that observed in a standard kerr medium , as discussed in the following three subsections .",
    "consider a layered medium for which @xmath2 is such that @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the effective nonlinear coefficient @xmath93 is of the same order of magnitude of underlying coefficients @xmath43 ( i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "an effective dielectric permittivity with a very small real part and a negligible imaginary part can be achieved by combining positive and negative standard dielectric layers ( @xmath97 ) together with gain media ( generally unavoidable since absorption due to negative dielectrics can not be in principle neglected @xcite ) . for the sake of simplicity let us consider the case @xmath98 .",
    "if the electromagnetic field propagating through the medium is such that @xmath99 so that , in the first of eqs.([micr ] ) , the nonlinear part is much smaller than the linear contribution @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the nonlinear layers are in the presence of a field whose intensity is sufficiently small for their response to be purely cubic and , as a consequence , the microscopic responses of eqs.([micr ] ) hold and the macroscopic constitutive relation in the first of eqs.([tmconst ] ) , holds as well . on the other hand , combining eq.([extr ] ) and the first of eq.([tmconst ] ) we conclude that , as opposed to what happens in standard nonlinear materials , the considered layered medium is able to support the extreme nonlinear regime where the electromagnetic field is such that the linear contribution @xmath101 and the nonlinear term @xmath102 in the overall dielectric response have the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is evident that the same argument , with some slight changes , allows to prove that the extreme nonlinear regime is observable for any value of @xmath8 .",
    "even though the advantages of such an extreme nonlinear regime are self - evident , it is worth to compare it to the standard paraxial nonlinear optical situation where the overall refractive index is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the background linear refractive index and @xmath105 is the kerr nonlinear term ( where @xmath106 is the optical intensity ) . in this situation",
    "the field satisfies the equation @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and , within the paraxial regime , the field is of the form @xmath109 . at this point",
    "one chooses @xmath110 since , substituting the paraxial field into eq.([helmo ] ) the term @xmath111 ( responsible for the fast spatial variation of the field ) is removed and the paraxial equation @xmath112 is readily obtained by neglecting the term containing @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , in standard paraxial nonlinear optics , @xmath114 can play an important role in eq.([helmo ] ) since the large linear contribution proportional to @xmath115 is suppressed by the presence of the carrier plane wave .",
    "in other words , the nonlinear kerr contribution @xmath116 is not requested to compete against the whole linear part @xmath117 of the dielectric response . as opposed , in the case of the extreme nonlinear regime discussed in this section , this competition can happen and therefore the nonlinearity is not confined to solely drive the slowly varying amplitude @xmath118 .",
    "the extreme nonlinear regime can support propagation of beams characterized by exotic properties such as the reversing of the electromagnetic power flow along the beam transverse profile @xcite . in order to discuss this phenomenon , consider a tm field describing a beam mainly propagating along the @xmath119-axis , i.e. a field of the form @xmath120 with the requirement @xmath121 ( @xmath122 being a wave - vector depending on the actual electromagnetic configuration ) . in this case",
    "maxwell equations of eqs.([maxwell ] ) yield @xmath123 where it has been assumed that @xmath124 and @xmath125 . exploiting eqs.([hy ] ) , the @xmath119-component of the time averaged poynting vector @xmath126 can be expressed through the equivalent relations @xmath127.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if , for example , @xmath128 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath129 , for an electromagnetic beam whose peak electric field strength is greater than @xmath130 ( extreme nonlinear regime ) , it is evident from the first of eqs.([tmconst ] ) that @xmath131 and @xmath23 are antiparallel around the propagation axis ( i.e. where @xmath132 ) and parallel elsewhere so that , from the first of eqs.([sz ] ) , @xmath133 is negative near the beam axis and positive elsewhere .",
    "in other words the beam is characterized by a power flow whose direction reverses its sign along the transverse profile and this is due to sign flipping of @xmath131 along the wave transverse profile while @xmath23 does not change its sign .",
    "note that the sign flipping of @xmath131 corresponds to a sign flipping of @xmath134 ( see the first of eqs.([hy ] ) ) so that , considering the second of eqs.([hy ] ) , this can happen without sign flipping of @xmath23 only if @xmath135 is not negligible with respect @xmath136 .",
    "therefore power flow reversing can take place only if the field has a transverse size comparable with @xmath137 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the discussed power flow reversing is very different from the effect that , in left handed metamaterials , the poynting vector is antiparallel to the carrier wave vector which is a consequence of the fact that , in such media , @xmath138 and @xmath14 ( with @xmath139 ) . on the other hand , in our case ,",
    "@xmath140 and the sign of the power flow is not uniform being controlled by the field intensity through the nonlinearity .      in order to discuss the impact of the wide ranges of the parameters of eqs.([parameters ] ) , made possible by linear and nonlinear design , on electromagnetic phenomenology , we consider the situation where the effective dielectric permittivity @xmath2 and magnetic permeability @xmath3 are real , so that , after substituting the expression for the tm field of eqs.([tmfield ] ) into eqs.([maxwell ] ) , eliminating the magnetic field and using eqs.([tmconst ] ) we get @xmath141 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial ^2 u_x}{\\partial \\xi \\partial \\zeta } - \\frac{\\partial ^2 u_z}{\\partial \\xi^2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sigma_\\epsilon \\sigma_\\mu u_z   + \\sigma_\\mu \\left [ ( 1+\\gamma ) |u_z|^2 u_z +   \\left ( u_z u_x^ * + \\gamma u_z^ * u_x \\right ) u_x \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dimensionless variables and fields have been introduced according to @xmath142 and @xmath143 whereas @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the signs of the products @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively . as opposed to the linear regime where electric field behavior solely depends on the sign of @xmath148 @xcite , from eqs.([system ] ) we note that , in the present approach , the nonlinear dynamics separately depends on the signs of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , i.e. the presence of the nonlinearity breaks the symmetry between the roles played by the signs of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . from eqs.([dimension ] ) we note that @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath93 scale the actual physical size and amplitude of the field so that , since the effective parameters can in principle be independently chosen ( see eqs.([parameters ] ) ) , for each solution of eqs.([system ] ) , a suitable layered medium can be designed in such a way that the actual electromagnetic field has prescribed geometrical size and intensity ( see eqs.([dimension ] ) ) . as an example , in the case of beam propagation , such an electromagnetic scaling freedom can allow to observe nonparaxial feature of a beam whose transverse width is much greater than the vacuum wavelength ( if @xmath149 ) or , on the contrary , to observe the standard paraxial phenomenology for beams whose transverse width is much smaller than the vacuum wavelength ( if @xmath150 ) and , remarkably , this can be done by avoiding any unfeasible requirement on the intensity .",

    "if , on the other hand , the phase difference between @xmath164 and @xmath165 is @xmath21 , the overall nonlinear response of eqs.([nonli ] ) solely contains the terms @xmath167 and @xmath168 , so that , if @xmath163 ( for realistic bounded fields ) the compensation @xmath169 has to occur in order to prevent the divergence of the term proportional to @xmath8 in eqs.([system ] ) .",
    "as explained in the above section , the nonlinear response of the proposed kerr metamaterial is easy to manage and , since the accesible ranges of its parameters are very wide , one can devise situations where the medium supports a genuinely novel nonlinear electrodynamical phenomenology . in order to probe the novel regime , we consider here a class of fields which are sufficiently simple to admit full analitical treatment and , at the same time , rigged with enough structure to show many of the novel effects .",

    "in fig.6 we report different nonlinear guided waves profiles together with their power flows for different values of @xmath272 and for @xmath273 .",
    "let us consider , in this case , the behavior of the nonlinear guided waves for large values of @xmath20 . from panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.6",

    "even though the profiles of eqs.([asympt ] ) are not physical , they show that both @xmath248 and @xmath289 asymptotically approaches the square of an electromagnetic dark solitons and they provide a very good description of the above mentioned saturation for @xmath290 .",
    "the profiles of @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath285 and @xmath286 together with the asymptotical profiles of eqs.([asympt ] ) are plotted in fig.(7 ) from which it is evident that , for @xmath291 , the asymptotical profiles of eqs.([asympt ] ) accurately describe the actual field profiles ( apart a small region around @xmath239 for @xmath173 ) . we conclude that , in the extreme nonlinear regime , the compensation between @xmath292 and @xmath271 and the linear terms , if @xmath163 , forces @xmath248 and @xmath289 almost to coincide .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effective response of a nonlinear kerr metamaterial obtained by homogenizing a one dimensional layered periodic structure .",
    "the effective response formally coincides with that of a standard nonlinear kerr medium with the important difference that its parameters ( both linear and nonlinear ) can be independently designed and that they can assume even values not achievable in standard material . as a consequence we can choose the linear dielectric permittivity to be much smaller than one thus allowing the observation of the regime where the nonlinear polarization can not be regarded as a small perturbation ( extreme nonlinear regime ) . as a leading general phenomenon characterizing the extreme nonlinear regime",
    "we have discussed the transverse power flow reversing effect , i.e. the fact that the power flow can change its sign along the transverse beam profile . combining the extreme nonlinear regime and",
    "the fact the effective kerr response can be tailored in an unconventional way , we have discussed a number of novel phenomena exploiting a class of fields ( nonlinear guided waves ) admitting full analytical description .",
    "examples of such novel effects are the fact that the nonlinear waves can propagate even if the medium linear properties ( dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability ) would forbid propagation , hyper - focusing induced by the phase difference between the field components ( in the case @xmath293 ) and extreme compensation between the field components if they are @xmath21 out of phase in the limiting situation @xmath294 .",
    "in order to derive the existence conditions of nonlinear waves satisfying eqs.([syste ] ) and eqs.([boundary1 ] ) , it is convenient to cast eqs.([syste ] ) into the standard form of a first order system of differential equations .",
