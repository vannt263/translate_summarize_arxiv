    "our aim in physics is not only to calculate some observable and get a correct number but mainly to understand a physical picture responsible for the given phenomenon .",
    "it very often happens that a theory formulated in terms of fundamental degrees of freedom can not answer such a question since it becomes overcomplicated at the related scale .",
    "thus a main task in this case is to select those degrees of freedom which are indeed essential .",
    "for instance , the fundamental degrees of freedom in crystals are ions in the lattice , electrons and the electromagnetic field . nevertheless , in order to understand electric conductivity , heat capacity , etc .",
    "we instead work with `` heavy electrons '' with dynamical mass , phonons and their interaction . in this case",
    "a complicated electromagnetic interaction of the electrons with the ions in the lattice is `` hidden '' in the dynamical mass of the electron and the interactions among ions in the lattice are eventually responsible for the collective excitations of the lattice - phonons , which are goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken translational invariance in the lattice of ions . as a result ,",
    "the theory becomes rather simple - only the electron and phonon degrees of freedom and their interactions are essential for all the properties of crystals mentioned above .",
    "quite a similar situation takes place in qcd .",
    "one hopes that sooner or later one can solve the full nonquenched qcd on the lattice and get the correct nucleon and pion mass in terms of underlying degrees of freedom : current quarks and gluon fields .",
    "however , qcd at the scale of 1 gev becomes too complicated , and hence it is rather difficult to say in this case what kind of physics , inherent in qcd , is relevant to the nucleon mass and its low - energy properties . in this lecture",
    "i will try to answer this question .",
    "i will show that it is the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which is the most important qcd phenomenon in this case , and that beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks which interact by the exchange of goldstone bosons ( pseudoscaler mesons ) and are subject to confinement .",
    "it is well known that at low temperature and density the approximate @xmath0 chiral symmetry of qcd is realized in the hidden nambu - goldstone mode .",
    "the hidden mode of chiral symmetry is revealed by the existence of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons .",
    "the @xmath1 ( the @xmath2-singlet ) decouples from the original nonet because of the @xmath3 anomaly @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd is that the valence quarks acquire their dynamical or constituent mass @xcite through their interactions with the collective excitations of the qcd vacuum - the quark - antiquark excitations and the instantons .",
    "we have recently suggested @xcite that beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry a baryon should be considered as a system of three constituent quarks with an effective quark - quark interaction that is formed by a central confining part and a chiral interaction mediated by the octet of pseudoscalar mesons between the constituent quarks .",
    "the simplest representation of the most important component of the interaction of the constituent quarks mediated by the octet of pseudoscalar bosons in the @xmath4 invariant limit is    @xmath5    here @xmath6 represents the flavor @xmath2 gell - mann matrices and the sums run over the constituent quarks .    because of the flavor dependent factor @xmath7 the chiral boson exchange interaction ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "will lead to orderings of the positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectra , which agree with the observed ones in all sectors . for the spectrum of the nucleon and @xmath8 the strength of the chiral interaction between the constituent quarks is sufficient to shift the lowest positive parity states in the @xmath9=2 band ( the @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) below the negative parity states in the @xmath9=1 band ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . in the spectrum of the @xmath14 , on the other hand",
    ", it is the negative parity flavor singlet states ( @xmath15 ) that remain the lowest lying resonances , again in agreement with experiment .",
    "the mass splittings between the baryons with different strangeness , and between the @xmath14 and the @xmath16 which have identical flavor , spin and flavor - spin symmetries arise from the explicit breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry that is caused by the mass splitting of the pseudoscalar meson octet , and the different masses of the u , d and the s quarks .",
    "this lecture has the following structure .",
    "section 2 contains the proof why the commonly used perturbative gluon exchange interaction between the constituent quarks leads to incorrect ordering of positive and negative parity states in the spectra . in section 3",
    "we outline the importance of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry for low - energy qcd , and in section 4 we present a short historical sketch of the role of chiral symmetry in quark based models .",
    "section 5 contains a description of the chiral boson exchange interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) . in section 6",
    "we describe the spectra of the nucleon , the @xmath8 resonance and the @xmath14 hyperon as they are predicted by the @xmath4 symmetric interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 breaking in the interaction is considered in section 7 .",
    "section 8 is devoted to an `` exact '' three - body description of baryons where the interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) is taken into account to all orders . in section 9",
    "we discuss the role of the exchange current corrections to the baryon magnetic moments that are associated with the pseudoscalar exchange interaction .",
    "finally , in section 10 some recent lattice - qcd results are discussed .",
    "it was accepted by many people ( but not by all ) that the fine splittings in the baryon spectrum ( in analogy to atomic physics they are often called `` hyperfine splittings '' as they arise from the spin - spin forces ) are due to the gluon - exchange interaction between the constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "now i shall address myself to a formal consideration why the one gluon exchange interaction can not be relevant to the baryon spectrum .",
    "the most important component of the one gluon exchange interaction @xcite is the so called color - magnetic interaction    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are color @xmath2 matrices .",
    "it is the permutational color - spin symmetry of the 3q state which is mostly responsible for the contribution of the interaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the corresponding two - body matrix element is    @xmath19_{\\rm c}\\times [ f_{ij}]_{\\rm s}:[f_{ij}]_{\\rm cs}|\\vec \\lambda^{\\rm c}_i \\cdot \\vec \\lambda_j^{\\rm c } \\vec\\sigma_i \\cdot \\vec \\sigma_j|[f_{ij}]_{\\rm c } \\times [ f_{ij}]_{\\rm s}:[f_{ij}]_{\\rm cs}>\\ ] ] @xmath20_{\\rm c},[11]_{\\rm s}:[2]_{\\rm cs } \\\\",
    "-{8\\over 3 } & [ 11]_{\\rm c},[2]_{\\rm s}:[11]_{\\rm cs}\\end{array}\\right .. \\label{2.2}\\ ] ]    thus the symmetrical color - spin pairs ( i.e. with a @xmath21_{\\rm cs}$ ] young pattern ) experience an attractive contribution while the antisymmetrical ones ( @xmath22_{\\rm cs}$ ] ) experience a repulsive contribution .",
    "hence the color - magnetic contribution to the @xmath8 state ( @xmath23_{\\rm cs}$ ] ) is more repulsive than to the nucleon ( @xmath24_{\\rm cs}$ ] ) and the @xmath8 becomes heavier than the nucleon .",
    "the price is that @xmath25 should be larger than unity , which is bad .",
    "in addition there is no empirical indication in the spectrum for a large spin - orbit component of the gluon - exchange interaction @xcite implied by this big value of @xmath26 .",
    "the crucial point is that the interaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) feels only colour and spin of the interacting quarks .",
    "thus the structure of the @xmath27 and @xmath14 spectra has to be the same as these baryons differ only by their flavour structure .",
    "if one looks at the particle data group tables , however , one immediately sees a different ordering of the positive and negative parity states in both spectra . in the @xmath27 spectrum",
    "the lowest states are @xmath28 ; @xmath29 ; @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 , while in the @xmath14 spectrum the ordering is as follows : @xmath33 ; @xmath34 @xmath31 @xmath35 ; @xmath36 . a weak flavor dependence via the quark masses in ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    "can not explain this paradox .",
    "the interaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) can not explain why the two - quantum excitations of positive parity @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 lie below the one - quantum excitations of negative parity @xmath39 @xmath31 @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for instance , the positive parity state @xmath10 and the negative parity ones @xmath39 @xmath31 @xmath40 have the same mixed ( @xmath24_{\\rm cs}$ ] ) color - spin symmetry thus the color - magnetic contribution to these states can not be very different ( a small difference is only due to the different radial structure of the positive and negative parity states ) . but",
    "the @xmath10 state belongs to the @xmath44 shell , while the @xmath45 pair is a member of the @xmath46 band , which means that the @xmath10 should lie approximately @xmath47 above the @xmath45 . in the @xmath8 spectrum",
    "the situation is even more dramatic .",
    "the @xmath11 positive parity state has a completely antisymmetric cs - young pattern ( @xmath23_{\\rm cs}$ ] ) , while the negative parity states @xmath48 have a mixed one .",
    "thus the color - magnetic contribution to the @xmath11 is much more repulsive than to the @xmath48 .",
    "in addition the @xmath11 is the @xmath44 state , while the pair @xmath48 belongs to the @xmath46 band . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath11 must lie much higher than the @xmath48 .",
    "all these features are well seen in the explicit 3-body calculations @xcite .",
    "the qcd lagrangian with three light flavors has a global symmetry    @xmath49    if one neglects the masses of current u , d , and s quarks , which are small compared to a typical low - energy qcd scale of 1 gev .",
    "the @xmath3 is not a symmetry at the quantum level due to the axial anomaly .",
    "if the @xmath0 chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian were intact in the vacuum state we would observe degenerate multiplets in the particle spectrum corresponding to the above chiral group , and all hadrons would have their degenerate partners with opposite parity . since this does not happen the implication is that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down to @xmath50 in the qcd vacuum , i.e. , realized in the hidden nambu - goldstone mode .",
    "a direct evidence for the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is a nonzero value of the quark condensates for the light flavors    @xmath51    which represents the order parameter . that this is indeed so , we know from three independent sources : current algebra @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "there are two important generic consequences of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the first one is an appearance of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass , @xmath52 , which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons .",
    "the second one is that valence quarks acquire a dynamical or constituent mass .",
    "both these consequences of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are well illustrated by , e.g. the @xmath53-model @xcite or the nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "we can not say at the moment for sure what the microscopical reason for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the qcd vacuum is .",
    "it was suggested that this occurs when quarks propagate through instantons in the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "for the low - energy baryon properties it is only essential that beyond the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale new dynamical degrees of freedom appear - constituent quarks and chiral fields .",
    "the low - energy baryon properties are mainly determined by these dynamical degrees of freedom and the confining interaction .",
    "this is quite in contrast to pseudoscalar mesons . in the chiral limit",
    ", @xmath54 , all members of the pseudoscalar octet ( @xmath52 ) would have zero mass , which is most clearly seen in the gell - mann - oakes - renner @xcite relations    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    that relate the pseudoscalar meson masses to the quark condensates and current quark masses @xmath60 .",
    "thus the nonzero masses of mesons are determined by the nonzero values of the current quark masses . in the baryon case , even in the chiral limit , baryons would have approximately their actual masses of the order of 1 gev , as these masses are mostly determined by the dynamical ( constituent ) masses , the goldstone boson exchange interaction among them , as well as a confining interaction .",
    "the dynamical ( constituent ) masses are in turn determined mainly by the quark condensates , which is most clearly seen from the gap equations of the nambu and jona - lasinio model , and only weakly dependent on current quark masses .",
    "the role of the current quark masses in baryons is to break just the @xmath4 symmetry in the baryon spectrum .",
    "the importance of the constraints posed by chiral symmetry for the quark bag @xcite and bag - like @xcite models for the baryons has been recognized early . in bag models with",
    "restored chiral symmetry on the bag surface , or bag - like models , the massless current quarks within the bag were assumed to interact not only by perturbative gluon exchange but also through chiral meson field exchange . in these models the chiral field has the character of a compensating auxiliary field only , rather than a collective low frequency goldstone quark - antiquark excitation .",
    "the possibility of a nonzero quark condensate was also not addressed .",
    "as it was discussed in a previous section , it is the quark condensate which is the most important characteristic determining the baryon properties . according to the bag philosophy ,",
    "however , there is a perturbative qcd phase inside a bag , where all condensates vanish by definition .",
    "a general limitation of all bag and bag - like models is , of course , the lack of translational invariance , which is of crucial importance for a description of the excited states .",
    "common to these models is that the breaking of chiral symmetry arises from the confining interaction .",
    "this point of view contrasts with that of manohar and georgi @xcite , who pointed out that there should be two different scales in qcd with 3 flavors . at the first one of these , @xmath61 1  gev , the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry occurs , and hence at distances beyond @xmath62 0.2 fm the valence current quarks acquire their dynamical ( constituent ) mass ( called `` chiral quarks '' in @xcite ) , and the goldstone bosons ( mesons ) appear .",
    "the other scale , @xmath63 mev , is that which characterizes confinement , and the inverse of this scale roughly coincides with the linear size of a baryon . between these two scales",
    "then the effective lagrangian should be formed out of the gluon fields that provide a confining mechanism , as well as of the constituent quark and pseudoscalar meson fields .",
    "manohar and georgi did not , however , specify whether the baryons should be described as bound qqq states or as chiral solitons .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking scale above fits well with that which appears in the instanton liquid picture of the qcd vacuum @xcite . in this model",
    "the quark condensates ( i.e. , equilibrium of virtual quark - antiquark pairs in the vacuum state ) , as well as the gluon condensate , are supported by instanton fluctuations of a size @xmath64 fm .",
    "diakonov and petrov @xcite suggested that at low momenta ( i.e. , beyond the chiral symmetry breaking scale ) qcd should be approximated by an effective chiral lagrangian of the sigma - model type that contains valence quarks with dynamical ( constituent ) masses and meson fields .",
    "they considered a nucleon as three constituent quarks moving independently of one another in a self - consistent chiral field of the hedgehog form @xcite . in this picture",
    "the @xmath8 appears as a rotational excitation of the hedgehog , and no explicit confining interaction is included .",
    "a very similar description for the nucleon was suggested in @xcite .",
    "these types of models are now called `` quark - soliton models '' @xcite .    the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and its consequences - dynamical quark mass generation , appearance of the quark condensate , and pseudoscalar mesons as goldstone excitations - are well illustrated by the nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "this model lacks a confining interaction , which , as argued below , is essential for a realistic description of the properties of baryon physics .",
    "in an effective chiral description of the baryon structure , based on the constituent quark model , the coupling of the quarks and the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons will ( in the @xmath4 symmetric approximation ) have the form @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 is the fermion constituent quark field operator , @xmath68 the octet boson field operator , and @xmath69 is a coupling constant . a coupling of this form , in a nonrelativistic reduction for the constituent quark spinors , will  to lowest order  give rise to a yukawa interaction between the constituent quarks , the spin - spin component of which has the form @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the masses of the interacting quarks , and @xmath73 that of the meson .",
    "there will also be an associated tensor component , which is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at short range the simple form ( [ 5.1 ] ) of the chiral boson exchange interaction can not be expected to be realistic and should only be taken to be suggestive . because of the finite spatial extent of both the constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons the delta function in ( [ 5.1 ] ) should be replaced by a finite function , with a range of 0.6 - 0.7 fm , as suggested by the spatial extent of the mesons .",
    "in addition , the radial behaviour of the yukawa potential ( [ 5.1 ] ) is valid only if the boson field satisfies a linear klein - gordon equation .",
    "the implications of the underlying chiral symmetry of qcd for the effective chiral lagrangian ( which in fact is not known ) , which contains constituent quarks as well as boson fields , are that these boson fields can not be described by linear equations near their source .",
    "therefore it is only at large distances , where the amplitude of the boson fields is small , that the quark - quark interaction reduces to the simple yukawa form .",
    "the latter point is rather important and has to be clarified . the radial dependence in ( [ 5.1 ] )",
    "is a direct consequence of a free @xmath74 green function for the boson field , and a pseudoscalar @xmath65 or pseudovector @xmath66 coupling in both quark - meson vertices .",
    "making use of the usual `` static approximation '' and neglecting the recoil corrections at both vertices in a nonrelativistic reduction for the constituent quark spinors , one arrives at ( [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "the free green function above comes from the well - known lagrangian for a free boson field @xmath75 , which means that the boson field satisfies a linear klein - gordon equation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the underlying @xmath76 chiral symmetry of qcd tells that the goldstone boson field can not be described by such a simple klein - gordon lagrangian .",
    "the transformation properties of the goldstone boson field under @xmath77 and @xmath78 chiral rotations , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are well defined if the goldstone boson fields @xmath68 are combined in a unitary matrix @xcite    @xmath81    @xmath82    the `` kinetic term '' in this case is    @xmath83    which in its expansion in powers of @xmath84 contains not only a free klein - gordon kinetic term but also other terms of higher powers .",
    "for instance , the terms of fourth order in the meson field give rise to @xmath85 scattering @xcite , etc .",
    "the full chiral lagrangian describing the goldstone boson field is unknown and should contain a quartic term involving derivatives @xmath86 and higher order terms .",
    "it is clear that a dressed green function for the field @xmath84 should be very different compared to the free klein - gordon green function since the selfinteraction of the goldstone boson field is important . only far away from its source ( the fermion current ) , where the amplitude of the boson field @xmath84 is small , the lowest term in powers of @xmath84 becomes dominant , and therefore only at large distances the quark - quark interaction reduces to its simple yukawa form .",
    "_ at this stage the proper procedure should be to avoid further specific assumptions about the short range behavior of @xmath87 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , to extract instead the required matrix elements of it from the baryon spectrum , and to reconstruct by this an approximate radial form of @xmath87 .",
    "the overall minus sign in the effective chiral boson interaction in ( [ 1.1 ] ) corresponds to that of the short range term in the yukawa interaction .",
    "_    the flavor structure of the pseudoscalar octet exchange interaction in ( [ 1.1 ] ) between two quarks @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be understood as follows : @xmath90 the first term in ( [ 5.5 ] ) represents the pion - exchange interaction , which acts only between light quarks .",
    "the second term represents the kaon exchange interaction , which takes place in u - s and d - s pair states .",
    "the @xmath91-exchange , which is represented by the third term , is allowed in all quark pair states . in the @xmath4",
    "symmetric limit the constituent quark masses would be equal ( @xmath92 ) , the pseudoscalar octet would be degenerate and the meson - constituent quark coupling constant would be flavor independent . in this limit",
    "the form of the pseudoscalar exchange interaction reduces to ( [ 1.1 ] ) , which does not break the @xmath4 invariance of the baryon spectrum . beyond this limit the pion , kaon and @xmath91 exchange interactions will differ ( @xmath93 ) , because of the difference between the strange and u",

    "all these functions are well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the color state @xmath23_{\\rm c}$ ] , which is common to all the states , has been suppressed in ( [ 6.6 ] ) . by the pauli principle @xmath98_{\\rm x}=[f]_{\\rm fs}$ ] .",
    "the full hamiltonian is the sum of the confining hamiltonian and the chiral field interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "when the boson exchange interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) is treated in first order perturbation theory , the mass of the baryon states takes the form    @xmath135    where the chiral interaction contribution is @xmath136 and @xmath137 the contribution from the chiral interaction to each baryon is a linear combination of the matrix elements of the two - body potential @xmath138 , defined as @xmath139 represents the oscillator wavefunction with @xmath140 excited quanta . as we shall only consider the baryon states in the @xmath141 bands , we shall only need the four radial matrix elements @xmath142 and @xmath143 for the numerical construction of the spectrum .",
    "the contributions to all nucleon , @xmath8 and @xmath14-hyperon states from the boson exchange interaction , in terms of the matrix elements @xmath144 , are listed in tables 1 and 2 . in this approximate @xmath4-invariant version of the chiral boson exchange interaction the @xmath145 and the @xmath146 mass differences",
    "would solely be ascribed to the mass difference between the s and u , d quarks , since all these baryons have identical orbital structure and permutational symmetries .",
    "the states in the @xmath14-spectrum would be degenerate with the corresponding states in the @xmath16-spectrum which have equal symmetries .",
    "the oscillator parameter @xmath121 and the four integrals are extracted from the mass differences between the nucleon and the @xmath147 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath10 , as well as the splittings between the nucleon and the average mass of the two pairs of states @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this procedure yields the parameter values @xmath121=157.4 mev , @xmath150=29.3 mev , @xmath151=45.2 mev , @xmath152=2.7 mev and @xmath143=34.7 mev .",
    "given these values , all other excitation energies ( i.e. , differences between the masses of given resonances and the corresponding ground states ) of the nucleon , @xmath8- and @xmath14-hyperon spectra are predicted to within @xmath153 15% of the empirical values where known , and are well within the uncertainty limits of those values .",
    "note that these matrix elements provide a quantitatively satisfactory description of the @xmath14-spectrum even though they are extracted from the @xmath154 spectrum .",
    "the relative magnitudes and signs of the numerical parameter values can be readily understood .",
    "if the potential function @xmath155 is assumed to have the form of a yukawa function with a smeared @xmath156-function term that is positive at short range @xmath157 fm , as suggested by the pion size @xmath158 fm , one expects @xmath152 to be considerably smaller than @xmath150 and @xmath151 , as the radial wavefunction of the excited s - state has a node , and as it extends further into the region where the potential is negative .",
    "the negative value for @xmath143 is also natural , since the corresponding wavefunction is suppressed at short range and extends well beyond the expected node in the potential function .",
    "the model described above has relied on an interaction potential function @xmath87 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) that is flavor independent .",
    "a refined version takes into account the explicit flavor dependence of the potential function in ( [ 5.5 ] ) ( @xmath93 ) . in the following",
    "we show how this explicit flavor dependence provides an explanation of the mass splitting between the @xmath14 and the @xmath16 which have the same quark content and the same fs , f and s symmetries , i.e. , they are degenerate within the @xmath4 version ( [ 1.1 ] ) of the chiral boson exchange interaction .    beyond the @xmath4 limit",
    "the ground state baryons will be determined by the @xmath159-exchange radial integral @xmath160 , the k - exchange one , @xmath161 , and by the @xmath91-exchange integrals , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where the superscripts indicate quark pairs to which the @xmath91-exchange applies . as indicated by the yukawa interaction ( [ 5.1 ] ) these matrix elements should be inversely proportional to the product of the quark masses of the pair state .",
    "thus @xmath165 we also assume that @xmath166 , which is suggested by the fact that the quark masses are equal in the states in which these interactions act , and by the near equality of the kaon and @xmath91 masses , @xmath167 .",
    "thus we have only two independent radial integrals .    to determine the integrals @xmath160 , @xmath161 and the quark mass difference @xmath168 we consider the @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 splittings :    @xmath172    @xmath173    @xmath174    which imply @xmath161 = 19.6 mev , @xmath175 mev , if the conventional value of 340 mev is given to @xmath176 , @xmath177 mev and the quark mass ratio @xmath178 .",
    "these values of the matrix elements lead to the values of 65 mev and 139 mev for the @xmath179 and the @xmath180 mass differences    @xmath181    @xmath182    in good agreement with the empirical values of 77 mev and 125 mev , respectively .",
    "a description of the other parts of the @xmath16 , @xmath103 and @xmath110 spectra can be found in @xcite .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) , taken to first order perturbation theory and without explicit parameterizing the radial dependence , can explain the correct level ordering of positive and negative parity states in light and strange baryon spectra , as well as the splittings in those spectra .",
    "a question , however , arises about what will happen beyond first order perturbation theory . in order to check this",
    "we have numericaly solved three - body faddeev equations @xcite . besides the confinement potential , which is now taken in linear form , the gbe interaction between the constituent quarks",
    "is now included to all orders . these results",
    "further support the adequacy of the gbe for baryon spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to the octet - exchange interaction we include here also the flavor - singlet ( @xmath1 ) exchange . in the large @xmath183 limit",
    "the axial anomaly becomes suppressed @xcite , and the @xmath1 becomes the ninth goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken @xmath184 chiral symmetry in addition to the octet of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "+ for the gbe the spin - spin component of the interaction between the constituent quarks @xmath88 and @xmath89 reads :    @xmath185    where @xmath186 are flavor gell - mann matrices and @xmath187 .    in the simplest case ,",
    "when the boson field satisfies the linear klein - gordon equation , one has the following spatial dependence for the meson - exchange potentials in ( [ 8.1 ] ) :    @xmath188    @xmath189    with quark and meson masses @xmath71 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "( [ 8.2 ] ) contains both the traditional long - range yukawa potential as well as a @xmath156-function term .",
    "it is the latter that is of crucial importance for baryon physics .",
    "we already discussed in section 5 that it is strictly valid only for pointlike particles , and that it must be smeared out since the constituent quarks and pseudoscalar mesons have finite size , and in addition the boson fields in a chiral lagrangian should in fact satisfy a nonlinear equation . furthermore it is quite natural to assume that at distances @xmath191 , where @xmath192 can be related to the constituent quark and pseudoscalar meson sizes , there is no chiral boson - exchange interaction , since this is the region of perturbative qcd with the original qcd degrees of freedom . the interactions at these very short distances are not essential for the low - energy properties of baryons .",
    "consequently we use a two - parameter `` representation '' for the @xmath156-function term in ( [ 8.2 ] )    @xmath193    following the arguments above one should also cut off the yukawa part of the gbe for @xmath194 .    the @xmath195 coupling constant can be extracted from the phenomenological pion - nucleon coupling @xcite as @xmath196 . for simplicity ( and to avoid any additional free parameter ) , the same coupling constant is assumed for the coupling between the @xmath91- meson and the constituent quark .",
    "this is exactly in the spirit of unbroken @xmath4 symmetry . for the flavor - singlet @xmath1 ,",
    "however , we must take a different coupling @xmath197 , as the @xmath1 decouples from the pseudoscalar octet due to the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "this fact is illustrated best by the failure of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relations @xcite for the flavor singlet @xcite . lacking a phenomenological value , we treat @xmath198 as a free parameter .",
    "the constituent masses of the u and d quarks are taken to be 340 mev , as suggested by the nucleon magnetic moments .    in the present calculation",
    "we neglect tensor meson - exchange forces .",
    "we expect their role to be of minor importance for the main features of the baryon spectra @xcite ( mainly due to the absence of the strong @xmath156-function part in this case ) .",
    "our full interquark potential is thus given by    @xmath199    while all masses and the octet coupling constant are predetermined , we treated @xmath192 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 as free parameters and determined their values to be :    @xmath203    notice that we do not need any constant @xmath204 , which is usually added to the confining potential .",
    "in fact only _ four _ free parameters suffice to describe all 14 lowest states of the @xmath27 and @xmath8 spectra , including the absolute value of the nucleon ( ground state ) . at the present stage of determining the qq potential due to gbe",
    "we were led by the principle of working with the smallest possible number of free parameters .",
    "therefore we took the octet coupling constant @xmath205 , and likewise the constituent quark mass @xmath206 , as predetermined .",
    "of course , one may expect that subsequent studies within the gbe model will put further constraints on the parametrization of the @xmath207 potential .",
    "the qq potential ( [ 8.4 ] ) constitutes the dynamical input into our 3-body faddeev calculations of the baryon spectra .",
    "we show our results in fig . 1 for the parametrization of the qq interaction as given above .",
    "it is well seen that the whole set of lowest @xmath27 and @xmath8 states is reproduced quite correctly . in the most unfavourable cases deviations from the experimental values do not exceed 3% !",
    "in addition all level orderings are correct .",
    "in particular , the positive - parity state @xmath10 ( roper resonance ) lies _ below _ the pair of negative - parity states @xmath39 - @xmath112 .",
    "the same is true in the @xmath8 spectrum with @xmath11 and the pair @xmath128 - @xmath129 .",
    "we emphasize again that the qq potential ( [ 8.4 ] ) is able to predict also the absolute value of the nucleon mass . in previous models",
    "an arbitrary constant was usually needed to achieve the correct value of 939 mev .    at the present stage of our investigation of the baryon spectra with the gbe interaction",
    "we have left out the tensor forces .",
    "therefore the fine - structure splittings in the @xmath208-multiplets are not yet introduced .",
    "however , it is clear from the observed smallness of these splittings and from the arguments given above , that the tensor component of the gbe can play only a minor role .",
    "here we also note that the yukawa part of the interaction in ( [ 8.2 ] ) is only of secondary importance .",
    "in fact , the pattern of fig . 1 could also be described with the `` @xmath156-part '' ( [ 8.3 ] ) alone ( and a slightly modified set of parameters ) .",
    "it is instructive to learn how the gbe affects the energy levels when it is switched on and its strength ( coupling constant ) is gradually increased ( fig .",
    "2 ) . starting out from the case with confinement",
    "only , one observes that the degeneracy of states is removed and an inversion of the ordering of positive- and negative - parity states is achieved , both in the @xmath27 and @xmath8 excitations . from fig . 2 also",
    "the crucial importance of the chiral interaction @xmath209 becomes evident .",
    "notice that the strength of our confinement , @xmath202= 0.474 @xmath210 , is rather small and the confining interaction contributes much less to the splittings than the gbe .",
    "the relative `` weakness '' of our effective confining interaction could be due to a partial cancellation between the much stronger color - electric confinement and the @xmath53-exchange since they are of opposite sign .",
    "due to the same reason one can not expect that the effective confining interaction between the constituent quarks is strictly of linear form .",
    "a flavor dependent interaction of the form ( [ 1.1 ] ) will imply the presence of an irreducible two - body exchange current operator , as seen , e.g. , directly from the continuity equation , by which the commutator of the interaction and the single particle charge operator is equal to the divergence of the exchange current density @xcite .",
    "the general form of the octet vector exchange current operator , that is associated with the complete octet mediated interaction ( [ 5.5 ] ) , is @xcite    @xmath211    here @xmath212 and @xmath213 are dimensionless functions that describe @xmath159 and @xmath214 exchange , respectively , and which include both the pionic ( kaonic ) current and the pair current term at long range .",
    "consider a simplified nonrelativistic constituent quark model .",
    "the impulse approximation expressions for the magnetic moments of the ground state octet baryons and their experimental values are listed in table 3 ( columns `` ia '' and `` exp '' , respectively ) .",
    "a natural approach is to determine the mass ratios @xmath215 and @xmath216 to fit the experimental values of the magnetic moments of the @xmath217 and @xmath218 octet and the @xmath110 and @xmath219 ( @xmath220 , @xmath221 ) decuplet baryons , which are unaffected by the exchange current operator ( [ 9.1 ] ) .",
    "while with only two independent variables it is not possible to fit all four experimental magnetic moments exactly , the best overall fit , @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 , happens to be obtained with precisely the ratios @xmath226 and @xmath227 , which were used for the constituent quark masses to fit ground state baryons ( @xmath228 mev and @xmath229 mev ) .",
    "we find ( see table 3 ) that the meson exchange current contributions systematically improve the predictions of the naive constituent quark model ( i.e. , with one - body quark currents only ) for all known magnetic moments .",
    ".magnetic moments of the baryon octet ( in nuclear magnetons ) .",
    "column ia contains the quark model impulse approximation expressions , column `` exp '' the experimental values , column i the impulse approximation predictions , column ii the exchange current contribution with @xmath230     as the constituent quarks are not too heavy , both their electromagnetic and axial current operators have significant relativistic correction terms .",
    "their effect is to reduce the magnitude of the predicted values of both the axial coupling constants and the magnetic moments of the baryons that are given by the static quark model .",
    "this correction reduces the standard overprediction of the axial current coupling constant of the nucleon ( 5/3 vs 1.24 ) and the strange baryons , but it worsens the mostly satisfactory predictions for the magnetic moments of the baryons that are obtained with the static quark model . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the exchange current corrections associated with the chiral boson exchange interaction between the quarks can compensate for the relativistic correction in the latter case , while leaving it operative in the case of the axial coupling constants .",
    "this then makes it possible to obtain at least qualitatively satisfactory simultaneous description of both the magnetic moments and the axial coupling constants .",
    "instead of a conclusion we discuss some important recent lattice qcd results in this last section .",
    "it was shown already a few years ago that one can obtain a qualitatively correct splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath27 already within a quenched approximation ( for a review and references see @xcite ) . within the quenched approximation to qcd the sea quark closed loop diagrams generated by gluon lines",
    "are neglected .",
    "thus in the quenched approximation for baryons one takes into account only 3 continuous valence quark lines and full gluodynamics .",
    "this quenched approximation contains , however , part of antiquark effects related to the z graphs formed of valence quark lines .",
    "one can even construct diagrams within the quenched approximation which correspond to the exchange of the color - singlet isospin 1 or 0 @xmath231 pairs between valence quark lines @xcite .",
    "it is also important that these diagrams contribute to the baryon mass to leading order ( @xmath232 ) in a @xmath233 expansion @xcite ( their contribution to the @xmath234 splitting appears , however , to subleading orders ) .    from the quenched measurements @xcite it is not clear",
    "what were the physical reason for the @xmath234 splitting : gluon exchanges , instantons , or something else . to clarify this question , liu and dong",
    "have recently measured the @xmath234 splitting in the quenched and a further so - called `` valence approximation '' @xcite . in the valence approximation the quarks are limited to propagating only forward in time ( i.e. , z graphs and related quark - antiquark pairs are removed ) .",
    "the gluon exchange and all other possible gluon configurations , including instantons , are exactly the same in both approximations .",
    "the striking result is that the @xmath234 splitting is observed only in the quenched approximation but not in the valence approximation , in which the @xmath27 and the @xmath8 levels are degenerate within error bars .",
    "consequently the @xmath234 splitting must receive a considerable contribution from the diagrams with @xmath231 excitations , which correspond to the meson exchanges , but not from the gluon exchange or instanton - induced interaction between quarks ( to be precise , the instanton - induced interaction could be rather important for the interactions between quarks and antiquarks ) .",
    "if the observation of liu and dong is confirmed it would be important to measure the relative positions of the lowest excited states of positive and negative parity in the @xmath27 , @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 spectra within both the quenched and the valence approximation .",
    "one expects that , if the entire @xmath235 splitting ( i.e. , 300 mev ) is due to the antiquark excitations in the quenched approximation , then @xmath236 should be below the negative parity pair @xmath237 , while in the @xmath14 spectrum the situation should be opposite : the negative parity pair @xmath238 should be below the first positive parity excitation @xmath239 . in the valence approximation",
    "the spin - spin force among quarks , which is due to goldstone boson exchange , is absent , and the relative position of @xmath236 and @xmath237 should be just opposite to the quenched approximation : the @xmath236 should be above the negative parity pair",
    ". however , in the @xmath14 spectrum the negative parity pair @xmath238 should still be below the @xmath239 .",
