    "detecting faint objects in the solar system is a technically challenging problem .",
    "the approaches taken in the past can be broken into two basic categories : inter - frame source detection and linking , and the `` shift - and - stack '' approach .",
    "inter - frame detection , where transient sources are detected in individual exposures and motion is linked between multiple exposures , is widely employed and favored in planned proposed surveys like pan - starrs ( denneau et al .",
    "2007 ) and lsst ( axelrod et al . 2009 ) due to its simplicity and robustness .",
    "this method , however , does not exploit imaging data to the fullest extent possible , since detections are subject to the completeness limit of individual frames .",
    "since solar system objects are moving across the sky , their images trail and the noise contribution from the sky background increases . trailing losses create an upper limit to individual frame exposure times for efficient detection of solar system objects .",
    "it is advantageous to combine multiple exposures , each short enough that trailing effects are negligible .",
    "co - addition is routinely done to improve the sn of stationary sources and to remove cosmic ray events , but in order to apply it to the detection of moving objects several other steps must be performed .",
    "first , contamination from stationary sources can be removed by subtracting a high - sn template image from each image in the set .",
    "next , the sky motion of the objects of interest must be predicted and this motion compensated for by shifting each image s pixels in software . when the images are then combined only the flux from sources that moved at the predicted rates will be constructively added .",
    "this method first appeared in literature in tyson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , though details of the application were limited .",
    "an early detailed description of this technique was presented by cochran et al .",
    "a set of images from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) _ wide field planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) were combined to allow statistical detection of very faint tnos .",
    "the sky motion of the sources was parameterized as angular rates ( @xmath0 ) and angles on the sky ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "gladman et al . (",
    "1997 ) used the same technique in order to combine a series of images from the _ palomar _ 5 m telescope in the hope of constraining the size distribution of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) by discovering objects with smaller radii than had been detected in most previous wide - area surveys that employed inter - frame detection .",
    "this survey was followed by further searches from _ keck _ ( luu & jewitt 1998 ; chaing & brown 1999 ) , _ ctio _ ( allen et al .",
    "2001 and 2002 ; fraser et al .",
    "2008 ) , _ palomar _ ( gladman et al . 1998 ) , _ vlt _ and _ cfht _ ( gladman et al . 2001 ) , which employed the same technique to varying degrees of success .",
    "recently , fraser & kavelaars ( 2009 ) and fuentes , george , & holman ( 2009 ) both used similar techniques to search _ subaru _ data for kbos as faint as @xmath2 .",
    "all of these surveys had observational arcs less than two days in length .",
    "over periods this short , the motion of outer solar system sources can be well approximated ( with respect to ground - based seeing ) by the linear trajectories that the method these surveys implemented implicitly assumes . for longer arcs or higher - resolution data , however , the approximation of a linear trajectory is no longer adequate .",
    "bernstein et al . ( 2004 ) employed a more advanced approach , which they called `` digital tracking , '' to extremely high - resolution hst _ advanced camera for surveys _",
    "( acs ) data . even in arcs on the order of a day in length , nonlinear components of motion were non - negligible relative to the acs psf . in order to stack frames such that distant moving sources add constructively in this regime it becomes necessary to generate nonlinear shift - vectors via full ephemerides from orbits of interest .",
    "they stacked arcs up to 24 hours in length using shift - vectors parameterized as a grid over three parameters : two linear components of motion and heliocentric distance @xmath3 . by sampling densely over this grid , they were able to recover orbits with @xmath4 au @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and detect objects as faint as @xmath7 . however , this dense sampling , somewhat unconstrained discovery volume , and extremely small psf required @xmath8 shift - vectors , which translated into @xmath9 pixels to be searched .",
    "bernstein et al . found that stacking more than 24 hours of their data became computationally prohibitive .    in the age of ground - based gigapixel ccd mosaic imagers ,",
    "how is data obtained over long arcs going to be efficiently exploited to search for faint sources ? in the interest of exploring massive datasets with long observation arcs to as deep a limit as possible , we have created a simple probabilistic method for generating an optimized set of shift - vectors for any imaging survey and any interesting volume of orbital element space . by generating shift - vectors in a probabilistic way , exploring",
    "an explicitly demarcated region of orbital parameter space becomes straightforward .",
    "the targeted region of orbital parameter space is searched with uniform sensitivity , simplifying the accurate characterization of any detected sample of objects .",
    "this method also avoids searching non - physical or uninteresting parameter space , thereby maximizing scientific return for minimum computational cost .    in section [ mte ] ,",
    "we define the maximum tracking error , the basic parameter that defines the density of a grid .",
    "section [ mc ] describes previous analytical methods for search - grid parameterization , our probabilistic approach , and a grid - tree structure for optimizing multiple - night arcs .",
    "section [ comp ] compares the efficiency of our method to those used in previous surveys , and in section [ lsst ] we show an example application of this method to the kind of data that may be acquired by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "previous on - ecliptic surveys ( eg . , fraser & kavelaars 2009 ) have used simple analytical estimates for the apparent on - sky rates of motion for distant solar system objects in order to generate shift rates . for an on - ecliptic observation of a field @xmath10 degrees from opposition",

    "the linear tracking error @xmath38 adds an additional rectangular region to the area of the source , with width @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the aperture radius applied to the initial circular source ) and length @xmath38 .",

    "surveys using automated detection pipelines have decreased @xmath37 to limit their signal - to - noise loss , and leveraged massive computational resources to compensate for the increased number of required shift - vectors ( eg . , fuentes et al .",

    "the methods for generating shift - vectors described above are cumbersome to analytically generalize over any region of the sky , arbitrary regions of orbital parameter space , and arbitrarily long observational baselines as they still suffer from the problem of non - linear components of motion that become significant as @xmath42 grows . in this regime",
    "it becomes necessary to add additional dimensions to the search grid ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 , for example ) , and selecting an optimized set of grid - points becomes a challenge .",
    "instead of pursuing an analytical solution , in the following section we outline a simple probabilistic approach for defining an optimum set of shift - vectors for any region of the sky and over any length of observational baseline at any solar elongation .    instead of approximating the minimum and maximum angular rates of motion and angle on the sky for an ad - hoc subset of the orbits of interest",
    ", our method takes the following approach : first , generate a very large sample of synthetic orbits that fill ( in a characterized way ) the orbital parameter space of interest .",
    "second , use ephemeris software to determine the ( @xmath83 ) shift between frames for every synthetic orbit in every imaged epoch .",
    "finally , search for the optimum ( smallest ) subset of orbits whose motions accurately represent the motions of the entire set of synthetic orbits within a maximum tracking error tolerance .",
    "the set of ( @xmath83 ) shifts ( translated into ( @xmath84 ) pixel shifts ) from this representative set of orbits is our optimum set of shift - vectors .",
    "a more detailed description of the method follows .      to create our initial sample",
    ", we use a randomly generated set of synthetic orbits that fill a region of orbital parameter space of interest such that the orbital ephemerides intersect the imaged field during the times of observation .",
    "the approach to filling orbital parameter space is subject to some consideration , as any orbital - space biases may translate into a skewed on - sky motion distribution , resulting in a biased selection of `` optimum '' orbits . over small ranges of @xmath3 ,",

    "sampling inclination from the distribution of an isotropic sphere ( probability of @xmath94 ) may seem appropriate so as not to bias the on - sky motion distribution to that of low inclination orbits , but because the component of motion perpendicular to the ecliptic is roughly @xmath95 , and because the small area of any imaged field with respect to the entire sky places stronger limits on the phase - space volume available to high - inclination objects than that available to low - inclination objects , we contend that is preferable to sample @xmath12 from a uniform distribution .",

    "duplicate the set of inclinations with @xmath98 .",
    "the remaining orbital elements to be generated are the node and the argument of perihelion .",
    "these can be rotated to force the object to fall on the imaged field during the dates of observation , and should fill the parameter space set by these constraints smoothly . @xmath93 and",
    "the argument of perihelion are coupled for objects in mean motion resonances , but for the purposes presented here it is convenient to simplify the treatment by treating the two as independent .",
    "depending on the size of the orbital region of interest and the length of the observational arc , the number of synthetic orbits required to produce a statistically adequate sample varies .",
    "the basic requirement is that the density of points in the final ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) plane is such that the max spacing between any two nearest neighbors in the initial sample is @xmath99 , ensuring that there are no empty bins in ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) given circular bins with radius @xmath37 . in trials , we found that this required the initial sample size to range from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of synthetic orbits .",
    "once a set of synthetic orbits has been created , the shift - vectors for each orbit can be determined .",
    "we define the shift - vector for orbit @xmath54 in image @xmath12 to be a point in the ( @xmath100 ) as given by @xmath101 in eqn .",
    "the list of shift - vectors @xmath102 $ ] is stored as a list linked to the orbit @xmath54 for which they were generated .",
    "we then compare each list of shift - vectors to determine the optimum set , which is the smallest subset which have motions that accurately represent the whole set within some spatial tolerance in the image plane .",
    "we set this tolerance by specifying that all synthetic orbits in the initial sample must be matched to the motions of at least one orbit in the optimum sample to within our maximum tracking error tolerance @xmath37 in every imaged epoch .",
    "in other words , every synthetic orbit @xmath54 must be matched to at least one optimum orbit @xmath103 in every image @xmath12 by @xmath104 .      for observational baselines",
    "over which any nonlinear component of motion is negligible compared to @xmath13 , the largest offset between any orbit and the nearest predicted motion vector will always occur in the final image @xmath105 . to generate shift - vectors in this regime ,",
    "we use the following approach :    1 .   propagate all synthetic orbits in the initial sample forward to the final image ( @xmath105 ) plane and record the final shift - vector @xmath106 for each orbit",
    "find the median of the distribution of shift - vectors and set the corresponding point in ( @xmath107 ) to be the center of a geometrically - optimum triangular grid with sidelength @xmath108 that extends over a region of ( @xmath107 ) significantly larger than the that occupied by any synthetic orbits in the initial sample .",
    "2 .   from this initial large grid ,",
    "select only those grid points that have one or more synthetic orbits whose final shift - vector lies within @xmath38 of it in ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "record the list of orbits that are matched to each grid point .",
    "3 .   after the initial grid has been cut down to just those grid points that are matched to at least one synthetic orbit ,",
    "find the smallest subset that are matched to _ unique _ synthetic orbits : first , select the grid point that is matched to the largest number of synthetic orbits , set it and its list of orbits aside , then remove the references to each synthetic orbit recovered by that grid point from all other grid points .",
    "repeat this process for the remaining grid points , until all the original synthetic orbits are accounted for in the set - aside list .",
    "all set - aside grid points are now identified as the optimum set for recovering the initial sample of synthetic orbits , given this grid geometry and orientation .",
    "iterate steps 1 - 3 several times , each time rotating the initial grid around its central point by some small angle @xmath109 ( up to a total rotation of @xmath110 ) .",
    "record the number of optimum grid points required for each orientation , and select the orientation that requires the fewest . as a small refinement , if any of the optimum grid points are found to lie with _",
    "centers _ outside the distribution of synthetic orbits in the ( @xmath107 ) plane , we shift its center to the nearest ( @xmath107 ) point from a synthetic orbit . after this refinement ,",
    "the set of optimum grid points from this orientation are defined as our final optimum set .",
    "these grid points are points in the final ( @xmath111 ) plane .",
    "we can back out the implied set of optimum ( @xmath112 ) rates by simply dividing the respective components of each grid point by the total observational baseline @xmath113 .",
    "the rotation in step 4 is included to address boundary conditions .",
    "if the region of ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) searched by a grid is not @xmath114 , then there will be a preferred orientation of the grid .",
    "however , if @xmath37 is small relative to the total region , this step is unnecessary .    if , instead of trimming the search - grid to as small a number of points as possible , it is preferable to create a `` safe '' grid that over - searches the boundaries in rate - space by some comfortable margin , then modify step 2 to select grid points that lie within a larger distance @xmath115 of any final shift - vector .",
    "step 3 must be skipped in this case .",
    "this maintains the grid spacing and geometry , but adds a `` buffer '' region around each synthetic orbit .      in the case that the observational baseline @xmath113 is long enough such that non - linear components of motion are non - negligible with respect to @xmath38 , a different treatment is required . instead of presuming that the largest offset between the motions of a given orbit and the nearest grid point will occur in the final frame @xmath105 , we must instead ensure that for every synthetic orbit there is one non - linear shift - vector which matches its motions within @xmath38 _ in every frame_. while nonlinear components of motion are non - negligible , the dominant factor driving the number of shift - vectors required is still the linear components of motion .    1 .   after creating an initial sample of synthetic orbits ,",
    "generate a search grid via the short - arc ( linear ) solution for the observations . when generating the search grid , set the effective maximum tracking error to be slightly smaller than the desired final maximum tracking error .",
    "this is to take into account that the final grid will be selected from a _ discrete _ distribution ; namely , the motions of the synthetic orbits in the initial sample .",
    "2 .   for each grid point",
    "@xmath116 on the optimum _ linear _ search grid , take the list @xmath117 of orbits uniquely matched to that grid point and consider their shift - vectors in every imaged epoch .",
    "for each orbit @xmath54 in list @xmath117 , find all the other orbits within @xmath117 that have motions that are matched to the motion of @xmath54 within the desired maximum tracking error @xmath37 in every frame .",
    "select the single synthetic orbit @xmath118 with motions matched to the largest number of unique synthetic orbits in @xmath117 and set it aside as an _ optimum _ orbit .",
    "4 .   if some of the orbits linked to the grid point @xmath116 are not recovered by the first optimum orbit @xmath118 , remove all orbits recovered by the orbit @xmath118 from consideration , then repeat step 3 to select a second optimum orbit @xmath119 .",
    "repeat step 4 until all the orbits linked to the grid point @xmath116 are accounted for by one or more optimum orbits .",
    "repeat steps @xmath120 for each grid point in the initial solution .",
    "the shift - vectors of the final optimum set of orbits are then identified as the optimum set of non - linear shift - vectors to apply to the given data set .",
    "other significant optimizations can be made to reduce the total number of pixel additions required to search a given data set .",
    "one particular optimization that our probabilistic method lends itself to is the use of a multi - level grid tree described by allen ( 2002 ) .",
    "this approach recognizes that for multi - night stacks , there are essentially two distinct timescales : the unit time periods over which images are obtained ( length of a single night ) , and the total observational baseline .",
    "allen ( 2002 ) points out that a significant reduction in total number of required shift - vectors can be obtained if , instead of combining all images obtained over several nights with one search - grid , images are combined on a per - night basis ( with a single - night grid ) , then these stacks are combined with a _",
    "second _ search grid to remove the motion that would have occurred over the entire period .",
    "if all else remains equal , this tree - of - grids structure results in fewer overall pixel additions , as redundant combinations of images taken on a single night are only performed once .",
    "since this method relies on combining images that are the combination of other images , it can only be applied for combination algorithms that can nest : for example , weighted averaging and co - adding are usable , but not medians .",
    "it is important to note that in combining a tree of grids , the resulting maximum tracking error @xmath37 goes as the sum of each level s tracking errors @xmath121 . as such",
    ", each level s tracking error must be limited to @xmath122 , where @xmath79 is the total number of levels . in the case described here , the tree has two levels , and so the effective tracking error in each level must be limited to @xmath123 .",
    "thus , while this 2-level case requires fewer pixel additions , it results in significantly more pixels to _ search _ than in the 1-level case .",
    "while we have not implemented this method , we can estimate its results . since the number of grid points @xmath79 is approximately proportional to @xmath124 , and the 2-level case requires @xmath125 , we can estimate that this method will require four times as many shift - vectors per unit time interval as a 1-level grid .",
    "if we consider @xmath105 nights of data , where the length of a night is equal to the length of a day such that the total observational baseline is @xmath126 in units of the length of a single night .",
    "thus , if the 1-level grid requires @xmath127 shift - vectors for the full observational timeline , we can estimate that the 2-level grid for the full length of time will require @xmath128 .",
    "the 2-level method will require @xmath129 times more pixels be searched in the final stacks than the 1-layer method .",
    "however , to determine the improvement in pixel additions , we need to determine the size of each nightly grid :    @xmath130    for surveys where the number of observations taken per night @xmath131 such that the number of pixel additions is dominated by the nightly stacks , we can estimate the total number of pixel additions required by :    @xmath132    whereas for the 1-level grid , the number of pixel additions required is @xmath133 .",
    "the resulting improvement in the number of required pixel additions is roughly    @xmath134    so for a two - night arc , we estimate a factor of @xmath135 improvement in the number of pixel additions , while for a three - night arc this increases to @xmath136 .",

    "( 2008 ) , fuentes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and fraser & kavelaars ( 2009 ) , we have shown that the orbital sensitivity of these surveys varied from what was advertised .",
    "their extra sensitivity to the motions of distant sources makes these surveys sensitive to populations like distant members of the scattered disk and sedna - like objects , and their non - detection provide useful upper limits on these populations",
    ". we will explore these upper limits in future work .",
    "since the discovery of extremely high - inclination , low - pericenter objects like 2008 kv@xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) , it is important to understand these surveys sensitivity to such populations .",
    "we note that fuentes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is the only survey characterized here that was sensitive to objects with the same inclination and distance at discovery as 2008 kv@xmath246 ( see figure [ all_surveys ] , bottom - right panel ) , but we contend that it is unlikely that they would have recognized any detection as belonging to this retrograde population .",
    "since follow - up has been performed only rarely for these deep surveys , orbital inclination and heliocentric distance usually remain degenerate , with the prograde solution lying at lower distances ( though this degeneracy is rarely acknowledged ) .",
    "it is possible that detections labeled as high - inclination prograde objects may in fact be objects with retrograde orbits like 2008 kv@xmath246 at greater distance .",
