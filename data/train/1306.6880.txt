    "previous works generally consider analysis of pls of the form @xcite : @xmath0 for @xmath1 . here , @xmath2 is a partition of the state space into a number of polyhedral cells .    for the record ,",
    "the first generic approach in constructing a lyapunov function for a piecewise linear model is the piecewise quadratic lyapunov function ( qlf ) @xcite .",
    "this piecewise qlf method constructs a quadratic lyapunov function in each linear region , and fit each of the pieces together on the boundaries .",
    "this approach is uniform and computationally tractable when the systems contain only fixed points as limit sets .",
    "however , when the systems have oscillating behavior , piecewise qlf can no longer be continuous over the boundaries @xcite .",
    "since complex behaviors like oscillation are quite prevalent in natural and technological systems @xcite , a method of constructing lyapunov functions is needed for the analysis and control of them .",
    "to apply the lyapunov function criteria to the complex situations , many efforts @xcite have attempted to modify the piecewise qlf approach , such as finding multiple qlfs @xcite , obtaining a qlf outside the lasalle invariant set @xcite , and constructing a surface qlf @xcite . but",
    "none have yet addressed the boundary issue to make lyapunov function continuous in the whole phase space .",
    "the multiple qlf aims to focus on the local behaviors of a system in each linear region ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this approach constructs a lyapunov function for each of the linear regions , which is monotonically decreasing along the system s dynamics in the prescribed area .",
    "note that the functions constructed in the different regions do not equal to each other over the boundaries , and hence lacks global properties .",
    "thus , the analytical power of multiple qlf is confined only to the local area , instead of being expandable for the dynamics of the entire system .        on the contrary , the search for the lasalle invariant set does focus on the global behaviors of a system .",
    "this effort constructs a lyapunov function outside of the  lasalle invariant set \" @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the approach therefore only evaluates global stability of the system , while neglects the detailed behaviors within the invariant set .",
    "a more recent effort realizes the difficulty of the qlf approach , and thus does not aim to attain a lyapunov function in a system s complete phase space .",
    "rather , it represents the original system by its  impact map \" @xcite ( generalized poincar map ) on the boundary between linear regions .",
    "quadratic lyapunov function is constructed for this impact map . back into the original phase space ,",
    "this function can be taken as the lyapunov function on the region boundary .",
    "therefore , the approach can provide inspiration for the construction of lyapunov functions .",
    "however , this work itself does not address the original problem , and hence does not provide a stability criteria in the entire phase space .",
    "all the aforementioned quadratic lyapunov function methods try to describe and analyze complex dynamics with oscillation . but",
    "each fails to describe the entire system in a part of the phase space . as a result ,",
    "the lyapunov functions lack certain properties , restricting their applications .",
    "take system identification for example , all the qlf constructed can not distinguish systems with a limit cycle from some systems with multiple fixed points .",
    "this important drawback of the existing methods motivates us to construct lyapunov functions in the whole phase space for the analysis and control of oscillating systems .",
    "first of all , we formally define the lyapunov function in pls :    [ def : cand_lyapunov ]    let @xmath3 be a continuous function . then @xmath4 satisfying the following conditions is called a lyapunov function for the dynamical system @xmath5 .",
    "a.   @xmath6 for all @xmath7 if @xmath8 exists ; b.   @xmath9 if and only if @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the limit set of the dynamical system : @xmath12 .    in this definition ,",
    "the limit set is not restricted to a fixed point .",
    "it can also be a limit cycle , an invariant torus , or a strange attractor .",
    "the function @xmath4 is thus a lyapunov function in its general sense .",
    "locally , positive lyapunov function @xmath4 implies the asymptotic orbital stability as stated in the next theorem .",
    "suppose the lyapunov function @xmath4 exists for a dynamical system : @xmath12 .",
    "suppose further that the limit set @xmath11 consists of a single trajectory : @xmath13 ; or the trajectory @xmath13 is dense in @xmath11 . in some neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath11 , if @xmath4 satisfies the condition :    a.   @xmath15 , for @xmath16 ,    then @xmath13 is asymptotically orbitally stable .",
    "globally , the convergence region can be extended by the lasalle invariance principle @xcite to a bounded simply - connected region : @xmath17 , satisfying : @xmath18 is differentiable and @xmath19 for any @xmath20 .",
    "notice that definition [ def : cand_lyapunov ] of lyapunov function @xmath4 has no requirement on the positiveness of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , unstable and saddle type limit sets can also be discussed within the current framework .",
    "in this paper , we will show the construction of lyapunov functions for a class of pls with saturation .",
    "the model being discussed emerges from nature and industry and is described as the following : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a saturation linear function acting on each entry of the vector @xmath23 @xmath24    this model quite generally describes the saturating feedback and exponential decay of many natural and technological systems .",
    "matrix @xmath25 in equation ( [ system ] ) determines the strength of the feedbacks and the structural properties of the network .",
    "when taking time - reversal , the system would be globally unstable . thus , attracting region problems will manifest @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be viewed as the linear differential inclusion ( ldi ) approximation of nonlinear systems with saturation .    to present our results ,",
    "we choose to be insightful rather than exhaustive .",
    "hence , we start with two dimensional cases that are @xmath26 rotational symmetric in phase space .",
    "such setting allows clear and simple presentation for the analysis of systems with limit cycle oscillations . under this setting , @xmath25 can be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 defined above represent two degrees of freedom that attracts our interest .",
    "these two degrees of freedom characterize symmetric and antisymmetric feedbacks , which are the two determinant components in oscillating systems .",
    "as will be discussed in section ( 5 ) , these two components each corresponds to a kind of bifurcation leading to the emergence of limit cycle bifurcation .",
    "the model system has the following different behaviors :    a.   when @xmath32 , there is a global stable fixed point in the phase space ; b.   when @xmath33 and @xmath34 , there are multiple stable fixed points , saddle points and an unstable fixed point ; c.   when @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the system has the behavior of limit cycle .    among previous works , piecewise qlf have been successfully applied in case ( a ) and ( b ) and provided stability measure for the system .",
    "therefore , we focus on constructing lyapunov functions in case ( c ) with limit cycle oscillation in the next section .",
    "we start to construct lyapunov functions for the pls with limit cycle when @xmath35 and @xmath36 , addressing a central problem posed by previous efforts mentioned in section ( 1 ) : to make lyapunov function totally continuous in the system s phase space , i.e. , lyapunov function in the neighboring linear regions should equal to each other on the region boundary .    for a system with only fixed points ,",
    "this continuity problem can be treated as a part of convex optimization problem by the piecewise quadratic lyapunov function approach .",
    "but for the system with limit cycle , this problem is essentially a periodic boundary condition problem .",
    "instead of solving a set of partial differential inequalities , we observe that the behavior near the limit set dominates the system s total behavior . therefore",
    ", the lyapunov function is constructed in the following three steps :    a.   first , set lyapunov function equal along the limit cycle of the system to meet the boundary condition in the neighborhood of the limit set . b.   second , use reparameterization to deform the lyapunov function in the linear regions where limit cycle pass through . after this step",
    ", the boundary condition is satisfied between regions containing the limit set . c.   third ,",
    "obtain a totally continuous lyapunov function by  gluing \" its expressions in all the linear regions with different limit sets together .",
    "the resulting lyapunov function is shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : construct ] and the regions are numbered from left to right , top to down ; labeling from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "since the whole system is set as @xmath26 rotationally symmetric for convenience , we only need to analyze three regions ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for example ) while the other ones are just a change of variables ( we can iteratively exchange @xmath42 for @xmath43 to get the expression of the lyapunov function for all the other regions ) . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we take as example the major cases where the limit cycle is contained in the regions : @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",

    ", we can set @xmath48 .. the case of @xmath49 can be directly obtained from solving the case : @xmath50 and changing @xmath51 for @xmath43 . ]    in every subsection that follows , we will first explain the method of construction , and then explicitly construct the lyapunov functions in the linear regions concerned .",
    "we first prove that the lyapunov function should be equal on the limit set ( see theorem ( [ theorem1 ] ) stated below ) .",
    "this theorem ensures the legitimacy of the first step of construction .    for lyapunov function @xmath4 defined on continuous dynamical system with limit sets , @xmath4 should be equal to a constant on each limit set.[theorem1 ]    the above theorem states that lyapunov function reflects the system s stability and convergence towards the limit set . at the same time , phase information in the neighborhood of the limit set would not be included in the lyapunov function .     to make lyapunov function equal on the limit cycle .",
    "white arrow indicates that step @xmath52 imposes the lyapunov function to satisfy the boundary condition on the limit cycle , as opposed to multiple qlf method .",

    "trajectory of the limit cycle @xmath11 can be calculated in each linear region of the system : @xmath53 . with the spatial variables @xmath54 and proper initial condition @xmath55 , we denote the trajectory as @xmath56    for the systems discussed in this paper , there can be a linear transformation of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and accordingly @xmath59 , @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 can separately have inverse functions with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , there are two functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 with the property : @xmath68 with this property , the above two functions can represent the phase information of the system in the neighborhood of the limit cycle @xmath11 . and note that : @xmath69 if and only if the state @xmath70 . we can construct function @xmath71 in region @xmath72 as : @xmath73 . here , @xmath74 is monotonic along the system s dynamics towards the center of the limit cycle @xmath11 , indicating a series of level curves ",

    "at first , when @xmath229 , the lyapunov function has multiple local minima . between the local minima , there are saddle points in the lyapunov function , forming barriers separating the phase space into multiple attracting regions . with the increase of @xmath31 ,",
    "barriers between attracting regions are lowered . when @xmath228 , at the critical value , the barriers decrease to zero , all the attracting regions are connected to one .",
    "four heteroclinic orbits connect to form the set : @xmath230 . and stability of the fixed points",
    "is lost . as @xmath31 continues to increase ,",
    "the limit cycle would be smoothed , allowing the speed of circulation on the limit cycle to increase .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : hopf ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : snip ] , we can observe the evolution of the lyapunov function corresponding to the bifurcation schemes and the changing vector fields .",
    "the continuous change of the lyapunov function during the bifurcation figuratively explains for the different mechanisms of hopf and snip bifurcation phenomena .",
    "the hopf bifurcation is essentially the change of stability of the central fixed point , a result of the symmetric feedback exceeding the exponential decay of the system . while snip bifurcation is caused by the increase of rotation effect in phase space , which links different attracting regions together .",
    "motivated by the need of lyapunov functions for complex pls with limit cycle oscillation , this paper provides a first example of constructive methodology in a class of pls .",
    "the approach constructs lyapunov functions in a class of piecewise linear models , tackling a central obstacle faced by previous efforts : to make lyapunov function of different linear regions continuous at the boundaries .",
    "the construction is completed within three steps : first , set the lyapunov function equal on the limit cycle ; second , use reparameterization to obtain continuous lypuanov function in linear regions containing the limit cycle ; third , glue all the linear regions together to have a totally continuous lyapunov function in phase space .",
    "the lyapunov function constructed in this way provides stability measure for the system in its entire phase space .",
    "moreover , the lyapunov functions provide a novel geometric point of view on control systems , containing stability measure and behavioral description of the systems dynamics .",
    "consequently , the change of lyapunov functions describes the evolution of the systems behaviors , explaining for the different factors causing hopf and snip bifurcations respectively .",
    "clearly , this effort can be extended to the general two dimensional dynamical systems with limit cycle oscillation . how the approach can be applied in higher dimensional systems with more complex behaviors",
    "is still an open problem with great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "recently , one of our works has shown the possibility of its application in chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "denote the positive trajectory of @xmath13 using its initial point : @xmath231 .",
    "suppose @xmath231 is the limit set @xmath11 ; or @xmath231 is dense in @xmath11 . then consider a neiborhood of @xmath11 : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is chosen so small that @xmath234 .",

    "a.   if the limit set is simply a fixed point @xmath252 , then @xmath253 , and @xmath254 . and",
