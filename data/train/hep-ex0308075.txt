    "measurements of the production of heavy quarks provide a wealth of information on high energy particle collisions . the mechanism for production of heavy quarks",
    "is governed by the strong force of nature which is described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . not only is qcd essential for understanding one of the four fundamental forces of nature , but many signatures of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) are dependent on precise knowledge of the rate of qcd processes , which are expected to form the most significant background .    the importance of a precise understanding of qcd is apparent when considering current and future accelerators .",
    "many of these accelerators will use protons and photons as the colliding particles , both of which have a hadronic structure and hence are described by qcd .",
    "figure  [ fig : feyn1](a ) shows a generic representation of the production of heavy quarks in a hadron - hadron collision .",
    "knowledge accumulated at hera , lep and the tevatron will directly benefit future programmes such as the lhc and a future linear collider where heavy quarks will be produced by the same mechanism .",
    "the produced partons then fragment into final - state hadrons which are measured in the detector as depicted in figure  [ fig : feyn1](b ) .",
    "the fragmentation procedure is usually described by non - perturbative models and is again an uncertainty common to all experiments .    _",

    "the production of heavy quarks is also _ directly _ sensitive to the gluon density in the colliding hadron ( see figure  [ fig : feyn1](a ) ) .",
    "the gluon density is usually determined in the dglap - evolution fits to measurements of structure functions in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "direct measurements of the gluon density provide an important check of these methods and the factorisation of the cross section .    in these proceedings ,",
    "results of open charm and beauty production from hera , the tevatron and @xmath0 collisions at lep are discussed . after a brief overview of theoretical and experimental aspects ,",
    "emphasis is given to understanding hadronic structure and the dynamics of the hard scatter .",
    "results on quarkonia and top production and measurements of @xmath4 fragmentation functions are discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for the generic collision , shown in figure  [ fig : feyn1 ] , of two hadrons producing heavy quarks , @xmath5 , the cross section can be written as a convolution of the parton densities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , of the two hadrons and the short - distance cross section , @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hadron s momentum fraction carried by the interacting parton and @xmath12 represents the renormalisation and factorisation scales .",
    "the short - distance cross section is a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath13 and the inverse mass of the heavy quark which implies faster convergence for larger masses .",
    "two different schemes and their combination are used for predictions of heavy - quark production . in the `` massive '' scheme , there are no heavy quarks in the colliding hadron and the predictions should be more accurate for transverse momenta @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , heavy quarks in the `` massless '' scheme are active in the colliding hadrons and the predictions should be more accurate for @xmath15 .",
    "the two schemes have recently been combined  @xcite such that predictions should be appropriate for all @xmath16 .",
    "the reconstruction of heavy quark mesons is similar in all experiments .",
    "signals for charm hadrons are generally observed by forming the invariant mass of the tracks identified with a specific decay channel , e.g. @xmath17 .",
    "if sufficiently accurate , a vertex detector can also be used to detect vertices displaced from the primary interaction point .",
    "an example of reconstructed @xmath18 mesons which uses both these techniques is shown in figure  [ fig : charms_tev](a ) from the cdf experiment  @xcite . to detect beauty quarks",
    ", the invariant mass of the decay products is also formed for a specific decay channel such as @xmath19 . as the decay length of beauty is longer than that for charm quarks , a vertex detector is a powerful tool for distinguishing beauty from the lighter quarks . the transverse momentum of an electron or muon relative to the direction of the parent quark",

    "measurements performed in a restricted kinematic region are often extrapolated to the full phase space using either a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation or monte carlo ( mc ) model .",
    "these extrapolations provide `` measurements '' of total cross sections or structure functions which are more intuitive and easy to compare between different experiments .",
    "they should , however , be treated with caution .",
    "the extrapolation is often performed to completely unmeasured regions , with factors as high as 20 and an uncertainty which is difficult to determine .",
    "measurements of the beauty cross section using tevatron run i data  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : b_tev_1 ] , provoked much of the current interest in the production rate of heavy quarks .",

    "significant theoretical development was made  @xcite to try and describe these data .",

    "this new `` fonll '' calculation also uses a new extraction of the fragmentation function of @xmath21 quarks to @xmath4 mesons as measured in an @xmath24 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the result of this new calculation is shown compared to the data in figure  [ fig : b_tev_1](b ) , where the difference between data and theory is reduced from a factor of 2.9 to 1.7 and consistency within the uncertainties is observed .      in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera ,",
