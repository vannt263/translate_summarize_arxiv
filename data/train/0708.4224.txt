    "interestingly , previous distance estimates for this object have produced somewhat conflicting results . using the measured k band magnitudes and extrapolating a k band absolute magnitude for a 8 myr brown dwarf ( from trends in song et al .",

    "( 2001 ) predict that the m8 dwarf should have a mass of 25 m@xmath8 and the companion should have a mass of @xmath75 m@xmath8 .",
    "mamajek ( 2005 ) estimates a theoretical moving cluster distance to 2m1207 of 53@xmath26 pc and infers masses for 2m1207a and b ( with an age of 8 myr ) of @xmath721 m@xmath8 and @xmath73 - 4 m@xmath8 respectively . from precision",

    "59@xmath27 pc , and hence similar masses .",
    "however , using these closer distance estimates , 2m1207a becomes underluminous and falls nearer the locus of the ( 120 myr ) pleiades on a color - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "1 )  which is inconsistent with an object age of @xmath010 myr at @xmath750 pc . recently",
    ", mamajek and meyer ( 2007 ) have revised the estimated theoretical moving cluster distance to 2m1207 to 66@xmath25 pc .",
    "thus , a direct distance measurement via parallax would help clarify this situation and additionally would constrain a number of important properties for this object .",
    "since the youth ( @xmath010 myr ) and hence low mass nature ( m@xmath013 m@xmath8 ) of 2m1207b has recently been confirmed , we have also measured the first accurate luminosity for a self - luminous planetary mass object .",
    "we have acquired 11 epochs of data stretching from january 2006 to april 2007 with andicam at the smarts 1.3 m telescope on cerro tololo .",
    "both 2m1207 and the standard object lhs 2397a ( an m8 dwarf with an l7.5 brown dwarf companion with a well known parallax of 62.3@xmath24.0 mas  tinney ( 1996 ) ) were observed for 40 minutes over transit .",
    "observations were repeated over multiple nights bracketing the new moon each month . over the entire observing period ,",
    "475 i band data frames with per frame exposure time of 300 s were acquired for 2 m 1207 and 491 i band data frames were acquired for lhs 2397a .",
    "the m8 primary of 2m1207 has i=15.8 ( scholz et al . 2005 ) so parallax can be determined in the visible .",
    "the l5 - 9.5 secondary of 2m1207 has k=16.9 ( chauvin et al .",
    "2004 ) , is even fainter in the visible ( i@xmath919 ) , and lies within 0.8 \" of its primary , thus it is essentially invisible to the 1.3 m in the optical ( and is not apparent in our images )",
    ". its presence does not affect our attainable astrometric precision .",
    "lhs 2397a is comparably bright as 2m1207 and was chosen as a standard object due to the fact that both are late m dwarf + mid to late l dwarf binaries ( freed et al .",
    "our measurement of the parallax of lhs 2397a ( previously found to be 62.3@xmath24.0 mas , tinney ( 1996 ) ) serves as a test of our observational and data reduction procedures .",
    "each target object was always placed at 82 pix e and 148 pix n of the center of the chip at pixel ( 330 , 660 ) .",
    "a number of bright stars lie right outside the lhs 2397a field ; we chose to place our target objects in the upper left quadrant of the chip as opposed to the center of the chip in order to keep these bright stars and their saturation bleeds off of the ccd .",
    "a dedicated parallax data analysis pipeline was used to reduce these data .",
    "this pipeline aligns each data frame to a master frame , removes cosmic rays , and performs psf fitting photometry for 139 stars per frame using the daophot allstar task ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the andicam optical detector is a fairchild 447 2048@xmath42048 ccd and was used in 2@xmath42 binning mode yielding a nominal platescale of 0.369 arcsec / pixel ( andicam website ) .",
    "five bright stars in different parts of the field were used to calibrate x and y plate scale changes on the ccd .",
    "the separations between the 5 platescale calibration stars were measured for each data frame and then normalized to the average value over all frames .",
    "these normalized values were used as frame by frame platescale corrections .",
    "we found platescale variations of less than 0.06@xmath10 over the @xmath71.5 year time baseline of our observations     the position of 2m1207 and lhs 2397a in ra and dec as a function of time is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : parallax ] .",
    "many reference stars as bright or brighter than the target are available in both the 2m1207 and lhs 2397a fields ; thus , we have a good distribution of baselines around both objects from which to calculate parallax .",
    "the position of 2m1207 and lhs 2397a were measured relative to 40 and 15 reference stars respectively .    to correct for a slightly variable x and y `` pincushion '' distortion ( first derivative of the x and y platescale ) on the chip , we measured the apparent motion on the sky for the 5 stars nearest 2m1207 on the chip .",
    "these stars are faint and likely significantly behind 2m1207 and thus presumed background so the motion observed for these should calibrate the local distortion of the chip near our target .",
    "two of these stars showed apparent space motions of their own and were thus discarded .",
    "the motions from the remaining three stars were then averaged together to create a first derivative platescale correction curve .",
    "this correction curve was then subtracted from the measured parallax curve for 2m1207 .",
    "a similar correction was also performed for the lhs 2397a data .    to determine the trigonometric parallax to 2m1207 and lhs 2397a , we fit ( least squares fit ) our measured parallax data to a parallax and proper motion model for each dataset .",
    "precise hst proper motions for 2m1207 of @xmath11 = -60.2@xmath24.9 mas / yr and @xmath12 = -25.0@xmath24.9 mas / yr were adopted from song et al .",
    "proper motions for lhs 2397a of @xmath11 = -508.0@xmath220.0 mas / yr and @xmath12 = -80.0@xmath220.0 mas / yr were adopted from salim @xmath13 gould ( 2003 ) .",
    "fits were performed both holding proper motion fixed and also fitting to proper motion ; for both 2m1207 and lhs 2397a we retrieve the published proper motions to within the published errors .",
    "we find that the error in published proper motion is negligible compared to per frame measurement errors .",
    "error in each nightly parallax measurement was calculated from the rms of measurements taken over that night .",
    "measurements from late 2006 ( 2006.9  2007.1 epoch ) were discarded since these data were taken off transit and thus suffer considerably from differential color refraction ( dcr , see , e.g. dahn et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in order to estimate the error in our trigonometric parallax measurement , a monte - carlo ensemble of 10000 datasets",
    "was simulated by multiplying our measured position errors by a random number distribution pulled from a gaussian distribution , then adding that random error to the measured position .",
    "an error - free trigonometric parallax model was then fitted and chi - square minimized to each of these simulated observations .",
    "the adopted distance is the mean of this 10000 simulated observation distribution of fits and the adopted error is the 1.28@xmath4 the standard deviation of this distribution , corresponding to an 80@xmath10 confidence interval .",

    "we estimate a correction from relative to absolute parallax of 1.2@xmath20.9 mas , based on i band photometry of 40 reference stars for 2m1207 and 15 reference stars for lhs 2397a .",
    "this correction was obtained by adopting an average spectral type of m0 for our relatively faint field reference stars ( i = 15 - 18 mag ) , calculating photometric parallaxes for each reference star and then employing the median photometric parallax of the reference stars as the estimated correction .",
    "for 2m1207ab , we acquired a best fit relative parallax of 15.8@xmath14 mas , corresponding to an absolute parallax of 17.0@xmath3 mas and a best fit distance of 58.8@xmath27.0 pc ( all 1.28@xmath1 errors ) . for our standard lhs 2397a",

    "2m1207b is somewhat redder ( j - k ) than field objects of the same spectral types .",

    "thus , our increase in distance does not resolve the issue of 2m1207b s underluminosity .    a number of reasons for the lower than expected luminosity of 2m1207b have been suggested .",
    "mohanty et al .",
    "2007 suggest that an edge - on disk around 2m1207b produces @xmath72.5 mag of gray extinction ( over jhk@xmath23l@xmath24 ) and hence , the observed low luminosity .",
    "mamajek and meyer ( 2007 ) suggest that 2m1207b may be a hot protoplanet collision remnant .",

    "the measured colors , absolute magnitudes ( jhk@xmath23l@xmath24 ) , and luminosity of 2m1207b are consistent with that of a 10 gyr 67 m@xmath8 object with l spectral type and t@xmath25=1500",
    ".    the culprit could simply be the initial conditions of the evolutionary models used to derive physical properties .",
    "marley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have noted that the `` hot - start '' evolutionary models for planets and brown dwarfs such as those from both the lyon and tucson groups ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 , burrows et al .",
    "2003 ) possess very high initial entropies and predict considerably brighter luminosities for young high mass planets than models which start with lower entropy initial conditions ( which may be more appropriate for planets which form via core accretion ) . for 4 - 10 m@xmath8 objects , the marley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) models converge with the standard evolutionary models by 100 myr .",
    "while 2m1207b most likely formed via fragmentation from a cloud core rather than core accretion or gravitational collapse within 2m1207a s small disk , the initial entropy conditions of its formation might have been considerably lower than those utilized by standard evolutionary models , producing a lower luminosity for each spectral type than expected at very young ages . in particular , inside a binary system , the initial entropy conditions may have been different , presumably lower , for a forming 8 m@xmath8 object interacting with a 30 m@xmath8 `` primary '' than for a 8 m@xmath8 object forming individually .",
    "mohanty et al . (",
    "2007 ) claim that the models are not the culprit for 2m1207b s underluminous nature , comparing it with the young , low mass brown dwarf ab pic b , whose colors , t@xmath25 , and luminosity agree well with the models",
    ". however , ab pic is somewhat older than 2m1207ab ( 30 myr vs. @xmath010 myr ) and has a much wider separation between components ( 250 au vs. 50 au ) , so it may have already converged to the standard evolutionary model tracks .",
    "we measured a distance of 58.8@xmath27.0 pc ( 17.0@xmath3 mas ) to 2m1207ab and a luminosity of 0.68 - 2.2@xmath410@xmath5 l@xmath6 for 2m1207b , making 2m1207ab a clear member of the tw hya cluster .",
