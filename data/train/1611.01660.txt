    "velocity and magnetic - field structure functions , which are moments of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the differences of fluid velocities and magnetic fields between two points separated by a distance @xmath0 ( a precise definition is given below ) , are often used to characterize the statistical properties of homogeneous , isotropic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence  @xcite . if @xmath0 is in the _ inertial range _ of scales that lie between the large length scale @xmath1 , at which energy is pumped into the system , and the fluid and magnetic dissipation scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , at which dissipation becomes significant , these structure functions scale as a power of @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the power - law behaviors of correlation functions at a critical point in , say , a spin system , as has been elucidated for _ equal - time _ structure functions in many papers : it turns out that the simple scaling we see at most critical points must be generalized to multiscaling in turbulence ; i.e. , an infinity of exponents is required to characterize the inertial - range behaviors of structure functions of different orders as discussed , e.g. , for fluid turbulence in ref .",

    "the scaling behaviors of correlation functions at a critical point  @xcite arise from the divergence of a correlation length @xmath4 at the critical point : in a simple spin system @xmath5 if the magnetic field @xmath6 , where the reduced temperature @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the temperature , @xmath9 the critical temperature , and @xmath10 is an equal - time critical exponent that is universal ( in a given universality class ) . in the vicinity of a critical point the relaxation time @xmath11 , which follows from _ time - dependent _ correlation functions , scales , according to the _ dynamic - scaling ansatz _ , as @xmath12 @xmath13 is known as the dynamic - scaling exponent .",
    "there has been considerable progress  @xcite in developing the analog of such a dynamic - scaling _ ansatz _ for _ time - dependent _ structure functions in homogeneous , isotropic fluid turbulence . in this paper",
    "we present the first study of time - dependent structure functions in mhd turbulence .",
    "we first set up the formalism in the framework of the 3d mhd equations and then carry out explicit numerical studies of a shell model for 3d mhd turbulence  @xcite .",
    "we show that ( a ) an infinity of dynamic - multiscaling exponents is required and ( b ) that these exponents depend on the precise way in which times , e.g. , the integral - time scales ( defined below ) , are extracted from time - dependent structure functions .    since the work of obukhov  @xcite , desnyansky and novikov  @xcite , and gledzer , and ohkitani and yamada  @xcite ( goy ) , shell models have been used to study the multiscaling of velocity structure functions in fluid turbulence  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of these models have been used to study magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence  @xcite , hall - mhd turbulence  @xcite , the effects of polymer additives on fluid turbulence  @xcite , two - dimensional fluid turbulence  @xcite and turbulence in between two and three dimensions  @xcite , turbulence in rotating systems  @xcite and in binary - fluid mixtures  @xcite , superfluid turbulence  @xcite , and the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions in fluid  @xcite and passive - scalar  @xcite turbulence .",
    "it behooves us , therefore , to examine first the dynamic multiscaling of structure functions in a shell model for three - dimensional mhd ( 3d mhd ) .    in fluid and passive - scalar turbulence ,",

    "linear bridge relations _ to equal - time multiscaling exponents  @xcite ; we have not been able to find such relations for mhd turbulence so far .",

    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : eqsf ] contains an introduction to the 3d mhd equations and the multiscaling of equal - time magnetic and fluid structure functions .",
    "section  [ sec : dm ] is devoted to a discussion of the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions in fluid turbulence , in general , and 3d mhd turbulence , in particular . in section  [ sec : shell ] we describe a shell model for 3d mhd turbulence and give the details of our numerical studies of this model .",

    "we see rather clean inertial - range scaling for both these quantities ; and from numerical fits we obtain the dynamic multiscaling exponents @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the mean values of these exponents are obtained from @xmath53 different sets of statistically independent data ; the mean of these is quoted as the exponent and their standard deviation as the error bar .",

    "unfortunately , this way of obtaining bridge relations can not be generalized to the case of mhd turbulence : we must now deal with a joint multifractal distribution of both the velocity and the magnetic - field variables . to obtain the analogs of the fluid - turbulence bridge relations given above",
    ", additional decoupling approximations must be made for averages of products of powers of velocity and magnetic - field increments ; such approximations have been used to obtain bridge relations for the case of passive - scalar turbulence  @xcite . however , it is not possible to justify such additional decoupling approximations for the case of mhd turbulence because the magnetic field is actively advected by the fluid and , in turn , affects the advecting velocity field .     versus the wave - vector for @xmath50 = 1.0 .",

    "spatiotemporal correlation or structure functions are important measures by which we probe the statistical properties of turbulent flows , which arise from the dynamics and the coupling of the multiple spatial and temporal scales .",
    "we have developed the formalism for exploring the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions that characterize mhd turbulence .",
    "such dynamic multiscaling has been studied hitherto only for fluid and passive - scalar turbulence .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out extensive numerical studies of such time - dependent structure functions in a shell model for 3d mhd turbulence  @xcite and thus shown that an infinity of dynamic - multiscaling exponents is required to characterize the multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that these exponents depend on the precise way in which time scales are extracted from these structure functions .",
    "the measurement of two - point , spatiotemporal fluctuations , via time - dependent structure functions and their associated scaling exponents  @xcite , is a challenging numerical task , especially if quasi - lagrangian structure functions have to be obtained from direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of hydrodynamical equations , as has been done for fluid turbulence in two and three dimensions  @xcite . given current computational resources , it is best to begin with shell - model studies , which have very special advantages compared to quasi - lagrangian dnss .",
    "apart from the enormous range in reynolds number that we can cover in shell models , the basic quasi - lagrangian structure of shell models helps to eliminate trivial dynamic scaling , which arises because of the sweeping effect that we have discussed above",
    ".    given recent advances in observational techniques for space plasmas and the solar winds  @xcite , we expect that direct measurements of time - dependent structure functions should be possible in these systems . our study of these structure functions in mhd turbulence is directly relevant to such experiments .",
    "it is important to realize the importance of such a calculation within the framework of shell models .",
    "for example , a recent shell - model study of hall - mhd turbulence has provided an explanation of the spectral properties of turbulence in the solar wind  @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations of the mhd - shell - model equations are several orders of magnitude longer than those in earlier studies  @xcite and our reynolds numbers are much higher than those achieved there . given that the mhd system is considerably more complicated than its navier - stokes counterpart , it is not surprising that it is much harder to characterize dynamic multiscaling in the former than it is in the latter from _ both theoretical and numerical points of view_. as we have mentioned above , we can not obtain for mhd turbulence the analogs of bridge relations  @xcite , which relate equal - time and dynamic - multiscaling exponents in fluid and passive - scalar turbulence .",
    "the exploration of dynamic multiscaling for the full mhd equations , via quasi - lagrangian approaches  @xcite , remains a challenge .    in the case of previous shell - model studies of fluid and passive - scalar turbulence ,",
    "it has been possible to extract , additionally the derivative - time - scale and the associated scaling exponents for the same  @xcite .",
