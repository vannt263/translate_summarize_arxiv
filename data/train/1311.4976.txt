    "compressed sensing and quantum tomography are two disparate scientific fields .",
    "the fast developing field of compressed sensing provides innovative data acquisition techniques and supplies efficient accurate reconstruction methods for recovering sparse signals and images from highly undersampled observations [ see @xcite ] .",
    "its wide range of applications include signal processing , medical imaging and seismology .",
    "the problems to solve in compressed sensing often involve large data sets with complex structures such as data on many variables or features observed over a much smaller number of subjects . as a result ,",
    "the developed theory of compressed sensing can shed crucial insights on high - dimensional statistics .",
    "matrix completion , a current research focus point in compressed sensing , is to reconstruct a low rank matrix based on under - sampled observations .",
    "trace regression is often employed in noisy matrix completion for low rank matrix estimation .",
    "recently several methods were proposed to estimate a low rank matrix by minimizing the squared residual sum plus some penalty .",
    "the penalties used include nuclear - norm penalty [ cands and plan ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite ] , rank penalty [ @xcite and @xcite ] , the von neumann entropy penalty [ @xcite ] , and the schatten - p quasi - norm penalty [ @xcite ] .",
    "contemporary scientific studies often rely on understanding and manipulating quantum systems .",
    "examples include quantum computation , quantum information and quantum simulation [ @xcite and wang ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "the studies particularly frontier research in quantum computation and quantum information stimulate great interest in and urgent demand on quantum tomography .",
    "a  quantum system is described by its state , and the state is often characterized by a complex matrix on some hilbert space .",
    "the matrix is called density matrix .",
    "a density matrix used to characterize a quantum state usually grows exponentially with the size of the quantum system . for the study of a quantum system ,",
    "it is important but very difficult to know its state .",
    "if we do not know in advance the state of the quantum system , we may deduce the quantum state by performing measurements on the quantum system .",
    "in statistical terminology , we want to estimate the density matrix based on measurements performed on a large number of quantum systems which are identically prepared in the same quantum state . in the quantum literature , quantum state tomography refers to the reconstruction of the quantum state based on measurements obtained from measuring identically prepared quantum systems .    in this paper , we investigate statistical relationship between quantum state tomography and noisy matrix completion based on trace regression .",
    "trace regression is used to recover an unknown matrix from noisy observations on the trace of the products of the unknown matrix and matrix input variables .",
    "its connection with quantum state tomography is through quantum probability on quantum measurements .",
    "consider a finite - dimensional quantum system with a density matrix . according to the theory of quantum physics ,",
    "when we measure the quantum system by performing measurements on observables which are hermitian ( or self - adjoint ) matrices , the measurement outcomes for each observable are real eigenvalues of the observable , and the probability of observing a particular eigenvalue is equal to the trace of the product of the density matrix and the projection matrix onto the eigen - space corresponding to the eigenvalue , with the expected measurement outcome equal to the trace of the product of the density matrix and the observable .",
    "taking advantage of the connection @xcite has applied matrix completion methods with nuclear norm penalization to quantum state tomography for reconstructing low rank density matrices . as trace regression and quantum state tomography share the common goal of recovering the same matrix parameter",
    ", we naturally treat them as two statistical models in the le cam paradigm and study their asymptotic equivalence via le cam s deficiency distance . here",
    "equivalence means that each statistical procedure for one model has a corresponding equal - performance statistical procedure for another model .",
    "the equivalence study motivates us to introduce a new fine scale trace regression model .",
    "we derive bounds on the deficiency distances between trace regression and quantum state tomography with summarized measurement data and between fine scale trace regression and quantum state tomography with individual measurement data , and then under suitable conditions we establish asymptotic equivalence of trace regression and quantum state tomography for both cases .",
    "the established asymptotic equivalence provides a sound statistical foundation for applying matrix completion procedures to quantum state tomography under appropriate circumstances .",
    "we further analyze the asymptotic equivalence of trace regression and quantum state tomography for sparse matrices and low rank matrices .",
    "the detailed analyses indicate that the asymptotic equivalence does not require sparsity nor low rank on matrix parameters , and depending on the density matrix class as well as the set of observables used for performing measurements , sparsity and low rank may or may not make the asymptotic equivalence easier to achieve . in particular , we show that the pauli matrices as observables are bad for establishing the asymptotic equivalence for sparse matrices and low rank matrices ; and for certain class of sparse or low rank density matrices , we can obtain the asymptotic equivalence of quantum state tomography and trace regression in the ultra high dimension setting where the matrix size of the density matrices is comparable to or even exceeds the number of the quantum measurements on the observables .    the rest of paper proceeds as follows .",
