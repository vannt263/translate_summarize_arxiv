    "the electromagnetic response of high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htcs ) in the mixed state is of great interest for fundamental physics as well as for technological applications ( e.g. pickup coils for magnetic resonance imaging,@xcite filters@xcite ) . in particular , controlling vortex pinning is essential to reduce power dissipation and signal noise in devices , whereas intrinsic macroscopic quantities such as the viscous drag coefficient are intimately related to the electronic states of vortex cores , and thus yield a great deal of information about the latter.@xcite it is then desirable to obtain accurate and reliable determinations of the vortex parameters from experimental data . as a matter of fact , however , in htcs the estimates of the vortex parameters span orders of magnitude , even when similar compounds are measured.@xcite the htcs vortex dynamics is notoriously very complex.@xcite thus , the determination of the vortex parameters from the experimental data is not straightforward ( to say the least ) . among the others , vortex - vortex interactions , which give rise to non - local response,@xcite and disorder @xcite",
    "play a fundamental role . as a consequence",
    ", the response of the vortex system can attain very complex frequency dependencies even in the linear regime of small currents . in those cases , it is rather difficult to reliably determine ( or even define ) the vortex parameters .",
    "a substantial simplification comes by increasing the stimulus frequency to sufficiently high values , e.g. to the microwave range . in this case",
    "the amplitude of the vortex oscillations becomes so small@xcite that the system can be treated in the local , single vortex limit . in this scenario a single - vortex , mean - field approach is usually profitably exploited to determine the vortex parameters,@xcite@xmath1@xcite such as the viscous drag coefficient , the depinning frequency , the pinning constant",
    ". mean field models have been often extended with the introduction of field - dependent effective vortex parameters in order to account for inhomogeneities and finite elasticity of the vortex system.@xcite mean field models can also be generalized rather easily to include the screening effects and the interactions between the microwave current and moving vortices.@xcite as a matter of fact , most experiments concerning the mixed - state electrodynamic properties in the microwave range make use of mean - field models for the interpretation of the data and for the determination of the physics of the vortex matter .    due to the complexity of microwave measurements , high sensitivity is usually obtained by using resonating techniques,@xcite while wideband measurements ( e.g. corbino disk,@xcite bolometry @xcite ) are confined to small temperature regions .",
    "thus , one has to deal with single - frequency measurements .",
    "discussion of such measurements in terms of vortex parameters is only seemingly straightforward .",
    "in fact , it is quite delicate because the choice of the specific model can deeply influence the figures which can be extracted , since a different dynamics ( i.e. , frequency dependence ) of the data with respect to the model adopted can significantly vary the estimates of the vortex parameters ( a discussion , in a different context , is given in refs . ) .",
    "an example is given in ref .",
    ", which presents measurements on nb films : the flux flow resistivity as calculated from the data displays very different field dependencies whether the pinning contribution is taken into account or not .",
    "another example , specific to htcs , is discussed in the review of ref .",
    ": there , it is shown that estimates of the viscous drag coefficient can vary up to two orders of magnitudes whether pinning effects are included or not .",
    "in addition to those remarks , one has to note that in htcs thermal creep is unavoidable , at least above @xmath2 : without a proper data treatment , the use of even the simplest vortex models would pose serious questions on the reliability of the estimates of the vortex parameters .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that the reliability of the determination of the vortex parameters from experimental data , and an evaluation of their model - dependence , is an important issue before those parameters can be compared to microscopic theories .",
    "the fact that in most models the number of parameters exceeds the number of independently measured observables further complicates the problem .    in this paper",
    "we intend to address the issue of a correct and reliable determination of the vortex parameters based on typical microwave measurements . in so doing , we will show first that many mean - field models can be reduced to a universal expression for the vortex resistivity .",
    "we will use this result to discuss the model - independence of the vortex parameters .",
    "second , by exploiting physical and algebraical properties of the models for the vortex complex resistivity , we will show that many additional information , including creep , can be extracted with respect to standard analysis .",
    "finally , we will apply the novel , extended analysis to some illustrative example .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : models ] we briefly recall the main mean field models for the vortex motion , with emphasis on their common features and differences , and we rewrite the resulting expressions for the complex resistivity in a single formulation .",
    "simple numerical examples are used to illustrate the lack of robustness of the derivation of the vortex parameters with respect to different models . in section [ sec : analysis ] selected data of the microwave magneto - resistivity in the mixed state of some htcs thin films , tl@xmath3ba@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( tbcco ) and yba@xmath3cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) , are discussed in detail in the light of the previous section , to exemplify the proposed extended analysis .",
    "the results arising from the application of different models are discussed . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize the results and prospect future work .",
    "the appendices report most of the details of the calculations .",
    "in this section we consider the complex vortex resistivity @xmath7 as calculated within mean field models .",
    "we focus on the local response of the fluxon system . in this case",
    ", the surface impedance @xmath8 can be derived when needed by properly taking into account the geometry of the sample and of the experiment.@xcite we specifically discuss the common case where the microwave currents flow in the isotropic plane [ @xmath9 plane , in cuprates ] of a uniaxial anisotropic superconductor , and the static magnetic induction field @xmath10 is perpendicular to the plane of isotropy and to the alternate currents .",
    "the vortex motion resistivity @xmath7 relates the alternate current density @xmath11 to the electric field @xmath12 induced by the moving vortices .",
    "when the vortex displacement is sufficiently small to ensure the validity of the local limit , e.g. with increasing the driving frequency , the vortex velocity @xmath13 is customarily determined by writing down the dynamic equation for the balance of forces ( per unit length ) exerted on a single vortex:@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit vector along the vortex and @xmath16 is the flux quantum .",
    "the overall current density @xmath11 exerts the lorentz force @xmath17 .",
    "thermal fluctuations give rise to the stochastic force @xmath18 , responsible for fluxon jumps between pinning sites .",
    "power dissipation of moving vortices is represented by the drag force @xmath19 , where the viscous drag coefficient @xmath20 is related to the relaxation processes of the quasiparticles.@xcite thus , it is a quantity essentially connected to the microscopic electronic state .",
    "the viscous drag coefficient @xmath20 , which is also commonly referred to as vortex viscosity , is not to be confused with the vortex fluid viscosity discussed in ref . and there denoted with the same symbol @xmath20 .",

    "thus , one approximates @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pinning constant ( also indicated as the labusch parameter @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the vortex displacement .",
    "this force is the result of single interactions between pins and vortices , of collective interaction of the ensemble of pins and the vortex matter , and of the fluxon system elasticity itself . as such",
    ", it is clear that it contains much of the physics of the vortex matter .    in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "the balance of the various forces acting on a moving vortex is strongly frequency dependent .",
    "an important characteristic frequency is the so - called ( de)pinning angular frequency @xmath32 , which marks the crossover between elastic motion , dominant at lower frequencies , from purely dissipative motion , arising at higher frequencies .",
    "the role of vortex mass is a longstanding issue , @xcite that seems far from an accepted solution . accordingly to most estimates , @xcite in the following we will neglect the vortex mass for the microwave frequency range we are interested in .",
    "equation is the starting point for many models .",
    "different expressions of @xmath7 have been derived depending on the specific physics incorporated in the various terms of eq .. as important examples , the inclusion of finite vortex elasticity and/or collective pinning phenomena through properly defined field dependent pinning parameters@xcite yielded to a much wider application of eq ..    in the following , we briefly recall several specific models for the vortex resistivity , and we show that all can be reduced to a single analytic expression .",
