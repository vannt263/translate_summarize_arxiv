    "the recently developed theory @xcite on chaos in partial differential equations has the greatest potential of significance in its abundant applications in science and engineering .",
    "the variety of the specific problems also stimulates innovation of the theory . in these representative publications @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , two categories of the theory were developed .",
    "the category developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite involves transversal homoclinic orbits , and a shadowing technique is used to prove the existence of chaos .",
    "this category is very complete .",
    "the category in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite deals with silnikov ( non - transversal ) homoclinic orbits , and a geometric construction of smale horseshoes is employed .",
    "this category is not very complete .",
    "the main machineries for locating homoclinic orbits are ( 1 ) .",
    "darboux transformations , ( 2 ) .",
    "isospectral theory , ( 3 ) .",
    "persistence of invariant manifolds and fenichel fibers , ( 4 ) .",
    "melnikov analysis and shooting technique .",
    "overall , the two categories of the theory on chaos in partial differential equations can be regarded as a new development at the intersection among integrable theory , dynamical system theory , and partial differential equations @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will apply the above chaos theory to study the chaotic flux dynamics in a long josephson junction .",
    "a josephson junction consists of three parts : two superconductors separated by a thin ( @xmath0  ) dielectric barrier .",
    "the main character of a josephson junction is that it behaves as a single superconductor . in particular , electric flux",
    "called fluxons can travel through the dielectric barrier through josephson tunneling .",
    "in general , the scenario is as follows : when two superconductors are separated by a macroscopic distance , their phases can change independently .",
    "as the two superconductors are moved closer to about @xmath1   separation , quasiparticles can flow from one superconductor to the other by means of single electron tunneling .",
    "when the separation is reduced to @xmath2  , cooper pairs can flow from one superconductor to the other ( josephson tunneling ) . in this case",
    ", phase correlation is realized between the two superconductors , and the whole josephson junction behaves as a single superconductor .",
    "this phenomenon was predicted by brian josephson in 1962 @xcite .",
    "it has significant applications in quantum - mechanical circuits .",
    "the governing equations are @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the voltage and current across the josephson junction , @xmath6 is the phase difference between the wave functions in the two superconductors , the constant @xmath7 is called the critical current , and the constant @xmath8 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "interesting simple phenomena can be observed from the above governing equations , e.g. when @xmath4 is constant @xmath9 in @xmath10 , @xmath6 is linear in @xmath10 , then the current @xmath5 will be an ac current with amplitude @xmath7 and frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this shows that a josephson junction can be a perfect voltage - to - frequency converter .",
    "significant applications of a josephson junction can be found in many areas , e.g. in medicine for measurement of small currents in the brain and the heart .",
    "josephson junction may also provide key ingredients for future quantum computers . for more details on the physics of the josephson junction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "when a josephson junction has one or more dimensions longer than the rest , i.e. a long josephson junction ( ljj ) , the phase difference @xmath6 is also a function of spatial coordinates along the longer dimensions . in this article",
    ", we will focus on one longer dimension case .",
    "it is well known that the flux dynamics in a long josephson junction ( ljj ) is described by the so - called perturbed sine - gordon equation @xcite @xmath12 where again @xmath6 is the phase difference between the two superconductors , and @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "the above equation is the rescaled standard form . in dealing with real junctions",
    ", one must take into account losses , bias , and junction irregularities which influence the flux dynamics @xcite .",
    "are of perturbation nature , and accounted for by the term @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the perturbation parameter . different forms of @xmath14 can even by set up in experiments .",
    "typically @xmath14 takes the following forms :    * @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents shunt loss and @xmath18 represents dc current bias @xcite . *",
    "@xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents longitudinal loss @xcite .",
    "* @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents ac current bias @xcite . *",
    "@xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents ac current field @xcite @xcite .",
    "* @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents spatially periodic current field @xcite .",
    "of course , many other forms of @xmath14 can also be set up in experiments .",
    "there is an abundant literature on long josephson junctions , for a sample , see @xcite .",
    "travelling wave solutions of ( [ psg ] ) satisfy an ordinary differential equation which had been studied numerically since as early as 1968 by johnson @xcite using an analog - digital computer , till most recently @xcite via analytical and numerical tools .    in this article , we shall study the full partial differential equation .",
    "when @xmath27 , equation ( [ psg ] ) is the well - known sine - gordon equation .",
    "two well - known types of solutions to the sine - gordon equation are the kink and breather solutions .",
    "the simplest kink solution is independent of the space variable @xmath28 .",
    "such a simple kink can be observed in experiemnts for josephson junctions . as @xmath29 , the kink @xmath30 approaches e.g. @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in terms of the current and voltage ( @xmath33 ) mentioned above",
    ", this corresponds to a closed loop  named a vortex or a fluxon . in the infinite dimensional phase space setting of the current article , this simple kink also represents a heteroclinic orbit .",
    "a breather oscillates periodically in time ( breathing ) and decays in space ( @xmath34 ) . in our current setting ,",
    "we switch the space and time , therefore , the breather is now spatially periodic and temporally homoclinic , i.e. a homoclinic orbit . for long josephson junctions ,",
    "spatial dependence is significant , dynamics beyond the simple kink becomes crucial .",
    "more sophisticated solutions incorporating both the kink and the breather have been constructed @xcite . in the phase space , these represent heteroclinic orbits which depend on both time and space .",
    "together , these heteroclinic orbits form a two - dimensional heteroclinic cycle .",
    "the current article will focus its study on the neighborhood of this heteroclinic cycle .",
    "three main topics will be covered .",
    "the first is chaotic flux dynamics and its prediction via melnikov integrals ( sections 4,5,6 ) .",
    "the second is on the components of the global attractor and the bifurcation in the perturbation parameter ( section 7 ) .",
    "the third is ratchet effect ( section 8) .",
    "section 9 is the conclusion .",
    "we pose periodic boundary condition on the above perturbed sine - gordon equation ( [ psg ] ) , @xmath35 this boundary condition corresponds to an annular ljj @xcite @xcite .",
    "convenient for mathematical studies , a more restricted condition  the even constraint may be imposed @xmath36 which corresponds to a mirror symmetry of the annular ljj .",
