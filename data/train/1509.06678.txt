    "there are a number of methods that can be used to consistently include non - linear structures in cosmological models .",
    "the most well - known of these is probably the `` swiss cheese '' approach , in which spherically symmetric solutions are joined to homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker geometries@xcite ( see fig . [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to take regions of perturbed minkowski space , and join them together at reflection symmetric boundaries@xcite ( see fig . [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "the former of these approaches has the benefit of admitting exact solutions . the latter benefits from admitting space - times with reduced symmetry , and from removing the regions of locally homogeneous and isotropic space - time entirely .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    in the context of einstein s theory , the swiss cheese and lattice models can be used to elucidate the links between the gravitational fields of non - linear structures , and those of the cosmological models within which they reside . they show that the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations are entirely compatible with the coulomb - like gravitational fields that are expected on small scales .",
    "one does not restrict the other . in this paper",
    "we will consider the corresponding situation in the @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
    "we will reach quite different conclusions in this case .",
    "the @xmath0 theories of gravity are a generalisation of einstein s theory of gravity .",
    "they are defined by replacing the ricci scalar , @xmath1 , in the einstein - hilbert action , with some function , @xmath0 .",
    "variation with respect to the metric then gives the following set of field equations : [ fes ] g _",
    "= + , where subscript @xmath1 denotes a derivative with respect to that quantity , and where @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields ( defined in the usual way ) . these equations are fourth order in derivatives of the metric , and if one want to join together two space - times then the following conditions@xcite are required for their union to be a solution of eq .",

    "the brackets @xmath8^+_-$ ] denote the difference in a quantity when evaluated on either side of the boundary , and we have assumed here that there are no surface layers ( _ i.e. _ there are no @xmath9-function matter fields on the boundary ) .",
    "the first three of these equations are the same as required by einstein s theory ( up to a factor of @xmath10 ) , while the last two are new .",
    "these latter equations constitute additional requirements that a geometry must obey , in order to be a solution of the field equations .    in much of the analysis reported here , we will us a post - newtonian appoximation to describe weak gravitational fields in the presence on non - linear structures . the leading - order part of the perturbed metric is then given by ds^2 -(1 - 2 ) dt^2 + ( 1 + 2 ) _",
    "ij dx^i dx^j , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be interpreted as gravitational potentials .",
    "the taylor series approximation to theories that can be expanded around @xmath13 is then given by [ anal ] f(r ) = f(0 ) + f_r(0 ) r + f_rr(0 ) r^2 + o(r^3 ) . if we take @xmath14 , then the gravitational potentials become@xcite [ anal2 ] = ( + f_rr r ) = ( u - f_rr r ) , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath1 are functions that satisfy @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the reader will note that the first two of these potentials are exactly the same as the potentials that result from solving einstein s equations with a cosmological constant ( where @xmath20 takes the place of the usual symbol @xmath21 ) .",
    "the ricci scalar , @xmath1 , plays the role of an additional yukawa potential .",
    "let us first consider swiss cheese constructions , in theories that can be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ anal ] ) .",
    "if we model the region around a point - like mass using the post - newtonian approximation , discussed above , then an application of the junction conditions in eq .",
    "( [ jc1 ] ) tells us that the radius of the vacuole that surrounds it must obey@xcite @xmath22 where the boundary is at coordinate distance @xmath23 from the centre of the vacuole , and where @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "the first two terms in each of these equations behave in the same way as the contributions from dust and @xmath21 in the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) behaves in the same way as a spatial curvature term , and the last terms in eqs .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) and ( [ sc2 ] ) have no counterparts in the solutions of einstein s equations .    in we now impose the remaining junction conditions , from eq .",
    "( [ jc2 ] ) , then we see that @xmath25 on the boundary , such that the last terms in each of eqs .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) and ( [ sc2 ] ) must vanish . recall that these are the only two terms that show any difference from the solutions of einstein s equations , and one",
    "is led to the conclusion that the only swiss cheese models that can be constructed within this class of theories are ones that expand at leading order in a way that is identical to the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations with @xmath21 .",
    "this is a strong restriction , imposed on the large - scale expansion simply by demanding that the theory have a well - defined post - newtonian limit in the vicinity of point - like masses .",
    ".    the lattice models , while mathematicall and conceptually quite different from the swiss chees models , display a remarkable similarity in the final result of their construction . in this case",
    "it can be shown , as a result of both the field equations and the junction conditions , that the position of the boundary must satisfy@xcite , where here the boundary is taken to be at coordinate distance @xmath26 from the centre of the lattice cell .",
    "this is again for theories that can be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ anal ] ) .",
    "the right - hand side of the equation above takes the same form as the source terms in the friedmann solutions of einstein s equation in the presence of dust and @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore have the same result as before : the only large - scale expansion that is possible , in the leading - order behaviour of these constructions , is identical to that of the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations with @xmath21 .",
    "the results derived so far seem quite limiting , but one might question whether they are a result of assuming the theory can be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ anal ] ) .",
    "another possiblity is to consider non - analytic functions , where this is not possible .",
    "the simplest of these would be theories with @xmath27 .",
    "exact solutions for point - masses surrounded by spherically symetric vacua have been found in refs .   & .",
    "a static vacuum solution is given by@xcite [ e1 ] ds^2 = -a_1(r ) dt^2 + + r^2 ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) , where @xmath28 a non - static solution , on the other hand , also exists , and is given by@xcite [ e2 ] ds^2 = -a_2(r ) dt^2 + t^ b_2(r ) ( dr^2 + r^2 ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) ) , where @xmath29 the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 that appear in these equations are both arbitrary constants .",
    "the only other remaining quantitiy is @xmath32 .    although the weak - field limit of these non - analytic theories is cumbersome to probe , these exact solutions can be used to try and construct swiss cheese models .",
    "if one attempts this , however , then one finds that no such constructions are possible@xcite .",
    "the junction conditions across the boundary can not be satisfied unless @xmath33 , which reduces the theory to that of einstein .",
    "this is true for the geometry described in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , and the geometry described in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "it is also true of the schwarzschild solution , which is often another solution of the field equations of @xmath0 theories .",
    "the only exception to this latter case is if @xmath0 is linear in @xmath1 , which is again just the einstein equations with @xmath21 .",
    "so , once again , we find that the only large - scale expansion that is possible is the same as that prescribed by the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "another family of theories that can not be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ anal ] ) are those considered in refs . , & .",
    "these theories have attracted a lot of attention in the cosmology community , so it seems well worth investigating them within the current context .",
    "we start by expanding the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath10 in terms of their order - of - smallness in the post - newtonian expansion .",
    "this gives f= f^(0 ) + f^(2 ) + o(^4 ) f_r = f_r^(0 ) + f_r^(2 ) + o(^4 ) , where superscripts in brackets denote the order of a quantity in @xmath35 , which is the post - newtonian expansion parameter .",
    "this is exactly the way that the weak - field limit of these theories is usually treated .",
    "if one now tries to build one of the constructions we considered earlier , then one is immediately led to the following@xcite : [ first ] f^(0 ) = 0 f_r^(0 ) = q(t ) , where @xmath36 is an , as yet unspecified , function of time only .",
    "this leads us to consider two possible classes of theory :    * class i : * these are theories in which @xmath37constant .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath38 in this class , where @xmath39 .",
    "* class ii : * these are theories in which @xmath40 constant .",
    "this requires @xmath41 , as @xmath42 .",
    "for this to be true implies @xmath1 is a function of time only .",
    "let us consider each of these classes separately :    this class of theories contains all of those considered in refs .",
    ", & . in this case",
    "the field equations ( [ fes ] ) and junction conditions ( [ jc1 ] ) give@xcite [ classi ] = ( + f_r ) = ( u- f_r ) , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and where @xmath45 constant .",
    "the reader can once again note that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 functions are exactly as one would expect from the solutions of einstein s equations with a cosmological constant ( where @xmath46 now plays the role of what is usually denoted @xmath21 ) .",
    "the only possible new behaviour comes the the terms containing @xmath47 , which must obey@xcite ^2 f_r = r + f(0 ) - . if , however , we impose the junction conditions from eq .",
    "( [ jc2 ] ) , then it can be seen that the normal derivative of @xmath47 must vanish on the boundary .",
    "this means that the extra terms in eq .",
    "( [ classi ] ) can not contribute to the motion of the boundary .",
    "we therefore find , once again , that the only possible large - scale expansion is indistinguishable from that found in the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations with @xmath21 .",
    "the leading - order part of @xmath1 , in all theories in this class , must be a function of time only .",
    "this immediately implies that the leading - order part of @xmath48 must also be a function of time only , as @xmath49 .",
    "if this is true , it is straightforward to show the post - newtonian parameter @xmath50 must be given by@xcite = .",
    "this is strongly inconsistent with observational bounds , and occurs because the fifth - force that occurs in this class of @xmath0 theories can not be screened by the chameleon mechanism .",
    "this can be seen from the equation of motion of the effective scalar degree of freedom , which is given by ^2 f_r^(2 ) = - + homogeneous terms .",
    "there does not exist sufficient freedom to create a non - trivial potential for @xmath51 in this expression , and so the fifth - force goes un - screened .",
    "this means that all theories within this class , while potentially admitting interesting new cosmological behaviour , can not be considered observationally viable .",
    "we find that , in the presence of non - linear structure , the observationally viable theories we have studied all evolve on large scale like the friedmann solutions of einstein s equations with @xmath21 .",
    "we also note that the oscillatory behaviour that is generically present in the friedmann solutions of many of these @xmath0 theories@xcite appears to be supressed .",
    "this indicates that either the weak - field limit of these theories is destroyed when the oscillations occur , or that the existence of non - linear structures prevents the oscillations from occuring at all .",
    "whatismore , in every viable case , the effective cosmological constant that emerges must be constructed from constant parameters that appear linearly at lowest order in the gravitational lagrangian ( _ i.e. _ just like @xmath21 does ) .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that these theories do not solve any of the problems associated with the cosmological constant , and hence that the difficulties created by introducing a new light degree of freedom on small scales have no obvious benefit ."
