    "elastic production of vector mesons in electron - proton interaction has provided a deeper understanding of the diffraction phenomenon and finds a sensible description in a variety of models .",
    "the first attempts to describe diffractive photoproduction were based on regge theory  @xcite and vector dominance model  @xcite . since various aspects of the deep inelastic scattering and of elastic processes are both present in photoproduction it is quite natural that perturbative qcd can help to understand many features of the hera experimental results .",
    "examples where perturbative qcd has been applied to this process can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in these perturbative calculations regarding diffractive processes , that in this case have characteristic features of the elastic ones , non perturbative contributions are present and",
    "their description becomes an important ingredient of the theoretical model while lying outside perturbation theory .",
    "hence , models based on regge pole phenomenology maintain their important task in helping to construct a representation of non perturbative aspects of the scattering amplitude .",
    "for the processes under consideration many papers based on regge poles exchange successfully reproduced  @xcite new experimental hera data . a different approach to asymptotic behavior",
    "was advocated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to expound the properties of the most important and intricate regge exchange : the vacuum , or pomeron exchange .",
    "@xmath10 photoproduction and , apart from small subleading contributions , @xmath11 photoproduction are genuine pomeron filters that , together with very high energies reactions , permit a careful study of the non perturbative features of diffraction .    after a short description of the model , that has been already introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in section 2 , an analysis of the hera data for @xmath10 and @xmath11 photoproduction and electroproduction will be presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "a test of the pomeron universality where the model is applied to proton - antiproton elastic scattering at very high energy will be considered in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions in section 6 will complete the paper .",
    "a convenient way to obtain rising cross sections with the pomeron intercept equal to one assumes that the pomeron is a double regge pole .",
    "this means that the @xmath12-channel partial wave , corresponding to the pomeron exchange , has a double pole for @xmath13 . in this choice",
    "we are comforted by the numerous successes of this model in its applications to hadronic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section will then increase logarithmically with @xmath14 at large energies .",
    "the reason why non asymptotic contributions are more important for the dipole than for the regge pole can be easily seen .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , is @xmath17 . in the case of a dipole , the corrections are of the order @xmath18 since a simple calculation gives , in the limit @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21.\\ ] ] to this correction , that could influence the low energy behavior of the amplitude , we must add the contribution of a pomeron daughter , that is difficult to estimate , and the possibility that also quarks be present in the pomeron .",
    "all these arguments suggest that it is better to apply the model as far as possible from the low energy region , choosing the invariant scattering amplitude in the form @xmath22\\ ; , \\label{d1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions , for the moment undetermined , of the momentum transfer .",
    "@xmath25 is the pomeron trajectory with @xmath26 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath24 , that represents the product of the vertices @xmath27-pomeron - meson and proton - pomeron - proton , will be made by imposing the condition that the pomeron exchange is pure spin @xmath28 exchange .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that this constraint leads to a vertex of the form @xmath29 $ ] and , in the neighborhood of @xmath30 , to a term vanishing with @xmath12 whatever the form of the trajectory could be .",
    "the presence of this term , that is usually neglected , makes the determination of the slope independent of the value of the differential cross section in the forward direction and can help in explaining non trivial properties of the forward cone .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the simple form for the elastic differential cross section of vector meson photoproduction @xmath31 ^ 2\\left ( \\frac{s}{s_0}\\right)^{2\\alpha_p(t)-2}\\left[\\left(\\ln\\frac{s}{s_0}+g\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right]\\ ; , \\label{d2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a constant , gives a good quality fit to the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the form ( [ d2 ] ) satisfies also the aforesaid conditions and will be adopted in this paper .",
    "since the amplitude , in the regge form , should have no essential singularity at infinity in the cut plane , @xmath33 is bounded by a constant , for @xmath34 , and this leads to the bound @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 an arbitrary constant .",
    "the choice  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , satisfies the above conditions and reproduces the standard pomeron slope at @xmath30 , @xmath41 .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) for the trajectory defines uniquely the model for photoproduction .",
    "consider now electroproduction of a vector meson .",
    "as noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite a commonly adopted form for the @xmath42 dependence of the @xmath43 cross section is @xmath44 where @xmath45 , according to the zeus collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath46 according to the h1 collaboration  @xcite .    for large @xmath42 all the amplitudes but the double flip one , for diffractive vector meson electroproduction , can be evaluated in perturbative qcd  @xcite . in the longitudinal photon amplitudes ,",
    "a factor @xmath47 is a consequence of gauge invariance irrespective of the detailed production dynamics . if we consider only the dominant twist @xmath14-channel helicity conserving amplitudes , the factor in eq .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) thus finds a natural explanation .",
    "the @xmath42 dependence , however , will appear also in the strong coupling and in the gluon structure function through the hard scale of perturbative qcd  @xcite .    in our approach , based on regge pole theory , the factor ( [ d4 ] )",
    "will be certainly present in electroproduction , multiplying the differential cross section ( [ d2 ] ) , but this will not complete all the possible corrections . since , in the dipole pomeron formalism , the product of the vertices can affect the parameter @xmath32 , all the parameters can acquire a weak @xmath42 dependence .",
    "we neglect this dependence in @xmath48 and assume that @xmath32 varies as @xmath49^{\\gamma}$ ] where @xmath27 , if this assumption is correct , is small",
    ". one can interpret this functional dependence of @xmath32 as coming from a @xmath42 dependence of @xmath50 in @xmath51 .",
    "0.3 cm the final form of the differential cross section is : @xmath52 ^ 2 \\left(\\frac{s}{s_0 } \\right)^{2\\alpha_p ( t)-2}\\times\\ ] ] @xmath53^{\\gamma}\\right]^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right)\\ ; , \\label{d5}\\ ] ] where , for @xmath54 , all the parameters have the same value as for photoproduction .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath55 includes a factor @xmath56 that comes from the contribution of the longitudinal amplitude , relevant at @xmath57 , which leads to @xmath58 .",
    "the approximate relation @xmath59 can be applied in this phenomenological approach .    in the following sections",
    "the parameterizations ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d5 ] ) will be applied to @xmath43 and @xmath11 photoproduction and electroproduction . only for these processes , in fact , the dominant exchange is due to the pomeron and we do not need to introduce non - leading trajectories .",
    "we can thus avoid contributions that can interfere with the object of our study and that , at intermediate energies where data are available , can be large .",
    "following the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite we apply eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) to the new dataset of @xmath43 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "this dataset represents measurements of @xmath43 photoproduction in two channels : @xmath60 and @xmath61 which may possibly have different normalizations especially for differential cross sections . to test if it is so we limit our fit to the region @xmath62 and check the predictions of the model for the differential cross section and the total integrated cross section .",
    "as noticed in the previous paper @xcite , the parameter @xmath63 varies little in the fit , so that we keep the same value @xmath64 fixed , thus leaving only four parameters free . in order to avoid the region of inelastic background",
    "we limit the @xmath12 region to @xmath65 . in the fit we use differential cross sections only . for the electron channel",
