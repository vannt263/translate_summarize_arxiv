    "the conventional picture for type  ia supernovae ( sn ia ) is that they are thermonuclear explosions of c - o white dwarf stars ( wd ) .",
    "two possible routes to explosion have been explored : single degenerate ( sd ) models in which the wd is nudged to explosion by accretion from a binary companion , and double degenerate ( dd ) models in which two wds merge .",
    "sn ia have been the essential tool in establishing the hubble constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showing a sub - critical matter density @xcite , and demonstrating that the cosmic expansion is accelerating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet the precise nature of sn ia progenitors remains uncertain .    in the sd scenario",
    ", there is only a narrow range of physical conditions for accretion to increase the wd mass over time .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the dd pathway may lead to neutron star formation @xcite , but recent studies suggest explosion as a sn ia is possible @xcite .",
    "both scenarios may contribute to the sn ia population so it is important to consider their observable differences .",
    "the presence or absence of carbon and its velocity distribution should be strong clues to the nature of the explosion .",
    "for example , multi - dimensional calculations of pure deflagrations predict that unburned material should be mixed into low - velocity layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fact that carbon is not commonly seen in deep layers suggests that most sn ia are not a result of pure deflagration .",
    "carbon is most often weak or absent in optical and infrared spectra of sn ia @xcite .",
    "this suggests that burning to intermediate mass elements takes place in the outer layers of a c - o wd for most sn ia .",
    "the model that matches this feature best is a delayed detonation in a sd system since dd merger and pulsating delayed detonation ( pdd ) explosions are likley to leave significant unburned material in the outer layers @xcite .",
    "conversely , the presence of carbon raises the possibility of a dd merger .",
    "dd mergers could also have masses and luminosities that extend beyond the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "two recent sn ia may have been merger events : the extremely luminous sn  2003fg was interpreted by @xcite as arising from a super - chandrasekhar ( s - ch ) progenitor , and a compressed silicon layer in sn  2005hj provides indirect evidence for an unburned layer atop the silicon @xcite .    here",
    "we present spectra and light curves of the type  ia supernova 2006gz that begin two weeks before maximum light .",
    "they directly show the strongest signature of unburned carbon ever reported and a low silicon velocity at very early times .",
    "the light curve is very broad and luminous , approaching the luminosity of sn  2003fg .",
    "these properties suggest that sn  2006gz may have arisen from the merger of two wds .",
    "sn  2006gz was discovered by @xcite and independently by @xcite on 2007 sept . 26.0 ( ut ) .",
    "it was classified as a type  ia event by @xcite who noted an unusual double absorption feature instead of the typical si ii 6355  line .",
    "the supernova was 12  west and 28  south of the center of the scd spiral galaxy ic  1277 , corresponding to a projected distance of 14.4 kpc .",
    "it should be noted that the 21-cm radio - based redshift of 0.0280 @xcite is incorrect .",
    "we report z=0.0237 @xmath40.0004 based on our optical spectrum of ic  1277 , in close agreement with other optical redshifts reported in ned .",
    "seven spectra were obtained with the 2.4-m mdm telescope and the ohio state university boller and chivens ccd spectrograph beginning 2006 sept .",
    "28.1 ( ut ) , 14 days before maximum light .",
    "a 2  slit and a 150 line / mm grating were used .",
    "the resolution was @xmath515 .",
    "a series of 10 spectra was taken with the fred l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.5-m tillinghast telescope and fast spectrograph @xcite , also starting sept .",
    "28.1 ( ut ) .",
    "a 3  slit and 300 line / mm grating were mounted .",
    "the resolution was @xmath57 .",
    "beginning sept .",
    "29.1 ( ut ) , 23 nights of @xmath6 photometry were aquired on the flwo 1.2 m telescope and keplercam instrument .",
    "eleven comparison stars were calibrated on 4 photometric nights in @xmath7 , 3 nights in @xmath8 , and 1 night in @xmath9 , with a typical @xmath10-band uncertainty of 0.014 mag per star .",
    "host galaxy subtraction images were taken in @xmath11 on 2007 may 27.4 ( ut ) and in @xmath9 on june 27.4 ( ut ) , after sn  2006gz had faded sufficiently .",
    "the flwo and mdm spectra taken at 14 days both show features typical of a type  ia supernova .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig_spec ] , intermediate - mass elements ( , and ) are clearly present .",
    "@xcite noted that the most unusual aspect of the early spectra is the extra absorption seen redward of the 6355  feature .",
    "absorption features at this wavelength have been identified with 6580  @xcite . using the synow code to generate synthetic spectra @xcite , and reproduce this feature and the absorption at 5490  better than a combination of and .",
    "we adopt this interpretation .",
    "lines at 4745  and 7234  may also be seen before -10 days . at two weeks before maximum light the feature has a rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of 25  in sn  2006gz , while in sn  1990n @xcite the feature is seen at 5  ew .",
    "@xcite reports a strong detection in sn  2006d with 7  ew at 7 days . in the case of sn  2006gz",
    ", the absorption strength is comparable to the ew of 37  at 14 days but quickly weakens and is undetectable past 10 days ( figure  [ fig_vel ] ) .",
    "the ew increases after the initial spectrum and reaches 70  near maximum brightness .    unlike the luminous and slowly declining sn 1991 t ,",
    "the spectra before maximum light are not dominated by fe iii lines .",
    "but the ratio of 5972 to the 6355  line seen here does correspond to the values seen in other very slowly declining sn ia ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "except for the 5972  feature , many of the lines in sn  2006gz are particularly deep and narrow , including 3858  and 4130 .",
    "there is also a strong line ( 4560 ) and may also be the source of the absorption observed at 5500  @xcite .",
    "we measure the velocity to be @xmath513100 @xmath12  at 14 and 13 days , in contrast to @xmath515500 @xmath12  in sn  1990n at 14 days ( figure  [ fig_vel ] ) .",
    "but the sn  2006gz velocity is similar to the silicon velocity in sn  1990n and sn  1994d before 11 days @xcite .",
    "the velocity does not show the rapid decline that was observed in other sn ia before 7 days . at 10 days",
    "it is at @xmath512500 @xmath12  and declines by only 1000 @xmath12  to 11500 @xmath12  by maximum light . in four cases of sn",
    "ia caught in early phases ( 1990n , 1994d , 2002bo , and 2003du ) the velocities at @xmath13 days were 2000 to 4000 @xmath12  higher than that at maximum light @xcite . in sn  2006gz ,",
    "the velocity of the is unusually low and constant at the earliest times , possibly as a result of overlying material for which the line is evidence .",
    "a tantalizing hint of an early plateau in velocity is suggested by the unchanging velocities in both and between days 14 and 13 .",
    "after 7 days , the velocity slowly declines , with a slope similar to sn  1990n and sn  1994d .    in the dd merger models ( and pdd models ) studied by @xcite , the detonation of the dense c - o occurs within a low - density c - o envelope .",
    "the unburned envelope compresses the outer , partially burned material , creating a density enhancement in the silicon layer which slows the photosphere from receding into lower - velocity layers . in sn  2005hj , @xcite inferred the presence of overlying material from the observed velocity plateau , but they did not have direct evidence for a carbon - rich layer . in sn 2006gz ,",
    "carbon is definitely present , but the possible velocity plateau is very brief and very early .",
    "sn  2006gz has one of the broadest light curves ( figure  [ fig_lc ] ) of any sn ia ever measured : its 15-day @xmath14-band decline from maximum light is @xmath0 , with @xmath15 jd .",
    "the rise time of 16.6 @xmath4 0.6 days is very short for the slow decline and does not fit the positive correlation between rise and decline time in light curve fitters such as mlcs2k2 @xcite and dm15 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find evidence for a bimodal sn ia rise time distribution based on a sample of 8 objects : @xmath16 days and @xmath17 days .",
    "the decline rate is also outside the range used to construct these fitters .",
    "the @xmath18-band peaks several days after @xmath14 and does not appear to have the pronounced trough or second peak expected for a very luminous sn ia . for comparison , sn  2001ay has @xmath19@xmath20 but its luminosity of @xmath21 is significantly lower than expected for its decline rate@xcite .",
    "slow - declining and overluminous sn ia are found almost exclusively in late - type galaxies while fast - declining and subluminous sn ia are usually found in early - type hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that there may be 2 populations of sn ia progenitors : a promptly - exploding component that dominates the supernova rate in star - forming galaxies , and a `` tardy '' one that gives rise to most of the sn ia in older hosts .",
    "how the sd and dd pathways may relate to the correlation between luminosity and host type , and to the prompt and tardy progenitor components , needs further investigation .",
    "the luminosity and extinction of sn  2006gz in @xmath22 are given in table  [ table_mag ] .",
    "we correct for galactic reddening using the dust maps of @xcite and apply @xmath23-corrections .",
    "we use a hubble - flow distance modulus of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and a peculiar velocity uncertainty of 300 @xmath12 ) to get absolute luminosities of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , before correction for host reddening .",
    "there are , however , 2 pieces of evidence for host reddening .",
    "first , the absorption at the sn position has an @xmath31 , giving rise to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath33 color shows normal , albeit slow , evolution .",
    "it increases by @xmath5 1.3 mag between maximum light and 35 days after .",
    "we apply @xmath23-corrections and correct for time dilation and galactic reddening in the @xmath33 color curve . from + 35 to + 51 days , sn 2006gz has a color evolution consistent with the lira relation @xcite , implying a host color excess of @xmath34 ( figure  [ fig_lc ] ) .",
    "we adopt this while cautioning that it may be incorrect if lira s relation does not apply . since the spectra are normal after 10 days , and the lira - corrected @xmath33 and @xmath35 colors at maximum are consistent with those reported in figure 9 of @xcite , it is not unreasonable to assume that lira s relation applies .",
    "the correct value of the reddening law for sn ia is under active study @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath36 and @xmath37 to give a wide range of plausible host extinctions and we calculate absolute magnitudes for sn  2006gz ( see table  [ table_mag ] ) . using @xmath36 gives @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "this is comparable to the possibly s - ch sn  2003fg , which had an absolute magnitude of @xmath41 ( @xmath26 ) and a color of @xmath42 , implying its host reddening was quite small .",
    "the case of @xmath43 gives @xmath44 for sn  2006gz .",
    "we also calculated a uvoir light curve of sn  2006gz with @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "we follow the procedure of @xcite to derive a @xmath3ni mass ( @xmath47 ) of @xmath48 . for @xmath37 , @xmath49 .",
    "the detonation of a @xmath50 wd can produce @xmath51 of @xmath3ni ( khokhlov , a. 2007 , private communication ) . in figure  [ fig_ni ] , we plot @xmath47 against @xmath19for the 16 sn ia in @xcite and add sn  2006gz , sn  2003fg , and sn  2001ay @xcite",
    ".    the dd merger models of @xcite consist of a 1.2 @xmath52 wd detonation inside c - o envelopes of different masses .",
    "they produce @xmath53 of @xmath3ni .",
    "the envelope decelerates the layers of the exploded wd , increases their density , and thus raises the diffusion time .",
    "this produces broader light curves , as seen in sn  2006gz after maximum .",
    "merger models with larger , s - ch primary wds should be explored to see if they can explain the properties of sn  2006gz . a different cause of the fast rise time and high luminosity could be an off - centered explosion , with the nickel - rich region towards us @xcite .",
    "the three outstanding features of sn  2006gz are the presence of carbon , the low early - time silicon velocity , and the luminous , broad light curve .",
    "sn  2006gz shows the strongest evidence for unburned carbon of any sn ia observed to date .",
    "the strong carbon feature has a higher expansion velocity than the silicon and fades quickly .",
    "the carbon is part of the photosphere at early times .",
    "the obvious inference is that the explosion did not burn all the carbon .",
    "this could be explained by the outer wd c - o layer being accelerated and diluted during a deflagration phase . it is also possible that the envelope of the dd merger could be shocked and accelerated within the first few seconds of explosion and give rise to the observed carbon .",
    "the light curve is one of the broadest sn ia ever seen with @xmath0 . if it obeys the lira relation then it produced @xmath54  ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath55  ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "combined with this , the presence of copious silicon and other non - iron - peak elements rules out a sd detonation and makes a s - ch progenitor a good possibility . in both sd and dd cases ,",
    "the centrifugal force of rotation can allow wds to grow beyond @xmath56 .",
    "however , the dd scenario is simpler in the sense that no helium or hydrogen shell burning is required to build up the primary wd .    taken separately , the three main features of sn  2006gz can be explained by various models .",
    "first , the unburned carbon is plausible to different degrees in the sd and dd scenarios .",
    "second , the suppressed silicon velocity is predicted by dd models .",
    "third , the luminous and broad light curve with high implied @xmath3ni mass is possible in sd and dd models .",
    "however , taking all of these features together points to a consistent picture in which sn  2006gz is the result of the merger of two white dwarfs .",
