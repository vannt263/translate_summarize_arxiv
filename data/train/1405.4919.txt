    "the dimension theory of self - affine sets has attracted a great deal of attention in the literature over the past 30 years .",
    "there are two key starting points which have led to two thriving and complementary strands of research .",
    "the ` generic case ' studies general self - affine sets by randomising the translation vectors in the defining iterated function system in an appropriate way and then making _ almost sure _ statements about the corresponding attractors .",
    "this approach began with falconer s seminal paper @xcite in 1988 , which introduced the _ affinity dimension _ as a sure upper bound for the upper box dimension of any self - affine set and if the translation vectors are randomised and the norms of the defining matrices are strictly smaller than 1/2 , then the hausdorff , box and packing dimensions of the attractor are all almost surely equal to the affinity dimension",
    ". some articles following this approach are @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ` specific approach ' focuses on special classes of self - affine sets designed in a way to facilitate calculations and allows _ sure _ statements to be made about the attractors .",
    "this began with the work of bedford @xcite and mcmullen @xcite from 1985 which introduced self - affine carpets and computed their hausdorff and box dimensions .",
    "of particular note is that these values are typically different and strictly less than the affinity dimension .",
    "this second approach was further developed in @xcite among others .",
    "this paper has two main purposes .",
    "on one hand , we blend the two approaches in a natural context .",
    "we begin with a bedford - mcmullen carpet and then randomise the translations whilst maintaining the key structural feature : the column alignment .",
    "this will be elaborated on in the following section . on the other hand , we wanted to illustrate how a recent breakthrough of hochman @xcite on the dimensions of self - similar sets and measures can also be applied to obtain analogous results for self - affine sets .",
    "we obtain formulae for the hausdorff , box and packing dimensions valid outside of a small set of parameters , with two points of interest being that the values of the dimension are typically _ different _ from each other and from the affinity dimension , and our class contains many _ overlapping _ self - affine sets .",
    "fix positive integers @xmath2 and divide the unit square into a uniform @xmath3 grid .",
    "the grid rectangles can now be labelled in a natural way as @xmath4 .",
    "choose a non - empty subset @xmath5 and for each @xmath6 , let @xmath7 denote the affine contraction which maps the unit square onto the rectangle indexed by @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 together , the maps @xmath10 form an iterated function system ( ifs ) and it is well - known that there exists a unique non - empty compact set @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 this set @xmath11 is called the attractor of the ifs and this class of attractors was first studied in the mid - eighties independently by bedford @xcite and mcmullen @xcite , who each gave a formula for the hausdorff and box dimensions .",
    "such sets are now known as bedford - mcmullen carpets .",
    "we wish to consider the following generalisation . for a given bedford - mcmullen system ,",
    "we randomise the horizontal translates , whilst keeping the column structure intact , i.e. , we always assume that if two rectangles are in the same column initially , then they are translated horizontally by the same amount",
    ". see figures [ fig : pattern ] and [ fig : carpets ] .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that because we keep some alignment in the construction , even though we randomise the system , the ` typical ' dimensions are still exceptional ( we will see that in fact they are the same as the dimensions of the original system ) .",
    "thus we provide a smoothly parametrised family of potentially overlapping self - affine carpets whose dimensions are strictly less than the affinity dimension .     and @xmath13.,width=377 ]",
    "more formally , let @xmath14 be the projection of @xmath15 onto the first co - ordinate . to each @xmath16",
    "we associate a ` random translation ' @xmath17 $ ] and for a given set of translates @xmath18^{{\\overline}{d}}$ ] we define a new ifs consisting of the maps @xmath19 and denote the attractor , which of course depends on @xmath20 , by @xmath21 . in the case",

    "we underline that the dimensions appearing in theorems [ mainh ] and [ mainb ] are the same as the dimensions of the original carpet as proved by bedford and mcmullen .",
    "we recall that ( for the unperturbed carpets ) the box counting dimension is obtained by covering each rectangle in the @xmath43-th stage of the construction by the same number of disks of the appropriate size , independently of each other . when allowing covers by disks of different sizes , it is usually more efficient to cover large collections of parallel rectangles by a single disk , leading to the expression for hausdorff dimension ( which also has a variational interpretation as the supremum of hausdorff dimensions of bernoulli measures for the natural markov partition of the carpet ) .",
    "our results suggest that this geometric picture typically persists when the columns are allowed to overlap .",
    "we finish this section by commenting on the relation between these results and previous work on the subject .",

    "is that these typical dimensions are strictly less than the affinity dimension .",

    "we consider only the special case of _ homogeneous _ self - similar measures , which is all we will require . to this end , consider an affine ifs of the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a finite index set and @xmath68 is a fixed contraction rate and the maps @xmath30 are assumed to act on @xmath69 .",

    "since @xmath248 , we have @xmath249 let @xmath250 .",

    "we note that the fact we used reciprocals of integers @xmath295 and @xmath296 as the principle contractions in the defining system was not important .",
    "we could equally well have chosen arbitrary @xmath297 $ ] with @xmath298 . moreover",
    ", we could allow different arrangements of the @xmath299 rectangles in each fixed column provided they do not overlap , i.e. they need not be integer multiples of @xmath300 apart .",
    "see figure [ fig : generalpattern ] for an example of a pattern of this more general type .",
    "thus , we have the following result .        [ generalisation ]",
    "let @xmath301 .",
    "suppose there are numbers @xmath302 for some integers",
    "@xmath303 such that @xmath304 and @xmath305 for all @xmath306 .",
    "given @xmath307 , let @xmath21 be the attractor of the ifs @xmath308 , where @xmath309 then for all @xmath310^m$ ] such that the ifs @xmath311 does not have super exponential concentration of cylinders , we have @xmath312 in particular , this holds for all @xmath20 outside of an exceptional set @xmath42 ( depending only on @xmath91 ) of hausdorff and packing dimension @xmath313 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath91 is algebraic , then it also holds for all algebraic @xmath20 such that the ifs @xmath311 does not have an exact overlap .",
    "we make some remarks on the assumptions of the above theorem .",
    "the restrictions @xmath314 $ ] and @xmath310 $ ] are not essential ; they simply make sure that @xmath315 is a subset of the unit square , which can always be achieved by a change of coordinates .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath305 guarantees that the rectangles in each column are non - overlapping , and this is an obvious necessary condition in general .",
    "the assumption @xmath316 is meant to ensure that the similarity dimension of the projected self - similar set ( and measure ) is at most @xmath317 , and we require @xmath318 so that @xmath316 is not a vacuous assumption . for the box dimension calculation , these are not essential restrictions : if @xmath319 and @xmath320 is arbitrary , the proof goes through just by replacing @xmath321 by @xmath317 at the points where the dimension of the projection comes up ( in the proofs of both the lower and upper bound ) , to give the same result with the formula for the box dimension replaced by @xmath322 for hausdorff dimension , however , the result fails if @xmath323 .",
    "recall that a _ pisot number _ is an algebraic integer @xmath324 such that all its algebraic conjugates are @xmath325 in modulus .",
    "it is well known that pisot numbers accumulate to @xmath326 .",
    "take @xmath182 , @xmath327 to be any pisot number in @xmath328 , any @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "note that the translations do not play a role when @xmath182 ( as long as the maps do not have the same fixed point , which is a co - dimension one phenomenon in parameter space ) . in this case",
    "it was shown by przytycki and urbaski in @xcite that the hausdorff dimension drops from the `` expected '' value , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 15 ) for a simpler proof using mcmullen s method from @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latter proof shows that the same phenomenon holds if @xmath331 is pisot , for any @xmath332 and any @xmath333 .",
    "we note that the issue here is that @xmath323 ; it would be interesting to understand the behaviour of hausdorff dimension when @xmath334 but @xmath335 .",
    "there are various other directions in which this work could move .",
    "a further generalisation in the direction of theorem [ generalisation ] would be to consider lalley - gatzouras type columns @xcite , which would allow for rectangles of varying heights and widths .",
    "we do not see any difficulty in extending our arguments to cover this setting , but do not pursue it here to aid clarity of exposition .",
    "one could also consider random versions of the more general self - affine carpets considered by baraski @xcite , feng - wang @xcite or fraser @xcite , however , in these cases our random model seems less natural as the dimension can depend on both principal projections , rather than just @xmath138 .    in this article",
    "we have focused on the case with `` column alignment '' where the dimension drops from the affinity dimension , but theorems [ mainh ] , [ mainb ] and [ generalisation ] hold also when each column has just one rectangle , i.e. there are no special alignments , and in this case the dimension formulas we obtain coincide with the affinity dimension of the respective systems .",
    "once one gives up the alignment , it makes sense to consider arbitrary self - affine systems , including those for which there is no dominant direction for all maps .",
    "we hope to address this situation in a forthcoming paper , leading to an improvement on falconer s classical theorem from @xcite in the case of diagonal maps .",
    "another interesting direction for further work would be to consider self - affine measures supported on our carpets",
    ". then one could ask if , for example , the hausdorff dimension or @xmath336-spectrum was almost surely equal to the hausdorff dimension or @xmath336-spectrum when the columns do not overlap . for the hausdorff dimension of self - affine measures , the proof of theorem [ mainh ] should apply with minor changes to yield an analogous result .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath336-spectra behave more like box counting dimension , and our methods clearly do not work here as we heavily relied on taking subsystems , which does not work for measures , but only for sets .",
    "one could also look at different notions of dimension other than just the hausdorff , packing and box dimensions considered here .",
    "for example , the assouad dimension @xmath337 , and its natural dual the lower dimension @xmath338 , have recently been gaining some attention in the literature on fractals and in particular overlapping self - similar sets @xcite and self - affine carpets @xcite .",
    "the definitions of these dimensions are quite technical and so we do not give them here , but rather refer the reader to the papers @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties of our construction is that the box and hausdorff dimensions can never be larger than the box and hausdorff dimensions of the original bedford - mcmullen carpet .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly pointing out via two simple examples that this is not the case for assouad and lower dimension .",
    "this is based on the recent work of mackay @xcite and fraser @xcite who computed these dimensions for certain classes of self - affine carpets .",
    "[ frasermackay ] let @xmath11 be a standard bedford - mcmullen carpet .",
    "then @xmath339 and @xmath340    we will now use this theorem to provide examples showing that the assouad and lower dimension can increase from the original values upon translation of columns .",
    "the iterated function systems and their attractors will be given in the following figures .",
    "in all cases we choose @xmath341 and @xmath25 .",
    "( left ) and @xmath342 ( right ) . note that we can translate the columns in the carpet on the left to obtain the carpet on the right.,width=302 ]    by theorem [ frasermackay ] , we have @xmath343     ( left ) and @xmath344 ( right ) . note that we can translate the columns in the carpet on the left to obtain the carpet on the right.,width=302 ]    by theorem [ frasermackay ] , we have @xmath345 throughout this paper we relied on being able to understand the dimension of the projection onto the first coordinate , which is a self - similar subset of the unit interval , typically with overlaps . the assouad dimension and lower dimension",
    "also depend on this , however , the assouad dimension of a self - similar subset of the unit interval with overlaps does not necessarily equal the hausdorff dimension . in @xcite",
    ", it was recently shown that in the cases when the assouad dimension is strictly greater than the hausdorff dimension , then it is automatically equal to 1 , no matter how small the hausdorff dimension is .",
    "the lower dimension , on the other hand , always coincides with the hausdorff dimension , see ( * ? ? ?",
