    "in a departure from classical voting theory , a growing literature from computational social choice has recently studied _ multi - winner _ voting rules : given diverse preferences of a collection of agents , instead of identifying a single best alternative , we are aiming for a ( fixed - size ) _ set _ of alternatives that jointly are able to represent the preferences of the agents best .",
    "such procedures are useful in a wide variety of circumstances : obvious examples include the election of a parliament , or of a committee representing the interests of members of an organisation .",
    "other applications can be found in group recommendation systems , or for making decisions about which products or services to offer : which courses should be offered at a university ? which movies should be presented on an airline entertainment system ?    several attractive rules for such tasks have been designed by researchers in political science ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) and more recently by computer scientists @xcite .",
    "many of these rules are defined in terms of some objective function : a winning committee is a set of @xmath0 candidates that maximises this objective .",
    "unsurprisingly , then , the winner determination problems of such rules are typically np - hard @xcite . to tackle the complexity of these problems , approximation algorithms @xcite and fixed - parameter tractability approaches @xcite have been developed for these problems , and integer programming formulations",
    "have also been designed for them @xcite .",
    "another approach to efficiently solving these winner determination problems seeks to exploit underlying structure in the preferences reported by the agents @xcite .",
    "a particularly popular _ preference restriction _ in this space is the notion of _ single - peaked preferences _ , due to @xcite and @xcite . under this model ,",
    "the alternative space has a one - dimensional structure : alternatives are ordered on a left - to - right _ axis _ ; and agents preferences are monotonically decreasing as we move further away from their _ peak _ ( most - preferred alternative ) . in particular , we can expect preferences to be structured this way when voting over the value of a numerical quantity ( such as a tax rate ) . while single - peaked preferences were first employed to escape impossibility results in social choice theory @xcite",
    ", it also yields positive algorithmic results : notably , @xcite showed that chamberlin ",
    "courant s committee selection rule can be computed efficiently when preferences are single - peaked .",
    "these results can be extended to other multi - winner voting rules @xcite , and to other preference restriction such as single - crossing preferences , or single - peakedness on trees @xcite .",
    "the algorithms mentioned all directly exploit the underlying structure of the preferences .",
    "for example , the algorithm due to betzler et al .",
    "proceeds by dynamic programming along the single - peaked axis .",
    "thus , to use this algorithm , we first need a procedure to uncover this axis .",
    "fortunately , efficient recognition algorithms for the mentioned domains are known ; in particular , a suitable axis can be found in linear time @xcite .",
    "thus , the approach to tractability via preference restrictions would look roughly like shown in : given input preferences , apply recognition algorithms for several preference restrictions , and if any of these tests succeed , use a special - purpose algorithm that performs well when preferences have the uncovered structure . if none of the tests succeed , fall back to some ( superpolynomial ) general - purpose solver , such as an integer programming solver .",
    "but there is something awkward about linking together this cacophony of algorithms : given the amazing progress in solver technology in recent decades ( such as witnessed in sat competitions or in commercial ip solvers ) , it might well be faster in practice to skip these intermediate steps and go straight to cplex .",
    "( this objection becomes stronger once implementation effort is factored in . )",
    "further , modern ip solvers are often able to exploit underlying structure automatically : experimentally , solving times on single - peaked instances are much faster than on random instances .",
    "while such an experimental result is nice , performance guarantees are better .",
    "could it be that , on certain single - peaked instances , an ip solver performs exponentially worse than special - purpose algorithms ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "this paper shows that integer programming solvers will _ provably _ terminate in polynomial time when solving certain voting problems on single - peaked inputs . in more detail , for several voting rules ( including chamberlin  courant and proportional approval voting ) , we will design ip formulations which are solved optimally by their lp relaxation when the preference input happens to be single - peaked . since all standard ip solvers first solve the lp relaxation , they will terminate with the correct answer in their first iteration .",
    "if the instance is not single - peaked , the ip solver might enter further iterations while solving ",
    "importantly , our formulations are correct whether or not the input is single - peaked .",
    "moreover , this approach to achieving polynomial time efficiency does not require separately running a recognition algorithm !",
    "the ip solver need not know an underlying axis , or even whether the input is single - peaked at all ; the lp relaxation will just ` magically ' have an integral solution .",
    "our proofs rely on establishing that the constraint matrices become totally unimodular in the single - peaked case .",
    "previous applications of this technique include certain tractable cases of the winner determination problems of combinatorial auctions ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our method also allows us to show that a conjecture due to @xcite is false .",
    "they consider structure in _ dichotomous preferences _ based on approval ballots , where agents only submit a binary yes / no decision for every candidate .",
    "in particular , they consider an analogue of single - peakedness in this setting ( which they call _ candidate interval _ or _ ci _ ) , which requires there to be an ordering ( axis ) of the candidates such that , for every voter , their set of approved candidates forms an interval of the axis .",
    "they then analyse an axiomatically particularly attractive multi - winner rule for the approval setting , known as proportional approval voting ( pav ) . while @xcite showed that pav is efficiently computable for a certain subclass of their ci concept , and obtained fpt results for ci preferences , they conjectured that pav remains np - hard for ci preferences in general .",
    "this conjecture appears to be largely based on the difficulty of solving this problem using dynamic programming approaches that typically work in single - peaked settings .",
    "our method , on the other hand , allows us to find a polynomial - time algorithm for this case , via ip solving .",
    "we then combine the approaches for chamberlin  courant and pav to give a similar polynomial time result for so - called owa - based multi - winner rules in the case that preferences are single - peaked .",
    "we further give an ip formulation that computes young s voting rule efficiently for single-_crossing _ preferences , and close by briefly sketching applications of our method to some further rules and settings .",

    "it follows that appending a unit column @xmath16 will not destroy total unimodularity .",

    "it follows that young scores can be computed in polynomial time when preferences are single - crossing .",
    "this in itself is not an impressive result , since there is a very easy direct algorithm for solving this special case , on top the median yields the young score of @xmath49 .",

    "* more than single - peakedness . *",
    "our polynomial - time results apply to a slightly larger class than just single - peaked profiles : they also apply when @xmath133 ( with an all-1s row appended ) is totally unimodular but does not necessarily have the consecutive ones property .",
    "it can be shown that this is the case whenever @xmath43 contains only two distinct voters , or , more generally , when the set of all top - initial segments of @xmath43 can also be induced by a two - voter profile .",

    ", our ip formulations can easily be adapted to answer the question `` is there a committee with egalitarian objective value @xmath135 ? '' while preserving total unimodularity in the case of single - peaked preferences .",
    "an optimum committee can then be found by a binary search on @xmath136 .",
    "however , it is unclear how this can be achieved for owa - based rules .",
    "it is also unclear how to handle other utility aggregation operators such as leximin ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "* pav and voter intervals . * @xcite define an analogue of single - crossingness for dichotomous preferences called _ voter interval _",
    "( vi ) , which requires the _ transpose _ of @xmath133 to have the consecutive ones property . as for ci , they conjectured that pav remains hard on vi preferences .",
    "we could not solve this problem using our method : the constraint @xmath137 of ( pav - ip ) destroys total unimodularity .",

    "sadly , while ` most ' of the constraint matrix is again identical to @xmath133 , some extra constraints ( saying that the swaps in each vote should only count once ) destroy total unimodularity , so our method can not be employed for this formulation . note",
    "that while @xcite give an efficient algorithm for finding a dodgson _ winner _ in the case of single - peaked preferences , the problem of efficiently calculating _ scores _ appears to be open and non - trivial .",

    ", most strategies for calculating kemeny s rule first calculate all pairwise majority margins ; we might as well check for transitivity at this stage  trying to use fancy total unimodularity is unnecessary .",
