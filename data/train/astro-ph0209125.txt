    "tidal evolution leading to capture into resonance has been invoked to explain the many commensurabilites in our solar system ( e.g. goldreich 1965 ) , but the problem of breaking resonance due to tidal effects is less well - studied .",
    "the presence of even a small amount of dissipation can alter the dynamical evolution of the system . in this case",
    ", the dissipation causes the resonance to accelerate the circularization of the inner planet compared to what would happen in isolation .    the resonant interaction between the planets in the 55 cancri system",
    "imply that fully self - consistent fits are necessary to obtain the orbital elements of the system .",
    "the 3:1 resonance covers a narrow range of semi - major axes , so determining the location of the system within the resonance will require accurate fits , which requires additional data .",
    "direct integrations of the orbital elements given by one fully self - consistent fit ( laughlin 2002 ) indicate that the resonant angles are circulating and the system in _ not _ in resonance .    to study the long term dynamics of the system , we use the classical disturbing function together with lagrange s planetary equations to lowest order in eccentricity ( e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "we numerically integrate these equations using a variable time step bulirsch - stoer integrator .",
    "we consider tidal evolution in the regime where energy is dissipated and angular momentum is conserved .",
    "the eccentricity damping rate is given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , @xmath4 is the mass of the star , @xmath5 is the mass of the inner planet , @xmath6 parameterized tidal energy dissipation , @xmath7 is the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath8 is the planet s mean motion , and @xmath9 is the maximum amount of energy stored in the tidal deformation of the planet .",
    "the planet s eccentricity e - folding time in isolation is given by @xmath10 .",
    "in order to develop an understanding of the problem , we study a simplified case : the circular restricted three body problem where the inner planet is massless and the outer planet is @xmath11 .",
    "the resonant libration timescale is @xmath12 orbits of the outer planet , the secular evolution time is @xmath13 orbits .",
    "we assume that tidal dissipation occurs only in the inner planet .",
    "the tidal evolution timescale is typically _ much _ longer than the dynamical and secular timescales , so we choose a small value for q. this does not change the character of the dynamics as long as the tidal timescale remains long compared to other timescales .    as tides remove energy the outer planet supplies the inner planet with enough energy to maintain the commensurability , but an adiabatic invariant demands that the resonant angle s libration amplitude increase as the eccentricity decreases , eventually breaking the resonance .",
    "the energy flow is arranged by forcing the resonant angle librate to about a mean value slightly displaced from its equilibrium value of @xmath14 .",
    "the flow of angular momentum between the planets is determined by the same resonant angle and this results in _ faster _ circularization of the inner planet s orbit compared to the situation where the inner planet is isolated . in the case of the 3:1 resonance , the inner planet circularizes five times faster in the presence of an outer companion .",
    "the resonant angle s libration amplitude can be written as    @xmath15    where the subscripts @xmath16 refer to the inner and outer planets , @xmath5 is the mass of a planet , @xmath4 is the mass of the star , @xmath17 is the order of the resonance , @xmath18 is the resonant angle , @xmath19 is a constant determined by the resonance under consideration , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 refer to the full width of the libration .",
    "as energy is removed , the only one of these factors to change is the inner planets eccentricity which determines that the resonant angle will begin to circulate when : @xmath22 where the subscript @xmath23 refers to the values when tidal dissipation became important .",
    "once the resonance is broken the inner planet evolves to a circular orbit only under the influence of tides , where the final semi - major axis is @xmath24 and @xmath25 is that corresponding to the exact commensurability .",
    "the final period ratio of the two planets gives a constraint on how deep the two planets were in resonance when tidal effects became important .",
    "knowing the eccentricity decay timescale as augmented by the dynamics of the resonance allows us to write the time required to break the resonance after tidal effects become important as : @xmath26",
    "we used the classical disturbing function together with lagrange s planetary equations accurate to lowest order in eccentricity to study resonance breaking through tidal dissipation .",
    "it is possible to derive analytic expressions for the inner planet s eccentricity when the resonance is broken and the time required to break the resonance ( equations [ ebreakeqn ] , [ tbreakeqn ] ) .",
    "these expressions are in good agreement with the secular theory ( figure [ tbreak ] )    this is applicable to the 55 cancri system because the inner planet is near the regime where tidal effects are starting to play a role and current fits to the radial velocity curve give orbital elements where the planets are _ not _ in the resonance .",
    "we argue that the two planets became trapped in resonance while farther from the star and then broke the resonance when tidal dissipation began to play a role in the inner planet s evolution .",
