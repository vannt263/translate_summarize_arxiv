    "@xcite conjectured that for the critical circle map the mode locked intervals form a complete devil s staircase whose complementary set is a cantor set with a fractal dimension @xmath2 .",
    "further , their numerical results indicated that this dimension is universal for maps with a cubic inflection point .",
    "their results were obtained in a purely empirical fashion by computing the width of smaller and smaller mode locked steps and subtracting the summed widths from the total staircase length .",
    "the set in question is the set of irrational windings , which do not lead to mode locking .",
    "it is multifractal in nature and , more precisely , is believed to have a universal hausdorff dimension @xmath3 , in order to better characterize such sets , different thermodynamic formalisms @xcite have been introduced and with them , the idea of generalized dimensions @xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out that for the circle map , such a description is not unique and depends upon the details of how the rational numbers are partitioned .",
    "although we find the thermodynamics of the set for two distinct partitions is quite different , the hausdorff dimension _",
    "_ i__s the same in both cases .",
    "in order to illustrate this ambiquity , we shall examine a simple model for the widths of the mode locked intervals of the circle map and show that two different partitions of the rationals lead to two different functional forms for the free energy @xmath4 ( defined below ) and hence to different @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the width @xmath5 of the mode locked interval for the critical circle map associated with the winding number @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath7 independent of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are coprime integers ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants ( we assume @xmath12 ) .    in this model we know the widths of the mode locked intervals , however we do not know precisely where the left and right hand ends of the interval are located on [ 0,1 ] .",
    "this means we do not know exactly where the holes are located .",
    "however , when experiments are performed on one - dimensional quasiperiodic systems at the borderline of chaos @xcite , it is only possible to determine the ` devil s staircase ' for mode locked intervals at rational winding numbers @xmath6 where @xmath9 is relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to determine the thermodynamics of the system including an estimate of the hausdorff dimension of the set of irrational windings .    in this paper",
    ", we use a simple model for these widths and are able to construct the thermodynamics of this model .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the hausdorff dimension in agreement with that obtained by more general considerations .",
    "from eq ( [ widths ] ) we may analytically calculate the total sum of the widths of the mode locked intervals ( which is taken to be one at criticality ) .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath15 is the euler function @xcite .",
    "the sum in eq ( [ totalsum ] ) is over all irreducible rationals @xmath6 , @xmath16 , and @xmath5 is the width of the parameter interval for which the iterates of a critical circle map lock onto a cycle of length @xmath9 , with winding number @xmath6 .",
    "therefore @xmath10 is fixed to be @xmath17 now the hausdorff dimension is the largest value of @xmath18 for which the sum @xmath19}^{\\beta}}\\\\            & = k^{\\beta } { \\displaystyle \\sum_{q }   \\phi(q ) q^{-\\delta \\beta } }   \\\\            & = k^{\\beta } { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\zeta(\\delta \\beta -1)}{\\zeta(\\delta \\beta ) } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] diverges .",
    "it is clear from eq ( [ partition ] ) that there is a pole singularity in the sum when @xmath20 from above , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "we conclude therefore that the hausdorff dimension is given by @xmath22",
    "a method for extracting a spectrum of scalings from experimentally or numerically generated strange ( fractal ) sets was introduced by halsey et al .  @xcite using a  thermodynamic formalism \" .",
    "they found that the scaling properties of normalized distributions lying upon such sets were characterized by two indices , namely @xmath23 which determines the strength of the singularities and @xmath24 which describes how densely they are distributed .",
    "the spectrum of singularities is described by giving the range of @xmath23-values and the function @xmath25 .",
    "shortly thereafter feigenbaum @xcite pointed out that the work of halsey et al .",
    "was in fact the microcanonical version of a thermodynamical formalism introduced by vul , sinai and khanin @xcite in 1984 some years earlier .",
    "see also ruelle @xcite .",
    "he elucidated the canonical version ( canonical paradigm = cp ) in contrast to the microcanonical version ( microcanonical paradigm = mp ) .",
    "in this formulation , the probability measure is assumed constant on the set .",
    "this formalism introduces a free energy @xmath4 which is related to the @xmath26 as indicated below . in the following we use the notation of feigenbaum @xcite .",
    "consider a dynamical system whose attractor can be hierarchically represented as a set of @xmath27 intervals @xmath28 , @xmath29 of lengths @xmath30 at the @xmath31-th level .",

    "@xcite ) and the cp quantities ( feigenbaum @xcite ) is given by    @xmath34 \\label{conversion5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in order to proceed further , we first recall that for a given @xmath9 , the number of irreducible rationals @xmath6 is @xmath15 .",
    "the farey series of order @xmath9 , @xmath35 , is a set containing the monotonically increasing sequence of all irreducible rationals @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 are coprime ) between 0 and 1 whose denominator does not exceed @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "next we define a sequence of integers @xmath39 such that asymptotically @xmath40 with these @xmath41 , we define a sequence of farey series @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 etc .",
    "it follows that the number of rationals contained in @xmath45 _ but not in _ @xmath46 , is asymptotically twice the number contained in @xmath46 but not in @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore have a simple prescription for grouping the rationals into distinct exclusive sets @xmath47 - @xmath48 whose membership increases exponentially fast .",
    "we may re - express this statement by saying that the ratio of the number of rationals contained in each of these consecutive sets is given by @xmath49 asymptotically .",
    "we have used @xcite @xmath50 in the large @xmath9 limit .",
    "this construction defines a partition of the rationals from which one may define the free energy @xmath4 in this simple model asymptotically through @xmath51}_{q_{n+1}}^{q_{n+2 } }   }   }       { { \\displaystyle { [ q^{2- \\delta \\beta } ] } _ { q_{n}}^{q_{n+1 } }   }   } \\\\ & = & \\frac { { \\displaystyle q_{n+2}^{2- \\delta \\beta } - q_{n+1}^{2- \\delta \\beta } } } { { \\displaystyle q_{n+1}^{2- \\delta \\beta } - q_{n}^{2- \\delta \\beta } } } \\\\   & = & ( \\sqrt{2})^{2- \\delta \\beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we conclude that @xmath52 the free energy has the same form as that for a single scale cantor set , which is not surprising since there only appears to be a single length scale associated with this model .",
    "the hausdorff dimension is found from the condition @xmath53 i.e. @xmath54 in agreement with the result of eq ( [ conversion4 ] ) . using the @xmath26 language @xmath55",
    "i.e. the @xmath26 curve collapses to a single point .",
    "it should be noted that the expression for @xmath4 quoted in eq ( [ fefromseries ] ) _ in no way depends on the partition defined through _ eq ( [ qnlimit ] ) .",
    "indeed we could choose _ any _ @xmath56 such that @xmath57 which would lead instead to @xmath58 and again we have @xmath59    a natural choice for the @xmath41 that suggests itself is the fibonacci sequence , @xmath60 in which case @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the golden mean @xmath63 and @xmath64 in fact such a choice has been used @xcite for evaluating the free energy ( or its equivalent ) and the hausdorff dimension in the case of the real mode locking critical circle map .",
    "this is a different partition of the rationals which also utilized farey series .",
    "the crucial point , however , in both examples is that one may generate partitions of the rationals whose membership increases exponentially fast from one partition to the next ; by construction the variation in size of the denominator @xmath9 in the set @xmath65 is _ only of order _ 1 .",

    "one would expect that other partitions different from those discussed here would yield thermodynamic functions that are different from the ones depicted in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "an alternative way of stating the conclusion is that the farey series scheme for partitioning the rationals when one adopts this simplified model for the mode locking widths yields a _ single constant generalized dimension _",
    "@xmath106 , while the farey level tree partition clearly yields a result for @xmath0 which is not constant with variable @xmath91 .",
