    "regular polytopes in 4-dimensions are notoriously difficult to understand geometrically .",
    "coxeter s classic text @xcite is an excellent resource , concentrating on both the metric properties and the symmetry groups of regular polytopes .",
    "another approach to understanding these polytopes is through combinatorics ; we use matroids to model the linear dependence of a collection of vectors associated to the polytope .",
    "that is the context for this paper , and we concentrate on the matroid associated with the 120-cell or the 600-cell , two dual 4-dimensional regular polytopes .",
    "the connection between polytopes and matroids , or , more generally , between root systems and matroids , is as follows . given a finite set @xmath2 of vectors in @xmath3 possessing a high degree of symmetry , define the ( linear ) matroid @xmath4 as the dependence matroid for the set @xmath2 over @xmath5 .",
    "then there should be a close relationship between the symmetry group of the original set @xmath2 ( _ geometric _ symmetry ) and the matroid automorphism group @xmath6 ( _ combinatorial _ symmetry ) .",
    "in particular , every geometric symmetry necessarily preserves the dependence structure of @xmath2 , so gives rise to a matroid automorphism .",
    "the root system @xmath1 can be obtained by choosing the 120 vectors in @xmath7 that form the vertices of the 600-cell .",
    "these vectors come in 60 pairs , and each pair corresponds to a single point in the matroid .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a rank-4 matroid on 60 points .",
    "this paper generalizes and extends @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in understanding the structure of the matroid automorphism group @xmath8 .",
    "we show ( theorem  [ t : aut ] ) that @xmath8 contains _ non - geometric _ automorphisms in the sense that half of the 14,400 elements of @xmath8 do not arise from the coxeter / weyl group @xmath9 .",
    "we also prove the automorphism group of @xmath0 acts transitively on each class of flats of the matroid ( lemma  [ l : trans ] ) , and that the action is primitive ( theorem  [ t : prim ] ) .",
    "a key tool for understanding the structure of the automorphisms is the incidence relation among the flats of @xmath0 ( lemma  [ l : flatinc ] and proposition  [ p : planeintersect ] ) .",
    "this incidence structure allows us to compute the stabilizer of a point of the matroid ( lemma  [ l : stab ] ) , a fact we need to understand the structure of the group .",
    ".,width=384 ]    the connection between the geometric and combinatorial symmetry of certain root systems has been explored in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "matroid automorphism groups are computed for the root systems @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while @xcite considers the root system @xmath12 associated with the icosahedron and @xcite examines the matroid associated with the root system @xmath13 .",
    "the general case is treated in @xcite , where a computer program is employed to show that @xmath14 for all root systems @xmath2 _ except _ @xmath15 and @xmath1 , where @xmath16 is the coxeter / weyl group associated with @xmath2 and @xmath17 is either the 2-element group @xmath18 ( when @xmath19 has _ central inversion _ ) or @xmath17 is trivial ( when @xmath19 does not have central inversion ) .",
    "no attempt is made to understand the structure of these matroids in @xcite , however .",
    "other models for connecting geometric and combinatorial symmetry are possible , of course .",
    "in particular , since each pair of vectors @xmath20 in a root system corresponds to a double point in the associated linear matroid , we could consider both vectors in the matroid .",
    "this has the effect of doubling the number of automorphisms for each such pair ; in our case , this increases the number of automorphisms by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively , we could , associate an _ oriented _ matroid with the root system .",
    "this doubles the number of automorphisms considered here .",
    "another option is to consider a projective version of the root system .",
    "we point out , however , that all of these modifications differ from our treatment in transparent ways that do not change our understanding of the connection between the geometry and the combinatorics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the matroid @xmath0 is defined as the column dependence matroid for a @xmath22 matrix in section  [ s : def ] . in section  [",
    "s : flats ] , we describe the flats and _ orthoframes _ of the matroid and their incidence .",
    "orthoframes are special bases of the matroid , and they are important for understanding a certain kind of duality between points and 15-point planes .",
    "this point - plane correspondence is made explicit in propositions  [ p : orthodata](4 ) , [ p : planeeqns ] , and [ p : ptplanedual ] , where it is interpreted combinatorially , algebraically and geometrically , respectively .",
    "orthoframes also allow us to reconstruct the matroid - proposition  [ p : orthorecon ] .",
    "section  [ s : aut ] is the heart of this paper , concentrating on the structure of the matroid automorphisms .",
    "we show that the stabilizer of a point @xmath23 is @xmath24 ( lemma  [ l : stab ] ) , then use this to show that @xmath8 acts transitively on flats ( lemma  [ l : trans ] ) and primitively on the matroid ( theorem  [ t : prim ] ) .",
    "this allows us to understand the structure of the group - theorem  [ t : aut ] .",
    "we conclude ( section  [ s : geo ] ) with a few connections between the flats of the matroid and various classes of faces of the 120- and 600-cell .",
    "we would like to thank derek smith and david richter for useful discussions about the coxeter / weyl group @xmath17 for the @xmath1 root system .",
    "the third author especially thanks prof .",
    "thomas brylawski for teaching him about matroids and the beauty of symmetry groups .",
    "we assume some basic familiarity with matroids and root systems .",
    "we refer the reader to the first chapter of @xcite for an introduction to matroids and @xcite for much more on root systems .",
    "the study of root systems is very important for lie algebras , and the term ` root ' can be traced to characteristic roots of certain lie operators . for our purposes ,",
    "the collection of roots forms a matroid , and the coxeter / weyl group of the root system is closely related to the automorphism group of that matroid .",
    "the root system @xmath1 has an interpretation via two dual 4-dimensional regular polytopes , the 120-cell and the 600-cell .",
    "the 120-cell is composed of 120 dodecahedra and the 600-cell is composed of 600 tetrahedra .",
    "each vertex of the 120-cell is incident to precisely 3 dodecahedra and each vertex of the 600-cell meets 5 tetrahedra , justifying the intuitive notion that the 120-cell is a 4-dimensional analogue of the dodecahedron while the 600-cell is a 4-dimensional version of the icosahedron .    as dual polytopes , the 120-cell and the 600-cell have the same set of hyperplane reflections and symmetry groups .",
    "then the connection between these two dual solids and the root system @xmath1 is direct : the roots are precisely the normal vectors of all the reflecting hyperplanes that preserve the 120-cell ( or , dually , the 600-cell ) .",
    "a copy of this root system also appears as the collection of 120 vertices of the 600-cell ( where the 600-cell is positioned with the origin at its center and we identify a vertex with the vector from the origin to that vertex ) .",
    "extensive information about these polytopes appears in table 5 of the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the matroid @xmath0 is defined to be the linear dependence matroid on the set of 60 column vectors of the matrix @xmath25 over @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33\\ ] ]    the full root system @xmath1 consists of these 60 column vectors together with their 60 negatives . note that replacing any column vector by its negative does not change the matroid .",
    "8.7 of @xcite for more on the derivation of these coordinates .    since @xmath34",
    ", we can represent the matroid with an affine picture in @xmath35 .",
    "we find affine coordinates in @xmath35 as follows : first , find a non - singular linear transformation of the column vectors of @xmath1 that maps each vector to an ordered 4-tuple in which the first entry is non - zero , then project onto the plane @xmath36 and plot the remaining ordered triples .",
    "we note that choosing different transformations gives rise to different projections ; choosing the ` best ' such projection is subjective . in figure",
    "[ f : alllines ] , we give a projection of one such representation .",
    "we describe the rank-4 matroid @xmath0 by determining the number of flats of each kind and the flat incidence structure . this incidence structure will also be important for determining the automorphisms of the matroid .",
    "we use lower case letters to label the points of the matroid and upper case letters for flats of rank 2 or 3 .",
    "every line in @xmath0 has 2 , 3 or 5 points , and there are 4 different isomorphism classes of planes ( rank-3 flats ) in @xmath0 .",
    "the planes are shown in figure  [ f:3planes ] .",
    "this fact can be proven by a direct computation using the column dependences of the matrix @xmath25 .",
    "we comment briefly on some of these connections . for the root system @xmath12 ,",
    "this correspondence is explored in detail in @xcite . in that case , the roots are parallel to the edges of an icosahderon .",
    "this makes the matroid correspondence immediate : 3-point lines of the matroid correspond to pairs of triangles in the icosahedron and 5-point lines correspond to pairs of vertices of the icosahedron ( or pentagons of the dual dodecahedron ) .    the chief difficulty in applying the results of @xcite to @xmath1 arises from the fact that the edges of the 120-cell or 600-cell are no longer parallel to the roots .",
    "but , since each 15-point plane is isomorphic to @xmath41 as a matroid , the correspondence between dodecahedra and @xmath40 s is clear .",
    "we explain the connection between the 720 pentagons in the 120-cell and the 360 @xmath38 s in the matroid . in the 120-cell ,",
    "a given pentagon is in two dodecahedra , but in @xmath0 , a given 5-point line is in 5 @xmath40 s .",
    "we can `` correct '' this by using @xmath38 s , since each 5-point line of the matroid is in precisely five @xmath38 s .",
    "[ p : ptplanedual ] let @xmath42 be the collection of 15-point planes , and let @xmath43 be the bipartite graph with vertex set @xmath44 with an edge joining the point @xmath23 to the plane @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46",
    ". then @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear the bipartite graph @xmath43 allows us to reconstruct all the flats of the matroid , and any matroid automorphism acting on @xmath48 will necessarily be a graph automorphism of @xmath43 .",
    "further , we can swap the points and the planes ",
    "map a point @xmath23 to its orthoplane @xmath49 .",
    "we conclude by observing that it should be possible to treat matroids associated to other root systems ( especially the exceptional @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) in a coherent way that also explains the structure of those matroids .",
    "we hope to undertake such a program in the future ."
