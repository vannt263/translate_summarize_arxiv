    "is @xmath5 given by the sum of the internal energies of each species . in this context",
    ", the question of finding a global minimizer of the energy in the class of segregated states arises in a natural way .",
    "more precisely , if we define @xmath6^k:\\ , u_i\\geq 0,\\ u_i\\cdot u_j=0\\text { if    } i\\neq j,\\text { a.e . in } \\omega\\right\\},\\ ] ] we are led to the following _ optimal partition problem _ : @xmath7 this problem has been recently settled in @xcite , in connection with strongly competing variational systems of lotka - volterra type @xmath8 which , since the pioneering work of volterra , constitute one of the most studied theoretical models of population ecology , see @xcite . as a matter of fact , as the competition rate @xmath9 grows indefinitely , the components of any ( nonnegative ) solution of the system tend to separate their supports , leading to an element of @xmath10 ; in particular , the problem of finding minimal energy solutions of formally translates , as @xmath11 , into , see also @xcite .    in the understanding of the spatial behavior of interacting species , a central problem is to establish whether _ coexistence _ of all the species occurs , or the internal growth leads to _ extinction _ , that is , configurations where one or more densities are null : in this paper we address the question in the two different theoretical settings , endowing the models with null dirichlet boundary conditions : @xmath12 at a first insight , extinction has to be expected for competing systems which are , in a sense , too uniform .",
    "for instance , in the case of null neumann boundary conditions , the global minimum of @xmath13 on @xmath14 is in general achieved by configurations where only one species is alive , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1 ) .",
    "nonetheless , a mechanism to avoid extinction can be found in the spatial inhomogeneity of the territory . indeed , working in a special class of non - convex domains close to a union of @xmath0 disjoint balls ,",
    "the existence of _ local _ minima of @xmath15 where all the species are present is proven in @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the internal energies @xmath16 are not differentiated , extinction of global minimizers under null boundary conditions occurs in any domain , see section [ pf : nonexhistence ] :    [ th : nonexistence ] let @xmath17 be a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath18 be a lipschitz continuous function . if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then any global minimizer of @xmath15 on @xmath22 has at most one nonzero component .",
    "this motivates the question whether different internal laws might produce a mechanism to ensure coexistence . with the aim of providing a first answer to this conjecture , in this note we consider the special situation when the internal energies @xmath16 are of the same type but act at different density scales , see assumption .",

    "this is done with a great deal of generality both with respect to the domain and to the competing interaction term appearing in , see ( h1)(h3 ) below , but the dependence of @xmath16 s on @xmath9 does not allow recovering a meaningful coexistence result for the corresponding optimal partition problem , see remark [ rem : mod_cont ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the investigation of positive solutions to competitive systems in the case of @xmath25 densities is a challenging task and only partial results are known , see e.g. @xcite and the discussions therein for more references .    to investigate the possibility of coexistence for solutions to the optimal partition problem ( [ eq : opp ] ) , following an idea developed in @xcite to show the existence of sign - changing solutions to some elliptic equations , we focus on a certain class of ( possibly convex ) domains characterized by the presence of an angle .",
    "in this framework we prove , in theorem [ th : main - partition ] , that any global minimizer of @xmath15 among segregated states has _ at least two _ nontrivial positive components . although the result is not exhaustive for an arbitrary number of species , for systems of two populations it allows us to provide the full picture of the coexistence phenomenon ( theorem [ th : system2 ] ) .",
    "namely , we first prove that any minimal solution of system with @xmath26 is an equilibrium configuration where both the species are present , provided the scales of their internal energies are different but _ independent _ from the competition rate @xmath9 .",
    "hence we perform the asymptotic analysis as @xmath11 and prove that both components survive as the interspecific competition becomes larger and larger . as a result ,",
    "any minimal state of system converges to a spatially segregated distribution where the two densities coexist and solve the optimal partition problem .    in conclusion",
