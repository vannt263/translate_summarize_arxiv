    "bayesian statistical techniques are becoming increasingly popular in gravitational wave data analysis , and have shown great promise in tackling the various difficulties of gravitational wave ( gw ) source extraction from modeled data for the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "a powerful tool in the suite of bayesian methods is that of quantitative model selection  @xcite . to understand why this is a valuable feature consider a scenario where one is attempting to fit data with two competing models of differing dimension . in general",
    ", a higher dimensional model will produce a better fit to a given set of data .",
    "this can be taken to the limit where there are as many model parameters as there are data points allowing one to perfectly match the data .",
    "the problem then is to decide how many parameters are physically meaningful and to select the model containing only those parameters . in the context of gw detection",
    "these extra parameters could be additional physical parameters used to model the source or additional sources in the data . if a model is over - parameterized it will over - fit the data and produce spurious results .",
    "many of the model selection problems associated with lisa astronomy involve _ nested _ models , where the simpler model forms a subset of the more complicated model .",
    "the problem of determining the number of resolvable galactic binaries , and the problem of determining the number of measurable source parameters , are both examples of nested model selection .",
    "one could argue that the later is better described as `` approximation selection '' since we are selecting between different parameterizations of the full 17 dimensional physical model that describes the signals from binary systems of point masses in general relativity .",
    "however , many similar modeling problems in astrophysics and cosmology  @xcite , as well as in other fields such as geophysics  @xcite , are considered to be examples of model selection , and we will adopt that viewpoint here .    the lisa observatory  @xcite is designed to explore the low frequency portion of the gravitational wave spectrum between @xmath0 mhz .",
    "this frequency region will be heavily populated by signals from galactic binary systems composed of stellar mass compact objects ( e.g. white dwarfs and neutron stars ) , of which millions are theorized to exist .",
    "tens of thousands of these gw sources will be resolvable by lisa and the remaining sources will contribute to a confusion - limited background  @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be the dominant source of low frequency noise for lisa .",
    "detection and subsequent regression of the galactic foreground is of vital importance in order to then pursue dimmer sources that would otherwise be buried by the foreground . because of the great number of galactic sources , and the ensuing overlap between individual sources , a one - by - one detection / regression is inaccurate  @xcite .",
    "therefore a global fit to all of the galactic sources is required .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the number of resolvable sources one can not fix the model dimension _ a priori _ which presents a crucial model selection problem . over - fitting the data will result in an inaccurate regression which would then remove power from other sources in the data - stream , negatively impacting their detection and characterization .",
    "the reverse jump markov chain monte carlo approach to bayesian model selection has been used to determine the number of resolvable sources in the context of a toy problem  @xcite which shares some of the features of the lisa foreground removal problem .",
    "meanwhile the laplace approximation to bayesian model selection has been employed to estimate the number of resolvable sources as part of a mcmc based algorithm to extracting signals from simulated lisa data streams  @xcite .",
    "another important problem for gw astronomy is the determination of which parameters need to be included in the description of the waveforms .",
    "for example , the gw signal from a binary inspiral , as detected by lisa , may involve as many as 17 parameters .",
    "however , for massive black hole binaries of comparable mass we expect the eccentricity to be negligible , reducing the model dimension to 15 , while for extreme mass ratio systems we expect the spin of the smaller body to have little impact on the waveforms , reducing the model dimension to 14 . in many cases",
    "the inspiral signals may be described by even fewer parameters . for low mass galactic binaries",
    "spin effects will be negligible ( removing six parameters ) , and various astrophysical processes will have circularized the orbits of the majority of systems ( removing two parameters ) . of the remaining nine parameters , two",
    "describe the frequency evolution - _ e.g. _ the first and second time derivatives of the gw frequency , which may or may not be detectable  .    here",
    "we investigate the application of bayesian model selection to lisa data analysis in the context of determining the conditions under which the first time derivative of the gw frequency , @xmath1 , can be inferred from the data .",
    "we parameterize the signals using the eight parameters @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude , @xmath4 is the initial gravitational wave frequency , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ecliptic co - latitude and longitude , @xmath7 is the polarization angle , @xmath8 is the orbital inclination of the binary and @xmath9 is the gw phase .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 are evaluated at some fiducial time ( _ e.g. _ at the time the first data is taken ) . for our analysis",
    "only a single source is injected into the simulated data streams . in the frequency domain",
    "the output @xmath10 in channel @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the response of the detector to the incident gw and @xmath14 is the instrument noise .",
    "for our work we will assume stationary gaussian instrument noise with no contribution from a confusion background .",
    "in our analysis we use the noise orthogonal @xmath15 data streams , which can be constructed from linear combinations of the michelson type @xmath16 signals : @xmath17 this set of @xmath15 variables differ slightly from those constructed from the sagnac signals  @xcite . we do not use the @xmath18 channel in our analysis as it is insensitive to gws at the frequencies we are considering .",
    "the noise spectral density in the @xmath19 channels has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the acceleration noise @xmath22 and shot noise @xmath23 are simulated at the levels @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the lisa arm length ( @xmath26 m ) .    of central importance to bayesian analysis",
    "is the posterior distribution function ( pdf ) of the model parameters .",
    "the pdf @xmath27 describes the probability that the source is described by parameters @xmath28 given the signal @xmath29 . according to bayes theorem , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the _ a priori _ , or prior",
    ", distribution of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath32 is the likelihood that we measure the signal @xmath29 if the source is described by the parameters @xmath28 .",
    "we define the likelihood using the noise weighted inner product @xmath33 as @xmath34\\ ] ] where the normalization constant @xmath35 depends on the noise , but not the gw signal",
    ". one goal of the data analysis method is to find the parameters @xmath28 which maximizes the posterior .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods are ideal for this type of application  @xcite .",
    "the mcmc algorithm will simultaneously find the parameters which maximize the posterior and accurately map out the pdf of the parameters .",
    "this is achieved through the use of a metropolis - hastings  @xcite exploration of the parameter space .",
    "a brief description of this process is as follows : the chain begins at some random position @xmath36 in the parameter space and subsequent steps are made by randomly proposing a new position in the parameter space @xmath37 .",
    "this new position is determined by drawing from some proposal distribution @xmath38 .",
    "the choice of whether or not adopt the new position @xmath37 is made by calculating the hastings ratio ( transition probability ) @xmath39 and comparing @xmath11 to a random number @xmath40 taken from a uniform draw in the interval [ 0:1 ] .",
    "if @xmath11 exceeds @xmath40 then the chain adopts @xmath37 as the new position .",
    "this process is repeated until some convergence criterion is satisfied .",
    "the mcmc differs from a metropolis extremization by forbidding proposal distributions that depend on the past history of the chain .",
    "this ensures that the progress of the chain is markovian and therefore statistically unbiased .",
    "once the chain has stabilized in the neighborhood of the best fit parameters all previous steps of the chain are excluded from the statistical analysis ( these early steps are referred to as the `` burn in '' phase of the chain ) and henceforth the number of iterations the chain spends at different parameter values can be used to infer the pdf .",
    "the power of the mcmc is two - fold : because the algorithm has a finite probability of moving away from a favorable location in the parameter space it can avoid getting trapped by local features of the likelihood surface",
    ". meanwhile , the absence of any `` memory '' within the chain of past parameter values allows the algorithm to blindly , statistically , explore the region in the neighborhood of the global maximum .",
    "it is then rigorously proven that an mcmc will ( eventually ) perfectly map out the pdf , completely removing the need for user input to determine parameter uncertainties or thresholds .",
    "the parameter vector that maximizes the posterior distribution is stored as the maximum _ a posteriori _",
    "( map ) value and is considered to be the best estimate of the source parameters .",
    "note that because of the prior weighting in the definition of the pdf this is not necessarily the @xmath28 that yields the greatest likelihood . upon obtaining the map value for a particular model @xmath41 the pdf , now written as @xmath42 , can be employed to solve the model selection problem .",
    "the bayes factor @xmath43 @xcite is a comparison of the _ evidence _ for two competing models , @xmath41 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the marginal likelihood , or evidence , for model x. the bayes factor can then be calculated by @xmath46 the bayes factor has been described as the holy grail of model selection : it is a powerful entity that is very difficult to find .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 can be thought of as the odds ratio for a preference of model @xmath41 over model @xmath44 .    .@xmath43",
    "` confidence ' levels taken from  @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab4 ]    figure 6 shows the impact of the astrophysically motivated prior when the snr was held at 15 and four different injected values for @xmath47 were adopted , corresponding to the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and full width at quarter maximum ( fwqm ) of the prior distribution .",
    "the bayes factors listed in table iv indicate that for modestly loud sources with snr=15 the model selection techniques do not favor updating our estimate of the frequency derivative until the frequency derivative exceeds @xmath48 .",
    "we have found that the several common methods for estimating bayes factors give good agreement when applied to the the model selection problem of deciding when the data from the lisa observatory can be used to detect the orbital evolution of a galactic binary .",
    "the methods studied require varying degrees of effort to implement and calculate , and although found to be accurate in this test case , it is clear that some of these methods would be inappropriate approximations for more physically relevant examples .",
    "if a rjmcmc algorithm is used as the sole model selection technique , the resistance of the algorithm to change dimension , especially when making multi - dimensional jumps , can result in invalid model selection unless the chains are run for a very large numbers of steps . in",
    "the examples we studied the transdimensional jumps only had to span one dimension , and our basic rjmcmc algorithm performed well . however , a more sophisticated implementation , using _ e.g. _ rejection sampling or coupled chains , will be required to select the number of sources , as this requires jumps that span seven or more dimensions .    the laplace - metropolis method for approximating",
    "the model evidence is more robust than the commonly used fisher information matrix approximation of the hessian of the pdf .",
    "implementing an lm evidence estimation is a somewhat costly because of the need to fit the posterior to a minimum volume ellipsoid .",
    "the savage - dickie approximation is more economical than the rjmcmc or lm methods , but is limited by the requirement that the competing models _ must _ be nested .",
    "the bayes information criterion approximation to the evidence is by far the cheapest to implement , and is able to produce reliable results when the snr is high . it has therefore shown the most promise as an ` on the fly ' model determination scheme .",
    "more thorough ( and therefore more costly ) methods such as rjmcmc and lm could then be used to refine the conclusions initially made by the bic .",
    "our investigation using a strong astrophysical prior indicated that the gravitational wave signals will need to have high signal - to - noise ( @xmath49 ) , or moderate signal - to - noise ( @xmath50 ) and frequency derivatives far from the peak of the astrophysical distribution , in order to update our prior belief in the value of the frequency derivative .",
    "in other words , the frequency derivative will only been needed as a search parameter for a small number of bright high frequency sources .",
    "this work was supported by nasa grant nng05gi69 g .",
    "we are most grateful to gijs nelemans for providing us with data from his population synthesis studies .",

    "the fourier transform of the fast term can be done analytically : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 the cardinal sine function in ( [ fast_ft ] ) ensures that the fourier components @xmath111 away from resonance , @xmath112 , are quite small .",
