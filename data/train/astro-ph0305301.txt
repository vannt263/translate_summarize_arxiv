    "what is the origin of the nuclear star burst observed in many nearby massive galaxies ?",
    "theoretically , interaction of galaxies was shown to be one of the most efficient ways by which to fuel gas in the center of a galaxy and start a burst of star formation ( barns & hernquist 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) . from the point of view of observation",
    ", however , such scenario seems to fit only a fraction of the starburst galaxies in the nearby universe . in the markarian sample , for example ,",
    "keel & van soest ( 1992 ) have found that only 35% of the galaxies could be interacting with a nearby companion .",
    "a comparable fraction of non - isolated galaxies ( 24% ) was found in the mbg survey ( coziol et al .",
    "the rapid and short duration burst predicted by many interaction models seems also in contradiction with the relatively long period of star formation observed in most starburst galaxies ( coziol 1996 ; goldader et al .",
    "1997 ; coziol , doyon & demers 2001 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that other mechanisms , internal to the galaxies , must play a role in triggering or regulating star formation in these systems .",
    "the effect of a bar structure was frequently proposed as a possible burst mechanism .",
    "theoretically , the bar was shown to be capable of funnelling gas in the center of a galaxy and start a nuclear burst .",
    "this hypothesis was recently tested by considre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on a sample of 16 strongly barred markarian starburst nucleus galaxies ( sbng ) .",
    "the study of the oxygen and nitrogen gradients in these galaxies proved to be incompatible with the expected effect of a bar .",
    "instead , evidence was found that the bars appeared only recently as compared to the possible ages of the bursts . in an accompanying paper ,",
    "coziol et al . ( 2000 ) , it was shown that this phenomenon is typical of the whole markarian sbng sample",
    ". taken at face value , these observations suggest that a large fraction of the markarian galaxies may now be forming a disk .    it would be highly significant to know if the characteristics of the markarian sbng , as reported in coziol et al ( 2000 ) , are typical of all massive starburst galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "having previously defined a new sample of such objects , the pico dos dias ( pds ) starburst galaxies ( coziol et al 1998a ) , a comparison of their characteristics with those of the markarian sbng seemed , therefore , like the next logical step .",
    "the plan of the article is the following .",
    "section  2 explains the selection criteria used to define the two samples .",
    "the different particularities in the far - infrared ( fir ) and the physical characteristics that are compared are also presented and discussed in this section .",
    "the comparison of the two samples , supported by a statistical analysis , takes place in section  3 .",
    "this is followed , in section  4 , by a discussion on the possible causes of the differences observed .",
    "the consequences of these differences for the nature of the starburst phenomenon in nearby massive galaxies and for galaxies at higher redshift are also discussed in this section .",
    "a brief conclusion is presented in section  5 , followed by an appendix explaining in detail the results of the statistical tests used for this analysis .",
    "the main characteristics of the pds starburst galaxies were already presented and discussed in coziol et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "this sample consists of 200 galaxies , selected from the _ iras _ point source catalog using the following fir criteria : 1 ) all the galaxies have high or intermediate quality flux density at 12@xmath4 m , 25@xmath4 m , 60@xmath4 m and 100@xmath4 m ; 2 ) they have an infrared spectral index @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 and an infrared spectral index @xmath7 in the range @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the flux in janskys at wavelength @xmath11 ) . in coziol",
    "1998a ) it was shown that these criteria allow distinguishing starburst from agn galaxies with a confidence level approaching 99% .",
    "the pds starburst galaxies were found to be relatively luminous ( m@xmath12 ) .",
    "the fact that the fir criteria introduce a strong bias against dwarf starburst galaxies ( h*ii * galaxies ) is not surprising , considering the low metallicity and dust content of these galaxies ( salzer , macalpine & gordon 1988 ) .",
    "the physical parameters that are considered in this article were all taken from the same source : the lyon meudon extragalactic database ( _ leda _ ) . in _ leda _ , raw data , having a different origin , are homogenized , using specific rules , to form a uniform catalogue(_leda _ is the basis of the _ rc3 _ catalogue of galaxies ) .",
    "a complete description of the normalization process used in _ leda _ can be found in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and paturel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . keeping only galaxies for which complete information ( except for kinematics ) is available in _ leda _",
    "reduces the number of pds starburst galaxies to 168 .",
    "the comparison sample of markarian sbng is composed of all the galaxies with m@xmath12 , having , like for the pds , information in _",
    "leda_. this yields a sample of 505 galaxies . comparing the redshift of these galaxies with those of the pds in figure  1 , it is obvious that the markarian are located at higher redshift . to eliminate the effects of malmquist bias , a limit on the distance must be applied . for comparison ,",
    "therefore , only galaxies which are nearer than 7500 km s@xmath1 are kept in the two samples ( this corresponds to 100 mpc , adopting h@xmath13 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "this limit was chosen in order to exclude the smallest number of pds galaxies , while keeping the largest number of markarian galaxies .",
    "this reduce the final pds and markarian samples to 154 galaxies and 325 galaxies respectively .",
    "m as a function of the redshift for the markarian sbng and pds starburst galaxies ; b ) detected flux at 25@xmath4 m as a function of the redshift for the markarian sbng and pds starburst galaxies .",
    "the continuous lines are linear regressions on the markarian flux values .",
    "the detected fluxes for the markarian sbng are always lower than those for the pds .",
    "note that the slope of the regression goes contrary to what is expected for an observational bias . ]"
