    "among the different notions of quasi - local mass , the tolman mass has the advantage that when dealing with a horizonless object ( like a star / planet / monster / gravastar / black star / quasi - black hole ) in a static spacetime , it can ultimately be bounded in terms of quantities measurable in the surface of the object @xcite ; particularly the average surface gravity and the total area . in any static spacetime where the metric can be put into the form",
    "@xmath0 the tolman mass @xcite inside a region @xmath1 is defined in terms of the diagonal components of the stress - energy tensor as follows : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the determinant of the @xmath4-dimensional metric .",
    "the einstein equations then imply @xmath5 which is a purely geometrical statement .",
    "now , it is possible to rewrite the tolman mass in terms of the three - acceleration of a specific set of fiducial observers ( fidos ) .",
    "first consider the set of fidos with four - velocity parallel to the time - like killing vector @xmath6 , @xmath7 their four - acceleration is given by @xmath8 that is , @xmath9 , since @xmath10 is four - orthogonal to @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , consider the raychaudhuri equation for this timelike congruence : @xmath12 here the expansion @xmath13 , shear expansion @xmath14 , and vorticity @xmath15 of the congruence are defined as usual . in terms of the spatial projection operator @xmath16 we have : @xmath17}\\,h_{db } & ; & \\qquad \\omega^2= { 1\\over2}\\,\\omega_{ab}\\,\\omega^{ab}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , since @xmath18 in view of killing s equation , we have @xmath19 therefore @xmath20 , and consequently @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we also have @xmath23 , that is , in the notation of differential forms @xmath24 .",
    "this implies @xmath25 and consequently @xmath26 ( the congruence of fidos is hypersurface orthogonal ) , implying @xmath27 .",
    "thus in this situation the timelike raychaudhuri equation implies @xmath28 this finally reduces to the well known landau ",
    "lifshitz result  @xcite , @xmath29 now using ordinary partial derivative integration by parts , for any @xmath30volume @xmath1 the tolman mass can be rewritten as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unit normal , and @xmath33 is the induced area measure on @xmath34 .",
    "we now consider a generalization of the surface gravity .",
    "one method to obtain the usual static surface gravity is by considering the magnitude of the four - acceleration of a suitable set of fidos , and renormalizing it using a suitable redshift factor . here",
    ", instead we take the three spatial components of such four - acceleration to build a three - vector @xmath35 with magnitude @xmath36 .",
    "this generalized surface gravity retains the _ usual _ physical interpretation of the surface gravity , but is not only valid for any event horizon present  this definition now also applies to fidos on the ( arbitrary ) boundary @xmath34 .",
    "the tolman mass is @xmath37 furthermore , defining an average surface gravity over the boundary @xmath34 , @xmath38 and total area @xmath39 , and assuming there are no black holes regions , we finally have @xmath40 this is a bound on the total tolman mass of a horizonless object ( such as a star , or a planet , or a monster @xcite , or a gravastar @xcite , or a black star @xcite , or a quasi  black hole @xcite ) in a general static geometry , which only depends on quantities measurable on its surface .",
    "to take thermodynamics into account , and calculate a bound on the entropy of these types of object , we now need to consider the euler ( gibbs  duhem ) relation for the entropy density of the matter forming the horizonless object , @xmath41 where ( as usual ) we have set @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to remember that the whole discussion in centered in some collection of ideal particles making up an uncollapsed object like a star / planet / monster / gravastar / black star / quasi - black hole .",
    "the total entropy due to this kind of matter inside any specific @xmath30volume is @xmath44 the tolman @xcite , ( tolman  ehrenfest  @xcite ) , and tolman ",
    "klein @xcite equilibrium conditions @xmath45 imply @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the total number of particles inside the @xmath30volume .",
    "thermodynamic stability requires the chemical potential to be @xmath48 , then @xmath49 where we have assumed @xmath50 throughout the interior .",
    "this last numerator is just equivalent to the definition of the tolman mass .",
    "we see that the total entropy is bounded by the tolman mass divided by the temperature as measured at infinity .",
    "furthermore from the previous discussion this entropy bound can be rephrased in terms of the average generalized surface gravity @xmath52 , and the total area @xmath39 , @xmath53    finally we invoke the only semiclassical notion we use throughout the calculations , to relate the surface gravity to a temperature , via the unruh effect @xcite . due to the existence of the unruh acceleration radiation phenomenon",
    ", it can be asserted that an observer on the boundary @xmath34 will measure a minimum local temperature of @xmath54 which when redshifted to infinity implies @xmath55 so the equilibrium temperature of the object confined inside @xmath34 satisfies @xmath56 hence the entropy is bounded by _ one half _ of the total area @xmath39 , @xmath57",
    "we have bounded the entropy of an object without horizons , in static spacetime , by half of its total area .",
    "although the construction of this entropy bound is very minimalist , it is closely related to the usual entropy bounds @xcite .",
    "specifically , it resembles the holographic bound @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "the fundamental reason for the coefficient mismatch between these two bounds is because we calculated the entropy of a uncollapsed distribution of matter , where the temperature has its normal interpretation as an intensive variable , and the euler relation keeps its usual uncollapsed form .",
    "further generalizations of this entropy bound , where a black hole region is taken into account , can be found in @xcite .",
    "overall , the importance of this entropy bound , for an uncollapsed distribution of matter , resides in its simplicity and its robustness .",
