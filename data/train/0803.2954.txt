    "entanglement is an essential feature of quantum mechanics , which distinguishes quantum from classical world .",
    "a key property of entanglement as well as one of the fundamental differences between quantum entanglement and classical correlations is the degree of sharing among many parties unlike classical correlations , quantum entanglement is monogamous [ 1 - 3 ] , i.e. , the degree to which either of two parties can be entangled with anything else seems to be constrained by the entanglement that may exist between the two quantum parties . for the systems of three qubits ,",
    "a kind of monogamy of bipartite quantum entanglement measured by concurrence [ 4 ] was described by coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) inequality [ 1 ] .",
    "the generalization to the case of multiple qubits was conjectured by ckw and has been proven recently by osborne et al [ 5 ] .",
    "the monogamy inequality dual to ckw inequality based on concurrence of assistance ( coa ) [ 6 ] was presented for tripartite systems of qubits by gour et al [ 7 ] and the generalized one for multiple qubits was proven in ref . [ 8 ] . in this paper",
    ", we find a new and very interesting monogamy equation for @xmath2-dimensional ( or multiple qubits ) quantum pure states which relates the bipartite concurrence , coa and genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "in fact , ckw inequality and the dual one correspond to a residual quantity , respectively .",
    "it is only for tripartite pure states of qubits that so far the two residual quantities have been shown to be the same and have clear physical meanings . from ref .",
    "[ 1 ] and [ 6 ] , one can learn that it just corresponds to 3-tangle [ 1 ] .",
    "one of the distinguished advantages of our monogamy equation will be found that the residual quantity has clear physical meanings not only for @xmath2-dimensional quantum pure state but also for a general multipartite pure state including a pair of qubits .",
    "recently it has been realized that entanglement is a useful physical resource for various kinds of quantum information processing [ 9 - 12 ] .",
    "based on the different physics of implementation , there are usually three alternative ways [ 7 ] to producing entanglement .",
    "the specially important way for quantum communication is the reduction of a multipartite entangled state to an entangled state with fewer parties , which is called `` assisted entanglement '' quantified by entanglement of assistance ( eoa ) [ 13 ]",
    ". an important application of eoa is for tripartite quantum entangled state to maximize the entanglement of two parties ( qubits ) denoted by alice and bob with the assistance of the third party ( qudit ) named charlie who is only allowed to do local operations .",
    "however , because eoa is not an entanglement monotone [ 14 ] , one would prefer to the remarkable entanglement monotoneconcurrence of assistance ( coa ) where concurrence is employed to quantify the entanglement between alice and bob . in this process of entanglement preparation ,",
    "charlie only makes local operations and classical communications in order to increase the entanglement shared by alice and bob , therefore it is impossible to produce new entanglement .",
    "there must exist some trade - off between the increment of entanglement shared by alice and bob induced by charlie and quantum correlations with other forms .",
    "then what are those ?",
    "the question is answered in this paper by our interesting monogamy equation . from the equation",
    ", one can find that the increment of entanglement shared by alice and bob just corresponds to the degree of genuine tripartite entanglement ( 3-way entanglement ) of @xmath3- dimensional quantum pure state and is analytically calculable .",
    "hence , the increment naturally characterizes the genuine tripartite entanglement , which is shown to be an entanglement monotone and can be considered as an interesting generalization of 3-tangle in terms of a new idea .",
    "in addition , the monogamy equation is reduced to a monogamy inequality for mixed states .",
    "the results are also suitable for multipartite quantum states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce our interesting monogamy equation for pure states ; then for mixed states , we reduce this monogamy equation for pure state to a monogamy inequality ; next we point out these results are suitable for multipartite quantum states ; the conclusion is drawn finally .",
    "given a tripartite @xmath2- dimensional quantum pure state @xmath4 shared by three parties alice , bob and charlie , where charlie s aim is to maximize the entanglement shared by alice and bob by local measurements on charlie s particle c , the reduced density matrix by tracing over party c can be given by @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 is any a decomposition of @xmath8 such that @xmath9then coa is defined [ 5,6 ] by @xmath10where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is pauli matrix and @xmath13 is the concurrence of the reduced density matrix @xmath8 with @xmath14 being the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath15 in decreasing order . with the definitions of coa and concurrence ,",
    "we can obtain the following theorem .    * theorem 1 : * _ for a _",
    "@xmath2__- dimensional quantum pure state _ _",
    "@xmath4 _ _ , _ _ @xmath16__where _ _ @xmath17 _ _  is the genuine tripartite entanglement measure for _ _ @xmath4__. _ _    it is very interesting that eq .",
    "( 6 ) has an elegant form that is analogous to pythagorean theorem if one considers coa as the length of the hypotenuse of a right - angled triangle and considers bipartite concurrence and genuine tripartite entanglement as the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle .",
    "note that the lengths of all the sides are allowed to be zero .",
    "the illustration of the relation is shown in fig . 1 ( see the left triangle ) .",
    "* according to the definition of coa and concurrence , it is obvious that @xmath18then the remaining is to prove that @xmath19 is an entanglement monotone and characterizes the genuine tripartite entanglement of @xmath4 .",
    "next , we first prove that @xmath19 does not increase under a general tripartite local operation and classical communication ( locc ) denoted by @xmath20 where subscript @xmath21 labels different outcomes .",
    "we first assume that alice and bob perform quantum operations @xmath22 , and @xmath23 on their qubits respectively , where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath24 @xmath26 are the most general local operations given in terms of the kraus operator [ 15 ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the identity operators in alice s and bob s systems .",

    "now we prove that @xmath44 characterizes genuine tripartite entanglement .",

    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) , it is obvious that @xmath45which is an explicit formulation .",

    "the proof is completed.@xmath46    in general , multipartite entanglement is quantified in terms of different classifications [ 19 - 21 ] .",
    "however , @xmath47 quantifies genuine tripartite entanglement in a new way , i.e. , we consider the entanglement of ghz - state class as the minimal unit [ 22 ] in terms of tensor treatment [ 23 ] and summarize all the genuine tripartite inseparability without further classifications .",
    "it is an interesting generalization of 3-tangle .",
    "* theorem 1 * shows a very clear physical meaning , i.e. the increment of entanglement between alice and bob induced by charlie is just the genuine tripartite entanglement among them .",
    "the meaning can especially easily be understood for tripartite quantum state of qubits . in this case ,",
    "two most obvious examples are ghz state and w state .",
    "the entanglement of reduced density matrix of ghz state is zero , hence * theorem 1 * shows that the coa of ghz state all comes from the three - way entanglement and equals to 1 ( the value of 3-tangle ) . on the contrary",
    ", the w state has no three - way entanglement ( only two - way entanglement ) [ 24 ] , hence its coa is only equal to the concurrence ( @xmath49 ) of two parties .",
    "that is to say , for w state , charlie can not provide any help to increase the entanglement between alice and bob .",
    "for a given mixed state @xmath50 , coa can be extended to mixed states in terms of convex roof construction [ 15 ] , i.e. , @xmath51where the minimum is taken over all decompositions @xmath52 of @xmath50 .",

    "( 19 ) finishes the proof .",
    "any a given @xmath63-partite quantum state can always be considered as a @xmath64- dimensional tripartite quantum states with @xmath65 denoting the total dimension of @xmath66 subsystems so long as the state includes at least two qubits , hence both the two theorems hold in these cases . however , it is especially worthy of being noted that the two qubits must be owned by alice and bob respectively and the other @xmath66 subsystems should be at charlie s hand and be considered as a whole .",
    "charlie is allowed to perform any nonlocal operation on the @xmath66 subsystems .",
    "in addition , there may be different groupings [ 25 ] of a multipartite quantum state especially for multipartite quantum states of qubits , hence there exist many analogous monogamy equations ( for pure states ) or monogamy inequalities ( for mixed states ) for the same quantum state .",
    "for pure states , every monogamy equation will lead to a genuine @xmath67- dimensional tripartite entanglement monotone that quantifies the genuine tripartite entanglement of the tripartite state generated by the corresponding grouping .",
    "we have presented an interesting monogamy equation with elegant form for @xmath68- dimensional quantum pure states , which , for the first time , reveals the relation among bipartite concurrence , coa and genuine tripartite entanglement .",
