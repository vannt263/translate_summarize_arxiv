    "vepp-2 m is the @xmath0-collider @xcite , operating since 1974 in the energy range 2e=0.41.4 gev ( @xmath10-mesons region ) .",
    "its maximum luminosity is about @xmath11 at e=510 mev .",
    "two detectors snd and cmd-2 carry out experiments at vepp-2 m now .",
    "snd was described in detail in @xcite .",
    "its main part is the three layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 1620 nai(tl ) crystals with a total mass of 3.6 tones .",
    "the solid angle coverage of the calorimeter is 90% of @xmath12 steradian .",
    "the energy resolution for photons can be approximated as @xmath13 , angular resolution is about @xmath14 .",
    "the angles of charged particles are measured by two cylindrical drift chambers covering 98% of @xmath12 solid angle .    since 1996",
    "the snd detector collected @xmath15 of integrated luminosity in three energy regions :    * 360970 mev , @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath17 produced @xmath18 mesons and @xmath19 @xmath20 mesons ; * 9801060 mev , @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 @xmath2 meson decays ; * 10501380 mev , @xmath16 .    in this report we present results based on analysis of total statistics from last two energy regions and @xmath23 from @xmath18 , @xmath20 region .",
    "the decays of the vector mesons into a scalar and a photon are well known for higher quarkonia , but there are very little data about such decays of light mesons @xmath24 .",
    "the scalar candidates for their decays are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and not well established broad object @xmath27 . + * the decays @xmath28 . * the first evidence of the electric dipole decays of @xmath2 meson",
    "was reported by snd detector in 1997 @xcite .",
    "these decays were searched for in the reactions : @xmath29 @xmath30 on the base of the analysis of full snd data sample collected in the @xmath2 meson energy region the following branching ratios were obtained from the study of the reactions ( [ pp0 g ] ) , ( [ etpg ] ) @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 corresponding numbers of selected events were @xmath33 for the process ( [ pp0 g ] ) and @xmath34 for the process ( [ etpg ] ) .",
    "the angular distributions of these events were found to be in agreement with expected for scalar intermediate @xmath35 and @xmath36 states .",

    "these enhancements can be explained by only resonant contribution of @xmath25 , @xmath26 mesons .",
    "the @xmath35 mass spectrum was approximated by sum of contributions from @xmath25 and @xmath39 mesons with a small addition of @xmath40 mechanism calculated using vdm .",
    "the @xmath25 shape was described by flatte @xcite type formula @xcite taking into account the nearness of @xmath41 threshold .",
    "results of the approximation in the two models are shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the point - like model of @xmath42 transition which can not give satisfactory description of the data ( @xmath43 ) , the model with the intermediate kaon loop @xcite",
    "well reproduce the shape of experimental spectrum even without the additional contribution of @xmath39 meson ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the similar model was applied to describe the @xmath36 mass spectrum in fig .",

    "the fitting results demonstrate that @xmath45 and @xmath46 mechanisms dominate in the decays ( [ pp0 g ] ) , ( [ etpg ] ) .",

    "it is hard to explain the relatively large values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the frame of a conventional two - quark description of @xmath52 and @xmath53 structure ( see discussion in the work @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath51 is close to @xmath54 .",
    "so , the isovector @xmath53 should contain strange quarks like @xmath55 !",

    "it is well described by @xmath67 dependence expected for @xmath68-wave state of @xmath35 pair .",
    "but the problem is that in this energy range the @xmath68-wave contribution is dominant for all intermediate states including @xmath40 .",

    "an inclusion of the energy dependent width in the model 2 leads to significant growth of resulting mass and width of the exited state . only in model 1 with @xmath89 the parameters @xmath90 meson are compatible with their pdg values , but this model yields a poorest @xmath91 value : @xmath92 . the satisfactory description of the experimental data was obtained in model 3 with two excited states .",

    "fitting of the same experimental data by models with fixed and energy - dependent total widths of the excited states yields quite different parameters of these states .",
    "this is caused by strong energy dependence of the phase space for the main decay modes of @xmath90 and @xmath105 mesons and this effect should be taken into account in the fitting of experimental data . to obtain more definite values of the parameters of @xmath18 and @xmath20 exited states new experimental data at higher energies @xmath106 mev are needed .",
