    "low mass x - ray binaries are for the majority of the time in a state of quiescensce with faint or non - detected x - ray emission , though optical or near - infrared ( nir ) counterparts may be visible due to emission from the donor star , or possibly the jet , hot spot , or outer accretion disk .",
    "they are often only discovered when they enter an active state of outburst when  powered by an increased level of accretion onto the central , compact object ( black hole or neutron star )  there is a dramatic increase of the x - ray , optical / nir and radio flux . during these outbursts the systems",
    "have been observed to go through a number of high energy spectral states before returning to a quiescent state , usually on times scales of weeks , months or even longer .",
    "these states are a generally low intensity , power - law dominated , _ hard _ state followed by a usually , higher intensity , _ thermal - dominant _ , _ soft _ state which decreases in flux , via a late hard state , over time .",
    "additionally , the hard states are associated with aperiodic variability of the light curve not present in the soft state ( see @xcite for a fuller description of the various possible states ) .",
    "xtej1752 - 223 , a new x - ray transient and black hole candidate @xcite in the galactic center region , was detected on 2009 - 10 - 23 at 19:55 ut ( mjd 55128.33 ) by rxte and on 2009 - 10 - 24 at 14:18:50 ut by the bat instrument on board the _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the high energy , variable emission of the source was confirmed in the following days by _",
    "swift_/xrt @xcite and rxte @xcite as well as by maxi / gsc @xcite and _",
    "fermi_/gbm @xcite .",
    "an optical and nir counterpart was proposed by @xcite while a radio source coincident with the x - ray position @xcite was observed by the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; @xcite ) .",
    "the source was observed to have undergone a state transition in mid - january 2010 ( mjd @xmath0 ; @xcite ) , from a spectrally hard to a spectrally soft x - ray state .",
    "this was identified by a de - coupling of high energy ( @xmath1kev ) and low energy ( @xmath2kev ) light curves @xcite which had previously traced each other , and by the dominance of a thermal component .",
    "the source was observed to have reverted to a hard state at the end of march 2010 ( mjd @xmath3 ; @xcite ) , after the low energy light curve decreased to trace once more the high energy light curve ; the thermal component was no longer dominant .",
    "it has also been suggested that the turn - on of a compact jet has been observed in this system @xcite during this transition back to the low / hard state .    in this article",
    "we present the _ swift _  burst alert telescope , x - ray telescope and ultraviolet / optical telescope  monitoring observations of xtej1752 - 223 , obtained over the period of the outburst . based on these data ,",
    "we identify the periods of the various states and compare the behavior of the major photometric , spectral and timing parameters during these states to those expected from black hole x - ray binaries . in section [ section : observations ]",
    "we introduce the observations and reduction methods , while in section [ section : analysis ] we present the results of our photometric , spectral and timing analyses of the data .",
    "we summarise our findings in section [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "_ swift _ @xcite observed xtej1752 - 223 with its narrow field instruments , the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , on 55 epochs from october 25 to november 03 2009 and from february 04 2010 to june 5 2010 . these observations",
    "( under target ids 31532 , 31640 and 31688 ) coincide with the period of the outburst .",
    "observations with the narrow field instruments were interrupted for 3 months due to the source becoming constrained by the position of the sun .",
    "wide field instruments also became sun constrained but at a later date and for a shorter period of time , depending on the satellite and instrument in question ( e.g. maxi was constrained from december 15 to 24 ) . during the period of the outburst , as it had been on previous occasions , the field was also being observed ( though constrained from december 13 to 28 ) by _ swift _ s burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) which , in combination with xrt and uvot , affords quasi - simultaneous observations from 0.002 to 150 kev .",
    "reduction of _ swift _ data was carried out using version 3.4 of the _ swift _ software , released as part of heasoft 6.7 .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "uvot data have been pre - processed at the _ swift _ data center ( see @xcite ) and require only minimum user processing . as the pointing of _",
    "swift _ is only accurate to a few arcseconds , the standard pre - process pipeline provides an astrometric correction by matching sources with the usno - b catalog .",
    "however , in this case the automatic matching failed because the field differs significantly between the ultraviolet and the usno - b bandpass . to overcome this , we created our own astrometric reference catalog by selecting blue and bright field stars in the gsc-2.3 catalog @xcite to determine astrometric corrections for the data .",
    "the image data of each filter , from each observation sequence , i.e. , with a given observation i d , were summed using uvotimsum .",
    "all sequences were then combined in an individual fits file , using fappend , which was again summed using uvotimsum to obtain a deep image of the field in each filter . from these images ,",
    "two possible optical counterparts of xtej1752 - 223 are identified , consistent with the x - ray position @xcite ; source a , consistent with the counterpart proposed by @xcite , is within @xmath4 and source b is within @xmath5 of the x - ray position .",
    "the positions ( j2000 ; 0.31error ) of the possible counterparts were derived from such a deep ( 1853s ) @xmath6 band image summed between mjd 55130 and 55138 ( figure [ fig : uvot_v ] ) , using the uvotdetect command , as : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      the xrt windowed timing mode ( wt ; @xcite ) event data [ 0.3 - 10kev ] were analysed using the tools presented by @xcite .",
    "these correct for pile up and the affect of bad ccd columns .",
    "version v011 response matrices were used for the spectral analysis . the best xrt position of 17:52:15.14 @xmath722:20:33.8 ( j2000",
    "; 3.1error ) is as previously reported @xcite .",
    "background subtracted xrt count rate light curves are binned per observing sequence ( figure[fig : xray_lc ] ; combined with maxi observations ) .",
    "unbinned source light curves ( not background subtracted ) , for each sequence , were used to produce power density spectra ( pds ) and to calculate the rms variability with the ftools , powspec and lcstats respectively . within each of these",
    "the binning was set to be n times the minimum bin size ( 1.766ms ) where n=1 for the pds and n=8 ( 14.128ms ) for the rms variability , giving frequency ranges of 0.02 - 570hz and 0.02 - 70hz respectively .",
    "the average pds were calculated , within powspec , from an input list of the light curves of the required sequences , using the same binning .",
    "lags between the standard xrt low [ 0.3 - 1.5kev ] and high [ 1.5 - 10kev ] energy band unbinned light curves were calculated with crosscor and a bin size set to n=8 ( 14.128ms ) .",
    "bat detector plane histograms ( dphs ) were obtained in survey mode ; these are 2 dimensional images with full spectral data and coarse time binning .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted from these dphs using mask weighting ( also known as ray - tracing ) to account for the position of the source on the coded aperture mask .",
    "the data were initially processed with the ftool , batsurvey which applies data quality cuts and uses the tools batfftimage and batcelldetect to extract 8-channel spectra for the source .",
    "we then used custom software to format the spectra for xspec , and batdrmgen to generate the response files .",
    "the light curve was derived using a similar method .",
    "bat , as a survey telescope , had been observing the field of xtej1752 - 223 since the start of _ swift _ operations in january 2006 , though not monitoring the source . the extracted bat light curve ( 15 - 150kev ) of the source from january 12 2006 through to the present , displays no activity until the 2009 outburst .",
    "the joint xrt - bat spectra were fit within xspec ( 12.5.1 ) , using c - statistics and interstellar absorption modeled by tbabs ; initially we fit an absorbed power law ( pow ) to the spectra before adding a thermal component ( diskbb ) .",
    "we note that these are phenomenological models for the respective spectral states , not a suggestion that these are necessarily the best physical models ; they should not be used to deduce physical constraints but only as an indication of the spectral state of the source .    the early data ( mjd 55131 - 55138 ) are well described by the power law of average photon index , @xmath8 , ( figure[fig : spectral ] ) and do not require a thermal component - clearly indicating that the source is in the hard state .",
    "the absorption of a simultaneous fit of these sequences is @xmath9@xmath10 , greater than the galactic value of @xmath11@xmath10 but lower than the @xmath12@xmath10 found by @xcite .",
    "data observed from mjd 55234 - 55280 additionally support a soft state thermal component decreasing from a temperature of @xmath13kev to @xmath14kev over the period , as well as decreasing normalisation . due to the degeneracy between the power law and the thermal components and lack of counts from the bat ,",
    "the power law index is poorly constrained in a manner not obvious from the nominal fit errors but causing a high level of variability in the upper panel of figure[fig : spectral ] ; these values are not reliable .    from mjd 55283",
    "the data no longer support a thermal component , though the signal to noise at these low counts rates can not rule out a thermal component .",
    "additionally , as can be seen from figure[fig : spectral ] , the power law indices are decreasing until mjd 55328 , signaling the transitional period between the soft and hard states , in agreement with the increasing hardness ratio ( figure[fig : xray_lc ] ) . from mjd 55328 to the end of our observations , on mjd 55352 , the spectra are described by a power law of relatively constant photon index , the average of which is @xmath15 .",
    "the power law indices and the hardness ratios at these late times fail to return to the original , rising hard state values ( @xmath8 ) , indicating that , though the count rate is lower than it was in that rising hard state , the source has not yet returned to its original hard state or that the late hard state has marginally different spectral properties .",
    "an optical and nir counterpart was proposed by @xcite based on a comparison between their images and those from the digitized sky survey , 2mass and ukidss .",
    "we have confirmed uvot source a as this optical counterpart on the basis of a significant , though low amplitude variability in the @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands ( figure[fig : uvot_lc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these optical magnitudes , or count rates , exhibit a power - law correlation with the x - ray count rate , as observed by xrt at times after mjd 55232 ( figure[fig : uvot - xrt ] ) , i.e. , when the source is in the soft state and later , during the transition to the late hard state . the earlier , hard state data does not fit on this correlation , but displays hysteretical behaviour and for the given x - ray count rate it spans has a significantly higher magnitude in all bands .",
    "this is similar to the hysteretical behaviour observed in the nir for a number of transients @xcite , most notably xtej1550 - 564 , where the additional hard state emission is attributed to optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet @xcite , which would be quenched in the soft state ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and weak at low x - ray luminosities , leading to the hysteresis .",
    "though this hysteresis is not normally observed in the optical bands , the optical data presented here is in good agreement with the synchrotron emitting jet making a significant contribution to the optical emission in the rising hard state .",
    "while the observed @xmath6 band brightening from mjd 55292 corresponds to the suggested turn - on , in nir , of a compact jet between mjd 55293 and 55298 @xcite , it is not corroborated by the other bands and is not statistically significant , though it may indicate the turn - on of a jet and the transition to the hard state ; at such low x - ray luminosity levels , the jet contribution to the optical would be minimal .    from a simultaneous fit of the @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "bands the correlation is found to be @xmath18 with observed colours of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , though the individual bands display indices of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , hinting at possible spectral evolution .",
    "such a correlation is more usually associated with the hard state @xcite but we can not say if the early , hard state data follows another correlation ( expected to be @xmath25 ; @xcite ) due to the very limited range of magnitudes and x - ray count rates over this period . though we find a correlation between the optical and x - ray , we can not imply causality or say which leads without a study of the phase lag between the two bands , which is not possible given the time resolution of the optical data . similarly a timing analysis to investigate variability of the optical data is not possible .",
    "the correlation may be due to reprocessing of the x - rays or through both originating from the accretion disk ; it is also possible that optical emission in the soft state originates from a jet , the state of which traces the spectral states @xcite    the quality of the uvot spectral data does not support any spectral evolution in the optical , nor does it enable us to specify the most appropriate spectral model for the source such as a power law associated with the above suggested jet emission .",
    "hence , we model the data phenomenologically in xspec , by a power law ( @xmath26 ) and a dust extinction component ( zdust ) , though we note that this is not a particularly good fit .",
    "given that an unknown amount of galactic extinction , @xmath27 @xcite , effects the data we can only place limits on the spectral index of @xmath28 , though the nominal best fit is at @xmath29 for @xmath30 . given the uncertainties of the spectral slope and the lack of phase lag information , we are unable to make a meaningful comparison to the predictions of the various models .      the hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) for both the xrt data [ 1.5 - 10kev / 0.3 - 1.5kev ] and the quasi - simultaneous ( same day ) bat / maxi data starting at the same time are shown in figure[fig : hid ] .",
    "due to the fact that the bat / maxi data are only quasi - simultaneous , the hardness ratio ( hr ) of bat [ 15 - 150kev ] with respect to maxi [ 4 - 10kev ] at low bat count rates ( @xmath31 ) , where the relative variability over a day is greater , are underestimated by the error bars . in general , hids follow a canonical trajectory ( e.g. , @xcite ) : increasing intensity at a high hr to a maximum in the hard state , indicating the power law shape of the spectra ; decrease of hr at a high intensity through an intermediate state as the thermal component of the spectra becomes more dominant ; decrease of intensity at the low hr level during the soft state ; before the hr increases at low intensity , through an intermediate state , to the original value .",
    "this is consistent with both the xrt data , though a significant amount of the trajectory in the first intermediate state is missing due to the source being sun constrained for a period of 3 months , and the bat / maxi data in which the final phase is obscured due to the large error bars on the hr .",
    "it is clear from the xrt hid that the hardness has yet to increase to the original value , indicating that the source has not yet returned to its original hard state , though the count rate is lower than it was in that rising hard state , or that the late hard state has different properties .",
    "these tracks are common among black hole binary sources  though are also observed in neutron star binary sources such as aquilax-1 ( e.g. , @xcite )  and further confirm the spectral state of the system over the periods in question .",
    "the rms variation of the light curves exhibit a similar evolution to hardness ratio ( figure[fig : xray_lc ] ) , from average rms @xmath32 per cent in the observed period of the rising hard state ( mjd 55131 - 55138 ) to @xmath33 percent during the soft state observations and increasing to the original levels at later times . examining the light curves in the standard xrt low [ 0.3 - 1.5kev ] and",
    "high [ 1.5 - 10kev ] energy bands we find that , during the rising hard state this variability is more pronounced in the low band with an average ratio between the two of @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests an energy dependency of rms variation , in contrast to @xcite who find a flat rms spectrum @xcite from xte data at energies in the range 2 - 10kev .",
    "the lag between the two bands , calculated via a cross correlation , is consistent with zero in all cases though is not tightly constrained .    examining the average power density spectra of the states ( figure[fig : powspec ] )",
    "we see that the hard state has a high level of power in low frequency ( @xmath35hz ) variability , though there is no significant sign of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "the soft state , on the other hand , has a much lower lever of power and only at frequencies @xmath36hz , as is manifested by the @xmath33 percent limit of rmss during this period ( mjd 55234 - 55289 ) .",
    "after mjd 55321 , where the xrt count rate drops below 10 cts / s , the light curves and pdss are heavily affected by background counts ( figure[fig : powspec_back ] ) and hence the rms values for these observations are unreliable and not plotted in figure[fig : xray_lc ] .",
    "the excess of low energy variability in the rising hard state is similar to the behaviour of the hard state variability in swiftj1753.5 - 0127 and gx339 - 4 as reported by @xcite . within the framework of their model , enhanced",
    "low energy variability ( at frequencies @xmath37hz ) is due to a contribution from the thermal emission of the accretion disk .",
    "the excess variability is attributed to intrinsic disk variability  due to accretion rate fluctuations  as opposed to reprocessing of the spectral power - law component of the emission .",
    "though a thermal component is not supported by the spectra of xtej1752 - 223 in the rising hard state , the excess variability we observe suggests that one might contribute to the flux at low energies .",
    "more detailed spectral fits using the methods introduced in @xcite are required to test this possibility .",
    "data , over a greater energy range , which better constrains column density and photon index may also be necessary .",
    "xtej1752 - 223 was observed by _ swift _ in a relatively low intensity , hard state from 2009 - 10 - 26 to 2009 - 11 - 03 ( mjd",
    "55131 - 55138 ) which was signified by hard power law energy spectra , and high levels ( @xmath38 per cent ) of rms variability in the x - ray light curve . xtej1752 - 223 then became constrained by the position of the sun and was unobservable until 2010 - 02 - 04 ( mjd 55234 ) by which time it had experienced a ten fold increase in the flux observed by xrt [ 0.3 - 10.0kev ] , which proceeded to decrease to the original levels over a period of 2 months .",
    "the spectra during this period clearly exhibited a strong thermal component and the variability and hardness ratios of the light curves had dropped significantly , consistent with the source being in a soft state until 2010 - 03 - 25 ( mjd 55280 ) .",
    "observations from 2010 - 03 - 28 ( mjd 55283 ) to 2010 - 05 - 12 ( mjd 55328 ) do not support a thermal component but do display a decreasing photon index along with increasing hardness and rms variability .",
    "this suggests a transitional state before reverting to the hard state , with a relatively constant photon index , in which the system is observed until the end of observations on 2010 - 06 - 05 ( mjd 55352 ) .",
    "the high energy hardness - intensity diagrams over two separate bands follow the canonical behavior associated with a black hole binary , further confirming the spectral states of the system during the outburst .",
    "our timing analysis shows that in the hard state there is significant variability below 10hz which is more pronounced at low energies , while during the soft state the level of variability is consistent with being minimal .",
    "we are able to confirm that the uvot source at the position of the proposed optical and near - infrared counterpart is associated with xtej1752 - 223 due to the observed low amplitude variability and , in the soft state and later , correlation with the x - ray emission as measured by xrt .",
    "however , we can not state that the optical flux is causally connected to the x - ray emission via reprocessing of the x - rays or through both originating from the accretion disk ; given the uncertainties of the spectral slope and the lack of phase lag information , we are unable to make a meaningful comparison to the predictions of the various models .",
    "the optical counterpart also displays hysteretical behaviour not normally observed in the optical bands ; for a given x - ray count rate , the magnitude in the rising hard state is significantly higher than that in the soft state .",
    "this is similar to the hysteretical behaviour observed in the nir for a number of transients where the additional hard state emission is attributed to optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet , which would be quenched in the soft state and weak at low x - ray luminosities . though this hysteresis is not normally observed in the optical bands , it is in good agreement with the synchrotron emitting jet making a significant contribution to the optical emission in the rising hard state .",
