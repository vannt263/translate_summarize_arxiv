    "after the initial discovery of a new state of matter in high - energy nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , the focus is now shifting to quantifying the properties of what is believed to constitute a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "basic quantities characterizing the medium are its thermal spectral functions and transport properties . in heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) ,",
    "the former are most directly studied in the electromagnetic ( vector ) channel via the thermal emission of lepton pairs ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the latter , however , are best studied using observables with small but controlled deviations from thermal equilibrium . thus , heavy quarks ( charm ( @xmath10 ) and bottom ( @xmath14 ) ) , whose thermal equilibration time is expected to be of the order of the qgp lifetime in hics , are a promising tool to quantify flavor transport , and eventually deduce general properties of the qgp as formed in these reactions  @xcite .",
    "the large masses of @xmath10 and @xmath14 quarks ( @xmath15 ) enable us to assess the modifications of their momentum spectra in hics via a diffusion process in an evolving background medium as formulated , e.g. , within a fokker - planck equation  @xcite ( typical early temperatures of the medium produced at rhic , @xmath16mev  @xcite , are well below @xmath17gev ) . a reliable determination of the heavy - quark ( hq ) transport coefficients in the qgp depends on several components .",
    "first and foremost these are microscopic calculations of the thermal hq relaxation rate in the qgp  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "second , the coefficients need to be implemented into a realistic bulk medium evolution ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "third , heavy - flavor ( hf ) interactions in evolution phases other than the qgp have to be evaluated , i.e. , in the so - called pre - equilibrium phase as well as in the hadronic phase .",
    "the former is of a relatively short duration , @xmath18fm/@xmath10 , and is sometimes mimicked by reducing the formation time of the qgp .",
    "the duration of the hadronic phase is substantially longer , @xmath19@xmath205 - 10fm/@xmath10 .",
    "its relevance for hf phenomenology is further augmented by the fact that the hadronic medium inherits the full momentum anisotropy from the qgp , believed to be close to the finally observed one .",
    "thus , even a rather weak coupling of hf hadrons to hadronic matter can lead to noticable contributions to their elliptic flow . furthermore , if the qgp realizes a minimum in its viscosity - to - entropy - density ratio , @xmath21 , close to the ( pseudo- ) critical temperature , @xmath22mev , a hadronic liquid close to @xmath12 should possess similar properties .",
    "this is usually referred to as a ",
    "quark - hadron duality \" , as suggested , e.g. , in calculations of thermal dilepton emission rates  @xcite .",
    "charm diffusion in hadronic matter has received little attention to date ( see ref .",

    "its potential relevance has been noted in ref .",

    "since the latter features many resonances at temperatures approaching @xmath12 , we not only utilize @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions but also scattering amplitudes off excited hadrons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 ) , as constructed in the literature using effective lagrangians and constrained by charm - resonance spectroscopy . in this sense",

    ", @xmath23 resonance scattering leads to a relaxation rate which is substantially smaller than what has been found in a recent calculation using heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory . yet , when extrapolating our full results to temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath12 , the relaxation rate reaches ca .",
    "0.1/fm , translating into a spatial diffusion coefficient of @xmath141 .",
    "this is comparable to non - perturbative @xmath11-matrix calculations of charm - quark relaxation in the qgp . on the one hand , this suggests a rather smooth evolution of charm transport through @xmath12 , i.e. , a kind of  duality \" of hadronic and quark - based calculations , reminiscent of what has been found for dilepton emission rates . on the other hand , it implies that quantitative calculations of @xmath0-meson spectra in heavy - ion collisions have to account for hadronic diffusion .",
    "this insight is reinforced once chemical freeze - out is implemented into the evolution of the hadronic phase ( via effective chemical potentials ) , with an estimated modification of @xmath0-meson observables of at least 20% .",
    "the apparent agreement of hadron- and quark - based approaches , when extrapolated to around @xmath12 , is encouraging , especially since the magnitude of the transport coefficient is compatible with the phenomenology of current heavy - flavor observables at rhic .",
    "our findings thus pave the way for an improved theoretical accuracy which will be needed to take advantage of upcoming precision measurements at rhic and lhc .    * note added . *",
