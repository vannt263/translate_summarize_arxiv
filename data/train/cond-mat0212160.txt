    "the explanation of these opposite behaviors is straightforward : in simple jm , if we take the thickness of the jellium shell at the edge as @xmath81 , then the volume of this shell contains a unit charge ( for singly - ionized clusters )    @xmath82    which gives    @xmath83    by eq .",

    "however , in the sjm , there exist two competing effects : on the one hand , as in the simple jm , because the jellium background is the same , increasing @xmath85 has the tendency to increase @xmath81 but , on the other hand , the sjm kohn - sham effective potential contains an extra term @xmath10 which is an increasing function of @xmath64 ( see table iv of ref .",

    "this term is negative for @xmath71 and hence deepens the effective potential ( compared to the jm ) which reduces the spill - out of the electrons , so that @xmath86 . on the other hand , for @xmath72 the extra term is positive which shallowen the effective potential ( compared to the jm ) which in turn increases the range of the kohn - sham orbitals from which the electron density is calculated .",
    "the result is that in the sjm , the overlap of the negative and positive charges increases ( the shell thickness decreases ) with increasing @xmath64 , so that @xmath87 .",

    "figure [ fig3](b ) shows the plots of @xmath61 for jm and sjm in scheme 2 . as we see , both of them are positive and have increasing behaviors .",
    "this means that the position of the centroid of the excess positive charge ( for the singly - ionized clusters ) lies outside the jellium edge which is incorrect because there exists no positive charge .",
