    "the functional renormalization group ( frg ) has been invented by wegner and houghton @xcite in the early days of the renormalization group ( rg ) as a mathematically exact formulation of the wilsonian rg . in the past decade",
    "this method has gained new attention . while there are several equivalent formulations of the frg involving different types of generating functionals , in many cases it is advantageous to formulate the frg in terms of the generating functional @xmath8 of the one - particle irreducible vertices , which can be obtained from the generating functional of the connected green functions via a legendre transformation @xcite .",
    "two different strategies of solving the formally exact frg equation for the functional @xmath8 have been developed : the first is based on the combination of the local potential approximation ( lpa ) with the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "this approach has been very successful to obtain accurate results for critical exponents @xcite and is convenient to describe the broken symmetry phase @xcite , because it is based on an expansion in terms of invariant densities , which automatically fulfill all symmetry requirements .",
    "the other strategy , which was pioneered by morris @xcite and has been preferentially used in the condensed matter community to study non - relativistic fermions  @xcite , is based on the expansion of @xmath8 in powers of the fields , leading to an infinite hierarchy of coupled integro - differential equations for the one - particle irreducible vertices .",
    "this approach has the advantage of providing information on the momentum- and frequency dependence of the vertices .",
    "however , there have been only two conceptually different attempts to extend the hierarchy of frg flow equations for the vertices arising from the field expansion into the broken symmetry phase .",
    "one possibility is to include a small symmetry - breaking component into the initial condition for the self - energy @xcite and to check whether this component evolves to a macroscopic value as the rg flow is integrated .",
    "a disadvantage of this scheme is that the order parameter field and its fluctuations do not explicitly appear and that one even has to invest some effort to recover simple mean - field results .",
    "another possibility to extend the frg flow equations for the irreducible vertices into the broken symmetry phase was proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is to augment the hierarchy of flow equations for the vertices by an additional equation for the flowing order parameter , which is obtained from the requirement that , at each stage of the rg flow , the vertex with one external leg vanishes identically .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show how this strategy works in practice . for simplicity we shall consider here",
    "a simple classical scalar @xmath9-theory , describing the critical behavior of the ising universality class ; generalizations of our method to quantum systems are straightforward .",
    "for example , this method has recently been used to study superconductivity in the attractive electron gas , where the flow equation for the order parameter is equivalent to a generalized bcs gap equation including fluctuation corrections @xcite .",
    "apart from showing how symmetry breaking can be taken into account in the field expansion , we present in this work two additional new results : on the one hand , we propose a simple truncation of the exact hierarchy of the flow equations for the irreducible vertices in the broken symmetry phase which yields the full momentum dependence of the self - energy @xmath1 , interpolating between the perturbative regime for large momenta @xmath10 and the critical regime for @xmath11 .",
    "different strategies to calculate the @xmath12-dependence of the self - energy ( and , more generally , the momentum dependence of the higher order vertices ) has recently been developed in @xcite and in @xcite . on the other hand , we present in this work an approximate calculation of the _ two - parameter _ scaling function @xmath13 describing the scaling of the self - energy of the system slightly below the critical temperature @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the order parameter correlation length , and @xmath6 is the ginzburg scale , which remains finite at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scaling function @xmath15 in the symmetric phase ( i.e. , for temperature @xmath16 ) has recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the ginzburg scale @xmath6 appears in the scaling of thermodynamic variables has been discussed in several recent works  @xcite , but apparently has been ignored in the older rg literature @xcite . for models with weak interactions , a universal regime , covering the complete crossover from the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point to the vicinity of the wilson - fisher - fixed point , exists which can be described completely within a two parameter scaling theory  @xcite . for the weakly interacting bose gas at criticality the one - parameter scaling function @xmath17 has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "however , the full implications of a finite scale @xmath6 at criticality and the resulting _ two - parameter _ scaling theory of the correlation function away from criticality has only recently been examined @xcite .",
    "the field expansion of the frg allows us to study the complete momentum dependence of correlation functions and is thus ideally suited to explore the extended universality near the critical temperature @xmath14 .",

    "the simplest choice is perhaps a sharp cutoff in momentum space , where the propagator is for @xmath45 given by  @xcite @xmath46 and the corresponding single - scale propagator is @xmath47 while in the symmetric phase the sharp cutoff is very convenient @xcite , it leads to technical complications in the broken symmetry phase ( see the discussion after ( [ eq : etadotgamma ] ) below ) .",
    "these can be avoided if we use a smooth cutoff procedure , which we implement via an additive regulator @xmath48 in the inverse propagator @xcite .",

    "the basic idea is to require that the vertex with one external leg vanishes identically for all values of the flow parameter , which yields an additional flow equation for the order parameter .",
    "our method differs from that employed in @xcite , which do not explicitly include a flow equation for the order parameter .",
    "2 .   guided by the lpa",
    ", we have proposed a simple truncation of the frg flow equation for the momentum dependent self - energy @xmath1 , which yields a reasonable interpolation between the perturbative regime for large momenta and the critical regime for @xmath217 .",
    "we have also pointed out that a sharp @xmath218-function cutoff ( which is still very popular in the condensed matter community ) is not suitable to analyze the broken symmetry phase , because it generates a non - analytic term proportional to @xmath219 in the two - point vertex for momentum scales below the rg cutoff @xmath28 3 .   using the above truncation",
    ", we have calculated the two - parameter scaling function @xmath220 describing the scaling of the self - energy in the broken symmetry phase slightly below the critical temperature .",
    "similar to the case @xmath221 discussed in @xcite , the scaling function depends on two parameters , involving the correlation length @xmath5 and the ginzburg scale @xmath6 .",
    "the latter remains finite at the critical point and measures the size of the critical region .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the method described here to study spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum mechanical many - body systems .",
    "for example , our approach can be used to obtain fluctuation corrections to the bcs gap equation in the attractive fermi gas @xcite . note that beyond the bcs approximation the superconducting order parameter should be distinguished from the off - diagonal self - energy associated with the single - particle green function , so that it is important to introduce both quantities into the frg as independent parameters .",
    "we are currently using our method to study the interacting bose gas  @xcite , where a truncation similar to the one discussed here yields corrections to the bogoliubov mean - field approximation for the diagonal and off - diagonal self - energies which are consistent with the hugenholtz - pines theorem @xcite .",
    "we thank j. m. pawlowski for useful discussions and acknowledge the collaboration with f. schtz at initial stages of this work .",
    "using the litim cutoff @xcite given in ( [ eq : rlitim ] ) we can rewrite the function @xmath222 defined in ( [ eq : idef ] ) as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is defined in ( [ eq : rpoint2 ] ) . in @xmath124 the integration in ( [ eq : gammapoint ] ) can be performed exactly .",
