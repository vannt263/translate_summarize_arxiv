    "strong decays constitute a rather poorly understood area of hadron physics .",
    "a phenomenological model of hadron decays was developed in the 1970s by leyaouanc _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which assumes as earlier suggested by micu @xcite that during a hadron decay a @xmath0 pair is produced from the vacuum with vacuum quantum numbers , @xmath10 . since this corresponds to a p0 @xmath0 state ,",
    "this is now generally referred to as the p0 decay model .",
    "the p0 pair production hamiltonian for the decay of a @xmath0 meson a to mesons b + c is usually written in a rather complicated form with explicit wavefunctions @xcite , which in the conventions of geiger and swanson @xcite ( to within an irrelevant overall phase ) is @xmath11 @xmath12 for all quark and antiquark masses equal .",
    "the strength @xmath13 of the decay interaction is regarded as a free constant and is fitted to data @xcite .",
    "studies of hadron decays using this model have been concerned almost exclusively with numerical predictions , and have not led to any fundamental modifications .",
    "recent studies have considered changes in the spatial dependence of the pair production amplitude as a function of quark coordinates @xcite but the fundamental decay mechanism is usually not addressed ; this is widely believed to be a nonperturbative process , involving ",
    "flux tube breaking \" .",
    "there have been some studies of the decay mechanism which consider an alternative phenomenological model in which the @xmath0 pair is produced with @xmath3s@xmath7 quantum numbers @xcite ; this possibility however is rejected by experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we first review the phenomenological p0 model and its predictions and develop a diagrammatic representation , following which we will test candidate qcd ( quark - gluon ) decay mechanisms for these strong decays .    an equivalent formulation of the @xmath3p@xmath6 model regards the decays as due to an interaction hamiltonian involving dirac quark fields , @xmath14 which in the nonrelativistic limit gives matrix elements identical to ( 1 ) with the identification @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quark mass of the produced pair .",
    "the operator @xmath17 leads to the decay @xmath18 through the @xmath19 term .",
    "this model makes no reference to color , which if included would simply change the definition of the interaction strength @xmath13 ; since @xmath13 is fitted to data , this would not change the predictions for meson decays .",
    "ad hoc _ feature of the @xmath3p@xmath6 model is to allow only diagrams in which the @xmath0 pair separate into different final hadrons .",
    "this was originally motivated by experiment ( specifically the weakness of @xmath20 ) ; in the qcd - based current - current decay models that we shall discuss subsequently the absence of these hairpin diagrams is a natural consequence of the production of the @xmath0 pair in a color octet state .    to determine a decay rate we evaluate the matrix element of the decay hamiltonian , which is of the form @xmath21",
    "this @xmath22 decay amplitude can be combined with relativistic phase space to give the differential decay rate , which is @xmath23 where we have set @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "an equivalent result is quoted by geiger and swanson @xcite as the  actual phase space \" case of their equation ( 20 ) .",
    "we shall usually quote results for the amplitude @xmath26 , defined by @xmath27 for @xmath28 this @xmath29 is the coefficient of @xmath30 in @xmath22 , and in general is the amplitude @xmath31 in the @xmath32 final state .",
    "we have developed a diagrammatic technique for evaluating the @xmath22 matrix element , which is discussed in detail for @xmath33 in the p0 model in appendix a. for @xmath0 meson decays there are two independent diagrams , shown below .    @xmath34 figure  1 .",
    "the two independent @xmath0 meson decay diagrams in the @xmath3p@xmath6 decay model .",
    "since the p0 model involves a free phenomenological interaction strength @xmath13 , comparison with experiment requires a fit to several rates ( to determine both @xmath13 and the wavefunction parameters ) or a determination of amplitude ratios in decays with more than one partial wave , in which @xmath13 cancels .",
    "here we illustrate both applications ; first we will evaluate the dominant two - body decay rates of light nonstrange mesons with l@xmath35 and l@xmath36 , and subsequently we will evaluate d / s ratios in the decays @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "an @xmath29 decay amplitude in the p0 model with sho wavefunctions is proportional to a polynomial @xmath40 in @xmath41 times an exponential , @xmath42 for the cases considered here these polynomials are @xmath43    for physical decays there is an additional multiplicative flavor factor , as discussed in appendix  a. in figure 2 we show these decay rates for physical mesons for a wide range of wavefunction length scales @xmath44 ( defined in app.a ) .    @xmath45 figure  2 .",
    "representative light @xmath0 meson decay rates in the @xmath3p@xmath6 decay model .",
    "parameters @xmath44 variable , @xmath46 .",
    "we set @xmath46 in the figure because this is near the optimum fitted value .",
    "a value of @xmath47-@xmath48 gev evidently gives a reasonably accurate description of the relative decay rates ( see also table 1 below ) .",
    "many recent quark model studies of meson @xcite and baryon @xcite decays use a value of @xmath49 gev , at the upper end of this range .",
    "a simple estimate of the optimum @xmath44 for these sho wavefunctions follows if we require maximum overlap with coulomb plus linear wavefunctions @xmath50 . with typical quark model parameters of @xmath51 , @xmath52 gev@xmath53 and @xmath54 gev ,",
    "the overlap @xmath55 is maximum at @xmath56  gev for l@xmath35 ( @xmath57 overlap ) and @xmath58  gev for l@xmath36 ( @xmath59 overlap ) .",
    "curiously , this @xmath44 would imply a narrow @xmath60 in the @xmath61 decay model .",
    "comparison with figure 2 shows that these @xmath44 estimates are similar to the values required to describe decays , although there is some evidence of a systematic discrepancy , @xmath62 .",

    "all but @xmath75 are nonstrange systems , which we chose to avoid parameter differences due to strange quarks .",
    "the @xmath87 is included because we found that it is quite important to include a light p0 @xmath0 decay , since the rate @xmath88p@xmath89s@xmath90s@xmath6 is quite sensitive to @xmath44 , and the @xmath87 is the only well established p0 resonance . on fitting these widths using eqs.(6 - 15 ) ( minimizing @xmath91 ) , we find the parameters @xmath92 @xmath93 clearly the most important discrepancy in the table is @xmath33 , which is well known to be a problem relative to the decays of p - wave @xmath0 mesons in this model .",
    "the @xmath87 width is also rather smaller than experiment .",

    "for example , at @xmath95 gev we find an @xmath96 broader than the @xmath97 and @xmath98 and a @xmath87 width near zero .",
    "conversely , if we increase @xmath44 to @xmath99 gev we find quite small partial widths for @xmath33 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 relative to the @xmath102 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , on average only 0.31 of @xmath1 ; experimentally the ratio is 0.89 .",
    "the interesting question of the width of an @xmath60 @xmath0 state is unfortunately problematical in the @xmath3p@xmath6 model , since like @xmath75 this rate has a node near @xmath103  gev , and increases rapidly with @xmath44 above the node . for our fitted parameters",
    "we find @xmath104  mev , but comparison of the predicted and observed @xmath87 widths suggests that the actual @xmath60 partial width to @xmath105 is @xmath106  mev . we shall subsequently show that the transition @xmath3p@xmath107s@xmath108s@xmath109 has an unusually large oge decay amplitude , which may explain why the light scalars @xmath60 and k@xmath110 are broad states despite the node in the p0 decay amplitude .",
    "sensitive tests of decay models are possible in decays with more than one partial wave , because one can measure the relative phases as well as the magnitudes of the decay amplitudes in these processes .",
    "multiamplitude decays require at least one final meson to have nonzero spin . for the decays considered here the relevant final states are @xmath111 and @xmath112 ;",
    "other possibilities are excluded by phase space .",
    "these final states have s@xmath113 , so of all the light l@xmath35 and l@xmath36 mesons only the @xmath114 mesons have more than one partial wave ; these decay to both s- and d - wave vector + pseudoscalar final states . on increasing l@xmath115",
    "we next encounter multiamplitude decays in the d states , for example in @xmath116 ( p , f ) @xcite and @xmath117 ( s , d , g ) .    here",
    "we will calculate the d / s amplitude ratios in the decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "d / s for @xmath118 , which has not been measured , is theoretically equal to @xmath1 to within small phase space differences , since these are both @xmath119p@xmath120s@xmath121s@xmath6 decays .",
    "the @xmath102 is clearly the most attractive of these experimentally , due to the smaller widths of the @xmath102 and @xmath122 .",
    "we assume an initial polarization @xmath123j@xmath124 and determine the @xmath22 matrix element to a final state with a specific @xmath122 polarization that allows both l values ; we choose @xmath125s@xmath124 . using the diagrammatic techniques of appendix",
    "a , we find that the two diagrams @xmath126 and @xmath127 give equal contributions , and the total @xmath22 is @xmath128 this matrix element determines the relative s and d amplitudes in the @xmath129 final state ; since the j@xmath113 @xmath130 state is of the form @xmath131 it follows from a clebsch - gordon decomposition that the amplitude to find a @xmath132-polarized @xmath122 in an @xmath112 pair with decay direction @xmath133 must be @xmath134 we can therefore read the @xmath135 ratio directly from the @xmath22 matrix element ( 18 ) , which gives @xmath136 this is equivalent to the result ( 4.11,12 ) of leyaouanc _ et al . _",
    "@xcite when one specializes their result to @xmath137 , which is our @xmath138 .",
    "this d / s ratio is also implicit in ( 14,15 ) . since the strength of the pair production amplitude and some of the momentum dependence in the overlap integrals cancel out in this ratio , there is less systematic uncertainty than in the decay rates .",
    "proceeding similarly for @xmath2 we find @xmath139 the _ ratio _ of d / s ratios in these decays is especially interesting in the p0 model because all the dependence on the spatial wavefunctions cancels .",
    "we then find @xmath140 experimentally these ratios are @xmath141 and from a recent argus measurement @xcite @xmath142 so the ratio is @xmath143 theory and experiment for these d / s ratios are compared in figure 3 ; a best fit to these d / s ratios alone gives @xmath144 gev , for which ( d / s)@xmath145 and ( d / s)@xmath146 .",
    "( the small theoretical departure from @xmath147 is due to phase space differences . )",
    "the experimental ratio ( 26 ) is approximately consistent with the p0 prediction but shows the need for a more accurate experimental determination , especially in @xmath2 .",
    "this important d / s ratio has only been measured in one experiment ; an improved value would allow an interesting test of the p0 model , since the oge decay mechanism predicts a departure of the ratio ( 23 ) from @xmath147 ; we will discuss this in the next section .    in summary , the decay rates of light l@xmath35 and l@xmath36 mesons ( figure",

    "in this paper we have discussed the current theoretical understanding of open flavor strong decays and proposed new `` microscopic '' quark and gluon mechanisms for these decays .",
    "we began by reviewing the p0 decay model and introduced a diagrammatic representation for its decay amplitudes .",
    "we then carried out detailed calculations of the decay amplitudes for a representative set of light meson decays , first in the p0 model and then in microscopic decay models , which assume that the @xmath0 pair is created by an oge mechanism or by nonperturbative pair production from the scalar confining potential .",
    "these results were derived analytically using well established light quark interactions and sho wavefunctions .",
    "we find that with conventional quark model parameters the light @xmath0 open - flavor meson decays are usually dominated by @xmath0 pair production from the scalar confining potential .",
    "we refer to this as the sks ( scalar - kernel - scalar ) decay model .",
    "this explains the success of the phenomenological p0 decay model , since the @xmath247 scalar current produces pairs in a p0 state , which is assumed _ a priori _ in the p0 model .",
    "the dimensionless pair production strength @xmath13 is not determined theoretically in the p0 model , and is treated as a free parameter .",

    "although there are differences in detail between the p0 and sks models due to the different overlap integrals , we find that the numerical predictions for relative decay rates and amplitudes in the decays we have considered are remarkably similar .",
    "in addition to explaining the success of the p0 model , our description of decays also accounts naturally for the absence of `` hairpin '' diagrams ; since the microscopic pair production interactions produce @xmath0 pairs in color - octet states , hairpin diagrams are forbidden without additional interactions . in the usual @xmath3p@xmath6-like decay models",
    "one assumes pair production of a @xmath0 color singlet , and hairpin diagrams are simply ignored without theoretical justification .",
    "other tests of the color state of @xmath0 pair production in decays would be useful to discriminate between the p0 model and our color - octet description .",
    "an unsolved problem is that the overall scale of the amplitudes in the full sks+oge microscopic decay model is too large by about a factor of two , given conventional quark model parameters .",
    "this discrepancy of scale may be due to our neglect of relativistic effects such as the @xmath249 external line normalizations in ( 38 ) .",
    "although we have shown that oge @xmath0 pair production is usually dominated by the nonperturbative sks decay amplitudes , we do find numerically important oge contributions in some channels , notably @xmath3p@xmath250s@xmath6+@xmath8s@xmath6 . in that case",
    "oge pair production actually dominates the nonperturbative sks amplitude , and insures broad @xmath60 and k@xmath110 @xmath0 resonances .",
    "oge pair production also makes characteristic contributions to some observables such as the d / s amplitude ratios in @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". it may be possible to identify oge contributions in these and similar multiamplitude decays .",
    "in future work it would be interesting to apply these microscopic decay calculations to charmonium ( where the transverse oge contribution should be much smaller ) and to strong decays of light baryons , for which new data is expected from the cebaf experimental program .",
    "the simple exercise of extending these light meson calculations to higher - l@xmath115 initial mesons would also be very useful , as it appears likely that large departures from p0 and sks model predictions due to oge contributions could be found among the many decay channels available to these states .",
