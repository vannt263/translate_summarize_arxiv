    "aside from being the major constituent of the outer crust of the earth , oxides are of considerable interest for their wide applications in various technological fields such as electrochemistry , catalysis or microelectronics.@xcite .",
    "they present very diverse electronic ground states which range from superconducting , metallic , semi  conducting ( intrinsic , charge density or spin density  like ) to insulating .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , a proper description of their electronic properties is still an active research subject . on the one hand ,",
    "several transition metal oxides require an inclusion of many - body effects beyond the available effective one - electron approaches , such as the density functional theory ( dft ) or the _ ab initio _ hartree - fock ( hf ) method . on the other hand , even for insulating charge transfer oxides , such as mgo and sro , whose electronic ground state is well accounted for in a one - electron picture , the calculation of quasiparticle ( qp ) energies within the dft or the hf method gives rather poor results .",
    "indeed , one has to face the so - called energy band gap problem @xcite . indeed , when using the kohn - sham eigenvalues of the highest occupied and the lowest empty states , the resulting gap usually underestimates the experimental data .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding difference between the hf eigenvalues overestimates the gap severely .",
    "alternative ways to calculate the band gap in infinite systems have been found , in the framework of hf or dft .",
    "one of them is based on total energy differences between ground and charge transfer states @xcite .",
    "the other one relies on the value of the gap found in the one electron spectrum of the ionized or hole - doped system @xcite . however , such methods are unable to provide the full qp spectrum .    in the last decade , due to the implementation of angular resolved photoemission experiments able to cope with charging effects on insulating oxides , detailed qp spectra of mgo@xcite , srtio@xmath0@xcite or tio@xmath2@xcite among other oxides ,",
    "have become available .",
    "the experimental achievements demand systematic improvements in the theoretical description of the electronic excitations of simple oxides .    in semiconducting and ionic crystalline compounds , corrections to the dft eigenvalues , as obtained from the kohn - sham equations ,",
    "may be estimated by first - order many - body perturbation theory @xcite , with respect to the difference between the exchange - correlation ( xc ) self - energy and the corresponding xc potential of the dft , for which various approximations are available . within the same approach ,",
    "the self - energy operator is treated in the gw approximation proposed by hedin@xcite .",
    "such calculations have been carried out with success in several semiconducting and insulating crystals @xcite , permitting the prediction of the quasiparticle energies and the calculation of optical properties of real solids .",
    "one of the crucial points in such calculations is the evaluation of the self - energy operator , which is numerically very expensive , because of the required knowledge of the full inverse dielectric matrix of the system under study .",
    "this is a bottleneck for the application of the method to systems with a large number of atoms in the unit cell , such as surfaces @xcite and defective or low  symmetry solids . in order to reduce the remarkable numerical effort and",
    "be able to predict electronic excited states in a wider range of real systems , one may use efficient gw methods , in which a model dielectric function is used to mimic the screening properties of the system under study .",
    "pioneering work in this direction has been performed by bechstedt and del sole in a tight - binding scheme @xcite and by gygi and baldereschi @xcite within the dft in the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange and correlation energy .",
    "the key of their work relies _ ( i ) _ on the use of a model dielectric function , which mimics the main screening properties of semiconductors , and _",
    "( ii ) _ on an approximated self - energy operator in which both local fields and dynamical screening  giving rise to opposite contributions to band gaps are neglected .",
    "@xcite for a large family of semiconductors , the band gaps obtained through these simplified methods show good accordance both with experiments and full gw results , in which the screening properties of the system are calculated from first principles .",
    "more recently , an efficient gw method that approximately includes dynamical - screening and local field effects , without increasing the computational effort , has been formulated @xcite and proved to reproduce quasiparticle energies and band gaps for either bulk zincblende solids ( ranging from si , gaas , alas to the more ionic znse)@xcite or non cubic systems ( bn@xcite , sic polytypes@xcite ) satisfactorily .",
    "the method is based on a linear expansion of the dynamical contribution to the exchange - correlation self - energy , on the use of a model dielectric function , and on a local ansatz for the treatment of the intrinsically non local screened interaction .",
    "depending on the system , the speedup of the calculation may result of two order of magnitude with respect to corresponding full gw ones .",
    "moreover , this kind of gw calculations is feasible on a standard workstation .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the ground state properties of cubic magnesium oxide , strontium oxide and strontium titanate , in the dft - lda scheme , as well as their quasiparticle band structures within the efficient gw scheme . on one hand , no previous gw calculation of sro or srtio@xmath0 exists , to our knowledge . on the other hand , these charge transfer oxides are characterized by different fundamental gaps , ranging from @xmath3 3 ev ( srtio@xmath0 ) to @xmath3 7.7 ev ( mgo ) , as given by experimental data .",
    "their bandstructures may substantially differ from those of the semiconductors cited above , due to the presence of strongly localized electronic states .",
    "thus , such a study may also represent a test for the approximate gw scheme , originally proposed for small - gap semiconductors , to show its capabilities relatively to a different class of physical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework is depicted in section ii and it is followed , in section iii , by a description of the computational ingredients used for the description of structural and electronic properties of mgo , sro and srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the results obtained for these systems are presented separately in sections iv , v and vi , respectively .",
    "finally , in section vii we present our conclusions and the perspectives opened by our work .",
    "the energy @xmath4 of a quasiparticle in a band @xmath5 at a given @xmath6 point in the brillouin zone can be obtained through the equation : @xcite @xmath7 \\phi_{n \\vec k}(\\vec r ) \\ ,   +   \\ , \\int d^3\\vec r^\\prime \\",

    "it contains the exchange and correlation effects and is state ( @xmath14 ) dependent .",
    "one can compare the above equation to that of kohn and sham @xcite : @xmath15 \\psi_{n",

    "@xmath18 is usually considered as a first approximation to the quasiparticle energy .",
    "the failure of this scheme for evaluating transition energies @xmath19 between different quasiparticle states in solids has been evidenced by many authors @xcite .",
    "one can correct the dft eigenvalues @xmath20 , in a first - order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath21 , and estimate the qp energies as : @xmath22 the evaluation of @xmath23 is in general a very difficult task .",
    "a possible approximation is the gw one , @xcite in which a perturbation expansion for the self - energy can be constructed and stopped at the first order : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the one - particle green function , @xmath26 is the screened coulomb interaction and @xmath27 .",
    "following bechstedt and coworkers,@xcite the real part of the self - energy operator ( which is relevant for the corrections to the qp bandstructure ) may be separated in a dynamic and a static contribution , and written as : @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the static screened  exchange ( sex ) and the coulomb",
    " hole ( coh ) terms , respectively , and @xmath31 the energy dependent contribution .",
    "although the previous equation is purely formal , it is the starting point of simplified gw schemes , since one can work out approximated expressions for each contribution separately .",
    "the most expensive step towards the evaluation of gw corrections to @xmath18 is the calculation of the energy - dependent screened interaction @xmath32 .",
    "although many improvements have been proposed for an efficient calculation of the dielectric response function from first principles , @xcite still this stage is both computer time and memory very demanding when a large basis set is used for the description of the electronic structure . in particular",
    ", this is the case of oxides in a plane - wave pseudopotential approach . on the other hand , the improvement of dft  lda band structures obtained by using schemes originally formulated on phenomenological basis , such as the scissor operator or the slater s @xmath33 potential",
    ", @xcite showed that the essential physics can be described through the use of effective or state - dependent potentials . from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", one can work out a model for the screening properties of the system , and look to what extent the computed qp spectra account for the observed experimental values .",
    "possibly , the model should also be simple enough to be generalized to a large number of different systems .",
    "following previous studies , @xcite we use a model dielectric function to estimate both the static and the dynamical contributions to the self - energy ( eq.[eq:5 ] ) , since it is the key ingredient entering the efficient gw approximations .      for the diagonal part of the screening function , we use an analytical model originally proposed by bechstedt and del sole",

    "this expression mimics the free electron gas behavior at high @xmath38 . at @xmath39 , eq.[eq:6 ] gives the value of the optical dielectric constant @xmath40 of the oxide .",
    "moreover we use a local _ ansatz _ for the static coulomb screened interaction , analogously to that of hybertsen and louie @xcite : @xmath41   \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the screened coulomb interaction of a virtual homogeneous system characterized by a finite optical dielectric constant .",
    "@xcite quasiparticle energies determined from the above _ ansatz _ result in good accordance with full gw calculated ones.@xcite it permits , together with eq.(6 ) , to obtain a simple analytical expression for the static part of the coulomb hole self energy @xmath30 .",
    "the explicit formula has been given elsewhere .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of @xmath29 in eq.[eq:5 ] , the fourier transform of @xmath43 is needed , namely @xmath44 . in order to reduce sharply the time needed to compute this term",
    ", we proceed in two steps .",
    "firstly , we retain only the diagonal terms in the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "secondly , we account for local field effects ( _ i.e. _ non diagonal terms with @xmath45 in @xmath46 ) by using suitable state - dependent densities to compute @xmath35 and @xmath36 . given a state @xmath47",
    ", we define the effective electron density @xmath48 , which determines the typical screening lengths @xmath49 and @xmath50 , relevant for the estimation of @xmath51 ( eq.[eq:3 ] ) as the expectation value of the ground state electronic density @xmath52 on the actual state : @xmath53 since the relevant screening lengths @xmath50 and @xmath49 are increasing functions of @xmath54 , the latter is intended to give an approximate description of the local fields in @xmath55 through an enhanced screening for the electronic states which contribute effectively to the total electron density . in the oxides considered here ,",
    "the effective densities @xmath54 range from few tenths of the mean valence electron density @xmath56 for conduction states up to 45 @xmath37 for deep valence states . as a consequence ,",
    "the lengths @xmath50 and @xmath49 are shorter for the screening of valence band states than for conduction band states .",
    "this difference is enhanced with respect to more covalent semiconductors , such as si and gaas @xcite , in which the valence electron distribution is more delocalized and less dissimilar from that of the conduction states than in oxides such as mgo .",
    "this approximate scheme for treating local field effects was analyzed in detail and its reliability was shown through a comparison with full gw calculations , in the case of both small and wide  gap semiconductors @xcite . in ref .",
