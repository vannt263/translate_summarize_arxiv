    "<S> cms will use dijets to search for physics beyond the standard model during early lhc running . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive jet cross section as a function of jet transverse momentum , with 10 pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity , is sensitive to contact interactions beyond the reach of the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the dijet mass distribution will be used to search for dijet resonances coming from new particles , for example an excited quark . </S>",
    "<S> additional sensitivity to the existence of contact interactions or dijet resonances can be obtained by comparing dijet rates in two distinct pseudorapidity regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the large hadron collider at cern will produce many events with two energetic jets resulting from proton - proton collisions at @xmath1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> these dijet events result from parton scattering , produced by the strong interaction of quarks ( @xmath2 ) and gluons ( @xmath3 ) inside the protons . </S>",
    "<S> this paper discusses plans to use dijets in the search for two signals of new physics : contact interactions and resonances decaying into dijets . </S>",
    "<S> two models of quark compositeness have been considered for this generic search . </S>",
    "<S> the first model is a contact interaction  @xcite among left - handed quarks at an energy scale @xmath4 in the process @xmath5 , modeled with the effective lagrangian @xmath6 with @xmath7 chosen for the sign . </S>",
    "<S> the second is a model of an excited quark ( @xmath2 * )  @xcite in the process @xmath8 , detectable as a dijet resonance . </S>",
    "<S> all processes presented here have been simulated using pythia version 6.4  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment can be found elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cms coordinate system has the origin at the center of the detector , @xmath9-axis points along the beam direction toward the west , with the transverse plane perpendicular to the beam . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath10 to be the azimuthal angle , @xmath11 to be the polar angle and the pseudorapidity as @xmath12)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the central feature of the cms apparatus is a superconducting solenoid , of 6 m internal diameter . within the field volume </S>",
    "<S> are the silicon pixel and strip tracker , and the barrel and endcap calorimeters ( @xmath13 ) : a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and a brass - scintillator hadronic calorimeter ( hcal ) . outside the field volume , in the forward region </S>",
    "<S> , there is an iron - quartz fiber hadronic calorimeter ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hcal and ecal cells are grouped into towers , projecting radially outward from the origin , for triggering purposes and to facilitate the jet reconstruction . in the region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 these projective calorimeter towers have segmentation @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 and @xmath10 width progressively increases at higher values of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy in the hcal and ecal within each projective tower is summed to find the calorimeter tower energy . </S>",
    "<S> towers with @xmath18 contain only cells from the barrel calorimeters , towers in the transition region @xmath19 contain a mixture of barrel and endcap cells , and towers in the region @xmath20 contain only cells from the endcap calorimeters .    </S>",
    "<S> jets are reconstructed using both the iterative and midpoint cone algorithms  @xcite , with indistinguishable results for this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> below we will discuss three types of jets : reconstructed , corrected and generated . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed jet energy , @xmath21 , is defined as the scalar sum of the calorimeter tower energies inside a cone of radius @xmath22 , centered on the jet axis . </S>",
    "<S> the jet momentum , @xmath23 , is the corresponding vector sum : @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the unit vector pointing from the origin to the energy deposition @xmath26 inside the cone . the jet transverse momentum , @xmath27 , is the component of @xmath23 in the transverse plane . the @xmath21 and @xmath23 of a reconstructed jet </S>",
    "<S> are then corrected for the non - linear response of the calorimeter to a generated jet . </S>",
    "<S> generated jets come from applying the same jet algorithm to the lorentz vectors of stable generated particles before detector simulation . on average , the @xmath27 of a corrected jet is equal to the @xmath27 of the corresponding generated jet . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections estimated from a geant  @xcite simulation of the cms detector increase the average jet @xmath27 by roughly 50% ( 10% ) for 70 gev ( 3 tev ) jets in the region @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the applied corrections depend on jet @xmath17 as well as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the jet measurements presented here are within the region @xmath18 , where the sensitivity to new physics is expected to be the highest , and where the reconstructed jet response variations as a function of @xmath17 are both moderate and smooth . </S>",
    "<S> further details on jet reconstruction and jet energy corrections can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dijet system is composed of the two jets with the highest @xmath27 in an event ( leading jets ) , and the dijet mass is given by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated dijet mass resolution varies from 9% at a dijet mass of 0.7 tev to 4.5% at 5 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> cms will record events that pass a first level trigger followed by a high level trigger . </S>",
    "<S> for an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath29 @xmath30s@xmath0 , we consider three event samples collected by requiring at least one jet in the high level trigger with corrected transverse energy above 60 , 120 and 250 gev , prescaled by factors of 2000 , 40 and 1 , respectively . for an integrated luminosity of 100  pb@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the three event samples will effectively correspond to 0.05 , 2.5 , and 100  pb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the first event sample will be used to measure the trigger efficiency of the second sample . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third event samples will be used to study dijets of mass above 330 and 670 gev , respectively , for which the trigger efficiencies are expected to be higher than 99%  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> backgrounds from cosmic rays , beam halo , and detector noise are expected to occasionally produce events with large or unbalanced energy depositions . </S>",
    "<S> they will be removed by requiring and @xmath31 tev , where ( @xmath32 ) is the magnitude of the vector ( scalar ) sum of the transverse energies measured by all calorimeter towers in the event . </S>",
    "<S> this cut is estimated to be more than 99% efficient for both qcd jet events and the signals of new physics considered . in the high @xmath27 region relevant for this search , jet reconstruction is fully efficient .    </S>",
    "<S> cms plans to search for contact interactions using the jet @xmath27 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] shows simulations of the inclusive jet differential cross section as a function of @xmath27 , for jets with @xmath33 . considering first the qcd processes , </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed and corrected quantities are compared with the qcd prediction for generated jets . </S>",
    "<S> after corrections , the reconstructed and generated distributions agree . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the corrected jet cross section to the generated jet cross section varies between 1.2 at @xmath27 = 100 gev and 1.05 at @xmath27 = 500 gev , remaining roughly constant for higher @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of this ratio from 1 is attributed to the smearing effect of the jet @xmath27 resolution on the steeply falling spectrum . the measured spectrum in data </S>",
    "<S> could be further corrected for resolution smearing , and this ratio from simulation is an estimate of the size of that correction . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement uncertainties are predominantly systematic . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the effect on the jet rate of a 10% uncertainty in the jet energy correction . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] also shows the effect of this uncertainty on a lowest order qcd calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this level of jet energy uncertainty could be expected in early running , for an integrated luminosity around 10 pb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental uncertainty is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the uncertainties from parton distributions , as estimated using cteq6.1 fits  @xcite and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] show that the effect of new physics from a contact interaction with scale @xmath34 tev is convincingly above what could be expected for measurement uncertainties with only 10 pb@xmath0 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> a tevatron search has excluded contact interactions with scales @xmath35 below 2.7  tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the lowest order calculations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] are the same as the simulation results in the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> cms plans to search for narrow dijet resonances using the dijet mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows the differential cross section versus dijet mass , where both leading jets have @xmath33 , and the mass bins have a width roughly equal to the dijet mass resolution . </S>",
    "<S> considering first the qcd processes , the cross section for corrected jets agrees with the qcd prediction from generated jets . to determine the background shape either the monte carlo prediction or a parameterized fit to the data can be used . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows a simulation of narrow dijet resonances with a @xmath2 * production cross section . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> * masses of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 tev the cross sections for jet @xmath33 are @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 pb , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is compared to the statistical uncertainties in the qcd prediction , including trigger prescaling . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison shows that with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath0 a @xmath2 * dijet resonance with a mass of 2 tev would produce a convincing signal above the statistical uncertainties from the qcd background . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , a tevatron search has excluded @xmath2 * dijet resonances with mass , m , below @xmath42 tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heaviest dijet resonances that cms can discover ( at five standard deviations ) with 100  pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity , using this search technique and including the expected systematic uncertainties  @xcite , are : 2.5  tev for @xmath2 * , 2.2  tev for axigluons  @xcite or colorons  @xcite , 2.0  tev for @xmath43 diquarks  @xcite , and 1.5  tev for color octet technirhos  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies of the jet @xmath17 cut have concluded that the optimal sensitivity to new physics is achieved with @xmath18 for a 2 tev spin 1 dijet resonance decaying to @xmath44  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cms plans to search for both contact interactions and dijet resonances using the dijet ratio , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of events with both jets in the specified @xmath47 region . </S>",
    "<S> the dijet ratio is sensitive to the dijet angular distribution . for the qcd processes , </S>",
    "<S> the dijet ratio is the same for corrected jets and generated jets , and is constant at @xmath48 for dijet masses up to 6 tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] shows the dijet ratio from contact interactions and dijet resonances , compared to the expected statistical uncertainty on the qcd processes , for 100 pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity , including trigger prescaling . </S>",
    "<S> the signal from a contact interaction with scale @xmath49 tev rises well above the qcd statistical errors at high dijet mass . </S>",
    "<S> systematic uncertainties in the dijet ratio are expected to be small , since they predominantly cancel in the ratio as previously reported  @xcite . using the dijet ratio </S>",
    "<S> , cms can discover a contact interaction at scale @xmath50 , 7 and 10 tev with integrated luminosities of 10 , 100 , and 1000 pb@xmath0 , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the signal from a 2 tev spin 1/2 @xmath2 * produces a convincing peak in the dijet ratio , because it has a significant rate and a relatively isotropic angular distribution compared to the qcd @xmath51-channel processes . </S>",
    "<S> fixing the cross section of the 2 tev dijet resonance for @xmath18 at @xmath52 pb ( from the @xmath2 * model ) , the dijet ratio in the presence of qcd background increases by approximately 6% when considering a spin 2 resonance decaying to both @xmath44 and @xmath53 ( such as a randall - sundrum graviton  @xcite ) , and the dijet ratio decreases by approximately 4% when considering a spin 1 resonance decaying to @xmath44 ( such as a z@xmath54 , axigluon , or coloron )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the sensitivity to a 2 tev dijet resonance depends only weakly on the spin of the resonance . to measure the spin , we need both the dijet ratio and an independent measurement of the cross section of the resonance , for example , from the dijet mass differential cross section </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , with sufficient luminosity , this simple measure of the dijet angular distribution , or a more complete evaluation of the angular distribution , can be used to see these small variations and infer the spin of an observed dijet resonance .    in conclusion , cms plans to use measurements of rate as a function of jet @xmath27 and dijet mass , as well as a ratio of dijet rates in different @xmath17 regions , to search for new physics in the data sample collected during early lhc running . with integrated luminosity samples in the range 10100 pb@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , cms will be sensitive to contact interactions and dijet resonances beyond those currently excluded by the tevatron .    </S>",
