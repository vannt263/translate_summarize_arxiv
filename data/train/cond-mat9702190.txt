    "the use of a substitutional impurity such as zn for cu within the copper oxide planes of the high @xmath0 materials@xcite is considerably helpful for gaining insight into both the normal and superconducting properties of these systems .",
    "zinc is known to produce a universal rate of @xmath0 depression in la , y , bi and tl based high temperature superconductors@xcite , lending support to a universal pairing mechanism in these cuprates .",
    "it is also known to severely affect normal state electronic transport properties , @xcite for example inducing semiconducting behaviour in otherwise metallic cuprates.@xcite the magnetic behaviour of the high @xmath0 oxides is also modified in the presence of zinc .",
    "antiferromagnetic order is destroyed @xcite ( albeit not as rapidly as superconductivity ) and there is a dramatic effect on dynamical spin fluctuations . whilst the underdoped cuprates are known to possess a spin pseudo gap , kakurai _ et.al._@xcite have shown that unlike pure @xmath2 , zinc doped @xmath3 has no gap like structure in the spin fluctuation spectrum , on the contrary there is a significant enhancement in spectral weight at low frequencies .",
    "it has been suggested that these normal state effects and the observed reduction in @xmath0 are related to the formation of local moments observed in the vicinity of the zinc dopants.@xcite these moments can be detected by nmr techniques @xcite and contribute a curie law paramagnetism to the magnetic susceptibility.@xcite the purpose of this paper is to discuss from a theoretical viewpoint , the formation of such local moments and how they relate to antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "recently there has been a considerable amount of interest in local moment formation and its effects on magnetic and superconducting behaviour .",
    "yet there are relatively few theoretical works@xcite which attempt to show microscopically how such local moments may form in a two dimensional strongly correlated fermion system . to date",
    ", it has been generally believed that zinc substitution results in a zn@xmath4 ion situated at a copper site in the superconducting planes .",
    "this zinc ion is in a closed @xmath5 configuration and hence the @xmath6 holes of the cu lattice scatter off a static impurity of , from their perspective , very high energy .",
    "we wish to suggest here that one can not assume automatically that the zinc atom is in this valence state .",
    "the valency of an atom is effected by its surrounding medium . accordingly , it is not clear that the role of the zinc @xmath7 orbital can be immediately discarded from the conceptual framework , particularly when @xmath6 fermions which are experiencing strong coulomb repulsion are present .",
    "in fact , hao _",
    "et . al._@xcite have shown in an electronic structure calculation of @xmath8 , that the partial density of states of the @xmath7 orbital is peaked right at the fermi energy .",
    "more ab - initio calculations are required to produce a clearer picture on this point .    in this work",
    "we consider local moment formation in a model which reflects the fact that the zinc @xmath6 electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus ( absence of holes ) whilst allowing a coupling between the local @xmath7 orbital and the itinerant states of the cu planar network . to this",
    "end our model possesses both hubbard and anderson type qualities .",
    "we show that , depending on various coupling strengths , local moments are able to form within the hubbard gap and above and below the hubbard bands , with spectral weight on and near to the impurity sites .",
    "further , we show that the transverse spin susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath9 ( the lattice spacing is set to unity ) indeed gains spectral weight at low frequencies due to the presence of such local moments .",
    "our model hamiltonian is the following : @xmath10 where @xmath11 the creation operator @xmath12 creates a hole in a @xmath6 copper orbital at lattice site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 whilst @xmath15 destroys a @xmath6 hole with spin @xmath14 at lattice site @xmath16 .",
    "the first term in @xmath17 represents nearest neighbour hopping on a square lattice and the second term is the usual hubbard interaction between @xmath6 holes at the same site .",
    "the last term is @xmath18 is simply the @xmath7 orbital energy level where @xmath19 is the energy difference between the copper @xmath6 and zinc @xmath7 hole orbitals .",
    "the creation operator @xmath20 creates a hole in a zinc @xmath7 orbital with spin @xmath14 .",
    "the index @xmath21 labels the impurity sites while @xmath22 labels an impurity site s first nearest neighbours .",
    "the energy @xmath23 is the difference between copper and zinc @xmath6 hole states . here",
    "@xmath24 whilst @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the chemical potential of the @xmath6 system .",
    "thus @xmath27 represents static impurity scattering of @xmath6 holes off the zinc sites whilst @xmath28 reflects a coupling between the localised @xmath7 states and the continuum .    in two dimensions",
    "the hubbard model itself has proven to be rather difficult when it comes to theoretical analysis .",
    "consequently , the presence of extra terms in our initial hamiltonian makes our analytical task no easier . to this end",
    ", we employ the finite @xmath29 slave boson method of kotliar and ruckenstein@xcite ( kr ) which , at the mean field level , is in reasonable agreement with monte carlo data on the one band 2d hubbard model@xcite , and has had similar success with the three band hubbard model.@xcite we use this technique to generate the antiferromagnetic long range order which the 2d hubbard model is believed to possess at half filling.@xcite we are then able to consider the effect of the one body terms @xmath30 and @xmath28 . while our treatment is not self - consistent in the sense the we do not use the effect of @xmath27 and @xmath28 to recalculate the various bosonic parameters of the kr method , a hartree fock self consistent study of a similar model shows that corrections to this approximation are of higher order only.@xcite    to generate the antiferromagnetic host we introduce four auxiliary boson fields representing each possible configuration of the @xmath6 orbital at a particular site.@xcite that is , a @xmath6 orbital may be empty , singly occupied with a spin @xmath14 or doubly occupied .",
    "the fermionic creation operator is mapped @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 there is a conjugate mapping for the fermionic destruction operator . the boson fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent empty , single with spin @xmath14 an double occupation of the @xmath6 orbital at a site @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ensures that the mapping becomes trivial in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "unphysical states arising from the enlargened hilbert space are eliminated via the following constraints : @xmath37 and @xmath38 which imply charge conservation and completeness of the bosonic operators respectively . introducing the constraints into the hamiltonian @xmath18 via lagrange multipliers we have , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    to accommodate the antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model we split the square lattice into two sub - lattices @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the symmetry of this phase implies @xmath43 in terms of the bosons , @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 we also have @xmath47 .",
    "the partition function corresponding to @xmath18 can be calculated exactly in the fermion sector and at the saddle point in the boson sector ( where the bosonic fields become @xmath48 numbers ) .",
    "the self consistent mean field equations can then be solved . at half filling the chemical potential @xmath49 .    at the mean field level ,",
    "the quasiparticle bandstructure is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the 2d square lattice tight binding band structure , @xmath52 and @xmath53 which refers to the upper and lower hubbard bands respectively .",
    "the quasiparticle amplitudes on each sub - lattice are : @xmath54 and by symmetry , @xmath55 where @xmath56 refers to the @xmath41 sub - lattice and @xmath57 to the @xmath42 sub - lattice .",
    "the green s function of @xmath18 may be written as , @xmath58 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the green s function for the continuum states and is itself a @xmath60 matrix because of the sub - lattice structure .",
    "the green s function @xmath61 is due to the localised @xmath7 state .",
    "specifically , they are ; @xmath62 \\frac{1}{\\omega - e_{{{\\bf k}}\\nu\\sigma } \\pm i\\eta}\\ ] ] and @xmath63 where @xmath64 refers to the upper and lower hubbard bands respectively .",
    "we initially consider the effect of one zinc impurity positioned on the @xmath41 sub - lattice .",
    "formally it is simpler to first take into account the effect of @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath65- matrix expression for the continuum green s function in real space is : @xmath66 and of course @xmath67 .",
    "including now the scattering contributions of @xmath28 , the full continuum green s function of @xmath68 in real space is : @xmath69 and the full local state green s function can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a self energy given by @xmath72 .",
    "the poles of @xmath73 and @xmath74 give the discrete states of the system .",
    "they are given by the solution of @xmath75 note that in the limit @xmath76 we recover the discrete @xmath7 state .",
    "to determine if the discrete states ( which are the solutions of eq.([poles ] ) ) are localised in nature we can calculate the probability of finding a particle with spin @xmath14 occupying one of these states at the impurity site or at its nearest neighbours through the residues of the appropriate green s functions . for example , for the @xmath7 state we use res@xmath77 $ ] , for the @xmath6 state at the @xmath21 site we have res@xmath78 $ ] and for the nearest neighbour @xmath6 states we use res@xmath79 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath80 is the energy of the discrete state in question .",
    "we have used in our calculations a value of @xmath81 which produces a gap of @xmath82 and a chemical potential for the half filled @xmath6 antiferromagnetic system of @xmath83 .",
    "we have also set the impurity @xmath6 orbital energy at @xmath84 .",
    "this enables us to explore as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath86 the nature of the discrete states which form in the whole system .",
    "it is appropriate to first discuss the energy structure of the various orbital energy levels and quasiparticle bands . in fig.1",
    "we show this relationship .",
    "the copper @xmath6 hole orbital energy is used as a reference .",
    "the two quasiparticle bands are shown as well as where the fermi level sits and the quantity @xmath87 .",
    "thus when @xmath88 one is considering a zinc @xmath7 hole level roughly @xmath89 below the copper @xmath6 hole level .",
    "a large value of @xmath90 would be favourable for zinc to acquire a valency of @xmath91 as the @xmath7 discrete state would become occupied by holes .",
    "solutions to eq.([poles ] ) for @xmath24 and for any values of @xmath87 and @xmath86 produce two discrete states above the upper hubbard band ( in the hole picture ) . with increasing @xmath23 they become completely localised to the impurity @xmath6 orbital .",
    "accordingly they represent localised zinc @xmath6 electrons .",
    "the appearance of gap states or states below the lower band depends on the combination of the above parameters .    without any coupling to the @xmath7 state the system produces one gap state @xcite which has a reasonable amount of spectral weight on its nearest neighbours , producing a local moment . in the limit",
    "@xmath92 the spectral weight of the gap state is completely removed from the impurity site . in general , for fixed @xmath84 , a coupling to the @xmath7 state produces one or two extra gap states depending on @xmath86 and @xmath85 .",
    "these are the remnants of the @xmath7 localised states however some of their spectral weight has been shifted to the nearest neighbours by differing amounts depending on spin , which in effect produces a local moment occupying the @xmath7 state . in fig.2",
    "we give an example of the graphical form of eq.([poles ] ) for a parameter set of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "= 8.6 cm = 8.6 cm    we can see by the intersections with the horizontal axis in fig.2 , that two gap states have formed as have two states above the hole upper band .",
    "these last two states are strongly localised in the zinc @xmath6 orbital and show that this orbital is filled with electrons .",
    "the up spin gap state has amplitude mainly on the zinc neighbours however the down spin gap state has amplitude mainly in the zinc @xmath7 orbital .",
    "thus we have two local moment contributions .",
    "one situated at the zinc site and one spread mainly over the nearest neighbours .",
    "both spins are in opposite alignment to the antiferromagnetically aligned moments of their respective sub - lattices .",
    "both localised gap states are able to act as unpaired moments which should contribute a curie like behaviour to the temperature dependent susceptibility . with more impurity doping and therefore more localised states ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlation length will be reduced leading to an eventual loss of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "calculations by sen _ et al._@xcite have shown that in the presence of local moments , the spin - wave stiffness vanishes beyond a certain length scale , destroying long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "= 8.6 cm = 8.6 cm    for @xmath95 if @xmath85 is situated in the gap then an up spin gap state and a down spin gap state form with large amplitudes in the @xmath7 orbital and thus there is no local moment contribution from the @xmath7 states .",
    "accordingly the zinc atom is nearly inert .",
    "an additional up spin gap state forms with amplitude mainly on the neighbouring sites producing a local moment .",
    "if however @xmath87 is situated within a small energy window between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , then the up spin gap state with amplitude mainly on the @xmath7 orbital is lost , leaving only the down spin state which in effect leads to a local moment at the zinc site .",
    "there is still a local moment from the remaining up spin gap state whose amplitude is found mainly on neighbouring sites . if @xmath87 is too negative then hole bound states are formed below the bands in the @xmath7 orbitals . in fig.3",
    "we show the net moment produced by the discrete states as a function of @xmath85 in units of @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "it can be seen that the valence of a zinc impurity can not be simply assumed to be @xmath91 .",
    "our purpose here has been to show that the valence of a zinc atom can only be considered in the presence of strongly correlated @xmath6 fermions .",
    "it is instructive to examine the effect of localised states on spin fluctuation excitations .",
    "attempts at calculating the spin fluctuation spectrum of an itinerant antiferromagnet such as the 2d hubbard model have generally involved a mean field plus rpa type approach@xcite which attempts to incorporate gaussian fluctuations around the antiferromagnetic saddle point .",
    "this avenue of attack has been successful in producing low frequency spin wave modes in the large @xmath29 limit with dispersion which agrees with linear spin wave theory of the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite here , we do not attempt to calculate a renormalised susceptibility by including fluctuations , but instead we calculate the modification of the bare susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic mean field state due to the presence of local moments in an attempt to illustrate that the presence of local moments causes an increase in spectral weight in the spin fluctuation spectrum , particularly at low frequencies .    even at this level the full calculation is in general quite complicated .",
    "thus , as an example we calculate the contributions from localised states produced purely by the impurity energy @xmath23 .",
    "thus we set @xmath100 and so ignore any contributions from localised states formed by coupling of the conduction holes to the localised @xmath7 state .",
    "the transverse spin fluctuations of the rigid antiferromagnetic host can be described by a 2x2 matrix @xmath101\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 label the sub - lattices and the elements of @xmath104 are defined as @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are either @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "the full spin susceptibility matrix elements are similarly defined .",
    "that is , we have @xmath108    for simplicity we assume a small concentration of impurities distributed evenly over the two sub - lattices such that multiple scattering from different sites may be safely neglected .",
    "the diagonal continuum green s functions can be written in momentum space as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the concentration of impurities on the @xmath106 sub - lattice .",
    "the diagonal components of the susceptibility can be calculated by carrying out contour integrations in the upper and lower halves of the complex plane , making sure to take into account the poles on the real axis due to the discrete states .    in fig.4",
    "we have evaluated at @xmath9 the imaginary part of the localised state contributions to the diagonal components of @xmath111 up to first order in impurity concentration of @xmath112 ( full curve ) .",
    "we have calculated the contributions to the spectral weight of spin fluctuations by scattering processes within the bands and they are negligible .",
    "the dashed curves are the sum of the imaginary parts of the diagonal components of @xmath113 . at this level",
    "they represent particle - hole excitations only .",
    "we have set @xmath114 which produces for each impurity one gap state and two states above the upper hubbard band in the hole picture .",
    "it can be seen that the contribution from these localised states is an enhancement in the spectral weight at low frequencies .",
    "the increase in spectral weight at low frequencies would be further enhanced if one were to include the off diagonal processes which contribute to @xmath115 ( which are due to inter sub lattice excitations ) , as well as the contribution from any extra localised states produced by a coupling of the itinerant states to the zinc @xmath7 states via @xmath86 .",
    "= 8.6 cm = 8.6 cm    indeed if this increase in spectral weight is also produced away from half filling then this phenomena may go some way in explaining how the spin pseudo gap in the underdoped compounds vanishes with zinc doping . as tallon _",
    "et al._@xcite have pointed out , for a small amount of zinc doping the pseudo gap is suppressed near the vicinity of the dopants and may be completely suppressed when the mean spacing between zinc atoms falls below the pseudo gap correlation length .    in this picture superconductivity",
    "would also be extinguished when the pair correlation length falls below the mean spacing between zinc atoms .",
    "pair breaking could occur via the abrikosov - gorkov mechanism due to effective magnetic scattering , however there is evidence to suggest that this effect is too small to account for the rapid reduction of @xmath0.@xcite if the order parameter has @xmath116 symmetry then in addition to the this , strong potential scattering from the zinc impurities may be enough to suppress @xmath117 at a rate seen by experiment .    alternatively , if in the underdoped materials , the formation of a spin pseudo gap is related to the formation of local singlet pairs , then suppression of this gap due to an increase in spin excitation spectral weight may also be a possible explanation for the reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "we have attempted to show that when substituting zinc for copper within the copper oxide planes one can not assume that zinc is in the @xmath91 state .",
    "rather , its valency is sensitive to the presence of a strongly correlated system .",
    "we have shown that local moment formation is possible on and near the zinc sites and that they produce an enhancement of the low energy spectral weight of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
