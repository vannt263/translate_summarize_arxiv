    "in the standard model of core accretion , the formation of a giant planet ocurrs by four principal stages ( ( * ? ? ? * pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fortier et al . 2009 ) ) :    * first , a solid core is formed by the accretion of planetesimals , * this solid core binds the surrounding gas and a gaseous envelope grows in hydrostatic equilibrium , * initially , the planetesimal accretion rate is higher than the gas accretion rate , so the solid core grows faster than the gaseous envelope , but when the mass of the envelope equals the mass of the core the planet triggers the gas accretion and big quantities of gas are accreted in a short period of time , * finally , for some mechanism poorly understood the planet stops the accretion of gas and evolves in isolation , contracting and cooling at constant mass .    the mass of the core to start the gaseous runaway phase is found to be @xmath0 ( although , recent works showed that if the envelope s grain opacity is lower than the values of the ism ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* movshovitz et al . 2010 ) ) or if there is an increment of the envelope s abundance of heavy elements ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hori & ikoma , 2011 ) ) , the critical core mass could be much lower than in the classical scenario ) .",
    "so , the real bottleneck for giant planet formation in the core accretion model , is the growth of the critical core mass before the dissipation of the disk . in a recent work ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guilera et al . 2014 ) ) , we found that if planetesimal fragmentation is taken into account , the formation of massive cores in a few millon years is only possible starting with a population of big planetesimals ( of 100  km of radius ) and massive disks , and if most of the mass loss in planetesimal collisions is distributed in larger fragments .",
    "however , in this work the migration of the planet is neglected .",
    "the exchange of angular momentum between the planet and the gaseous disk forces the planet to migrate along the disk , entering in new zones of the population of planetesimals which could help in the formation of a massive core ( ( * ? ? ? * alibert et al .",
    "2005 b ) ) . in this new work ,",
    "we incorporate type i migration in our global model of giant planet formation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guilera et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "following the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alibert et al .",
    "( 2005 a ) ) , we incorporated type i migration in our model of giant planet formation .",
    "we also used the prescription derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tanaka et al . ( 2002 ) ) , with an ad - hoc reduction factor , to calculate the velocity migration of the planet given by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath3 is the reduction factor , and @xmath4 is the angular momentum of the planet .",
    "@xmath5 is the total torque , which is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the values of the keplerian frequency , the sound speed , and the gas surface density at the position of the planet , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath10 is defined by : @xmath11 the rest of the model is the same as the one described in guilera et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 , 2014 ) .",
    "we studied the formation of a giant planet ( until the planet s core reaches the critical mass ) with an initial semi - major axis of 5  au .",
    "we focused on the comparison of two cases : the in situ formation of the planet , and when the planet migrates in the disk under type i migration .",
    "we considered an initial homogeneous population of planetesimals of 100  km of radius and a disk ten times more massive than the minimum mass solar nebula ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hayashi , 1981 ) ) .",
    "as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guilera et al . ( 2014 ) ) , we carried out two sets of simulations : when the population of planetesimals evolves by planet accretion and planetesimal migration ( hereafter case a ) , and when the population of planetesimals evolves by planet accretion , planetesimal migration and planetesimal fragmentation ( hereafter case b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot ( for the case a ) the time evolution of the planet s semi - mayor axis ( left panel ) and the time evolution of core mass and envelope mass ( right panel ) for the case of in situ formation ( @xmath12 ) , and for different values of the reduction factor of type i migration .",
    "we found that the planet quickly achieves the inner radius of the disk ( at 0.7 au ) if type i migration is not strongly reduced ( @xmath13 ) or not considered .",
    "moreover , only when @xmath12 and @xmath14 the planet core reaches the critical mass before the dissipation of the disk ( 6 myr ) . for these cases ,",
    "when planet migration is considered in the model , the planet reaches the critical core mass in @xmath15  myr , implying a reduction of @xmath16% in time respect to the case of in situ formation .",
    "this is due to an increment in the planetesimal surface density at the planet s feeding zone as a consequence of the inward migration of the planet ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , bottom left panel , curve c ) .    for case b , we considered only the cases when @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig2 ] represents the time evolution of : the planet s semi - mayor axis ( top left panel ) , core mass and envelope mass ( top right panel ) , the mean value of the total planetesimal surface density at the planet feeding zone ( bottom left panel ) , and the total planetesimal accretion rate ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "when planetesimal fragmentation and planet migration are considered the planet reaches the critical core mass in @xmath17  myr .",
    "this implies a reduction in the time of @xmath18% in comparison to the case of planet migration without planetesimal fragmentation ( curve c ) , @xmath19% in comparison to the case of in situ formation considering planetesimal fragmentation ( curve b ) , and @xmath20% in comparison to the case of in situ formation without planetesimal fragmentation ( curve a ) .",
    "we note that despite the total planetesimal surface density in the planet s feeding zone for the case when planetesimal fragmentation and planet migration are considered ( bottom left panel , curve d ) being smaller than the case when only planet migration is considered ( bottom left panel , curve c ) , the time at which the planet reaches the critical core mass is shorter ( top right panel , curves d and c , respectively ) .",
    "this is because the accretion of small fragments ( when planetesimal fragmentation is considered ) causes that the total planetesimal accretion rate becomes greater ( bottom right panel , curves d and c , respectively ) .",
    "our results are in concordance with those found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alibert et al .",
    "( 2005 b ) ) : the migration of the planet favors the formation of a massive core .",
    "the combination of planet migration and planetesimal fragmentation reduces the time at which the planet reaches the critical core mass more than 50% in comparison to the case of in situ formation without planetesimal fragmentation .",
    "we remark that the accretion of small fragments ( products of the planetesimal fragmentation ) increases the total planetesimal accretion rate of the planet even if the planetesimal surface density is smaller than the case where planetesimal fragmentation is not considered .",
    "finally , we note that if type i migration is not strongly reduced the planet quickly reaches the inner radius of the disk and does not reach the critical core mass .",
    "however , if moderate migration is considered , together with planetesimal fragmentation , the planet reaches the critical core mass in a few millon years . this result could have important implications linking models that invoke the need for an inward migration of a proto jupiter ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walsh et al . 2011 ) ) and models that invoke the need for a population of initial big planetesimals ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morbidelli et al . 2009 ) ) ."
