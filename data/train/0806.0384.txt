    "what determines the upper limit to the luminosity of a galaxy ?",
    "this question has received a great deal of attention lately because the answer seems to involve feedback from a galaxy s nucleus .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation show that feedback of some kind is necessary to account for the observed characteristics of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "models without feedback overpredict the number of both low - luminosity and high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "plausible amounts of feedback from supernovae bring predictions for low - luminosity galaxies into agreement with observations , but getting things right at the high - luminosity end is more difficult  the amount of supernova feedback needed to quench star formation in these systems is implausibly large @xcite",
    ". numerical simulations of galaxy formation treat the physics of merging and cooling more realistically but still do not solve the problem of the high - luminosity cutoff . in current simulations ,",
    "late - time cooling of hot gas in the central galaxies of clusters produces so many stars at @xmath2 that the galaxies have luminosities several times larger than the observed cutoff in the galaxy luminosity function and colors that are much too blue ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a closely related cooling problem has long bedeviled our understanding of galaxies and galaxy clusters , and x - ray observations strongly suggest that the solution lies with active galactic nuclei . in roughly half of nearby clusters , the cooling time at @xmath3  kpc is less than a hubble time , implying that gas at the center of the cluster must cool and condense , if there is no mechanism to offset cooling .",
    "however , the star - formation rates in these systems are at most 1% to 10% of the expected gas condensation rate , and x - ray spectroscopy shows that the the bulk of the central gas remains suspended at temperatures @xmath4 of the virial temperature ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "high - resolution imaging with _",
    "chandra _ has revealed that many clusters and giant elliptical galaxies with short central cooling times also have cavities in their icm that coincide with radio - emitting plasma outflows from the active nucleus in the central galaxy . in many cases the agn energy output inferred from these cavities",
    "is similar to the x - ray cooling rate of the central gas  a strong piece of circumstantial evidence in favor of agn feedback as the mechanism that limits cooling and star formation in high - mass halos @xcite .",
    "not all clusters with short central cooling times have obvious cavities , but that finding can be understood if agn heating is episodic .",
    "the most recent versions of semi - analytic models have therefore incorporated schematic implementations of agn feedback and find that  radio - mode \" feedback is a plausible explanation for both the observed cutoff in the galaxy luminosity function and the fact that the largest galaxies in the universe are red , not blue @xcite . to match the observations ,",
    "radio - mode feedback must occur preferentially in high - temperature systems and must provide enough feedback energy to suppress star formation without making many stars . in this context ,",
    "agn feedback is most effective in systems experiencing hot - mode accretion because an extended hot galactic atmosphere is necessary to halt and thermalize the energy of the agn outflow .",
    "here we consider the implications of two recent studies showing that star formation in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) is closely linked to the entropy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more background ) .",
    "] structure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "section  2 presents evidence that star formation occurs only in bcgs whose central entropy is @xmath1 , equivalent to a cooling time @xmath5  years .",
    "the star formation rates in these systems are generally much smaller than the gas cooling rates in the absence of feedback , and understanding why star formation still proceeds at a reduced rate is likely to tell us something about the coupling between agn feedback and the icm . in section",
    "3 we suggest that the critical central entropy threshold for star formation is determined by electron thermal conduction , because multiphase structure can not persist in the icm if the central entropy is much larger than the observed threshold . if conduction is indeed responsible for governing the rate of star formation , then it is also likely to be a major conduit of thermal energy in the cluster core and a crucial part of the agn feedback loop .",
    "section  4 summarizes the paper .",
    "star formation in brightest cluster galaxies has long been known to correlate with the central cooling time of the host cluster .",
    "@xcite showed that h@xmath0 nebulosity is present in a bcg only if the cluster s cooling time is less than a hubble time , and much of the h@xmath0 emission seen in these objects can be attributed to photoionization by hot stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it is possible that some of the h@xmath0 comes from other sources like conductive interfaces ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , turbulent mixing layers @xcite , or cosmic rays @xcite , there is a clear connection between h@xmath0 emission and the presence of extended excess blue light within the bcg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , clusters with short central cooling times also often have substantial co luminosities , indicating that they contain enough cool molecular gas to support the observed level of star - formation @xcite .",
    "two recent studies have brought the star - formation threshold into sharper focus .",
    "chandra _ archival survey of galaxy clusters by @xcite that measured the radial entropy profiles of 222 galaxy clusters , fitting them with the three - parameter expression @xmath6 here we will refer to @xmath7 as the central entropy , although in some cases it is not necessarily the minimum entropy level of the icm but rather the entropy scale at which the radial profile departs from the best - fitting power law at large radii .",
    "figure  [ ha - k0 ] shows that central h@xmath0 emission has been detected only in clusters with @xmath8 ( cavagnolo et al .",
    "emission - line luminosities in this plot have been taken from the literature and correspond to a variety of apertures , so the quantitative values of @xmath9 are not very meaningful . however , the entropy threshold for having detectable h@xmath0 emission is quite distinct .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0 emission clearly indicates that the intracluster medium can have a multiphase structure below this entropy threshold , with a component at @xmath10  k in addition to the x - ray emitting component at @xmath11  k.    observations of color gradients in bcgs have led to a similar conclusion . in a sample of 46 clusters , @xcite find that 34 of the 20 clusters with central entropy @xmath12 have bcgs with extended blue light in their cores consistent with ongoing star formation , while none of the clusters with central entropy @xmath13 have bcgs with colors bluer than expected from a passively evolving stellar population ( see figure  [ bluegrad - k0 ] . ) here the central entropy has been measured from a small x - ray aperture @xmath14 at the center of the cluster , and the color gradients have been measured in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the transition to h@xmath0 emission and star formation is sharp in both cases , but it is not yet clear whether the threshold ought to be expressed in terms of central entropy or central cooling time .",
    "here we are presenting the results as a function of central entropy because we are going to interpret them in terms of the icm entropy structure in the next section .",
    "however , it is interesting that the central cooling times at which h@xmath0 and blue light appear are substantially smaller than @xmath19  years .",
    "simply having gas that is able to cool within a hubble time is not enough for star formation in a bcg .",
    "some other more restrictive condition must also be satisfied .",
    "it is also interesting that in both figures there are clusters with central entropy @xmath20 and cooling time @xmath21  years that do not show evidence for star formation .",
    "low entropy and a correspondingly short cooling time are therefore not sufficient to guarantee star formation .",
    "rafferty et al .",
    "( 2008 ) present evidence suggesting that star formation proceeds only if the agn heating rate is less than the gas cooling rate and the central galaxy is close to the x - ray brightness peak .",
    "we suspect that the critical entropy threshold for multiphase gas and star formation in bcgs may result from electron thermal conduction .",
    "cool star - forming clouds should appear only in systems whose size is greater than a critical length scale , known as the _ field length _ , below which thermal conduction smoothes out temperature inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "one can derive the field length heuristically by considering thermal balance for a cool cloud of radius @xmath22 embedded in a medium of temperature @xmath23 .",
    "electron thermal conduction sends energy into the cloud at a rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the spitzer conduction coefficient and @xmath26 is a suppression factor depending on the magnetic field structure in the medium .",
    "radiative cooling can rid the cloud of energy at a rate @xmath27 , where the cooling function @xmath28 for @xmath29  kev .",
    "cooling and conduction are therefore in approximate balance for systems with a radius of order the field length , @xmath30^{1/2 }       = 4   \\ , { \\rm kpc } \\ ;   \\left [ \\frac { k } { 10 \\ , { \\rm kev \\ ,",

    "the long - dashed lines give the loci of points for which @xmath31 , given suppression factors @xmath32 and 1 .",
    "magnetic suppression of conduction is a complicated and incompletely understood process , but most recent estimates have been in the range @xmath33-@xmath34 @xcite . below each line ,",
    "gas within radius @xmath22 constitutes a subsystem with @xmath35 .",
    "conduction can not stabilize that gas against cooling , allowing multiphase gas to persist and star formation to proceed .",
    "above each line is the region of stability , in which conduction leads to evaporation and homogeneity .    for comparison ,",

    ", a threshold must exist in the @xmath44-@xmath22 plane above which conduction heats and evaporates cooler gas clouds faster than radiative losses can cool them .",
    "one therefore expects to see a transition from a multiphase icm at low central entropy levels to a more homogeneous , isothermal icm at higher entropy levels .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations are indicating that this transition is at approximately the expected location in the @xmath44-@xmath22 plane for thermal conduction with @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the presence of such a threshold is independent of the origin of the line - emitting gas , which could come either from condensation of the icm or from stripping of cool interstellar clouds from galaxies passing through the cluster core .",
    "stripped gas in an ambient medium above the critical @xmath45 profile would quickly evaporate , while stripped gas in a medium below the profile could persist indefinitely .",
