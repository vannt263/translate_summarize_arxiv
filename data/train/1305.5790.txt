    "when the limit @xmath13 is taken in the lippmann - schwinger equation it results that only one counterterm is operative for attractive singular potentials and none for the repulsive singular ones @xcite .",
    "this scheme is too rigid from the point of view of effective field theory which implies deficiencies in the description of some @xmath0 partial waves compared with data as well as the loss of order - by - order improvement in the predictions in those cases .",
    "this has been recently analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite up to n@xmath7lo . on the other hand ,",

    "@xcite in chpt .",
    "one of the main aims of the work is to show quantitatively that the referred chiral expansion of the discontinuity of a @xmath0 partial wave amplitude is meaningful .",
    "the leading contribution to this imaginary part is ope , @xmath15 , and both of the subleading ones , once - iterated ope and irreducible tpe , have typically similar sizes , as we show below , and could be booked in the chiral counting as the latter , which is explicitly @xmath16 .",
    "it is also shown that further contributions to the discontinuity along the lhc by increasing the numbers of pion ladders in @xmath0 reducible diagrams are more suppressed because they contribute only deeper in the complex plane and move further away from the low - energy physical region .",

    "@xcite is the way that @xmath0 partial waves with orbital angular momentum ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 and the mixing partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath19 @xmath20 are treated in order to fulfil the right threshold behavior , which requires that they vanish as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , for @xmath23 .",
    "here and in the following we denote the center - of - mass - frame ( c.m . ) three - momentum squared by @xmath24 .",

    "a @xmath0 partial wave amplitude in the three - momentum squared plane ( that we call the @xmath24 plane ) has two disjoint cuts .",

    "it comprises the elastic cut with two - nucleon intermediate states , as well as the inelastic cuts , whose lighter thresholds are due to @xmath43-pion production giving contribution for @xmath44 , with @xmath27 the pion mass and @xmath45 the nucleon mass .",

    "@xcite to study @xmath53 scattering .    in the rest of this section",
    "we skip the subscripts @xmath54 since we always refer to a definite @xmath0 partial wave .",

    "in refs .  @xcite and @xcite the input function @xmath28 was calculated from ope .",

    "the relevant feynman diagrams are depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ nnbar ] , where the solid lines are nucleons , the dashed lines are pions and the angular lines indicate how each diagram should be cut to give contribution to @xmath105 . from left to right in fig .",
    "[ nnbar ] , the first diagram is ope , the second and third ones correspond to irreducible tpe , while the last one is once - iterated ope .",

    "[ nnbar ] along the lhc is finite . when cutting the loop diagrams for tpe , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ nnbar ] , an extra dirac - delta function originates ( beyond those required by energy - momentum conservation ) that reduces the momentum integration to a finite domain .    it is known since long @xcite that @xmath0 irreducible diagrams are amenable to a chiral expansion .",
    "this source of @xmath28 could then be calculated perturbatively and improved order by order in the chiral expansion in a systematic way . in the standard chiral counting @xcite , ope is @xmath15 and leading irreducible tpe is @xmath16 .     ]    regarding the @xmath0 reducible diagrams , they give contribution to @xmath28 by cutting the ope ladders .",
    "indeed , an @xmath43-time iterated ope diagram , see fig .",
    "[ ntimesope ] , contributes only to @xmath28 by putting on - shell all the @xmath43 pion lines , that is , for @xmath106 .",
    "this is obvious if we keep in mind the fact that the schrdinger propagator for each of the @xmath0 intermediate states can not be cut because it is proportional to @xmath107 , with @xmath108 a three - momentum that stems from the linear combination of loop and external three - momenta , and @xmath109 .",
    "then , from cutkosky rules , the cutting of just one pion line requires to cut the rest of lines because no nucleon line can be cut for @xmath109 and the angular line in fig .",
    "[ ntimesope ] must go through all the pion ladders , as shown in the figure .",
    "this establishes a natural hierarchy of pion ladders at low energies , because by adding one extra ladder we move deeper in the lhc and then further away from the low - energy physical region that has @xmath110 . for a given @xmath0 reducible diagram with @xmath43 pion ladders we can also consider its chiral corrections , which will be relatively suppressed by higher orders in the chiral expansion with respect to the simplest diagram with @xmath43 pion ladders , depicted in fig .",
    "[ ntimesope ] , which is calculated from the lowest - order @xmath111 lagrangian .",
    "then , increasing both the number of pions exchanged and the chiral order of the calculation reduce the weight of a diagram to @xmath28 at low energies . as we discuss in more detail below in sec .",
    "[ cont_da ] , irreducible and reducible tpe diagrams typically contribute with a similar size to @xmath28 , so that we book the relative suppression of increasing the number of pion ladders by one in a reducible @xmath0 diagram as @xmath16 , the same amount as an irreducible loop calculated with lowest order @xmath104 vertices counts in the chiral expansion . in this way , in order to proceed with the calculation of @xmath28 , for a given @xmath0 irreducible feynman diagram we count its chiral order in the standard manner @xcite and book its contribution to @xmath28 according to the latter . for a @xmath0 reducible diagram ,",
    "a leading two - pion ladder ( calculated with the lowest - order @xmath104 vertex ) counts as @xmath16 and every extra leading pion ladder introduces additionally two extra powers of momentum in the chiral counting . on top of that",
    ", we add the chiral order corresponding to other parts of the diagram that are @xmath0 irreducible , as well as the increase in the chiral order due to perturbative corrections to the leading calculation of pion ladders .",
    "the result of this addition is the final chiral order corresponding to the considered @xmath0 reducible diagram to @xmath28 .",
    "as discussed above , the input function @xmath28 is calculated up to some chiral order in chpt .",
    "the higher the order of the calculation the higher is the maximum divergence of @xmath28 for @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , the latter typically diverges except for the ope case in which it vanishes at least as @xmath113 for @xmath73 .",
    "this can be explicitly checked with the expressions given in appendix [ app.delta ] of @xmath28 obtained from ope in all the partial waves studied in this work . at nlo",
    "the function @xmath28 diverges at most linearly in @xmath24 in the limit @xmath112 , while at n@xmath4lo it does at most as @xmath114 in the same limit .",
    "if we generally set that @xmath115 for @xmath73 , with @xmath116 a real number , we have typically an increase in the value of @xmath116 with the chiral order .",
    "thus , it is an interesting question to settle whether there is a relation between the chiral order up to which @xmath28 is calculated and the minimum number of subtractions needed in the ie for @xmath66 along the lhc ( @xmath117 ) , eq .",
    ", in order to have a well - defined solution .",
    "one should not expect any restriction on the maximum number of subtractions by the requirement that the ie is mathematically meaningful .",
    "indeed , we show below that when @xmath28 is calculated only from ope one has always a unique solution , no matter how large is the number of subtraction taken , because it can be reduced to a fredholm ie of the second kind where the associated kernel and the inhomogeneous term are quadratically integrable .",
    "let us first take the once - subtracted drs for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that @xmath118 and we demonstrate the important result that the once - subtracted drs has a unique solution for @xmath119 .",

    "it reads @xmath133 the symmetric kernel in this ie is @xmath134 which is quadratically integrable for @xmath119 , as well as the inhomogeneous term @xmath135 . as a result of the fredholm theorem @xcite one can guarantee that eq .",
    "has always a unique solution as far as the constant @xmath136 is not an eigenvalue of the kernel @xmath137 given above .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath138 is a function of low - energy physical constants determined within an error interval , so that an infinitesimal change in those constants will make that the resulting @xmath139 is no longer an eigenvalue of the kernel , because there are no accumulation points of the eigenvalues in the finite domain @xcite .",
    "then we can state :    indeed , for any number of subtractions , the resulting ie in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath129 and @xmath130 , once it is symmetrized as in the discussion above , has the same kernel as in eq .  .",
    "this can be understood easily because if one subtraction is added then we have an extra factor @xmath24 in front of the lhc dispersive integral and another @xmath140 inside it . in terms of the variables @xmath129 and @xmath130 this implies the factor @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the @xmath142 s cancel each other and we have one extra @xmath130 and one less @xmath129 in the denominator . as a result ,",
    "when symmetrizing by considering @xmath143 , one has to multiply @xmath127 by one extra @xmath130 , and the same kernel is obtained because the extra @xmath129 is eaten by @xmath144 in order to become @xmath145 inside the integration .",
    "in addition , the inhomogeneous term in the process of adding more subtraction does not become more singular because the extra factor of @xmath146 that appears in the last subtraction terms added is canceled by the extra factor @xmath130 when ending with the symmetric ie for @xmath147 . as a result proposition 1 can be generalized to any number of subtractions :    it is important to realize that when calculating @xmath66 with @xmath28 from ope , one has that @xmath148 with @xmath149 and @xmath43 is a finite natural number .",
    "as a result , the kernel that is obtained proceeding as done previously with @xmath150 is given by eq .",
    "times the polynomial @xmath151 , which does not affect the fact that it is a quadratically integrable kernel for @xmath152 . on the other hand ,",
    "the inhomogeneous term is the same as before and it is quadratically integrable as well , by the same arguments as given above . as a result , we obtain the following important result :    this theorem on the existence of a unique solution of the @xmath1 method when @xmath28 is restricted to its leading contribution from ope , contrasts with the situation found by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with the ope potential .",
    "the latter has a singular behavior diverging as @xmath12 for @xmath153 in the triplet waves and its solution does not follow the standard procedure for non - singular potential in quantum mechanics . in order",
    "to obtain cut - off independent results when using this potential in a lippmann - schwinger equation one needs two s - wave counterterms , one for each @xmath0 s - wave @xcite , as well as in any other partial wave for which the tensor force is attractive @xcite .",
    "the addition of these last counterterms for @xmath30- and higher partial waves violates the naive chiral power counting .",
    "the situation that emerges after resumming relativistic corrections in the nucleon propagator is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
