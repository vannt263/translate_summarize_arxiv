    "one starts with a hermite model hamiltonian @xmath5 with a real parameter @xmath6 . here",

[ fig_1d_2d](a ) ) due to the neumann - wigner non - crossing rule  @xcite . at this point , the overlap between @xmath10 and @xmath7 is exceeded by that between @xmath10 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , due to orthogonality , @xmath10 and @xmath18 exchange their characters in terms of the appropriate basis @xmath7 and @xmath15 at the anticrossing point @xmath19 , which we call `` nature transition '' in this paper .",

    ", we consider the quantum systems with dissipation into decay channels outside of the model space .",
    "such systems are often called _ open quantum systems _ with resonance states , which are effectively described by a non - hermite model hamiltonian @xmath5 with complex energy eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues correspond to the mass and decay width of the resonance states , respectively .",

    "therefore , a simple criterion should be newly found to judge the existence of the nature transition between the resonances , and its critical value @xmath14 can be used to know the internal structure of the resonance states depending on the parameter . in this paper , we construct complex two - dimensional ( 2d ) matrix model to discuss the nature transition between two resonance states .",
