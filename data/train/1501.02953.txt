    "during the last few decades both observations and theory have improved to a level that has made it possible to employ white dwarf ( wd ) stars for estimating ages of stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood ( i.e. , winget et al .",
    "1987 ; garca - berro et al .  1988 ; oswalt et al .",
    "1996 ) , open ( i.e. , richer et al .  1998 ; von hippel  2005 ; bedin et al .  2008a , 2010 ) and globular ( i.e. , hansen et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ; bedin et al .  2009 ) clusters .",
    "methods to determine stellar population ages from their wd cooling sequences are usually based on the comparison of the observed wd luminosity function ( lf  star counts as a function of magnitude ) with theoretical ones calculated from wd isochrones . when considering star clusters , owing to the single ( and finite ) age of their stars , the more massive wds formed from higher - mass short - lived progenitors pile up at the bottom of the cooling sequence ( cs ) , producing a turn to the blue ( a turn towards lower radii ) in the isochrones . at old ages , when the wd @xmath6 decreases below @xmath75000  k , the contribution by collision - induced absorption of molecular hydrogen ( hansen 1998 ) to the opacity in the atmospheres reduces the infrared flux and increase the flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this produces a turn to the blue of the colours of individual cooling tracks , that enhances the blue excursion at the bottom of old wd isochrones .",
    "the existence of a minimum wd luminosity due to the cluster finite age , together with the accumulation of wds of different masses and a general increase of wd cooling times with decreasing luminosity ( at least before the onset of debye cooling ) translates into a peak and cut - off in the lf .",
    "comparisons of observed and predicted absolute magnitudes of the wd lf cut - off provides the population age .",
    "the discovery of a second , brighter peak in the wd lf of the metal - rich open cluster ngc6791 ( see bedin et al .   2005a , 2008a , 2008b for the discovery and possible interpretations ) has raised questions about our understanding of the cs in simple systems like open clusters , and their use for age dating of stellar populations .",
    "in particular , this bright peak has been interpreted by kalirai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as due to a population of massive he - core wds , whilst bedin et al .",
    "( 2008b ) have explained it in terms of a sizable population of wd+wd binaries . as for the fainter peak",
    "expected to be the _ real _ age indicator the age obtained from standard wd models is in conflict ( @xmath3 2gyr younger ) with that derived from the cluster main - sequence ( ms ) turn - off ( to ) , and the age later obtained from the cluster eclipsing binaries studied by brogaard et al .",
    "this discrepancy has led to a detailed reevaluation of the effect of diffusion of @xmath8 in the co core before crystallization sets in ( e.g. , bravo et al .",
    "1992 , deloye & bildsten  2002 ) . as shown by garca - berro et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) with full evolutionary calculations , at the old age and high metallicity of this cluster ( about twice solar ) , the extra - energy contributed by ne - diffusion in the liquid phase slows down substantially the cooling of the models and can bring into agreement wd , to and eclipsing binary ages .",
    "this result highlights very clearly the need for further observations , and the importance of studying wd ages in comparison with to estimates in individual clusters . as",
    "wds lie in one of the least - explored regions of the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we are carrying out a campaign to find out whether the case of ngc6791 is unique or whether other clusters with similar wd css might exist .",
    "our purpose is to extend our knowledge of the dependence of wd lfs on cluster age and metallicity .",
    "so far we have investigated two other open clusters :  ngc2158 from space ( bedin et al .",
    "2010 ) , and m67 from the ground ( bellini et al .",
    "2010 ) ; both of them show canonical wd css ( hence lfs ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the wd cs of another open cluster , ngc6819 , that is within the @xmath5-mission field .",
    "ngc6819 has solar metallicity ( bragaglia et al .",
    "2001 ) , is about a fourth as old as ngc6791 ( anthony - twarog et al .",
    "2013 ) , and somewhat less massive ( as can be inferred from their images in the digital sky survey ) .",
    "section  2 will describe our observations and wd selection , whilst section  3 presents the theoretical analysis of the wd lf .",
    "sections  4 and 5 discuss our proper motion analysis and present the electronic material we make publicly available .",
    "conclusions close the paper .",
    "all data presented here were collected with two different instruments at the focus of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) under two programs taken at different epochs , go-11688 and go-12669 ( on both pi :  bedin ) .    for the first epoch ( go-11688 )",
    "8 orbits were allocated in two filters during october 2009 , while the second epoch ( 4 orbits ) was in october 2012 and used only the redder of the two filters . as primary instrument the ultraviolet - visible ( uvis ) channel of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) gathered images in four contiguous fields ( each 162@xmath9@xmath10162@xmath9 ) organized in a 2@xmath102 array centered on the core of ngc6819 .",
    "the same number of fields were also observed in parallel , with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) ( each 202@xmath9@xmath10202@xmath9 ) , which is located in the _ hst _ focal plane at about @xmath11 from uvis , and with the detector axes oriented at @xmath12 from the wfc3 axes .",
    "thus the primary plus parallel exposures covered a total of about 70 arcmin square in ngc6819 ( see top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .",
    "all collected images were taken in the filters f606w & f814w , which are the optimal choice for our scientific goals , i.e. , the study of the faintest wds in a relatively - old open cluster , and are available for both instruments ( although with different zero points and slightly different colour responses ) .",
    "data were organized in 1-orbit visits per filter and per field .",
    "each orbit consists of one 10s short and 4@xmath10@xmath3600s long exposures for the primary instrument , and 3@xmath10@xmath3470s long exposures for acs . within each orbit both instruments use analogous filters .",
    "the bottom panels of fig.[f1 ] show a stacked image of the regions , after removal of cosmic rays and most of the artifacts .",
    "all images were treated with the procedures described in detail by anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) , to correct positions and fluxes for imperfections in the charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) of both acs / wfc and wfc3/uvis . finally , in all images , we masked - out by hand the ghosts of the brightest stars in the fields .",
    "photometry and relative positions were obtained with the software tools described by anderson et al .",
    "in addition to solving for positions and fluxes , we also computed two important diagnostic parameters : _ quality - fit _ and _ rmssky_. the _ quality - fit _ essentially tells how well the flux distribution resembles the shape of the psf ( defined in anderson et al .",
    "2008 ) ; this parameter can be very useful for eliminating the faint blue galaxies that plague studies of wds ( see bedin et al .",
    "2009 for detailed discussions ) .",
    "the sky - smoothness parameter _",
    "rmssky _ is the rms deviation from the mean , for the pixels in an annulus from 3.5 to 8 pixels from each source . as discussed in bedin et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , _ rmssky _ is invaluable in measuring a more effective completeness than has been used in most previous studies .",
    "the photometry was calibrated to the vega - mag system following the procedures given in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , and using the most updated encircled energy curves and zero points . in the following we will use for these calibrated magnitudes the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the calibration should be good to about 0.02 magnitude per filter .    the acs / wfc parallel fields ,",
    "although useful to derive the present - day mass function in the outskirts of the clusters from the ms stars , are not very useful to study the wd cs , as the handful of wds are outnumbered by the field stars and background galaxies .",
    "there are also fewer acs / wfc images than wfc3/uvis images , and their larger pixels size complicates the identification of true point - sources , and the measurement of proper motions .",
    "also , there are no short exposures for the wfc images , making these data useless for studying the evolved members of ngc6819 .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness and given the interest in this patch of sky , which falls inside the _ kepler _ field , we release the catalogue and atlases for the acs / wfc fields as well ( see sect.[em ] ) .    hereafter , we will use only the wfc3/uvis central field .",
    "in particular , the long exposures of the primary field will be used to study the wd cs of ngc6819 , while the short exposures will allow us to study the brightest and evolved cluster members .",
    "the photometry obtained from the short exposures was corrected for differential reddening as in milone et al .",
    "( 2012 , see their sect .",
    "3 ) , and carefully registered to the zero points of the long exposures using unsaturated common stars .",
    "a precision of @xmath30.01 magnitude per filter was estimated for this operation ; this means that the photometry from short and long exposures should be consistent to this level .    artificial - star ( as ) tests were performed using the procedures described by anderson et al .  ( 2008 ) .",
    "we chose to cover the magnitude range @xmath3@xmath15@xmath16 , with colours that placed the artificial stars on the wd sequence .",
    "these tests played an important role in showing us what selection criteria should be used for the real stars .",
    "the quality of our results depends very much on making a good selection , the details for which are shown in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "( see bedin et al .   2009 , 2010 for a detailed description of the selection procedures .",
    ") panels with unprimed labels refer to real stars , while those with primed labels refer to the artificial stars .",
    "we used the as tests to show what combinations of magnitude and _ quality - fit _ are acceptable for valid star images [ panel ( a@xmath17 ) ] , and we drew the blue lines to isolate the acceptable region .",
    "we then drew identical lines in panel ( a ) , to separate the real stars from blends and probable galaxies .",
    "we went through similar steps for the _ rmssky _ parameter ( panels b@xmath17 and b ) .",
    "finally we plotted cmds and drew dividing lines in a similar way to isolate the white dwarfs ( panels c@xmath17 and c ) from field objects .",
    "thankfully , wds occupy a relatively uncontaminated region of the cmd ( bedin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "as one can see from panels ( a ) and ( a@xmath17 ) , the shape ( i.e. , the _ quality - fit _ ) of the objects becomes increasingly confused with the noise at magnitudes fainter than @xmath13@xmath326 , and therefore a few blue compact background galaxies might have fallen in the list of selected objects .",
    "however , these can not affect the location of the drop of wd star counts , which is the relevant feature studied in our work .",
    "furthermore , the proper motions described in sect.4 , confirm the wd lf cut - off magnitude .",
    "our final step was to deal with completeness , a concept that appears in two different contexts : ( 1 ) the observed number of wds must be corrected for a magnitude - dependent incompleteness .",
    "( 2 ) it is customary to choose the limiting reliable magnitude at the level where the sample is 50% complete . in a star cluster",
    "these two aims need to be treated in quite different ways .",
    "( 1@xmath17 ) to correct for incompleteness the wd lf , we use the traditional ratio of as recovered to the number inserted .",
    "( 2@xmath17 ) for the limit to which measures of faint stars are reliable , however , the 50%-completeness level needs to be chosen in a quite different way , because in a crowded star cluster more faint stars are lost in the brightness fluctuations around the bright stars , than are lost to the fluctuations of the sky background . the completeness measure that we should use to set the 50% limit is therefore the recovered fraction of ass _ only _ among those ass",
    "whose value of _ rmssky _ , as a function of magnitude , indicates that it _ was possible to recover the star_. [ for a more detailed discussion , see sect .   4 of bedin",
    "et al .   (",
    "2008a ) , and for other two similar applications and further discussions see bedin et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ] .",
    "the distinction between the two completeness measures is illustrated in panel ( d ) of fig.[f2 ] , where the black line shows the overall completeness , while the blue line shows the completeness statistics that take _ rmssky _ into account ; its 50% completeness level is at @xmath18 , rather than 26.87mag with the traditional statistics . to emphasize the contrast",
    ", the red line shows the fraction of the area ( i.e. , with low - background ) in which faint stars could have been found .",
    "as in our previous similar works on other clusters , the comparison with theory comprises the determination of a ms to age , and the age implied by the wd lf .",
    "basti scaled - solar isochrones for both wd ( salaris et al .",
    "2010 ) and pre - wd ( pietrinferni et al .   2004 ) evolutionary phases , including ms convective - core overshooting , were used to determine both msto and wd ages .",
    "we considered the available basti ( pre - wd and wd ) isochrones for [ fe / h]=+0.06 , consistent with [ fe / h]=@xmath190.09@xmath200.03 determined spectroscopically for a sample of cluster red clump stars by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001  but see anthony - twarog et al .",
    "2014 for a slightly different estimates , [ fe / h]=@xmath210.06@xmath200.04 , obtained from @xmath22 observations ) .",
    "first we determined the cluster distance modulus from isochrone fitting to the ms .",
    "given that stars above the msto are saturated , we could not use the magnitude of the red clump and the colour of red giant branch stars as constraints .",
    "we have considered the unevolved cluster ms between @xmath23=17 ( about two magnitudes below the msto ) and 19 , and derived a fiducial line by taking the mode of the @xmath24 colour distribution of ms stars in 0.25mag wide @xmath13 bins . before performing a least square fitting of the isochrone mss to the fiducial line , we fixed the cluster @xmath25 to values between 0.10 and 0.18 mag , in steps of 0.01  mag .",
    "we explored this range following the estimate by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who used temperatures of three red clump stars derived from line excitation ( a reddening - free parameter ) and the appropriate theoretical spectra , to determine their intrinsic @xmath26 colours .",

    "2014 determined @xmath25=0.160@xmath200.007 from @xmath22 observations , within the range spanned by bragaglia et al .",
    "estimate ) .",
    "these @xmath25 values between 0.10 and 0.18 magnitudes were then transformed into @xmath27 and @xmath28 as described by bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and assuming @xmath29=3.1 .",
    "for each @xmath30 we finally fitted isochrones of various ages to the fiducial line .",
    "the procedure worked as follows . for a given choice of @xmath25 the vertical shift required to fit the isochrones to the observed ms fiducial line provided the apparent distance modulus .",
    "this is unaffected by the isochrone age , given that we were fitting the unevolved ms .",
    "once derived the apparent distance modulus for a given @xmath25 , we compared magnitude and shape of the isochrones to with the observed cmd , for ages varying between 1.0 and 4.0  gyr .",
    "this comparison allowed us to both estimate the to age and narrow down the range of reddenings consistent with the isochrones .",
    "it turned out that for some @xmath25 values ( and the associated distance moduli ) , around the to region the shape of the isochrone that matched the observed to magnitude was very different from the shape of the cmd .",
    "this implied that the isochrone was too old or too young compared to the real cluster age , so that the to magnitude had matched only on account of an inconsistent distance modulus , and hence an inconsistent reddening .",
    "our isochrone fitting provided @xmath31 , @xmath32 [ corresponding to a distance of 2377pc , and to @xmath33 and a msto age @xmath34gyr .",
    "the total age range was fixed by the youngest and oldest isochrones that bracketed the to region in the observed cmd for , respectively , the shortest and largest distance moduli obtained from the ms fitting .",
    "the error on the distance modulus is an internal error of our isochrone ms - fitting method that combines in quadrature the error of the least square fit at fixed reddening , and the effect of the error on the reddening on the least square fit value .",

    "notice how the termination of the db sequence is brighter than that for the da wds , contrary to the result for typical globular cluster ages , because in this regime he - envelope wds cool down more slowly that the h - envelope counterparts ( see , e.g. , salaris et al .",

    "the mc code calculates the synthetic cmd of a wd population of fixed age ( and initial chemical composition ) by selecting first a value of the progenitor mass for a generic wd along the corresponding wd isochrone ( we assume a burst of star formation with negligible age and metallicity dispersion , appropriate for open clusters ) , according to an imf that is set to salpeter as default choice . the corresponding mass and magnitudes of the _ synthetic _ wd",

    "if the initial mass of the companion has produced a wd , we determine its mass and magnitudes as for single wds . in case",

    "the fluxes of the two components are then added , and the total magnitudes and colours of the composite system are computed .",

    "[ thlfs ] , width=336 ]    in general , the exact shape of the wd lf ( and of the wd sequence in the cmd ) depends on a number of parameters in addition to the cluster age , e.g. , the initial - final - mass relationship , the mass function of the progenitors , the relative fraction of the ( dominant ) da and db objects , the fraction of wd+wd binaries ( and their mass distribution ) and , very importantly , the dynamical evolution of the cluster , which selectively depletes the wds according to their mass and their time of formation . also , in open clusters , if a wd receives a sufficient velocity kick from asymmetric mass loss during its pre - wd evolution , it may become unbound ( see , e.g. , the introduction in williams  2004 ) .    on one hand ,",
    "this is why we are not attempting to match precisely the shape of the whole wd lf , by trying to determine simultaneously the cluster age , the precise fraction of wd+wd binaries , db objects , and the progenitor mf .",
    "these effects are difficult to disentangle using just the observed lf , and complicated by the limited statistic ( total number of observed wds , compared for example with the cases of m4 or ngc6791 ) and by a potential ( although mild ) residual field contamination .",
    "on the other hand , the observed position of the wd lf cut - off , which is the primary wd age indicator , should have been affected very little by any of these parameters . in the following we",
    "quantitatively demonstrate how all the above uncertainties , although potentially affecting the shape of the wd lf , do not alter the magnitude location of the lf cut - off .",
    "first of all , the effect of the dynamical evolution ( see yang et al .",
    "2013 for indications about the dynamical evolution of this cluster ) should be negligible , for the following reason .",
    "the wd isochrones predict that the brighter wds should have nearly a single mass , whereas the region of the wd lf cut - off  i.e. , at the blue - turn at the bottom of the cs  is expected to be populated by objects spanning almost the whole predicted wd mass spectrum ( hence the presence of a blue turn towards lower stellar radii ) . a mass - dependent loss mechanism due to dynamical evolution would therefore alter the number distribution of wds around the blue - turn , but it should have no major effect on the observed location of the cut - off in the wd lf .",

    "as discussed , e.g. , in podsiadlowski  ( 2014 ) , the distribution of @xmath47 in binary systems is not well determined and appears to depend on the mass range .",
    "massive binaries favour stars of comparable mass ( @xmath47@xmath71 ) whilst the situation is less clear for low - mass stars , and most studies show that @xmath47 is possibly consistent with a flat distribution .",

    "the older lf has a fainter termination , and can be excluded by means of the comparison with the position of the observed cut - off .",
    "after this reassessment of the solidity of the lf cut - off as age indicator , we have varied the cluster apparent distance modulus within the range established with the ms fitting and obtained a range of wd ages @xmath58=2.25@xmath200.20  gyr .",
    "this age range has been determined by considering all theoretical lfs that display after the peak a sharp drop in the star counts at the bin centred around @xmath23=26.05 .",
    "notice that the range is narrower than the msto age range , but completely consistent with @xmath59 .",
    "this narrower age range is due to the different sensitivity of to and wd magnitude cut - off to the population age ( salaris  2009a ) .",
    "we close our theoretical analysis presenting two additional tests about our derived wd ages .",
    "first , we have recalculated the basti wd isochrones considering the wd initial - final mass relation ( ifmr ) by kalirai  ( 2009 ) instead of the default ifmr employed by the basti isochrones ( salaris et al .",
    "2009b ) . in the wd progenitor mass range typical of ngc6819 ( progenitor masses above",
    "@xmath31.6 @xmath60 ) , this different ifmr predicts generally slightly lower progenitor masses at fixed wd mass , compared to the basti default ifmr .",
    "this implies that with the kalirai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ifmr wds of a given mass start to cool along the cs at a later time , hence they reach somewhat brighter magnitudes for a given wd isochrone age ( we recall that the wd isochrone age is equal to the sum of the progenitor age plus the wd cooling age ) , compared to the case of the salaris et al .  ( 2009b ) ifmr .",
    "comparisons with the observed lf show that the use of the kalirai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ifmr increases the estimate of the wd age by just 40  myr .    as a second test",
    ", we have considered the da wd cooling tracks by renedo et al .",
    "( 2010  their calculations for metallicity approximately half - solar , the closest to ngc6819 metallicity in their calculations ) , that are completely independent from the basti wd models employed here .",
    "renedo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) calculations follow the complete evolution of the wd progenitors through the thermal pulse phases and include the effect of co phase separation upon crystallization , like basti wd models . the co stratification and envelope thickness of renedo et al .",
    "models ( as well as the model input physics ) are slightly different from basti models , but the cooling times down to the luminosities of the bottom of the observed cs of ngc6819 are similar . from their calculations ,",
    "the match of the cut - off of the observed lf provide an age older by @xmath3100myr compared to the age determined with our reference basti wd models .",
    "in principle a mild contamination from field objects , might also affect the shape of the wd lf , but again , it can not change the magnitude location of the sharp drop off in the wd lf . in this section",
    "we use proper motions to strengthen the cluster membership of the observed stars in the expected cmd location of the wd cs .",
    "proper motions were determined by means of the techniques described in bedin et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 , 2009 , 2014 ) .",
    "we used the deep exposures in f814w collected in october 2009 as first epoch , while we used the f814w exposures taken in october 2012 as second epoch .",
    "the proper motions are calculated as the displacement between the average positions between the two epochs , divided by the time base - line ( about 3 years ) , and finally multiplied by the pixel scale .",
    "we assumed a wfc3/uvis pixel scale of 39.773 maspixel@xmath61 ( bellini , anderson & bedin 2011 ) .",
    "as the proper motions signals are a function of the f814w magnitude only , we plot proper motions properties as a function of this magnitude , rather than f606w .    unfortunately , the cluster has a proper motion that is not significantly different from the bulk of the field objects , and our precision is too low for an accurate discrimination between field objects and cluster members , especially at the magnitudes of the faintest wds .",
    "furthermore , proper motions are not available for all sources , with an incompleteness that is hard to assess quantitatively ( and reliably ) ; the precision of the derived proper motions is also heterogeneous across the sample .",
    "even though we can not do quantitative work with the proper motions , we can still use them in a qualitative way to confirm : _ ( i ) _ the truncation of the wd lf , _ ( ii ) _ the observed shape of the end of the wd cs ( as the stars having proper motions are also the ones with the best photometry ) , and _ ( iii ) _ the goodness of the employed isochrones ( how well they reproduce the blue - turn ) .",

    "stars for which it was possible to estimate a proper motion are highlighted with open circles .",
    "only members along the ms were used to define the transformations between the two epochs , and they are marked in blue . in the second panel ,",
    "we show for this sub - sample of stars the magnitudes of the proper motions vs.  @xmath14 .",
    "cluster members should have a dispersion of the order of @xmath31 km s@xmath61 , which at a distance of @xmath32.4kpc would correspond to a proper motion internal dispersion of less than 0.1masyr@xmath61 , making them an ideal almost - fixed reference frame .",
    "for this reason our zeroes of the motion will coincide with the cluster bulk motion .",
    "it can be seen that at high - signal - to - noise ratio , cluster stars have a sharp proper motion distribution which is consistent with a few times 0.1masyr@xmath61 , but embedded in the middle of a cloud of field objects , mainly thin disk and thick disk stars [ ngc6819 is at ( _ l , b_)@xmath62(74@xmath63,8@xmath63 ) ] .",
    "note the increasing size of random errors with decreasing signal - to - noise ratio .    in order to separate members from non - members",
    "we used the results of the artificial star test illustrated in ( f@xmath64 and f@xmath65 ) and derive the 1-d @xmath48 as the 68.27th percentile of the added@xmath21recovered positions for each coordinate at different magnitude steps .",
    "the red line marks the 2.5@xmath48 level .",
    "non - members , to the right of the red line , are marked in red . in the third panels from left , using the same symbols , we show the vector - point diagrams ( in mas yr@xmath61 ) for four different magnitude bins ( @xmath23 = 18 - 20.5 , 20.5 - 23 , 23 - 25.5 , and 25.5 - 28 ) .",
    "the cmds that results from the cleaning criterion of the second panel are shown in the rightmost panels of the same figure , using both filters .",
    "no matter how tight the circle is , even at the brightest magnitudes , there will always be field objects that accidentally have the same motions of ngc6819 members .",
    "thankfully , the wds of ngc6819 occupy a low - contamination region of the cmd , were few blue faint stars exist , field wds and blue compact galaxies both being generally significantly fainter ( bedin et al .  2009 ) .",
    "although affected by low completeness , it seems even more clear that the sharp drop at @xmath66 ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) in fig .  [ f2](c ) is real and that the few objects along the continuation of the wd cs at @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) are most likely field wds or background unresolved galaxies .    finally , in fig .  [ wdcln ]",
    "we show the cmds of the decontaminated wd cs .",
    "although very incomplete , these contain the best measured wds in our sample , offering a higher - photometric - precision version of the complete sample used to derive the wd lf .",
    "indeed , the shape of the observed blue - turn here appears to be significant , and most importantly consistent with the shape of the wd da isochrones ( indicated in red ) and with the synthetic cmds for the reference lf of panel b ) in fig .",

    "the observed cmds exhibit a very similar feature located at the same magnitude and colour , hinting at the presence of a small fraction of unresolved wd+wd systems , as suggested also by the fit of the lf ( see section  3 ) .",
