    "<S> it was pointed out @xcite that the available experimental values of @xmath142 scale as @xmath143 for a variety of dot sizes and dwell times @xmath108 varying by @xmath144 decades . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ tphi ] ) remains of order one .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the phenomenological definition of @xmath130 is identical to that used before in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where we also demonstrated that for an arbitrary array of quantum dots our expression for the weak localization correction determines the system magnetoconductance if we substitute @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the electron dephasing time due to the external magnetic field @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our definition of @xmath130 is fully consistent with the standard procedure of extracting the electron dephasing time from the magnetoconductance curves . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is straightforward to demonstrate @xcite that , e.g. , in the case of quasi-1d arrays of quantum dots our definition for @xmath130 just yields the standard result for the magnetoconductance of a diffusive wire , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 60 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also would like to emphasize that there exists no contradiction between the definition of @xmath130 adopted here and the fact that no dephasing occurs for electon paths confined within a single quantum dot , as discussed in the beginning of our manuscript . </S>",
    "<S> as it was demonstrated , electron dephasing occurs as soon as time - reversed paths cross the central barrier twice and return to the initial point inside the dot ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . in the presence of fluctuating electromagnetic potentials ( dropping across the central barrier ) the forward path and </S>",
    "<S> its time - reversed counterpart pick up different random phases . after averaging over both fluctuating fields and electron paths </S>",
    "<S> one arrives at a decaying in time contribution to the cooperons which is just captured by our phenomenological definition . </S>",
    "<S> of course , other definitions of @xmath130 can also be employed . </S>",
    "<S> however , our basic conclusion about non - vanishing electron dephasing by electron - electron interactions down to @xmath149 will not be sensitive to any particular definition of @xmath130 , since this conclusion is based on the result ( [ gwlf ] ) demonstrating the interaction - induced suppression of the wl correction to conductance ( as well as of the magnetoconductance , cf . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) at any temperature including @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the basic physics behind this result is exactly the same as that already elucidated by the well known @xmath83-theory @xcite : tunneling electrons can exchange energies with an effective electromagnetic environment . </S>",
    "<S> this process results in broadening of the distribution function for such electrons even at @xmath0 which inevitably yields electron dephasing .    finally , it is instructive to establish the relation to the ordinary perturbation theory in the interaction which is reproduced by formally expanding our exact result ( [ iwl1 ] ) to the first order in @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath150 where @xmath151 , \\label{wlf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath152 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ , i\\,{\\rm im}\\ , z(\\omega)\\ ; c_l(\\omega)c_r(\\omega ) \\big\\}. \\label{wlk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we defined the function @xmath153 and fourier transformed cooperons @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> the two terms @xmath155 and @xmath156 are linear in respectively @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> exactly the same results ( [ pert])-([wlk ] ) are reproduced from the first order diagrammatic perturbation theory in the interaction . in order to observe the equivalence of the two approaches one should keep in mind that @xmath81 is proportional to the keldysh component of the photon green function , while @xmath82 is proportional to the retarded photon green function . </S>",
    "<S> one should also remember that the photon green function in our model is coordinate independent in both quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> one can actually demonstrate that the terms @xmath157 @xmath158 come from the so - called `` self - energy '' diagrams , while the terms @xmath159 emerge from the `` vertex '' diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath156 represents the coulomb blockade correction to @xmath160 and is entirely different from the dephasing term @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the latter , the term @xmath156 is non - linear in @xmath68 describing the standard coulomb offset at large @xmath68 and turning into @xmath161 for @xmath162 in the linear in @xmath68 regime . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the coulomb blockade correction remains small @xcite in the metallic limit @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that @xmath156 involves the combination @xmath164 which enters _ only _ in the first order in the interaction . as in the case of </S>",
    "<S> spatially extended conductors , at @xmath0 some terms contained in @xmath165 partially cancel similar contributions to @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> this cancellation , however , remains incomplete and , as demonstrated by our exact result , by no means implies the absence of electron dephasing at @xmath167 . </S>",
    "<S> more information on the debates on low temperature decoherence by electron - electron interactions can be obtained , e.g. , from refs . @xcite and further references therein . without going into details , we would only like to emphasize that our present manuscript does not make any use of the techniques introduced in our previous works on decoherence in disordered conductors and , </S>",
    "<S> hence , is formally independent on those .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have non - perturbatively treated the effect of electron - electron interactions on weak localization in relatively short metallic conductors . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant effect of interactions is electron decoherence which persists down to @xmath0 and  in agreement with experiments @xcite  yields saturation of @xmath141 at @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this effect is exactly the same as that discussed , e.g. , within the well known @xmath83-theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth pointing out that very recently @xcite we generalized our present approach to arbitrary arrays of quantum dots and derived the expression for @xmath168 which describes both weakly and strongly disordered conductors and quantitatively explains numerous experimental data available to date . in the case of weakly disordered conductors our results </S>",
