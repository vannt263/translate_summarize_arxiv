    "if the gas is in collisional ionizational equilibrium ( cie ) , then the diffuse o  ions and their 1032 , 1038   resonance line emission trace @xmath17  k gas , while the diffuse 1/4 kev and 3/4 kev soft x - rays trace @xmath18 to @xmath19  k gas @xcite .",
    "it is natural to anticipate that the o  -rich and 1/4 kev emitting plasmas are causally , and perhaps physically , associated because million degree gas eventually cools into the 300,000 k regime .",
    "as it cools , its o  ions recombine with electrons to make o  ions . furthermore ,",
    "as time goes by , interfaces between @xmath18  k gas and warm ionized gas ( @xmath20  k ) should develop at temperatures that are between these two values and exhibit intermediate levels of ionization . thus , it is reasonable to expect the 1/4  kev emitting gas to be clad in an o  -rich sheath , irrespective of whether the hot extraplanar gas is due to fountains , superbubbles , or extraplanar supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "such bubble - sheath geometries are present in the disk simulations of @xcite , as are @xmath21  k bubbles without @xmath22  k cores .    in this paper , we focus on hot gas above the galactic disk .",
    "even though the nearest part of this region may be only a few hundred parsecs above the midplane , we will follow the x - ray community s tradition by referring to this region as the halo .",
    "there are a number of fundamental issues that we plan to address about the character of the material that creates o  and x - ray emissions : 1 . )",
    "are the source structures in the halo young , middle aged , or ancient ? 2 . )",
    "what is the temperature distribution function of this gas ? and 3 .",
    ") how long is this plasma s cooling timescale and how does the energy loss rate compare with the rate of energy injection from supernova explosions in both the disk and halo ?",
    "our analyses are based on sets of _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) o  and _ roentgen satellite _ ( _ rosat _ ) 1/4 kev emission data for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we focus much of our attention on the o vi emission data , which can be compared to the soft x - ray emission to synthesize a long baseline spectrum . in turn",
    ", this spectrum defines the shape of the plasma s temperature distribution function and can be compared with models of supernova remnant ( snr ) evolution to constrain the age of a remnant , on the assumption that the hot gas in our line of sight is dominated by the products of one such remnant .",
    "we have no direct measurement of the o  column density along our line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , observations of o  absorption features toward bright extragalactic sources at only moderate angular separations from our direction give an approximate guide on the value of the o  column density , @xmath25 .",
    "this information is useful , since both o  and soft x - ray emission intensities are equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath5 is the local electron density , @xmath27 is the local density of ions , and @xmath28 is a temperature - dependent emissivity function . in contrast , the o  column density is simply equal to the line of sight integral of the ion density .",
    "the column density integral is not additionally weighted by electron density , and its temperature dependence is simply that due to the changes in the ion fraction . as a result , the ratio of the o  intensity to column density can be used to determine the electron density and from that , the thermal pressure .",
    "every observation of the halo s intensity is contaminated by photons produced elsewhere along the line of sight .",
    "the most obvious non - halo sources are the heliosphere @xcite and the local bubble ( also called the local hot bubble ) , where the latter is an irregularly shaped pocket of x - ray emissive , interstellar gas surrounding the solar neighborhood out to a distance of @xmath15100  pc @xcite .",
    "the combined local bubble and heliospheric emission must be subtracted from that found for observations of the high latitude sky in order to determine the halo s intensity . to accomplish this , we selected two adjacent lines of sight , one that is nearly free of foreground obscuration and another that has a cloud of neutral gas , which blocks the more distant halo emission but not the foreground emission . by evaluating the difference between the two intensities , we can measure the emission that arises only from the halo .",
    "this procedure is called the `` shadowing technique . ''    for our shadowed line of sight , we used the strength of o  emission found along the path to a nearby , opaque filament .",
    "the filament is located @xmath29 pc from the sun @xcite , so is positioned beyond , but not far beyond the local bubble . _ fuse _  has already observed a dense part of the filament at @xmath24 .",
    "the observation yielded a 2@xmath30 upper limit on the o  doublet s intensity , including the systematic uncertainties , of 800 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 @xcite . ignoring the systematic uncertainties and using the @xmath31 statistical uncertainties as error bars leads to a best fit value of @xmath32 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 ( as determined by one of us ( rls ) while preparing the original article ) .",
    "to measure the combined halo and local bubble o  intensity for this paper , we used _ fuse _  to observe an unobscured line of sight only 2@xmath33 from the filament ( @xmath23 ; see figure  [ fig : diras ] ) .",
    "in order to estimate the halo s soft x - ray count rate , we perform a similar shadowing analysis using _ rosat _  data for the same pointing directions .",
    "we also subtract the extragalactic soft x - ray contribution and account for the variation in optical depth with photon energy . by carefully isolating the halo emission",
    ", we expect to circumvent the amalgamation problem seen in plots of total o  intensity versus total soft x - ray countrate .",
    "in section  [ sect : observations ] of this paper we present our measurements of the o  emission produced along the unobscured , off - filament line of sight . in subsection",
    "[ subsect : oviintensity ] , we subtract the local o  intensity from our measurement of the unobscured line of sight , yielding the intensity originating in the halo .",
    "we determine the halo s o  column density from published data for nearby directions in subsection  [ novi_estimate ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsect : xraybrightness ] , we estimate of the halo s 1/4  kev surface brightness by performing a shadowing analysis with _ rosat _  data from the filament and off - filament directions .",
    "we then use the halo s o  intensity and column density determinations and treat the o  -rich gas as if it is isothermal in order to estimate the density and pressure of the emitting material in subsection  [ subsect : physicalproperties ] .",
    "we compare the o  and 1/4  kev results with simulation predictions in order to estimate the plasma s maturity in subsections  [ subsect : halosnr ] .",
    "we compare the o  and 1/4  kev results with analytic functions in order to estimate the plasma s temperature distribution function , pressure , and cooling rate in subsection  [ temp_dist ] .",

    "these observations exposed the lif 1a detector segment , the segment used for the subsequent o  signal extraction , for 53 , 104 , and 61  ksec , respectively .",
    "of these durations , 6 , 61 , and 26  ksec , respectively , occurred while the satellite was in the night portion of its orbit . _ fuse _  also made a non - proprietary `` early release observation '' of this direction in december 1999 and archived the data under program identification number x0270301 .",
    "however , detector 1 was de - powered during most of the observation time .      during most of the guest observer exposures ,",
    "data were taken on all four detector segments ( 1a , 1b , 2a , and 2b ) .",
    "the data from each detector segment were taken in time - tag mode where the photoevents from each detector are listed in the sequence that they were recorded , with their times and locations on the detectors where they were found .",
    "we concatenated the photon lists obtained from the individual exposures , creating lists for each detector segment and observation .",
    "we then ran the concatenated photon lists through version 3.1.1 of the calfuse pipeline @xcite , with corrections enabling us to use the extended source extraction window .",
    "we did not use automatic background subtraction . for the lif 1a extractions , we set the lower and upper pulse height limits to 4 and 25 , respectively . for the other detector segments",
    ", we used the default pulse height limits .",
    "this process yielded several spectra , because in addition to recording emission with four detector segments , _ fuse _  records light reflected off of each of two types of coatings ( lithium fluoride ( henceforth called lif ) and silicon carbide ( henceforth called sic ) ) and four gratings .",
    "the multiplicity enables the telescope to see eight overlapping wavelength regimes with various efficiencies .",
    "furthermore , each mirror s focal plane assembly has four apertures .",
    "thus , each detector segment is able to receive light from each of the four apertures simultaneously and without overlap .",
    "the spectra observed through the largest aperture ( lwrs : 30  @xmath37 30  ) in the lif1a channel provides the greatest signal to noise and the greatest effective area in the 1030 to 1040   regime .",
    "we will use these spectra for the following o  data reduction , and will use the spectra from the other channels when searching for other cosmic emission lines outside of the 1030 to 1040   bandpass .",
    "our avoidance of the sic channels overcomes the solar o  line contamination problem discussed by @xcite .",
    "the wavelength scales for each spectrum require re - calibration , which we determined by comparing the reported heliocentric wavelengths of the observed geocoronal emission lines around 1027 and 1040 with their rest wavelengths @xcite converted from the geocentric to the heliocentric reference frame .",
    "we fit a linear function of wavelength to the difference between the expected and observed heliocentric wavelengths , then subtracted this function from the observed wavelengths .",
    "we then combined like spectra and shifted to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] displays the satellite - night and day@xmath38night lif 1a spectra for wavelengths between 1027 and 1045  .",
    "the spectra reveal o  emission in the 1032 and 1038    lines ( rest wavelengths : 1031.93 and 1037.62  ) and c  @xmath39  emission at 1037     ( rest wavelength : 1037.02  ) .",
    "an additional emission feature appears in the day+night spectrum at 1031  , but does not appear in the night - only spectrum .",
    "it also appears in other long - duration _ fuse _  daytime spectra but not in their nighttime counterparts .",
    "we suspect that the 1031  feature is the second order diffraction peak associated with atmospheric he  , whose rest wavelength is 515.62   .",
    "other he  second order lines in our bandpass include @xmath40    and @xmath41   , both of which appear in our daytime spectrum but not our nighttime spectrum . along with the emission lines",
    "is also a continuum , which arises from radioactive decay within the detector , high energy particles , and scattered terrestrial airglow photons .",
    "the last of these is strongest during the daytime portion of the orbit .",
    "we used two methods to measure the strengths of the interstellar emission features . with the first method , which parallels that of @xcite",
    ", we fit a second order polynomial to the continuum of the counts spectrum .",
    "( note that `` counts '' are called `` weights '' in calfuse version 3.1 output files . )",
    "we then subtracted the continuum from the spectrum and searched for wavelength regions with large numbers of counts . due to continuum subtraction and statistical variation ,",
    "a few of the pixels within weak emission features have negative numbers of counts and some pixels outside of the emission features have positive numbers of counts .",
    "although this noise complicated our effort to determine the boundaries of emission features , we set the boundaries of the emission features so as to exclude neighboring regions exhibiting near random fluctuations .",
    "we then summed the residual counts in each emission feature , divided by the instrumental effective area , and incorporated geometric factors in order to convert the measurements to units of intensity .",
    "each measurement s statistical uncertainty was calculated from the square root of the number of counts in the original spectra between the upper and lower wavelength range of the feature .    in the day@xmath38night spectrum ,",
    "the o  1032    emission line and the daytime 1031   feature are too close together to be separated with this algorithm .",
    "therefore , when we analyzed the 1032     emission line in the day@xmath38night data , we used the wavelength range found from the nighttime data ( 1031.64   to 1032.45  ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , the lower end of this range overlaps very little with the he  feature .",
    "furthermore , the measured intensity in the day@xmath38night 1032   o  feature is less than that of the night time feature , leading us to believe that little or no he  emission was attributed to the day@xmath38night 1032   feature .",
    "table  [ table : intensityresults ] lists the measured intensities and 1 sigma statistical uncertainties of the o  1032 and 1038   lines , the c  @xmath39  line , and the anomalous 1031   feature . for presentation purposes",
    ", we round the intensities as well as the local bubble intensity in ",
    "[ subsect : oviintensity ] to 10s of photons sec @xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 .",
    "we use the unrounded values when calculating resulting quantities . given the uncertainties in aperture size and flux calibrations , additional systematic uncertainties of @xmath42 are expected @xcite .",
    "placement of the continuum is another source of uncertainty .",
    "since the continuum was independently determined during each analysis , the variation within our set of measurements provides an estimate of the size of this uncertainty .",
    "the standard deviation among the 4 measurements of the 1032   emission line ( table  [ table : intensityresults ] ) is 220 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 while the standard deviation for the 1038   line is 470 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 .",
    "in order to determine the central wavelengths of our irregular , weak emission features , we fit each residual spectrum with a gaussian and a quadratic . generally , the fitting routine modeled the emission line with the gaussian and the residual background with the quadratic .",
    "occasionally , as occurred in the o  1032    fits , the gaussian extended beyond the bulk of the emission line in order to include nearby weak residual background emission .",
    "thus , the reported wavelengths for the day@xmath38night o  1032    gaussian fit and the nighttime o  1038    gaussian fit are higher and lower , respectively , than one would estimate by eye .",
    "see table  [ table : velocityresults ] for the tabulated results and note that the corrected _ fuse _  scale is accurate to only @xmath43 km sec@xmath3 .    in the second method , which parallels that of @xcite",
    ", we fit the intensity spectrum s continuum with a straight line and its emission features with gaussian shapes that had been convolved with a 106 km sec@xmath3 top - hat function ( simulating the finite width of the lwrs aperture ) . because the o  1032     emission line and the daytime 1031    emission feature are so close together in the day@xmath38night spectrum , they were fit simultaneously . the o  1038     emission line and the c  @xmath39   emission line required simultaneous fitting for the same reason .",
    "the fits occasionally included outlying emission , which shifted the reported centroid wavelengths and increased the areas under the curves .",
    "the @xmath44 error bars for each model parameter were determined as described in @xcite .",
    "see tables  [ table : intensityresults ] and [ table : velocityresults ] for the measured intensities and velocities .",
    "the o  and c  @xmath39  appear to be moving very slowly relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "however , the 1032   signal is offset by about 30 km s@xmath3 from the 1038   signal , even in the fits that were not corrupted by outlying emission , the night - only 1032   and the day+night 1038   fits .",
    "the difference may be due to inaccuracies in the wavelength scale , being as the observed difference is somewhat more than twice the uncertainty in the velocity of each feature .",
    "it could also be due to variations in self - absorption optical depth as a function of wavelength .",
    "larger differences have been seen in other spectra , for example the virgo and coma spectra of @xcite . in the night",
    "- only 1032   and the day+night 1038   fits , the @xmath30 of the cosmic emission lines gaussian profiles were 47 and 39  km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the resulting full widths at half maximum are 111 and 92 km  s@xmath3 , respectively , while the doppler parameters are 65 and 55  km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the true widths of the cosmic emission lines should be slightly narrower than these values because the fitting method accounts for only the broadening due to a finite slit width and not any other form of instrumental broadening .    as a result of applying two analysis methods to two dataset variants ( the day @xmath38 night data and the night only data )",
    ", we have 4 measurements for each of the o  1032  , o  1038  , and c  @xmath39  1037   emission lines . for the most part , the @xmath45 measurements overlap .",
    "however , for each cosmic line , 3 of the 4 intensity measurements are similar to each other while the 4th measurement is an outlier . from the 3 clustered and unrounded measurements , we calculate average intensities of the o  1032    line , 1038    line , and the c  @xmath39  line .",
    "they are 3190@xmath46450@xmath47350 , and 1600@xmath46330 photons sec@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "our o  signals are neither especially bright nor especially dim when compared with the mid latitude ( @xmath48 ) _ fuse _  detections in the @xcite and @xcite survey .",
    "the larger of these compilations , that of @xcite , lists 17 sight lines having 2 @xmath30 and 3 @xmath30 detections of moderate velocity ( -100 km s@xmath3 @xmath49 100 km s@xmath3 ) o  1032   emission . of these 17 signals ,",
    "10 were brighter and 7 were dimmer than our 1032   signal .",
    "we also examined the data for signs of other cosmic emission lines .",
    "no significant signals were found .",
    "our search for c  emission at 977.02   in the satellite - night sic 1b spectrum yielded an intensity @xmath50 of 1300 @xmath46 1740 photons sec@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 .",
    "similarly , our search for n  emission at 916.71    in the same spectrum yielded 510 @xmath46 1250 photons sec@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 .",
    "although neither species is observed in our dataset , both are observed at the @xmath51 level in the on - filament observation ( c  : 4700 @xmath46 1300 and 2600 @xmath46 1000 photons sec@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 in the nighttime sic 1b and sic 2a spectra , respectively ; n  : 2300 @xmath46 1100 photons sec@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 in the night time sic 1b spectrum , @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the observed photons came from the filament itself .",
    "though , if this is the case , then the c  intensity is remarkably bright , considering that theoretical predictions for evaporating clouds @xcite , predict an order of magnitude dimmer emission .      along our line of sight , the combined intensity arising from both members of the o  doublet is 4710 @xmath46 570 photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "the observed intensity can be apportioned between the local bubble ( plus heliospheric ) and ` halo ' components if we assume that the local emission is approximately constant over small angular separations .",
    "the observation of an opaque filament on a nearby direction , @xmath52 , set upper limits on the local o  intensity @xcite .",
    "for the local contribution , we take the tightest 1 @xmath30 upper limit ( due to random variation only ) on the doublet from the day@xmath38night data for the 1032   emission line and the assumption that the 1038   line is half as strong as the 1032   line .",
    "this doublet intensity is @xmath53 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 . however , since the local bubble can not produce negative photons , we adjust the estimated intensity arising within 230 @xmath46 30  pc of the earth ( thus within 160 @xmath46 20  pc of the galactic plane ) to @xmath54 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 . thus , for our sight line , the remainder and vast majority of the observed intensity ( @xmath1 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 ) is produced in the halo .",
    "note that the filament data were later included in the @xcite catalog . to understand the @xcite reanalysis",
    ", the reader needs to first know that the filament was observed in 5 sets of grouped lwrs exposures , taken over a 2 year period , towards 3 very similar directions on the sky ( ( @xmath55 ) , ( @xmath56 ) , and ( @xmath57 ) ) .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite shows that all three directions point toward a dense knot in an infrared - bright filament .",
    "@xcite separately plotted the spectra for each of the three directions , found no important systematic differences between the spectra , then added the spectra and searched for emission in the o  1032 and 1038   lines .",
    "no emission was found near the milky way s local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity in either line , in either the data taken during the satellite night portion of the orbit or data taken during the the satellite day + night portions of the orbit . in our shadowing analysis ( previous paragraph ) , we have adopted the tightest @xmath31 upper limit for the doublet , excluding systematic uncertainties , from the @xcite analysis .",
    "it was derived from the day+night data for the o  1032   region .",
    "the later analysis by @xcite differed from that of @xcite because it included only data taken during orbital night , searched for only the 1032   emission line , and used a different version of the pipeline , different choices of pulse height cutoffs , and a different spectral fitting algorithm .",
    "they noticed a high velocity feature in their combined dataset , but determined that it was primarily associated with their data taken towards @xmath56 . in that direction , their o  1032   feature s velocity and intensity are @xmath58 km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath59 photons",
    "@xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , neither of their spectra in the other directions revealed statistically significant o  1032   emission .",
    "from this , @xcite concluded that o  in the magellanic stream moving at @xmath60  km  s@xmath3 relative to the lsr had been viewed through a previously unknown hole in the filament and that the other observations viewed opaque portions of the filament .",
    "when @xcite excluded the red - shifted feature from their analysis of the combined dataset , they derived a @xmath61 upper limit on the o  1032   emission of @xmath62 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 ( see the last paragraph of their appendix a.2 and note that their naming convention differs from that of @xcite ) , which is roughly similar to the @xmath61 upper limit reported by @xcite .",
    "given that they did not find lsr rest frame emission , they did not modify the conclusions of @xcite regarding the physical conditions in the local bubble .    if the high velocity o   reported by @xcite were to lie along the off - filament line of sight analyzed in this paper , then its 1032   emission would be @xmath63 as bright as and 0.6    longwards of the o  1032   feature we observed . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , our spectra are dim around @xmath64   , the wavelength of o  traveling at 206  km  s@xmath3 . our wavelength calibration in this part of the spectrum is good to within @xmath150.034    ( @xmath1510  km  s@xmath3 ) ; therefore , the observed velocity of the o  1032   feature in our spectrum is inconsistent with the reported velocity of the @xcite feature .",
    "thus , we conclude that the high velocity , presumably extra - galactic feature seen by @xcite in the i2050501 + i2050510 data has not appeared in the off - filament data and does not affect our analysis of the halo s emission .",
    "next we consider the effects of extinction .",
    "our off - filament line of sight is only mildly extincted , but we obtain somewhat different results from different datasets . according to the _ dirbe _ and _ iras _ data @xcite , its color excess is e(b - v ) = 0.0217 , implying that @xmath65 if we use the empirical relation @xmath66 derived by @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that 25@xmath16 of the photons originating beyond the obscuring material have been extincted @xcite . however , according to the leiden - argentine - bonn survey @xcite , the column density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath67 , is @xmath68  @xmath2 on the two nearest lines of sight ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , equating to a color excess of 0.0414 @xcite and an extinction loss of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we recognize that this may slightly overestimate the amount of hydrogen along our line of sight because some small portion of the @xmath72 ( hpbw ) diameter beam could be responding to the emission from the filament .",
    "we will take @xmath73  @xmath2 as the upper end of the possible range .    for a lower limit to the absorption",
    ", we consider the extreme case that a large fraction of the neutral hydrogen might be beyond the o  -emitting gas ( almost all of which must be more distant than the shadowing filament ) . a limit to that fraction",
    "is defined by an estimate for the amount of h  i that exists within the local bubble .",

    "irrespective of whether the energetic events occurred above the galactic disk ( i.e. extraplanar supernova explosions and collisions between infalling clouds and the milky way ) or in the disk and the hot gas later rose into the halo , we expect the plasma to evolve from a recently shock heated and underionized state to a tepid and overionized state ; and we expect the observationally determined o  to soft x - ray ratio to be a useful diagnostic . in the following halo snr simulations , we found that the ratio of o  to 1/4 kev emission rises almost monotonically throughout the remnant s life , making it a diagnostic of the remnant s maturity .",
    "we calculated the ratio of o  to _ rosat _  1/4  kev intensities from a simulated , extraplanar supernova remnant .",

    ", we describe the plasma s evolution and the consequent o  to x - ray ratio s evolution . when the halo supernova remnant is very young ( age @xmath170 10,000 yrs ) , its most emissive portion is the hot , dense gas immediately behind the shock front . due to the rapid ionizations , the recently shock - heated gas in this zone contains o  and higher ions .",
    "although this plasma emits both o  resonance line and soft x - ray photons , its temperature ( @xmath171  k ) is far too high for optimum o  resonance line emission . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of o  to soft x - ray intensities is less than the observed ratio ( see figure  [ fig : snrratio ] ) .",
    "as time passes , the shock front slows , thus heating the gas in and just behind the shock to lesser temperatures and leading to a slight increase in the o  to x - ray ratio .",
    "before the remnant is @xmath172 years old , both the hot dense gas near the shock front and the hot rarefied gas in its interior are drastically out of cie .",
    "when the remnant is between 50,000 and 100,000  years old , most of its plasma comes into cie , but not in the usual manner . rather than maturing sufficiently for its ionization levels to come into equilibrium with the gas temperature ,",

    "its atoms begin to recombine .",
    "when the remnant is between 100,000 and 250,000  years , its shock front becomes too cool to produce much o   or soft x - ray emission .",

    "we move on to a more generalized picture and propose that the hot gas in the halo of our galaxy is a heterogeneous mixture of regions having plasmas at different temperatures , created possibly by many sn events whose influences on the halo medium have merged together .",

    "the internal densities @xmath237 within each clump , which in our model can reach as high as @xmath238 , is about two orders of magnitude higher than an overall average @xmath239 that was found in a _ fuse _   survey of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the column density of electrons along our line of sight is given by @xmath240 and we list outcomes for the appropriate values of @xmath187 and @xmath67 in table  [ pwr_law_parameters ] .",
    "in  [ subsect : abundances ] we discussed the possibility that the abundance of oxygen might be higher than the one that we adopted from @xcite . if we were to adopt the old , higher abundance value given by @xcite ( larger by 0.27  dex ) , the values of @xmath187 listed in table  [ pwr_law_parameters ] would increase by about 0.5 because the relative proportion of the plasma at temperatures that emit o  line radiation is reduced , when compared to the higher temperature material that emits soft x - rays .",
    "( recall that the predicted x - ray emission is not strongly influenced by changes in the abundance of oxygen , as we stated in an earlier footnote . ) for the three values of foreground @xmath241(h  i ) , ( 0.5 , 1.0 , @xmath242 ) , the old oxygen abundance changes @xmath243 by ( + 0.03 , + 0.03 , + 0.05 )  dex , respectively .",
    "values of @xmath229 change by ( + 0.23 , + 0.09 , + 0.17 )  dex , while @xmath244 changes by ( + 0.05 , + 0.01 , + 0.03 )  dex .      here",
    ", we assume that the observed line of sight provides a fair representation of the halo as a whole .",
    "this assumption allows us to calculate the total radiative energy loss rate associated with hot gas in the halo , a rate that can be usefully compared with the energy injection rate .    to compute the radiative energy loss rate from the hot gas in the halo ,",
    "we must know how the differential emission measure @xmath245 varies with temperature . with our reformulation of @xmath181 in terms of @xmath182",
    "we find that @xmath246 along our line of sight .",
    "the second to the last group of numbers in table  [ pwr_law_parameters ] shows the logarithms of the coefficient in front of the @xmath247 term in the equation .    with our expression for the emission measure as a function of @xmath142",
    ", we are now prepared to estimate the power radiated by the gas at temperatures above @xmath179k . for a cooling function",
    "@xmath248 that is normalized to the local product of electron and ion densities @xmath249 , we adopt the values listed by @xcite that apply to a plasma that has a solar composition and nonequilibrium ion fractions in a regime of radiative , isochoric cooling , starting with an initial temperature of @xmath250k . if we were to suppose that our line of sight shows a fair representation of the cooling per unit area @xmath251 by hot gas on both sides of the galactic plane in our region of the galaxy , we find that @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the galactic latitude of our line of sight ( @xmath254 ) , the factor 2 accounts for both sides of the plane , and the factor 0.917 allows for the fact that our expression for @xmath255 is cast in terms of @xmath256 whereas the normalization of the function expressed by @xcite is normalized to @xmath249 .",
    "values of @xmath257 are listed in the last group of numbers in table  [ pwr_law_parameters ] .",
    "several important qualifications must be expressed about these numbers .",
    "first , we have truncated the calculation at a lower limit @xmath258k because we have no ability to sense gas at lower temperatures .",
    "if an extrapolation of our power - law representation seems plausible , we should expect to find some additional energy radiated below @xmath179k .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ plt3 ] , where we have plotted the shape of the integrand in eq .",
    "[ dedt ] as a function of @xmath259 .",
    "second , @xcite used the solar abundances given by @xcite instead of the more modern values of @xcite that we adopted .",
    "thus , if the function @xmath248 were to be recalculated using the newer abundances , we would find a somewhat lower cooling rate , but by a factor that is less severe than the changes in the c , n and o abundances , since other elements are also important coolants .",
    "if indeed the older abundances are correct , the ripple effect from the changes in the parameters derived in  [ temp_dist ] above could reduce the emission power by up to -0.4  dex . aside from these possible offsets",
    ", our determination should be free of bias , and indeed the values of o  and x - ray emission found here are fairly typical of those found along other high latitude sight lines .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that the distribution of hot gas in the galactic halo is extremely uneven ; hence our single line of sight does not give a very accurate representation of the average @xmath260 on either side of the galactic plane .",
    "the rate of cooling , @xmath251 , is similar to the rate of energy input from supernova explosions and pre - supernova winds .",
    "the average massive sn progenitor star releases @xmath261 to @xmath262  ergs in wind energy before it explodes , according to calculations in @xcite and @xcite . at the sun s galactocentric radius , 18.6 massive stars and 2.6 white dwarfs explode per myr per kpc@xmath263 cross - sectional disk area , though many of these stars explode above the disk @xcite .",
    "if each explosion releases @xmath264  ergs of energy , then sn and pre - sn winds inject @xmath265 to @xmath266 erg kpc@xmath132 s@xmath3 into the ism .",
    "a comparison with the calculated energy loss rate for our nominal case ( @xmath267 erg kpc@xmath132 s@xmath3 ) shows that the majority of the injected sn and pre - sn energy is later radiated away by hot halo gas . since the halo cooling rate accounts for @xmath268 of the sn and pre - sn wind energy injection rate , little remains to power other activities , such as large scale galactic winds .",
    "half of the photons emitted by the halo will travel toward the galactic midplane and likely be absorbed , while the other half will travel upwards .",
    "their absorption rate depends on the column density of gas residing above the emitting gas , which is expected to be less than @xmath269  @xmath270 .",
    "thus , most of the 1032   and shorter photons will leave the system .",
    "we analyzed _ fuse _  lwrs data for @xmath271 , finding an o  doublet intensity of 4710 @xmath46 570 photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "our pointing direction is only mildly extincted , so the observed intensity included contributions from the local bubble and the galactic halo . only @xmath272 from our pointing direction , the sky is heavily extincted by a filament residing 230 pc from the earth .",
    "a previous observation of that direction indicated the local bubble s contribution .",
    "the difference between the intensities observed on these two sight lines , @xmath1 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , can be attributed to the halo .",
    "given the extinction along our line of sight due to an @xmath273 of 0.5 to @xmath75  @xmath2 , the halo s intrinsic intensity is @xmath274 to @xmath94 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 sr@xmath3 .",
    "we estimated the halo s o  column density from absorption lines seen in the uv spectra of extragalactic objects .",
    "we averaged values toward the 4 nearest sight lines and then subtracted an estimate for the expected contribution from the local bubble .",
    "when we used it and our intrinsic o  intensity range and treated the o  -bearing gas as if it were isothermal , we found that the electron density and thermal pressure in the halo s o  -rich gas are 0.01 to 0.02  @xmath7 and 7000 to 10,000  k  @xmath7 , respectively .    by performing a similar shadowing analysis with the _",
    "rosat_1/4  kev data , we determined the 1/4 kev count rate attributable to the galactic halo along @xmath275 .",
    "it is 732 @xmath46 142 @xmath131 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath132 , before accounting for line of sight extinction . after accounting for extinction ,",
    "the intrinsic r12 countrate is @xmath138 to @xmath139 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath132 .",
    "the o  vs 1/4  kev intensity ratio is 4.7 to 1.1 , depending on whether the emitting gas is beyond @xmath276 or @xmath75  @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus , more energy leaves the system through the o  resonance lines than through the _ rosat _  1/4  kev bandpass .",
    "in contrast , the opposite is true of the local region ( local bubble @xmath38 heliospheric ) , where roughly twice as much energy ( at least ) is radiated by the 1/4  kev emission lines than by the o  resonance line doublet .    in order to estimate the maturity of the emitting plasma , we compared the o  to soft x - ray ratio with predictions for a simulated supernova remnant at various times in its life . around the time that the thermal temperature throughout most of the remnant approached the plasma s collisional ionizational equilibrium temperature ,",
    "the spectrum produced a 4.7 to 1 ratio , coincident with the observational ratio assuming minimal extinction .",
    "earlier in its life , the simulated remnant had produced a 1.1 to 1 ratio , coincident with the observational ratio assuming mild extinction .",
    "specifically , these ratios were achieved when the snr was 70,000 and 40,000 years old , respectively .",
    "we suggest that other possible hot gas structures would be similarly mature when they , too , produce a similar o  to soft x - ray intensity ratio .    using the o  to soft x - ray ratio ,",
    "we were also able to parameterize the hot halo plasma with a power law temperature distribution ( @xmath277 ) . given the nominal estimates of foreground absorption ( @xmath77 @xmath2 ) and o  column density ( @xmath278 @xmath2 ) along our line of sight , we found @xmath279 , @xmath280 k , and @xmath281 k@xmath282 pc .",
    "hot gas with a temperature between @xmath143 k and @xmath188 occupies @xmath283 pc along our line of sight , but the o  -rich gas occupies a small fraction of this length .",
    "assuming that our line of sight is typical of high latitude sight lines , we found the cooling rate for the halo ( both sides of the plane beyond the local bubble ) per unit cross sectional area to be @xmath284 erg s@xmath3 kpc@xmath132 . at the sun s galactocentric radius , the hot halo s radiative cooling accounts for @xmath268 of the energy injected into the ism from sne and pre - sn winds in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the remaining @xmath285 of the injected energy must be split between all other energy loss processes .",
