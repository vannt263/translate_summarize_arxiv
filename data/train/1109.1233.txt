    "in the past years , the investigation of percolation on various high - dimensional tori has attracted tremendous attention . in @xcite ,",
    "the phase transition of the largest connected component was investigated for percolation on general high - dimensional tori , including the complete graph , the hypercube in high dimensions , as well as finite - range percolation in sufficiently high dimensions .",
    "the phase transition of percolation on high - dimensional tori is _ mean - field _ , i.e. , it shares many features with that on the complete graph as identified in @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "the subcritical and critical behavior was investigated under the so - called _ triangle condition _ , a general assumption on the underlying graph that ensures that the model is mean - field .",
    "the critical behavior of the model was identified in terms of the blow - up of the expected cluster size , which identifies a window of critical values of the edge occupation probabilities . for any parameter value in this critical window ,",
    "the largest connected component was shown to be of order @xmath4 , as on the complete graph , where @xmath5 denotes the number of vertices in the graph . in @xcite ,",
    "the triangle condition was proved to hold for the above - mentioned examples .",
    "the situation of finite - range high - dimensional tori , which in the graph sense converge to the hyper - cubic lattice , was brought substantially further in @xcite , where , among others , it was shown that the percolation critical value on the infinite lattice lies inside the scaling window .",
    "we now know that the largest connected components are all of order @xmath4 , that the maximal connected component @xmath6 satisfies that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are tight sequences of random variables that are non - concentrated , and that the diameter of large clusters is of order @xmath9",
    ". these results ( and more ) are also known to hold on the erds - rnyi random graph , see e.g. , @xcite , as well as the monographs @xcite .",
    "this raises the question whether the scaling limits agree .",
    "we shall expand on this question in section [ sec - dis ] below .",
    "we consider bond percolation on a graph @xmath10 .",
    "for a given parameter @xmath11 $ ] , this is the probability measure @xmath12 on subgraphs of @xmath10 defined as follows .",
    "we delete edges of @xmath10 with probability @xmath13 and otherwise keep them , independently for different edges .",
    "the edges of the resulting random subgraph of @xmath10 are called _ open _ and the deleted edges are called _",
    "closed_. connected components of this random subgraph are called _",
    "open clusters_. the graphs we investigate in this paper are ( a ) the @xmath14-dimensional torus @xmath15 ; and ( b ) the hypercubic lattice @xmath16 , where the dimension @xmath14 is supposed to be sufficiently large .",
    "how large we need to take @xmath14 depends on the edge structure of @xmath10 .",
    "we consider two different settings : ( a ) in the _ nearest - neighbor model _ , two vertices are connected by an edge if they are nearest - neighbors on @xmath10 . with our choice of @xmath10 ,",
    "every vertex has @xmath17 nearest - neighbors . in this",
    "setting we take the dimension @xmath14 large enough .",
    "( b ) in the _ spread - out model _ with a parameter @xmath18 , two vertices are connected by an edge if there is a hypercube of size @xmath18 in @xmath10 that contains these vertices . with our choice of @xmath10 ,",
    "every vertex has @xmath19 neighbors .",
    "of course , we are only interested in the case when the size of the torus is much larger than @xmath18 . in the spread - out setting with large enough @xmath18 , we take the dimension @xmath20 .",
    "to justify our choice of dimension , we recall a number of well - known results about percolation on @xmath21 . for bond percolation on @xmath16 with @xmath22",
    ", there exists a critical probability @xmath23 such that , for @xmath24 , all open clusters are almost surely finite and , for @xmath25 , there is almost surely an infinite open cluster . at @xmath26",
    ", it is widely believed that there is almost surely no infinite open cluster .",
    "this fact has been shown for @xmath27 by kesten @xcite and for sufficiently large @xmath14 by hara and slade @xcite . here , by sufficiently large @xmath14 ,",
    "we mean @xmath28 for the nearest - neighbor model and @xmath20 for the spread - out model with sufficiently large @xmath18 . showing this for all @xmath22 remains a challenging open problem .",
    "the main assumption that we use in the paper concerns an estimate on the probability that , at criticality , two vertices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are in the same open cluster of bond percolation on @xmath21 , which we denote by @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that there exist constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that , for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath21 , @xmath34 these bounds have been established using so - called _ lace - expansion _ techniques , for the nearest - neighbor model with large enough @xmath14 by hara @xcite , and for the spread - out model with @xmath20 by hara , van der hofstad and slade @xcite .",
    "in fact , these papers give asymptotic formulas for such probabilities , but for our purposes , the bounds ( [ prop2pf ] ) suffice .",
    "it is believed that the estimates ( [ prop2pf ] ) hold for the nearest - neighbor model with @xmath20 , however the proof of this fact is beyond the current methods .",
    "it has been proved by chayes and chayes @xcite ( assuming the existence of critical exponents ) that the bounds ( [ prop2pf ] ) are violated for @xmath35 .",
    "the dimension @xmath36 is usually referred to as the _ upper critical dimension_.    a simple computation using the upper bound in ( [ prop2pf ] ) shows that @xmath37 the bound in is called the _ triangle condition _ , and is believed to be true for @xmath20 . the triangle condition implies that the sub- and critical phases of percolation on @xmath16 behave similarly to the ones on a tree , for example , many critical exponents on @xmath16 are equal to those on the tree .",
    "intuitively , the geometry of large critical clusters trivializes , since the space is so vast that far away clusters are close to being independent . in recent years , a related condition has been proved to hold on the torus , which implies that the critical behavior of large connected components on the high - dimensional torus is similar to that on the complete graph .",
    "sometimes this is called _ random graph asymptotics _ for percolation on the high - dimensional torus .    in this paper",
    ", we study the _ cycle structure _ of bond percolation on the @xmath14-dimensional torus in the above two settings . despite the fact that , for any @xmath38 , the vertices in open cycles occupy a positive fraction of the torus , which is not the case for the critical and subcritical erds - rnyi random graph ( see @xcite ) , most of such vertices belong only to _ short _ cycles , such as open squares of four bonds .",
    "short cycles vanish in the scaling limit of large critical clusters , and are thus irrelevant to the scaling limit .",
    "therefore , we focus on the existence of open long cycles , where we say that a cycle is long when it passes through the boundary of the cube of width @xmath1 centered around each of its vertices . special cases of long cycles are _ non - contractible cycles _ , which are cycles that can not , when considered as continuous curves , be contracted to a point , and thus wind around the torus at least once .",
    "our main results show that the mean number of vertices in open long cycles grows like @xmath9 , and that such cycles ( when they exist ) contain order of @xmath9 vertices .",
    "moreover , we show that the probability of the existence of at least one open long cycle in a large cluster is bounded away from 0 and 1 , uniformly in the volume of the graph . as we discuss in more details below , this situation is analogous to the situation on the complete graph , as investigated in @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite for the discussion of more refined results about the structure of connected components of the critical erds - rnyi random graph .    for simplicity of presentation , _ we restrict ourselves hereafter to the nearest - neighbor model_. the results of this paper still hold for the spread - out model on the @xmath14-dimensional torus with @xmath20 .",
    "the remainder of this section is organized as follows . in section [ sec - res ] , we describe our main results , in section [ sec - extra ] , we describe some results on critical percolation on @xmath3 and the torus that are used in the proofs of our main results and are interesting in their own right , and in section [ sec - dis ] , we discuss the results and their relation to the work on the erds - rnyi random graph .",
