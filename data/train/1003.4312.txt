    "after more than 40 years since the seminal ideas coined by a handful of theoretical pioneers@xcite , our present understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) phenomenon through the higgs ( englert - brout and guralnik - hagen - kibble ) mechanism is still rather incomplete and experimentally inconclusive . on the one hand",
    ", there is no compelling alternative to consistently embed the ewsb mechanism into the quantum field theoretical description of particle physics offered by the  in so many regards successful  standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions . on the other hand",
    ", we do not have a single phenomenological hint of the existence of elementary scalar fields , not to mention the fact that we do not understand how to make compatible the ewsb mechanism and its associated vacuum energy with fundamental problems of different scope , for example in the domain of cosmology .",
    "still , the possibility to describe the inner theoretical structure of the sm through the ewsb mechanism is so successful within the restricted particle physics domain that it would not be wise , not even advisable , to cease our pursue of the phenomenological implications of the higgs mechanism paradigm till the limits of the current experimental possibilities .",
    "it goes without saying that the quest for experimental evidences of the higgs boson is a most preeminent milestone of the upcoming generation of collider facilities .",
    "nonetheless , the future data might well reveal that the purportedly found higgs boson actually belongs to a richer model structure , which might be grounded somewhere beyond the minimal conception of the sm , namely of a single , spinless , fundamental constituent of matter .",
    "if so , a few more fundamental spinless constituents could appear .",
    "a particularly well - motivated extension is the two - higgs - doublet model structure encompassed by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite . here the physical higgs boson spectrum contains a couple of @xmath17-even ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , one @xmath17-odd ( @xmath20 ) and two charged higgs bosons ( @xmath21 ) , and the corresponding higgs potential is highly constrained by the underlying supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "one particular consequence of the latter is that susy invariance restricts all higgs boson self - interactions to be gauge - like . while this represents an economy from the point of view of the number of couplings in the potential , it is strongly imbalanced by the exceeding number of parameters ( mixings and masses ) populating the other sectors of the mssm .",
    "in addition , the pure gauge nature of the higgs boson self - couplings make them highly inconspicuous from the practical point of view , in the sense that they are unable to trigger any outstanding phenomenological signature .",
    "the core of the enhancement capabilities of the mssm lagrangian resides , instead , in the multifarious pattern of yukawa couplings between the higgs bosons and the quarks , as well as between quarks , squarks and charginos / neutralinos .",
    "the rich interplay of opportunities that they give rise to has been extensively analyzed in the past within a plethora of processes , see e.g.  @xcite , and also  @xcite for reviews on the subject .",
    "the two - higgs @xmath22-doublet structure of the higgs sector in the mssm constitutes a genuine prediction of the susy dynamics .",
    "nonetheless , a more general architecture can appear in the form of a non - susy framework through the so - called general ( unconstrained ) two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm)-conserving higgs potential .",
    "as usually done in practice@xcite , we impose an additional ( softly - broken ) @xmath23 discrete symmetry @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denote each of the @xmath22 higgs doublets , as a sufficient condition to banish the tree - level flavor changing neutral currents . ] .",
    "although they share a common higgs boson spectrum , the potentially most distinctive phenomenological features of both models are located in very different sectors .",
    "the most relevant observation here is that , in the absence of an underlying susy , the triple ( 3h ) and quartic ( 4h ) higgs - boson self - interactions are no longer restrained to be purely gauge .",
    "this can have a tremendous impact e.g. in the physics of the top quark in hadron colliders , as it was shown long ago in @xcite , and it can also trigger significant neutral flavor - changing interactions@xcite that can perfectly compete with the susy ones@xcite .",
    "much attention has been devoted to higgs boson production and decay in hadron colliders , extending from the ongoing tevatron facility at fermilab to the brand new lhc collider recently operating at cern @xcite .",
    "however , precision higgs boson physics will greatly benefit from the interplay@xcite of the forthcoming generation of linear colliders ( linac ) , such as the ilc and clic projects@xcite . here",
    "a variety of processes can provide new clues to higgs boson physics , e.g. the production of triple higgs - boson final states , both in the mssm @xcite and in the general 2hdm @xcite ; the double higgs - strahlung channels @xmath26 @xcite ; and the inclusive higgs - pair production via gauge - boson fusion@xcite . in the same vein , also",
    "the @xmath27 mode of a linac has been explored@xcite , in particular the loop - induced production of a single neutral higgs boson @xcite and of a higgs boson pair @xcite .",
    "in all the above mentioned cases , promising signatures were singled out and illustrate that , if effectively realized in nature , such hints of a generic 2hdm structure could hardly be missed in the superbly clean environment of a linac . and , what is more , they could not be confused as having a susy origin , because of the intrinsically different nature of the higgs self - interaction sector .",
    "besides , outstanding fingerprints of a generic 2hdm could also be stamped in the pattern of radiative corrections to higgs production processes ; for instance , quantum effects on the cross - sections for two - body higgs boson final states : @xmath28 have been attentively investigated in the mssm @xcite . as for the general 2hdm",
    ", the efforts were first concentrated on the production of charged higgs pairs @xcite .",
    "this program has been recently brought to completion from a full - fledged study of the quantum effects on the production cross - sections in the neutral higgs sector @xcite . alongside these processes",
    "we find the more traditional higgs - strahlung events , in which a higgs boson is produced in association with the @xmath0 : @xmath29 ( notice that the @xmath30 final state is forbidden by @xmath31-conservation . )",
    "processes ( [ eq : hz ] ) are complementary to the ( [ 2h ] ) ones  cf .",
    "@xcite , and also  @xcite for a phenomenological analysis in the mssm context .",
    "let us also recall that the last available limit on the sm higgs boson mass , placed by lep searches , comes precisely from investigating the `` bjorken process''@xcite , i.e. @xmath32 followed by @xmath33 , with the result : @xmath34 gev@xcite . in this article , we aim at discussing the corresponding one - loop corrections to the generalized bjorken processes within the 2hdm .",
    "however , in contrast to the original sm case , where the radiative corrections are small , the quantum effects on the processes ( [ eq : hz ] ) can be large and are mainly driven by the 3h self - couplings .",
    "in fact , our main aim here is to identify the regions of the parameter space where this is so , and then quantify the impact of the potentially enhanced 3h self - couplings on the final cross - sections . in this way , joining this study with that of ref .",
    "@xcite on the pairwise higgs boson production channels ( [ 2h ] ) in the 2hdm , a rather complete panorama of the genuine quantum effects associated to the basic neutral higgs boson production channels becomes available .",
    "a good deal of attention has been devoted in the literature to multiple properties of the higgs - strahlung process @xmath35 in the sm , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "not surprisingly it was one of the gold - plated channels for higgs boson search at lep .",
    "concerning the mssm , the higgs - strahlung channels   have also been discussed extensively  cf .",
    "@xcite and part two of the review  @xcite  and are currently under investigation also in the mssm with @xmath17-violating phases@xcite ( the so - called complex mssm@xcite ) .",
    "the upshot of these analyses spotlights the following features : i ) the dominant source of corrections at one - loop originate from the higgs boson propagators , which can be reabsorbed into an _ effective _ ( loop - corrected ) mixing angle @xmath36 ( equivalently , a more generic mixing matrix in the complex mssm case ) ; ii ) the corrections to the @xmath37 vertex are in general small ,",
    "although they can reach the level of @xmath38 for very low ( or high ) values of @xmath39 , precisely in the regions where the higgs yukawa couplings to heavy quarks become enhanced ; iii ) the electromagnetic corrections to the initial state with virtual photonic corrections and initial - state radiation do not differ from the sm case , being in general large and positive ( except near the production threshold ) . in the present article ,",
    "our endeavor is to seek for the genuine phenomenological imprints associated to the generic ( unconstrained ) 2hdm dynamics , most particularly to the potentially enhanced 3h self - couplings .",
    "let us recall that the general 2hdm@xcite is obtained by canonically extending the sm higgs sector with a second @xmath22 doublet with weak hypercharge @xmath40 , so that it contains @xmath41 complex scalar fields .",
    "the free parameters @xmath42 in the general , @xmath17-conserving , 2hdm potential can be finally expressed in terms of the masses of the physical higgs particles ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 ( the ratio of the two vev s @xmath48 giving masses to the up- and down - like quarks ) , the mixing angle @xmath49 between the two @xmath31-even states and , last but not least , the self - coupling @xmath9 , which can not be absorbed in the previous quantities . therefore we end up with a @xmath50-free parameter set , to wit : @xmath51 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath39 , @xmath54 . furthermore , to ensure the absence of tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , two main 2hdm scenarios arise : 1 ) type - i 2hdm , in which one higgs doublet couples to all quarks , whereas the other doublet does not couple to them at all ; 2 ) type - ii 2hdm , where one doublet couples only to down - like quarks and the other doublet to up - like quarks .",
    "the mssm higgs sector is actually a type - ii one , but of a very restricted sort ( enforced by susy invariance)@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive account on the structure of the model and for notational details . in particular ,",
    "table ii of that reference includes the full list of trilinear couplings within the general 2hdm that are relevant for the present calculation .",
    "further constraints must be imposed to assess that the sm behavior is sufficiently well reproduced up to the energies explored so far .",
    "most particularly , we take into account i ) the approximate @xmath55 custodial symmetry , which can be reshuffled into the condition @xmath56@xcite ; and @xmath57 the agreement with the low - energy radiative @xmath58-meson decay data ( which demand @xmath59 gev for @xmath60 @xcite in the case of type - ii 2hdm ) .",
    "additional requirements ensue from the theoretical consistency of the model , to wit i ) perturbativity  @xcite ; ii ) unitarity  @xcite ; and iii ) stability of the 2hdm vacuum  @xcite .",
    "let us expand a bit more on the latter conditions , which turn out to play a crucial role in our analysis .",
    "as for the unitarity bounds , and following ref .",
    "@xcite , the basic underlying strategy is to compute the s - matrix elements @xmath61 for the possible @xmath62 processes involving higgs and goldstone bosons in the 2hdm , and to subsequently restrain the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath63 by the generic condition @xmath64 .",
    "the latter requirement translates into a set of upper bounds on the quartic scalar couplings @xmath65  and hence on combinations of higgs masses , trigonometric couplings and , most significantly , the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "as far as vacuum stability restrictions are concerned @xcite , they may be written as follows : @xmath66 > 0 \\label{eq : vacuum_conditions}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more refined versions of these equations may be obtained from the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the quartic couplings @xmath67 at high energies .",
    "nonetheless , for our current purposes we need not assume any particular uv completion of the 2hdm .",
    "this would be an unnecessary additional assumption at this stage of the phenomenological analysis of our processes .",
    "therefore , we are not tied to any specific uv - cutoff ( which could be , in principle , as low as @xmath68 ) . in this sense",
    ", we may just apply eq .   with all @xmath42 taken at the ew scale .",
    "this is after all the scale at which we fix all our input parameters and perform the phenomenological analysis ( including the renormalization ) of the processes under study . by the same token",
    ", the ( cutoff dependent ) triviality bounds are also circumvented .",
    "the latter kind of restrictions only impose tight upper limits on the higgs boson masses when a very large uv - cutoff ( e.g. the planck scale or the gut scale ) is considered .",
    "our choices of higgs boson mass spectra ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : masses ] ) lie , in any case , in a sufficiently low mass range so as to conform with the typical mass requirements allowed by triviality  @xcite  even for large cutoff scales .",
    "more details on the constraints setup are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "c   +   +   +   +   +   +    the dynamics of the higgs - strahlung processes under consideration is driven at leading order by the tree - level interaction lagrangians : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the electroweak mixing angle @xmath72 . since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , it is clear that the processes ( [ eq : hz ] ) are complementary to the higgs pair production ones ( [ 2h ] ) . furthermore , as all these couplings ( [ eq : lag0 ] ) are generated by the gauged kinetic terms of the higgs doublets ( cf .",
    "( 30 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , they are fully determined by the gauge symmetry and hence show no intrinsic difference in the 2hdm as compared to the mssm . at the end of the day , this is the reason why a tree - level analysis of these events is most likely insufficient to disclose their true nature .",
    "similarly , in the limit @xmath75 the @xmath76 coupling coincides with the analogue coupling in the sm , @xmath77 .",
    "it is , therefore , the pattern of radiative corrections the characteristic signature associated to each one of the possible models ; most particularly , it should help to disentangle susy versus non - susy extended higgs physics scenarios .",
    "the leading - order @xmath78 scattering amplitude follows from the @xmath79-channel @xmath0-boson exchange and renders @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 refer to the 4-momenta and helicities of the electron and positron , and @xmath83 is the polarization 4-vector of the @xmath84 gauge boson with 4-momentum @xmath85 and helicity @xmath86 .",
    "we have introduced also the left and right - handed weak couplings of the @xmath0 boson to the electron , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and the left and right - handed projectors @xmath89 .",
    "let us notice that we do not include the finite @xmath0-width corrections , since they are completely negligible for the center - of - mass energies that we consider here .",
    "finally , the total cross section @xmath90 at the tree - level is obtained after squaring the matrix element  , performing an averaged sum over the polarizations of the colliding @xmath91 beams and the outflowing @xmath0 boson , and integrating over the scattering angle .",
    "the calculation of @xmath90 at one loop is certainly much more cumbersome . to start with , it is uv - divergent and it thus requires of a careful renormalization procedure in order to render finite results .",
    "we adopt here the conventional on - shell scheme in the feynman gauge  @xcite . in the mssm",
    ", these cross - section calculations can be mostly carried out in an automatized fashion through standard algebraic packages which allow a rapid and efficient analysis of the electroweak precision observables@xcite .",
    "several public codes are available , see e.g.@xcite . however , in our case the calculation is non - supersymmetric and we must deal with the renormalization of the higgs sector in the class of generic 2hdm models . a detailed description of the renormalization procedure for the 2hdm higgs sector in the on - shell scheme has been presented in @xcite and we refer the reader to this reference for all the necessary details .",
    "we will make constant use of the framework described in this reference and sometimes we will refer to particular formulae of it .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     a rather comprehensive survey of the predicted cross - sections for different values of the tree - level coupling and different higgs mass setups is presented in table  [ tab : xs500 ] .",
    "we display the results for the one - loop corrected cross - sections ( in fb ) , together with the relative radiative corrections ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , for both neutral higgs - strahlung channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "once more , we set @xmath92 ; and we work at @xmath93 and maximum allowed @xmath94 , since we are mostly interested in spotlighting the imprints of the 3h self - couplings in the quantum effects associated to the higgs - strahlung mechanism .",
    "let us also recall in passing that @xmath95 maximizes the tree - level @xmath76 coupling , whilst @xmath96 is optimal in the complementary regime , @xmath97 . from the table we may read out that radiative corrections in these regimes are certainly large , regardless of the details of the chosen mass spectrum , the tree - level coupling and the actual channel under consideration . in a nutshell : the characteristic signature of the enhanced 3h self - couplings in the pattern of quantum effects on the higgs - strahlung processes is rather universal and manifests in the form of a substantial depletion of the tree - level signal ( typically in the range of @xmath98 ) .",
    "fortunately , even under such a dramatic suppression the final loop - corrected cross sections stay at the level of a few tens of fb  thereby amounting to a non - negligible yield of @xmath99 events per @xmath100 .",
    "a note of caution should be given at this point in regard to some particular configurations of the @xmath2 channel .",
    "it turns out that certain choices of higgs boson masses ( e.g. for mssm - like mass splittings ) may lie close , or simply beyond , the kinematical threshold for the decay process @xmath101 ; that is to say , @xmath102 . if we then consider a regime wherein @xmath97 and sizable @xmath94 , then the @xmath19 wf - correction undergoes a remarkable boost , which results from the combination of two independent sources of enhancement , namely i ) the actual strength of the @xmath103 coupling  which is maximally enlarged in this regime ; and ii ) the kinematical enhancement due to the vicinity of the @xmath104 threshold , which is reflected as a sharp peak in @xmath105",
    "however , these @xmath106 wf - corrections become so large that the perturbative formula   is no longer valid and we have to keep the original ( unexpanded ) expression @xmath107^{-1/2}$ ] . out of such corner in the parameter space ,",
    "the higher - order effects involved in the above resummed form of the wf - corrections become harmless and totally inconspicuous and can be safely discarded . if , alternatively , we were considering a mass setup such that @xmath108 , then the decay @xmath101 would be open and , in the scenario of maximum @xmath103 coupling , it would furnish a very large width for @xmath106 . in this particular setup",
    ", the process would effectively boil down to the double higgs - strahlung channels @xmath109 previously explored in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the following comment is in order to clarify the role played by the remaining ( potential ) sources of enhancement .",
    "we have seen that the various constraints restrict very significantly the range of allowed values of @xmath39 , and enforce it to stay around @xmath110 when @xmath94 is maximum in the region @xmath111 . as a result",
    ", the contributions from the top quark and bottom quark yukawa couplings can not be augmented in the domain where the trilinear couplings are maximal .",
    "remarkably enough , let us also emphasize that they can not be enhanced even in the region where @xmath94 is small or zero . to see why , notice that although in such region the parameter @xmath39 can be very large or small and still be compatible with the constraints ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : iso ] ) , then all the terms in the trilinear couplings ( cf .",
    "table ii of ref.@xcite ) which are not proportional to @xmath9 become of order one ( i.e. can not be promoted to high values ) in the regime where the tree - level production cross - section for @xmath112 or @xmath106 is optimal .",
    "not only so , in the very same regime the yukawa couplings of both the top and bottom quarks can not be enhanced either .",
    "one can easily check all these features explicitly by observing that , in the regions where the corresponding tree - level processes are maximal , the @xmath39-enhancements are canceled in all the couplings .",
    "we have checked numerically that the residual corrections ( positive and negative ) are merely of a few percent for any value of @xmath39 . at the end of the day , we conclude that the only sizeable and eventually measurable quantum effects on the processes under study are those stemming potentially from the enhancement of the @xmath9 coupling , not from the yukawa couplings .",
    "let us finally emphasize that the complementarity between the neutral final states @xmath1/@xmath15 and @xmath2/@xmath16 , i.e. processes ( [ 2h ] ) and ( [ eq : hz ] ) , is a unique chance for analyzing potentially big correlations between quantum effects in the 2hdm production cross sections , as there is no similar opportunity in the charged sector . indeed , the final state charged counterparts @xmath113 are suppressed owing to the fact that the @xmath114 vertices are forbidden at the tree - level in any 2hdm extension of the sm@xcite and therefore they can only be studied in more general extensions of the higgs sector@xcite , or through loop - induced @xmath113 vertices in the 2hdm@xcite and in the mssm@xcite . in these loop - induced mechanisms , the cross section for the associated @xmath113 production in a linear collider is rather meager  generally below @xmath110 fb at the startup ilc energy ( for charged higgs masses comparable to the ones we have considered for the @xmath1/@xmath15 production ) and within the region allowed by the current constraints .",
    "we therefore deem quite difficult to use the @xmath113 channel to extract additional information . in our opinion",
    ", the main task should be focused on performing precision tests of the @xmath1/@xmath15 final states , together with the @xmath2/@xmath16 ones ( if the mass of the heavy @xmath31-even higgs is not too large ) .",
    "in this article , we have concentrated on the analysis of the production of neutral higgs bosons in association with the @xmath0 gauge boson at the future linac facilities within the framework of the general ( non - supersymmetric ) two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "our basic endeavor has been twofold : i ) on the one hand to study the impact of radiative corrections to the final predicted rates ; and ii ) on the other hand to correlate such quantum effects with the enhancement potential of the 3h self - interactions , which are a genuine dynamical feature of the 2hdm  in the sense that it is unmatched to its supersymmetric counterpart .",
    "the upshot of our analysis singles out sizable ( although negative ) quantum effects which are correlated to the enhancement properties of the 3h self - interactions in the general 2hdm . such large effects are identified fundamentally in the region of parameter space with @xmath115 and where the coupling @xmath94 is at its maximum possible value compatible with the various constraints .",
    "the quantum effects reach typically @xmath116 , for @xmath117 ( @xmath10 ) , this being the crucial parameter that tunes the actual size of the 3h self - couplings .",
    "let us stress that the most stringent limits on @xmath9 are placed by the conditions of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability - meson physics constraints over the 2hdm parameter space suggests that values of @xmath8 could be disfavored for charged higgs masses @xmath118 too near to the lowest mass limit of @xmath119 gev ( and certainly below ) @xcite .",
    "however , the level of significance is not high and , in addition , our leading quantum corrections are basically insensitive to the charged higgs mass .",
    "therefore , a shift of @xmath118 slightly upwards restores the possibility of @xmath8 at , say , @xmath120 without altering significantly our results ( as we have explicitly checked ) . ] .",
    "although the vertex corrections to the @xmath121 couplings are sensitive to such 3h self - interactions through higgs - mediated one - loop diagrams , the most significant quantum effects are induced by the wave - function renormalization corrections to the @xmath122 higgs boson external lines .",
    "these ( negative ) effects triggered by the trilinear couplings are of order @xmath123 , and are therefore very responsive to changes in the value of the parameter @xmath9 in the higgs potential of the 2hdm . in turn",
    ", the gauge - boson and fermion one - loop contributions remain subleading ( including the effects from the yukawa couplings ) as they show no remarkable departures from their sm analogues in the relevant regions of parameter space  which yield @xmath124 at the level of a few percent .",
    "most important is also the fact that the combined analysis of such higgs - strahlung events with the previously considered higgs - pair production processes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) ",
    "see @xcite for details  could be instrumental as a highly sensitive probe of the underlying architecture of the higgs sector . at the fiducial center - of - mass energy value of @xmath92 , and",
    "when the genuine enhancement mechanisms of the 2hdm are active , the @xmath125 events are remarkably strengthened at the one - loop level while the @xmath126 channels are simultaneously depleted .",
    "we can assert that the described pattern of leading quantum effects emerges as a kind of `` universal '' feature of the 2hdm as far as the predictions for the higgs - strahlung processes are concerned , meaning that this pattern is virtually independent of the details of the higgs mass spectrum and of the actual production channel ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "the same is true for the pairwise production channels@xcite .",
    "therefore they all can be physically significant provided the produced higgs boson is not too heavy for the actual center - of - mass energy .",
    "focusing on the higgs - strahlung processes , the rise of large ( and negative ) radiative corrections to their cross - sections within the 2hdm can be regarded as a characteristic imprint of a general two - higgs - doublet model structure .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a @xmath0-boson in the final state ( and hence of its clear - cut leptonic signature @xmath127 ) should enable a rather comfortable tagging of these higgs events following a method entirely similar to the original bjorken mechanism@xcite in the sm .",
    "although the corresponding cross - sections at the higher operating energies planned for the future linear colliders are smaller ( as compared to lep ) , they are nevertheless sufficiently sizeable ( typically in the range @xmath128 fb ) for a relatively comfortable practical measurement at the higher luminosities scheduled for these machines .",
    "for example , the associated decay of the accompanying neutral @xmath17-even higgs - boson would manifest basically in the form of either i ) collimated and highly - energetic @xmath129-quark or @xmath130-lepton jets , for @xmath131 gev ; and ii ) @xmath132 + missing energy ; or @xmath133 , for @xmath134 ( in the optimal regime for the tree - level process ) .",
    "some discussion on how the corresponding mssm higgs boson production cross - sections compare to the 2hdm ones seems also appropriate . in the mssm ,",
    "the maximum quantum effects on @xmath126 production are typically milder . here",
    ", the dominance of the wf - corrections is also the main source of one - loop effects@xcite .",
    "they are usually reabsorbed into the tree - level @xmath135 couplings ( [ eq : lag0 ] ) , specifically in the @xmath31-even mixing angle @xmath49 , which then becomes an effective mixing parameter .",
    "consider , for example , the behavior of the characteristic trigonometric coupling @xmath136 in the @xmath137 interaction vertex , which in the mssm dies away with growing values of @xmath138 ( both at the tree - level and at one - loop ) .",
    "it follows that in a situation where @xmath138 is sufficiently heavy , say above @xmath139 gev , the mssm would predict measurable rates for the channel @xmath1 ( and also for @xmath16 , if @xmath7 is sufficiently high ) , whereas the complementary channels ( @xmath140 ) would be virtually below the observability threshold . in contrast , in this particular sm - like regime ( in which @xmath141 ) the @xmath1 cross - section in the 2hdm could well be exhibiting the trademark suppression induced at one - loop by large 3h self - couplings .",
    "furthermore , in the mssm , the dynamical origin of the leading wf - effects does not reside in the higgs boson self - couplings , but on the yukawa couplings with fermions and also in the large yukawa - like couplings of higgs bosons with sfermions , particularly with the stop .",
    "thus , in both models ( 2hdm or mssm ) the main source of quantum effects emanates from the renormalization of the higgs boson external lines , but the kind of interactions involved in each case is radically different . on the quantitative side ,",
    "the impact of the quantum effects in the mssm case turns out to be considerably milder and as a consequence the cross - sections for higgs - strahlung production remain similar to the sm cross - section ( i.e. for the bjorken process ) .",
    "the corresponding 2hdm cross - sections , instead , can be significantly smaller  if taking the same higgs boson masses ( e.g. sets a and b of table  [ tab : masses ] , which mimic the mssm higgs boson mass spectrum ) owing to the aforementioned large suppression effect from the higgs boson wf renormalization . at the same time , as we have already mentioned , the cross - sections for neutral higgs boson pair production in the general 2hdm  cf .",
    "eq.([2h ] )  become substantially larger than the mssm counterparts ( for the same higgs boson mass spectrum ) , carrying very sizeable and positive quantum effects@xcite . therefore , an interesting combined picture emerges in the 2hdm context , in which a large ( @xmath142 ) enhancement of the pairwise neutral higgs boson production is simultaneously accompanied by a drastic drop ( of similar size ) of the higgs - strahlung events . as this situation is completely impossible to realize in the mssm , this feature could be used as a strong characteristic signature to discriminate between these processes in the general 2hdm and in the mssm . in other words",
    ", it could provide an essential quantum handle enabling us to perform a proper identification of the kind of higgs bosons produced in a linear collider .    in summary ,",
    "we have analyzed the classical higgs - boson strahlung processes at linear colliders in the light of the general 2hdm , and we have elucidated very significant quantum imprints which spotlight , once more , the stupendous phenomenological possibilities that triple higgs boson self - interactions could encapsulate in non - supersymmetric extended higgs sectors . to be sure , regardless of whether the lhc is finally capable to discover the higgs boson(s ) , a paramount effort will still be mandatory in order to completely settle its experimental basis and to uncover the nature of the spinless constituents behind the electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "as we have shown , experiments at the future linear collider facilities could play a crucial role in this momentous endeavor .    *",

    "<S> the associated production of neutral higgs bosons with the @xmath0 gauge boson ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is investigated in the context of the future linear colliders , such as the ilc and clic , within the general two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the corresponding cross - section for the processes @xmath3 at one - loop , including the full set of corrections at @xmath4 together with the leading @xmath5 terms , in full consistency with the available theoretical and phenomenological constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wave - function corrections to the external higgs fields are the dominant source of the quantum effects , which turn out to be large and negative ( e.g. @xmath6 ) in all the @xmath7 range , and located predominantly in the region around @xmath8 and moderate values of the parameter @xmath9 ( being @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be ultimately traced back to the enhancement potential of the triple higgs boson self - couplings , a trademark feature of the 2hdm with no counterpart in the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . even under this substantial depletion of the one - loop corrected signal ( which is also highly distinctive with respect to the sm expectation for @xmath11 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted higgs - strahlung rates comfortably reach a few tens of femtobarn , which means barely @xmath12 events per @xmath13 @xmath14 of integrated luminosity . due to their great complementarity , we argue that the combined analysis of the higgs - strahlung events ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and the previously computed one - loop higgs - pair production processes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) could be instrumental to probe the structure of the higgs sector at future linac facilities . </S>"
