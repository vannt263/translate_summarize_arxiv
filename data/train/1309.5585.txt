    "triple_.    the study of irreducible triples has a long history , dating back to fundamental work of dynkin in the 1950s . in @xcite , dynkin determined the maximal closed connected subgroups of the classical matrix groups over @xmath11 .",
    "one of the most difficult parts of the analysis concerns irreducible simple subgroups ; here dynkin lists all the triples @xmath8 where @xmath0 is a simple closed irreducible subgroup of @xmath12 different from @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 is a positive - dimensional closed connected subgroup of @xmath0 such that @xmath5 is an irreducible module for @xmath4 .    not surprisingly , the analogous problem in the positive characteristic setting is much more difficult .",
    "for example , complete reducibility may fail for rational modules for simple groups , and we have no general formula for the dimensions of irreducible modules . in the 1980s , seitz @xcite initiated the investigation of irreducible triples over fields of positive characteristic as part of a wider study of the subgroup structure of finite and algebraic simple groups . by introducing several new tools and techniques , which differed greatly from those employed by dynkin",
    ", seitz determined all irreducible triples @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is a simply connected simple algebraic group of classical type defined over any algebraically closed field @xmath1 and @xmath4 is a closed connected subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "this was extended by testerman @xcite to exceptional algebraic groups @xmath0 ( of type @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) , again for @xmath4 a closed connected subgroup . in all cases",
    "@xmath4 is semisimple , and in view of steinberg s tensor product theorem , one may assume that @xmath5 is @xmath6-restricted as a @xmath7-module ( where @xmath20 denotes the characteristic of @xmath1 , and one adopts the convention that every @xmath7-module is @xmath6-restricted if @xmath21 ) . in both papers , the irreducible triples @xmath8 are presented in tables , giving the highest weights of the modules @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the work of seitz and testerman provides a complete classification of the triples @xmath8 with @xmath4 connected , so it is natural to consider the analogous problem for disconnected positive - dimensional subgroups . a recent paper of ghandour @xcite handles the case where @xmath0 is exceptional , so",
    "let us assume @xmath0 is a classical group . in @xcite , ford studies irreducible triples in the special case where @xmath0 is a simple classical algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath20 , and @xmath4 is a closed disconnected subgroup such that the connected component @xmath24 is simple and the restriction @xmath25 has @xmath6-restricted composition factors .",
    "these extra assumptions help to simplify the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , under these hypotheses ford discovered a very interesting family of triples @xmath8 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , these examples were found to have applications to the representation theory of the symmetric groups , and led to a proof of the mullineux conjecture ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , for future applications it is desirable to study the general problem for classical groups , without any extra conditions on the composition factors of @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    "we treat the case of irreducible triples @xmath8 where @xmath0 is of classical type , @xmath4 is maximal among closed positive - dimensional subgroups of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is a @xmath6-restricted irreducible tensor indecomposable @xmath7-module . using steinberg s tensor product theorem , one can obtain all irreducible triples @xmath8 as above , without requiring the @xmath6-restricted condition on @xmath5 .",
    "we now explain precisely the content of this paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple classical algebraic group over an algebraically closed field @xmath1 of characteristic @xmath20 with natural module @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the full isometry group of a suitable form @xmath30 on @xmath3 , namely , the zero bilinear form , a symplectic form , or a non - degenerate quadratic form .",
    "we write @xmath31 to denote the respective simple classical groups @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined in this way .",
    "note that @xmath35 , with the exception that if @xmath36 , @xmath30 is quadratic and @xmath37 is even , then @xmath0 has index 2 in @xmath38 .",
    "a key theorem on the subgroup structure of @xmath0 is due to liebeck and seitz , which provides an algebraic group analogue of aschbacher s well known subgroup structure theorem for finite classical groups . in @xcite ,",
    "six natural ( or _ geometric _ ) families of subgroups of @xmath0 are defined in terms of the underlying geometry of @xmath3 , labelled @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "for instance , these collections include the stabilizers of subspaces of @xmath3 , and the stabilizers of direct sum and tensor product decompositions of @xmath3 .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite states that if @xmath4 is a positive - dimensional closed subgroup of @xmath0 then either @xmath4 is contained in a subgroup in one of the @xmath39 collections , or roughly speaking , @xmath24 is simple ( modulo scalars ) and @xmath24 acts irreducibly on @xmath3 .",
    "( more precisely , modulo scalars , @xmath4 is _ almost simple _ in the sense that it is contained in the group of algebraic automorphisms of the simple group @xmath24 . )",
    "we write @xmath41 to denote this additional collection of ` non - geometric ' subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a maximal closed positive - dimensional disconnected subgroup of a simple classical algebraic group @xmath42 as above , let @xmath5 be a rational irreducible @xmath7-module and assume @xmath43 or @xmath44 , where @xmath44 denotes the dual of @xmath3 .",
    "the irreducible triples @xmath8 such that @xmath25 is irreducible are easily deduced from the aforementioned work of seitz @xcite , so we focus on the situation where @xmath23 is irreducible , but @xmath25 is reducible .",
    "by clifford theory , the highest weights of @xmath45-composition factors of @xmath5 are @xmath4-conjugate and we can exploit this to restrict the possibilities for @xmath5 .",
    "this approach , based on a combinatorial analysis of weights , is effective when @xmath4 belongs to one of the geometric @xmath39 families since we have an explicit description of the embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath0 . in this way ,",
    "all the irreducible triples @xmath8 where @xmath4 is a disconnected positive - dimensional maximal geometric subgroup of @xmath0 have been determined in @xcite . however , in general , an explicit description of the embeddings of the subgroups in the family @xmath41 is not available , so in this situation an entirely different analysis is required .    the main aim of this paper is to determine the irreducible triples @xmath8 in the case where @xmath4 is a positive - dimensional disconnected subgroup in the collection @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely , we will assume @xmath8 satisfies the precise conditions recorded in hypothesis [ h : our ] below . by definition ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) , every positive - dimensional subgroup @xmath46 has the following three properties :    * @xmath24 is a simple algebraic group , @xmath47 ; * @xmath24 acts irreducibly and tensor indecomposably on @xmath3 ; * if @xmath48 then @xmath24 does not fix a non - degenerate form on @xmath3 .    in particular",
    ", since we are assuming @xmath4 is disconnected and @xmath24 is irreducible , it follows that @xmath49 modulo scalars , that is , @xmath50 so @xmath51 ( here @xmath52 denotes the group of algebraic automorphisms of @xmath24 , rather than the abstract automorphism group . )",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath4 is maximal in @xmath0 but we will not invoke this condition , in general .",
    "however , there is one situation where we do assume maximality . indeed , if @xmath53 , @xmath36 and @xmath4 fixes a non - degenerate quadratic form on @xmath3 then @xmath54 . since the special case @xmath55 with @xmath36 is handled in @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.2.7 ) ) , this leads naturally to the following additional hypothesis :    * if @xmath53 and @xmath36 then @xmath24 does not fix a non - degenerate quadratic form on @xmath3 .",
    "note that if @xmath24 is a classical group then conditions s3 and s4 imply that @xmath3 is not the natural @xmath45-module .",
