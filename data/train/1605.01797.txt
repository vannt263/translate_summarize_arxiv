    "in these supplemental materials we explore several issues related to the operation of the charge quadrupole qubit .",
    "the cq ( charge quadrupole ) qubit is less susceptible to charge noise than a cd ( charge dipole ) qubit because in solid state devices the dipolar component of the charge noise , @xmath38 , is typically much larger than the quadrupolar component , @xmath39 . here",
    ", we estimate the relative strengths of these two components based on experimental measurements of charge noise in semiconducting qubit devices , assuming that both types of electric field noise arise from the same remote charge fluctuators .",
    "we begin by considering charge noise from remote charge traps in the semiconductor device  @xcite . as a simple model ,",
    "we consider a charge trap with two possible states : occupied vs.  empty .",
    "compared to a dipole fluctuator , in which the charge toggles between two configurations , the monopole fluctuator can be considered a worst - case scenario because the monopole potential decays as @xmath132 while the dipole potential decays as @xmath133 , where @xmath47 is the dot - fluctuator separation .",
    "following ref  , this monopole model can be used to estimate the characteristic separation @xmath47 between the fluctuator and the quantum dot , based on charge noise measurements in a double - dot charge qubit .",
    "experimental measurements of the dephasing of charge qubits  @xcite yield estimates for the standard deviation of the dipole detuning parameter , @xmath134 , which range between roughly @xmath135 and @xmath136  @xmath137ev for double dots separated by @xmath138  nm , leading to estimates for the dot - fluctuator separation @xmath139  @xmath137 m .    with this information",
    ", we can estimate the ratio @xmath113 . in a worst - case scenario , corresponding to the strongest quadrupolar fluctuations , the monopole fluctuator would be lined up along the same axis as the triple dot . adopting a point - charge approximation for the fluctuator potential , @xmath140 , and assuming an interdot spacing @xmath141 , equation  ( [ eq : epsq ] ) of the main text yields @xmath142 taking @xmath143  nm , and @xmath144 - 3  @xmath137 m , we estimate that @xmath145 - 0.2 for typical devices .",
    "in other words , in current devices quadrupolar detuning fluctuations should be @xmath13010 times weaker than dipolar detuning fluctuations .",
    "moreover , new generations of quantum dots in heterostructures without modulation doping  @xcite have the potential to achieve much smaller @xmath46 , which would further suppress @xmath113 .",
    "the scaling expression in equation  ( [ eq : lscaling ] ) is one of the most appealing arguments for exploring cq qubits , which couple primarily to gradient field fluctuations , because the dephasing effects of the quadrupolar fluctuations can always be suppressed by shrinking the interdot distance . indeed ,",
    "quantum devices with dot separations @xmath146  nm have recently been reported  @xcite , corresponding to a further reduction in @xmath113 by a factor of 4 compared to the estimate above .",
    "the combined requirements of @xmath41 and @xmath40 suggest that the optimized cq qubit geometry should be highly symmetric . other types of symmetric geometries have also been proposed for improving the operation of charge - based qubits in superconducting cooper - pair boxes @xcite , as well as an exchange - only logical spin qubit  @xcite . to achieve such symmetry in a triple - dot qubit",
    ", we must assume that @xmath147 and @xmath23 are independently tunable .    in the main text",
    ", we assume that uniform electric field fluctuations , @xmath148 , couple to @xmath27 but not to @xmath28",
    ". however , this statement contains some hidden assumptions about the symmetries of a triple dot , which may not be valid when we account for dot variability . here",
    ", we show that if the triple - dot symmetry is imperfect , uniform field fluctuations could induce effective quadrupolar fluctuations @xmath39 that potentially spoil the cq noise protection , and we explain how to avoid this problem .",
    "quantum dots are confined in all three dimensions .",
    "the vertical confinement is typically very strong , so we can apply the usual subband approximation and treat the dot as two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite . let us begin with a 1d parabolic approximation for the lateral confinement potential in a single dot : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the dot index , @xmath151 is the splitting between the simple harmonic energy levels , @xmath152 is the center of the dot , and @xmath153 is the local potential",
    ". a more accurate description of @xmath154 could include anharmonic terms , which would yield higher - order corrections to the results obtained here .",
    "the parameters @xmath155 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 all depend on voltages applied to the top gates .",
    "we assume that the @xmath153 are adjusted to satisfy the requirement that @xmath41 , and henceforth ignore them .",
    "the dot positions @xmath152 can also be controlled electrostatically by tuning the gate voltages near the dot .",
    "the parameter @xmath155 is the most difficult to adjust after device fabrication , because it is mainly determined by the fixed top - gate geometry , or other fixed features in the electrostatic landscape .",
    "electrons in dots with different @xmath155 respond differently to @xmath148 , and can therefore potentially affect the symmetries of a cq qubit . however , we now show that dot - to - dot variations in @xmath155 do not couple to @xmath148 fluctuations at linear order .",
    "a uniform fluctuating field @xmath148 introduces a term of form @xmath156 in the energy . adding this term to equation  ( [ eq : vi ] ) and rearranging yields @xmath157 where @xmath158 represents the shifted center of the dot . considering the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : vi2 ] )",
    ", we note that the energy of a shifted harmonic oscillator does not depend on its position , @xmath159 .",
    "dot - to - dot variations in this term therefore do not depend on @xmath148 , and can be compensated by adjusting the potentials @xmath153 .",
    "the leading order fluctuation term in equation  ( [ eq : vi2 ] ) is therefore @xmath160 , which does not depend on @xmath155 .",
    "the coupling between @xmath148 and @xmath155 only arises at higher order , in the third term of equation  ( [ eq : vi2 ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath160 in equation  ( [ eq : vi2 ] ) can be viewed as fluctuating site potentials @xmath161 .",
    "the cq design strategy provides a mechanism for eliminating the leading order dipolar detuning fluctuations .",
    "however , from the definition of the quadrupolar detuning in equation  ( [ eq : epsq ] ) of the main text , we see that the quadrupolar detuning fluctuations are given by @xmath162 in other words , _ uniform _ electric field fluctuations can also generate _",
    "quadrupolar _ detuning fluctuations .",
    "fortunately , it is straightforward to suppress this effect by adjusting the dot separations to make them equal : @xmath163 repeating this analysis for the dot confinement along the @xmath81 axis , we obtain the additional requirement that @xmath164 hence , the three dots must be equally spaced along a line .",
    "these new symmetry requirements are not oppressive , and can be achieved by simply including two top gates to fine - tune the @xmath80 and @xmath81 positions of one of the dots ; such fine - tuning can even be accomplished via automated methods  @xcite .",
    "moreover , small errors in the dot position , @xmath165 , can be tolerated since they only increase the detuning by a linear factor , @xmath166 , where we have expressed the uniform field fluctuations in terms of the dipolar detuning parameter .",
    "here , we perform simulations to characterize leakage errors for pulsed gates in cq qubits , to check the analytical estimates provided in the main text , which were obtained by assuming instantaneous voltage pulses .",
    "we consider a gate starting at the fully symmetric point ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) and then pulse the quadrupolar detuning @xmath28 , keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "the pulse turn - on and turn - off functions are modeled as half - cosines with angular frequencies set to be the smallest that yield a gate rotation angle of @xmath169 and thus are the longest for which an @xmath170 gate can be implemented using the sequence in ref  .",
    "longer rise times are advantageous because they are simpler to implement experimentally , and because the leakage tends to decrease as the rise time is increased .",
    "we assume that dipolar fluctuations are dominant ; in this case , by rescaling the time appropriately , one can see that the fidelity is a function of the ratio @xmath171 .",
    "we find , consistent with the discussion in the main text , that the leakage probability @xmath172 satisfies @xmath173 , where @xmath2 indicates the initial basis state ( @xmath174 or @xmath175 ) .",
    "for the specific case where the pulse is gated between @xmath176 and @xmath177 , we find @xmath178 , @xmath179 . for this gate , a leakage rate @xmath180 is achieved for @xmath181 . if one chooses @xmath182ghz ( roughly 16.5  @xmath183 ) , which yields an experimentally feasible qubit frequency of @xmath184  ghz  @xcite , the noise amplitude must be @xmath185  @xmath137ev , which is comparable to but somewhat smaller than values reported in recent experiments  @xcite .",

    "<S> to achieve robust implementation of semiconducting qubits , one must overcome the effects of charge noise that currently limit the coherence of gate operations . here </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize the concept of decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) that has been applied to spins and propose a dfs for charge that protects solid - state qubits from uniform electric field fluctuations during gating operations . </S>",
    "<S> the logical qubit is formed from states with charge distributions that differ but have the same center of mass , and are decoupled from leakage state(s ) in a larger hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we present a specific implementation for a charge qubit in a triple quantum dot , which we call the charge quadrupole ( cq ) qubit , which should provide at least an order of magnitude improvement for coherence times compared to a conventional charge qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we describe architectures for implementing couplings between cq qubits and to external charge devices , such as microwave resonators . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the concept can be extended to protect spin - based logical qubits from charge noise during gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> these results improve the outlook for coherent quantum operations in many solid - state devices .    due to the fragility of quantum information , multiple layers of error suppression will be needed for any scalable implementation of a quantum computer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> active suppression methods include quantum error correction@xcite and composite pulse sequences@xcite , while passive strategies include forming decoherence - free subspaces or subsystems@xcite ( dfs ) , and optimal working points@xcite (  sweet spots \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> dfs are particularly attractive , because of their minimal overhead requirements . </S>",
    "<S> previous proposals for dfs in quantum dots have focused on spin qubits and the decoherence caused by uniform magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath0@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath1 is a spin operator for the @xmath2th qubit , then the fluctuation hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the land @xmath4-factor and @xmath5 is the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> a dfs then corresponds to a logical encoding of the qubit for which both states are equally affected by the fluctuation .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , recent experiments suggest that the dominant noise source for spin qubits is electric field noise@xcite (  charge noise \" ) , which rapidly degrades the quantum coherence when the spins are coupled via exchange interactions@xcite , or effectively transformed into charge qubits@xcite via spin - to - charge conversions@xcite , such as those proposed for two - qubit gates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for a uniform electric field fluctuation @xmath6 acting on an array of charges takes the form @xmath7 , where the position operator for the @xmath2th electron , @xmath8 , plays an explicit role for charge fluctuations , in contrast to magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this position dependence appears incompatible with dfs requirements for localized charge states , suggesting that it may be impossible to form a dfs for charge qubits , or spin qubits that exploit the charge sector . </S>",
    "<S> recent efforts to suppress the effects of charge noise in quantum dots have therefore focused on sweet spots , which typically occur at energy level anticrossings , and suppress the leading order effects of @xmath9@xcite . in this paper , we show that , contrary to expectations , certain dot geometries do support a dfs for charge , and we propose a new type of charge qubit that we call a charge quadrupole ( cq ) .    before describing the cq qubit in detail , we first recall a dfs for spins : three spins can encode a dfs that protects against arbitrary uniform magnetic field fluctuations@xcite , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the dfs consists of two states with the same values of the total spin along the quantization axis , @xmath11 and of the total spin @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the dfs has two important properties : first , the difference in the energies of the two qubit states is independent of magnetic field , and second , changing a spin - independent hamiltonian causes the system to evolve only between the qubit states ; the other states are not accessed because they are not coupled to the qubit states by the hamiltonian .    here </S>",
    "<S> we construct a situation that enables similar considerations to be applied to logical charge states that are protected against uniform electric field variations . </S>",
    "<S> all linear superpositions of the two qubit states must have the same total charge and also have the same center of mass , so that the contribution to the energy from a uniform field , @xmath13 , is the same for all qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is important that the system hamiltonian does not couple the qubit states to the other states in the full hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are satisfied if the hamiltonian conserves charge and has an appropriate symmetry : the qubit logical states should have the same total charge and be eigenstates of a symmetry operator with the same eigenvalue . an appropriate candidate is a central dot that is symmetrically coupled to a set of outer dots having the same center of mass as the center dot , even under permutation . </S>",
    "<S> analogous to the situation for a spin dfs@xcite , the symmetry constraints can not be satisfied in a two - dimensional ( double - dot ) code space ; the smallest device that can support a charge dfs is a triple dot .    </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a linear triple dot geometry , where the symmetry operation is the permutation operator between the outer two dots , @xmath14 , which is equivalent to reflection about the center . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to adopt the logical basis states @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to  center \" and  even . \" </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath14 eigenvalue is @xmath18 , corresponding to even symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the third orthogonal state , @xmath19 , is odd upon reflection and generates a dipole that couples to charge fluctuations when superposed with @xmath20 . when symmetry constraints are satisfied , the even and odd manifolds decouple .    </S>",
    "<S> the logical charge states of a cq qubit are protected from uniform electric field fluctuations because their charge distributions have the same center of mass ( in other words , no dipole moment ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that several related systems also propose to use dipole - free geometries , including the zero - detuning sweet spot of a conventional charge qubit  @xcite , which we analyze below , and quantum cellular automata  .    </S>",
    "<S> we now examine the cq qubit in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a triple dot with one electron , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : main ] . </S>",
    "<S> the full hamiltonian in the position basis is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the tunneling amplitudes between neighboring dots , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are site potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we have also defined the dipolar and quadrupolar detuning parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 the eigenvalues of @xmath30 are plotted as a function of @xmath28 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : main ] , where the lowest and highest energy levels correspond to the logical states @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and the middle level is the leakage state @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement is an uncommon but benign feature of the cq qubit , as shown below . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare @xmath30 to a conventional , one - electron charge qubit formed in a double dot , which we refer to as a charge dipole ( cd ) : @xmath34 in this case , @xmath35 is the dipole detuning , and there is no quadrupole detuning . in what follows , we express the detuning parameters in terms of their average ( @xmath36 ) and fluctuating ( @xmath37 ) components . </S>",
    "<S> uniform electric field fluctuations are then associated with @xmath38 , while fluctuations of the field gradient are associated with @xmath39 .    ) and </S>",
    "<S> even ( @xmath17 ) states correspond to the logical basis , and are shown on the right , where the half - filled circles represent an average occupation of 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the symmetric tuning , @xmath40 , with the dipolar detuning parameter set to @xmath41 , the qubit is insensitive to small uniform electric field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) energy levels for equation  ( [ eq : hcq ] ) as a function of quadrupolar detuning @xmath28 , showing the logical states @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the leakage state @xmath33 . here , @xmath42  </S>",
    "<S> ghz and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the insets depict the quadrupolar detuning parameters defined in equation  ( [ eq : epsq]).,width=316 ]    charge qubits are known to respond differently to noise in the dipolar vs.  quadrupolar channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in @xmath38 are dangerous for single - qubit operations since they cause fluctuations of the energy splitting between the qubit levels , @xmath44 , resulting in phase fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the dfs depends on our ability to engineer a triple - dot in which the dephasing effects of @xmath38 fluctuations are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the next - leading source of fluctuations , @xmath39 , is much weaker , and we show in the supplemental materials that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the interdot spacing and @xmath47 is the characteristic distance between the qubit and the charge fluctuators that cause @xmath38 . in the supplemental materials we also estimate that @xmath48 in the devices used for recent experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath46 can always be made smaller through engineering ( i.e. , reducing the interdot spacing by reducing the lithographic feature size ) , which is a key feature because it provides a straightforward path for systematically improving the qubit fidelity in the presence of charge noise .    the hamiltonian @xmath30 has four independently tunable parameters . </S>",

    "<S> the magnitudes of the local overhauser fields on dots 1 and 3 should be equalized for @xmath114-@xmath115 qubits , to enforce the symmetry requirements and suppress leakage out of the logical subspace . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a different type of symmetric sweet spot was recently employed for a singlet - triplet qubit in a double - dot geometry  @xcite . in those experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the resonant pulse was applied to the tunnel coupling , as suggested in ref  , while the detuning parameter was set to a sweet spot . </S>",
    "<S> three - electron logical spins , such as the quantum dot hybrid  @xcite or exchange - only  @xcite qubits , can also be implemented using a quadrupolar triple dot . in this case , we consider the charging transitions @xmath119-@xmath120 , @xmath119-@xmath121 , or @xmath122-@xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> when the qubit basis involves singlet - like and triplet - like spin states  @xcite , localized in dots 1 or 3 [ e.g. , at the @xmath119-@xmath120 transition ] , the @xmath114-@xmath115 splittings in those dots should be equalized . </S>",
    "<S> we note that measuring exchange - only qubits , or performing capacitive two - qubit gate operations , requires accessing the charge sector of these devices . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional charging transition used for this purpose is @xmath119-@xmath123@xcite , which is not protected from @xmath38 fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> a symmetric quadrupolar geometry could therefore benefit such operations .    </S>",
    "<S> two main types of couplings have been proposed to mediate two - qubit gates in quantum dot qubits : classical electrostatic ( capacitive ) interactions  @xcite and quantum exchange interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider capacitive couplings here , since exchange couplings require the dots to be in very close proximity . </S>",
    "<S> capacitive couplings based on qubit proximity , or floating top gates@xcite , are convenient for quadrupole qubits , provided that the tuning symmetries are preserved during gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the couplings should occur through the gates above the middle dots . </S>",

    "<S> qubit - resonator coupling strengths @xmath4 of up to @xmath124 - 50  mhz have been reported for cavity quantum electrodynamic ( cqed ) systems employing cd qubits  @xcite . however , the desired strong coupling limit has remained elusive@xcite , due to short cd coherence times of order 1  ns . achieving strong </S>",
    "<S> coupling requires that both @xmath125 and @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the main decoherence rate for the qubit , and @xmath128 is the decoherence rate for the superconducting stripline . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that @xmath4 for cq qubits should be similar to cd qubits , while @xmath129 should be reduced by a factor of @xmath13010 , so @xmath131 should increase by a factor of @xmath13010 , which would be sufficient to achieve strong coupling </S>",
    "<S> . it should also be possible to couple microwave striplines to quadrupolar spin qubits , using spin - to - charge conversion@xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that charge qubit dephasing can be suppressed by employing a quadrupole geometry , because the quadrupolar detuning fluctuations are much weaker than dipolar fluctuations . on the other hand , the quadrupolar detuning parameter @xmath28 can readily be controlled via voltages applied to top gates , and we expect gate times to be as fast for quadrupolar ( cq ) as for dipolar ( cd ) qubits . since dephasing is suppressed for cq qubits , while the gate times are unchanged , the resulting gate fidelities should be much higher than cd qubits . </S>",
    "<S> this is a promising result for charge qubits because the fidelities of both pulsed  @xcite and resonant  @xcite gating schemes are not currently high enough to enable useful error correction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have shown that the coherence properties of cq qubits improve as the device dimensions shrink , and we expect future generations of small cq qubits to achieve very high gate fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that logical spin qubits in quantum dots could benefit from a quadrupole geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a prominent application for quadrupolar qubits to be cqed , where improvements in coherence properties could lead to strong coupling . </S>"
