    "[ sec::recall ]      roughly speaking operad is a way to define a type , or a variety , of ( linear ) algebraic systems .",
    "an operad @xmath9 consists of a collection ( or a disjoint union ) of sets ( vector spaces ) @xmath54 of all multilinear operations ( numbered by the amount of inputs ) and composition rules @xmath55 which prescribe how one can substitute the @xmath32-th input of an operation by the result of another one .",
    "one typically separates two versions of this notion ( the so - called symmetric and non - symmetric operads ) depending on whether we allow and do not allow to permute the inputs of operations .",
    "the permutations of inputs define the action of symmetric groups on operations and compositions , hence , the direct computations becomes much harder in the symmetric case . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetric operads are much more important for applications .",
    "the general theory of non - symmetric operads is similar but more transparent , since one needs not take care of the symmetric group action .    given a discrete set @xmath56 of ( abstract ) multilinear operations , where @xmath57 consists of the @xmath4-ary operations , one can define the _ free _",

    "note that in the symmetric case a ` composition ' may permute the inputs , so that the set of @xmath4-ary generators @xmath62 should span a representation of the symmetric group . to separate the non - symmetric and symmetric cases",
    ", we will denote the corresponding free operads by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , using script and calligraphic fonts .",
    "each operad can be defined in terms of generators and relations .",
    "therefore , each operad may be considered as a quotient of a free operad .",
    "that is why we first describe linear bases in the free operads ( referred to as _ monomial bases _ ) which are compatible with compositions of operations .",
    "the difference between the symmetric and the non - symmetric cases is large already on this level .",
    "namely , the definition of monomial basis for non - symmetric operads is natural whereas to define monomials for symmetric operads we need an additional structure of shuffle operads introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we hope that the definitions and combinatorics of non - symmetric and shuffle monomials will be clear from the forthcoming subsections .",

    "all other edges ( having vertices at both sides ) are called _ internal_. each tree has one outgoing external edge (= the _ output _ or the _ root _ ) and several ingoing external edges , called _ leaves _ or _ inputs_. the number of leaves of a tree @xmath66 is called an _ arity _ of a tree and is denoted by @xmath67 .    consider the set of generators @xmath56 of the free operad @xmath63 .",
    "we mark a tree with a single vertex and @xmath4 incoming edges by an arbitrary element of @xmath62 and we call such tree a _ corolla_.",
    "we say that a rooted tree @xmath65 _ is internally labeled _ by the set @xmath59 if each vertex is labeled by an element from @xmath59 such that the number of inputs in this vertex coincide with the arity of corresponding operation .",
    "a rooted tree is called _ planar _ if for each vertex there is an ordering of all incoming edges .",
    "( therefore , there is a canonical way to project a tree on a plane . )",
    "[ lem::basis_in_nonsym ] a canonical basis of a free non - symmetric operad @xmath63 is enumerated by the set @xmath68 of all planar rooted trees internally labeled by the elements of the set @xmath59 .",
    "we shall refer to the elements of this basis as _ planar tree monomials_.",
    "r2.2 in     [ pic::nonsym::tree ]    there are two standard ways to think of elements of an operad in terms of its generators . the first way in terms of tree monomials represented by planar trees and the second one is in terms of compositions of operations presented by formulas with brackets .",
    "our approach is somewhere in the middle : in most cases , we prefer ( and strongly encourage the reader ) to think of tree monomials , but to write formulas required for definitions and proofs in the language of operations since it makes things more compact .",
    "a particular example of a planar tree monomial is presented in figure  [ pic::nonsym::tree ] .",
    "the corresponding operation may be written in a following way @xmath69 .",

    "the way to avoid this problem is to construct a basis compatible with _ some _ compositions . a class of compositions we would like to preserve",

    "the elements of the basis will be called _ shuffle monomials_.",
    "the main difference from the non - symmetric world is that one should have an external labeling of an operation ( i.e. , inputs should be ordered ) .",

    "thus we see that the shuffle monomial @xmath90 is divisible by @xmath91    let us define two particular cases of divisibility .",

    ", we assume that the described class of formal power series should be closed under the operation which sends @xmath354 to @xmath742    note that while the generating series of @xmath743 and @xmath744 are not rational nor algebraic , both these series satisfy simple first - order differential equations . in particular ,",
    "these functions are differential algebraic . in view of the consideration",
    "above , we state the following claim .      as for",
    "the ordinary generating series of non - symmetric operads ( i.e. , the exponential generating series of symmetric operads which are symmetrizations of the non - symmetric ones ) , the class of such general functions should include , at least , the above generating function of @xmath168 , polynomials over nonnegative integers ( for finite dimensional operads ) and formal power series which are roots of some polynomials with integer coefficients ( for free operads ) .",
    "in particular , such generating series are algebraic , that is , they satisfy some non - trivial algebraic equations over @xmath745 $ ] .",
    "suppose that the sequence of dimensions @xmath21 of components of an operad has slow growth ( e.g. , @xmath21 is bounded by some polynomial of @xmath4 ) .",
    "then in many examples the ordinary generating series @xmath746 of the operad @xmath5 is quite simple .",
    "for example , the operad @xmath743 has a rational generating series : @xmath747 such examples suggest the following claim .        to support our claims ,",
    "we consider operads with finite grbner bases of relations .",
    "the analogy with the theory of associative algebras leads us to expect that the generating series of operads with finite grbner bases are in our class .",
    "this expectation is suggested by the results of this article .",
    "[ conj::pbw ] let @xmath5 be a symmetric operad generated by binary operations and with quadratic relations that form a grbner basis according to one of the admissible orderings of shuffle monomials .",
    "then there exists a monomial shuffle regular operad @xmath749 with the same dimensions of operations ( @xmath750 for all @xmath4 ) .",
    "why this conjecture might be true ?",
    "the most important assumption is that the operad @xmath5 is symmetric .",
    "therefore , one should use the representation theory of the permutation groups @xmath751 .",
    "first , using the upper - triangular change of basis one can choose the set of generators @xmath59 of an operad @xmath5 such that the transposition element @xmath752 preserves this set .",
    "this means that @xmath753 @xmath754 where @xmath755 .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that @xmath756 for all @xmath757 .",
    "for any given pair of generators @xmath758 the set of all operations of the form @xmath759 form a 3-dimensional representation of @xmath760 which is the induction from a one - dimensional @xmath761-representation . therefore",
    ", it decomposes into the sum of one - dimensional and 2-dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "relations for the 2-dimensional representation looks as follows @xmath762 relations for the one - dimensional representation looks as follows : @xmath763 on the other hand , there are two shuffle regular sets of quadratic monomials : @xmath764 the hope is that the monomial operad @xmath749 can be constructed by taking the leading term @xmath765 of the relations that nontrivially projects on corresponding one - dimensional @xmath760-irreducible subspace and the set @xmath766 for those relations which projects on the two - dimensional @xmath760-irreducible subspace .",
    "the symmetric quotient operads of the operad @xmath168 ( i.e. , the operads corresponding to the varieties of associative algebras with polynomial identities ; called here _ associative operads _ ) form , probably , the widest extensively classified and studied class of operads . note that the traditional terminology for these operads differs from the one we use .",
    "particularly , the dimensions @xmath21 of an associative operad @xmath5 are usually referred to as _ codimensions _ of the corresponding varieties of algebras with polynomial identities ; the exponential and the usual generating series of the operad are referred as _ the codimension series _ and _ the exponential codimension series _ of the corresponding variety .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite . )",
    "we do not know whether each symmetric quotient operad of @xmath168 has a finite grbner basis . on the other hand",
    ", one can construct examples of _ shuffle _ monomial quotients of @xmath168 which are infinitely presented , that is , which have no finite grbner basis , at least with the standard choice of generators .",
    "however , the following properties of generating series of associative operads are close to the properties of our operads with finite shuffle regular grbner bases .",
    "firstly , in many cases the dimensions @xmath767 for such an operad @xmath5 can be calculated explicitly ( see  @xcite ) . in such cases ,",
    "these dimensions are presented as linear combinations of integer exponents of @xmath4 with polynomial coefficients . in particular , the corresponding exponential generating functions are differential algebraic , that is , they satisfy the conclusion of our corollary  [ cor::main_cor ] .",
    "secondly , the only non - symmetric associative operads are the finite - dimensional ones defined by the identity @xmath768 ( operads of nilpotent associative algebras ) ; obviously , the generating series of such operads do satisfy the conclusions of our theorem  [ th - nonsym ] and corollary  [ cor::nonsym_constant_growth ] .",
    "thirdly , the sequence of dimensions of an associative operad has either polynomial or exponential growth ( by the results of regev and kemer , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems  4.2.4 and  7.2.2 ) ) .",
    "this fact is similar to our corollary  [ cor::sym_constant_growth ] .",
    "after these observations , we think that our corollary  [ cor::main_cor ] ( which suggests expectation  [ main_thesys ] ) holds in a more general situation , that is , for a wider class of symmetric operads containing both operads with a finite shuffle regular grbner basis and associative operads .",
    "note that the two languages of universal algebra ( based on varieties vs the operads ) are equivalent provided that the basic field @xmath196 has zero characteristic . in this case , our conjecture  [ conj::assoc_general ] is equivalent to the following : _ the exponential codimension series of each variety of pi algebras is differential algebraic_.    a stronger version of conjecture  [ conj::assoc_general ] holds for associative operads of polynomial growth , that is , their ordinary generating series are rational  ( * ? ? ?",
    ". however , for some natural associative operads ( e.g. , for the operad defined by the identities of @xmath769 matrices ) the ordinary generating series are not rational  @xcite .",
    "this means that the conclusion of our  corollary  [ cor::sym_constant_growth ] does not hold for general associative operad .",
    "in particular , this means that some associative operads have no finite shuffle regular grbner basis ( whereas they are always finitely presented , by the kemer s famous solution of the specht problem  @xcite ) .",
    "this means also that some associative operads are not generic in the sense of our expectation  [ thesys_subexp ] .",
    "it would be interesting to find a closer class of formal power series than the class of differential algebraic ones which include all ( exponential ) generating series of generic symmetric operads .",
    "for the operads with a finite shuffle regular grbner basis , we propose the following approach .",
    "let us define a binary operation on @xmath770 $ ] by @xmath771 , where @xmath772 is defined in  ( [ eq::c(f , g ) ] ) . recall that the multiple operation @xmath101 from equation  ( [ eq::c(1 .. n ) ] ) is also defined via this binary operation : @xmath773 .",
