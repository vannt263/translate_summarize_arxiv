    "the classical vandermonde decomposition result discovered by carathodory and fejr in 1911 @xcite states that , if an @xmath1 hermitian toeplitz matrix @xmath2 is positive semidefinite ( psd ) and has rank @xmath3 , then it can be factorized as where @xmath4 is an @xmath5 positive definite diagonal matrix and @xmath6 is an @xmath7 vandermonde matrix whose columns correspond to uniformly sampled complex sinusoids with different frequencies . moreover , the decomposition is unique if @xmath8 . in the theory of moments ,",
    "the vandermonde decomposition provides a solution to the truncated trigonometric moment problem ( a.k.a .",
    "the moment problem on the unit circle given a finite moment sequence ) @xcite .",
    "it is also important in operator theory and has application in system theory @xcite .",
    "it has become important in the area of data analysis and signal processing since the 1970s when it was rediscovered by pisarenko and used for frequency retrieval from the data covariance matrix @xcite . from then on , the vandermonde decomposition has formed the basis of a prominent subset of methods for frequency estimation designated as subspace methods , e.g. , multiple signal classification ( music ) and estimation of parameters by rotational invariant techniques ( esprit ) ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "the new interest in vandermonde decomposition of toeplitz matrices has recently been evoked due to the spectral super - resolution and continuous compressed sensing framework , in which the frequency estimation problem is solved by exploiting sparsity , which arises from the fact that the number of frequencies is small , and optimization methods are formulated based on the vandermonde decomposition @xcite .",
    "concretely , the atomic norm @xcite , which is a continuous analog of the @xmath9 norm utilized in previous compressed sensing based methods @xcite , is used and cast as semidefinite programming ( sdp ) by applying the vandermonde decomposition .",
    "the atomic norm method is superior in the sense that , unlike the compressed sensing methods , it does not require to grid / discretize the frequency domain , completely resolves the grid mismatch problem , and provides strong theoretical guarantees .",
    "the vandermonde decomposition has also been generalized to high dimensions and used for multidimensional frequency estimation @xcite .",
    "we note that the frequencies in the vandermonde decomposition in may take any value in the normalized frequency domain @xmath10 in which the starting point 0 and the ending point 1 are identified . in this paper , we ask the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ can the frequencies in the vandermonde decomposition of @xmath2 be restricted to lie in a given interval @xmath11 , instead of the entire domain @xmath10 , under explicit conditions on @xmath2 ?",

    "for fs - anm the frequencies computed using the fs vandermonde decomposition have recovery errors on the order of @xmath291 while those computed using the root - finding method have errors on the order of @xmath292 .",
    "finally , we mention that the performance improvement in fig . [",
    "fig : canm ] is due to the correct choice of the interval @xmath12 .",
