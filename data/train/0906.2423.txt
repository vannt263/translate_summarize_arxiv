    "spin transfer torque describes the interaction between the spin of itinerant , current - carrying electrons and the spins of the equilibrium electrons which comprise the magnetization of a ferromagnet .",
    "this torque results from the spin - dependent exchange - correlation electron - electron interaction , and leads to the mutual precession of equilibrium and non - equilibrium spins around the total spin . in spin valves with sufficiently high current density ,",
    "spin transfer torque can excite a free ferromagnetic layer to irreversibly switch between two stable configurations ( typically along an easy - axis , parallel or anti - parallel to an applied magnetic field ) , or to undergo microwave oscillations .",
    "previous considerations of spin transfer torque mostly focus on the _ transverse _ response of the magnetization to spin currents @xcite .",
    "this is appropriate since the temperatures used in spin valve experiments are substantially below the curie temperature @xmath0 of the ferromagnets , so that longitudinal fluctuations can be ignored . near @xmath0 ,",
    "one expects an interplay between the large thermal fluctuations and the nonequilibrium spin transfer torque . generally speaking ,",
    "theories of critical phenomena in out - of - equilibrium systems have only recently been developed @xcite , and there remain many open questions on this topic .    even far from the curie temperature",
    ", temperature plays an important role in quantitatively analyzing the dependence of the magnetic orientation on the applied field and applied current .",
    "the effect of finite temperature on spin dynamics in the presence of spin transfer torque has been modeled the macrospin approximation ( fixed magnetization length ) by adding a slonczewski torque to the langevin equation describing the stochastic spin dynamics @xcite , and by solving the fokker - planck equation with the spin transfer torque term added to the deterministic dynamics @xcite . the keldysh formalism provides a formal derivation of the stochastic equation of motion @xcite for the non - equilibrium ( i.e. , current - carrying ) system for a single spin of fixed magnitude .",

    ", there is theoretical work which accounts for longitudinal fluctuations near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this formal treatment culminates in the construction of the landau - lifshitz - bloch equation ( llb ) , which is an extension of the familiar landau - lifshitz equation with an additional longitudinal degree of freedom . in this work ,",
    "we consider temperatures near the curie temperature and include both longitudinal fluctuations of the magnetization and the influence of spin transfer torque .",
    "there are a number of issues that complicate magnetic dynamics near @xmath0 , including the temperature dependence of more basic magnetic properties such as magnetic damping and magneto - crystalline anisotropy , as well as the temperature dependence of the spin transfer torque itself .",
    "we use an atomistic approach for the stochastic dynamics of a local moment ferromagnet with the inclusion of spin transfer torque .",
    "such a model is more appropriate for systems like the dilute magnetic semiconductor gamnas .",
    "our use of simple approximations for the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy , demagnetization field , and damping allow us to focus in the interplay between thermal fluctuations and spin transfer torque .",

    ", we verify the applicability of the llbs equation by comparing its results to the atomistic results .",
    "we then analyze the llbs equation to find the applied field - applied current phase diagram for different temperatures .",
    "we find that critical switching currents are reduced by the same mechanism exploited in heat assisted magnetic recording , namely the temperature - induced reduction in the magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "we also find that regions of the phase diagram which have been experimentally unattainable become relevant at high temperatures .",
    "the dependence of critical currents on temperature in these regions can provide quantitative details about the temperature dependence of spin transfer torque .",
    "to study the interplay between temperature and spin transfer torque , we consider a spin valve with a fixed layer magnetization in the @xmath1-direction with curie temperature @xmath2 , and a free layer with a smaller curie temperature @xmath3 ( see fig .",

    "this allows for a nearly temperature independent spin current flux incident on the free layer .",
    "we make the approximation that all of the incoming spin current is absorbed uniformly throughout the free layer magnetization .",
    "this approximation is based on two expectations .",
    "substantial spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in the magnetization should induce rather irregular spatial patterns in the spin currents carried by propagating states .",
    "this will lead to large dephasing effects , so that the total spin current should rapidly decay away from the interface as in the conventional picture of spin transfer torques@xcite .",
