    "there are many physical situations where diffusion takes place under the presence of traps , trapping diffusion .",
    "examples are found in electronic conduction in amorphous semiconductors and quasicrystals @xcite , atomic diffusion in glass like materials @xcite , tracer diffusion in living polymers @xcite , and more @xcite.the existence of traps is generally modeled through a probability density of waiting times between successive steps in the walk , continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "the theory of ctrw has been extensively developed in the literature , using the generating function methods @xcite or simple statistical reasoning @xcite .",
    "the existence of a wide distribution of waiting times leads to a subdiffusive regime where the mean squared displacement grows slower than time . on the other hand , there are physical situations where the time between successive jumps may be considered constant , but the distribution of jump distances is wide @xcite , ( lvy flights ) @xcite .",
    "lvy flights are also observed in a large variety of phenomena , for instance in chaotic dynamical systems @xcite , turbulent @xcite flow and self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of a wide distribution of jump distances leads to a superdiffusive regime , where the mean squared displacement grows faster than time .",
    "moreover , lvy flights generates fractal structures in space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , more complex behaviors are expected in systems where both the distribution of waiting times and jump distances are wide .",
    "for instance , schulz @xcite studied an anomalous drude model for transport properties of quasicrystals .",
    "he assumed that the walks move with an anomalous speed @xmath0 between collisions , and a power law @xmath1 distribution of time between collisions . in this way",
    ", he obtained the phase diagram ( @xmath2 ) of the system , which is divided in different regions .",
    "while the anomalous velocity may mimic the existence of traps , it is introduced artificially and can not be derived from a hamiltonian . in @xcite ,",
    "et al _ introduced a stochastic description of anomalous transport phenomena and found different behavior of the mean square displacement of ctrw .",
    "zumofen and klafter @xcite studied a one - dimensional map which exhibits intermittent chaotic behavior with coexisting laminar and localized phases , and analyzed them in terms of lvy statistics .",
    "a more consistent approach was presented by klafter and zumofen @xcite .",
    "they studied the diffusion in a hamiltonian system in terms of the ctrw formulation , and considered wide distributions of waiting times and jump distances .",
    "however , they did not provide a complete characterization of the different diffusion regimes that may be obtained .",
    "in a recent letter fogedby @xcite considered levy flights in the presence of a quenched isotropic random force field studying the interplay between the built in superdiffusive behavior of the levy flights and the pinning effect of the random environment .    in the present work we study the behavior of a random walk in the presence of traps .",
    "disorder is introduced in an annealed way , through power law distributions of waiting times @xmath3 and jump distances @xmath4 .",
    "we use simple statistical reasoning close to the approach developed by bouchaud and georges @xcite instead of that of the work by klafter and zumofen @xcite , which use the ctrw formulation .",
    "the present formalism contains as a fundamental tool the theory of lvy stable distributions , introduced by lvy @xcite and developed by other authors @xcite .",
    "we consider a random walk on a lattice , such that the particle has to wait for a time @xmath5 on each site before performing the next jump .",
    "the waiting time is a random variable independently chosen at each new jump according to a distribution @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume that the waiting time is not correlated to the length of the jump @xmath7 , which is distributed according to @xmath8 .",
    "the diffusion process will be characterized by the scattering function @xmath9 , the fourier transform of the diffusion front .",
    "other properties like the diffusion front and the mean squared displacement can be derived from this function .",
    "for instance , the mean squared displacement is given by @xmath10 let @xmath11 be the number of steps performed by a walker during time @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 is , in general , a random variable which depends on the duration of the jumps and waiting times .",
    "the scattering function can thus be expressed as a sum over all possible jumps during time @xmath12@xmath13 where @xmath9 is the scattering function of the same problem , but considering regular duration of the jumps and no waiting time and @xmath14 stands for the probability distribution of @xmath11 jumps at a fixed time @xmath12 .",
    "the total displacement after @xmath11 steps is given by @xmath15 in the right hand side we have a sum of mutually independent random variables with the common distribution @xmath8 , with zero mean .",
    "the limit distribution for large @xmath11 will be a stable lvy distribution @xcite , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes that random variables in both sides have the same distribution , @xmath18 is a characteristic value and @xmath19 follows the symmetric lvy distribution @xmath20 .",
    "the canonical ( fourier transform ) representation of lvy stable laws is ( for @xmath21 ) @xmath22(k)=\\exp \\biggl[-|k|^\\alpha \\biggl(1+\\frac k{|k|}i\\beta \\tan \\alpha \\frac \\pi 2\\biggr)\\biggr ] ,   \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are real numbers defined in the intervals @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponds with the gaussian distribution , which decays faster than any power law for large arguments . on the contrary , all lvy distributions , except the gaussian , have the asymptotic behavior for @xmath29 @xcite @xmath30 then , from eqs .",

    "in region i both the distribution of waiting times and jump distances have finite variance . hence , the random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 will follow a gaussian distribution . for large @xmath11 , we can therefore neglect the last two terms in the right hand side of eq .",

    "the relaxation becomes slower than an exponential .",

    "this is a consequence of the divergence of the second moment of the distribution of jump distances .",

    "( [ eq:12 ] ) . besides , the asymptotic behaviors for short and long times are the same , replacing @xmath62 by @xmath82 .",
    "the main difference is observed in the @xmath76-dependence of the relaxation time @xmath83 , which is manifested in the temporal dependence of the mean squared displacement , @xmath84 the difference between region va and vb is that , in the former the mean squared displacement grows faster than time and , therefore , the system is in a superdiffusive regime , while in the second one it grows slower than time and the system is in a subdiffusive regime . in region",
    "vc there is also a subdiffusive regime , which has been investigated by different authors , using the generating function formulation @xcite or simple statistical reasoning @xcite .",

    "this classification only takes into account the temporal dependence of the scattering function for short times , while the long time decay may be different .",
