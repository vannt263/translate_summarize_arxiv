    "in the context of quantum information theory , a distinct form of quantum resources corresponds to a specific _ restriction _ on the allowed quantum operations @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best known example along this line of thought is the quantum entanglement theory @xcite , where the restricted set of operations is called local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . to date , the theory of quantum entanglement has proven to be fruitful in various quantum information tasks @xcite and directly inspired other resource theories of purity @xcite , the degree of superpositions @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , quantum reference frames @xcite , and the asymmetry of quantum states @xcite",
    ". the complete characterization of a particular resource theory mainly consists of three aspects : ( i ) the unambiguous definition , ( ii ) the reasonable metrics , and ( iii ) the interconversions of quantum states under the predetermined restrictions .",
    "a recent successful application of quantum resource theory is the information - theoretic quantification of quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "proposed the basic notions of incoherent states , incoherent operations and a series of ( axiomatic ) necessary conditions any measure of coherence should satisfy . among all the potential metrics ,",
    "the measures based on the @xmath0 norm and quantum relative entropy are highlighted .",
    "this seminal work has triggered the community s interest in the definitions of other proper measures @xcite , the freezing phenomenon @xcite , the coherence transformations under incoherent operations @xcite , and some further developments @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that most of the related literatures have focused on a single qudit system and little attention has been paid to the bipartite or multipartite systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , the quantifications and classifications of quantum correlations in multipartite systems are far from being settled up to now @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we first establish the hierarchical relationship of different manifestations of quantum correlations , on the basis of quantum relative entropy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we pursue the answers to the following important issues :    @xmath1 what is the exact relationship between quantum coherence with other measures of quantum correlations , such as quantum entanglement or quantum discord ? here we introduce the notion of _ basis - free _ quantum coherence and prove this quantity is equivalent to quantum discord .",
    "this correspondence relation opens up a new way to interpret the interconversions between different measures of quantum correlations .",
    "@xmath1 by definition , quantum entanglement @xmath2 and discord @xmath3 remain invariant under product ( local ) unitary transformations , that is @xcite @xmath4 however , since quantum coherence is a _ basis - dependent _ quantity , even local unitary transformations ( let alone nonlocal operations ) can increase quantum coherence in bipartite systems .",
    "therefore , it is worth investigating the local and nonlocal unitary creation of quantum coherence .",
    "@xmath1 in multipartite systems , a natural question arises how the correlations in the total system are distributed among the distinct subsystems .",
    "for instance , we wonder whether the following relation holds for any tripartite state @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a proper measure of quantum coherence .",
    "to characterize quantum coherence as a physical resource , we first need to identify the definitions of incoherent states and incoherent operations @xcite . in an @xmath8-partite system",
    ", the incoherent states can be represented as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a _ pre - fixed _",
    "local basis of the @xmath12th subsystem . according to the assumption on whether the measurement outcomes are recorded or not , the incoherent completely positive and trace preserving ( icptp ) quantum operations are categorized into the following two classes @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 _ the non - selective icptp maps : _ @xmath13 where the incoherent kraus operators fulfill the constraints @xmath14 and @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the whole set of incoherent states .",
    "@xmath1 _ the selective icptp maps : _ these operations distinguish themselves from the above class by recording the measurement results , i.e. , the post - measurement state corresponding to the outcome @xmath16 and its probability of occurrence are given by @xmath18.\\ ] ]    equipped with the above - mentioned theoretical definitions , baumgratz _ et al .",

    "_ introduced the measures of coherence based on @xmath0 norm and quantum relative entropy @xcite while girolami proposed another one by resort to the skew information @xcite .",
    "however , recently du _ et al .",
    "_ argued that the measure of coherence based on the skew information is probably more applicable as a measure of asymmetry of quantum states @xcite . in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on the relative entropy of coherence @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the diagonal version of @xmath28 , which only retains the diagonal elements of @xmath28 .    before moving forward",
    ", it is interesting to take a closer look at the incoherent kraus operators , which play an essential role in the definition of incoherent operations .",
    "indeed , the requirement @xmath29 ( here we omit the subscript @xmath16 for simplicity ) is a rather strong constraint on the operator @xmath30 .",
    "the following theorem tells us that the structure or configuration of @xmath30 is highly restricted .",
    "there exists at most one nonzero entry in every column of the incoherent kraus operator @xmath30 .",
    "[ t1 ]    _ proof .",
    "_ the constraint @xmath29 indicates that the incoherent kraus operator @xmath30 maps an _ arbitrary _ incoherent state @xmath31 to an incoherent state @xmath32 .",
    "let us denote the elements of the matrix @xmath30 as @xmath33_{ij}=k_{ij}$ ] .",
    "similarly we can also represent the incoherent state @xmath31 as @xmath34_{ij}=a_i\\delta_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath35 are the diagonal entries of @xmath31 and @xmath36 is the kronecker delta .",
    "therefore , adopting the einstein s convention , we have @xmath37_{ij}[\\delta_a]_{jl}[k^{\\dagger}]_{lm}&=k_{ij}a_j\\delta_{jl}k^\\ast_{ml } = a_jk_{ij}k^\\ast_{mj}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by use of @xmath38_{ij}=b_i\\delta_{ij}$ ] , further we obtain @xmath39 note that when @xmath40 , the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ summation ] ) equals zero and the _ arbitrariness _ of @xmath31 ( thus @xmath41 ) participates at this stage .",
    "if we choose the vector @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 which exactly implies that there exists at most one nonzero entry in the _ first _ column of @xmath30 .",
    "the same reasoning can be easily generalized to other columns by a proper choice of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath44    from theorem [ t1 ] , we can directly obtain the following useful corollary .    if the incoherent kraus operator @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denote the @xmath47 by @xmath48 matrices , then the number of possible structure of @xmath30 is @xmath49 . here",
    "a legal structure stands for a possible arrangement of nonzero entries in the matrix .",
    "for example , as for @xmath50 or @xmath51 incoherent kraus operators , the number of possible structure is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which easily recovers the result in ref . @xcite .",
    "from geometric point of view , any distance measure between quantum states may serve as a candidate for quantifying different forms of quantum correlations .",
    "a significant example is the usage of quantum relative entropy in quantum information theory @xcite . in particular ,",
    "first proposed the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite while the relative entropy of discord was first introduced by modi _",
    "_ @xcite . compared with the relative entropy of coherence",
    ", one can list the following definitions @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 stand for the sets of separable states and classically correlated states @xcite , respectively .",
    "since the incoherent states are diagonal states defined in a pre - determined orthogonal basis , the inclusion of sets clearly appears @xmath57 therefore , we are led to the following hierarchical relations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xmath58 which signifies that quantum coherence is a far more ubiquitous manifestation of quantum correlations .",
    "on the other hand , it is worth emphasizing again that quantum coherence is a _ basis - dependent _ quantity .",
    "this pre - determined orthogonal basis @xmath59 is a crucial premise when we refer to its computation or manipulation .",
    "however , under some circumstances we are more inclined to deal with a _ basis - independent _ quantity",
    ". then a natural question arises whether such a measure of quantum coherence can be defined . here",
    "we first propose a basis - free measure of coherence by the minimization over all local unitary transformations @xmath60 where @xmath61 possesses a local product structure .",
    "the next theorem tells us that this quantity is _ exactly _ equivalent to the relative entropy of discord .    the basis - free quantum coherence @xmath62 is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "_ with respect to a given basis @xmath64 , the diagonal state @xmath27 can be represented as the completely decohered state of @xmath28 @xmath65 using this expression , we have @xmath66 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\min_{\\mathcal{b}(\\vec{k})=\\vec{u}^\\dagger|\\vec{k}\\rangle}s\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{k}}\\langle\\mathcal{b}(\\vec{k})|\\rho|\\mathcal{b}(\\vec{k})\\rangle|\\vec{k}\\rangle\\langle\\vec{k}|\\right)-s(\\rho ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\min_{\\mathcal{b}(\\vec{k})}h\\left(\\{|\\mathcal{b}(\\vec{k})\\rangle\\}\\right)-s(\\rho ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\mathcal{d}(\\rho),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is a local orthogonal basis and @xmath68 .",
    "in the derivation we have used the unitary invariance of von neumann entropy and the results in ref .",
    "@xmath44    this one - to - one correspondence builds a new bridge between quantum coherence and other forms of correlations and opens up a new way to interpret the physical phenomena of quantum coherence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "for example ,    @xmath1 it has been pointed out that nonclassical multipartite correlations ( relative entropy of discord ) can be activated into distillable bipartite entanglement @xcite . from the corresponding relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , it is reasonable to conjecture that quantum coherence can also be considered as a resource for entanglement creation and recently streltsov _ et al . _",
    "have proved it is the case @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 for quantum discord , a freezing phenomenon occurs under certain initial conditions , especially when the underlying system is subject to the environmental noise @xcite . from the equivalence relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", the same phenomenon may appear for quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "in fact , cianciaruso _ et al . _ have demonstrated that the freezing phenomenon of geometric quantum correlations is independent of the adopted distance measure and thus universal @xcite .",
    "from the definition of @xmath62 and its equivalence to the relative entropy of discord , we can easily find that quantum coherence can be created by local ( and nonlocal ) unitary transformations . in this section ,",
    "we concentrate on the creation of quantum coherence in the context of two - qubit unitary gates .",
    "more precisely , we aim to evaluate the optimal creation of coherence under specified types of unitary operators for a _ given _ incoherent state , that is @xmath69 where @xmath70 in the computational basis @xmath71 and @xmath72 may be faced with some restrictions on its structure .",
    "without loss of generality , we can arrange @xmath73 in ascending order ( that is , @xmath74 ) . in the following , we mainly focus on three different types of two - qubit gates .",
    "@xmath1 _ one - side unitary operator @xmath75_. using again the unitary invariance of von neumann entropy , @xmath76 can be rewritten as @xmath77 where @xmath78 . from eq .",
    "( [ copt ] ) , we only need to evaluate the four diagonal entries of @xmath28 . in the meantime , we can parametrize the general one - qubit unitary operator as @xmath79 where @xmath80 . note that in fact the overall phase @xmath81 is irrelevant in our discussion , so we set @xmath82 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we only present the four diagonal elements @xmath83 of @xmath84 @xmath85    remarkably , the effective role of @xmath75 is a _ mixture _ of the diagonal elements of @xmath86 . to find the optimal value @xmath76",
    ", we define the entropy function @xmath87 .",
    "after simplification , the first derivative of @xmath88 is @xmath89 with this expression and the ordering @xmath90 , it is evident that the function @xmath88 is monotonically increasing for @xmath91 $ ] , while it is monotonically decreasing for @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "therefore , when @xmath93 we arrive at the optimal value @xmath94 in order to distinguish it from the hadamard gate @xmath95 @xcite , we denote the optimal one - qubit unitary operator as ( up to a global phase ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath1 _ two - side unitary operator @xmath98_. following a similar procedure , we first parametrize the one - qubit unitary operators @xmath99 where @xmath100 . here",
    "we also provide the four diagonal entries of @xmath101 @xmath102    intriguingly , now the effective role of @xmath98 is a more thorough mixing of the diagonal elements of @xmath86 . instead of carrying out a similar analysis as in the first case , we can obtain the optimal value intuitively by noting that @xmath103 for all @xmath28 . therefore , if @xmath104 , we get the optimal value @xmath105 where the constraint @xmath106 is applied . by the concavity of function @xmath107 ,",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath108 , which means the two - side local unitary operator performs better in the creation of coherence .",
    "moveover , the optimal unitary operator is @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath1 _ the kernel of nonlocal unitary operator @xmath110_. in fact , any two - qubit unitary gate can be decomposed in cartan form @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are single - qubit unitary operators and the bipartite nonlocal unitary _ kernel _",
    "@xmath110 has the form @xmath116 here @xmath117 are standard pauli operators and @xmath118 is a real vector satisfying @xcite @xmath119    indeed , we should point out that coherence creation under arbitrary two - qubit gate can not be reduced to the problem where only @xmath110 is taken into consideration , since we have already demonstrated that quantum coherence can be increased by local product unitary operators .",
    "however , compared with the two previous cases , it is of significance to investigate the effect of the nonlocal kernel separately . for clarity",
    ", we present the detailed discussion and some further expansion in the appendix and the optimal @xmath110 is the kernel of the cnot gate @xcite @xmath120 the corresponding optimal value is @xmath121 from the concavity of von neumann entropy and the majorization theory @xcite , we have the ordering @xmath122 which implies that the nonlocal kernel alone does not necessarily outperform the local product unitary operators concerning the creation of coherence .    to intuitively understand the physics behind these results , we notice the effect of the gate @xmath123 @xmath124 that is , @xmath123 transforms the computational basis states into the _ maximally coherent states _ @xcite .",
    "more generally , if we apply @xmath125 on @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 which is a @xmath128-dimensional maximally coherent states . in this particular sense , @xmath123 ( or the hadamard gate @xmath95 )",
    "can be regarded as a _ maximally coherent operator_. in contrast , the cnot gate is more inclined to create entanglement by noting that @xmath129 which indicates that the nonlocal kernel of the cnot gate transforms a fully separable basis into a maximally entangled basis @xcite . in fact , an arbitrary ( two - qubit ) incoherent states @xmath86 can be converted to a _ bell - diagonal - like _ state by the cnot gate .",
    "in this section , we discuss the additivity relation of quantum coherence in the tripartite scenario . here",
    "the _ additivity relation _ describes how quantum coherence is distributed among the subsystems @xcite .",
    "in particular , we wonder whether the tripartite coherence is equal to or greater than the sum of the bipartite coherences , that is , whether the following inequality holds or not @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "first , we present two important class of states which are in favor of the inequality ( [ add - relation ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 _ the generalized ghz states @xmath133_. in the computational basis , it is easy to verify that @xmath134 and @xmath135 . thus the inequality ( [ add - relation ] ) holds in this case .",
    "@xmath1 _ the generalized w states @xmath136_. in the computational basis , we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the diagonal version of @xmath139 . similarly , we also obtain @xmath140 therefore , we have the inequality @xmath141 to see this point , for a given @xmath142 , we define the function @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath146 is a _ convex _",
    "function when @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath146 is reached at the boundary , that is , @xmath148 or @xmath149 .",
    "the above evidences immediately tempt one to conjecture that the inequality ( [ add - relation ] ) holds for any tripartite systems . before attempting to construct or search a counterexample by numerical simulation",
    ", the next theorem confirms that this conjecture is invalid by providing a rather interesting class of states .",
    "there exists a class of states violating the additivity relation ( [ add - relation ] ) , which satisfies strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy with equality .",

    "@xmath44    in fact , hayden _",

    "theorem [ t3 ] tells us that the additivity relation in multipartite systems is also closely related to the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy .",
    "in this work , we have systematically studied the quantum coherence in multipartite systems , employing the quantum relative entropy as a distance measure .",
    "first , we characterize the structure of the incoherent kraus operators , which is a key ingredient in formulating the incoherent operations . toward a unified view",
    ", we present the hierarchical structure of quantum coherence , quantum discord and quantum entanglement in multipartite systems . remarkably , we propose the concept of basis - free quantum coherence and prove that this quantity is exactly equivalent to the quantum discord .",
    "this one - to - one correspondence offers us a new way to look at the interconversions between different types of quantum correlations .",
    "moreover , we analytically evaluate the optimal creations of quantum coherence for specific two - qubit unitary gates and the roles of the hadamard - like gate @xmath123 and cnot gate are highlighted .",
    "finally , we explicitly figure out the intrinsic connection between the additivity relation and the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy .    within the framework of this work ,",
    "there are several open questions to be addressed .",
    "( i ) a detailed analysis of the coherent power ( capacity ) of unitary operations is still missing ( see the definition and discussion in the appendix ) .",
    "this aspect is of both theoretical and applied significance , since the creation and maintenance of quantum coherence are a central problem in quantum communication and computation @xcite ; ( ii ) similar to the additivity relation discussed in this work , it is well know that the monogamy or polygamy relations exist for quantum entanglement and discord @xcite .",
    "for instance , we may check whether the following inequality holds for any tripartite states , in the spirit of the seminal work by coffman _",
    "@xcite @xmath161 here the crux of this problem is how to appropriately define the quantum coherence for a bipartite partition .",

    "<S> within the unified framework of exploiting the relative entropy as a distance measure of quantum correlations , we make explicit the hierarchical structure of quantum coherence , quantum discord and quantum entanglement in multipartite systems . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a new measure of quantum coherence , the _ basis - free _ quantum coherence and prove that this quantity is exactly equivalent to quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the original relative entropy of coherence is a basis - dependent quantity , we investigate the local and nonlocal unitary creation of quantum coherence , focusing on the two - qubit unitary gates . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , our results demonstrate that nonlocal unitary gates do not necessarily outperform the local unitary gates . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the additivity relationship of quantum coherence in tripartite systems is discussed in detail , where the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy plays an essential role . </S>"
