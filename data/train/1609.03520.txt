    "a complete census of stars within the solar neighbourhood out to a specified distance will inform us about the stellar mass function , star formation , and the kinematics of the galaxy and of young , nearby clusters and moving groups . the main difficulty in constructing a volume - limited sample is identification of nearby , low - mass objects because of their low luminosity .",
    "also , accurate distance measurements for these stars are not easy to obtain .",
    "the most powerful method for identifying potential nearby stars comes from pm surveys .",
    "pm surveys continually improve , as longer time baselines increase the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "a uniform census of nearby stars allows characterisation of the relative occurrence rates of different types of stars , and allows relationships between intrinsic properties of those stars , including absolute magnitude and colour , to be examined .",
    "the first attempts at large surveys for high proper - motion ( hpm ) stars began in the early 20th century with works by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , additional surveys were completed : e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the first all - sky search exploiting these initial photographic surveys for nearby stars was by luyten , who published two pm catalogues : the luyten half - second catalogue ( lhs : * ? ? ? * ) , and the new luyten two - tenths catalogue ( nltt : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    after these early works many papers concerning proper motion studies were published .",
    "@xcite compiled a list of 61977 stars in the northern hemisphere with @xmath2 arcsec yr@xmath3 , identifying over 90% of those stars down to a limiting magnitude of v@xmath419.0 , excluding the galactic plane , and southern hemisphere ( @xcite , @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of 182 southern stars ( @xmath6 ) with proper motion @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of 152 new high proper motion systems ( @xmath8 ) in the southern sky ( @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) brighter than ukst plate @xmath11 via their supercosmos - recons ( scr ) search .",
    "@xcite , completing their superblink proper motion survey in the southern celestial hemisphere , found 170 additional new stars with proper motions @xmath7 .",
    "this final part of their search covers 11,600 deg@xmath12 in the declination range @xmath13 and in low galactic latitude areas south of @xmath14 = -30@xmath15 which had not been covered in earlier data releases .",
    "most of the new discoveries were found in densely populated fields along the milky way , toward the galactic bulge / center .",
    "their total list of high proper motion stars recovered by superblink in the southern sky contains 2228 stars with proper motions @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite , as a continuation of the scr search in the southern sky , presented 2817 new southern proper motion systems with @xmath16 and declinations between @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite published 1584 new southern proper motion systems with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this search complemented the six previous scr searches of the southern sky for stars within the pm motion range , but shallower than @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite published an all - sky catalogue of m - dwarfs with apparent infrared ( ir ) magnitude @xmath21 .",
    "the 8889 stars were selected from the on - going superblink survey of stars with @xmath22  mas yr@xmath3 , supplemented on the bright end with the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "completeness tests suggest that this catalogue represents @xmath2375% of the estimated @xmath2311900 m - dwarfs with @xmath21 expected for the entire sky .",
    "this catalogue is , however , significantly more complete for the northern sky ( @xmath490% ) than it is for the south ( @xmath460% ) .",
    "@xcite presented a spectroscopic catalogue of 70841 visually inspected m - dwarfs from the seventh release of the sloan digital sky survey . recently ,",
    "@xcite , again using the superblink pm survey , reported a catalogue of @xmath23200,000 m - dwarfs in the northern sky .",
    "they presented a new census of @xmath23100,000 m - dwarfs located within 100 pc .",
    "the new census is 95% complete to 50 pc , and @xmath2475% complete to 100  pc .",
    "it was followed by the spectroscopic catalogue of the brightest ( @xmath25@xmath269 ) m dwarf candidates in the northern sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the position and proper motion extended - l ( ppmxl ) catalogue @xcite and applied optical and near - ir colour cuts together with a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) cut to find bright m - dwarfs for future exoplanet transit studies .",
    "recently , @xcite presented two new infrared pm catalogues based on the ukidss large area survey and galactic plane survey .",
    "@xcite used multi - epoch astrometry from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) to identify 762 high proper motion objects , 761 of which were detected also by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "@xcite , using the allwise processing pipeline , have measured motions for all objects detected on wise images taken between 2010 january and 2011 february .",
    "they found 22445 objects that have significant allwise motions , of which 3525 have motions that can be independently confirmed from earlier 2mass images , yet lack any published motions in simbad .",
    "m - dwarfs are the most abundant inhabitants of our galaxy and also are probably the most common sites of planet formation @xcite",
    ". they account for over 70% of stellar systems in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "in addition , the single star fraction  a crucial statistic for giant planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * )  decreases from @xmath2360 - 70% for m - dwarfs to @xmath2354% for solar - type stars to near 0% for the most massive stars @xcite , further separating m - dwarfs from afgk stars as the most numerous potential planet hosts of all the stellar classes @xcite . about 25% of all doppler - confirmed planets with @xmath27  @xmath28 are orbiting m - dwarfs .",
    "large exoplanet surveys have now started to monitor sizable numbers of m - dwarfs , such as the m2k program which is targeting some 1600 m - dwarfs for radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring @xcite and the mearth project @xcite which is designed to detect exoplanet transits in nearby late - type m - dwarfs .",
    "the principal methods of exoplanet detection , rv and transits , are both more sensitive to planets around stars of lower and substellar mass .",
    "the brightest m - dwarfs are the ideal ( highest priority ) targets for high precision rv searches , the latest m - dwarfs are the most suitable for transit surveys , and the youngest m - dwarfs are preferable targets for adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging .",
    "the above - mentioned factors make searches for new , nearby , and young low - mass stars and substellar objects highly valuable .",
    "all old optical surveys avoid or are at least substantially incomplete near to the galactic plane . in the subsection[sec : catalog ] we present a detailed comparison with previous pm studies covering the vvv area .",
    "there are two modern surveys that make an exception : the int photometric h@xmath29 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ) @xcite and the vst photometric h@xmath29 survey of the southern galactic plane and bulge ( vphas+ ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this region is still referred to as the `` zone of avoidance '' as it contains the highest stellar densities down to faint limiting magnitudes in addition to regions with dark molecular clouds , nebulosity , and current star formation , which produces substantial confusion .",
    "nevertheless , the galactic plane and the galactic bulge offer considerable latent potential for new discoveries of nearby low - mass stars and ultra - cool dwarfs ( ucds ) from deeper searches .",
    "such discoveries may contain young , unusual , and nearby / bright examples of these objects , and will also complement those made at higher galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "good recent examples of nearby ( @xmath2610 pc ) interesting discoveries at low galactic latitude are those of ugps  j0722 - 05 ( t9 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , denis  j081730.0 - 615520 ( t6.5 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the amazing discoveries of the nearest brown dwarfs wise  j104915.57 - 531906.1ab @xcite and wise  j085510.83 - 071442.5 @xcite at @xmath232  pc from the sun .",
    "these discoveries near to the galactic plane highlight the important serendipitous nature in which new ir surveys like vvv @xcite can improve on the incomplete solar neighbourhood census of low - mass stellar and sub - stellar systems .",
    "a positive aspect of the high stellar densities encountered in the galactic plane and bulge is the plethora of bright reference stars for good ao tip - tilt low - order correction .",
    "this will facilitate high - strehl imaging measurements to identify very low - mass brown dwarf / planetary - mass , companions for studying multiplicity , and also measuring dynamical masses .",
    "moreover , high - strehl ao studies of newly identified binary moving group members could also provide good age and composition constrains , as well as dynamical masses , enabling direct feed - back to evolutionary models .",
    "the crowded fields are also perfect for time series and astrometric studies because they provide many suitable reference stars .",
    "the vvv near - ir ( @xmath30 ) survey covers 562 deg@xmath31 of the galactic bulge and the southern galactic disk and provides accurate photometry , and multi - epoch @xmath1-band imaging , enabling us to discover a meaningful sample of new nearby cool and ultra - cool dwarfs ( ucds : spectral types @xmath24m6 ) with a higher completeness than has previously been achieved in the low southern galactic latitudes ( e.g. , from 2mass and deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) ) , from a pm search .",
    "the first study of the pm objects using vvv data was made by @xcite .",
    "the common proper motion method was used and seven new co - moving companions around known hpm stars were discovered . reported the discovery of the first vvv brown dwarf  vvvbd001  a new member of the 20 pc sample with well defined proper motion , distance , and luminosity . for our initial search",
    "we limited our sample selection to the brightest ( @xmath32 magnitude ) objects only .",
    "a more complete and deeper catalogue will be published later ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smith et al . , in prep ) .    here",
    "we present the first vvv hpm catalogue limited to @xmath33 using the vvv databases .",
    "initially , we identify suitable vvv fits catalogues to download and analyse from the casu , by selecting the near - ir multi - colour photometrically deeper dataset ( first epoch : @xmath0 )  and the separate multi - epoch @xmath1-bands ( hereafter , kv epochs ) of interest for an individual tile .",
    "we choose kv epoch frames that have similar @xmath34  photometric detection limits as well as having similar r.m.s .",
    "residuals to the 2mass - based astrometric - fit uncertainties ( casu calculated parameter ) , to aid in the proper identification of the same objects over all the epochs in order to reduce the incidence of contamination and false - positive detections .",
    "a positional cross - match is then made on the celestial coordinates on the first epoch @xmath0  fits catalogue data using stilts - v2.3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/ ) with a 0.3  arcsec matching radius .",
    "we also add a requirement that all valid sources for inclusion must have detections in all three @xmath0  catalogues .",
    "these multi - colour datasets are contemporaneous in epoch for a given tile , and allow us to obtain near - ir colours for any pm candidates we identify .",
    "the cross - matched detections are filtered during the conversion by the use of the casu morphological classification flag : sources are only selected having flag attribute values of -9 , -2 and -1 ( saturated , borderline stellar , and stellar , respectively ) .",
    "we read temporal keyword metadata from the catalogue fits headers and calculate the search radius limit in arcseconds to be applied in the cross - match between detections in the catalogues with differing epochs .",
    "the cross - match is based on a 5  arcsec  yr@xmath3  maximum pm limit that we apply , as well as a constraint ( @xmath35  mag ) placed on the difference between the two @xmath1-band magnitudes of cross - matched detections .",
    "this photometric constraint is based on the relaxed ( 0.2  mag ) absolute @xmath36  photometric uncertainty given by casu of 0.15 magnitudes in the @xmath37 for the vvv survey ( saito et al .",
    "2012 ) , and calculated as the @xmath38 for two separate detections being compared .",
    "this is applied to help match the correct source in fields of higher source density .    after the cross - match has been made to identify possible motions of up to 5  arcsec  yr@xmath3 , a constraint",
    "is then placed on a minimum allowable separation for valid candidate inclusion , which is based on the r.m.s .",
    "astrometric uncertainties of the equatorial coordinates in the particular catalogues ( casu derived values ) .",
    "this constraint requires that , for motion to be declared valid between the two catalogues , the measured separation must have a value @xmath39 , where the rms values are in arcseconds .",
    "the combined minimum separation constraint used here implies that a lower limit to the pm sensitivity exists that is also dependent on the temporal separation between epochs used , and therefore , will vary slightly between tiles .    during later testing of our method",
    "it was found that rather than using a @xmath36  astrometric uncertainty constraint for both the initial and refined stages of the analysis , relaxing this requirement for the initial candidate selection to a minimum of @xmath40  ( the r.m.s .",
    "value ; typically about 0.07 arcsec ) allowed us to reliably detect pms down to our lower sensitivity limits .",
    "therefore , we adopted those values throughout our search .",
    "any cross - matched sources found to have photometric detections at individual epochs that are fainter than the brightest @xmath34  photometric limit of all the measured kv epochs per tile , are removed as pm candidates .",
    "this is to reduce the instances of object miss - matches and avoid possible positional inaccuracies associated with fainter detections .    for each pm candidate identified from the initial selection",
    ", a test is then conducted to establish if both the pm and position angle measurements ( separation vectors ) between all the successive cross - matched epoch pairs are consistent with each other .",
    "the test is based on the assumption that any detectable motion should be linear , and is conducted in reverse temporal order of epoch with each separation vector measurement for each candidate required to be consistent to pass the test .    to check that successive pairs of separation vectors are consistent , the separation vector from the two",
    "latest measured kv epoch pairs ( say , epochs 3 and 2 ) is used to predict the position of a given pm candidate at epoch 1 ( assuming three epochs are available ) .",
    "if the measured position and predicted position are within a calculated maximum test radius ( depending on the positional errors and epoch difference ) then the pm candidate is retained .",
    "if three separate epochs are used ( minimum required ) then the test can only be conducted once , however , for each successive epoch added another test is also made , thereby increasing the effectiveness of the test in rejecting contamination .",
    "as mentioned above we relaxed the astrometric constraint in the initial selection , while using a @xmath36  test radius when comparing the separation of the predicted positions with that of the measured positions , to test for consistent separation vectors .",
    "due to the use of these differing astrometric constraints , there exists the possibility that for candidates passing with the smallest accepted separations ( smallest pms ) , their position angles and motion could be unrepresentative of a true underlying pm ( i.e. , spurious detections ) . to alleviate this possibility",
    ", we included an additional test in the refined analysis to check for realistic and consistent measurements in position angle over the separate epochs .",
    "this position angle test uses a geometrical argument that for two successive pairs of separation vectors ( with the minimum possible separation ) the corresponding positions measured at three separate epochs is likely to take the form of a triangle , but is unlikely to result in a triangle with an internal angle to the apex of @xmath41 , i.e. with an angle smaller than that of an equilateral triangle .",
    "the assumption here being that the apparent change in positions is due to true underlying linear pm .",
    "if the two sides of a triangle formed by a pair of separation vectors must form an angle > 60 degrees , then the allowable difference in position angle would have to be @xmath42 .",
    "this angle is the constraint we impose on successive position angle measurements for inclusion as a valid pm candidate .",
    "it was often noticed during the testing of our method that close blended sources in crowded areas , often associated with variability or regions of poorer astrometric fit , which were coincident over a small number of available epochs , would pass as pm candidates . to facilitate the removal of these false - positives",
    ", we introduced a final test on the candidates during the refinement stage of the analysis .",
    "this took the form of a cross - match of the candidate positions from the latest epoch , with the first epoch catalogue ( the original multi - colour dataset ) .",
    "if the candidate is matched within a test radius in the first epoch , and it has a similar apparent magnitude within @xmath35  ( as used in the initial selection above ) , then it is rejected . the test radius used to determine valid pm in this case",
    "is defined by : the difference between positions must be greater than the pm lower sensitivity limit ( in arcseconds ) multiplied by the temporal difference between the epochs .    for the remaining candidates that pass all test criteria we use the mean values of their pm and position angle measurements obtained over all their measured epochs , and these were used as the initial values for the search .",
    "the final values of the vvv pms in the catalogue , however , were obtained using the equatorial coordinates in the first and the last available vvv epoch .    finally , to reduce the number of pm candidates from all the vvv tiles to a manageable number for visual checking and cross - matching with other survey data such as 2mass",
    ", we introduced a photometric cut ( @xmath43  mag ) to select only the brightest candidates .",
    "we summarise the main points of our vvv pm candidate selection method as follows :    1 .",
    "select , download , and decompress all fits catalogues from casu per tile .",
    "cross - match the first epoch multi - colour @xmath0 fits catalogue dataset .",
    "3 .   select sources with `` casu classification flag '' : values of -9 , -2 and -1 only .",
    "convert fits results file to ascii for analysis .",
    "5 .   repeat a cross - match and initial analysis on a per - epoch basis per tile , to identify pm candidates .",
    "make a refined analysis over all epochs : perform a test for consistent motion and position angle .",
    "apply a test to facilitate the removal of false - positive detections .",
    "make a selection of the brightest pm candidates of @xmath43  magnitude for visual checking and follow - up .",
    "as it was already mentioned above , it is very difficult to operate a pm search in such crowded fields of stars , with too many contaminants provoking the detection of numerous false hpm objects .",
    "the main source of errors are the bright heavily saturated stars which produce numerous peaks and spikes in a surrounding area . in some cases they are too numerous and",
    "easily some of them could fulfil the above - mentioned search and refine criteria .",
    "the other significant source of errors comes from some very close stellar doublets with similar magnitudes .",
    "all these factors made a final visual check mandatory .",
    "we visually examined around 20000 probable hpm objects .",
    "the first step was to blink on the ds9 the first and last available vvv epoch ( @xmath44  armin ) images around each candidate available in the vista science archive ( vsa ) and to check for apparent motion .",
    "the time span between these epochs in most cases was about four years .",
    "then we overplotted the position of the 2mass stars in the area and checked again for the apparent motion .",
    "the limiting magnitude of @xmath45mag for our sample is relatively bright and the majority of the stars have a 2mass counterpart .",
    "we have provided a visual check for all candidates and the final list contains only visually confirmed pm objects .",
    "we find 3003 stars with pm @xmath2430 masyr@xmath3 in the entire vvv area ( bulge and disk ) .",
