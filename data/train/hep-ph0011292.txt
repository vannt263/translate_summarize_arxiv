    "it has been well known for years @xcite that bose - einstein ( be ) correlations measured in hadron - hadron reactions at sufficiently high energies exhibit a pronounced dependence on multiplicity in the form of the strength parameter @xmath0 . in @xmath1 reactions , this behaviour is either absent @xcite or at least much weaker , especially with a 2-jet selection @xcite .",
    "heavy ion reactions , on the other hand , see @xmath0 values decreasing with multiplicity at lower multiplicity densities ( lower @xmath2 reactions ) but increasing again measurements of different experiments are not easily compared because of varying systematics such as the chosen fit function and fit range , the `` cleanness '' of the pion sample , different treatments of coulomb corrections etc .",
    "the described tendencies in @xmath0 are therefore more qualitative than quantitative in nature .",
    "] at higher multiplicity densities @xcite .",
    "these findings may suggest a possible common explanation in terms of superposition of several sources or strings , where each of them symmetrizes separately according to the model of andersson and hofmann@xcite .",
    "no be correlations are then expected between decay products of different strings @xcite .",
    "the following arguments could be used : in the framework of the dual parton model for hadron hadron and heavy ion reactions @xcite , it is expected that higher multiplicities correspond to a higher number of strings or chains .",
    "this can explain the multiplicity dependence in hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "in @xmath1 reactions , with a selection of two - jet events , only one single string is formed and consequently one does not expect much dependence of be correlations on multiplicity . in heavy ion reactions , there is again an increasing number of strings with increasing multiplicity density , but eventually the densely - packed strings coalesce until they finally form a large single fireball .",
    "this picture can qualitatively explain why the be signal is decreasing at low @xmath2 and finally increasing again @xcite . a clean situation of a superposition of two strings occurs if two @xmath3-bosons are coproduced in @xmath1 reactions and both decay hadronically .",
    "if there are no be correlations between the pions from different strings , the @xmath0 values are expected to be diminished .",
    "unfortunately , these measurements are hampered by low statistics and experimental difficulties @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that this is not the only possible explanation of experimental behaviour . in the case of hadron - hadron reactions , for example , several alternative explanations do exist @xcite , among them the core - halo picture @xcite which connects consistently the multiplicity dependence of correlation functions of like - charge with those of opposite - charge pion pairs .    from all these considerations , it should be clear that there is important information in the observed multiplicity dependencies , in particular when comparing different reaction types .",
    "this contribution concentrates on a discussion of possible origins which could lead in the case of high energy hadron - hadron reactions to the observed multiplicity dependence .",
    "we first adress in section 2 the question of the influence of jet production by using again @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5  gev measured in the ua1 detector @xcite . low-@xmath6 and high-@xmath6 subsamples are investigated . using the low-@xmath6 subsample where the influence of jets is removed to a large extent , we finally discuss in section 3 possible underlying physics .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in hadron - hadron reactions the probability of jet production rises with energy and multiplicity .",
    "the multiplicity dependence of correlation functions can be influenced by this hard subprocess . to investigate this influence , we used a data sample similar to that in @xcite but with larger statistics",
    ": it consists of 2,460,000 non - single - diffractive @xmath4 reactions at @xmath5  gev measured by the ua1 central detector  @xcite . only vertex - associated charged tracks with transverse momentum @xmath7  gev / c and @xmath8 have been used .",
    "we restrict the azimuthal angle to @xmath9 ( `` good azimuth '' ) .",
    "these cuts define a region in momentum space which we call @xmath10 .",
    "since the multiplicity for the entire azimuthal range is the physically relevant quantity , we select events according to their uncorrected all - azimuth charged - particle multiplicity @xmath11 .",
    "the corrected multiplicity density is then estimated as twice @xmath12 , the charged - particle multiplicity in good azimuth : @xmath13 .",
    "the measured quantities are @xmath14 , the second order normalized cumulant correlation functions in several multiplicity intervals @xmath15 $ ] ; for a complete definition , refer to @xcite .",
    "they are measured for pairs of like - sign ( @xmath16 ) and opposite - sign ( @xmath17 ) charge separately as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean numbers of positive or negative particles , @xmath17 pairs and @xmath16 pairs respectively in the whole interval @xmath10 and in the multiplicity range @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the prefactors in front of the normalized density correlation functions @xmath23 correct for the bias introduced by fixing multiplicity @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined for @xmath16 and @xmath17 pairs in the correlation integral description @xcite @xmath26 with @xmath27 the spacelike four - momentum difference of the pion pairs .",
    "internal cumulants ( [ se ] ) and ( [ se1 ] ) are analysed in three samples as a function of pion transverse momentum @xmath6 as follows :    * an all-@xmath6 sample of all like - sign and opposite - sign pion pairs in @xmath10 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 for three representative multiplicity densities . * a low-@xmath6 subsample containing only charged particles with @xmath28  gev / c .",
    "also removed from the subsample were entire events containing either a jet with @xmath29  gev or at least one charged particle with @xmath30  gev / c .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously @xcite that all high-@xmath6 particles stem from jets or minijets .    from figs .",
    "13 , we see that whereas the low-@xmath6 subsample behaves very similarly to the all-@xmath6 sample , there is a pronounced increase in the strength of correlation functions for the high-@xmath6 case ( iii ) ( note the different scale on the plot ! ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as the influence of jets , which are inherently spiky in nature . in this case , be correlations are hence mixed up with correlations originating from jets , so that it would be difficult to measure them separately .",
    "we note further that @xmath16 functions in fig .",

    "( [ ex1 ] ) gives `` radius parameters '' @xmath35 which decrease with increasing multiplicity , in contrast to the samples ( i ) @xcite and ( ii ) .",
    "3 shows also a pronounced secondary peak after a minimum at @xmath36  gev which can be attributed to the onset of local @xmath6 compensation with two back - to - back particles with at least @xmath37  gev / c corresponding to the cut applied in this subsample @xcite .",
    "the fits performed to @xmath16 pair data in fig.1 ",
    "fig.3 are exponential , @xmath38 the corresponding dependence of @xmath0 on multiplicity is used in subsequent figures .",
    "4 compares the multiplicity dependence of the all-@xmath6 and low-@xmath6 samples in the small-@xmath34 region ( @xmath39  gev ) .",
    "the two samples differ only slightly in their respective cumulants as well as their @xmath0 values .",
    "5 shows the corresponding multiplicity dependence in the high-@xmath6 sample , once again on a larger scale in @xmath14 .",
    "the influence of jets shows up dramatically : all correlation functions are increased in height , and the @xmath17 functions do not show a multiplicity dependence for particle densities @xmath40",
    ". a decrease like in ( i ) and ( ii ) is probably compensated by increasing jet activity .",
    "the interplay of be correlations and resonance production with the onset of jet production and the transition from soft to hard interactions are interesting questions in their own right and can be studied with samples like the high-@xmath6 one .",
    "we will , however , concentrate in the following on the low-@xmath6 subsample .",
    "the results of a study with the all-@xmath6 sample ( i ) have been published in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 , we plot for the low-@xmath6 sample ( ii ) the same ratio @xmath41 for like - sign and opposite - sign pairs respectively , while fig .",
    "7 shows the behaviour of the low-@xmath6 cumulants for fixed @xmath34 but varying multiplicity .",
    "these figures show that the all-@xmath6 results found previously remain valid for the low-@xmath6 sample also , namely :    * the like - sign and opposite - sign cumulants have very similar multiplicity dependence when compared in the same @xmath34 region .",
    "* cumulants behave distinctly differently at small and large @xmath34 : at small @xmath34 , the multiplicity dependence of both samples is weaker than @xmath42 , while at large @xmath43  gev ) the cumulants are negative and follow roughly a @xmath42 law instead of @xmath44 here and below ( @xmath45 ) . ] . *",
    "a third region around @xmath46  gev shows small and rapidly changing cumulants .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss four possible explanations of these phenomena .",
    "it should be stressed that the lund monte carlo model ( pythia ) can not reproduce the multiplicity dependence of correlation functions and in particular of the be effect @xcite .    *",
    "* bose einstein correlations are the result of symmetrization within individual strings only * @xcite : when several strings are produced , each string symmetrizes separately and decay products of different strings would hence not contribute to be correlations @xcite .",
    "+ because unnormalized cumulants of independent distributions combine additively , the independent superposition in momentum space of @xmath47 equal sources / strings , each with a @xmath48th order cumulant @xmath49 and each with some multiplicity distribution ( e.g.  poisson ) results in an unnormalized combined cumulant @xmath50 of @xmath51 while the combined single particle spectrum is given in terms of individual sources spectra by @xmath52 so that the @xmath48th order normalized cumulants for @xmath47 superimposed sources is given by @xmath53 hence @xmath54 is inversely proportional to the number of sources .",
    "this remains true for the correlation integral @xmath55 also .",
    "+ the above derivation is only for illustration .",
    "if @xmath56 , this would imply @xmath57 only if @xmath58 , i.e.  for identical sources each of fixed multiplicity .",
    "in reality , the assumption of equal sources is probably not fulfilled .",
    "the following scenario might be more realistic : `` fixing multiplicity does not necessarily mean fixing the number of sources .",
    "the sources ( we will them define below ) probably do possess a whole multiplicity distribution rather than a single fixed multiplicity .",
    "our selected multiplicities range from 0.83 to 9.1 , varying over about a factor 10 . at small @xmath34 , however , the @xmath59 vary only by at most a factor 3 .",
    "this suggests that at the highest selected multiplicity we would observe the superposition of only 3 sources , from which we are sampling their high multiplicity tails . '' in the dual parton model approach @xcite , one source might be identified with the topology of one pomeron exchange .",
    "if we select low - multiplicity events , we expect to select the case of one pomeron exchange .",
    "multiparton collisions corresponding to multipomeron exchange are expected to contribute to higher - multiplicity events .",
    "estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite predict two- to three - pomeron exchanges at the highest multiplicities seen by ua1 .",
    "the number of sources would increase correspondingly .",
    "this could explain the suppression of @xmath16 ( bose - einstein ) functions in fig .",
    "however , additional assumptions are needed to explain the similar behaviour of @xmath16 and @xmath17 functions in figs .",
    "6a and 7a and their @xmath60 dependence at large q ( figs 6b , 7b ) .",
    "resonance production and colour reconnection effects might be candidates ( see sect .",
    "* * quantum statistical approach * : a chaoticity parameter @xmath61 decreasing with multiplicity would , in the quantum statistical approach @xcite , decrease be correlations at higher multiplicities . in this picture",
    ", however , the question arises what the physical nature of the subprocess causing increased coherence at higher multiplicities would be .",
    "also , the similarity of the behaviour of @xmath16 and @xmath17 correlation functions in fig .  7 is not easily explained within this framework . * * be and resonance - induced correlations combined * : one could hypothesise that the observed multiplicity dependence of @xmath16 correlation functions is the result of two processes @xcite : + \\a ) bose - einstein correlations in the classical sense which , being a global effect , are independent of multiplicity @xcite , ) and   ( [ se1 ] ) . ] and b ) the production of higher mass - resonances or clusters decaying into two or more like - sign pions : @xmath62 ( as seen for example in @xmath63 decay ) . if the unnormalized cumulants @xmath64 and @xmath65 were wholly the result of resonance decays and if the number of resonances were proportional to the multiplicity @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",

    "7a ( straight line ) .",
    "the @xmath42 dependence in fig .",
    "7b at large @xmath34 suggests the existence of a resonance / cluster component for both @xmath16 and @xmath17 pair production . the resonance contribution to the correlation functions",
    "would be concentrated mainly at the region around @xmath72  gev as in the case of @xmath73 production , which is visible as a peak in the @xmath17 functions in figs .",
    "this region is however difficult to investigate because there the @xmath74 are decreasing rapidly with increasing @xmath34 while the @xmath75 are already small .",
    "a @xmath42-dependence due to resonances or clusters in this dominant phase space region around 1 gev could presumably cause the large-@xmath34 region to follow suit via missing pairs , thus explaining the observed dependence there .",

    "7a can hardly be explained by assuming only the two components a ) and b ) .",

    "( [ resin ] ) and would explain its constant @xmath77 part by noting that the number of @xmath78 pairs that can be formed from @xmath79 positive pions and @xmath80 negative pions would be @xmath81 .",
    "if each of these pairs was correlated ( statistically speaking ) , i.e.  if all @xmath82 pions were mutually correlated , the unnormalised @xmath83 would be proportional to @xmath84 and hence after normalisation @xmath76 constant in @xmath66 .",
    "such a constant term signalizes maximum possible correlations in some events . + more generally and following the arguments leading to eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , we could also say : `` if resonance production were to rise more quickly than @xmath85 , then @xmath86 would decrease more slowly than @xmath42 '' . * * the core - halo picture * @xcite .",
    "this picture is currently the only one which connects the multiplicity dependence of @xmath16 with that of @xmath17 correlation functions .",
    "the core - halo picture is based on the fact that bose - einstein correlations of decay products from long - lived resonances are not observable by experiments because they occur below experimental resolution and hence by definition belong to the `` halo '' of resonances that decay at large distances .",
    "examples are @xmath87  fm / c , @xmath88  fm / c , @xmath89  fm / c , which are all unresolvable within the ua1 experiment which can resolve decay products for distances @xmath90  fm only , corresponding to @xmath91  mev . because of the halo , the @xmath0 values of be fits",
    "are in general reduced @xcite , @xmath92 where the second factor describes the momentum dependence and @xmath93 is the smallest @xmath34 value accessible by the experiment  mev and that the fit parameters ( of gaussian fits ) are insensitive to the exact value of @xmath93 in a certain restricted region . ] . the relation between @xmath0 and the fraction of pions emitted by the halo follows from eq .  ( [ rla ] ) and from @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mean multiplicity of directly produced `` core '' pions",
    ", @xmath96 is the mean multiplicity of halo pions and @xmath97 = @xmath98 + @xmath96 .",
    "this means that @xmath99 from eq .",
    "( [ rla2 ] ) it is evident that @xmath0 remains independent of multiplicity only if @xmath100 and consequently @xmath101 .",
    "if however the number of halo - resonances increases faster than @xmath102 , then also the number of their decay particles @xmath103 . as a consequence",
    "the be parameter @xmath0 will decrease with multiplicity .",
    "+ a second consequence emerges immediately ( see last sentence in sect . 3.3 ) : the fraction of @xmath86 stemming directly from the decay of halo resonances will decrease less rapidly than @xmath104 .",
    "a previous study @xcite revealed the @xmath34 region where two - body @xmath105 decay products of the halo resonances @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 contribute , namely in @xmath109  gev .",
    "this is exactly the region where @xmath17 correlation functions indeed show a multiplicity dependence weaker than @xmath110 as shown in fig .",
    "6b ( where the @xmath60 case is indicated by the dashed line ) .",
    "+ so far , this discussion is purely qualitative .",
    "how the decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath66 would compare to an effective slower - than-@xmath42 decrease of @xmath76 is , of course , a quantitative question not answered by the above argument , both because @xmath0 refers to the minimum @xmath34  -value and its stability against shifts is not yet tested , and because the experimental fraction @xmath111 is known only sparsely , if at all .",
    "a more quantitative estimate has to be done in future , including the fact that the previously measured @xmath59 for the whole sample @xcite are already near unity at @xmath112  gev , even after subtracting the background contribution due to the non - poissonian overall multiplicity distribution . correcting for an additional halo contribution could finally cause @xmath59 for @xmath113 to be greater than 1 .",
    "the four different explanations considered above each have some merit .",
    "it is clearly desirable to shorten this list of candidates .",
    "we believe that higher order cumulants are suitable for this purpose : if symmetrization of individual strings is the right explanation , we can expect from eq .",
    "( [ ss1 ] ) and ref .",
    "@xcite that the higher - order cumulants would decrease much faster with multiplicity than @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xmath114 ) .",
    "since such a fast decrease is not predicted e.g.  for the core - halo picture @xcite , the measurement of the multiplicity dependence of @xmath115 could probably decide between the two cases ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.4 ) .",
