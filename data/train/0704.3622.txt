    "in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems , an ordered phase can undergo an amorphization transition in the presence of random quenched disorder . at zero temperature and for sufficiently strong quenched disorder ,",
    "this transition is characterized by the appearance of isolated dislocations @xcite .",
    "disordering transitions can have a profound effect on transport properties .",
    "one of the best known examples of this phenomenon is the peak effect observed for vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite . here",
    ", an ordered vortex lattice is weakly pinned by random quenched disorder ; however , as the temperature or magnetic field is increased , the vortex lattice disorders and a sudden increase or peak in the pinning force occurs .",
    "the peak effect is known to be relevant to 2d and effectively 2d superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "an early explanation for the increase in the pinning force was that a disordered vortex system with numerous topological defects is much softer than an ordered vortex lattice , and as a result the vortices in the disordered state can shift positions in order to accommodate to the pinning landscape @xcite .",
    "a proliferation of topological defects has also been correlated with an increase in the effective friction force in nanomaterials near the bulk melting temperature where a peak effect type phenomenon can occur @xcite .",
    "although the peak effect has been associated with the appearance of topological defects , a comprehensive understanding of exactly how the density or type of topological defects relates to the pinning effectiveness is still lacking . interpreting the peak effect phenomenon",
    "is also complicated by thermal effects , and controversy remains over whether the disordering of the vortex lattice is predominately a melting phenomena @xcite or is nonthermal @xcite .",
    "there are still several open issues related to the peak effect in superconductors and its connection to the shape of the current - voltage curves @xcite , transient dynamics @xcite , and the magnetic field - temperature ( h - t ) phase diagram @xcite .    in two dimensional systems with binary or polydisperse interactions",
    ", a topological disordering transition occurs with increasing dispersity @xcite .",
    "an open question is how quenched disorder affects a dispersity - driven amorphization process and how the amorphization might alter the pinning effectiveness .",
    "a stiff lattice is poorly pinned by random disorder , and thus in a monodisperse assembly of repulsively interacting particles on quenched random disorder , the depinning threshold decreases when the lattice is stiffened by increasing the repulsion between the particles @xcite .",
    "a similar decrease of the depinning threshold with increasing particle - particle interactions occurs even when the monodisperse system contains some topological disorder and is no longer a perfect elastic lattice @xcite .",
    "the situation may be different in a bidisperse system where the relative strength of the repulsive interactions between the two particle species can be independently tuned .",
    "if the interaction strength of one species is increased while that of the other species is held constant , the depinning threshold for motion over a random substrate may decrease ; however , an amorphization of the bidisperse lattice occurs when the difference between the repulsive interactions of the two species is large enough .",
    "the effective softness of the lattice increases sharply once topological defects appear in the system , and thus the depinning threshold may increase rather than decrease when the particle interaction strength is increased across the amorphization transition .",
    "polydisperse systems with quenched disorder can be used as models for exploring the interaction between defects and pinning since the number of topological defects can be controlled readily .",
    "binary and polydisperse particle interactions appear in a variety of systems which can also have quenched disorder , including vortices in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , electron bubble mixtures @xcite , mixtures of abrikosov and josephson vortices @xcite , and colloidal systems @xcite . in two dimensional colloidal systems ,",
    "it was recently demonstrated that interactions with a very long screening length can be realized experimentally @xcite and that disordered phases occur which are likely induced by polydispersity @xcite .",
    "two dimensional colloidal disordering transitions and pinning phenomena in the presence of quenched disorder have also been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "interaction dispersity can also arise in the pinning of a nanofriction system",
    ". it would be very useful to understand how to control the defect density and pinning in these types of systems by manipulating the polydispersity in the particle interactions .",
    "in this paper we consider a two dimensional model of two species of particles interacting via a repulsive yukawa potential both with and without quenched disorder . in the absence of quenched disorder",
    ", we find a well defined low temperature disordering transition as a function of dispersity . in the presence of weak quenched disorder ,",
    "this disordering transition is accompanied by a sharp increase in the depinning force or a peak effect .",
    "the peak effect phenomenon we observe is nonthermal and occurs due to the proliferation of topological defects .",
    "our results indicate that there is a complex interplay between the density of topological defects and the depinning force .",
    "we identify where the peak effect phenomenon occurs as a function of pinning strength , density , radius , and interparticle interaction strength .",

    "these results show that the peak effect phenomenon is observable in a polydisperse system whenever the effective quenched disorder is weak enough that the monodisperse system is free of defects .",
    "the monodisperse lattice is pinned collectively by the random disorder , and the collective pinning is always weaker than the single particle pinning which occurs in a topologically disordered polydisperse particle lattice . in regimes where the quenched disorder is strong enough that both the monodisperse and the polydisperse systems are topologically disordered , there is little difference in the depinning force between the polydisperse and the monodisperse cases , and no peak in the depinning force appears .",

    "recent simulations of two - dimensional monodisperse yukawa particle systems have shown that as a function of defect density , the orientational correlations are lost when the fraction of defected particles is @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the orientational correlations are measured by means of the local bond orientational order parameter @xcite , @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the number of nearest neighbors of particle @xmath59 and @xmath151 is the angle between an arbitrary fixed reference axis and the bond connecting particles @xmath59 and @xmath152 .",

    "the system is orientationally ordered and the depinning is elastic in nature .",
    "the defects soften the lattice locally , allowing the particles to become better pinned .",
    "as more defects are added and @xmath62 increases , the lattice continues to soften until the orientational order is lost at @xmath83 , which corresponds to the elastic - plastic depinning transition .",

    "@xmath16 is more highly charged than species @xmath15 and thus species @xmath16 is in general less well pinned due to the higher strength of the particle - particle interaction compared to the particle - pin interaction . as @xmath105 increases from zero , the defect density of the entire system increases , which would normally lead to more effective pinning , but clumps of species @xmath16 particles can form and create localized poorly pinned areas , which may decrease the overall pinning effectiveness .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to address , an open question is to understand exactly why a fraction of @xmath83 defects corresponds to the loss of orientational order in two - dimensional systems and whether this fraction @xmath83 of defects is universal to all two - dimensional systems at the orientational disordering transition regardless of the form of the particle - particle interactions .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that for a binary assembly of repulsively interacting yukawa particles , there can be an order to disorder dispersity driven transition induced by the addition of a more strongly repulsive species . in the presence of weak quenched disorder , the dispersity driven transition coincides with a peak effect in the depinning force .",
    "the depinning force for a mixture of particles can be higher than that for either of the pure species . if the quenched disorder is strong and the pure species sample is already disordered , the addition of a more strongly repulsive species monotonically decreases the depinning force . for a completely ordered system ,",
    "if the addition of a new species does not induce dislocations , there is no enhancement of the depinning force .",
    "we also find that the optimal pinning occurs when the fraction of non - sixfold coordinated particles is around @xmath161 , which correlates with the loss of orientational order .",
    "our results suggest that a peak effect phenomenon can occur without thermal fluctuations and that the effectiveness of the pinning can be tuned by adjusting the particle mixture .",
