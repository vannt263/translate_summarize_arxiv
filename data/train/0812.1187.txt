    "extrapolation of the @xmath48 parameters for reo@xmath0 down to 0k reveals non - zero values , which indicates significant contribution from static displacement , especially in the case of @xmath22 ( see fig.[thermal_temp]a ) .",
    "the large gap between @xmath22 and @xmath45 at low temperatures was observed for all three samples . a useful parameter to describe the extent of anisotropy in the atomic displacements is the ratio of the maximum value to the minimum value of @xmath48;@xcite in our case , it is @xmath22/@xmath45 .",

    "most importantly , the higher @xmath22/@xmath45 ratios for reo@xmath0-a and reo@xmath0-b than for reo@xmath0-c at low temperatures suggest more static disorder in the first two , which should affect the lattice dynamical properties .",
    "the @xmath49 mode calculated by chatterji _",
    "et al _ involves rotation of the reo@xmath5 octahedra in the @xmath50 plane and arises from transverse motion of the o atoms in this plane.@xcite since the @xmath49 mode has the largest contribution to the negative value for @xmath25 at low temperatures , static displacement of the o atoms , transversely from the re  o  re bond , would diminish the nte behavior .",

    "( b ) data plotted as @xmath57 _ vs. _ @xmath58 in order to reveal any low energy phonon spectral weight .",
    "the absence of any peaks indicates a lack of contribution from any einstein - type modes ; the debye contribution appears as a constant up to @xmath56 and the rise at low @xmath59 is due to the electronic contribution ( @xmath60 ) of the delocalized electrons.,title=\"fig : \" ]    specific heat measurements on a single crystal of reo@xmath0 were carried out to understand the type of lattice vibrations contributing to the specific heat .",
    "the low temperature behavior in the heat capacity of reo@xmath0 is that of a straightforward debye solid , with a debye temperature @xmath56 of 344k and a sommerfeld coefficient @xmath54 of 2.8mjmol@xmath2k@xmath55 ( see fig.[heat_cap]a ) .",
    "these values agree very well with the values of 327k for @xmath56 and 2.85mjmol@xmath2k@xmath55 for @xmath54 found in the early studies by king _ _ et al.__@xcite fig.[heat_cap]b shows the specific heat over @xmath61 vs. @xmath59 , which is an approximate representation of the one - dimensional phonon density of states of a solid.@xcite a signature of an einstein mode in this representation is a gaussian - like peak  clearly missing in the low temperature region of the specific heat .",
    "these measurements strengthen the argument by chatterji _ et al . _ from their lattice dynamical calculations that nte in reo@xmath0 is caused by low energy acoustic modes with the @xmath49 mode contributing the most to the nte behavior.@xcite also , the specific heat results rule out the suggestion by matsuno _",
    "_ that a low energy , bending - like optical mode is responsible for nte in reo@xmath0.@xcite    although both zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 and reo@xmath0 have cubic symmetry , it is interesting to compare how their structures lead do different nte behavior . the primitive cubic structure of reo@xmath0 ( given the absence of the @xmath7 cation in its structure and thus an extremal value of the perovskite tolerance factor ) is of course the consequence of metallicity : the large volume is maintained by the fermi pressure of the delocalized d - electrons in the @xmath62 conduction band .",
    "nevertheless , the proximity to a ` buckling transition ' is revealed by a pressure - induced collapse of the structure produced by cooperative counter - rotation of the octahedra,@xcite in this case very similar to zrw@xmath3o@xmath4.@xcite the linear @xmath25 obtained for reo@xmath0 is smaller than that observed in zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 , where @xmath63 k@xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the smaller absolute value of the nte and the smaller temperature range at which it occurs in reo@xmath0 compared to zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 is consistent with the much weaker precursor effects in the pressure - induced collapse in the former than in the latter.@xcite in turn , the weakness of the fluctuations in reo@xmath0 is possibly a consequence of it possessing fewer soft degrees of freedom than the more open framework structure of zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 . in addition , the low energy einstein - type modes observed in zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 and implicated in that material s nte behavior,@xcite are clearly missing in reo@xmath0 .    the relatively small nte effect observed in reo@xmath0 remains , nevertheless , remarkable because it is isotropic and unprecedented for a material with the electronic properties of a simple metal .",
    "while classifying an oxide as a simple metal is atypical , the free - electron model works well enough in reo@xmath0 that it qualifies under the scheme of electrical transport properties ( other examples include the na@xmath64wo@xmath0 bronzes and ruo@xmath3).@xcite most simple metals have a much larger @xmath25 than that of reo@xmath0 .",
    "for example , for copper , @xmath25 is @xmath65k@xmath2 at room temperature.@xcite another notable exception is the intermetallic ygage , which has such small @xmath25 that its behavior has been termed zero thermal expansion.@xcite like ygage , reo@xmath0 is also remarkable in that its @xmath25 above room temperature is as low as in a highly covalent material like diamond where @xmath25 is @xmath66k@xmath2.@xcite while reo@xmath0 does exhibit highly metallic behavior , the strong covalency between the re d - states and o p - states and its unique framework topology allow for negative thermal expansion , demonstrating the propensity for transition metal oxides to challenge our conventions on bonding and properties in solid materials .",
    "furthermore , reo@xmath0 s relatively simple structure has provided a way to quantify the role of static disorder of the oxygen atoms on interesting behavior such as negative thermal expansion .",
