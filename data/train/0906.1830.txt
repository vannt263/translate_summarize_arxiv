    "atoms , or their artificial counterparts , quantum dots , in cavities or traps have great potential for applications in quantum communication , metrology and information processing .",
    "since entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum computation and communication , the preparation of maximally entangled states is a crucial task .",
    "nonlocal interactions between two physical qubits are required to generate entanglement and there have been numerous proposals to effect such interactions , especially for atoms trapped in distant cavities  @xcite , and similar schemes are conceivable for artificial atoms such as quantum dots . some of these proposals make use of continuous feedback in open quantum systems  @xcite but most are based on hamiltonian systems , and in most cases only simple geometric control schemes are employed to create the maximally entangled state .",
    "these methods have the advantage of simplicity but unfortunately often suffer from robustness issues .    in this work",
    "we explore an alternative control design inspired by lyapunov functions  @xcite to find control designs for robust entanglement creation .",
    "lyapunov control design has the advantage of being sufficient simple to be amenable to rigorous analysis , and much is known about their convergence properties , robustness and stability . in particular",
    "such design can be shown to be highly effective for systems that satisfy certain sufficient conditions , which are roughly equivalent to the controllability of the linearized system  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this appears to be a strong requirement not satisfied by many physical systems .",
    "however , in certain cases , in particular for systems like the two - atom model proposed by mancini and bose  @xcite , we can circumvent these restrictions by considering the dynamics on a subspace and successfully apply lyapunov control to create maximally entangled states from certain initial product states in robust fashion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly review the distant - atom model and the geometric control scheme proposed in @xcite to generate entanglement . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lyapunov ] we briefly review lyapunov control and show how to apply it to the problem of steering the system from certain product state to one of the four bell state in a robust fashion .",
    "we will consider two control paradigms : one is to control the local hamiltonian which is easier to implement experimentally ; the other is to control the non - local interaction hamiltonian , which might be possible for certain systems .",
    "and @xmath0 , each of which contains a two - level atom , are connected into a closed loop through optical fibers .",
    "the off - resonant driving field @xmath1 generates an effective non - local hamiltonian @xmath2 while the two local resonant lasers generate the local hamiltonian @xmath3 . ]",
    "we consider a two - qubit model where the qubits are encoded in two atoms or two quantum dots in distant cavities connected into a closed loop by optical fibers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that eliminating the interacting light field between the two atoms in the dispersive regime leads to an effective hamiltonian for the two - atom system of form @xmath4 , where the local hamiltonian induced by interaction with resonant light and the effective interaction hamiltonian are :    [ eqn : two - atom ] @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are pauli operators and @xmath9 is the identity operator , and the coupling constant @xmath10 where @xmath11 should be sufficiently smaller than @xmath12 to ensure the derivation of @xmath13 remains valid .",
    "this hamiltonian can be used to generate a maximally entangled state from the initial ground state by turning on @xmath14 for a critical time @xmath15 before switching the field off  @xcite . broadly speaking , by applying a constant hamiltonian we effectively perform a rotation about a fixed axis in the two - qubit space , and with the correct timing we can choose the rotation angle such as to ensure that the system state ends at the correct target state . however , plotting the concurrence of the final state versus the interaction time ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) shows that achieving very high fidelity with respect to the maximally entangled state requires very precise switching as the concurrence is subject to small fluctuations . in the model",
    "we have assumed a fixed coupling strength @xmath16 and controllable local field @xmath17 .",
    "we see that increasing @xmath17 significantly reduces the time required to prepare a maximally entangled state but also increased the magnitude of the fluctuations .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath18 the fluctuations around the peak are only about @xmath12% but it takes @xmath19 time units to reach a maximally entangled state . for @xmath20 on the other hand , we can prepare a maximally entangled state in about @xmath21 of the time but the concurrence fluctuations increase by a factor of approximately @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , although such design for entanglement generation is quite simple , it is not robust against imperfections of switching time .    .",
    "achieving unit concurrence requires requires switching off the hamiltonian precisely , due to the fluctuations concurrence curve .",
    "if the control hamiltonian is switched on or off too early or too late , even by a small amount , the concurrence of the final state may be reduced significantly .",
    "the three sub - figures on top of the main figure shows the zoom - in of the plots . ]",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the method of entanglement generation by switching a constant field on for a fixed amount of time is highly sensitive to small switching time errors .",
    "ideally , we would like a control scheme where the concurrence of the two qubits converges to @xmath12 asymptotically , and better without any fluctuations . in that way",
    ", the control is robust against switching time errors .",
    "a simple method that seems well suited to this task is lyapunov - based design . roughly speaking",
    ", the idea of lyapunov control is to choose a suitable so - called lyapunov function @xmath23 and then try to find a control that ensures that @xmath23 is monotonically decreasing along any dynamical evolution .    in the time scale where the hamiltonian evolution is still a good approximation ,",
    "many physical systems satisfy the the quantum liouville equation ( with @xmath24 ) @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed the hamiltonian has two parts : @xmath26 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath27 is the interaction hamiltonian , with the interaction coupling constant modulated by the function @xmath28 . for example , for a two - level structure of a single atom , @xmath29 is the energy splitting , and @xmath30 is the dipole interaction between the laser and the atom , with a varying @xmath28 by modulating the laser amplitude .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 can be varied is very crucial from control point of view , since this degree of freedom allows us to design the dynamics to derive the desired evolution .",
    "we can define a general control task thus : for a given target state @xmath31 , for example , a maximally entangled state , we wish to find a control function @xmath28 , such that the system state @xmath32 will converge to @xmath31 , as @xmath33 . in many applications , we allow @xmath34 to evolve under @xmath26 , and the control requirement becomes @xmath35 as @xmath33 , which is generally known as tracking control  @xcite . in the following",
    "we assume : @xmath36\\ ] ]    motivated from the theory of lyapunov function and the hilbert schmidt distance @xmath37 , we define @xmath38.\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath39 , if we choose @xmath40),\\ ] ] we find that for @xmath41 , @xmath42)=-\\kappa f(t)^2\\le 0.\\ ] ] hence @xmath23 is a lypunov function and the value of @xmath23 monotonically decreases along any solution @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , every solution @xmath43 converges to an invariant set @xmath44 , called the lasalle invariant set , on which @xmath45 vanishes .",
    "discussions on lyapunov - based design in terms of density operators have been analyzed  @xcite .",
    "in particular , many target states can be shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable if the hamiltonian satisfies certain demanding conditions : ( i ) @xmath26 be strongly regular and ( ii ) @xmath27 be fully connected  @xcite .",
    "the former condition translates into the requirement that @xmath26 have distinct transition frequencies between any pair of energy levels .",
    "this rules out systems with degenerate or equally spaced energy levels .",
    "the latter condition is even more demanding . in the basis where @xmath26 is diagonal , all the off - diagonal elements of @xmath27 must be non - zero , i.e. transitions between any two energy level of @xmath26 can be realized .",
    "when the strict conditions on the hamiltonian do not hold , for most cases , the target state can be shown to be no longer asymptotically stable , and we no longer have @xmath35 , implying that the control design becomes ineffective .",
    "this really restricts the applicability of the method especially for higher - dimensional systems , including two - qubit models and spin chains",
    ".    however , for high - dimensional systems with hamiltonian not satisfying the above conditions , it is still possible to make the target state asymptotically stable on a subspace , where the lyapunov control can be applied effectively . in the following , for the two - distant - atom model ( fig .  [ fig0 ] ) , we illustrate how the lyapunov control design can be utilized to drive the system state from a product state to a maximally entangled state , despite the fact that the full hamiltonian of the system clearly does not satisfy the strict conditions set out above .",
    "for the two - distant - atom model with hamiltonian ( [ eqn : two - atom ] ) , we can either choose the control hamiltonian @xmath27 to be the local hamiltonians @xmath46 or the effective coupling hamiltonian @xmath47 , depending on which scenario is easier to implement for a particular physical system .       and",
    "distance between the system state and the bell state @xmath48 .",
    "the control design is robust in that the field amplitude gently decreases to zero , and the semilog distance plot shows that the convergence to the target state is not only monotonic but also exponential with the converging rate determined by @xmath49 . ]    first , let us consider controlling the local hamiltonian . in this case we choose @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to make the hamiltonian easier to analyze , we transform from the @xmath8-eigenbasis @xmath52 to the @xmath6-eigenbasis @xmath53 .",
    "in this basis , the matrices for the hamiltonian are rewritten as    @xmath54    and it is easy to see that the eigenvectors of @xmath26 are the bell states    @xmath55    to generate maximally entangled state , we can choose @xmath56 , for instance , and the control @xmath57)$ ] , according to ( [ eqn : f ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath26 and @xmath27 do not satisfy the strict condition in section  [ sec : lyapunov ] .",
    "thus this design can not drive every state to the target state , but we can see that if the initial state of the system is @xmath58 or @xmath59 then the state will converge to the target state .",
    "in fact , in the bell - state basis , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61    for states initially prepared in the subspace @xmath62 spanned by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we clearly see that the dynamics under the hamiltonian @xmath65 will be confined in that subspace , and thus we can consider the dynamics on this two - dimensional subspace @xmath62 where the hamiltonians and state take the form : @xmath66 the results in  @xcite now guarantee that all solutions in @xmath62 except for @xmath67 will converge to the target state . the control field varies smoothly and steers the system gently to the target state as shown in fig .",
    "moreover convergence is exponential and @xmath68 h_1)| \\\\           & = \\kappa \\norm{i[\\rho(t),\\rho_d(t ) ] h_1 } \\\\           & \\le \\kappa \\norm{i[\\rho(t),\\rho_d(t ) ] } \\cdot \\norm{h_1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] shows that @xmath28 is bounded and we can choose @xmath49 to ensure that @xmath69 is sufficiently small and the approximations inherent in the model remain valid .    the method can also be utilized to increase the entanglement in the initial state , i.e , to prepare a maximally entangled state starting with a partially entangled one . more specifically ,",
    "if the system initial starts in the state @xmath70 then the control design produces a control field that steers the system from this state to the desired maximally entangled state @xmath71 .",
    "choosing @xmath72 instead , we can similarly prepare @xmath67 , and it can be verified that steering the state to @xmath73 simply requires inverting the sign of the control field .",
    "thus , not only can we prepare a maximally entangled state , but we can select which state we prepare .",
    "if the coupling constants of the local hamiltonian for the two atoms are not exactly identical , e.g. , if @xmath74 then changing to the @xmath6-basis gives @xmath75 , which transforms to @xmath76 thus for @xmath77 we can also steer the system from the product states @xmath78 or @xmath79 to the bell state @xmath80 , i.e. , for this two - atom model lyapunov control can be used to prepare any of the four bell states .",
    "one limitation of the scheme is that the initial state must be in the subspace @xmath62 , for example , @xmath81 , for the control to be effective .",
    "this is not a shortcoming of the proposed control scheme , however , because we can see from the structure of @xmath82 and @xmath83 that the control system is decomposable , hence not controllable on the whole space  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the dynamics on the orthogonal subspaces @xmath62 and @xmath84 are independent , and subspace populations are conserved quantities .",
    "thus , for the above hamiltonian , _ no _ control exists that steers population from subspace @xmath62 to @xmath84 and vice versa .       and distance between the system state and the target state with @xmath85 .",
    "the control design is robust in that the field amplitude gently decreases to zero , and the semilog distance plot shows that the convergence to the target state is not only monotonic but actually exponential , although unlike in the local control case , @xmath86 does not converge to @xmath87 .",
    "the final @xmath32 is still maximally entangled with unit concurrence . ]    instead of controlling the atoms locally , we can alternatively control the nonlocal hamiltonian @xmath88 , if the underlying physical system allows .",
    "in this case we choose @xmath89 and @xmath90 , or in the @xmath6-eigenbasis @xmath91 the bell states are no longer the eigenstates of @xmath26 .",
    "hence , for @xmath92 , the target state is also evolving with time , but for @xmath93 the dynamics is still confined to the subspace @xmath62 spanned by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the dynamics can again be reduced to a 2d subspace on which we have @xmath94 as well as @xmath95 where the orbit of @xmath34 is the equator of the bloch sphere .    from the analysis in @xcite",
    "we can conclude that all solutions in @xmath62 will converge to the equator of the bloch sphere , i.e. , states of the form @xmath96 which corresponds to the lasalle invariant set @xmath44 of the original problem satisfying @xmath97 thus , we can no longer guarantee @xmath98 as @xmath99 , i.e. , that the state converges to a particular bell state .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows that the distance from the target state still decreases monotonically and exponentially but the asymptotic value of @xmath100 for @xmath33 now depends on @xmath49 and is generally larger than zero .",
    "however , since all the states in the set to which @xmath32 converge are maximally entangled , we can still steer the system to a maximally entangled state , and the concurrence still increases monotonically to one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) but the relative phase @xmath101 of the state we converge to now depends on the exact initial state and the feedback strength @xmath49 .     under lyapunov control for different values of @xmath49 for local control ( top ) and interaction control ( bottom )",
    "shows monotonic convergence to @xmath12 .",
    "insets show the error , i.e. , @xmath102 decreases effectively exponentially . ]    strictly speaking , as the control @xmath28 reduces to zero , the norm of @xmath103 will cease to be significantly smaller than that of @xmath88 , rendering the approximations made in the derivation of @xmath88 invalid , unless we reduce the strength of @xmath103 accordingly .",
    "however , in practice , the system should already have reached a state with significant entanglement before the model becomes invalid .",
    "we have shown how to apply lyapunov control to the problem of generating entanglement between two distant two - levels atoms in cavities connected by optical fibers . given the lyapunov control design , despite the fact that the sufficient condition for a target state to be asymptotically stable",
    "is not satisfied on the whole state space , we can still ensure it is almost globally asymptotically stable on certain subspace .",
    "therefore , within that subspace we can drive the system from a product state to a maximally entangled state .",
    "the lyapunov control design has the advantage of much greater robustness compared to simple geometric schemes , and optimality in the sense that the distance from the maximally entangled target state is monotonically decreasing , and the convergence speed is exponential .",
    "we have discussed two control paradigms : to control the local hamiltonian , as well as to control the effective interaction hamiltonian between the two atoms . in both cases",
    "we can generate a maximally entangled state from an initial product state : for the formal case the system state will converge to a stationary bell state , while for the latter case the relative phase of the final state will keep varying under the hamiltonian , since the target state is non - stationary .",
    "moreover , in the latter case , the model becomes invalid when the control amplitude becomes sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , the former control paradigm is preferable .",
    "the lyapunov control design can be also used to steer partially entangled states to a maximally entangled state , however , the control is only effective for initial states in the subspace where the target state is asymptotically stable .",
    "this is not a limitation of the control design , however , but a consequence of the fact that the controlled system is decomposable into two orthogonal subspaces on each of which the dynamics is invariant . in this sense ,",
    "the lyapunov control design is as effective as is possible within the constraints of the model ."
