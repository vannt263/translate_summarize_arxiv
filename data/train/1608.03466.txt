    "after the confirmation of the higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) in run i data at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , it is pragmatic to move forward in searches of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) . in this context",
    "we already have well - defined models with rich particle spectrum which shall be supplemented through observed excesses in the experimental data .",
    "some of the excesses in run i data at the atlas and cms , namely , the excess in transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) spectrum of the higgs boson in @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite channel has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite by corroborating other source of excesses in heavy scalar searches through di - higgs boson production  @xcite and in associated production of top - quarks  @xcite .",
    "recent excess in di - photon channel around 750  gev  @xcite in early data of run ii at the lhc also provides hints of new physics bsm where it could be assumed to arise through a scalar or pseudo - scalar resonance around this mass .",
    "these excesses can be explained by introducing a particle spectrum bsm in an effective theory as well as in a proper model by considering the appropriate sources of constraints in the theory and known limits on parameter space in that particular model .",
    "it is evident that this new particle spectrum comes with new phenomenology and helps in not only explaining the observed data but also in searches beyond a particular model(s ) . in this",
    "proceeding we intent to address the phenomenology of scalars bsm , assuming the particle spectrum of two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) in addition with other real singlets @xmath0 and @xmath1 introduced in refs .",
    "before moving towards the phenomenological implications of the additional scalars bsm , we first discuss the particle spectrum and parameters introduced in a model dependent as well as in a model independent approach .",
    "a simple extension of the sm is known as the thdm with one more additional scalar doublet , where this additional scalar doublet transform under the sm gauge symmetries similar to the higgs field in the sm .",
    "after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , five physical higgs particles are left in the spectrum of thdm , two @xmath3-even states , @xmath5 ( heaviest ) and @xmath4 ( lightest ) , one @xmath3-odd scalar , @xmath15 , and one charged higgs pair , @xmath16 .",
    "the ratio of the two vacuums ( @xmath20 ) of corresponding doublets is a free parameter of the theory , @xmath21 in addition with the masses of the scalars - even scalars @xmath4 and @xmath5 may have different interpretations in terms of masses in comparison to the sm higgs boson . in our case",
    "we assume the lighter @xmath4 to aligned with the sm higgs boson . ] and the mixing angle @xmath22 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . based on different choices of symmetries and couplings to fermions different types of thdm",
    "is available , @xmath23 , type - i , type - ii , lepton - specific or flipped thdms . for more details of this model",
    "we refer the refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a model - independent approach",
    "i.e. @xmath24 an effective theory the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite introduced three real scalars @xmath25 may not be same as thdm heavier @xmath3-even scalar .",
    "the difference is also noticed since in this approach it is considered to be a real singlet scalar while in thdm it is a part of doublet which appear after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking . ]",
    "@xmath0 - introduced as a dark matter ( dm ) candidate whose signature is a source of missing energy in the colliders , and @xmath1 - a higgs - like real singlet scalar . in these studies",
    ", it is found necessary to fit all data that the heavier @xmath5 should have a large branching ratio in the channel @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "however , this explanations can also be accommodated by introducing the on - shell participation of @xmath1 in the decay of @xmath27 . to achieve the fittings ,",
    "the free parameters of the theory are fixed by considering various observed limits in @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) resonance searches  @xcite and the dm constraints .    as an extension to this model - independent approach , it is interesting to add @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a thdm as a model - dependent scenarios . in that case",
    "all new parameters of interactions among these scalars follow the constraints from thdm with few additional parameters in the theory .",
    "the details of this model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath0 does not acquire vacuum expectation value ( @xmath2 ) while @xmath1 acquires @xmath2 in result there is small mixing between @xmath30 and @xmath1 is considered to obtain @xmath31 coupling which should respect the bounds from the higgs data .",
    "in this section we discuss the phenomenology associated with the scalars introduced in previous sections which is useful in explaining the observed data in experiments as well as to provide hints for searches at particular energy and parameter choices in the colliders like the lhc .",
    "the observed final states are highly dependent on the choice(s ) of masses of these scalars after production rates @xmath24 gluons , quarks or gluons and quarks .    following the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider following mass ranges for thdm scalars with additional real scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 to explain the phenomenology :    * light higgs : @xmath32  gev ( ) , * heavy higgs : @xmath6 , * @xmath3-odd higgs : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , * charged higgs : @xmath35 , * additional scalars @xmath0 , @xmath1 : @xmath7 and @xmath36 .    based on these masses",
    "we can study the branching fractions of thdm scalars into the sm particles and additional scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 as listed in table  [ tab : i ] with following production channels :    * @xmath37 , @xmath5 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 , * @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "a partial list of interesting searches are summarised in table  [ tbl : los ] which leads striking signatures of clean final states involving the scalars introduced in this proceedings .",
    "mostly we discussed leptonic final states with missing energy signatures through the decays of heavy scalars .",
    "the same - sign leptonic channels provides prominent signatures for any new physics models beyond the sm .",
    "apart from these search list    * it is interesting to constrain the parameter space of thdm and associated parameters with @xmath0 and @xmath1 by explaining the distortion in the @xmath17 spectrum of the higgs boson in @xmath42 and @xmath43 channels as in ref .",
    "also the consequences of introducing @xmath1 to explain the large branchings in the effective theory due to @xmath44 can be understood in both model independent and dependent approaches by allowing @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "* the first lhc data at @xmath47  tev observed an excess in @xmath48 final state peaked at the invariant mass around 750  gev  @xcite with the best fit width of the resonance as @xmath49  gev . here",
    "according to our parameter choice that resonance could be a @xmath3-odd scalar @xmath15 . and",
    "further based on the choices of mass and width of this resonance the model parameters can be constrained .",
    "few analysis of interesting final states with selected leptonic signatures are discussed in the ref .",
    "@xcite by considering @xmath50 with missing energy and associated @xmath5 production with top quarks and decays as @xmath51 . with this note",
    "we summarise our work in the next section .    [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this proceedings we discuss the phenomenology of the scalars beyond the standard model .",
    "these scalars are introduced in a model independent way as an effective theory and also in a model dependent approach - considering the two - higgs doublet model .",
    "a logical way of introducing @xmath0 and @xmath1 has been discussed .",
    "a list of search strategies has been drawn and based on recent observed excesses in atlas and cms data , a sketch has been suggested incorporating the mass spectrum of the introduced scalars . in most of the cases we considered the leptons with missing energy final states with a significant number of same - sign leptons",
    "make the searches to be clean and striking .",
    "here it is also important to summarise the present constraints on the two - higgs doublet model parameters from run - i data at the lhc . in ref .",
    "@xcite a summary of exclusion limits were presented for several searches on additional heavy higgs bosons in physics bsm . in the case of thdm ,",
    "two benchmark scenarios type - i and type - ii were considered .",
    "the type - i ( ii ) thdm is generally constrained to @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( all ) of the heavy higgs boson .",
    "these constraints have been obtained by considering the decay channels @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we hope that our work towards this direction in run - ii data will show interesting features .",
