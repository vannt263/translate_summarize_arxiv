    "since a long time electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout has been devised as the most direct tool to study the properties of nucleon pairs within nuclei at short distance and thus the dynamical src in a nucleus @xcite .",
    "two nucleons can be naturally ejected by two - body currents , which effectively take into account the influence of subnuclear degrees of freedom like mesons and isobars . direct insight into src",
    "can be obtained from the process where the real or virtual photon hits , through a one - body current , either nucleon of a correlated pair and both nucleons are then ejected from the nucleus . the role and relevance of these two competing processes",
    "can be different in different reactions and kinematics .",
    "it is thus possible to envisage situations where either process is dominant and various specific effects can be disentangled and separately investigated .",
    "various theoretical models for cross section calculations have been developed in recent years in order to explore the effects of ground - state @xmath6 correlations on @xmath7 @xcite ) and @xmath8 @xcite knockout reactions .",
    "it appears from these studies that the most promising tool for investigating src in nuclei is represented by the @xmath9 reaction , where the effect of the two - body currents is less dominant as compared to the @xmath10 and @xmath8 processes .",
    "measurements of the exclusive @xmath0o@xmath11c reaction performed at nikhef in amsterdam @xcite and mami in mainz  @xcite have confirmed , in comparison with the theoretical results , the validity of the direct knockout mechanism for transitions to low - lying states of the residual nucleus and have given clear evidence of src for the transition to the ground state of @xmath12c .",
    "this result opens up good perspectives that further theoretical and experimental efforts on two - nucleon knockout will be able to determine src .",
    "one of the main ingredients in the transition matrix elements of exclusive two - nucleon knockout reactions is the two - nucleon overlap function .",
    "the tof contains information on nuclear structure and correlations and allows one to write the cross section in terms of the two - hole spectral function @xcite .",
    "the tof s and their properties are widely reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite . in an inclusive reaction , integrating the spectral function over the whole energy spectrum produces the tdm .",
    "in @xcite the tof s for the @xmath0o@xmath11c reaction are given by the product of a coupled and fully antisymmetrized pair function of the shell model and a jastrow - type correlation function which incorporates src .",
    "only the central term of the correlation function is retained in the calculation .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment is used in @xcite , where the tof s are obtained from an explicit calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath0o @xcite , which includes , with some approximations but consistently , both src and long - range correlations ( lrc ) .",
    "the numerical predictions of this model are in reasonable and in some cases in good agreement with data @xcite .    although satisfactory , these first comparisons with data have also raised problems that require further theoretical investigation and a more refined treatment of nuclear structure aspects in the calculation of the spectral function .",
    "the study of the two - hole spectral functions including different types of correlations , however , requires substantial efforts in computational many - body physics and represents a very difficult task .",
    "a different method to calculate the tof s has been suggested in @xcite using the established general relationships connecting tof s with the ground state tdm .",
    "the procedure is based on the asymptotic properties of the tof s in coordinate space , when the distance between two of the particles and the center of mass of the remaining core becomes very large .",
    "this procedure can be considered as an extension of the method suggested in @xcite , where the relationship between the one - body density matrix and the one - nucleon overlap function is established .",
    "the latter has been applied @xcite to calculate the one - nucleon overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and to make consistent calculations of the cross sections of one - nucleon removal reactions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite on @xmath0o @xcite and @xmath16ca @xcite .",
    "various correlation methods , such as the jastrow method , the green function method , the correlated basis function method and the generator coordinate method have been used to obtain the one - nucleon overlap functions which are necessary for cross section calculations .",
    "the first aim of the present paper is to apply the procedure suggested in @xcite to calculate tof s for @xmath0o using the tdm calculated in @xcite with the jastrow correlation method ( jcm ) , which incorporates the nucleon - nucleon src . as a second aim ,",
    "the resulting two - proton overlap functions are used to calculate the cross section of the @xmath0o@xmath9 reaction for the transition to the ground state of @xmath12c .",
    "the cross sections are calculated on the basis of the theoretical approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the choice of the jastrow tdm is determined by the convenience of its analytical form obtained in @xcite , which makes practically possible the calculation of the tof s .",
    "of course , the reliability of the tof s obtained in our method depends strongly on the availability of realistic tdm s .",
    "so , the usage in our work of the jastrow tdm , though incorporating only src ( and using harmonic - oscillator single - particle wave functions in the slater determinant ) , must be considered as a first attempt to use an approach which fulfils the general necessity the tof s to be extracted from the tdm and to apply them to cross section calculations of two - nucleon knockout reactions .",
    "the method to calculate the tof s on the basis of the tdm is briefly outlined in section  ii .",
    "the results of the calculations of the tof s and the cross section of the @xmath0o@xmath1c@xmath17 reaction are presented and discussed in section  iii .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section  iv .",
    "in this section we present shortly the definitions and some properties of the tdm and related quantities in both natural orbital ( geminal ) and overlap function representations .",
    "the method to extract the tof s from the tdm @xcite used in this work is also given .",
    "the tdm is defined in coordinate space as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the antisymmetric @xmath20-fermion ground state wave function normalized to unity and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are creation and annihilation operators at position @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath23 includes the spatial coordinate @xmath24 and spin and isospin variables .",
    "the tdm @xmath25 is trace - normalized to the number of pairs of particles : @xmath26    since @xmath25 is a hermitian matrix its eigenstates @xmath27 form a complete orthonormal set in terms of which @xmath25 can be decomposed as @xmath28 the eigenfunctions @xmath29 are called natural geminals and the associated real eigenvalues @xmath30  natural geminal occupation numbers @xcite . as a consequence of the antisymmetry of the nuclear ground state , the eigenvalues @xmath31 obey the inequalities : @xmath32    the upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ ineq2 ] ) is actually reached only for systems which are maximally correlated , as , e.g. , the occupation number of zero - coupled pairs in the seniority formalism in the limit of large shell degeneracy .    of direct physical interest is the decomposition of the tdm in terms of the overlap functions between the @xmath20-particle ground state and the eigenstates of the @xmath33-particle systems , since tof s can be probed in exclusive knockout reactions .",
    "the tof s are defined as the overlap between the ground state of the target nucleus @xmath34 and a specific state @xmath35 of the residual nucleus ( @xmath36 ) @xcite : @xmath37    inserting a complete set of @xmath33 eigenstates @xmath38 into eq .",
    "( [ tdm ] ) one gets @xmath39    the norm of the two - body overlap functions defines the spectroscopic factors @xmath40    as in the case of the single - particle spectroscopic factors , where the latter can not exceed the maximal natural occupation number @xcite , one can find that @xmath41 .",
    "a procedure for obtaining the tof s on the basis of the tdm has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is due to the particular asymptotic properties of the tof s and is similar to the one suggested in @xcite for deriving the one - body overlap functions from the one - body density matrix .    in the case",
    "when two like nucleons ( neutrons or protons ) unbound to the rest of the system are simultaneously transferred , the following hyperspherical type of asymptotics is valid for the two - body overlap functions @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the magnitudes of the relative and center - of - mass ( cm ) coordinates , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , @xmath47 is the nucleon mass and @xmath48 is the two - nucleon separation energy .",

    "the procedure described in section ii has been applied to calculate the two - proton overlap functions in the @xmath0o nucleus for the transition to the @xmath74 ground state of @xmath12c .",
    "the tdm obtained in @xcite in the framework of the low - order approximation ( loa ) of the jastrow correlation method has been used . in @xcite",
    "the latter incorporates the nucleon - nucleon src in terms of the wave - function ansatz @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalization constant and @xmath77 is a single slater determinant wave function built from harmonic oscillator ( ho ) single - particle wave functions which depend on the oscillator parameter @xmath78 , having the same value for both protons and neutrons .",
    "only central correlations are included in the correlation factor @xmath79 , which is state - independent and has a simple gaussian form @xmath80 where the correlation parameter @xmath81 determines the healing distance and the parameter @xmath82 accounts for the strength of the src .",
    "the loa keeps all terms up to the second order in @xmath83 and the first order in @xmath84 in such a way that the normalization of the density matrices is ensured order by order @xcite .",

    "src are quite strong and even dominant for the @xmath3 state and much weaker for the @xmath4 state .",
    "moreover , the role of the isobar current is strongly suppressed for @xmath3 @xmath5 knockout , since there the generally dominant contribution of that current , due to the magnetic dipole @xmath123 transition , is suppressed @xcite .",

    "even though the contribution of @xmath4 @xmath5 knockout can become important and even dominant at large values of @xmath125 , it is clear that a tof where only the @xmath4 state is included is unable to give a reliable description of the two - proton knockout process .",
    "in contrast , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ cs_sup ] that the cross section calculated with the jastrow tof for the @xmath3 state is close to the sf and also to the sm+corr results at low values of @xmath125 , up to @xmath126 mev/@xmath82 , that is just in the region where the @xmath3 contribution is dominant . for @xmath127",
    "mev/@xmath82 @xmath4 knockout becomes dominant with all the different treatments of the tof .",

    "[ cs_sup ] and [ cs_nik ] .",
    "it can be seen that in both kinematical settings the @xmath3 component dominates at low values of @xmath125 , while the @xmath4 component produces a strong enhancement of the cross sections at high momenta .",
    "the contribution of the partial @xmath3 component is reduced with respect to the results in the left panels , where @xmath3 is fully responsible for the knockout process .",
    "thus , the cross sections calculated with the total tof from the jastrow tdm are somewhat reduced at low recoil momenta .",
    "also the contribution of the partial @xmath4 component is slightly reduced with the respect to the @xmath4 results displayed in the left panels .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath4 component to the total tof is , however , much more relevant than with the other theoretical treatments considered in the figures and the enhancement at high momenta turns out to be much larger .",
    "thus , the shape of the cross sections with the total tof from the jcm is flatter than with the sf and sm+corr results .    in comparison with the sf calculations , the cross sections with the jastrow tof are lower at low recoil momenta and much larger at high momenta , due to the larger contribution of the @xmath4 component in the tof .",
    "the sm+corr cross sections are higher than the other results at low recoil momenta .",
    "this is an indication of a stronger contribution of src in this calculation .",
    "this contribution , however , depends on the particular expression adopted for the correlation functions , that in the calculations of figs .",
    "[ cs_sup ] and [ cs_nik ] is exactly the same as in the calculation of the tdm . at high",
    "momenta the sm+corr cross sections remain always higher than the sf results , but generally lower than the results given by the tof from the jcm .",
    "although obtained from a calculation of the tdm within the jcm where only src are included the tof used in our calculations are able to reproduce the main qualitative features of the @xmath0o@xmath1c@xmath2 cross sections which were found in previous theoretical investigations and also in the analysis of the available data .",
    "this means that the procedure suggested in @xcite to calculate the tof s from the tdm can be applied and exploited in the study of two - nucleon knockout reactions .",
    "the large differences found in figs .",

    ". it would be interesting to apply the procedure used in this work for the calculation of the tof s to more refined treatments of the tdm .",
    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows :    * the two - nucleon overlap functions ( and their norms , the spectroscopic factors ) corresponding to the knockout of two protons from the ground state of @xmath0o and the transition to the ground state of @xmath12c are calculated using the recently established relationship @xcite between the tof s and the tdm . in the calculations the tdm obtained within the jcm @xcite is used .",

    "calculations are performed in two different kinematics that have been realized for the cross section measurements at nikhef and mami .",
    "the results are compared with the cross section calculated , within the same theoretical model for the reaction mechanism , with different treatments of the tof , in particular with the tof obtained from a calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath0o @xcite where both src and lrc are included .",
    "the calculated cross sections are very sensitive to the theoretical treatment and different results are produced by the different tof s .",
    "the cross sections calculated in the present work , where the tof s are extracted from the jastrow tdm , confirm the dominant contribution of @xmath128 @xmath5 knockout at low values of recoil momentum up to @xmath130 mev/@xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath129 contribution is mainly responsible for the high - momentum part of the cross section at @xmath131 mev/@xmath82 . *",

    "it can be used also for the excited states .",
    "our main aim was to check the practical application of all steps of the method for a given state of the residual nucleus .",
