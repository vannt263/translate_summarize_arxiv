    "eclipsing binaries are ideal astrophysical laboratories , and even more than a century of their intensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring , they still represent the best method to determine the masses , radii and luminosities of stars .",
    "thanks to modern ground- ( and space- ) based telescopes we are able to discover these objects in other galaxies and to apply the same methods as used in our solar neighborhood .",
    "one very specific method is the analysis of their orbital periods . using the precise times of minima ( centers of the eclipses of the components )",
    ", we can determine if the system s period is constant , accelerating , decelerating , or periodically alternating .",
    "if we detect a periodic shifting of the times of minima , we determine that there is an additional component in the system , which is orbiting around the barycenter with the eclipsing pair .",
    "if the system is moderately inclined to the observer , the light from the eclipsing binary needs more and less time to reach us , as it moves away and closer to the observer as it orbits the unseen component .",
    "this method is in fact the same as used in the 17th century by ole r@xmath0mer when measuring the finite speed of light using the eclipse times of jupiter s moons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "dealing with the eclipsing binaries , we have a few advantages .",
    "first of all , there are currently thousands of eclipsing binaries known . moreover , the time baseline of observations for some eclipsing binaries is more than a century long .",
    "importantly , the observations are very easy to obtain , even with small telescopes .",
    "this is the case of one very interesting eclipsing system v994  her ( hd 170314 , ads 11373 ab ; @xmath1  mag ) . in 2008 it was discovered @xcite that v994  her is the first ( at that time ) system consisting of two eclipsing binaries . from one point on the sky we can see two different sets of eclipses , one with the period of @xmath2 = 2.08 days , while the other one has a period of @xmath3 = 1.42 days .",
    "the star was also observed with the hipparcos satellite @xcite , however the strange eclipsing behavior was missed for about 15 years .",
    "the complete study of this interesting system was made @xcite also on the basis of their new spectroscopic observations , yielding a set of physical parameters of all four eclipsing components .",
    "their study showed that the system consists of two pairs : a ( b8v + a0v ) , and b ( a2v + a4v ) .",
    "all components are well - detached and still located on the main sequence",
    ". both orbits are slightly eccentric .",
    "on the other hand , one important question arises , whether the two eclipsing components comprise one gravitationally bounded system , or the system is only an optical binary .",
    "the mutual orbital period of the two pairs can be very long and long - time monitoring is rather time consuming .",
    "the system v994  her also contains one more distant component observed interferometrically ( @xcite ) , whose period was estimated of about a few thousand years .",
    "therefore , the authors @xcite speculated that the two eclipsing pairs could be identified with these two visual components . for a brief review of quadruple systems with two eclipsing binaries see .",
    "currently we know only six such systems , bv + bw dra , v994 her , czev343 , kic 4247791 , tyc 3807 - 759 - 1 @xcite , and ogle lmc - ecl-16549 @xcite , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "here we introduce an original approach of delay - time variations of both eclipsing pairs , showing that the system is in fact quintuple and the two inner pairs are orbiting around each other with much shorter period .",
    "we obtained many new observations of both pairs , as well as re - analyzed the hipparcos and asas @xcite photometry .",
    "the individual times of minima are presented in table [ minima ] .",
    "these data were analyzed simultaneously in a combined approach of fitting both orbits together , using a well - known method usually called `` light - time effect '' , or `` light - travel - time effect '' ( hereafter ltte ) , described elsewhere , e.g. @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this method has been used for dozens of binaries in the past , however , v994  her is the first eclipsing binary system , where the method can be applied to both binaries .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that both eclipsing pairs serve as strictly periodic `` stellar lighthouses '' , whose apparent period changes can be studied .",
    "we used our new code for computing this combined approach of deriving both inner orbits ( their periods , and apsidal motion ) , together with the long orbit of mutual motion of the two pairs . altogether 15 parameters were fitted , using all available times - of - minima observations ( for a and b pairs : ( 25 + 36 ) published minima together with ( 18 + 17 ) our new unpublished data points ) .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the o - c diagrams for a and b pairs , showing their period changes ( the y - axis ) with respect to the time ( the x - axis ) . in these plots",
    "the positive y values indicate that the detected signal occurs later , while the negative values indicate earlier detection than predicted from strictly periodic linear behavior . as one can see , the rapid period changes near the periastron passage are clearly visible for both pairs .",
    "most of the parameters for the ltte fits for a and b are mostly the same .",
    "the exceptions are the omega angles ( the argument of periastron , @xmath4 = @xmath5 + 180@xmath6 ) , and the ( @xmath7 ) amplitudes ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , see below ) .",
    "the long - term modulation arises from the apsidal motion of the inner orbits , because both are slightly eccentric . for the final parameters of the fit",
    "see table [ tab_param ] .",
    "the main result of our analysis is the discovery that the two eclipsing pairs orbit around each other and show also detectable period modulation together with a slow apsidal motion .",
    "the period of the motion of apsides for pair a resulted in about ( 627 @xmath10 439 ) years , while for pair b the period is about ( 113 @xmath10 10 ) years ."
