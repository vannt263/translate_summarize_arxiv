    "in non - central heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) of bnl the particle distributions exhibit quite large anisotropies  @xcite . the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of particles ,",
    "so called elliptic flow , has been extensively studied  @xcite since it is sensitive to the early dense stage of the evolution  @xcite .",
    "recently also higher harmonics have been measured  @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that they should be even more sensitive to the initial configuration of the system  @xcite .",
    "ideal fluid hydrodynamics has been particularly successful in describing the observed anisotropy of particles at low @xmath2 in minimum bias collisions  @xcite .",
    "this success has been interpreted as a sign of formation of thermalized matter rapidly after the primary collision  @xcite .",
    "studies of both single particle spectra and anisotropies have also shown that a reasonable reproduction of data favours an equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter with a phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations of the eos of strongly interacting matter support such a scenario by predicting a phase transition at @xmath4 mev temperature . for a physical scenario of two light and one heavier quark ,",
    "the phase transition is predicted to be a smooth crossover at small values of baryochemical potential .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , lattice qcd predicts that pressure and energy density do not reach their ideal stefan - boltzmann values immediately above the critical temperature , but approach them slowly  @xcite .    at mid - rapidity at collisions at rhic ,",
    "the net baryon density is small and the relevant eos should exhibit a crossover transition .",
    "however , so far all hydrodynamical calculations of elliptic flow  @xcite have used an eos with a strong first order phase transition and ideal parton gas to describe the plasma phase .",
    "the usual point of view has been that it is unlikely that the details of phase transition would lead to significant dynamical effects  @xcite .",
    "this standpoint has been supported by the early calculations  @xcite where it was found that the width of the phase transition region , @xmath5 , had only little effect on the final flow pattern in one dimensional flow .",
    "thus it was considered safe to claim that the final particle distributions would not be sensitive to @xmath5 either .    however , full three dimensional expansion is more complicated than one dimensional .",
    "it is known that in three dimensional expansion the differential elliptic anisotropy , @xmath3 , of ( anti)protons is sensitive to the existence of phase transition and its latent heat  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of flow might thus be sensitive to other details of phase transition as well .",
    "in this paper we address this possible sensitivity .",
    "we use a hydrodynamical model to calculate single particle spectra , elliptic flow and higher order anisotropies in @xmath6 gev au+au collisions using four different eoss with different phase transitions and plasma properties . as a representative of lattice qcd results",
    ", we use an eos based on the thermal quasiparticle model of schneider and weise  @xcite ( eosqp ) .",
    "this model is tuned to reproduce the lattice qcd eos and provides a method to extrapolate the results to physical quark masses .",
    "to facilitate comparison with earlier calculations we use as reference points the eoss q and h used in refs .",
    "eosq has a first order phase transition between hadron gas and an ideal parton gas whereas eosh is a hadron gas eos without any phase transition . to study the effects of the order of phase transition and slow approach to the stefan - boltzmann limits",
    "separately we also use a simple parametrisation for an eos ( eost ) where the hadron gas and ideal parton gas phases are connected using a hyperbolic tangent function .",
    "such an eos has a smooth crossover transition but the plasma properties approach their ideal values much faster than in eosqp .",
    "we find that the main sensitivity to the details of an eos lies in the differential elliptic flow of heavy particles ( @xmath7 gev ) where eosq with a first order phase transition leads to an anisotropy closest to the data .",
    "surprisingly , the lattice inspired eosqp reproduces the data as badly as purely hadronic eos .",
    "eost with a crossover transition leads to almost as good results as eosq .",
    "thus hydrodynamical description of elliptic flow does not require a strong first order phase transition , but it does require sufficiently large increase in entropy and energy densities within sufficiently small temperature interval .",
    "until recently the lattice qcd calculations were restricted to vanishing net baryon densities , @xmath8 .",
    "even if there are some recent results for @xmath9  @xcite , we limit our discussion to zero net baryon density for the sake of simplicity . since we are interested in the behaviour of the collision system at midrapidity at rhic where net baryon density is small , this approximation is unlikely to cause a large effect .",
    "thermal models suggest that around phase transition temperature , the baryon chemical potential is below 50 mev  @xcite corresponding to a quark chemical potential of about 15 mev . at these small values of @xmath10 the critical temperature",
    "is expected to change by less than a percent from that at @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "one of our eoss ( eos q , see below ) also includes extension to non - zero baryon densities .",
    "we have checked that for this eos , the results obtained when the finite baryon density is included in the eos or approximated by zero , differ by less than two percents .",
    "even if we do not include finite baryon density to the eos , we still have finite baryon current in our hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "this allows us to have different baryon and anti - baryon yields at freeze - out and thus finite net proton yields .",
    "so far the lattice qcd calculations with quarks must be done using unphysically large quark masses .",
    "the calculated equation of state must therefore be extrapolated to physical quark mass values .",
    "for this purpose we use the thermal quasiparticle model of schneider and weise  @xcite . in this model",
    "the lattice qcd results are described in terms of quasiparticles with temperature dependent effective masses and effective number of degrees of freedom . in this approach",
    "the eoss obtained in lattice calculations for pure glue  @xcite and different number of quark flavours  @xcite are well reproduced . since the mass of quarks is an explicit parameter in this model , it is easy to extrapolate the results to physical quark masses .",
    "here we use the quasiparticle eos for two light quark flavours ( @xmath12 ) and a heavier strange quark ( @xmath13 mev ) to describe the plasma phase of an eosqp .",
    "the quasiparticle model is compared to the lattice results in fig .",
    "[ hilakuva ] , where pressure and energy density are shown as a function of temperature .",
    "the lattice result for pressure  @xcite is extrapolated to the continuum limit by assuming a 10% correction , i.e. , @xmath14  @xcite , whereas the result for energy density is shown without such an extrapolation . when the quark masses in the quasiparticle model are set temperature dependent as in the lattice calculations , @xmath15 ( light quarks ) and @xmath16 ( heavy quark ) , the lattice pressure is nicely reproduced ( pqp , dashed line ) . when physical quark masses are chosen ( eosqp , thin solid line )",
    ", the pressure is larger than with temperature dependent masses .",
    "there is no quasiparticle result with temperature dependent masses available for energy density , but comparison of quasiparticle model with physical quark masses ( eosqp ) to the lattice shows nice reproduction of the lattice energy density just above @xmath17 but much larger density above @xmath18 .",
    "this can be partly explained by the missing extrapolation to continuum limit of the lattice result .",
    "if one assumes similar 10% correction than for pressure , the difference between lattice and eosqp is quite similar for both pressure and energy density at high temperature .",
    "the parametrized eost ( see later in the text ) is included for comparison s sake and is shown to lead to much larger pressure and energy density than lattice calculations .",
    "the large difference between eosqp and lattice below @xmath17 is intentional and not related to the quasiparticle model . in the present lattice simulations pions turn out too heavy and therefore their contribution to pressure and entropy is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus one may expect the lattice calculations to give too small pressure and entropy density in the hadronic phase below @xmath17 .",
    "the quasiparticle model reproduces also this feature of the lattice eos and one has to describe the hadronic phase using another model .",
    "we adopt the usual approach of using an eos of noninteracting hadron resonance gas to describe the hadronic phase .",
    "it has been shown that such an eos describes interacting hadron gas reasonably well at temperatures around pion mass  @xcite and that the hadron resonance gas approach reproduces the lattice results below @xmath17 if the same approximations are used in both  @xcite .",
    "the properties of hadron resonance gas depend on the number of particles included in the model . here",
    "we include all the strange and non - strange particles and resonances listed in the particle data book up to 2 gev mass .",
    "the details of constructing this eos can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to circumvent our ignorance of the behaviour of the eos around @xmath17",
    ", we use the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : we use the hadron resonance gas eos up to a temperature @xmath19 , the quasiparticle eos above @xmath17 and interpolate smoothly between these two regimes .",
    "in practice we choose the values @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev and connect the entropy densities of both models using a polynomial function .",
    "we require that the first , second and third temperature derivatives of entropy density are continuous to approximate a smooth crossover from hadronic to plasma phase .",
    "below @xmath19 we use the hadron resonance gas values for pressure and energy density . above this limit we obtain @xmath22 and @xmath23 by using the thermodynamical relations @xmath24 and @xmath25 . this eos is called eosqp in the following .    for comparison",
    "s sake we also carry out the calculations using the eosq and h used in refs .",
    "eos h is a purely hadronic eos without any phase transition .",
    "it is constructed by extending the previously described hadron resonance gas eos to arbitrarily high temperatures .",
    "eosq , on the other hand , is inspired by a bag model and contains a first order phase transition from hadron gas to ideal parton gas . the hadron phase is again described by an hadron resonance gas and the plasma phase by a gas of ideal massless quarks and gluons with a bag constant .",
    "to approximate the effect of the finite strange quark mass we use the number of quark flavours @xmath26 .",
    "the phase boundary is determined using the gibbs criterion @xmath27 and the two phases are connected using the maxwell construction at @xmath28 mev .",
    "details of constructing these two eoss can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eoskuva ] the quasiparticle and bag model inspired eoss ( qp and q , respectively ) lead to quite different behaviour around critical temperature .",
    "since we want to study the effects of the order of phase transition and slow approach to ideal stefan - boltzmann values separately , we construct yet another eos .",
    "we follow the idea presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and connect the hadron and parton phases of the eos by a hyperbolic tangent function .",
    "we refine this approach by using hadron resonance gas eos instead of ideal pion gas to describe the hadron phase . in ref .",
    "@xcite the entropy densities of hadron and parton phases are connected in this way .",
    "this leads to similar behaviour of energy density than the maxwell construction of eosq  above @xmath17 energy density rises above the ideal stefan - boltzmann limit and approaches the ideal values from above .",
    "there is no sign of this kind of behaviour in the lattice results .",
    "therefore we use hyperbolic tangent to connect the energy density of the different phases instead of entropy density .",
    "energy density is given by @xmath29\\ ] ] where the latter term is the energy density of ideal parton gas with 3 colours and 2.5 quark flavours .",
    "we use again @xmath20 mev and make the crossover rapid by choosing @xmath30 mev . after obtaining @xmath23 we again use standard thermodynamical relations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , to obtain entropy density and pressure as a function of temperature .",
    "this eos is called eost in the following .",
    "all four eoss are compared in fig .",
    "[ eoskuva ] where entropy and energy density are shown as functions of temperature and pressure and the square of the speed of sound are shown as functions of energy density for each eos . as can be seen the behaviour of the lattice",
    "inspired eosqp is quite different from the previously used eosq with a first order phase transition .",
    "the latter has a relatively large latent heat of 1.15 gev/@xmath33 whereas in the former the region where the speed of sound is small and the eos soft is much smaller .",
    "the parametrised eost is a compromise between these two .",
    "it can also be seen that above the phase transition region the eosq has the largest speed of sound and is therefore hardest whereas the eosh without phase transition is softest .",
    "it is worth noticing that eosqp depicts a smaller rise in both energy and entropy densities around @xmath17 than what could be expected from lattice calculations .",
    "this is not a property of the quasiparticle model used here , but due to the use of hadron resonance gas eos below @xmath17 . as mentioned before",
    ", lattice calculations lead to too high pion mass and correspondingly too small densities below @xmath17 .",
    "if realistic pion masses are used in hadron resonance gas , its pressure and densities are well above lattice results below @xmath17 .",
    "we use the same boost - invariant hydrodynamic code than in refs .",
    "@xcite and described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . to fix the parameters of the model , we require that the model reproduces the @xmath2 spectra of pions and net protons ( @xmath34 ) in most central collisions and the centrality dependence of pion multiplicity at midrapidity .",
    "we use net protons instead of protons and/or antiprotons because our model assumes chemical equilibrium to hold down to kinetic freeze - out temperature and is unable to reproduce proton and antiproton yields simultaneously .    some parametrisations to fix the initial density distributions were explored in ref .",
    "none of them reproduces the observed centrality dependence of multiplicity , but a linear combination of them does .",
    "here we use the same combination than in refs .",
    "the local entropy density is taken to scale with a linear combination of the density of participants and binary collisions in the transverse plane with weights of 0.75 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "this kind of scaling can be interpreted as particle production from `` soft '' and `` hard '' processes . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the initial baryon number density is taken to scale with the number of participants .",
    "the initial time of the calculation , @xmath35 fm/@xmath36 , is taken from earlier calculations for @xmath37 gev energy  @xcite .",
    "the freeze - out energy density is chosen to reproduce the slopes of pion and net proton spectra in most central collisions ( see upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ spektrit ] ) .",
    "the stiffer the eos , the sooner , i.e.  at higher density , the necessary flow velocity to fit the spectra has been built up .",
    "we find that effectively the eosqp is stiffest since it requires the highest decoupling energy density @xmath38 gev/@xmath33 ( @xmath39 mev ) to fit the data .",
    "even if the ideal parton gas eos is stiff , the mixed phase of the eosq makes it effectively the softest eos here .",
    "the stiffening of the phase transition region and softening of the plasma phase in the eost cancel each other .",
    "it is almost as soft as eosq and can use the same freeze - out energy density @xmath40 gev/@xmath33 ( @xmath41 mev ) .",
    "the purely hadronic eos h is in between these extremes and requires @xmath42 gev/@xmath33 ( @xmath43 mev ) to fit the data . as can be seen in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ spektrit ] , these choices of @xmath44 allow all eoss to fit the data equally well .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra for pions , kaons and net protons for various centralities are shown in fig .",
    "[ spektrit ] . pion and net proton spectra in most central collisions",
    "were used to fix the parameters of the model , but the data are well reproduced at other centralities too . only at the most peripheral collisions",
    "the data tend to favour flatter spectra than calculated .",
    "the kaon spectra was not taken into account when choosing the parameters and the calculated spectra is a prediction in most central collisions too .",
    "the fit to data is surprisingly good when one takes into account that the freeze - out temperature is well below the @xmath45 mev chemical freeze - out temperature where particle yields are fixed  @xcite .",
    "the net proton spectra is well reproduced up to @xmath46 - 3.0 gev except in the most peripheral collisions , where the data begins to deviate form the calculation at lower @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noticing that we are able to fit the @xmath2 spectra of net protons without any initial transverse velocity field whereas the fit of protons in ref .",
    "@xcite required a non - zero initial transverse velocity .",
    "one reason for this is that due to larger errors , it is easier to fit the net - proton than proton spectra .",
    "the main cause is , however , the different eos in the hadronic phase . in  @xcite , the authors assumed a separate thermal and kinetic freeze - outs and only a partial chemical equilibrium in the hadronic phase whereas in this work a full chemical equilibrium is assumed .",
    "although the relation between pressure and energy density is almost independent of these assumptions , the relation between temperature and energy density depends strongly on them  @xcite .",
    "thus the relation between collective and thermal motion in a hydrodynamical model depends on the assumption of chemical equilibrium or non - equilibrium and very different initial states can be required to fit the data .",
    "the second fourier coefficient , @xmath47 , of the azimuthal distribution of charged particles as function of centrality is shown as a histogram in fig .",
    "[ v2cent ] .",
    "note that the data measured by the star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite collaborations have different pseudorapidity and @xmath2 cuts . after these cuts have been applied to the calculations ,",
    "the results differ slightly .",
    "therefore the comparison with the data is done in two separate panels .",
    "the agreement with data is similar to that seen in @xmath48 gev collisions  @xcite : at most central collisions ( @xmath49% of cross section , @xmath50 fm ) the observed anisotropy is above the hydrodynamical result . at semicentral collisions",
    "the calculations fit the data ( 10 - 30% of cross section , @xmath51 fm , depending on the eos ) and at peripheral collisions the calculated anisotropy is well above the observed .",
    "one possible explanation for larger observed than calculated anisotropy in most central collisions is fluctuations in the initial state geometry  @xcite .",
    "the present experimental procedure can not distinguish between the enhancing and suppressing effects of fluctuations on anisotropy in most central collisions and consequently leads to too large value of @xmath47 .",
    "the sensitivity of the anisotropy to the eos depends on centrality . in the most central and semi - peripheral collisions",
    "eosq leads to the lowest anisotropy and eosh to the largest , but in most peripheral collisions the lowest anisotropy is achieved using eosqp .",
    "the stiffest eos does not always lead to the largest anisotropy and the softest to smallest because of the interplay of collective and thermal motion .",
    "stiff eos may necessitate decoupling at higher temperature when larger thermal motion dilutes the flow anisotropy .",
    "the momentum dependence of elliptic flow , @xmath3 , in minimum bias collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ v2piap ] for positive pions and antiprotons and in fig .",
    "[ v2kl ] for neutral kaons and a sum of lambdas and antilambdas . for pions the behaviour is similar to the charged particle @xmath3 at @xmath52 gev collisions  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the eos the calculated anisotropy reproduces the data up to @xmath53 gev where the data begins to saturate but the hydrodynamical curve keeps increasing .",
    "major differences between different eoss are at the high @xmath2 region where no eos fits the data .",
    "closer look at low @xmath2 region ( @xmath54 gev ) reveals that eosh leads to slightly larger @xmath47 than the other eoss , but the difference is equal to the difference between the star and phenix data .",
    "the antiprotons show much stronger sensitivity to the eos than pions .",
    "below @xmath55 gev the results form two groups .",
    "eossqp and h lead to almost identical @xmath3 which is clearly above the data whereas eossq and t lead to anisotropy very close to the data .",
    "the phase transition crossover in eost is very rapid with @xmath30 mev .",
    "we have tested that increase in @xmath5 leads to larger antiproton @xmath3 at low @xmath2 and worse fit with the data .",
    "for example @xmath56 mev moves the @xmath3 curve roughly halfway between results for eosq and qp . at high values of @xmath2",
    "the order of results is changed with eosq leading to highest and eosh to the lowest anisotropy .",
    "the antiproton data follows the hydrodynamical calculation to much higher values of @xmath2 than the pion data .",
    "even the highest data point at @xmath57 gev is fitted while using eosqp or h.    even when eosq is used , we can not reproduce the antiproton @xmath3 as well as in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that in ref .",
    "@xcite freeze - out temperature was lower @xmath58 mev , but after constraining the freeze - out to fit the @xmath2 spectra we are forced to use higher freeze - out temperature which does not allow as good description of the @xmath47 data .",
    "the general behaviour of antiproton @xmath3 suggests that the larger the latent heat , the smaller the @xmath3 at low @xmath2 .",
    "however , this is not the case . to test this hypothesis we used also an eos with a first order phase transition and larger latent heat than eosq ( 2 gev/@xmath33 instead of 1.15 gev/@xmath33 ) .",
    "the fit to antiproton anisotropy was no better than for eosq ( similar behaviour was already seen in ref .",

    "comparison with the strange particle data ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) in fig .",
    "[ v2kl ] shows similar trends .",
    "the larger the particle mass the larger the differences between eoss at low @xmath2 .",
    "the data deviates from the overall behaviour of hydrodynamical calculation at lower @xmath2 for mesons than for baryons ",
    "the kaon data deviates already around @xmath61 gev whereas hydrodynamical calculation is close to lambda data up to @xmath62 gev . on the other hand",
    "the overall fit to data is worse for strange than non - strange particles .",
    "even eosq leads to calculated anisotropy which is above the data also at low @xmath2 .",
    "smaller @xmath47 at low @xmath2 can not be interpreted as a sign of strange particles freezing out earlier at higher temperature . for kaons and lambdas that would mean _ larger _ @xmath47 at small @xmath2 .",
    "the good fit to kaon @xmath2 spectra is also against a higher kinetic freeze - out temperature for strange particles .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the different parametrisations of the initial state can lead to similar pion @xmath3 but different proton @xmath3 in minimum bias collisions .",
    "we have checked if it would be possible to bring the antiproton @xmath3 down to fit the data using eosh but different initial state as speculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . to do this",
    "we assumed that at each value of impact parameter @xmath63 , the initial energy density was proportional to the density of binary collisions in the transverse plane ( parametrisation ebc of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the proportionality constant depended on impact parameter to reproduce the observed centrality dependence of multiplicity .",
    "because this parametrisation led to steeper initial gradients than our usual parametrisation , we had to use freeze - out energy density @xmath64 gev/@xmath33 instead of @xmath65 gev/@xmath33 ( @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 mev , respectively ) to reproduce the @xmath2 distributions of pions and net - protons .",
    "as a result , the earlier decoupling negated the change due to the different initial shape and the final proton @xmath3 was almost similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ v2piap ] and well above the data .",
    "we conclude that the anisotropies shown in figs .",
    "[ v2piap ] and [ v2kl ] are typical for each eos and robust against small variations in the initial parametrisation of the system .",
    "55 mm    recently there has been interest in measuring the higher harmonics of the azimuthal distribution of particles  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that these higher coefficients should be even more sensitive to the initial configuration of the system than the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of these coefficients would require checking how different initial configurations would affect these coefficients .",

    "eost on the other hand is somewhere in between these two with the slow rise at low @xmath86 and very rapid rise at large @xmath86 but with much weaker structure around @xmath85 fm .",
    "even if the flow velocity distributions shown in fig .  [ profiles ] do not look too different from each other , the amount of particles emitted from fluid elements at different velocities is very different . to characterise this , the velocity curves in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] are divided into segments so that each segment corresponds to 20% of entropy flowing through surface and thus @xmath87% of particles emitted .",
    "also the entropy flow as function of flow velocity on the decoupling surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy ] .",
    "as can be seen eosq leads to very different distribution with much more particles being emitted at small flow velocities .",
    "especially the `` shoulder '' in flow profile around @xmath88 fm leads to a peak in entropy distribution at @xmath89 whereas eoss qp and h lead to distributions peaking at @xmath90 , close to maximum values of flow velocity .",
    "eost is again a compromise between these two extremes .",
    "the entropy flow has a peak both at the `` shoulder '' at @xmath91 and close to maximum velocity at @xmath92 .",
    "the largest flow velocity is also larger than for eoss qp and h and close to the maximum for eosq . the flow on decoupling surface is thus weighted very differently for each eos and the average values of flow velocity and anisotropy do not completely describe @xmath2 differential anisotropies of particles .    in ref .",
    "@xcite similar velocity profiles were considered linear and corroborating the general use of linear velocity profiles in hydrodynamically inspired fits to particle spectra . as seen here",
    "the deviations from linear behaviour are important at least in non - central collisions .",
    "thus the parameter values from fits can deviate from values obtained in full - fledged hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "in this paper we have examined how the order of deconfinement phase transition affects the anisotropy in a hydrodynamical description of relativistic nuclear collision .",
    "we used four different equations of state ",
    "one lattice inspired eos with a crossover transition from hadronic to partonic phase ( eosqp ) , one where a simple maxwell construction between different phases creates a first order phase transition ( eosq ) , a purely hadronic eos with no phase transition at all ( eosh ) and an eos where different phases were smoothly connected with a hyperbolic tangent function ( eost ) .",
    "the @xmath2 distributions of various particles could be reproduced equally well using each of these eoss when the freeze - out density was chosen accordingly .",
    "our result is thus different from ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath2 distributions were sensitive to the amount of latent heat of the eos .",
    "this difference is due to different treatment of freeze - out . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic stage was described using rqmd cascade model which does not have freeze - out temperature or density as a free parameter .",
    "the main sensitivity to the eos was seen in the differential anisotropy of heavy particles at low @xmath2 , i.e. antiprotons and lambdas .",
    "none of the eoss was able to reproduce the data , but the eos with the first order phase transition , eosq was closest . surprisingly the lattice based eosqp was as far from the proton @xmath47 data as the eosh without any phase transition .",
    "the basic rule was that the sharper the rapid rise in entropy and energy density at phase transition and the larger the latent heat , the lower the differential anisotropy of antiprotons at low @xmath2 was .",
    "this , however , is valid only among the eoss discussed here .",
    "the results here favour eosq and first order phase transition over lattice inspired eosqp .",
    "one should not interpret this to mean that hydrodynamical description of elliptic flow requires a first order phase transition since eost with a crossover transition lead to only marginally worse results than eosq .",
    "the main difference between eoss qp and t is in the size of the increase in energy and entropy densities around the critical temperature and consequently how wide is the region where the speed of sound is small .",
    "thus the acceptable description of elliptic flow seems to require very fast and sufficiently large increase in entropy and energy densities around @xmath17 .",
    "however , these results must be taken as only preliminary .",
    "for simplicity hadron gas was assumed to maintain chemical equilibrium until kinetic freeze - out in these calculations . as mentioned in section  [ init ] , this assumption does not allow the reproduction of observed particle yields but only the slopes of their spectra and approximatively their anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "the recent calculations where this assumption is relaxed and a separate chemical and kinetic freeze - outs included in the model  @xcite , have lead to much worse description of the data  @xcite .",
    "it looks like it is very difficult to describe the data using ideal fluid hydrodynamics while the hadron gas is not in chemical equilibrium  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the hadronic phase is described using rqmd cascade which allows chemical non - equilibrium , the data is again reproduced  @xcite .",
    "thus the correct treatment of the hadronic phase in a hydrodynamical model is an open question and it is not yet possible to draw final conclusions about the details of the eos based on the observed anisotropies .    nevertheless our results point to that a large and rapid increase in densities around critical temperature is necessary in hydrodynamical description to describe the observed anisotropies .",
    "the failure of lattice inspired eos to do this raises the questions whether the lattice result used here is sufficiently accurate around @xmath17 , whether the hadron resonance gas description of the eos below @xmath17 is inaccurate or whether some finite size effects make the eos relevant for heavy ion collisions differ from lattice qcd results .",
    "i am grateful for thorsten renk and roland schneider for allowing us to use a parametrisation of their quasiparticle eos .",
    "fruitful discussions with p.  v.  ruuskanen , r.  snellings and s.  s.  rsnen are also thankfully acknowledged .",
