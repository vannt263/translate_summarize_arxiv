    "since its establishment in the early decades of the last century , quantum theory has been elevated to the status of the `` most precisely tested and most successful theory in the history of science '' @xcite . and",

    "is quantum entanglement @xcite , nowadays a crucial resource in quantum information and computation @xcite but that also plays a central role in the foundations of the theory .",
    "for instance , as shown by the celebrated bell s theorem@xcite , quantum correlations between distant parts of an entangled system can violate bell inequalities , thus precluding its explanation by any local hidden variable ( lhv ) model , the phenomenon known as quantum non - locality .",
    "given its fundamental importance and practical applications in the most varied tasks of quantum information @xcite , not surprisingly many generalizations of bell s theorem have been pursued over the years .",
    "bell s original scenario involves two distant parties that upon receiving their shares of a joint physical system can measure one out of possible dichotomic observables .",
    "natural generalizations of this simple scenario include more measurements per party @xcite and sequential measurements @xcite , more measurement outcomes @xcite , more parties @xcite and also stronger notions of quantum non - locality @xcite .",
    "all these different generalizations share the common feature that the correlations between the distant parties are assumed to be mediated by a single common source of states ( see , for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig_dags]a ) .",
    "however , as it is often in quantum networks @xcite , the correlations between the distant nodes is not given by a single source but by many independent sources which distribute entanglement in a non - trivial way across the whole network and generate strong correlations among its nodes ( figs .",
    "[ fig_dags]b - d ) .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of its clear relevance , such networked scenario is far less explored .",
    "the simplest networked scenario is provided by entanglement swapping @xcite , where two distant parties , alice and charlie , share entangled states with a central node bob ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_dags]b ) . upon measuring in an entangled basis and conditioning on his outcomes",
    ", bob can generate entanglement and non - local correlations among the two other distant parties even though they had no direct interactions .",
    "to contrast classical and quantum correlation in this scenario , it is natural to consider classical models consisting of two independent hidden variables ( figs .",
    "[ fig_dags]b ) , the so - called bilocality assumption @xcite .",
    "the bilocality scenario and generalizations to networks with an increasing number @xmath0 of independent sources of states ( figs .",
    "[ fig_dags]d ) , the so called n - locality scenario @xcite allow for the emergence of a new kind of non - local correlations .",
    "for instance , correlations that appear classical according to usual lhv models can display non - classicality if the independence of the sources is taken into account , a result experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "however , previous works on the topic have mostly focused on developing new tools for the derivation of inequalities characterizing such scenarios and much less attention has been given to understand what are the quantum correlations that can be achieved in such networks .",
    "that is precisely the aim of the present work .",
    "we consider in details the bilocality scenario and the bilocality inequality derived in @xcite and characterize the non - bilocal behavior of general qubit quantum states when the parties perform different kinds of projective measurements .",
    "first of all we show that the correlations arising in an entanglement swapping scenario , i.e. when bob performs a bell - state measurement ( bsm ) , form a strict subclass of those correlations which can be achieved by performing separable measurements in all stations . focusing on this wider class of correlations , we derive a theorem characterizing the maximal violation of the bilocality inequality @xcite that can be achieved from a general two - qubit quantum states shared among the parties .",
    "this leads us to obtain a characterization for the violation of the bilocality inequality in relation to the violation of the chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "finally we show how our maximization method can be extended to the star network case @xcite , a @xmath0-partite generalization of the bilocality scenario , deriving thus the maximum violation of the n - locality inequality that can be extracted from this network .",
    "in the following we will mostly consider the bilocality scenario , which classical description in terms of directed acyclic graphs ( dags ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dags]-b .",
    "it consists of three spatially separated parties ( alice , bob and charlie ) whose correlations are mediated by two independent sources of states . in the quantum case , bob shares two pairs of entangled particles , one with alice and another with charlie . upon receiving their particles alice , bob and charlie perform measurements labelled by the random variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtaining , respectively , the measurement outcomes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "<S> bell s theorem was a cornerstone for our understanding of quantum theory , and the establishment of bell non - locality played a crucial role in the development of quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> recently , its extension to complex networks has been attracting a growing attention , but a deep characterization of quantum behaviour is still missing for this novel context . in this work we analyze quantum correlations arising in the bilocality scenario , that is a tripartite quantum network where the correlations between the parties are mediated by two independent sources of states . </S>",
    "<S> first , we prove that non - bilocal correlations witnessed through a bell - state measurement in the central node of the network form a subset of those obtainable by means of a separable measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to derive the maximal violation of the bilocality inequality that can be achieved by arbitrary two - qubit quantum states and arbitrary projective separable measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze in details the relation between the violation of the bilocality inequality and the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how our method can be extended to @xmath0-locality scenario consisting of @xmath0 two - qubit quantum states distributed among @xmath1 nodes of a star - shaped network . </S>"
