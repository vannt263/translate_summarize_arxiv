    "it has been demonstrated that the fragmentation functions at large momentum fraction play an important role in hadron production  @xcite .",
    "alternative models that attempt to describe these baryon to meson ratios include a phase - space determined parton coalescence picture  @xcite , as well as the dynamics driven models of recombination  @xcite , baryon - junction transport  @xcite , and hydrodynamic flow  @xcite .",
    "central au+au collisions are expected to provide a partonic medium where the coalescence of soft partons can occur .",
