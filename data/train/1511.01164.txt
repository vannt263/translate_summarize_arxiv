    "in our previous study we discussed various aspects of the covariant quark - parton model , see @xcite and citations therein . the discussion included distribution and structure functions ( pdf - parton distribution function , tmd - transverse momentum distributions , unpolarized and polarized structure functions ) in the leading order . for a fixed @xmath0 we obtained the set of relations and rules , which interrelate some of them , for example pdf withtmd : @xmath1 as we have studied in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present talk is to discuss a possible procedure for the @xmath2 evolution in the covariant approach .",
    "the starting point will be the use of a standard algorithm for the collinear qcd evolution of integrated distribution : @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "then , the evolved distribution @xmath4 is inserted into the original relation ( [ ei1 ] ) . in this way we have defined the procedure for the evolution of tmd : @xmath5 in the present study we will discuss unpolarized distributions only . in the next section",
    "we collect corresponding relations defining the procedure ( [ ei1 ] ) in detail .",
    "the last section involves the numerical results and its discussion .",
    "the well known algorithm for evolution of the unpolarized pdf reads:@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the corresponding splitting function .",
    "we have shown @xcite that in the leading order approach the relativistic invariance and spherical symmetry in the nucleon rest frame imply@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability distribution of the quark momentum @xmath10 in the rest frame , @xmath11 denotes @xmath12 this relation is valid for any sufficiently large @xmath13 when the quark can be considered effectively free in any frame in the sense of ref .",
    "the relation ( [ e1 ] )  implies@xmath14 since@xmath15 integration by parts gives@xmath16 this equality together with eqs . ( [ e1 ] )  and ( [ e2 ] )  gives   @xmath17 or equivalently@xmath18    further , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) we proved the relation for the unpolarized tmd:@xmath19 where@xmath20 relation ( [ e4 ] ) with the use of ( [ e3a ] ) give the tmd evolution:@xmath21 note the same splitting function in convolutions ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) , ( [ e3a ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) , which follows from the fact the distributions @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 are equivalent , as a result of relativistic invariance and rotational symmetry .",
    "at the same time , in an accordance with eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , the evoluted tmd can be expressed directly by means of the evoluted pdf . in the next this relation",
    "will be used for numerical calculations of tmd evolution .",

    "for numerical calculation we have used the pdf set mstw2008(lo ) @xcite at the three different scales , which are displayed in fig.[fig1 ] . in the next figure ( fig.[fig2 ] )",
    "we have shown their representation in terms of the distributions @xmath23 calculated from the relation ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "finally , in fig.[fg3 ] we have displayed the corresponding tmds .",
    "one can observe two important features :    \\i ) the transverse moments of quarks satisfy the condition @xmath27 .",
    "this condition follows from the constraint @xmath28 and the condition of relativistic invariance and rotational symmetry as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results are well compatible with the predictions obtained within the statistical approach and presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand our results on tmd differs rather substantially e.g. from the results of the qcd evolution in ref .",
    "the possible resolution of this contradiction is that evolution considered here may be attributed to the soft non - perturbative component of tmds and even can be used to disentangle it from the hard perturbative component .",
    "apparently these discrepancies require further study .",
