    "for the chandrasekhar mass white dwarf ( single - degenerate ) progenitor model of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the location of the first flames greatly affects the outcome of the explosion ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the convective state leading up to ignition is highly nonlinear and the ignition results from a hot temperature perturbation near the center of the white dwarf .",
    "once the temperature exceeds @xmath1@xmath2  k , a hot spot burns faster than it can cool via expansion @xcite , igniting a flame . in earlier studies on white dwarf convection in sne ia ( @xcite , henceforth z09 ; @xcite , henceforth z11 ) , we performed three - dimensional , full - star simulations of the final @xmath13 hours of convection in a white dwarf leading up to the ignition of the first flames .",
    "we followed the nonlinear rise in the temperature approaching ignition and showed that the ignition is likely to take place off - center ( 50  km most favored , with a likely range of 40 to 75  km , and an outer limit of 100  km ) in an outward flowing parcel of fluid .",
    "our results differed from the two - dimensional wedge simulation of @xcite which argued that the ignition is closer to the center ( @xmath3  km ) , and is driven by inflow compression .",
    "it is important to understand how robust our results for the likely ignition radius are to resolution . with the recently implemented adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability in our low mach number code , maestro ( @xcite , henceforth n10 ) , we are now able to study the final minutes of convection up to ignition at unprecedented resolution .",
    "we are also interested in the likelihood of multiple ignition points .",
    "detailed visualizations of the evolution of the last few hot spots preceding ignition will be used to examine this scenario .",
    "previous studies with an anelastic code showed that a dipole flow dominates the flow ( @xcite , also seen in the follow - up studies shown in @xcite ) .",
    "our results for non - rotating white dwarfs also saw this feature . here",
    "we examine this structure at higher resolution .",
    "higher resolution is also important for resolving the turbulence and capturing the turbulent cascade .",
    "simulations have shown that the flame needs to accelerate considerably beyond its laminar value for the resulting energetics to match observations . the primary mechanism for this acceleration",
    "is thought to be instabilities and the interaction with turbulence @xcite .",
    "a popular view is that the flame interacts with turbulence generated by the flame itself via instabilities .",
    "the vast majority of simulations to date have only considered this flame - generated turbulence during the explosion phase .",
    "@xcite suggested that turbulent entrainment was the dominant mechanism for enhancing the burning rate , and that the local flame speed , whether laminar or turbulent , was largely unimportant .",
    "as the flame encounters lower densities and broadens , the turbulence may be able to directly affect the flame structure ( at this point , the flame is said to be in the `` distributed burning regime '' ) .",
    "the altering of the flame by turbulence has been the subject of many studies , both semi - analytic and one - dimensional calculations with a model for turbulence @xcite and multi - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "if the conditions are right , the flame may transition to a detonation in this regime @xcite .",
    "what are not well known are the characteristics of the turbulence that already exists at ignition from the centuries - long convective period .",
    "the very first flame(s ) that ignite will form flame `` bubbles '' that buoyantly rise away from the center as they burn outward .",
    "these bubbles will deform due to shear instabilities and interact with the pre - existing turbulence and wrinkle @xcite .",
    "if the turbulence is strong enough , it could potentially disrupt the flames or even quench them .",
    "additionally , the initial convective velocity field has been shown to introduce large asymmetries in the burning @xcite .    in this paper , we expand upon our previous studies of the final hours of convection leading up to the ignition of the first flames in type ia supernovae . in z09 , we used 13.2  km resolution ; in z11 , we used 8.68  km resolution . here",
    ", we use the amr capability of maestro to compute ignition statistics at 4.34  km resolution , and general flow field properties at 2.17  km resolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : numerical methodology ] we give an overview of the maestro algorithm , including our latest improvements for both regridding and adding an additional level of refinement to a simulation in progress . in section [ sec : results ] , we describe our new high - resolution simulations .",
    "we examine the ignition statistics and compare them to our previous results in order to show that we have achieved sufficient resolution in our determination of likely ignition radii .",
    "we determine the likelihood of multiple ignition points by examining the dynamics of the last few hot spots leading up to ignition .",
    "we provide visualizations of the convective flow field to gain a better understanding of the flow structure .",
    "we include a detailed analysis of the turbulent nature of the flow field , and discuss the implications for the first flames .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions and discussion ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "maestro is a finite - volume , amr hydrodynamics code for low mach number astrophysical flows . in our low mach number formulation ,",
    "sound waves have been analytically removed , allowing for a time step based on the fluid velocity cfl constraint rather than the sound speed cfl constraint , while retaining compressibility effects due to background stratification , reaction heating , and compositional changes .",
    "the algorithm is described in full detail in n10 .",
    "we note that the low mach number equations do not enforce that the mach number remain small ; rather , if the dynamics of the flow are such the mach number does remain small , then these equations are valid approximations for the evolution of the flow .",
    "thus , maestro is not suitable for post - ignition calculations , where we expect the mach number to quickly approach or exceed unity .",
    "also , our low mach number approach assumes that the background state is spherical ; thus , any deformation due to rotation is not accounted for in the background state .",
    "we now summarize the algorithm , and then describe the new procedures for dynamically changing the grids as well as adding an additional level of refinement to a simulation in progress . for the simulations in this paper , we begin with data from z11 , in which we computed the last @xmath13 hours of convection in a non - rotating white dwarf up to the point of ignition using 8.68  km resolution ( @xmath4 computational cells ; the problem domain is 5000 km on a side ) and no amr .",
    "we expand upon this simulation by adding a level of refinement a few minutes before ignition and examining the ignition statistics for a 4.34  km ( @xmath5 effective grid cells ) resolution simulation .",
    "next , we will add an additional level of amr to examine the turbulent flow field in a 2.17  km ( @xmath6 effective grid cells ) resolution simulation .",
    "computer allocation limits prevent us from running 2.17  km resolution simulations to ignition , even with the efficiency gains provided by amr .",
    "maestro is based on the boxlib software framework  @xcite , which provides infrastructure for block - structured amr applications , and includes linear solvers that scale to 100,000 cores on the current generation of supercomputers ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we use a finite - volume approach , where each computational cell stores the average value of a state variable in that cell .",
    "the domain is decomposed into a nested hierarchy of logically rectangular cartesian grids with computational cell width @xmath7 in each direction ( the grids at the coarsest level are associated with level index @xmath8 , the first level of refinement with @xmath9 , etc . ) , and a refinement ratio of two in each spatial direction .",
    "we solve a system of coupled pdes containing advection and reaction terms constrained by an equation of state that takes the form of a divergence constraint on the velocity field .",
    "this constraint is enforced using a projection method , which requires linear solvers to solve a variable - coefficient poisson equation .",
    "one feature that makes maestro different from standard amr hydrodynamics codes is the presence of base state variables , which are functions of radius and time , @xmath10 , as opposed to cartesian grid quantities which are functions of all spatial dimensions and time , @xmath11 .",
    "we represent base state variables using a one - dimensional , time - dependent array .",
    "the base state array has a constant grid spacing , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the finest level in the simulation , and due to the spherical nature of our problem , does not directly align with the cartesian grid .",
    "figure [ fig : grid ] shows a depiction of the cartesian grid , one - dimensional radial array , and a graphical representation of how they relate to each other .",
    "some base state variables are cell - centered , and others are defined on edges . each of the base state variables is computed directly from other base state variables and/or cartesian grid variables .",
    "the base state density obeys an evolution equation within each time step ( described below ) .",
    "we require frequent mapping from the base state to the cartesian grid , and vice versa . in n10 , we describe how we interpolate a base state quantity onto the cartesian grid , as well as a `` lateral average '' procedure that determines the average value of a cartesian grid quantity at a particular radius and maps that value onto the radial array .    in the following overview ,",
    "all variables are assumed to live on the cartesian grid , unless noted otherwise .",
    "maestro solves the equations of reacting flow constrained by an equation of state in the form of a divergence constraint .",
    "the species are evolved according to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density , @xmath16 is the mass fraction of species @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the velocity field , and @xmath19 is the creation rate of species @xmath17 due to reactions .",
    "we note that the density can be determined at any time using @xmath20 and thus density does not have to be explicitly evolved in time .",
    "we define a base state density , @xmath21 , that represents the average value of density at a particular radius .",
    "the base state density has its own evolution equation , as described below .",
    "the base state ( thermodynamic ) pressure , @xmath22 , is computed using the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath23 where the gravity , @xmath24 is computed by integrating @xmath25 assuming piecewise - constant profiles of @xmath25 within each radial cell .",
    "in general , given @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we could derive the temperature from the specific enthalpy , @xmath26 , evolved as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy generation rate from reactions . in practice",
    ", we adopt the prescription used in z09 , z11 and derive the temperature from @xmath29 and @xmath30 effectively decoupling the enthalpy from the problem . in the future , we will seek ways to evolve the enthalpy in a manner that minimizes the drift from the equation of state .",
    "the velocity field is evolved according to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the perturbational pressure , i.e. , the local deviation of the total pressure from @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the unit vector in the outward radial direction .",
    "the evolution of the thermodynamic variables ( @xmath35 , and @xmath33 ) are constrained by the equation of state , which we represent as a divergence constraint on the velocity field , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is a base state quantity that captures the expansion / contraction of a fluid parcel as it changes altitude , and @xmath38 is a local source term that captures the compressibility effects due to reactions and compositional changes .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is a base state variable representing the average at constant radius of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the entropy . a full derivation of this constraint",
    ", the form of @xmath42 and @xmath38 , and the numerical projection can be found in @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath25 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the base state expansion velocity , which accounts for the expansion of the atmosphere due to large - scale heating .",
    "we compute this term by integrating a one - dimensional version of the divergence constraint ( eq . [ [ eq : u divergence ] ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is a base state quantity that accounts for changes in background stratification due to large - scale convection ( see @xcite and n10 ) .",
    "the velocity field can be decomposed into the base state velocity and a local velocity , @xmath46 , that governs the local dynamics , @xmath47 we follow the approach in n10 , where we compute the evolution of these terms separately , and thus evolve @xmath48 subject to a perturbational form of equations ( [ eq : momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : u divergence ] ) .",
    "we note that the base state quantities @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are stored on radial cell - centers , whereas @xmath51 is stored at radial edges .",
    "to summarize , we advance equations ( [ eq : species ] ) , ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , and ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) , subject to equations ( [ eq : density ] ) , ( [ eq : hse ] ) and ( [ eq : u divergence ] ) .",
    "we use a second - order predictor - corrector approach in which we discretize the advection terms using an unsplit godunov method , compute the effect of reactions on a cell - by - cell basis using the vode stiff ode package , and couple these processes using strang splitting .",
    "we enforce the divergence constraint on velocity using a projection method , which uses multigrid to solve a variable - coefficient poisson equation for the update for the perturbational pressure , @xmath32 .",
    "regridding is the process of redefining the amr grid structure based on user - specified refinement criteria .",
    "the regridding algorithm also uses interpolation stencils to initialize data on newly created refined grids from underlying coarse data . here",
    "we have improved the regridding algorithm described in n10 and have also implemented a new algorithm for adding an additional level of refinement to a simulation in progress .",
    "our approach to amr uses a nested hierarchy of logically rectangular grids with successively finer grids at higher levels .",
    "this is based on the strategy introduced for gas dynamics by @xcite , extended to the incompressible navier - stokes equations by @xcite , and extended to low mach number reacting flows by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these works for more details .",
    "the complication in applying these methods to maestro is the presence of the time - dependent base state variables .",
    "we refer the reader to n10 for the maestro - specific implementation including details on creating and managing the grid hierarchy , communication between levels , and the implementation of amr with time - dependent base state variables .",
    "we note an error in the cartesian grid regridding procedure as described in section 5.1 of n10 . for problems with three or more total amr levels",
    ", we require that each grid at level @xmath52 be a distance of at least four ( not two as previously reported ) level @xmath53 cells from the boundary between level @xmath53 and level @xmath54 grids ; this allows us to always fill `` ghost cells '' at level @xmath52 from the level @xmath53 data ( or the physical boundary conditions , if appropriate ) .",
    "the major change regarding the regridding of the cartesian grid data is in the way we interpolate coarse data to fill newly created fine grids .",
    "our piecewise - linear interpolation algorithm applied to @xmath55 causes an artificial buoyancy term to appear in the momentum equation , leading to spurious velocities emanating from the coarse - fine interface .",
    "the basic idea of the improved algorithm is to interpolate @xmath56 and @xmath16 separately , rather than @xmath55 , to initialize data on the newly created refined grids .    the variables on the cartesian grid that we need to interpolate are @xmath18 , @xmath15 , @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the base state does not change structure , but we still need to recompute @xmath25 , @xmath33 , @xmath42 , and @xmath58 to be consistent with the data on the cartesian grid .",
    "we keep the original values of @xmath51 and @xmath50 . here",
    "are the steps for regridding :    1 .",
    "starting with level 1 and user - defined refinement criteria , tag all level 1 cartesian cells that satisfy the criteria for refinement .",
    "create the level 2 grids , and initialize the level 2 data by copying from the previous grid structure where possible . otherwise , use piecewise linear interpolation from underlying coarse cells to initialize any newly created refined regions , including ghost cells .",
    "continue to add additional levels of refinement in this way until all data on the grids at level @xmath13 are filled in .",
    "there is a slight modification to the interpolation procedure for @xmath59 where we first interpolate @xmath60 and @xmath61 to newly refined regions and then construct @xmath62 .",
    "2 .   recompute @xmath25 by calling the lateral average routine , then use equation ( [ eq : hse ] ) to compute @xmath33 .",
    "3 .   recompute @xmath63 and @xmath64 on each cartesian cell using the equation of state . recompute @xmath58 by calling the lateral average routine .",
    "then , recompute @xmath42 as described in n10 .",
    "4 .   compute a new appropriate @xmath65 .    the procedure for adding an additional level of refinement to a simulation in progress",
    "is largely based on the standard regridding procedure , except that now the base state array will have twice as many cells since @xmath66 is based on the resolution of the finest cartesian grid , i.e. , @xmath67 . to add one additional level of refinement to a simulation in progress :    1 .",
    "perform step 1 in the regridding procedure defined above , except allow for an additional level of refinement .",
    "2 .   define a new base state array with twice the resolution , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "call the lateral average routine to compute @xmath25 and use equation ( [ eq : hse ] ) to recompute @xmath33 .",
    "3 .   recompute @xmath63 and @xmath64 on each cartesian cell using the equation of state .",
    "call the lateral average routine to compute @xmath58 . then , recompute @xmath42 as described in n10 .",
    "4 .   the base state variable @xmath51 is edge - centered .",
    "we compute @xmath51 on the finer base state array using direct injection from the previous coarser base state array on aligning edges , and piecewise - linear interpolation on non - aligning edges .",
    "the base state variable @xmath68 is cell - centered .",
    "we interpolate @xmath50 onto the finer base state array using piecewise - linear interpolation from the previous coarser base state array . on radial cell centers and edges as separate arrays .",
    "we interpolate the radial cell - centered and edge - based arrays onto the finer base state arrays separately , rather than simply interpolate the radial cell - centered array onto the finer base state array , and then arithmetically average to get the radial edge - centered array . in the future",
    ", we will run in the latter mode for simplicity , noting that the effects of this change are very minor , and that both methods are second - order . ]",
    "compute a new appropriate @xmath65 .",
    "we now focus on one particular simulation performed in z11 , in which we computed the last @xmath13 hours of convection up to the point of ignition for a non - rotating white dwarf using 8.68  km resolution ( @xmath4 computational cells ) and no amr . as before ,",
    "we define ignition as the time when the maximum temperature exceeds @xmath69  k. here is a summary of our results from that simulation :    * the plots of peak temperature , peak radial velocity , and peak mach number as a function of time each exhibited a gradual , non - linear rise until the peak temperature exceeded @xmath1@xmath70  k. then , the rise in each field became much steeper , with ignition following shortly afterwards . *",
    "the first cell to ignite was 25.7  km off - center , and had an outward radial velocity of 5.1  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "* for the last @xmath13 minutes preceding ignition , the average radius of the hottest cell was 52.3  km with a standard deviation of 25.5  km .",
    "* histograms of the radius of the hottest cell during the final @xmath13 minute preceding ignition averaged over small time intervals indicated that * * the favored ignition radius was 50  km , with a likely range of 40  km to 75  km , and an outer limit of 100  km .",
    "* * nearly all of the hot spots had an outward radial velocity . *",
    "* these two results were consistent within any smaller time window within the final @xmath13 minutes .",
    "* visualizations of the convective flow field showed a dipole structure in the interior convectively unstable core , and a sharp boundary between the interior and the stably stratified outer portion of the star .    in this section",
    ", we examine the robustness of the ignition results at higher resolution .",
    "then , we use new visualization techniques to follow the last few hot spots preceding ignition to determine the likelihood of multiple ignition points .",
    "we also visualize the overall convective flow field to show the detailed fine - scale structure , as well as a more coherent picture of the large - scale features .",
    "finally , we analyze the turbulent spectrum to quantify the extent to which we have resolved the turbulent cascade , and discuss the effect that turbulence could have on the first few flames .",
    "we note that we do not consider a high - resolution rotating white dwarf at this time .",
    "a @xmath4 rotating simulation developed high velocities on the surface of the star at the poles , likely due to the deformation of the star . in our lower resolution rotating runs in z11 ,",
    "we saw a similar feature , but the velocities did not become large enough to restrict our time step as they do for the higher - resolution runs .",
    "a potential future solution to this would be to reformulate the base state in maestro to deal with equipotentials instead of a spherical radius .",
    "the 8.68  km resolution simulation in z11 followed the last @xmath110500  s preceding ignition .",
    "the simulation required @xmath16 million cpu hours on the jaguarpf cray xt5 at olcf . assuming perfect scaling and no amr overhead , a 4.34  km simulation from @xmath71 would require a factor of @xmath14 more computational resources ( since the time step is a factor of two smaller , and with our tagging criteria we have approximately the same number of cells at levels 1 and 2 , so there are twice as many total grid cells ) . due to computer allocation limits , running 4.34  km resolution from @xmath71",
    "is infeasible , so instead we add an additional level of refinement to an 8.68  km simulation at a time corresponding to @xmath1250  s preceding ignition .",
    "the edge of the star lies where @xmath72  g  @xmath73 , corresponding to a radius of @xmath74  km .",
    "we refine all level 1 cells where @xmath75  g  @xmath73 ( @xmath76  km ) , which more than encompasses the convective region ( the convective region boundary lies approximately where @xmath77  g  @xmath73 , with @xmath78  km ) .",
    "this new simulation has 4.34  km resolution ( @xmath5 effective grid cells ) .",
    "we note that since this problem is highly non - linear , we do not expect the ignition to occur at exactly the same time .",
    "in fact , the 4.34  km simulation takes @xmath1350  s to ignite .",
    "approximately 100  s into the @xmath5 simulation , we add another level of refinement , tagging all level 2 cells where @xmath79  g  @xmath73 ( @xmath80  km ) .",
    "this second new simulation has 2.17  km resolution ( @xmath6 effective grid cells ) .",
    "we run the 2.17  km simulation for @xmath180  s , and not to ignition ( again due to computer allocation limits ) .",
    "the resulting three - level grid structure is shown in figure [ fig : wd_2304_grid ] .",
    "the grids adaptively change as the simulation progresses , but since the overall base state density profile of the star is relatively constant ( as shown in z11 ) , the grids do not change significantly over time . some specific details concerning this grid structure",
    "are as follows .",
    "* the red grids are at 8.68  km resolution .",
    "there are 1728 red grids , each of which has @xmath81 grid cells ( @xmath1191 million grid cells total ) .",
    "* the green grids are at 4.34  km resolution .",
    "there are 1736 green grids of varying size , with a maximum of @xmath81 cells per grid .",
    "( @xmath1141 million grid cells total ) .",
    "* the blue grids are at 2.17  km resolution .",
    "there are 3646 blue grids of varying size , with a maximum of @xmath82 cells per grid .",
    "( @xmath1654 million grid cells total ) .",
    "by contrast , a simulation without amr at 2.17  km resolution would contain @xmath83 billion grid cells , or a factor of @xmath112 more grid cells than the amr simulation .    for the simulations in this paper",
    ", we use the recently implemented hierarchical approach to parallelism described in @xcite .",
    "we use a coarse - grain parallelization strategy to distribute grids to nodes , where the nodes communicate with each other using mpi .",
    "we also use a fine - grain parallelization strategy in the physics - based modules and the linear solvers , in which we use openmp to spawn a thread on each core on a node .",
    "each thread operates on a portion of the associated grid .",
    "grids at each level of refinement are distributed independently .",
    "this approach allows for maestro ( in particular the linear solvers ) to scale to @xmath1100,000 cores .",
    "all simulations were performed on the jaguarpf cray xt5 at olcf using 1,728 mpi processes with 6 threads per mpi process ( 10,368 total cores ) .",
    "we begin by reproducing some of the diagnostics used in z11 using data from the 4.34  km and 2.17  km simulations . in figure",
    "[ fig : temp_compare ] , we plot the peak temperature as a function of time for the 4.34  km and 2.17  km resolution simulations , and also include original 8.68  km resolution data for comparison .",
    "first , we see that over the last few minutes , the temperature profiles have the same general trend .",
    "the peak temperature value steadily grows with time , including fluctuations of several percent .",
    "once the star ignites , the peak temperature rapidly increases beyond @xmath69  k. we consider the local temperature peaks preceding ignition to be `` failed '' ignition points , i.e. , hot bubbles that are not quite hot enough to cause the temperature to run away .",
    "the ignition time for the 8.68  km and 4.34  km simulations differ by @xmath1100  s. due to the highly non - linear nature of this problem , this result is not particularly surprising . at the beginning of the 4.34  km simulation , we notice that the peak temperature curves track each other very well for the first @xmath180  s ( from time range 1020010280  s ) before the curves begin to show different behavior .",
    "this is not particularly surprising either since the 4.34  km solution begins as an interpolated imprint of the 8.68  km simulation .",
    "after @xmath180  s , we say that the peak temperature in the 4.34  km simulation has decorrelated from the 8.68  km simulation , and we expect the statistical properties of the hot spots near the center of the star to be consistent with an independent 4.34  km simulation initialized at time @xmath71 .",
    "we still expect the general convective flow field to look qualitatively similar for a longer period of time .",
    "the 2.17  km simulation shows similar behavior ; after initializing the simulation from the 4.34  km data , it takes @xmath140 seconds for the peak temperature curves to decorrelate .",
    "we would like to comment on the time step used in these simulations .",
    "using an advective cfl number of 0.7 , the average time steps over the time range 1030010380  s are approximately 0.027  s ( for the 8.68  km simulation ) , 0.016  s ( 4.34  km ) , and 0.010  s ( 2.17  km ) .",
    "the time steps do not quite change by a factor of two with refinement since the peak velocities do not necessarily lie in the refined convective region .",
    "we also want to comment on the efficiency of the low mach number formulation as compared to an explicit , fully compressible approach . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the 8.68  km simulation took a time step of a factor of @xmath170 larger than a compressible code , yet a low mach number time step takes approximately 2.5 times as long given the same computational resources , yielding an overall efficiency increase of @xmath128 over a compressible code .",
    "this comparison is especially meaningful because we compared to the castro @xcite compressible code , which is based on the same boxlib framework as maestro , and uses the same unsplit godunov advection formulism , same equation of state , and same reaction network ode solver .",
    "next , in figures [ fig : mach_compare ] and [ fig : radvel_compare ] we plot the peak mach number and peak radial velocity as a function of time .",
    "we see the same general behavior as in the 8.68  km simulation , where the peak mach number and radial velocity remain relatively constant until the final seconds preceding ignition , where the values rapidly increase .",
    "the next quantities of interest are the radius of the first ignited cell and its corresponding outward radial velocity . in the 4.34  km simulation ,",
    "the radius of the ignited cell is 41.3  km , with outward radial velocity of 9.5  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we compare these values to those reported in table 1 of z11 ; the 8.68  km simulation had an ignition cell radius of 25.7  km with outward radial velocity of 5.1  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we would also like to examine the ignition radius and radial velocity if we were to define ignition as @xmath84  k rather than @xmath69  k. however , by advancing the solution using our advective cfl condition , the simulation quickly becomes unphysical .",
    "specifically , if we continue to let the white dwarf evolve past @xmath69  k , over the next @xmath10.5  s ( @xmath160 time steps ) , the peak temperature steadily climbs to @xmath1@xmath85  k while the peak mach number holds steady at @xmath10.1 .",
    "then , over the next few time steps , the temperature unphysically spikes to @xmath1@xmath86  k , with the peak mach number quickly climbing to well over 1000 .",
    "our low mach number model has obviously broken down , so these results are not physical .",
    "to remedy this situation , and to advance our simulation to @xmath84  k , we apply a heuristic time step limiter , which attempts to reduce the time step so the peak temperature does not increase by more than @xmath11% each step .",
    "we limit the time step using @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the time step computed using our standard advective cfl condition , @xmath89 is the maximum temperature in the domain at the current time step , and @xmath90 is the maximum temperature in the domain from the previous time step . in doing this , we find that that we reach @xmath84  k at 0.57  s after @xmath69  k , the ignition point has advected to a larger radius ( 48.9  km ) , and the ignition point radial velocity has increased to @xmath91  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "these results are not surprising , given the ignition conditions at @xmath69  k reported above .    in z11",
    "we studied the time history of the hottest cell over the last few minutes .",
    "we gathered statistics to help us in our determination of likely ignition radii , and repeat the same diagnostics here . in figure",
    "[ fig : hotspot_radius ] , we show the radius of the hottest cell as a function of time for the final seconds preceding ignition for the 4.34  km simulation . in table 2 of z11 , we computed the average radius of the hottest zone , and its standard deviation , for the last 200  s and 100  s preceding ignition .",
    "for the 4.34  km simulation , over the last 200  s , the average hot spot radius and standard deviation are 54.0  km and 22.1  km ( as compared to 52.3  km and 25.5  km for the 8.68  km simulation ) . over the last 100  s , the average hot spot radius and standard deviation are 54.7  km and 22.5  km ( as compared to 54.7  km and 27.3  km for the 8.68  km simulation ) .",
    "this tells us two things .",
    "first , the hot spot statistics do not seem to change much whether we consider the final 200  s or 100  s preceding ignition .",
    "second , the results are very similar to the 8.68  km simulation , implying that we have sufficient resolution in our determination of likely ignition radii .    next , as in z11",
    ", we break the final approach to ignition into small time intervals and look at properties of the flow within each time interval .",
    "we consider the last 200  s preceding ignition , and use time intervals of @xmath92  s and @xmath93  s. within each time interval , we compute the average radius of the hottest cell , the average temperature of the hottest cell , and the average radial velocity of the hottest cell .",
    "we sort this data into histograms to understand the statistics of the last few hot bubbles preceding ignition . in each of the following figures ,",
    "we show histograms for both @xmath92  s and @xmath93  s. figure [ fig : t histograms ] shows histograms of the hottest cell , sorted by radius , with the colors representing the average temperature of the hottest cell over the averaging interval .",
    "figure [ fig : v_r histograms ] shows histograms of the hottest cell , sorted by radius , with the colors representing the average radial velocity of the hottest cell over the averaging interval .",
    "figure [ fig : t_ignitehistograms ] shows histograms of the hottest cell , sorted by radius , with the colors representing time to ignition .",
    "overall , the results are consistent with our observations in z11 , which we now summarize .",
    "some general observations :    * from each set of histograms , we see that hot spot is most likely to be found between 40  km and 75  km off - center .",
    "this is consistent with both figure [ fig : hotspot_radius ] and the histograms from z11 .",
    "however , we do not see the slight extended tail observed in z11 , which indicated a slight preference for the hot spots to lie at larger radii within the distribution .",
    "* for each set of histograms , we observe that the results are essentially the same regardless of whether @xmath92  s or @xmath93  s is used as the averaging interval .",
    "some figure - specific observations :    * in figure [ fig : t histograms ] , within each temperature interval , the overall shape of the distribution appears roughly the same , with a peak slightly greater than 50 km , indicating that hot spots of all temperatures can appear at any radius in the distribution . * in figure [ fig : v_r histograms ] , nearly all of the hot spots have an outward radial velocity . also , there is a tendency for the hot spots at larger radii to be associated with larger values of @xmath94 as expected , since the flow will carry them away from the center . * in figure",
    "[ fig : t_ignitehistograms ] , we see a reasonably symmetric distribution for all cases , indicating that the hot spot radius does not depend strongly on time to ignition .    next , we include a new histogram where we examine whether the hottest cell is increasing or decreasing in temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : dt / dt_histograms ] shows histograms of the hottest cell , sorted by radius , with the colors indicating whether the temperature of the hottest cell is increasing or decreasing with time .",
    "we observe that when the hottest zone is within 40  km of the center it is almost always heating up , and when the hottest zone is outside of 75  km it is almost always cooling down .",
    "this 40 to 75  km range is consistent with the previous histograms .",
    "another conclusion is that it seems highly unlikely that ignition will occur outside of 75  km since hot cells beyond that radius are most likely cooling down .",
    "this is in contrast to our result from z11 , where we claimed that 100  km was an outer limit for ignition radii .",
    "we are interested in the likelihood of multiple ignition points , so we now take a closer look at the dynamics of the last few hot spots preceding ignition . in the diagnostics we have presented , we have only been able to track the hottest cell in the simulation .",
    "we do not know , for example , if there are other hot spots elsewhere in the star that are almost as hot as the hottest zone .",
    "it is possible that at the time of ignition , there are one or more cells not directly connected to the ignition cell that have almost reached the ignition threshold . in a multiple ignition scenario ,",
    "such cells could also ignite very shortly after the initial ignition . since the white dwarf explodes within a few seconds of ignition",
    ", a multiple ignition scenario would require another ignition point to develop within the early phases of the explosion for it to have any meaningful impact .",
    "we wish to examine the temperature field very close to the ignition time to get a feel for how likely the multiple ignition scenario is .",
    "we have previously defined a failed ignition point as a spike in the plot of the peak temperature vs.  time that does not run away .",
    "we begin by examining the temperature distribution in the star during three failed ignition points preceding ignition .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_1152 ] is a zoom - in of figure [ fig : temp_compare ] for the final minutes preceding ignition for the 4.34  km simulation .",
    "three failed ignition points preceding ignition are encapsulated within the green , blue , and black dotted lines .",
    "we will examine the temperature distribution in each of these time ranges to see if there are hot spots elsewhere in the star .",
    "figure [ fig : hotspot_1 ] shows contours of temperature within the green dotted time region from figure [ fig : temp_1152 ] .",
    "we note that for all subsequent temperature visualizations , the blue dot represents the center of the star , and has a diameter of 4.34  km , corresponding to the resolution of the simulation .",
    "also , all visualization frames are spaced at 0.2  s time intervals .",
    "the main observation is that in the frames where an orange contour exists , indicative of a hot spot , that there are no other regions in the star with comparable temperature .",
    "this implies that if this hot spot were to run away , there would be only one ignition point .",
    "figure [ fig : hotspot_2 ] shows contours of temperature within the blue dotted time region .",
    "we do see that in the frames where an orange contour exists , there are other hot spots in different regions of the star . but as the hottest spot floats away and cools off , the temperature of the other hot spot does not increase .",
    "again , this implies only a single ignition point .",
    "figure [ fig : hotspot_3 ] shows contours of temperature within the black dotted time region .",
    "this visualization is more like the green dotted time region , in that there are no regions of the star with a peak temperature comparable to the main hot spot , implying there would be only one ignition point if this hot spot were to run away .",
    "next , we perform another simulation , beginning at the point of ignition , in which we have disabled burning for all cells where @xmath95  k. this will give us a picture of the dynamics of nearby hot bubbles that did not initially ignite .",
    "the idea here is to let the initial ignition point float away and see if any other hot spots reach the ignition temperature soon afterwards .",
    "the peak temperature in this new simulation is given by the black solid line in figure [ fig : temp_1152 ] .",
    "the visualization of the temperature field within the pink dotted time region from figure [ fig : temp_1152 ] is shown in figure [ fig : hotspot_4 ] .",
    "we see that the hot bubble containing the ignition cell floats away from the center of the star and cools off ( because the burning is disabled ) as it breaks up .",
    "more importantly , none of the other hot bubbles not connected to the ignition cell increase in temperature to the point of ignition . altogether , our analysis of the last few hot spots does not seem to support multiple ignition points , implying that this scenario is much less likely than a single ignition point .",
    "a caveat to this analysis is that our resolution is still several kilometers .",
    "it is possible that if one could increase the resolution far beyond what is possible today , even with amr , that many smaller hot spots could exist and the dynamics would be different .      in z09 , z11 , we provided visualizations of the convective flow field , noting the dipole feature observed in non - rotating white dwarfs .",
    "we recall that the convectively unstable region encompasses only an inner fraction ( @xmath96  km ) of the star . outside of this , the flow is stable against convection and dominated by large - scale structures with high circumferential velocities and a smaller radial component . figure [ fig : wd_convect ] shows visualizations of the 8.68  km , 4.34  km , and 2.17  km flow fields in the convective region at @xmath97  s. as before , we show contours of outward and inward radial velocity , as well as contours of increasing burning rates . as expected , the burning is strongest near the center of the star .",
    "now , we see the effect that resolution has on visualization of the velocity contours . both the large - scale nature of the flow as well as the smaller - scale eddies are much clearer with increasing resolution .",
    "this allows us to characterize the flow field as a plume , with a small solid angle region and strong outward velocity , with a lower speed recirculation .",
    "this is in contrast to a dipole , where we would expect the magnitude of the outflow and inflow to be more similar . in figure",
    "[ fig : wd_convect_rotate ] , we highlight the plume structure by showing the same 2.17  km flow field in more detail , where each frame represents a 40 degree rotation from the previous .    in figure [",
    "fig : hotspot_plane ] we observe that , for the 4.34  km simulation at the time of ignition , the ignition point lies in a region with positive @xmath94 ( consistent with our earlier report that @xmath98  km  s@xmath0 ) , and is almost aligned with the strongest outward plume .",
    "we expect this hot ignition point to accelerate radially outward to a significant fraction of the sound speed within a small fraction of a second ; this does not give the parcel of fluid at the ignition point enough time to change direction and align exactly with the strong outward plume .",
    "to get an idea of the structure of the flow outside of the convective region , we visualize the flow field in the @xmath99-@xmath100 plane . in figure",
    "[ fig : wd_convect_urut ] , we plot the radial velocity ( @xmath101 ) , as well as one component of the circumferential velocity , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction in the @xmath99-@xmath100 plane .",
    "both plots use the same scale for positive and negative velocities , so we see that the circumferential velocities outside the convective region are generally larger than the radial velocities within the core .",
    "these circumferential velocities in the stably stratified region may become important in explosion simulations in that they may deform hot bubbles or flames passing through that region .",
    "predictive models for sne ia , in particular turbulent flame models , depend critically on the structure of the turbulence in the star . in this section",
    ", we use the simulations to examine this structure and extract estimates for the turbulent intensity and the integral length scale .",
    "this will help us understand the state of the turbulence that exists at the start of the explosion phase .",
    "the vast majority of literature on turbulence theory deals with flows that are assumed to have constant density . in the present context , the significant variation in density due to stratification",
    "can not be ignored , and has to be dealt with carefully .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite advocated casting the energy balance equation in terms of energy density ( energy per unit volume ) as opposed to specific energy ( energy per unit mass ) , and we note that the difference is inconsequential for constant density turbulence .",
    "thus , the fundamental quantity relevant to the inertial range of a turbulent energy cascade is the energy dissipation rate per unit volume @xmath104 , which should be expected to scale with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the turbulent intensity ( rms velocity fluctuation ) , and @xmath107 is the integral length scale .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used numerical simulation of compressible turbulence to demonstrate that an appropriately density - weighted velocity spectrum obeys a kolmogorov - type five - thirds decay law .",
    "consequently , we consider a density - weighted velocity field , @xmath108,\\ ] ] and its fourier transform , @xmath109   \\quad [ { \\rm g}^n~{\\rm cm}^{4 - 3n}~{\\rm s}^{-1}].\\ ] ] we then define a generalized energy density spectrum as @xmath110.\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the volume of the domain in physical space , the domain of the integral , @xmath112 , is the spherical surface defined by @xmath113 , and @xmath114 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "this generalized energy density spectrum can only be made dimensionless using @xmath104 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 , resulting in the dimensionless group @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , plotting @xmath118 should present a five - thirds decay . henceforth , we only present energy density spectra appropriately weighted and omit the 1/3 suffix .",
    "we also note that only @xmath119 corresponds to a real energy density .    in the diagnostics in this section",
    ", we consider the local velocity , @xmath48 , rather than the total velocity , @xmath120 . in z11",
    ", we showed that the maximum magnitude of @xmath51 at ignition is @xmath10.013  km  s@xmath0 , so the effect of @xmath51 is insignificant on the scales we are interested in .",
    "energy density spectra from the 2.17  km simulation at @xmath97  s are shown in figure [ fig : spectra](a ) .",
    "the density - weighted velocity field has been decomposed into different components , specifically , the cartesian components , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , and spherical polar components ( using the convention that @xmath124 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the @xmath99-@xmath100 plane and @xmath125 is the inclination angle measured from the @xmath126-axis ) , @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "three energy density spectra are plotted : first , the mean of the cartesian components ( individual components do not differ significantly from that shown ) ; second , the radial component ; and third , the circumferential component .",
    "this decomposition demonstrates that there is significantly less energy in the radial component than in the other components .",
    "this is due to the large circumferential velocities in the layers outside the convection zone ; although the density is lower here , the volume is sufficiently large that the resulting energy has a significant contribution to the spectrum .",
    "it also appears that the radial component decays with an exponent close to five - thirds ( if slightly smaller ) , and the other components have a slightly higher exponent .    to circumvent the issue of large circumferential velocities in the stably stratified region , and to remove the signal from the coarse - fine interfaces at wavenumbers around 1152 and 576 , the energy density spectra of a subdomain",
    "were constructed .",
    "this was achieved by applying a smoothing function to the velocity and density fields in such a way that the data outside the convection zone were set to zero .",
    "specifically , each field was multiplied by the hyperbolic tangent function @xmath130)/2 $ ] , where @xmath131  km and @xmath132  km .",
    "all of the resulting non - trivial data were at the finest amr level , and the resulting energy density spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spectra](b ) .",
    "now , each spectrum collapses to a single curve , especially for @xmath133 , which corresponds to a length of about 250  km .",
    "the decay exponent of each spectrum is close to five - thirds and presents the characteristic `` bump '' between the inertial and dissipation ranges expected from developed homogeneous isotropic turbulence ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    to explore the effect of resolution on the turbulence in the convective core , figures [ fig : spectra](c ) and ( d ) present the total kinetic energy density spectra for the three resolutions , first without scaling ( c ) , and then scaled ( d ) .",
    "the spectra are scaled according to computational cell width and in keeping with a constant energy dissipation rate .",
    "specifically , the 4.34  km simulation spectrum is shifted to higher wavenumbers by a factor of 2 , and to lower energy density by a factor of 2@xmath134 , and the 8.68  km spectrum has been shifted by factors of 4 and 4@xmath134 , respectively . the unscaled spectra demonstrate that the large scales are independent of resolution ( as expected ) , in the sense that increasing the resolution does not lead to an increased level of turbulent intensity .",
    "this kind of convective motion is not dominated by small - scale processes , and integral quantities are well - captured even at moderate resolutions .",
    "the 8.68  km simulation has a short inertial range , but this is more extensive at higher resolutions .",
    "the scaled spectra demonstrate that the dissipation range depends on the computational cell width as expected from an iles - type simulation .",
    "in particular , there is an effective kolmogorov length scale that is a function of the cell width ; the collapse is not exact , but is consistent with previous work , see @xcite , for example , which also contains further discussion of the iles approach and dependence on resolution .",
    "the rms velocity in the convective core ( @xmath135  km ) , @xmath106 , was found by direct measurement to be approximately 14  km  s@xmath0 ( the data ranged from 12  km  s@xmath0 to 18  km  s@xmath0 depending on component and resolution ) ; note that no density weighting was used . even though this estimate is smaller than previously suggested ( @xmath1100500  km  s@xmath0 )",
    ", we argue that it is actually an upper bound for the turbulence produced by convection because it includes large - scale plume - like flow , which artificially inflates the estimate .    to determine the integral length scale in the convective core",
    ", the longitudinal correlation functions were evaluated for the cartesian components of the velocity field , along with the correlation functions of the radial velocity in each cartesian direction , where the ( second - order ) velocity correlation function ( two - point , one - time ) is defined as @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the separation vector .",
    "the integral length scale in the @xmath99 direction , for example , is then defined as the integral of the longitudinal velocity correlation function @xmath138    the correlation functions were evaluated both for the density - weighted and non - weighted velocities ( by replacing @xmath139 by @xmath140 in equation ( [ eq : corrfn ] ) and the appropriate normalization factor in equation ( [ eq : intlen ] ) , and are compared in figure [ fig : correlation ] by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the weighted and non - weighted correlation functions are in close agreement , suggesting that measuring the integral length scale is not affected by the variations in density . by integrating each correlation ( ignoring the negative parts ) , integral length scales for each component",
    "were evaluated and are shown by the vertical lines with the corresponding line style .",
    "the @xmath99 component appears not be consistent with the other components , probably because there is a large plume - like structure roughly aligned with the @xmath99-axis . taking this to be an outlier ,",
    "the mean integral length scale was found to be approximately 169  km ( with a standard deviation of approximately 8.4  km ) .",
    "averages and standard deviations of integral length scale and rms velocity were evaluated using seven time points over 350  s at the 4.34  km resolution , and were found to be approximately 200@xmath14150  km and 16@xmath1413  km  s@xmath0 , respectively .    taking the integral length scale to be 200  km and the turbulent intensity to be 16  km  s@xmath0 ,",
    "the specific energy dissipation rate @xmath142 is approximately @xmath143  @xmath144  s@xmath145 .",
    "the corresponding estimates that were suggested to be necessary for a spontaneous detonation by @xcite were 10  km and 500  km  s@xmath0 , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this gives @xmath146  @xmath144  s@xmath145 , six orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the present simulations suggest that the turbulent intensity required for a spontaneous detonation can not be produced by convection within the core .",
    "overall , our high - resolution simulations agreed with the findings of z11 regarding the ignition radius of 50  km with a likely range of 40  km to 75  km .",
    "we do note that the outer limit of 100  km reported in z11 is probably too large , as we do not see any hot bubbles at that radius that are still increasing in temperature . by looking closely at the dynamics of the last few hot spots ,",
    "we conclude that the multiple ignition scenario is unlikely . with improved resolution",
    ", we now describe the large - scale coherent structure in the convective field as a plume , rather than a jet , and have a better understanding of the turbulent nature of the flow .",
    "these findings , together with those from z11 , indicate that a single - point , off - center ignition is the most likely scenario for sne ia . at the radii we find ignition to be most likely , the initial flame will float away faster than it can burn toward the center ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , making for an asymmetric explosion .",
    "this scenario has been explored in explosion calculations , potentially giving rise to the `` gravitationally confined detonation '' @xcite , although other groups suggest that this mechanism may not be robust  @xcite .",
    "if a single off - center ignition fails to blow up the star , then it is possible that we would need to wait for the next ignition point , perhaps tens of seconds later , or cycle through many widely spaced ignitions until we ignite closer to the center ( i.e.  many successive false starts ) .",
    "alternately , some type of pulsational model may ensue  @xcite . with these results ,",
    "the challenge to the explosion modelers is to demonstrate that the single - degenerate chandrasekhar mass white dwarf model can produce robust explosions resulting from single - point , off - center ignition .",
    "observations may show support for asymmetric models  @xcite , but some radiative transfer calculations seem to preclude extreme amounts of asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the various components of the convecting white dwarf and give characteristic length and velocity scales for each ; figure [ fig : schematic ] presents this information in schematic form .",
    "buoyancy drives a large - scale flow in the convective core , which extends to a radius on the order of 1000  km",
    ". this large - scale flow is composed of plumes around 100  km wide and several hundred km long with a bulk velocity around 100  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "these plumes drive turbulence in the core with an rms velocity and integral length scale that were estimated to be on the order of 16  km  s@xmath0 and 200  km , respectively .",
    "this level of turbulence is far below that required for a spontaneous detonation to occur .",
    "the stably stratified region outside the convective core , extending from @xmath11000  km to @xmath11900  km , is made up of circumferential shear layers , with a smaller radial velocity component .",
    "these shear layers are on the order of 100  km deep , several hundred km long , with typical velocities on the order of 100  km  s@xmath0 and peak velocities that may be in excess of 250  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the burning of a single off - center ignition would be dominated at early times by the laminar flame speed ( on the order of 50  km  s@xmath0 ) , and the level of turbulence in the core is unlikely to deform the flame very much at all .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that large - scale entrainment was the dominant process in the evolution of a burning bubble , and that the flame speed ( turbulent or laminar ) even up to 100  km  s@xmath0 did not significantly affect the evolution .",
    "therefore , the turbulence produced by convection in the core is unlikely to play a significant role in the explosion .",
    "as the bubble reaches the edge of the convective core , it will be @xmath1500  km across moving with a rise speed on the order of 1000  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the turbulence within the bubble itself is likely to have an rms velocity on the order of 100  km  s@xmath0 on an integral length scale of a few tens of km . in the past",
    ", it has been suggested that the convective boundary lies at the density suggested for a deflagration - to - detonation transition  @xcite .",
    "although the velocities in the core are unlikely to affect the bubble as it rises , the circumferential velocities in the stable region are much greater and may interact strongly with the bubble as it passes through this region .",
