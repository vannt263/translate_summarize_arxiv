    "in ref .  @xcite , one of us and coworkers introduced a new classification of quantum nonlocality , a formalisation of the concept of _ steering _ introduced by schrdinger in 1935 @xcite as a generalization of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite .",
    "steering can be understood as the failure of a hybrid _ local hidden variable _ ( lhv)_local hidden state _ ( lhs ) model to reproduce the correlations between two subsystems . here , ` state ' means a quantum state for one subsystem ( traditionally bob s ) , as opposed to the ` variables ' used to describe alice s system which are not constrained to correspond to a quantum state . apart from assuming local causality in the same sense as bell used , an lhv  lhs model assumes that one of the parties ( bob ) performs trusted quantum measurements on his subsystem , whereas the other ( alice ) does not trust her measurement apparatus .",
    "equivalently , it can be thought of as a model where bob is in possession of a system in some unknown quantum state , only classically correlated with some arbitrary variables producing the outcomes at alice s site .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of us and coworkers introduced the concept of _ epr - steering inequalities _ as any criterion which demonstrates that a set of correlations observed by alice and bob can not be described by an lhv  lhs model .",
    "the first example of such inequalities , based upon multiplying conditional variances , was introduced in the seminal paper by reid in 1989  @xcite , to create an experimentally accessible version of the epr - paradox , applicable to continuous variables systems , as in epr s original argument .",
    "an inequality for the case of discrete variables , as discussed in bohm s version of the epr paradox , was introduced by one of us and coworkers in @xcite . that these _ reid inequalities _ , as they are sometimes known , can be derived from the lhv  lhs model , was shown in ref .",
    "epr - steering has been demonstrated over macroscopic distances using both continuous variables  @xcite and discrete variables  @xcite .",
    "there have also been many recent theoretical advances , even for the simple case relevant to two qubits .",
    "this includes showing that violation of an epr - steering inequality is a necessary condition for one - sided device - independent quantum key distribution  @xcite , determining the most parsimonious demonstration  @xcite , showing that one - way epr - steerability exists for two - qubit states  @xcite , and relating epr - steerability to the so - called steering ellipsoid  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a new theoretical result : an epr - steering inequality that is necessary and sufficient for a set of correlations involving two settings and two outcomes per site , with mutually unbiased measurements at bob s site . by applying this inequality",
    ", we then put to test , for the first time , whether chsh - type  @xcite correlations observed in a recent experiment  @xcite exhibit epr - steering .",
    "the interesting thing about this experiment was that the entanglement was provided by a single - photon split between two parties .",
    "we stress that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , although using chsh - type correlations , are clear that they do not demonstrate bell - nonlocality , because of the nonidealities of their measurements ; what they do demonstrate is entanglement , with minimal assumptions about the state . nevertheless their detection efficiencies were quite high , so it certainly seems possible that their experiment could have been a demonstration of epr - steering .",
    "they do not consider this question in their paper , and it is only with the theory presented here that it is clear how to answer the question definitively .",
    "we conclude with open questions .",
    "let us introduce our notation . given a pair of systems at alice and bob , denote @xmath0 and @xmath1 the sets of observables in the hilbert space of alice s and bob s system , respectively .",
    "an element of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath2 , with a set of outcomes labeled by @xmath3 , and similarly for bob .",
    "the joint state @xmath4 of the system is steerable by alice iff it is _ not _ the case that for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the joint probability distributions can be written in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes an arbitrary probability distribution and @xmath11 denotes the quantum probability of outcome @xmath12 given measurement @xmath13 on state * @xmath14*.    this can be understood as follows : if the state is not steerable , then the correlations between alice and bob could be generated by a distribution of local variables @xmath15 , each of which determines arbitrarily the probabilities for outcomes at alice s side and a quantum state on bob s side . for this reason wiseman",
    "_ called the model of ( [ eq : no - steering ] ) a local hidden state ( lhs ) model @xcite , though here we adopt the more transparent term , an lhv  lhs model , as explained in the introduction .",
    "the question we will address is : if alice and bob each have a choice of two dichotomic observables , how can we prove that their experimental outcomes can not be explained by that model ?",
    "we thus consider a scenario where alice and bob perform subsets @xmath16 and @xmath17 of all observables , called _",
    "measurement strategies_. the correlations @xmath18 for a measurement strategy @xmath19 and @xmath20 exhibit steering if and only if it is not the case that there exists a model of type ( [ eq : no - steering ] ) for all @xmath5 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , if for a given measurement strategy the correlations have an lhv  lhs model , this does not imply that the underlying _ state @xmath4 _ is not steerable , since there could be another strategy that does not .",
    "however , we can still ask the question of whether there are necessary and sufficient conditions for a particular measurement strategy to demonstrate steering .    in @xcite , it was shown that steering is a form of nonlocality strictly weaker than bell nonlocality .",
    "that is , a state has no lhv",
    " lhs model if ( but not only if ) it has no lhv model ( i.e.  an lhv model for both parties ) .",
    "the correlations between alice and bob are said to have an lhv model when for all @xmath5 , @xmath21 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the joint probability distributions can be written in the form @xmath24 in that case , given a finite number of settings per site and a finite number of outcomes per setting , it is well - known that the set of correlations allowed by lhv theories live in a convex polytope  a convex set the extreme points of which are the classical `` pure '' states , i.e. , the states with well - defined values for all observables .",
    "the bell inequalities are the linear inequalities that define the facets of this polytope , and therefore they completely characterise the set .",
    "given the set of experimental probabilities @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , this has an lhv model if and only if it satisfies all bell inequalities for that number of settings and outcomes .",
    "in the simplest bell scenario , involving two observers with 2 dichotomic measurements per site , the chsh inequality @xcite and its permutations define all the non - trivial facets of the lhv polytope . here",
    "we ask whether a similar inequality can be derived for the same scenario .",
    "this is the the simplest steering scenario involving projective measurements , although a simpler demonstration is possible if bob uses a single trichotomic positive - operator - valued measure  @xcite , in the sense defined in that reference .",
    "the set of correlations that have an lhv  lhs model for a given scenario also form a convex set  @xcite , and we will now proceed to study that set .",
    "in particular , we can rewrite any lhv  lhs model in terms of a model that involves a distribution only over the extreme points of that convex set .",
    "that is , we can simplify equation ( [ eq : no - steering ] ) by noting that we can always decompose @xmath27 into @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are variables which determine all values of the observables @xmath2 via the function @xmath30 , and @xmath31 determines a pure state @xmath32 for bob .",
    "thus if @xmath33 is the projection operator corresponding to outcome @xmath12 of measurement @xmath13 , equation ( [ eq : no - steering ] ) becomes ( where we omit reference to @xmath4 since we make no assumption about the state that produces the correlations ) @xmath34",
    "we will now focus on the case where alice and bob each have a choice between two dichotomic measurements to perform : \\{@xmath2 , @xmath35 } , \\{@xmath13,@xmath36}. the outcomes of @xmath2 will be labelled @xmath37 and similarly for the other measurements .    the extremal values for alice and bob",
    "can each be written in a vector form .",
    "for alice we define the vector @xmath38 where @xmath39 , etc .",
    "obviously there are only four distinct such extremal vectors . for bob",
    "we define a probability vector @xmath40 similarly , but as a function of the hidden variable @xmath31 , and where @xmath41 of course there is a continuous infinity of such vectors for bob .",
    "we call @xmath42 an extremal matrix .",
    "it generates the _ correlation matrix _ @xmath43 , which encodes the joint probabilities for all combinations of measurements via @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 elements of this matrix are all the distinct @xmath18 , which comprise all the data that alice and bob extract from their measurements .",
    "our problem can now be rephrased as whether one can , given the experimental @xmath43 , decide whether it can be written as ( [ eq : p ] ) .    as an example , here is the extremal matrix for @xmath47 and an arbitrary state @xmath32 : @xmath48.\\ ] ] the matrices for the other three extremal vectors at alice s side are similar to this , but with some columns permuted . since bob",
    "s probabilities arise from measurements on a quantum system , there are constraints that they must obey , such as uncertainty relations .",
    "we will now study those constraints .",
    "let the basis of eigenstates for bob s observable @xmath13 be labelled as @xmath49 .",
    "the projector for outcome @xmath50 of @xmath36 can be parametrized by @xmath51 and @xmath52 as follows @xmath53 similarly , we can write an arbitrary pure state as @xmath54 then @xmath55    analysing the equations above , we find that the set of allowed quantum probabilities , i.e. the possible pairs of @xmath56 , form the convex hull of an ellipse with eccentricity characterised by the parameter @xmath57 , which depends only on the measurements being performed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : convex_sets ] .",
    "the boundaries are achieved with @xmath58 .",
    "this completely characterises the set of allowed @xmath40 .",
    "since we are interested in the extreme points of this set , we can reparametrize the ellipse using the real parameter @xmath31 to stand for any quantum state that can generate that point for a given value of @xmath51 : @xmath59   \\nonumber \\\\ p_{1}^{b'}(\\xi)-\\frac{1}{2 } & = & \\frac{1}{2}[\\sqrt{\\mu}\\,\\cos(\\xi)+\\sqrt{1-\\mu}\\,\\sin(\\xi)],\\label{eq : parametrisation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduces to a circle for @xmath60 and to diagonal or off - diagonal lines for @xmath61 .",
    "if one does not include the information about which observables are being measured , then the extreme points become the vertices of the square and we obtain for @xmath43 the whole set of bell - local correlations , the ( non - trivial ) boundaries of which are given by the chsh inequalities .     for outcomes associated with two projective measurements @xmath62 , @xmath63 on a qubit",
    "are ellipses defined by the parameter @xmath57 . here",
    "they are shown for @xmath64 ( red ) , @xmath65 ( blue ) , @xmath66 ( green ) .",
    "[ fig : convex_sets ] ]    looking at an arbitrary @xmath43 representing statistical data from alice s and bob s measurements , we find that it has to satisfy certain constraints .",
    "four of these are normalisation conditions of the form @xmath67 .",
    "another 8 constraints come from non - signalling conditions of the form @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the number of free parameters in @xmath43 is reduced from 16 to 4 .",
    "it is sufficient then to consider the space of 4 parameters given by the correlations of the form @xmath69 these correlations will have an lhv  lhs model if and only if they can be written in the form @xmath70 given the 4 correlations of form @xmath71 ( and the constraints above ) , @xmath43 is uniquely determined , and vice - versa .",
    "therefore , if there is an lhv  lhs model of the form ( [ eq : p ] ) for @xmath43 then there is an lhv  lhs model for this set of correlations , and vice - versa .",
    "let us look at the case @xmath60 , which corresponds to spin measurements along orthogonal spatial directions on bob s system .",
    "then the boundary is a circle and ( [ eq : parametrisation ] ) can be reparametrized as ( we will keep the label @xmath31 for notational simplicity but note that it is different from that of eq .",
    "[ eq : ellipse ] ) @xmath72 now we will label @xmath73 , corresponding respectively to @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we can thus see that for each value of @xmath78 the four correlation functions can be written as @xmath79    the two last columns can be obtained from the first two by making @xmath80 , so the only relevant extreme points are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "all points in the convex set of lhv  lhs correlations can be written as a convex combination of the first two columns for each value of @xmath31 .",
    "what are the boundaries of that set ?",
    "we start with some partial answers to that question .",
    "four inequalities can be immediately derived that must be satisfied by all points in the set of lhv - lhs correlations : @xmath83    we can also see that the lhv  lhs correlations must satisfy an inequality with the same form of the chsh inequality .",
    "clearly for each column of ( [ eq : extreme points ] ) @xmath84 is satisfied , and therefore it must be also satisfied for the total correlations .",
    "inequality is , of course , satisfied by all lhv correlations .",
    "however , all inequalities in can attain the maximum algebraic value of 2 with lhv models ( where we do not trust bob s apparatuses and thus not require that the measurements performed by bob correspond to the previously defined operators ) .",
    "in fact , there are no non - trivial bounds on lhv correlations with only two correlations , because in an lhv model the values of the variables in one correlation can be set independently of those in the other .",
    "looking for quantum violations , we find that the last two inequalities in eq .   can not be violated , since they have the same choice of setting for alice , and thus essentially reduce to a quantum uncertainty relation for bob s measurements .",
    "the first two can attain the maximal algebraic value of 2 with a maximally entangled state and @xmath2 and @xmath35 along the same direction as the corresponding operator for bob within each correlation function .",
    "the chsh inequality , as is well - known , can attain a maximum value of @xmath85 with quantum correlations .",
    "as explained before , the set of lhv  lhs correlations for the scenario we are considering is defined by all convex combinations of vectors which can be written in the form of the first or second columns of .",
    "we define the sets @xmath86 and @xmath87 by the convex hull of two sets of points in @xmath88 parametrised by @xmath31 : @xmath89\\right\\ } \\right)\\nonumber \\\\ \\mathcal{c}_{2 } & : = \\mathrm{convex}\\left(\\left\\ { ( \\cos\\xi,-\\cos\\xi,\\sin\\xi,-\\sin\\xi)\\colon\\xi\\in[0,2\\pi]\\right\\ } \\right).\\label{eq : sets_c1_c2_definitions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the convex set @xmath90 of lhv  lhs correlations is then the convex hull of the union of @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath91    the first step is to notice that @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in fact filled - in circles in orthogonal subspaces of @xmath88 .",
    "define a new orthogonal basis by the vectors @xmath92 in terms of this basis , the vectors which make up the boundary of @xmath86 are of the form @xmath93 , while the vectors making up the boundary of @xmath87 are @xmath94 . from now on , we write all vectors in terms of the basis @xmath95 .",
    "as we will show , the following inequality describes the volume inside @xmath90 .",
    "writing @xmath96 in the basis @xmath95 , we have @xmath97 if and only if @xmath98 this implies , once converted back into the original basis : @xmath99    this is our main result",
    ". note that since all of the terms such as @xmath100 are positive semi - definite , the left hand side of is always larger than or equal to the left hand side of the chsh inequality ( or any of its permutations ) .",
    "therefore the chsh inequality is violated only if is , i.e. , the correlations violate local causality only if they demonstrate steering . and",
    "contrary to the inequalities in , uses all four correlations @xmath101 .",
    "violation of this inequality is necessary and sufficient for demonstrating epr - steering within this scenario .",
    "proving that all points in @xmath90 satisfy is relatively easy ; we do that first , followed by a proof that all points that satisfy are in @xmath90 .",
    "these proofs can be found in appendices [ appendix_a ] and [ appendix_b ] respectively .",
    "if alice and bob share a maximally",
    "entangled state and alice performs projective measurements , the maximum violation of this inequality happens when alice s measurements are mutually unbiased , when the expression on the left side of becomes @xmath85 .",
    "interestingly , this value is independent of the relative angle between alice s measurement and bob s measurements , unlike the chsh inequality , which requires a specific relation between those measurements , and unlike most known epr - steering inequalities , with the exception of those in ref .",
    "the proof of these statements can be found in appendix [ appendix_c ] .",
    "in this section we apply the above conditions to an experiment involving a single photon split between two parties , designed to `` witness trustworthy single - photon entanglement ''  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_schematic ] ) . in this experiment , because there is ( to a good approximation ) at most one photon , initially in a single mode , the entangled state is a two - qubit state .",
    "moreover , the two parties measure a chsh - type correlation , each using two measurements with binary outcomes .",
    "although bob s measurements are not actually projective , all of the correlations of his results with alice s results are , as we will show , reduced below the correlations that would pertain to projective measurements by a simple multiplicative constant .",
    "thus , with an adjustment for this multiplicative constant , we can apply our theory above to the measured correlations to discover whether this experiment amounts to a demonstration of epr - steering or not .    .",
    "both perform sign - binned homodyne measurements for the @xmath102 and @xmath103 quadratures respectively .",
    "the chsh - type correlation is tested for the measurement outcomes .",
    "in contrast to this scheme which uses only 2 difference bases , in ref .",
    "@xcite , alice uses 6 difference bases , and bob performs quantum tomography for his local quantum state to verify epr - steering . ]      a single - photon state , split between alice and bob , can be represented in the fock basis as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 parameterizes the splitting between the two parties .",
    "restricted to the single - photon subspace , this is a two - qubit state as considered in the above theory .",
    "this is clearly an idealization .",
    "however the dominant deviation from the pure two - qubit state above in ref .",
    "@xcite is due to loss of the photon , or failure to generate it in the first place . that is",
    ", the state can more accurately be described as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the probability that one photon is present .",
    "this mixed state is still a two - qubit state , so we can still apply our theory .    turning now to the measurements performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , they are sign - binned homodyne measurements . for a mode containing at most one photon ,",
    "the positive - operator - valued measure for homodyne measurement of phase @xmath52 is  @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 binning over the sign of the result gives @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the identity operator in the qubit subspace . thus the measurement is not projective in the qubit subspace even for 100% efficient homodyne detection .",
    "including inefficiency is equivalent to adding extra gaussian noise to the measurement  @xcite , which is equivalent to replacing @xmath112 by @xmath113 .",
    "this changes eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) to @xmath114    for alice , it is irrelevant that the the sign - binned homodyne measurement is not projective ; all that matters for the applicability of our theory is that she has a binary ( @xmath115-valued ) measurement on a qubit . for bob ,",
    "it does matter that he is not performing a projective measurement .",
    "however , the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) elements ( [ ineff ] ) are simply a mixture of the identity with the appropriate projectors , @xmath116 thus any linear correlation between alice s result @xmath2 and bob s result @xmath13 is exactly the same as if bob s povm elements were these projectors , except that the correlations will be reduced by the multiplicative factor @xmath117 thus , since bob and his measurements are trusted in epr - steering , we can apply our theory for projective measurements if we correct the measured correlations by dividing by @xmath118 .",
    "now we calculate the epr - steering inequality for ref .  @xcite using the given experimental parameters [ based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq_nec_suf ] ) ] .",
    "the only difference is that the left hand side of the epr - steering inequality , which is linear in the correlation strength of alice s and bob s results , is reduced by the multiplicative factor of @xmath118 [ eq .",
    "( [ scaling_for_exp_imperfection ] ) ] .",
    "thus we can use ( [ eq : ineq_nec_suf ] ) if we simply multiply the right hand side by the same factor @xmath118 , giving @xmath119 here the observables denote sign - binned homodyne measurements for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the @xmath123 and @xmath124 quadratures respectively .",
    "first we calculate the right hand side . the homodyne efficiency in ref .",
    "@xcite was @xmath125 .",
    "thus the right hand side evaluates to @xmath126    next we calculate the left hand side . as ref .",
    "@xcite does not give individual correlation values , we assume that all correlations have the same magnitude : @xmath127 , as expected from the experimental set - up , and as is usual for a chsh - type correlation . with this assumption , the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cavalcanti_steering_correction ] ) reduces to @xmath128 whereas the @xmath129 value used to calculate the chsh inequality in ref .",
    "@xcite reduces to @xmath130 since the largest @xmath129 value in ref .",
    "@xcite was @xmath131 for a maximally entangled state [ @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model_arbitrary_qubit ] ) ] , it follows that the epr - steering inequality eq .",
    "( [ cavalcanti_steering_correction ] ) is bounded by @xmath133 this proves that the experimentally measured correlations could not have violated an epr - steering inequality .",
    "we have derived an epr - steering inequality and shown that its violation is necessary and sufficient to demonstrate epr - steering in the simple scenario of 2 parties with 2 dichotomic measurements per party and mutually unbiased qubit observables for bob .",
    "this inequality uses 4 correlations between the observables , as in the chsh inequality , and we have shown that , as expected , the latter is violated only if our inequality is .",
    "we have then applied this inequality to a recent experiment involving a single photon split between two parties , and shown that this experiment could not have demonstrated epr - steering , unlike a similar experiment by two of us and coworkers  @xcite , which did .",
    "questions for further research include : is there a state which does not violate the inequality with mutually unbiased settings for bob ( @xmath60 ) but violates an epr - steering inequality for other values of @xmath51 ? or else , can we prove that violation of the inequality introduced here is necessary and sufficient to demonstrate steering under the scenario considered here ? can this procedure be adapted for more settings ? and similar to the question above ,",
    "are mutually unbiased settings optimal ?",
    "could it be sufficient ( for two qubits ) to consider a finite number of settings , i.e. , is a 2-qubit state steerable if and only if it violates the necessary and sufficient inequality for , say , 3 settings ? otherwise , can we find a class of states that gives a counterexample ?",
