    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    a beautiful fact about the moduli space is its tiling by the convex polytope known as the associahedron @xmath17 .",

    "we redraw our pictures of dissected polygons so that every region of the dissection becomes a regular polygon _ without _ diagonals . in the nomenclature of @xcite , we denote the resulting object as a _ cluster _ , where each regular polygon of the cluster is called a _",

    "clearly dissected polygons and clusters are equinumerous , and it is sometimes easier to work with clusters rather than with dissections , as the following important property of the associahedron demonstrates .",

    "recall that the number of diagonals of a polygon is equal to the codim of its face ; polygons ( a ) and ( b ) are of dim two , and ( c ) through ( e ) are of dim zero .",
    "in particular , polygons ( c ) through ( e ) are of the same type ( points ) whereas ( a ) and ( b ) are not ; the polytope ( a ) is a square and ( b ) a pentagon .",
    "only ( d ) and ( e ) are of the same class ; that is , twisting along a diagonal of ( d ) will result in ( e ) .",
    "[ h ]    it makes sense to decompose the faces into dimensions and polytopes , but what does it mean to talk about classes ? the two different classes of points discussed above correspond to the following : at one class ( c ) , three pentagons meet ; there are two such points in @xmath24 .",

    "the computer algorithm for doing this was nothing out of the ordinary , but a few comments on how the drawings were produced may be of some interest .",
    "we exploited the connection between dissected polygons and trees as illustrated in figure  [ f : pct ] .",

    "classes correspond to planar imbeddings of trees up to twisting .",
    "in other words , for a given class , each vertex of the tree is given the addition information of preserving the cyclic order of edges around that vertex .",
    "the problem was therefore to produce one such tree for each class .    since the trees needed were quite small ,",
    "it was not worth devising a clever algorithm ; both elegance and efficiency were sacrificed for ease of programming .",
    "rooted trees , the root being a vertex of the tree , were generated step by step according to height .",
    "there is one tree of height zero , and those of height one are the stars with three or more edges at the root .",
    "those of height two were obtained by grafting a subtree of height at most one , by its root , to the terminal vertices of these stars . in general ,",
    "trees of height @xmath19 were obtained by grafting trees of height at most @xmath119 . at each stage , if two trees were reflections of each other , only one was retained , thus taking care of the twist operation .",
    "this corresponds to producing clusters rooted at an edge , which made possible a check that the right numbers of trees were being produced .",
    "the resulting lists of rooted trees would usually contain several copies of the same unrooted tree .",
    "the unwanted duplicates were weeded out by computing for each tree a _ code _ similar to that described in @xcite and eliminating all but one of those with the same code .",
    "the actual program contained some refinements to the procedure just described but we shall skip the details .",

    "had we thought of this earlier , it could have been done more easily along with the generation of the classes , but as it was , we derived these numbers directly from the data on the dissected polygons . for each such polygon , we produced the fixed polygons obtainable from it by rotations or by combinations of the twist operation .",
    "note that twisting about some chords leaves the diagram unchanged , in which case there is no point in performing the twist .",
    "for example , those chords which have a single polygon on one side fall into this category , and are easily recognised .",
    "for ease of programming , only the chords of this kind were exempted from the twist operation ; no attempt was made to recognize any others . as a result , duplicates could , and were , produced . however , for polygons with at most ten sides there can be at most five such chords , so the number of duplicates was small .",
    "they were eliminated by a suitable coding procedure , similar to that mentioned above for trees .",

    "similar to @xmath0 , this double cover also has an underlying structure of labeled trees @xcite with two exceptions .",
    "first , the trees are no longer free but rooted at the label @xmath134 .",
    "second , twisting is allowed except along the edge containing the root .",
    "the reason for these moduli spaces to be characterized by trees without degree two vertices is due to the stability condition coming from geometric invariant theory @xcite .",
    "git gives a natural compactification of the space of genus zero algebraic curves which are _ stable _ in the sense of having only finitely many automorphisms ; that is , the curves can not have just two distinguished points .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    there is a natural action of the symmetric group @xmath135 on @xmath0 which permutes the labelings of the @xmath3-gon .",
    "this action is certainly not free ; therefore , for a given face @xmath44 in @xmath0 , its isotropy group @xmath136 need not be trivial , where @xmath137 given two distinct faces of @xmath0 which are of the same class , their isotropy groups are _ isomorphic _ ; in fact , they are conjugate subgroups in @xmath135 .",
    "we wish to determine , up to isomorphism , the isotropy group of a given class ; we interchangably write @xmath138 to denote the isotropy group of @xmath44 and its isomorphism class .",
    "let @xmath44 be the face of @xmath139 given in figure  [ isotropy]a ; its class is @xmath140 .",

    "this can be obtained using another approach : choose a dissected polygon representing the class @xmath117 . under all possible labelings ,",
    "there are @xmath29 such polygons , many of which are identified in @xmath0 .",

    "eccentricity _ of a vertex is the maximum of its distances to all other vertices .",
    "the _ center _ of @xmath33 is the subgraph induced by the vertices of minimum eccentricity .",
    "it is a classic result of graph theory that the center of a tree is either one vertex or one edge . taking the dual ,",
    "the center of the dissected polygon is either a cell or a diagonal .    _",
    "non - central cells : _ for each non - central cell of the polygon , observe if there exists an automorphism of the cell obtained by twisting along diagonals .",

    "figure  [ localcell]b shows the class @xmath150 as a cluster , with the central cell shaded . out of the four non - central cells , three of them have a @xmath149 action ( figure  [ localcell]c ) , contributing @xmath142 to the isotropy group",
    ".    _ central diagonal : _ if the center is a diagonal , there are two possibilites : observe whether or not there exists a ( global ) reflection along the central diagonal .",

    "the cell could also have just a reflection action ( class @xmath154 ) , as in figure  [ centercell]b .",
    "finally , for an @xmath3-gon , there could be a dihedral action @xmath100 on the central cell , where @xmath19 divides @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ centercell]c shows class @xmath155 with the @xmath156 group action . rotation symmetry ,",
    "reflection is also possible due to twisting . ]    since there are no intersecting diagonals , the different twists and reflections , along with any dihedral group action , all commute .",
    "therefore , to find the isotropy group , we look at the contribution of each local and global action and simply take their direct product .",
    "for example , the isotropy groups ( up to isomorphism ) for the polygons of figure  [ centercell ] are @xmath157 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "using proposition  [ p : new ] , we calculate @xmath144 for each of the classes to be @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , respectively , matching the values obtained from proposition  [ p : cp3 ] .",
    "each class corresponds to a polytope . by definition ,",
    "each element of the isotropy group maps the polytope to itself ; but what type of map is it ? using figure  [ isotropy]a as an example of a face @xmath44 , we show how the generators of @xmath138 act on the polytope .",
    "note that the polytope structure of @xmath44 is a cube , the product of three line segments , as labeled in figure  [ isocube ] .",
    "the actions of the three generators of @xmath138 given in example  [ e : isotropy ] are the reflections along the shaded planes .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    we first point out a few interesting similarities to classical combinatorics @xcite . as noted above , partitioning of an @xmath3-gon using @xmath19 diagonals corresponds to using @xmath19 sets of brackets meaningfully on @xmath70 _ non - commutative _ variables ( see figure  [ k4 ] ) .",
    "the _ generalized bracketing problem of schrder _ is to find the number @xmath162 of different bracketings of @xmath3 variables using an arbitrary number of brackets ( where each bracket must contain at least two elements ) .",
    "lemma  [ l : cayley ] gives us the number of different bracketing for a fixed set of @xmath19 brackets .",
    "summing up , we find @xmath163    the _ wedderburn - etherington commutative bracketing problem _ is to find the number @xmath164 of ways of using @xmath18 sets of brackets meaningfully on @xmath3 _ commutative _ variables .",
    "in other words , it is the number of different _ bracketings _ that arise from commuting binary subproducts .",
    "it is not too hard to see that @xmath164 gives the number of @xmath20-gons with maximal diagonals rooted at an outside edge , identified up to reflection along the root edge and twisting along diagonals , but _ not _ rotation .",
    "it follows that @xmath165 ( see table  [ a - mn ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : wedder ] shows @xmath166 and @xmath167 as polygon and bracketing representations .",
    "the coefficients of the generating function of equation  [ e : gena ] generalize the wedderburn - etherington numbers : the possible ways of using @xmath19 brackets on @xmath3 commutative variables is @xmath168 .",
    "we mention two occurrences outside mathematics that encode information using labeled trees .",
    "the first is in biology ; in particular , the areas of genetics and evolution @xcite .",
    "the theory of evolution conjectures that there exist links between certain species to common ancestors using the evidence from protein sequences .",
    "an evolutionary tree , or _",
    "phylogeny _ , is a means of organizing this data : the external ( labeled ) vertices represent species for which data is available whereas the internal ( unlabeled ) vertices are the hypothetical ancestors for which no direct evidence is known .",
    "phylogenies usually have no vertices of degree two .",
    "the following emumerates the number of phylogenies having a fixed set of leaves .",
    "\\2 . a _ rooted _ phylogeny is a rooted labeled tree where the root does not receive a label .",
    "the root of a phylogeny represents the ancestor of all organisms of the tree . for @xmath3",
    "labeled external vertices , the number @xmath172 of distinct rooted phylogenies is @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "there exist many possible metrics on phylogenetic trees @xcite .",
    "it was also noted in @xcite that one can give lengths to the edges of labeled trees , making them _ weighted _ , which hold data on the time estimate of evolution taking place between two species of the tree .",
    "recently , a space of phylogenetic trees was constructed , closely related to the ` dual ' of @xmath0 @xcite ; the metric on this tree space inherits some properties from the natural metric on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "another appearance of labeled trees is in physics ; in particular , the quantum theory of angular momentum . given a system of @xmath3 independent parts , each with its own angular momentum ,",
    "the theory deals with constructing the total angular momentum by coupling the given @xmath3 momenta sequentially in pairs using @xmath174 wigner coefficients .",
    "biedenharn and louck further relate this to the racah - wigner algebra and the 6-@xmath175 symbols @xcite .",
    "enumerating the various _ binary coupling schemes _ gives a total of @xmath48 possibilities , thought of as counting maximal bracketings on @xmath3 variables ( zero dim cells of @xmath17 ) .",
    "permuting two angular momenta implies a phase change in their _",
    "state vectors_. considering binary coupling schemes over all such permutations yield @xmath176 possibilites ( zero dim cells in @xmath29 copies of @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , in quantum physics it is not possible to distinguish state vectors differing by phase factors ; schemes are identified by commuting binary subproducts .",
    "this yields @xmath177 possible coupling schemes ( zero dim cells in @xmath178 ) .",
    "as noted , the idea of binary coupling closely follows the gluing of associahedra to form the moduli space , at least in the zero dimensional case . although combinatorially the idea of coupling momenta can be generalized beyond binary pairs ( by possibly counting the codim @xmath19 cells of moduli spaces )",
    ", the meaning of this in the context of theoretical physics is not yet well understood .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge their indebtedness to , and admiration for , the work of professor arthur cayley , who not only addressed a dissection problem similar to the one in this paper , but also laid the foundations for the enumerative study of tree - like structures in general .",
    "this pioneering work is all the more remarkable in that it was only a small part of the mathematical output of this eminent victorian ."
