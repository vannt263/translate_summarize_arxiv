    "the d3-d5 brane system is one of the best studied examples of top - down holography using probe branes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a stack of @xmath1 coincident and appropriately oriented d5 branes is placed in the vicinity of a stack of @xmath2 coincident d3 branes . in the limit where the number of d3 branes n is taken large and the string coupling @xmath3 small so that @xmath4 is held constant , the d3 branes are replaced by the @xmath5 background spacetime and the d5-branes are a probe embedded in this background .",
    "the probe limit requires that @xmath6 . the string theory is weakly coupled in the limit where @xmath7 is large . in this limit",
    ", the mathematical problem of understanding the probe branes reduces to understanding the embedding of their worldvolume in @xmath5 .",
    "the field theory dual of the large @xmath2 limit of string theory on @xmath5 is the planar limit of @xmath8 supersymmetric yang mills theory with t hooft coupling @xmath7 .",
    "the role of the probe branes is to introduce fundamental representation degrees of freedom . in the d3-d5 system , these degrees of freedom constitute a supersymmetric hypermultiplet which occupies a 2 + 1-dimensional defect embedded in 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this system has a solution with superconformal symmetry which preserves half of the supersymmetries of the @xmath8 theory and the conformal symmetry of the defect .",
    "the probe brane worldvolume is the space @xmath9 which has bosonic symmetries @xmath10 .",
    "when there are @xmath1 coincident d5 branes , there is a @xmath11 flavor symmetry in the field theory dual .",
    "when temperature , an external magnetic field and charge density are introduced , the d3-d5 system has a rich phase diagram @xcite .",
    "for example , at zero temperature and density , the presence of a constant external magnetic field results in spontaneous breaking of an so(3 ) chiral symmetry of the dual field theory .",
    "this is an example of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking , where the tendency of interactions to break chiral symmetry is greatly enhanced in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "due to chiral symmetry breaking , the field theory spectrum gets a charge gap . in the holographic theory , this is seen as the probe brane taking up a \" minkowski embedding  , where it still approaches @xmath12 near the boundary of @xmath13 , but it is modified in the bulk and it caps off before it reaches the poincare horizon .",
    "the charge gap is seen in the fact that the d3-d5 strings , whose low energy modes are the u(1 ) charged fundamental representation matter degrees of freedom , must be suspended between the d5 worldvolume and the poincare horizon . when the worldvolume does not reach the horizon ,",
    "the d3-d5 strings must have a minimum length and therefore they have an energy gap .    when a charge density is introduced in addition to the magnetic field",
    ", there is a low density phase which still exhibits dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . in all cases , when the charge density is nonzero , the d5 brane embedding must be a `` black hole embedding '' , rather than minkowski embedding .",
    "black hole horizon as well as intersecting the boundary of @xmath13 , here we shall use this term , even though we shall deal solely with the zero temperature limit where there is no black hole .",
    "we use it to refer to probe brane whose worldvolume reaches the poincare horizon of the poincare coordinate patch of @xmath13 . ]",
    "it must stretch from the boundary of @xmath13 to the poincare horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that it carries worldvolume electric flux .",
    "it is not possible for the worldvolume to pinch off smoothly unless there is a sink to absorb the electric flux .",
    "fundamental strings suspended between the worldvolume and the horizon could provide such a sink .",
    "however , fundamental strings with the necessary configuration always have a larger tension than the d5-brane , and they would pull the d5 brane to the horizon . indeed , the numerical solutions for the worldvolume geometry do exhibit a spike which resembles such a fundamental string funnel . a black hole embedding is thus a compressible state",
    "it does not have a charge gap .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling that the d5 brane states do not have a charge gap and are compressible for any non - zero value of the charge density . in this paper",
    ", we examine the question whether the u(1 ) charged d5 brane can have an incompressible state at all .",
    "we shall find that , for an interesting range of u(1 ) charge , the answer is yes and we will construct the corresponding solutions .    in rough outline ,",
    "our solution of this problem is as follows .",
    "we consider @xmath1 d5 branes which enter @xmath13 at its boundary . at the boundary",
    "the d5 brane worldvolume wraps a 2-sphere @xmath14 embedded in @xmath15 and has an asymptotically @xmath12 component embedded in @xmath13 .",
    "it also has worldvolume gauge fields which are needed so that the dual field theory has a constant external magnetic field and a constant @xmath16 charge density . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider only the case where the temperature is zero , although we anticipate that most of our results could easily be generalized to finite temperature .",
    "as the ads radius decreases , the d5 branes blow up via the myers effect @xcite to a d7 brane whose worldvolume wraps a second two 2-sphere @xmath17 in @xmath15 .",
    "the second 2-sphere carries a dirac monopole bundle of the d7 worldvolume gauge field with @xmath1 units of monopole charge .",
    "the same coupling of the d7 brane to the ramond - ramond 4-form fields which implements the myers effect also generates a topological term @xmath18 in the d7 brane worldvolume gauge theory .",
    "this term allows the magnetic flux to carry electric charge . in this way",
    ", the electric charge dissolves into the d7 brane . for a certain value of the charge density ,",
    "all of the charge can be dissolved and the d7 brane is allowed to cap off at a finite ads radius , that is , to have a minkowski embedding .",
    "the result is an incompressible state with a charge gap .",
    "the filling fraction ( the dimensionless ratio of charge density to magnetic field ) at which this occurs is precisely that of a @xmath19 integer quantum hall state . if the filling fraction @xmath0 is close to , but not equal to one , the d7 brane still exists , but it has a different character as it has residual charge and it must therefore have a black hole embedding which reaches the poincare horizon .",
    "we are able to confirm this by numerical solution of the embedding equations for the d7 brane where we find the minkowski embedding at @xmath19 and black hole embeddings for the d5 brane with any nonzero charge density and the d7 brane when @xmath20 .",
    "we also find that these d7 brane solutions have lower energy than d5 brane solutions with the same parameters , and are therefore favored , at least in an interesting parameter region including @xmath19 and perhaps a much larger region which is yet to be explored .",
    "our analysis is most reliable when @xmath21 which is large .",
    "of course , our holographic computations are reliable when @xmath22 is large .",
    "then , we also find higher integer quantized hall systems by considering , for @xmath23 , for example , @xmath1 d5 branes where a subset of them , say @xmath24 d5 branes , blow up into one d7 brane and the remaining @xmath25 d5 branes blow up into a second d7 brane and where both of the latter branes are in the @xmath19 charge - gapped incompressible state . for @xmath23 , we show that this state is preferred over both the un - gapped @xmath23 d7 brane solution and the d5 brane with the same parameters .",
    "we also find that the symmetric solution where @xmath26 seems to be preferred .",
    "this state has a residual @xmath27 symmetry , and to have this symmetry in the strictest sense , @xmath1 must be an even number .",
    "we speculate that there can be a large number of stable integer quantum hall states up to the maximum filling fraction which can be achieved in this way , @xmath28 although many are outside of the domain where our analysis using probe branes is reliable . in order for a higher integer filling fraction to be @xmath29 symmetric",
    ", @xmath0 must be a divisor of @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis of the incompressible state will be entirely from the d7-brane point of view .",
    "there should be an alternative approach , which we have not explored yet , where the object is a non - abelian configuration of d5-branes , similar to the bion which occurs on flat space @xcite@xcite .",
    "the transverse coordinates of the d5-brane become non - commutative and form a fuzzy sphere .",
    "this fuzzy sphere is the d5-picture of the additional sphere which is wrapped by the d7 brane worldvolume in our analysis .",
    "the u(1 ) flux on this sphere records the number of d5-branes . from the d7 brane point of view , the bion spike is just the portion of the d7 brane which reaches the boundary of @xmath13 where the 2-sphere collapses and it resembles a d5 brane .",
    "the source for this spike in the d5 worldvolume is @xmath1 units of d5 brane charge which are attached to the d7-brane at its asymptotic boundary .",
    "one would expect that , like the case of the bion , the d5 brane analysis is more accurate in the core of the object , that is near the spike , and the d7 analysis should be good away from the spike , in the interior of @xmath13",
    ". it would be interesting if this could be exploited to better understand some dynamical issues such as how the difference of energies of the d5 and d7 occurs from that point of view .",
    "the landau level spectrum of an so(3 ) doublet of massless non - interacting fermions in a magnetic field is depicted .",
    "the energy levels are the horizontal lines and the vertical axis is the single - particle energy .",
    "only fermionic levels are shown here .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath30 and",
    "we have suppresed the color degeneracy .",
    "the two columns represent the two isospin states .",
    "fermions are depicted by the dots . in the neutral ground state ,",
    "negative energy levels are filled and positive energy levels are empty .",
    "the zero energy states must be half - filled . in the absence of interactions , all possible fillings of the zero energy states",
    "have the same energy .",
    "this gives rise to a large degeneracy of the many - body ground state . ]",
    "it is interesting to examine what one would expect in the weak coupling limit .",
    "our purpose here is to understand the origin of hall states and the role of the scalar field which is necessarily present in this supersymmetric theory .",
    "if the coupling constant is set to zero , the action of the defect theory is for a @xmath1 d5 branes is known to be @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a complex scalar field which is a spinor representation of @xmath33 , the isometry group of the worldvolume @xmath14 , and @xmath34 is a complex fermion which is in a spinor representation of @xmath35 , the isometry group of @xmath17 as well as a spinor of the @xmath36 lorentz group .",
    "the 2-sphere @xmath14 is the one which was originally wrapped by the d5 brane and which the d7 brane worldvolume also wraps .",
    "the 2-sphere @xmath17 is the one which is formed as a fuzzy sphere of d5 branes and which is wrapped by the d7 worldvolume and contains @xmath1 units of d7 worldvolume magnetic flux .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath34 transform in the fundamental representation of the bulk su(n ) gauge group and a flavor su(@xmath1 ) symmetry .",
    "they have a color index which runs from 1 to n and flavor index which runs from 1 to @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that , in the presence of a magnetic field , this system will break the @xmath33 symmetry when there is even an infinitesimally weak interaction . in an external @xmath37 magnetic field ,",
    "the single particle energy levels of the fermions are the landau levels @xmath38 and the scalar field are @xmath39 with @xmath40 in both cases .",
    "the levels are infinitely degenerate .",
    "the density , i.e.  the number of states per unit volume , of a single level is @xmath41 .",
    "the degeneracy of each fermionic landau level is then @xmath42 where the factor of 2 is due to the fact that the fermion is an @xmath43 spinor , @xmath1 and @xmath2 come from the numbers of flavors and colors , respectively .",
    "the bosons have a gap and are not excited at energies less than @xmath44 .",
    "the fermions , on the other hand , have a zero energy mode , @xmath45 which will dominate the low energy properties of the system .",
    "moreover , in the neutral ground state of the system , depicted for the case of one flavor , @xmath30 ( and two @xmath46 isospin states ) , in figure 1 , all negative energy fermion states must be occupied , positive energy states must be empty and the zero modes should be half - filled .",
    "the latter requirement is due to a charge conjugation ( or particle - hole ) symmetry of the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian in a magnetic field .",
    "an arbitrarily weak interaction will have significant influence on the zero modes .",
    "the perturbative shift of the energy of states such as in figure [ fig1 ] due to a weak repulsive interaction like the coulomb interaction is known to be minimal for the states depicted in figure [ fig2 ] , where all of the zero mode fermions take up one of the @xmath46 spinor indices @xcite .",
    "this is similar to , and has the same source as the hund rule for populating electron energy levels of atoms . in rough terms , an interaction like the coulomb interaction , which is repulsive at all scales , would be minimized by keeping the fermions as far apart as possible . since their wavefunction is totally antisymmetric , this is achieved by making it as antisymmetric in particle positions as possible , and therefore as symmetric as possible in the other indices .",
    "symmetry in the flavor indices is maximal if all states have the same index .",
    "this is the symmetry breaking state depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this phenomenon is known in the condensed matter physics literature as quantum hall ferromagnetism and it is the explanation of an experimentally observed feature of some two dimensional electron gases @xcite-@xcite .",
    "magnetic catalysis : with an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction ( such as the coulomb interaction ) , the preferred state is one where all of the zero modes with one label are occupied to obtain the @xmath47 state .",
    "this is the analog of the hund rule for electrons filling atomic orbitals .",
    "it can be shown to minimize the exchange energy .",
    "this is a gapped state which , since the density vanishes , has vanishing hall conductivity . ]",
    "now , assume that interactions have generated a small gap .",
    "first , we observe that this breaks the @xmath46 chiral symmetry and it makes the neutral state a gapped state , where otherwise , if the symmetry was not broken , it would have been ungapped",
    ". what will the system look like if we now vary the density ?",
    "if we begin with the neutral state of figure [ fig2 ] and add fermions we immediately have an ungapped state with the second set of would - be zero modes partially filled .",
    "then , if we continue to add fermions , we will eventually fill all of the remaining would - be zero modes which are now at a small positive energy .",
    "then the completely filled state , depicted in figure [ fig3 ] , also has a gap .",
    "this state is an integer quantum hall state with filling fraction @xmath19 , where in the denominator .",
    "the first intger filling fraction @xmath19 refers to a landau level which is completely filled with baryons , where the baryon is a composite of @xmath2 fundamental representation quarks and has u(1 ) charge n. this color degeneracy is unavoidable here and it is natural if the theory is confining , as one would expect when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , as it is here . ]",
    "@xmath48 the color degeneracy ( @xmath49 of @xmath50 yang - mills theory ) is explicit in our definition of filling fraction .     beginning with the state depicted in figure [ fig2 ] and increasing the chemical potential and charge density eventually results in the @xmath19 state that is depicted here .",
    "the energy needed to excite the first bosonic states is depicted by the dashed line . further increasing",
    "the charge will simply increase the number of bosons excited .",
    "thus , the @xmath19 state is the only quantum hall state in the spectrum . ]    if we continue to increase the density , the next available energy states are where we excite bosons whose gap is @xmath51 .",
    "then there can be no further hall states as all further charge can be accomodated by bosons which do not have a pauli principle .",
    "if we decreased , rather than increased the charge density , particle - hole symmetry tells us that we would also find an incompressible state at @xmath52 .",
    "thus , at weak coupling , when there is only one flavor of fermions , and because of the presence of charged scalar fields , there are only three incompressible states with @xmath53 and only two hall states with @xmath54 . this changes if there are multiple flavors .    for multiple d - branes with @xmath1 flavors of fermions , there are similar arguments to quantum hall ferromagnetism for a complete resolution of the degeneracy of the zero modes so that filling an @xmath33 state for each flavor ( with fermins or holes ) could potentially yield @xmath55 quantum hall states",
    "however , the number of these states which actually become hall states depends on how many fit under the threshold for creating a scalar particle . at very weak coupling",
    "the number is @xmath56 levels with filling fractions @xmath57 and hall conductivities @xmath58 .",
    "an example with @xmath59 is depicted in figure [ fig4 ] .     for @xmath59",
    ", the possible hall states have filling fractions @xmath60 .",
    "the state with @xmath23 is depicted .",
    "there is an energy gap between the fermions in this state and those which must be added to continue filling the remaining zero modes . ]    in effective field theory , the hall conductivity is encoded in a chern - simons term . if , in one of the gapped states , we introduce a background u(1 ) gauge field and then we integrate out the matter fields , the action has a chern simons term @xmath61 when there is a charge gap , the chern - simons term does not renormalize beyond one loop @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is also known that when there is no gap , it can be corrected at higher loops @xcite . at one loop",
    ", the scalar field does not contribute and the fermion gives the result above @xcite@xcite .",
    "the no - renormalization theorem suggests that the filling fraction and hall conductivity of a gapped state could be exact and identical to its value in the weak coupling limit .",
    "it is interesting to check this idea at strong coupling . in this paper",
    ", we indeed find , first of all , the hall state with the lowest integer hall conductivity at filling fraction @xmath19 , and then others with @xmath62 the total number limited by dynamical issues , but bounded from above to be less than or equal to @xmath1 .",
    "one might speculate that these states are strong coupling extrapolations of the ones that are seen in the weak coupling limit .",
    "it is interesting that the upper limit on the strong coupling side comes from the d brane geometry .",
    "we shall also see that the maximum number of hall states is @xmath1 , coming from @xmath1 d5 branes blowing up into @xmath1 d7 branes .",
    "however , it is very possible that only a much smaller number of these states are stable .",
    "the geometric description of the blow - up as a classical sphere with magnetic flux , which our analysis relies on , is also not accurate unless the number of d5-branes which blow up to a d7 is large .",
    "the d7 brane configuration that we shall use in this paper is closely related to that used in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite where one examines a d3-d7 system where the d7 brane worldvolume wraps @xmath64 and the d7 brane is stabilized by putting u(1 ) worldvolume magnetic flux on @xmath17 .",
    "this configuration is called d7@xmath63 and it has been used to construct a model of the hall effect by a mechanism which has some of the ingredients of the one that is used here . both d7 and d7@xmath63 probe branes have also been used to model some phenomena in planar condensed matter systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an important feature of a hall state is that it is incompressible , that is , it has an energy gap for charged excitations . for a probe brane to be incompressible",
    ", it should have a minkowski embedding .",
    "however , to be a hall system , it must also have electric charge and at first sight these are incompatible , as we have discussed above , when a probe brane carries the worldvolume gauge field configurations necessary for its field theory dual to have electric charge , it should have a black hole embedding .",
    "a way around this occurs in the d7@xmath63 system exactly as it does in the system that we are interested in in this paper and it was already used to construct hall states in reference @xcite . in the presence of external magnetic field , the wess - zumino terms in the d7 brane action allow electric charge to be dissolved into the brane worldvolume .",
    "this could occur for discrete values of the ratio of charge density to magnetic field , the filling fraction .",
    "then , in these special cases , the solution for the d7 brane worldvolume is a minkowski embedding with a charge gap .",
    "these were identified as quantized hall states of d7@xmath63 .",
    "due to a different choise of boundary conditions , the filling fractions are not integers in that case . with the types of embedding chosen for d7@xmath63",
    ", some internal magnetic flux on the d7 brane worldvolume was required for stability of the system .",
    "the flux was also quantized and that gave a quantization condition for hall conductivity ( which did not match either the integer or known fractional quantum hall effects ) .",
    "the difference between d7@xmath63 and what we do in the present paper is that we choose a different boundary condition at the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the boundary of @xmath13 must be chosen so that the numerator of the last term in the differential equation which describes the behavior of the 5-sphere latitude at which the d7 brane is embedded , equation ( [ equationforpsi ] ) , vanishes there ( at large @xmath65 in ( [ equationforpsi ] ) ) .",
    "the numerator of that last term is the partial derivative of the expression in the denominator whose large @xmath65 behavior is the ` potential ' @xmath66 we thus need the asymptotic value of @xmath67 to approach an extremum of this potential .",
    "moreover , if we want the fluctuations about the asymptotic value to have two normalizable modes , it is necessary that this extremum is a maximum .",
    "simple calculus tells us that there are either one or two maxima : if @xmath68 , there are two maxima at @xmath69\\right ) $ ] and @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath71 , there is only one maximum at @xmath70 . in reference",
    "@xcite , they used the first maximum . in the present paper , we will consider of the second maximum at @xmath70 .",
    "this as a place where @xmath72 and the d7 brane world - volume degenerates to a six dimensional hypersurface where one of the worldvolume spheres , @xmath17 , has shrunk to zero volume .",
    "this was a sphere carrying magnetic flux .",
    "when it shrinks to a point it leaves a singularity in the form of a point dirac monopole .",
    "this singularity should be interpreted as @xmath73 d5 branes ending at the d7 brane .",
    "in fact , we interprete it as a region where a number @xmath1 of d5 branes takes on a non - abelian configuration and blows up to form the d7 brane .      in section 2 we shall review the problem of determining the geometry of a d5 brane embedded in @xmath5 when the field theory which is its holographic dual has an external magnetic field and charge density . in section 3",
    "we discuss the embedding of the d7 brane with the same external magnetic field and charge density . in section 4",
    "we discuss our numerical solutions for the d5 and d7 brane configurations as well as their energies .",
    "section 5 contains some conclusions .",
    "we shall study the d3-d5 system in the probe limit where the number of d5 branes @xmath1 is much smaller than @xmath2 , the number of d3 branes .",
    "the material of this section is already well known and can be found elsewhere in the literature .",
    "we include it here for the convenience of the reader , and to fix our conventions and notation which will be needed later on when we compare the d5 brane with the d7 brane . on flat space ,",
    "the d3 and d5 branes are oriented as in table 1 .",

    "some of the solutions with their energy densities are shown in figures [ fig5]-[fig12 ] .",
    "when @xmath230 we find stable d7 brane solutions with non - constant @xmath67 for a large range of values of the parameter @xmath123 , including examples in the region where @xmath233 .",
    "this value of @xmath216 is a critical point of the d5 brane where there is a phase transition which restores chiral symmetry .",
    "the situation is very different when @xmath230 where the d7 brane is more stable . in that case , the chiral symmetry breaking persists to larger values of @xmath216 .",
    "we have not been able to determine whether there is a critical value of this parameter .",
    "the competing chirally symmetric solution seems metastable in this region , indicating existence of an energy barrier between the solutions .",
    "therefore one would expect a chiral symmetry restoring phase transition to be of first order , if it exists at all .",
    "we have used a comparison of energies to decide which d brane configurations are more stable .",
    "however , we have not done a full stability analysis . particularly at finite density ,",
    "instabilities to formation of non - translation invariant phases such as striped phases do occur for the d7@xmath63 system @xcite and such instabilities could also appear in the present system .",
    "we have left checking this important possibility for future work .",
    "the mechanism by which we get higher filling fraction hall states is by forming multiple d7 branes which share the total charge density and which each have unit filling fraction @xmath19 . in principle ,",
    "states which have filling fractions @xmath223 could exist .",
    "how many of them exist is a dynamical question .",
    "we have found numerical solutions where @xmath0 is as large as 10 and the hall state still has the lowest energy .    we have used numerical computation to show that , for the first higher filling fraction state @xmath23 , the two d7 branes with @xmath19 are stable in that they have lower energies than the single d7 brane with @xmath23 , which in turn has lower energy than the d5 branes with these parameters .",
    "the main reason for their stability is that they are minkowski embeddings , so they gain energy by not having spikes going to the poincare horizon .",
    "indications are that , in the multi d7 brane solution , at least for @xmath23 , the state with d5 branes evenly distributed between the two d7 branes is favored over asymmetric distributions .",
    "the @xmath0 d7 branes are therefore coincident and have an su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "however , more work on mapping the energy landscape of multiple d7 branes is definitely needed before this is a firm conclusion .",
