    "hard spheres represent the simplest and most versatile model for the description of molecular and colloidal many - particles systems .",
    "this statement is particularly true since 1957 , when wood and jacobson @xcite and alder and wainwright @xcite demonstrated that hard spheres undergo a fluid - to - crystal transition , and therefore that hard interactions alone can account for freezing .",
    "systems of hard cubes , on the other hand , were considered as mere toy models until only a few years ago .",
    "the reason for this is evident : no molecule or macromolecular aggregate found in nature is known to be reasonably approximated by this shape .",
    "however , the interaction between parallel hard cubes is the second - simplest hard interaction one can imagine after that between hard spheres .",
    "its simplicity made this model a perfect object of study for theory and simulation .",
    "early studies on the equation of state of parallel hard squares ( @xmath0 dimensions ) and cubes ( @xmath1 ) date back to the dawn of computer simulation in the 1950s @xcite . soon after , the question regarding the high - packing phase behavior of the models arose . for parallel hard squares ,",
    "a transition from the fluid to a square - lattice crystal ( with quasi - long - range order ) was found @xcite , but its character , whether continuous or discontinuous , has been a matter of debate ever since @xcite .",
    "conversely , the stability of a `` brick - wall '' smectic phase with one - dimensional ordering in rows ( or columns ) was suggested to exist for parallel hard squares , but the stability of this peculiar state was soon ruled out @xcite .",
    "similarly , parallel hard cubes manifest a fluid - to - crystal transition with a well - established second - order character @xcite and no stable phase with lower translational symmetry than the crystal is expected @xcite .    in the mid-1990s , while the interest of the liquid - state community was focusing on mixtures of hard spheres , hard cubes were rediscovered . by means of computer simulation dijkstra et al . showed evidence of a demixing transition in a binary system of parallel hard cubes on a lattice , thus demonstrating that additive hard interactions can induce an entropy - driven fluid - fluid phase separation @xcite .",
    "these results motivated cuesta and martnez - ratn to face the problem by means of density functional theory .",
    "following the pioneering approach developed by rosenfeld for hard spheres @xcite , they developed a fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) @xcite formalism aimed at describing both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phase behavior of mixtures of squares and cubes @xcite .    since the early work on hard squares and cubes , the progress in colloidal particles synthesis has been enormous .",
    "in particular , colloidal suspensions of micron - sized cubes @xcite and quasi - two - dimensional square platelets @xcite have been recently produced and analyzed .",
    "these experimental advances led to a renewed interest in the model , and at present more complex aspects like the role of orientational degrees of freedom , the addition of dipolar interactions , the roundedness of the shape and the effect of vacancies in the freezing mechanism constitute objects of intense research @xcite .",
    "far from being a toy model or a mere academic exercise , squares and cubes have therefore gained a key role as model systems of non - spherical colloidal particles .",
    "besides the development of new theories @xcite , the increasing attention towards the self - assembly of non - spherical particles requires a detailed analysis of the capabilities of the existing ones .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reinvestigate the prediction of fundamental measure theory as formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the phase behavior of parallel hard squares and cubes .",
    "the focus of our attention points to the freezing transition and the structure of the high - density inhomogeneous phases .",
    "in particular , by exploiting present - day computer power we improve previous analyses on the subject by performing a _ free minimization _ of the density functional , and compare our results with those obtained by means of the widely applied gaussian parameterization of the single - particle density .",
    "we observe good overall agreement between the two methods , the main drawbacks of the gaussian parameterization being ( i ) a systematic albeit small underestimation of the equilibrium vacancy concentration in the crystal and ( ii ) the lack of anisotropy of the crystal density peaks at high enough density .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge this work constitutes the first density - functional theory study of the hard - square system .",
    "we show that fundamental measure theory surprisingly predicts a smectic phase absent in computer simulation and suggests that , in analogy with the hard - cube system , vacancies can play a crucial role in the freezing transition .",
    "the density - functional theory route to the equilibrium properties of a many - body system consists of expressing the intrinsic helmholtz free energy @xmath2 as a functional of the single - particle density @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when considering a system composed of a single species of particles having only translational ( and no rotational ) degrees of freedom in @xmath4 dimensions , the free - energy functional reads    @xmath5 = \\int d^d \\mathbf{r } \\ , \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) \\bigl \\ { \\log[\\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) \\lambda^3]-1 \\bigr \\ } + \\beta \\mathcal{f}^{\\mathrm{exc}}[\\rho],\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is a @xmath4-dimensional vector , @xmath7 is the inverse temperature in units of the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 the thermal wavelength and the integrals are performed over the ( @xmath4-dimensional ) volume @xmath9 occupied by the system . the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "our attention focuses on the predictions for the freezing transition and the properties of the crystal phase . in density - functional theory the typical approach for describing crystal phases is based on the parameterization of the single - particle density by a sum of gaussian functions centered on the lattice sites .",
    "we compare these predictions with a more accurate free - minimization method , where the single - particle density is evaluated on a grid of points .    despite its simplicity , we conclude that for both squares and cubes the gaussian parameterization works remarkably well .",
    "apart from some inadequacy of the gaussian ansatz in describing the anisotropy of the single - particle density of the crystal , the main deviations between the two minimization methods lie in the expected vacancy concentrations of the square and simple - cubic crystals , which appears to be slightly underestimated by the gaussian ansatz . on the other hand , as already noticed for cubes , fmt suffers from a serious inability to give quantitatively reliable values for the freezing packing fraction .",
    "however , improvement in this direction can be achieved only by a reformulation of the theory itself , as the numerical minimization is performed exactly .",
    "for the three - dimensional system of parallel hard cubes our results coincide with previous fmt analysis based on the gaussian parameterization and indicate a second - order vacancy - rich fluid - to - crystal transition . for the parallel hard - square system",
    ", this work constitutes to the best of our knowledge the first analysis based on density - functional theory .",
    "in contrast with previous simulation studies , fundamental measure theory predicts a stable smectic phase in between the low - density fluid and the high - density square crystal .",
    "however , by taking into account the effect of long - wavelength thermal fluctuations , one can show the one - dimensional smectic ordering to be unstable .",
    "therefore , we deduce that the mean - field character of the theory , which is unable to properly take into account the role of fluctuations from equilibirum , is the element to be blamed for this artifact .",
    "when big enough simulation boxes are considered , computer simulations with periodic boundary conditions comfirm the picture of an unstable smectic phase @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to notice that , when the simulation box is small enough , ordering of the squares in parallel layers was observed @xcite . on the basis of these observations ,",
    "it is tempting to conclude that , when long - wavelength fluctuations can be neglected , the behavior of the system coincides with the predictions of fmt , showing a stable smectic phase . in other words , we expect parallel - squares systems to develop intermediate smectic states in finite size systems and under the effect of confining walls .    for what concerns the original problem regarding the phase behavior of parallel hard squares in the thermodynamic limit , the conclusions we can draw are more limited .",
    "in fact , on the basis of our theoretical results we do not have enough elements to deduce which of the two phases , either the fluid or the crystal , is the stable one in the density range where the theory predicts a stable smectic .",
    "therefore , we can not conclude whether the theory predicts a low - density second - order freezing transition with a high vacancy concentration in the crystal , or a higher - density weakly first - order freezing with a lower vacancy concentration .",

    "<S> due to remarkable advances in colloid synthesis techniques , systems of squares and cubes , once an academic abstraction for theorists and simulators , are nowadays an experimental reality . by means of a free minimization of the free - energy functional , we apply fundamental measure theory to analyze the phase behavior of parallel hard squares and hard cubes . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those obtained by the traditional approach based on the gaussian parameterization , finding small deviations and good overall agreement between the two methods . for hard squares our predictions feature at intermediate packing fraction a smectic phase , which is however expected to be unstable due to thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for hard squares the theory predicts either a vacancy - rich second - order transition or a vacancy - poor weakly first - order phase transition at higher density . in accordance with previous studies , a second - order transition with a high vacancy concentration </S>",
    "<S> is predicted for hard cubes . </S>"
