    "energy shifts of atomic levels due to interactions with black - body radiation are primarily important for rydberg states , where large dipole polarizabilities enhance the magnitude of the effect  @xcite , but at the current rate of advance of high - precision spectroscopy , its importance for the correct realization of frequency standards has also been stressed in the literature  @xcite . in particular , the work of farley and wing  @xcite was mainly focused on rydberg states , which were accessible to high - precision spectroscopy at the time .",
    "in contrast , we here focus on the ground state and on the @xmath0 state of hydrogen and hydrogenlike ions . the transition frequencies in these systems have only recently come within reach of high - precision laser spectroscopy , due to the development of frequency combs . in all cases studied by farley and wing  @xcite , the lamb shift and fine structure shifts could be neglected , but this does not hold for the transitions studied here .",
    "ionization by black - body radiation also is an important effect for excited atomic states .",
    "the ionization process leads to a finite width of the states ( resonances ) , with the energy acquiring a ( small ) imaginary part .",
    "the sign of the imaginary part is negative , and we can write the black - body induced energy shift @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the real part of the energy shift , and @xmath4 is the black - body induced width .",
    "several peculiarities characterize the black - body induced radiative shift .",
    "first of all , we recall that two virtual processes contribute : one where the atom absorbs a black - body photon and then returns to the reference state by emission into the same mode of the electromagnetic field from which a photon had been absorbed , and another one where the sequence of absorption and emission processes is reversed .",
    "this is very much analogous to the so - called ac stark shift ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that an atom feels in a laser field , but with the difference that the black - body radiation is isotropic , and that the polarization vectors are equally distributed among all possible directions in space . for the ground state being the reference state , the `` width '' ( imaginary part of the energy shift )",
    "is exclusively generated by the absorption - first channel , where one of the propagator denominators becomes resonant and the virtual state takes the role of the final state of the ionization or excitation process  @xcite .",
    "note that recently  @xcite , a finite width has been predicted for the ground state of hydrogen at very high temperatures on the basis of field - theoretical considerations [ see eq .",
    "( 23 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "one observation , potentially of fundamental interest , substantiated here by a concrete calculation , is that even the @xmath5 state of atomic hydrogen , acquires a finite width when the hydrogen atom is exposed to black - body radiation , although the ground state of the most fundamental atomic system is otherwise assumed to be the perfect `` asymptotic state '' used in all @xmath6-matrix type calculations regarding the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) shifts of energy levels  @xcite .",
    "however , before we come to an analysis of this effect , we briefly revisit the evaluation of the real part of the black - body induced energy shifts , for the @xmath5@xmath0 transition in hydrogen  @xcite and ionized helium ( see sec .",
    "[ realparts ] ) .",
    "we then analyze the imaginary parts of the black - body induced energy shifts in sec .",
    "[ imagparts ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",

    "for clarity , we keep all factors of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in all calculations .",
    "the boltzmann constant is denoted @xmath10 .",

    "( 20 ) of ref .",
    "then , the black - body energy shift @xmath18 is given by the formulas    @xmath19 \\label{ebb } \\delta e_{\\mathrm{bb } } ( ns ) = & - \\frac { e^2 } { 2 } \\ , ( { \\mathrm{p.v . } } ) \\int\\limits_0^\\infty { \\mathrm d}\\nu\\ , \\vec e^{\\,2}(\\nu ) \\ , p_{\\nu}(ns ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the energy of the reference @xmath17 state .",
    "the latter integral actually has to be taken as a principal - value ( p.v . )",
    "integral because the propagator denominators in ( [ pol ] ) can become singular when a black - body photon hits an atomic resonance ( see the discussion below in sec .",
    "[ imagparts ] ) .    for the @xmath5 state ,",
    "the properties of the dipole polarizability @xmath21 are well understood  @xcite , and @xmath21 can be evaluated using an entirely nonrelativistic approximation  @xcite , and @xmath22 in may be replaced by the schrdinger hamiltonian . to see why that is the case ,",
    "let us consider the typical photon frequencies at which the black - body photon energy peaks .",
    "ignoring the `` @xmath23 '' in the denominator of , it is easy to derive the result @xmath24 for the frequency at which @xmath25 assumes its maximum value .",
