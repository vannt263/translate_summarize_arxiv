    "this note is devoted to heyting algebras with involution , i.e. the automorphism of order two . using the one - to - one correspondence between the set of all congruences of a heyting algebra with involution and the set of all involutive filters of the algebra , we prove that any finite heyting algebra with involution is quasi - primal .",
    "r.  w.  quackenbush in [ 12 ] gives in terms of boolean powers a nice characterization of injective algebras in a variety generated by a quasi - primal algebra .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the result of r.  w.  quackenbush can be applied to heyting algebras with involution . combining the quackenbush s result with our description of boolean powers of quasi - primal algebras with lattice reducts",
    ", we prove that injectives in the variety generated by a finite heyting algebra @xmath0 are diagonal subalgebras of some direct power of @xmath0 , which are complete as lattices .",
    "the sketch of the main points of this paper can be found in [ 10 ] , which is devoted to some discriminator subclass of heyting algebras with involution , namely , heyting algebras with regular involution .",
    "this subclass of heyting algebras with involution is semi - simple and contains simple algebras of arbitrary cardinality [ 10 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that if a variety has the minimal nontrivial algebra embeddable in any nontrivial algebra of this variety , and for any cardinal @xmath1 there exists a simple algebra of cardinality @xmath1 , then there are no nontrivial injectives in this variety .",
    "that is why we focus our interest on the description of injectives in varieties generated by some finite heyting algebras with involution .    our motivation to study heyting algebras with involution comes from many - valued logic .",
    "in [ 7 ] we showed that linearly ordered heyting algebras with involution are the algebraic models of fuzzy propositional logic .",
    "generalization of the methods of the paper mentioned lead us to the notion of heyting algebra with regular involution [ 8 ] .",
    "it must be mentioned that heyting algebras with involution are considered in [ 2 ] under the name `` involutive skolem algebras '' , and in [ 3 ] the duality theory for these algebras is announced .",
    "in this section we will introduce the definitions and we will provide some equations which are satisfied in the variety of heyting algebras with involution .    an algebra @xmath2 is a _ heyting algebra _ if @xmath3 is a bounded lattice ; @xmath4 is a binary operation on @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is an unary operation of pseudocomplementation defined by @xmath8 , or , in other terms , @xmath9 .",
