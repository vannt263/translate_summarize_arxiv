    "an empirical relation between their maximum brightness and light curve decline rate @xcite makes type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) one of the best tools to measure cosmological distances . using this approach @xcite and",
    "@xcite discovered that our universe undergoes an accelerated expansion .",
    "this was in turn interpreted as evidence for the existence of ` dark energy ' ( e.g.  @xcite ) . despite this importance for astrophysics and",
    "cosmology our knowledge about the progenitor systems or the explosion mechanisms of these luminous events is still limited .",
    "they are commonly believed to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "however , many aspects are still unclear ; e.g. the masses of the exploding stars , the nature of the companion star , the ignition conditions , the exact mechanism of the burning process or the origin of the various subclasses of sne  ia .",
    "systematic uncertainties arising from this ignorance are one factor limiting the precision of cosmological measurements .",
    "one way to improve our understanding of these objects is the comparison of observed spectra with predictions from theoretical models .",
    "this , however , requires complete data sets with a wide wavelength coverage @xcite .",
    "in particular , the near - infrared ( nir ) regime has been proposed as a useful tool to discriminate between different explosion models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the lower opacity in the nir enables us to look deeper into the ejecta and thus probe layers still hidden to optical observations at the same epochs .",
    "also , the nir is believed to be less severely affected by line blending compared to optical or ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths @xcite . at the same time , however , observations suggest sne  ia to be excellent nir standard candles ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , in contrast to optical wavelengths where they can only be used as standard__izeable _ _ candles . this result was confirmed by a series of toy explosion models @xcite . while the homogeneity in the nir might point towards a common explosion mechanism for all sne  ia ,",
    "it could also mean that the nir photons are not as sensitive to variations in the ejecta as previously suggested .    while optical spectra have been studied quite extensively ,",
    "the nir regime is still comparatively unexplored .",
    "although there are quite a few publications containing nir spectra of sne  ia ( e.g. @xcite ) one has to realize that for many sne there is only one spectrum available  typically at post - maximum epochs  or that the objects are of a peculiar subclass .",
    "the number of well - sampled _ normal _ sne  ia with pre - maximum - light observations in the nir is actually quite small . @xcite",
    "have published six spectra of sn  1994d , @xcite eleven spectra of sn  1999ee , @xcite six spectra of sn  2002bo , @xcite four spectra of sn  2002dj , @xcite ten spectra of sn  2003cg and @xcite four spectra of sn  2005am .",
    "moreover , there are 14 spectra of sn  2003du out to the nebular phase , published by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in order to increase the sample of sne  ia with good nir coverage we present and analyze a set of nine nir spectra of sn  2005cf , ranging from @xmath4d to @xmath5d with respect to @xmath2-band maximum .",
    "sn  2005cf , according to @xcite ` the golden standard type ia supernova ' , is a spectroscopically normal sn  ia with a more complete data set than most other sne  ia .",
    "optical and nir photometry as well as optical spectroscopy of sn  2005cf have been published by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "uv photometry and spectroscopy have been published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table [ table : sn2005cf_properties ] summarizes the most important properties of sn  2005cf : at @xmath2-band maximum , it had a magnitude of @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 lies between 1.07 @xcite and 1.12 @xcite , and the derived ^56^ni mass is about 0.7@xmath8 @xcite or 0.78@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds quite well to the average values obtained for normal sne  ia .",
    "an important shortcoming of the data set of sn  2005cf has so far been the lack of published nir spectroscopy .",
    "this deficiency is now remedied with the data presented in this work .",
    ".properties of sn  2005cf , as derived in the literature .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      +    we note that the small number of contributing lines makes it possible to deblend the @xmath9-band region and derive the extension of the emitting co - rich core independently from invoking a complex modelling machinery . as a simple recipe ,",
    "this can be accomplished by fitting gaussians to each contributing emission line , keeping the central wavelengths fixed and enforcing a common full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in velocity space .",
    "the fwhm which  besides the individual intensities  is a fit parameter , then gives an estimate for the extension of the emitting co - rich core .",
    "note , however , that there is not necessarily a one - to - one correspondence between the two quantities so these velocities are only indicative .",
    "applying this technique to our spectra of sn  2005cf using 8 gaussians corresponding to the aforementioned  lines ( table  [ rollercoaster ] ) , we find that the wavelength region between @xmath320800  and @xmath325000  is adequately reproduced with a fwhm velocity of @xmath311000  for the spectra at + 31 and + 41d .",
    "slightly smaller fwhm velocities of @xmath310000 to 10200  are derived for the + 29d spectrum of sn  2002bo and the + 32 and + 42d spectra of sn  1999ee .",
    "these numbers are in rough agreement with the extension of the iron - group - element zone in w7 where those elements are abundant at the 10 per - cent level at a velocity of 10600 , and drop to a mass fraction of 1 per cent at 12300 .",
    "the fair match could already be expected from the rough agreement between the spectra of sn  2005cf and the model spectra of w7 .",
    "it is , however , no validation of the w7 model , since in detail there are numerous other differences between the model and the observed spectrum .",
    "we have presented nir spectroscopy of sn  2005cf covering epochs from @xmath0d to @xmath1d with respect to @xmath2-band maximum .",
    "together with archival data at other wavelengths this makes sn  2005cf one of the currently best - observed sne  ia and allowed us to compile combined uv - optical - nir spectra at five epochs between @xmath38d before and @xmath310d after maximum light . in this respect",
    "sn  2005cf is a unique object since to our best knowledge thus far only a single uv - through - nir spectrum of a sn  ia has been published by @xcite for sn  2011iv .",
    "a comparison of our spectra to observations of sne  1999ee @xcite , 2002bo @xcite and 2003du @xcite shows that sn  2005cf is a perfectly normal sn  ia at nir wavelengths .",
    "a similar conclusion has already been drawn at optical wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also performed radiative - transfer simulations to obtain nir spectra for the standard hydrodynamical explosion model w7 @xcite . comparing the obtained synthetic spectra to our spectra of sn  2005cf",
    "we find that w7 reproduces the key properties of normal sne  ia not only at uv - optical as reported in earlier work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also at nir wavelengths .",
    "from a detailed analysis of the emission processes in the radiative - transfer simulation we have identified the main spectral features in the nir .",
    "we find only a single clear p - cygni line : the  @xmath1010926 triplet which is present at early epochs . apart from that the nir part of the spectrum is almost devoid of absorption features . instead , fluorescence is the driving mechanism that shapes the sed of sne  ia . before maximum light",
    "both intermediate - mass elements and iron - group elements contribute to the fluorescent emission .",
    "after maximum light almost all the flux originates from iron - group elements , though different iron - group species contribute to the various nir bands .",
    "this makes the @xmath11 and @xmath12 colours a few weeks after maximum light potential probes to the ratio of different iron - group species . while most of the fluorescent emission is strongly blended , we find that the characteristic humps which form at about a month after maximum light in the @xmath9 band result from a series of relatively unblended lines .",
    "this provides a simple possibility to constrain the iron - group - element - rich regions of the ejecta from observed spectra .",
    "the authors thank f. bufano and v. stanishev for providing archival observations .",
    "additional data were obtained from the online supernova spectrum archive ( suspect ) .",
