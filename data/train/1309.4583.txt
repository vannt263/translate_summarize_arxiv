    "that is , the hump structure appears gradually for @xmath143 and the rapid decay at a large @xmath108 becomes clear for @xmath144 .",

    "figure 9(c ) shows the magnitude distributions at @xmath124 , and 0.25 for the whole clusters at @xmath138 .",

    "the carlson - langer model of earthquakes has been studied by many authors . however , its complicated intermittent dynamics remains to be completely understood , and the effect of the asperity was not investigated in the model .",
    "we have numerically investigated the mechanism of the spatio - temporal intermittency for @xmath45 and the effect of asperity on the magnitude distribution using percolation clusters .",
    "we have shown that the intermittent behavior appears in a two - block system for @xmath45 , and explained the behavior using a one - dimensional map .",
    "we have proposed a simplified viewpoint for the intermittent spatio - temporal chaos in a larger one - dimensional system at @xmath45 , using the result of the two - block system and the quantity @xmath96 expressing spatial irregularity .",
    "that is , a sequence of small slips makes the profile of @xmath103 uniform , and then a large slip occurs on a nearly flat profile of @xmath103 .",
    "the duration of the large slip is long and the spatial irregularity of @xmath103 is amplified during a long simultaneous slip . after the large slip , small slips occur again in the rough profile of @xmath103",
    ". it might be a new viewpoint that the small slips actively prepare the condition s for a large slip , because slips of all sizes are usually considered to reduce the stress , decreasing the probability of large earthquakes .",
    "we have checked that a power - law behavior in the slip size distribution appears at the intermediate @xmath116 in the one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "then , we have performed a numerical simulation on percolation clusters on the square lattice , taking the concept of asperities of various sizes into consideration .",
    "the magnitude distribution of the total slip - size on percolation clusters obeys a power law of the exponent @xmath153 near @xmath28 at the critical point of @xmath138 .",
    "the range of the power law is reduced as @xmath135 deviates from @xmath154 .",
    "this might be related to the fractal asperity hypothesis .",
    "we have checked that a similar power law is obtained for a percolation cluster on a triangular lattice .",
    "we have obtained a power law of @xmath153 in the carlson - langer model on percolation clusters ; however , we are not sure whether the power law is directly related to the gutenberg - richter law , because the power law of @xmath153 appears only under special conditions : @xmath116 and @xmath155 , and there is no reason for these special values in nature .",
    "there are controversies regarding the self - organized criticality theory vs the fractal asperity theory for explaining the origin of the gutenberg - richter law .",
    "our numerical results of the carlson - langer model do not directly support either theory .",
    "that is , a special parameter @xmath13 needs to be chosen for the power laws , which does not support the theory of self - organized criticality .",
    "the fractal distribution at @xmath138 does not always lead to a power law , which does not support the fractal asperity theory .",
    "our model might be in an intermediate of the two theories , in that spatial irregularity is self - organized by the intermittent dynamics of the deterministic model , and that the fractal asperity can be included in the model .",
