    "inertial particles play an important role in various applications in science and engineering .",
    "examples include planet formation , particle aggregation in rotating flows , atmosphere / ocean science ( in particular rain initiation @xcite ) , chemical engineering .",
    "the prominent role that inertial particles play in various scientific and industrial applications has triggered many theoretical investigations , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the starting point for many theoretical investigations concerning inertial particles is stokes law which says that the force exerted by the fluid on the particle is proportional to the difference between the background fluid velocity and the particle velocity : @xmath0 various extensions of this basic model have been considered in the literature , in particular by maxey and collaborators @xcite . in this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the analysis of particles subject to a force of the form , together with additional molecular bombardment .    in principle",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath1 satisfies either the euler or the navier stokes equations and it is obtained through direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "the solution of a newtonian particle governed by force law coupled to either the euler or navier  stokes equations is analytically difficult to study and computationally expensive .",
    "it is hence useful to consider @xmath1 in to be a given random field @xmath1 which mimics some of the features of velocity fields obtained from dns ; one can consider , for example , random fields whose energy spectrum is consistent with that of velocity fields obtained from dns .",
    "the qualitative study of newtonian particles governed by for given ( random ) velocity fields is very similar to the theory of turbulent diffusion @xcite , which has been primarily developed in the case @xmath2 .",
    "however , relatively little is known about the properties of solutions in the inertial case .",
    "it is important , therefore , to consider simplified models for the velocity field @xmath1 which render the particle dynamics amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis and careful numerical investigations .    a model for the motion of inertial particles in two dimensions",
    "was introduced in @xcite and analyzed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "this model consists of motion in a force field comprised of a contribution from stokes law together with molecular bombardment ; the velocity field is a gaussian , markovian , divergence  free random field .",
    "this gives the equations    [ e : motion ] @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    the parameter @xmath6 is the stokes number , which is a non  dimensional measure of the particle inertia ( essentially it is the particle relaxation time ) .",
    "the molecular diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath7 , @xmath8 is white noise in @xmath9 , @xmath10 is space  time gaussian white noise and @xmath11 are appropriate positive , self  adjoint operators .",
    "gaussian velocity fields of the form have been considered by various authors in the past , in particular in the context of passive advection .",
    "see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the usefulness of random velocity fields of the form in simulations is that , by choosing the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 appropriately , we can generate random velocity fields with a given energy spectrum , thus creating caricatures of realistic turbulent flows .",
    "generalizations to arbitrary dimension @xmath14 are also possible    various qualitative properties of the system have been studied , such as existence and uniqueness of solutions and existence of a random attractor @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various limits of physical interest have been studied : rapid decorrelation in time ( kraichnan ) limits @xcite .",
    "diffusive scaling limits ( homogenization ) were studied for time independent , periodic in space velocity fields ; thus the model is obtained from with @xmath15 only @xcite . in these three papers",
    "it was shown that the rescaled process @xmath16 converges in distribution in the limit as @xmath17 to a brownian motion with a nonnegative definite effective diffusivity @xmath18 .",
    "various properties of the effective diffusivity , in particular , the dependence of @xmath18 on the parameters of the problem @xmath19 were studied by means of formal asymptotics and extensive numerical simulations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to carry out a similar analysis for the model problem where the velocity field is time - dependent .",
    "when @xmath20 , i.e. the particle inertia is negligible , the equation of motion becomes @xmath21 this equation has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "the homogenization problem for with velocity fields of the form , was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the rescaled process , with @xmath22 being the solution of and @xmath1 being a finite dimensional truncation of solutions to , , converges in distribution to a brownian motion with a positive definite covariance matrix , the _ effective diffusivity_.    in this paper we will show that a similar result holds for the inertial particles problem .",
    "that is , we consider the diffusive rescaling for solutions to with @xmath1 being a galerkin truncation of .",
    "we show , first with the aid of formal multiple scale expansions and then rigorously , that the rescaled processes converges to a brownian motion and we derive a formula for the effective diffusion tensor .",
    "we study various properties of the effective diffusivity as well as some scaling limits of physical interest .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the dependence of the effective diffusivity @xmath18 on the various parameters of the problem through numerical simulations . in particular",
    ", we show that the effective diffusivity depends on the stokes number @xmath6 in a very complicated , highly nonlinear way ; this leads to various interesting , physically motivated , questions .",
    "the generator of the markov diffusion process corresponding to is not a uniformly elliptic operator , as in the case of passive tracers , but a degenerate , _ hypoelliptic _ operator .",
    "this renders the proof of the homogenization theorem for quite involved , since rather sophisticated tools from the spectral theory of hypoelliptic operators are required  see the appendix .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the exact model that we will analyze and present some of its properties . in section [ sec : mult_sc ] we use the method of multiple scales to derive the homogenized equation . in section",
    "[ sec : small_delta ] we study simultaneously the problems of homogenization and rapid decorrelation in time . in section 5",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations .",
    "section 6 is reserved for conclusions .",
    "the rigorous homogenization theorem is stated and proved in the appendix .",
    "we will study the following model for the motion of an inertial particle in @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath8 is a standard white noise process on @xmath23 , i.e. a mean zero generalized gaussian process with @xmath26 the velocity field @xmath1 is of the form @xmath27 where for each fixed @xmath28 , @xmath29 is an @xmath30 matrix smooth and periodic as a function of @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is a stationary generalized ornstein  uhlenbeck process on @xmath32 : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a standard gaussian white noise process on @xmath35 , which is independent from @xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are positive definite @xmath38 matrices .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 controls the correlation time of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xmath8 .",
    "we remark that one can construct a velocity field through a finite dimensional truncation of .",
    "notice however that we do not assume that the velocity field @xmath1 is incompressible as such an assumption is not needed for the analysis .",
    "we will , however , restrict ourselves to incompressible velocity fields when studying the problem numerically in section [ sec : numerics ] , as this case is physically interesting .",
    "it is sometimes more convenient for the subsequent analysis to consider the rescaled ou process @xmath40 . written in terms of @xmath41 ,",
    "the equations that govern the motion of inertial particles become    [ e : motion_resc ] @xmath42 @xmath43    the velocity field that appears in is a mean zero stationary gaussian random field with correlation time @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that in the limit as @xmath44 ( the rapid decorrelation in time limit ) the solution of converges pathwise to the solution of @xmath45 the kraichnan  like velocity field @xmath46 is mean zero , gaussian , and delta  correlated in time .",
    "we will refer to as the _ colored velocity field model _ and to as the _ white velocity field model_.    in this paper we will be mostly concerned with the diffusive limit of solutions to and .",
    "that is , we will consider the rescaled process and study the limit as @xmath17 .",
    "a natural question is whether the homogenization ( @xmath17 ) and rapid decorrelation in time ( @xmath44 ) limits commute .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative through using formal asymptotics as well as through numerical investigations .",
    "in this section we will derive the homogenized equation which describes the motion of inertial particles at large length and time scales for both the colored and white noise velocity fields .",
    "the derivation of the homogenized equation is based on multiscale / homogenization techniques @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent pedagogical introduction to such methods .",
    "we start by rescaling the equations of motion according to @xmath47 , @xmath48 . using the fact that for any white noise process we have that @xmath49 in law we obtain :    [ e : color_mult_resc ] @xmath50    we now introduce two new variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 and write the above equations as a first order system :    [ e : sde_resc ] @xmath53    with the understanding that @xmath54 and with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 being standard brownian motions on @xmath23 and @xmath32 , respectively .",

    "@xmath68    we use the subscript @xmath69 on the last two operators to emphasize that they are the generators of ornstein - uhlenbeck processes in @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath72 is the generator of the markov process @xmath73",
    ":    [ e : fast_proc ] @xmath74    in the appendix we prove that the markov process @xmath75 given by is geometrically ergodic . hence , there exists a unique invariant measure with smooth density @xmath76 which is the solution of the stationary fokker ",
    "planck equation @xmath77 here @xmath78 are the formal @xmath79adjoints of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the invariant density @xmath82 is a periodic function of @xmath83 and decays rapidly as @xmath84 .    in the appendix",
    "we also prove that the operator @xmath85 ( equipped with boundary conditions described above ) has compact resolvent in the appropriate function space .",
    "consequently , fredholm theory applies : the null space of the generator @xmath72 is one dimensional and consists of constants in @xmath86 .",
    "( see the appendix ) .",
    "moreover the equation @xmath87 , has a unique ( up to constants ) solution if and only if @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we assume that that the average of the velocity with respect to the invariant density @xmath91 vanishes : @xmath92 this is natural because it removes any effective drift making a purely diffusive scaling natural .",
    "the identity @xmath93 implies that @xmath94 consequently : @xmath95 thus , the centering condition is equivalent to : @xmath96    let us now proceed with the derivation of the homogenized equation .",
    "we look for a solution of in the form of a power series in @xmath97 : @xmath98 with @xmath99 being @xmath100periodic in @xmath83 .",
    "we substitute into ( [ e : kolm_resc ] ) and obtain the following sequence of equations :    [ e : e0e1e2 ] @xmath101    from , we deduce that the first term in the expansion is independent of the fast variables @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath103 . now equation becomes : @xmath104 we can solve this by using separation of variables .",
    "it is easy to show , however , that this term does not affect the homogenized equation and for simplicity we set it equal to @xmath105 . ] : @xmath106 with @xmath107 this is the _ cell problem _ which is posed on @xmath108 .",
    "assumption implies that the right hand side of the the above equation is centered with respect to the invariant measure of the fast process .",
    "hence the equation is well posed ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for this pde are that @xmath109 is periodic in @xmath83 and that it belongs to @xmath110 , which implies sufficiently fast decay at infinity .",
    "we now proceed with .",
    "we apply the solvability condition to obtain : @xmath111 thus , the backward kolmogorov equation which governs the dynamics on large scales is @xmath112 where the effective diffusivity is given by @xmath113 and where @xmath114 denotes the tensor ( or outer ) product .",
    "notice that only the symmetric part of the effective diffusivity @xmath115 is relevant in the homogenized equation . however , the effective diffusivity @xmath115 itself is non  symmetric in general .",
    "we define @xmath116      equation is the backward kolmogorov equation corresponding to a pure brownian motion .",
    "we have the following result : for @xmath62 and @xmath117 the function @xmath118 , where @xmath22 solves , is approximated by @xmath119 solving @xmath120 with @xmath121 and where @xmath122 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath123    a theorem , justifying the formal approximation leading to this result , is proved in the appendix , using the martingale central limit theorem .      in this subsection",
    "we show that the effective diffusivity is non negative .",
    "this implies that the homogenization equation is well posed .",
    "we can show this by using the dirichlet form ( theorem 6.12 in @xcite ) which shows that , for every sufficiently smooth @xmath124 , @xmath125    now let @xmath126 be the solution of the poisson equation and define @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is an arbitrary unit vector .",
    "the scalar field @xmath129 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath130 we combine with , to calculate @xmath131 since @xmath132 is a positive definite matrix .",
    "thus the following results holds : the effective diffusivity matrix @xmath115 given by is positive semi - definite and thus the limiting backward kolmogorov equation is well posed .",
    "it is not entirely straightforward to check whether the centering condition or , equivalently , is satisfied or not , as we do nt have a formula for the invariant measure of the fast process ",
    "we only know that it exists .",
    "it is possible , however , to identify some general classes of flows @xmath1 which satisfy by using symmetry arguments .",
    "consider for example the case of a parity invariant flow , i.e a flow satisfying the condition @xmath133 it follows from and that the invariant density satisfies @xmath134 it is easy to see now that implies that is satisfied .",
    "hence , the centering condition is satisfied for velocity fields @xmath1 that are odd functions of @xmath28 .",
    "[ rem : drift ] even if the centering condition is not satisfied , the large - scale , long - time dynamics of the inertial particle is still governed by an effective brownian motion , provided that we study the problem in a frame co - moving with the mean flow . indeed ,",

    "the covariance matrix of the limiting brownian motion is nonnegative define .",
    "indeed , let @xmath128 be an arbitrary unit vector , define @xmath150 and use the dirichlet form ( theorem 6.12 in @xcite ) @xmath151 thus we have the following result :    the effective diffusivity matrix @xmath152 given by is positive semi - definite and thus the associated backward kolmogorov equation is well posed .",
    "an important observation is that the centering condition for the white noise problem is always satisfied .",
    "indeed , let @xmath153 , @xmath154 and use the identity @xmath155 together with integrations by parts to deduce that @xmath156 this suffices for solvability of .",
    "hence , the long  time , large ",
    "scale behavior of solutions to is always diffusive .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of the colored velocity field , where an additional condition , equation , has to be imposed to ensure diffusive large scale dynamics .",
    "consider the rescaled equation  , and denote its solution by @xmath157 .",
    "it is clear that if we first take the limit as @xmath158 and then the limit @xmath17 , then @xmath157 converges to a brownian motion with covariance matrix @xmath152 given by eqn .  , without having to impose any centering condition .",
    "a natural question arises as to what happens if we interchange the order with which we take the limits @xmath159 . in this section",
    "we show that the two limits commute under the additional assumption that the centering condition is satisfied .",
    "in particular we have the following result : [ r : inter ] let @xmath160 be positive definite matrices that commute and assume that the centering condition is satisfied . then for @xmath161 the effective diffusivity @xmath18 from the colored noise model given by admits the asymptotic expansion @xmath162 where @xmath152 is given by .",

    "it is straightforward to show that exactly the same result holds even when the centering condition is not satisfied . in this case",

    "the numerical solution of degenerate poisson equations of this form is an interesting problem which we leave for future study .",

    "the ou processes converges to @xmath105 .",
    "it is expected , therefore , that in either of these two limits the solution of the stokes equation converges to the solution of @xmath243 and , consequently , in this limit the effective diffusivity is simply the molecular diffusion coefficient .",
    "this result can be derived using techniques from e.g. ( chapter 9 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , when either @xmath244 or @xmath245 , the ou process dominates the behavior of solutions to the stokes equation and , consequently , the effective diffusivity is controlled by the ou process .",
    "the above intuition is supported by the numerical experiments presented in figure [ fig : k_vs_alpha_lambda ] .",
