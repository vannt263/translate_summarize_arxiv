    "empirical evidence has shown that the dynamics of inter - event times driven by human actions may not be random and not well approximated by poisson processes  @xcite .",
    "based on this , barabsi  @xcite developed a very interesting model of human activity where the distribution of the inter - event time is a consequence of a decision queue processes .",
    "he considers that among the most relevant protocols for driving human dynamics , e.g. first - in - first - out protocol , random protocol and a protocol based on the execution of the high priority item , this later protocol seems to be the most important . in this protocol , while high priority tasks are executed as soon as they are added to the list , low priority tasks wait for a long time until all high priority tasks are executed , i.e. , the instants of execution of low priority tasks are separated by long times of inactivity . using this assumption , it is numerically  @xcite ( analytically  @xcite ) shown that the distribution of inter - event times follows a power law .",
    "two interesting contributions were introduced by  @xcite .",
    "first the authors map the variable length priority model considered above onto a model of biased diffusion deriving asymptotic distributions for the inter - event times .",
    "second , in order to investigate the arising of power laws in more general situations , they generalize the fixed length model queue to contain tasks with a priority label and with a class label where there is always an active class and an inactive class . if the highest priority task of the inactive class exceeds that of the active class by at least a fixed switching cost , the inactive class becomes active and the active class becomes inactive .",
    "an interesting discussion is considered in  @xcite where it is argued that other mechanisms contribute for the distributions of waiting times such as deadlines , time dependence of priorities and the social context of the problem . in line with this debate ,",
    "@xcite relaxes the assumption that the priorities of tasks do not change over time and studies queueing systems where deadlines are assigned to the incoming tasks and the urgency to attend a task increases with time showing that only in the former model fat tails arise naturally as consequence of the scheduling rule .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the assumption that people execute tasks on a protocol that execute firstly the high priority item .",
    "in particular , we suppose that people assign priorities to the tasks on their lists in order to minimize some cost index , i.e. , a cost associated to the fact of not processing a given collection of tasks in a given time step .",
    "therefore , based on this assumption and inspired on  @xcite , we have built a discounted stochastic dynamic programming model with two types of tasks ( low and high priority tasks ) and a cost per stage for keeping a number of low and high priority tasks without processing .",
    "this is not the first time that a kind of optimization principle is used to understand the structure and dynamics of complex systems . in  @xcite , for instance , it is shown that complex networks may arise from optimization principles .",
    "it is also important to stress that although there is a large literature dealing with control of queue discipline  @xcite which this work is related , the model presented in this letter is neither an extension nor a particular case of any of these results .",
    "we have found that the type of protocol used to execute tasks is strongly dependent on the kind of instantaneous cost of keeping a task in the queue for an additional stage . when linear costs are used",
    "the protocol of executing preferentially the high priority costs always is the best solution .",
    "however , this does not happen when quadratic costs are considered . in this case",
    "different types of protocol are considered .",
    "furthermore , depending on the parameters of the system , the protocol considered generates complex one dimensional dynamics .",
    "we consider that there are two queues waiting for a service on a single server .",
    "let @xmath0 be the current cost of having state @xmath1 which is the state of the system , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the number of tasks in the first ( second ) queue .",
    "we say that the first queue is a low priority queue ( or the second queue is a high priority queue ) if @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that this is the case .",
    "the dynamics of these queues are modeled as follows : at each discrete time step with probability @xmath5 a new task arrives in the queue formed by high priority tasks and with probability @xmath6 a new task arrives in the queue formed by low priority tasks . within each of the queues the tasks",
    "are executed on a first - in , first - out basis . with probability",
    "@xmath7 the first task of the high priority queue is executed and with probability @xmath8 the first task of the low priority queue is executed .",
    "we assume here that @xmath9 is a state dependent control variable that the agent will choose in order to minimize the total cost function @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 $ ] is the expected value conditioned to the current state @xmath1 and the state control variable @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the discount factor .    due to the principle of optimality  @xcite and the banach fixed point theorem ,",
    "if the minimum cost function @xmath14}j_u(x_l , x_h)$ ] exists , it must be given by the unique solution of the bellman equation , that may be written as @xmath15}u(x_l , x_h)g(x_l , x_h)\\label{bellmanequation}\\ ] ] where @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\lambda   ( 1-\\rho )   ( 1-\\mu )   [ \\alpha j(x_l+1,x_h)]\\nonumber\\\\    & + & ( 1-\\lambda )   \\mu   [ \\alpha   j(x_l-1,x_h)]\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\rho   \\lambda   \\mu   [ \\alpha   j(x_l-1,x_h+1)]\\nonumber\\\\    & + & ( 1-\\rho )   \\lambda   \\mu   [ \\alpha   j(x_l , x_h)]\\nonumber\\\\    & + & ( 1-\\lambda )   ( 1-\\mu )   [ \\alpha   j(x_l , x_h ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\      & + &   \\rho   \\lambda   \\mu   [ \\alpha      ( j(x_l , x_h)-j(x_l-1,x_h+1))]\\nonumber\\\\      & + & ( 1-\\rho )   \\lambda   \\mu   [ \\alpha      ( j(x_l+1,x_h-1)-j(x_l , x_h ) ) ] \\label{eq : g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the optimization problem ( [ bellmanequation ] ) is a linear programming problem , the optimal control @xmath9 in each state @xmath1 will depend explicitly on the signal of @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 .",
    "finally , if @xmath23 , @xmath9 is a mixed strategy that may present any value in the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "it is quite intuitive this result .",
    "indeed , one may note that the terms in square brackets defined in @xmath18 , equation ( [ eq : g ] ) , comprises the variations in the cost function due to changes in the states of the queue related to the execution of one of the tasks .",
    "since the properties of the solution of @xmath25 of the bellman equation ( [ bellmanequation ] ) are strongly dependent on choice of the cost per stage @xmath0 , in the next sections , two different choices for @xmath0 are investigated .",
    "in this section , we assume that @xmath26 , for @xmath27 , i.e. , the current cost of having one additional high priority task in the queue is larger than having one additional low priority task in the queue .",
    "since the space of polynomials of degree 1 with sup - norm is a banach space , one can show inductively , making recursive iterations of the dynamic programming mapping , that @xmath25 is also linear .",
    "therefore , for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , guessing this form , one may easily solve the bellman equation ( [ bellmanequation ] ) and show that the cost function is given by , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ]",
    "@xmath32    furthermore , @xmath33 is always negative implying that @xmath34 for every state @xmath1 . therefore , if linear costs are considered , the protocol to be considered is the one based on the execution of the high priority task whenever there is at least one item in this queue , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "this kind of protocol was very well studied in  @xcite where analytic results for the emerging of power laws may be found . in the next section",
    ", a much wealthier situation happens where the optimal policy is not only limited to execute the high priority item in the queue , but the optimal policy is state - dependent .",
    "now , we assume that @xmath35 , for @xmath27 . following the same reasoning already presented before for the linear cost case",
    ", one may conclude a quadratic form for the cost function .    solving the bellman equation",
    ", one may show that the solution of the problem depends explicitly on the signal of the function @xmath18 , defined in ( [ eq : g ] ) , in the state @xmath1 .",

    "therefore , the dynamics takes place in the line passing by @xmath82 and following the direction @xmath83 .",
    "thus , if the expected state is in region @xmath37 it goes into the direction of region @xmath36 and viceversa .",

    "the dynamics defined in ( [ dynamics ] ) is topologically conjugate with the translation in the circle  @xcite .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that the stochastic process that defines the length of each queue is not stationary .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of the expected value of the length of the queue exhibits a complex behavior : infinitely many cycles or a @xmath97-limit set being a dense subset in the interval .",
    "the intuition behind that complex dynamics is quite reasonable . in the region close to the frontier",
    "@xmath98 that separate @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) , we can observe the following : if the expected state is in @xmath36 , its dynamics moves toward region b , since the priority is of @xmath99 .",
    "once the expected state is in @xmath37 , the dynamics takes it back to the region a , since in this case in average the priority is of @xmath100 ( due to the condition @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "because the frequency of tasks arriving is equal to that of attending them , a cyclical or complex dynamics emerges close to the referred frontier .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the case where this system is a limit cycle .",
    "a similar situation involving regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 arises in the case of @xmath79 and @xmath101 . in these situations ,",
    "the protocol is ruled by the protocols considered in regions @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the former case and by the protocols considered in regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the later case .",
    "for @xmath102 , either the expected value goes to infinite , converges to 0 , to axis @xmath103 or to axis @xmath104 , following different routes .",
    "furthermore , different kinds of protocols are possible .",
    "in the human dynamics of the tasks execution decisions the priority of one task is not always defined as being the most important current task .",
    "actually , the dynamics of the work executions depends on the cumulated tasks of short run priorities , the importance of each kind of task and the intertemporal discount factor . in this letter",
    ", we provide a stochastic dynamic programming model containing all those elements and analyze the dynamics of the execution of tasks , shedding new light to the discursion considered in  @xcite . in this setting",
    ", we have found that the dynamics of the expected state of the system may be complex , exhibiting cycles of any order or with limit set being a dense subset of the interval depending on the parameter values of the model .",
    "this is a contribution to a better understanding of how human dynamics may evolve in this type of problem .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that complex dynamics in the solution of dynamic programming problems are usually obtained for low discount factors  @xcite .",
