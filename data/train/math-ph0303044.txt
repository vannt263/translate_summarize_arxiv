    "the hamiltonian orbits are calculated numerically by a numerically stable self - consistent method that uses steepest - descent quenching and chooses only the nonrunaway orbits .    in 1903 , schwarzchild proposed a relativistic type of interaction between charges that was time reversible precisely because it involved retarded and advanced interactions symmetrically @xcite . the same model reappeared in the 1920s in the work of tetrode and fokker tetrode - fokker and it finally became an interesting physical theory after wheeler and feynman showed that this direct - interaction theory can describe all the classical electromagnetic phenomena ( i.e. the classical laws of coulomb , faraday , ampre , and biot - savart ) @xcite .",
    "another accomplishment was that wheeler and feynman showed in 1945 that in a certain limit where the electron practically interacts with a completely absorbing universe , the response of this universe to the electron s field is equivalent to the _ local _ lorentz - dirac self - interaction theory dirac without the need of mass renormalization @xcite .",
    "it is amusing to understand that the classical radiative phenomena of maxwell s electrodynamics can be described as a limiting case of  this direct - interaction theory ( complete absorption is added to the theory as a simple model to uncouple it from the detailed neutral - delay dynamics of the other charges of the universe ; for other limits see ref .",

    "it is important to stress that the converse of the above statement is not true at all : the complex _ conservative _ dynamics of the action - at - a - distance theory is not reducible to a limiting case of maxwell s electrodynamics ( which is always a dissipative theory because of the radiation ) .",
    "relativistic action - at - a - distance shares the conservative character with newtonian gravitation , and in the presence of a universe of particles , an atom described by the action - at - a - distance theory has the possibility to behave in a way analogous to the solar system in the newtonian sky :  distant solar masses being just small perturbations , as opposed to the description a la maxwell , where it _ has _ to radiate .",
    "it appears to us that the analysis of the complex conservative dynamics of wf2b is bound to reveal interesting new physical insights .",
    "as we have seen with this special case study , the physical nonrunaway condition performs the magical reduction from the infinite - dimensional dynamical system posed by the delay equation to a finite - dimensional one , and the large body of existing understanding on qualitative behavior of finite - dimensional vector fields should be applicable@xcite .",
    "some results already published for systems of atomic physics within the darwin approximation , a low - velocity hamiltonian approximation to action - at - a - distance , have already revealed interesting news@xcite .",
    "existing numerical methods for the relativistic case are still short reaching @xcite and can not reproduce the massive numerical search performed with the darwin approximation in @xcite .",
    "in this section we show that in the coulombian limit of a low - energy orbit , the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) and  ( [ lightcone ] )  has only two branches , one defined by @xmath93 and another defined by @xmath94 . because of time - reversal symmetry , the theorem is the same for either @xmath95 [ indicated by @xmath6 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) and ( [ lightcone ] ) ] or by @xmath236 [ indicated by @xmath5 in eqs .",

    "it suffices to prove that there is only one point where @xmath337 vanishes , with @xmath6 defined in eq .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) ) .",
    "a special version of this proof was given in ref .",
    "@xcite  along symmetric orbits of the equal - mass case .",
    "the proof is trivial and can be done for a generic orbit of the arbitrary - mass repulsive two - body system in the cmf : we start from the definition of the light - cone condition for a generic cmf orbit,@xmath338where @xmath339 represents the position of particle @xmath28 , assumed on the right , and @xmath340 represents the position of particle @xmath29 , assumed on the left , and we have set @xmath22 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ generalcone ] ) for symmetric orbits of the equal mass case [ @xmath341 ] .",
    "the key observation is that because the interaction is always repulsive , the velocity @xmath342 of particle @xmath28 is a monotonically _ increasing _ function of time ( particle @xmath28 is repulsed to the right ) , while the velocity @xmath343 of particle @xmath29 is a monotonically _ decreasing _ function of time ( particle @xmath29  is repelled to the left ) .",
    "if we take the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ generalcone ] ) respect to @xmath99 and isolate @xmath337 we obtain@xmath344for low - energy we have the bounds @xmath345 and @xmath346 ) is always positive . in the cmf",
    "the value of @xmath337 changes sign from the inbound asymptotic region to the outbound asymptotic region , with values onto the interval    @xmath347    to complete the proof we need only to notice that the sum of two monotonically increasing functions [ @xmath342 and @xmath348 ] is also monotonically increasing and , therefore , can only vanish once .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath348 is not necessarily a monotonically increasing function of @xmath99 for high - velocity orbits , as@xmath349which is the product of @xmath350 times a negative number [ recall that @xmath351 is a monotonically decreasing function of its argument and , therefore , @xmath352 is a monotonically increasing function ] .",
    "it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ monoeq ] ) guarantees that @xmath353 is an increasing function of @xmath99 if @xmath350 is positive , which is the case for a low - velocity orbit . a simple estimate for the first velocity where the twice - monotonic property can fail in the equal - mass case is given by setting @xmath354 in eq .",
    "( [ asymbounds ] ) , which predicts @xmath355 .",
    "in this appendix we exhibit a covariant derivation of the above hamiltonization procedure , which we develop only for the equal - mass case and with the hypothesis that the orbit is twice - monotonic ( proved in ref .",
    "driver1 for low energies and in appendix 1 for the arbitrary - mass case in the cmf ) .",
    "the definition of a covariant family starts from the observation that the lorentz transformation of a symmetric orbit has the property that the future of particle @xmath28 is the past of particle @xmath29 and vice versa .",
    "we define the relativistic symmetric family of orbits , henceforth called rsf , as the family of orbits with the property that _ _  if _ _ @xmath356 , then it follows that @xmath357 .",
    "it is easy to verify that rsf is a lorentz invariant family of orbits and also that any lorentz transformation of a symmetric orbit belongs to rsf ( but , in principle , these should not exhaust the rsf : there could be other types of orbits ) . a generic orbit of the rsf",
    "is represented in fig .",
    "7 , where we illustrate the time - reversal and exchange symmetry .",
    "the above definition implies that the future of particle @xmath28 is the past of particle @xmath29 in the rsf . inside the rsf , by use of the time - reversal operation @xmath358 , @xmath359",
    ", we can prove the same identities ( [ defphi ] ) , ( [ defv ] ) and an equivalent form of eq . ( [ defab ] ) , relating particle @xmath28 to particle @xmath29 , ( only that in case @xmath41 the role of @xmath360 and @xmath151 is exchanged ) , and these in turn lead to the same type of general ghost lagrangian to describe a twice - monotonic orbit .",
    "the relativistic condition that the future of one particle is the past of the other implies that the solution of wf2b inside the rsf must have the following branch correspondences : @xmath361 and @xmath362 ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "these conditions can be seen with the help of ( [ tablea ] ) and ( [ tableb ] ) to be equivalent to the four conditions @xmath363the above conditions imply that the orbit is defined by four different functions @xmath364 @xmath365 and @xmath366 [ see definition ( [ defifs-1 ] ) and ( [ defifs-2 ] ) ] .",
    "to verify that condition ( [ condi0 ] ) is relativistically invariant , let us suppose that we tried to describe the orbit from another lorentz frame , with boost parameter @xmath367 .",
    "if the orbit is twice - monotonic , it can be described in case @xmath37 with a lagrangian @xmath368 of the same type of ( [ lagrangian - a ] ) , and a hamiltonian of type ( [ hamia ] ) , and the new coordinates @xmath369 @xmath370 must be obtained by a simple lorentz transformation with boost parameter @xmath371 imposing this condition on the explicit solution ( [ tablea ] ) , and noticing that the advanced light - cone distance in the new frame relates to the old one by @xmath372 we obtain @xmath373which , besides showing that eq . ( [ condi0 ] )",
    "is frame independent , also shows that @xmath374 as defined by eq .",
    "( [ defifs-1 ] ) is a lorentz scalar : @xmath375and that @xmath329 [ as defined by eq .",
    "( [ defifs-2 ] ) ] transforms like @xmath376with @xmath377 case @xmath41 transforms in the same way with @xmath378 this last equation allows us to express the hamiltonian in any frame by use of the cmf form of @xmath246 and a rescaling depending on the boost parameter , which can be determined by asymptotic data .",
    "last we show that the action of a lorentz transformation on hamiltonian ( hamia ) is a canonical transformation : it is easy to verify with the help of eq .",
    "( [ defining ]  ) that a lorentz transformation simply rescales the coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath39 to @xmath379and @xmath380 with @xmath381 @xmath382 to complete the change with a canonical transformation one must scale the momenta with the inverse factor , @xmath383 and @xmath384 by this canonical transformation the transformed hamiltonian is @xmath385where  @xmath386 , @xmath387 , @xmath388 , and @xmath389 .",
    "notice that hamiltonian @xmath390 picked a multiplicative factor of @xmath381 and if we also perform a change to the natural evolution parameter @xmath391 of the new lorentz frame , it compensates exactly for that factor , going back to the form ( hamia ) , the same form for all lorentz frames .",
