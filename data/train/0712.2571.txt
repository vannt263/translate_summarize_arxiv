    "is the possibility to study ultracold atoms under the influence of strong artificial abelian and non - abelian  magnetic \" fields . the experimental realization of artificial abelian  magnetic \" fields , which reproduce the physics of electrons in strong magnetic fields , is currently achieved through diverse schemes : for atoms in a trap the simplest way is to rotate the trap @xcite , while for atoms in optical lattices",
    "this can be accomplished by combining laser - assisted tunneling and lattice acceleration methods @xcite , by the means of lattice rotations @xcite , or by the immersion of atoms in a lattice within a rotating bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "several phenomena were predicted to occur in these arrangements such as the hofstadter ",
    "butterfly \" @xcite and the  escher staircase \" @xcite in single - particle spectra , vortex formation @xcite , quantum hall effects @xcite , as well as other quantum correlated liquids @xcite .    as shown by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is simple to generalize the scheme of jaksch and zoller for generating artificial abelian  magnetic \" fields @xcite in order to mimic artificial non - abelian  magnetic \" fields .",
    "to this aim we have to consider atoms with more internal states (  flavors \" ) .",
    "the gauge potentials that can be realized using standard manipulations , such as laser - assisted tunneling and lattice acceleration , can have practically arbitrary matrix form in the space of  flavors \" .",
    "in such non - abelian potentials , the single - particle spectrum generally depicts a complex structure termed by one of us hofstadter",
    " moth \" @xcite , which is characterized by numerous extremely small gaps .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite has stimulated further investigations , including studies of nontrivial quantum transport properties @xcite , as well as studies of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) for cold atoms @xcite , spatial patterns in optical lattices @xcite , modifications of the landau levels @xcite , and quantum atom optics @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that the @xmath0 gauge potentials proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in most of the following works are characterized by _ non - constant _ wilson loops : atoms performing a loop around a plaquette undergo a unitary transformation which depends linearly on one of the spatial coordinates .",
    "although such gauge potentials are interesting _ per se _ , the features characterizing the hofstadter  moth \" result from this _ linear spatial dependence _ of the wilson loop , rather than from their non - abelian nature . indeed , the hofstadter  moth \"-",
    "like spectrum may actually be found in the standard abelian case with a wilson loop proportional to @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    two of us have shown that cold fermionic atoms trapped in optical lattices and subjected to artificial  magnetic \" fields should exhibit an iqhe @xcite . if a static force is applied to atoms , for instance by accelerating the lattice ,",
    "the transverse hall conductivity gives the relation between this external forcing and the transverse atomic current through the lattice .",
    "it has been shown that this transverse conductivity is quantized , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer and @xmath4 is planck s constant .",
    "note that this quantity can be easily measured from density profiles , as shown recently by umucalilar _",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "the quantization of @xmath5 occurs , however , only if the fermi energy of the system is located inside a gap of the single - particle spectrum . while the observation of the iqhe seems to be experimentally feasible in abelian",
    " magnetic \" fields , it is hardly so in the deeply non - abelian regime in which the gaps of the  moth \" become very small @xcite .",
    "the question therefore arises whether the consideration of non - abelian gauge potentials characterized by a _",
    "constant _ wilson loop could stabilize the spectral gaps and guarantee the robustness of the iqhe in ultracold fermionic gases and whether an anomalous iqhe , as observed in graphene , can exist in such systems .    in this work we provide affirmative answers to these questions by considering the iqhe in a system that features a non - abelian gauge potential characterized by specific non - commutating constant components and by a _",
    "constant _ wilson loop .",
    "we calculate the energy spectrum and we obtain a robust band structure with well developed gaps , which differs drastically from the case of the gauge potential of ref . @xcite . in particular , we note the existence of van hove singularities in the density of states and we obtain their analytical expression .",
    "we then evaluate the conductivity @xmath6 for neutral currents using topological methods : we express @xmath6 in terms of the topologically invariant chern numbers associated to each energy band @xcite .",
    "we eventually present a salient fractal phase diagram which represents the integer values of the transverse conductivity inside the infinitely many gaps of the spectrum . in this way",
    ", we show that the iqhe survives in the non - abelian regime , but undergoes strong modifications with striking similarity to the anomalous iqhe in graphene @xcite : the transverse conductivity suddenly changes sign due to the presence of van hove singularities and is , under certain conditions , anomalous because of conical energy spectra .",
    "we consider a system of non - interacting two - component fermionic atoms trapped in a 2d optical square lattice of unit length @xmath7 , with sites at @xmath8 , with @xmath9 integers .",
    "the non - interacting limit can be reached using feshbach resonances , or simply at low densities .",
    "the optical potential is strong , so that the tight - binding approximation holds .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a single particle subjected to an artificial gauge potential then reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) is the tunneling operator and @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) is the tunneling amplitude in the @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) direction . in the following ,",
    "we use @xmath7 as the length , and @xmath16 as the energy units , and set @xmath17 , except otherwise stated .",
    "the tunneling operators are related to the gauge potential according to @xmath18 .",
    "here we consider a general non - abelian gauge potential @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are pauli matrices and @xmath24 is the number of abelian magnetic flux quanta per unit cell .    in order to realize such a potential we may consider the method of ref .",
    "however , the specific form of this gauge potential allows us to consider an even more practical scheme based on a generalization of the method currently developed by klein and jaksch @xcite .",
    "we may use @xmath25k atoms in @xmath26 or @xmath27 hyperfine manifolds , or @xmath28li with @xmath29 . for",
    "@xmath25k one should optically pump and restrict the atomic dynamics to the two lowest zeeman sublevels in each of the hyperfine manifolds .",
    "one can then employ different lattice tiltings in the @xmath1 and @xmath15 directions to perform laser ( raman assisted ) tunnelings that change the internal states of the atoms ; this allows to control the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and fixes the tunneling rate .",
    "finally , the immersion of the system in a rotating bec will allow to control @xmath24 @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "one routinely reaches the values of ( laser assisted , or direct ) tunneling rates in the range of 5 - 10 khz ( @xmath30 0.5 @xmath31k ) , fermi temperatures of the same order , and temperatures @xmath32 0.2 @xmath33 50 - 100 nk ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    ", one observes that conical intersections are preserved in the energy spectrum .",
    "as shown in the next section , the particles behave similarly to dirac particles in this non - abelian region and the system exhibits an anomalous quantum hall effect .",
    "we eventually note that when the flux @xmath82 , the density of states reveals several van hove singularities at the energies @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 . as the flux increases , these singularities evolve and generally merge .",

    "such bundles are conceived as the product of the parameter space @xmath92 with the non - abelian gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "this product space , which is supposed to be locally trivial but is generally expected to twist globally , is characterized by the non - abelian berry s curvature =( _",
    "k_x ^y-_k_y ^x + [ ^x , ^y ] ) dk_x dk_y , where @xmath95 is the berry s connection",
    ". the triviality of the fibre bundle is measured by the chern number c(e_)= _ ^2 tr , which is a topological invariant and is necessarily an integer .",
    "note that each band @xmath90 is associated to a specific fibre bundle , on which a chern number is defined .",

    "this computation can be achieved numerically thanks to an efficient method developed by fukui _",
    "_ @xcite and which can be applied to our specific system .",

    "the chern numbers associated to the six bands are respectively @xmath107 . according to eq . , the transverse conductivity s values associated to the 5 gaps are @xmath108 as shown in fig .",
    "[ bandfig ] .",
    "the phase diagram describing the iqhe for our model can eventually be drawn . in this diagram",
    "we represent the quantized transverse conductivity as a function of the fermi energy @xmath93 and flux @xmath24 . here",
    "we illustrate a representative example of such a phase diagram which was obtained for @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( cf .",
    "[ one ] ) .",
    "this striking figure differs radically from the phase diagrams obtained by osadchy and avron in the abelian case @xcite since the chern numbers associated to the gaps are no longer satisfying a simple diophantine equation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the measurement of the transverse conductivity in this system should show a specific sequence of robust plateaus , heralding a new type of quantum hall effect .",
    "this new effect is comparable to the iqhe observed in si - mosfet or the anomalous iqhe observed in graphene in the  low flux \" regime @xmath111 corresponding to experimentally available magnetic fields . in this regime ,",

    "the iqhe survives in the deeply non - abelian regime and acquires a unique character specific to the non - abelian nature of the gauge fields .",
