    "recently , two laboratories have demonstrated that it is possible to diffract beams of fast - moving atoms and molecules from ordered surfaces under conditions of grazing incident angles , a method that has been given the name grazing incidence fast atom diffraction ( gifad ) .",
    "@xcite the range of energies goes from several hundred ev up to tens of kev for the projectiles used which include he , h atoms and h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the target surfaces were single - crystal alkali halides .",
    "these energies correspond to de broglie wavelengths several orders of magnitude smaller than the lattice spacing of the target crystal . because of the long travel path near the surface one might expect sufficient dephasing to occur which would destroy all quantum coherence , and furthermore a simple application of the debye - waller attenuation due to thermal roughness of the surface",
    "would imply totally negligible diffraction intensities except possibly for the most grazing incidence conditions .",
    "however , when the incident beam was aligned along a high symmetry direction intense and clearly measurable diffraction peak signals were observed in the direction normal to the scattering plane .",
    "two different theoretical groups have carried out numerical simulations of the diffraction process using propagation of wave packet techniques and have shown that one can obtain a reasonable description of the scattering intensities as functions of the initial beam parameters such as energy and incident angle .",
    "@xcite these descriptions indicate that along the fast velocity component of the incident beam the interaction potential of the surface is averaged so that the total potential appears as if it were relatively smooth with one - dimensional corrugations in the high symmetry direction .",
    "also , it has been shown that simple calculations of diffraction intensities based on the eikonal approximation for a one - dimensional repulsive hard wall potential can predict the diffraction intensities reasonably well .",
    "@xcite    in this paper a theory is developed starting from semiclassical quantum mechanics that produces analytical expressions which describe the scattering process at levels of coherence ranging from purely quantum mechanical diffraction to the fully incoherent classical limit .",
    "the basic starting approximations are the eikonal approximation and assumption of a target crystal whose thermal vibrations are in the harmonic limit .",
    "the scattering process is described as a series of sequential collisions along the path of the projectile as it moves near the crystal . under these conditions",
    "very little energy is lost due to motion in the fast direction parallel to the surface and it is shown that the debye - waller factor becomes sufficiently large to permit measurable diffraction intensities . under conditions where quantum peaks are observed the very small energy loss associated with the fast direction ensures that the dephasing is sufficiently weak to permit quantum scattering in the other two mutually perpendicular directions .",
    "in addition to the purely quantum diffraction limit the theory can be taken to the classical limit through use of the bohr correspondence principle . in between the clearly distinct quantum and classical limits",
    "there is a regime where the dephasing allows for distinct quantum peak features that are broadened by a limited coherence length and these quantum diffraction features do not obey debye - waller attenuation .",
    "each of these regimes has its own signature characteristics that should be measurable in the energy , angular and temperature dependence of the measurements .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "the theory is developed together with a description of the various possible quantum mechanical and classical limits in the following section  [ theory ] . in sec .",

    "an appropriate starting point for developing the theory of scattering of atomic projectiles from a surface is the quantum mechanical transition rate for a particle of incident wave vector @xmath1 making a transition to the final state of wave vector @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transition matrix element taken with respect to the final and initial states of the system of projectile plus target , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the initial and final global energies of the entire system .",
    "the angular brackets indicate an average over all initial states of the surface target and the @xmath7 indicates a sum over all final states of the target .",
    "the usual procedure is to write the energy delta - function as its time - integral fourier representation and to shift to the interaction picture in which the time dependence is governed by the target hamiltonian  @xcite , a process that is sometimes called the glauber - van hove transformation  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the final and initial translational energies of the projectile atom .",
    "the fast atom diffraction experiment is one in which one component of the incident momentum , chosen as @xmath11 , is much larger than the component in the direction normal to the surface which is chosen to be the @xmath12-direction .",
    "thus , it will be a reasonable approximation to assume that the transition operator separates into the product of an operator in the normal direction and an operator in the directions parallel to the surface @xmath13 the matrix element of the transition operator , taken with respect to final and initial states of the projectile , then separates into the product @xmath14 the squared normal transition operator @xmath15 is proportional to the probability of making a transition from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "there are two useful limits in which this can be evaluated exactly .",
    "the first is the nearly trivial case of a surface whose potential is a rigid hard repulsive wall in which case it is a constant .",
    "this is the evaluation used in the standard application of the eikonal approximation for elastic scattering .",
    "@xcite the other useful limit is given by the classical motion of a grazing - angle projectile moving in a one - dimensional exponentially repulsive potential such as @xmath18 if the atoms of the surface are subject to small random displacements about their equilibrium positions the scattered distribution becomes a lognormal distribution in the final angle  @xcite as shown below in appendix  [ lognorm ] : @xmath19 ^ 2 \\right\\ } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the mean square displacement .",
    "the origin of the surface displacement is thermal motion , although the displacement appears static to the fast - moving projectiles because the collision times are much shorter than typical phonon periods .",
    "thus @xmath20 is given by the mean square thermal displacement normal to the surface , which in the high temperature limit for a debye model of the phonon density of states is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath23 is the surface temperature , @xmath24 is the surface mass and @xmath25 is the surface debye temperature .",

    "however , the widths of the streaks in the @xmath17-direction increases in proportion to @xmath165 .",
    "this increase in width comes from the lognormal distribution in eq .",

    "the relative intensities of the diffraction features associated with different @xmath191 reciprocal lattice vectors , as well as the relative intensity within the streak of the diffraction feature due to a single given @xmath191 , is governed by the corrugation landscape of the potential as expressed in the transition matrix amplitudes @xmath194 of eq .",
    "( [ glauber8 ] ) .",
    "for example , the corrugation of the surface can produce rainbow effects and supernumerary rainbow effects in the diffraction peak distributions , as has been recently reported  @xcite .",
    "intensity modulation due to the shape of the potential can also be observed within the streak of a single diffraction feature and such effects can cause the streak to appear `` shifted '' above or below its expected position on the laue circle , as is apparent in the observations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above responses of the diffraction features to the controllable experimental variables , it is of interest to discuss several possibilities that might be open for future experimental investigation .",
    "the first of these is the unlikely possibility of observing quantum diffraction effects in the high velocity direction , due to reciprocal lattice vectors in the @xmath121-direction .",
    "it is of interest to note the reasons why this is unlikely . for the case of positive @xmath121 ( meaning",

    "the value of @xmath17 becomes sufficiently large that the diffraction features are projected several degrees in polar angle above the specular position .",
    "this means that these peaks would also be unobservable because a flat ordered surface can not scatter intensity into such large scattering angles .",
    "a possible effect closely related to supernumerary rainbows is the observation of quantum interference due to scattering of terraces at different atomic height intervals on the surface as seen in thermal energy he atom diffraction  @xcite and in reflection high energy electron diffraction  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon should also manifest itself in the present fast atom diffraction - type experiments , although the effect may be limited by the relatively short coherence length of the experiment .",
    "an effect observed very early in the history of he atom diffraction at thermal energies was the observation of selective adsorption , or resonances with the bound states of the potential  @xcite . in principle",
    "these resonances , which are characterized by sharp increases or decreases in diffraction peak intensities as an experimentally controllable parameter is varied through resonance conditions , should be present in the current experiments .",
    "the simplest statement of the condition for selective adsorption resonance is that the value of @xmath195 must be negative ( corresponding to an evanescent beam ) and nearly equal to the energy of a bound state of the potential . in the present experiments , the simplest way to look for",
    "selection adsorption events would be by slightly varying the incident azimuthal angle @xmath196 away from a high symmetry direction .",
    "when the incident beam is aligned along a high symmetry direction with @xmath197 the diffraction features observed on the channel plate detector lie roughly along the laue circle of eq .",
    "( [ circ2 ] ) which appears symmetric with respect to the specular spot . however , if @xmath196 deviates slightly from zero , for example upon a small azimuthal rotation of the target crystal , the observed laue circle becomes skewed and asymmetric . along with this asymmetric",
    "shifting of the laue circle , many of the low - index diffraction features will become evanescent and have @xmath17 values that pass through conditions for resonance .",
    "one of the most important uses of thermal energy he atom diffraction has been the measurement of single phonon transfers and surface phonon dispersion relations . because of the large disparities of energy between that of typical phonons and the kinetic energies used in theses experiments it is unlikely that most single surface phonon inelastic events will be measurable . however , it is worth mentioning that there is one type of inelastic process that could be measured by these experiments , and this would be energy exchange with dispersionless excitations , e.g. , surface phonons , surface plasmons , surface polaritons , etc . whose energies do not depend on momentum transfer parallel to the surface . for example",
    ", diffraction should still be observable even in the event that the atomic projectiles exchange one or more dispersionless inelastic quanta because such processes would not destroy the quantum coherence of the system .",
    "this case is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ spa ] and is analogous to kikuchi lines observed in rheed due to simultaneous multiple phonon transfer and diffraction .",
    "the diffraction features appear similar to those due to two - dimensional diffraction described in the above section , except that there is no debye - waller factor and there is temperature dependent broadening in both the @xmath17 and @xmath106 directions .",
    "this type of diffraction could appear under conditions where the 2-d quantum behavior of the above section has negligible intensity , or the two can appear simultaneously as shown in the calculations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the expression for the transition rate",
    "is given in eq .",
    "( [ glauber12 ] ) and the major difference with the 2-d diffraction case of eq .",
    "( [ glauber8 ] ) is that the product of the debye - waller factor and the discrete delta - function dependence in parallel momentum transfer have been replaced by a periodic density of states consisting of broader peaks .",
    "the physical reason for these differences is the fact that multiple phonon quanta are transferred in this case , and the spatial region of coherence from which an interference diffraction pattern is built is no longer infinitely large , but becomes finite in extent .",
    "the diffraction features are still manifest as relatively long streaks in the @xmath17-direction whose length is governed by the lognormal distribution and these streaks appear aligned roughly along the laue circle . in the @xmath106-direction",

    "the appearance of this background intensity is a feature broadened in the @xmath17-direction by the lognormal distribution , and broad in the @xmath106-direction according to the extent permitted by the associated classical scattering form factor @xmath199 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the maximum of this background intensity varies approximately inversely with the surface temperature , while the fwhm is proportional to @xmath165 . because the peak width in the polar angle @xmath187 is governed mainly by the lognormal function , this width is only weakly dependent on incident energy .",
    "the peak intensity also is inversely proportional to @xmath200 , while the fwhm is directly proportional to this same quantity .",
    "the total energy loss is evaluated in appendix  [ expo ] in the classical limit of large incident energy and high temperatures and is given by @xmath201 .",
    "this energy loss , for the present grazing - angle geometry with small @xmath124 is negligible and roughly five orders of magnitude smaller than the incident energy .",
    "most of this energy loss can be ascribed to motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface , and it can be readily shown that the the fraction of energy that can be ascribed to diminishing the fast @xmath202 component of momentum is smaller than the above @xmath98 by a factor proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "it is of interest to note that @xmath98 is proportional to the range parameter of the repulsive exponential potential , implying that measurement of the energy losses over a range of incident energies , or when combined with measurements of intensity and fwhm dependence , may provide a means to measure this important physical parameter .",
    "the other , and radically different , type of background expected to be measured in high energy atomic scattering experiments is that due to binary collisions with topological defects such as adatoms or step edges on the surface .",
