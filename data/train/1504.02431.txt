    "the prediction through the sneia hubble diagram [ 1,2 ] that the universe is at present going through on accelerating phase , has been confirmed by wide range of data , from more recent sneia data to baos and cmbr anisotropies [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "however , the overwhelming abundance of observational evidences for cosmic speed up does not match with standard cosmology in the frame work of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "to resolve this paradox , an unexpected new ingredient in the form of a negative pressured component has been introduced but it poses difficult questions on its nature and introduces further problems hard to be solved .",
    "so it is naturally speculated that these observational evidences may be the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravity on cosmological scale . as a result",
    "several modified gravity theories has been developed of which @xmath2-gravity theory[8,9 ] gets much attention . in this theory",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath3 is replaced by a suitably chosen function @xmath4 in the gravity lagrangian . + an equivalent formulation is represented by teleparallelism where instead of curvature , torsion is responsible for the gravitational interaction [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "this model was first proposed by einstein for unifying electromagnetism and gravity on weitzenbck non - riemannian manifold .",
    "the weitzenbck connection replaces the levi - civita one on the underlying riemann - cartan space - time .",
    "thus gravitational interaction is not purely geometrical rather , the torsion acts as a force , allowing the interpretation of gravity as a gauge theory of the translation group[13 ] .",
    "although , conceptually , gr and teleparallel gravity are distinct but they yield equivalent dynamics at least at the classical level . + in analogy with @xmath2-gravity , a generalization to teleparallel gravity is obtained by replacing @xmath1 ( the torsion scalar ) with a generic function @xmath5 .",
    "a particular important consequence is the breakdown of the equivalence with the classical gr and hence predicts different dynamics [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "further , modified teleparallel gravity preserves the field equations to be still second order in the field derivatives in contrast to fourth order equations in @xmath4-gravity",
    ". however , this modified theory suffers from the lack of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , hence all the sixteen components of the vierbien are independent and one can not fix six of them by a gauge choice[17 ] .    for the past few years , models based on de interacting with dark matter ( dm ) or any other exotic matter components have gained great impetus .",
    "such interacting de models can successfully explain numerous cosmological puzzles namely , phantom crossing , cosmic coincidence and cosmic age problem [ 18 - 23 ] .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of dynamics of interacting dark energy in @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "the interaction between de and dm could be a major issue to be confronted in studying the physics of de .",
    "however , due to the nature of these two components remaining unknown , it will not be possible to derive the precise form of the interaction from first principles .",
    "one has to assume a specific coupling from the outset or determine it from phenomenological requirements .",
    "further , in the framework of field theory it is natural to consider the inevitable interaction between the dark components .",
    "an appropriate interaction between de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "moreover , complementary observational signatures of the interaction between de and dm have been obtained from the cosmic expansion history by using wmap , snia , bao and sdss data as well as the growth of cosmic structure .",
    "interestingly , it was disclosed that the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect has the unique ability to provide insight into the coupling between the dark sectors .",
    "further , in view of the continuity equations , the interaction between de and dm must be a function of the energy densities multiplied by a quantity with units of the inverse of time which has the natural choice as hubble parameter .",
    "usually one assumes a phenomenological form of interaction between matter and dark energy which are the dominant components of the cosmic composition [ 24 - 28 ] today .",
    "in fact , the interaction term gives the rate of exchange of energy density in the dark sector .",
    "the motivation for choosing such a complex system is to test of such a weird model could explain the overall cosmological evolution .",
    "due to complicated field equations , we study the dynamics in the phase space associated to this scenario around both hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic critical points . considering first order perturbations near the critical points , we examine the nature of critical points by considering the eigenvalues of first order perturbed matrix .",
    "previously , similar dynamical system analysis has been done by us in dirac - born - infeld gravity theory [ 29 ] and in brane scenario [ 30 ] . in dbi model ,",
    "critical points are evaluated , analyzed and their stability have been discussed . in brane gravity model which is essentially on higher dimensional theory , in addition to the above analysis the classical stability of the model itself has been examined . in the present @xmath5 gravity model , choosing the function @xmath6 appropriately the evolution equations are converted to an autonomous system by suitable choice of the auxiliary variables .",
    "in addition to the above course of analysis in the present work we shall also examine the stability of the system both classically as well as quantum mechanically .",
    "we follow the plan : in section ii , we present the basic theory of @xmath0 gravity . in section iii , we introduce the basic equations and formation of dynamical system . while the critical points of the dynamical system and phase space analysis to the corresponding critical points are shown in section iv . in section",
    "v and vi , we work out the stability analysis of the critical points . the cosmological implications at the critical points are discussed in section vii .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section viii . throughout the paper we use natural units ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a possible way to modify gravity beyond general relativity is to consider the weitzenbck connection , which has no curvature but torsion , rather than the curvature defined by the levi - civita connection .",
    "such an approach is termed as teleparallelism[12,31 - 33 ] , which was also considered by einstein himself[10,11 ] . however , in the context of the present accelerated expansion of the universe , the teleparallel lagrangian density described by the torsion scalar @xmath1 has been extended to a function of @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) [ 34,35 ] , equivalent to the concept of @xmath4 gravity .    in this new modified gravity theory ( called @xmath0-gravity ) , the gravity is no longer caused by curved space - time but torsion and moreover , the field equations are only second order unlike the fourth order equations in the @xmath4 theory .    in @xmath0 gravity theory",
    "the action is written as @xmath9\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the torsion scalar , @xmath5 is a differentiable function of the torsion , @xmath10 corresponds to the matter lagrangian , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the torsion scalar is defined as @xmath13 with @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    in teleparallelism , orthogonal tetrad components @xmath17 are used as dynamical objects and are cosidered as an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point @xmath18 of the manifold .",
    "so we have @xmath19 . here",
    "each vector @xmath20 can be described by its components @xmath21 , @xmath22 = 0,1,2,3 ( @xmath23 = 0,1,2,3 ) in a coordinate basis i.e. @xmath24 . here",
    "capital letters refer to the tangent space while greek indices label coordinates on the manifold .",
    "the metric tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as @xmath25 in the above @xmath26 is the curvature less weitzenbck connection and it encompasses all the information about the gravitational field .",
    "the contorsion tensor @xmath27 gives the difference between weitzenbck and levi - civita connections .",
    "it is straight forward to show that this equation of motion reduces to einstein gravity when @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , it is the equivalency between the teleparallel theory and einstein gravity [ 12 ] . the theory has been found to address the issue of cosmic acceleration in the early and late evolution of universe [ 36 ] but this crucially depends on the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , exponential or power - law form of @xmath0 can not lead to phantom crossing [ 37 ] .",
    "but subsequently , it has been shown that crossing of the phantom divide line for the effective equation of state of two specific models in @xmath0 gravity is possible[38 ] and the best fit results suggest that the observations favour a crossing of the phantom barrier",
    ". then reconstruction of @xmath0 models has been reported in [ 39,40 ] while a detailed cosmological analysis is performed in [ 41,42 ] and thermodynamics of @xmath0 cosmology [ 43 ] including the generalized 2nd law of thermodynamics has been investigated .",
    "+ further , it should be noted that a constant @xmath0 acts like as a cosmological constant while @xmath6 linear in @xmath1 ( i.e @xmath29 ) is simply a redefinition of newton s constant @xmath30 .",
    "a desirable choice of @xmath0 is such that at high redshift general relativity should hold so as to agree with primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background constraints i.e @xmath31 at early times ( @xmath32 ) [ 44 ] .",
    "on the other hand , in the asymptotic future there will be de sitter state .",
    "a simplest choice of @xmath6 is the polynomial form [ 44 ]    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is arbitrary constant .    in particular for @xmath35 the model gives the same expansion history as dgp gravity [ 44,45 ] and hence @xmath0 gravity can be considered to be related to higher dimension theories .",
    "note that the restriction @xmath36 gives @xmath0 a viable model compared to current observed data set and also puts the rescale factor @xmath37 to newton s constant to be small .",
    "the effective de equation of state varies from @xmath38 in the past to @xmath39 in the future .    throughout the work we consider the flat homogeneous and isotropic frw universe with the metric @xmath40 where t is cosmic time . for this metric    @xmath41 where @xmath42 is cosmological scale factor . by combining with ( 5 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 )",
    "one obtains    @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hubble parameter and dot stands for derivative with respect to t. +",
    "in @xmath8 gravity theory , we consider flat , homogeneous and isotropic frw space - time as the model of our universe and the matter is chosen as dark matter in the form of dust(having energy density @xmath45 ) interacting with the dark energy which is chosen as a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath46 having self interacting potential @xmath47 .",
    "so the energy density and pressure corresponding to this scalar field are @xmath48 thus the modified friedmann equations in @xmath8- gravity are[14,15 ]    @xmath49\\ ] ]    @xmath50\\ ] ]    the energy balance equations for the individual dark components are @xmath51 and    @xmath52    where the interaction term @xmath53 corresponds to energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the positivity of @xmath54 indicates a transfer of energy from dark energy to dark matter .",
    "this is required to alleviate the coincidence problem and is compatible with the 2nd .",
    "law of thermodynamics .",
    "for the time being @xmath54 is unspecified , only it is assumed that @xmath54 does not change sign during the cosmic evolution . due to the unknown nature of the two dark components",
    "( dm and de ) , the precise form of the interaction can not be determined from the outset or from phenomenological requirements .",
    "however , it is speculated that the interaction term may lead to a major issue to be confronted in studying the physics of de .",
    "also , from the view point of field theory , interaction between the dark components appears naturally .",
    "moreover , an appropriate interaction between the de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "further , in view of the continuity equations ( i.e. equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) ) the interaction between de and dm should be a function of energy densities multiplied by a factor having dimension inverse of time and hubble parameter is a natural choice for it .",
    "thus phenomenologically , @xmath54 can be chosen as ( i ) @xmath55 , ( ii ) @xmath56 , ( iii ) @xmath57 $ ] or more generally ( iv ) @xmath58 . in the present work , for simplicity @xmath54",
    "is chosen as @xmath59 , where the coupling parameter @xmath60 is assumed to be small .",
    "now , using ( 9 ) in the continuity equation ( 13 ) the evolution of the scalar field is given by    @xmath61    ( the modified klein - gordon equations ) + due to complicated form of the evolution equations , it is not possible to have analytic solution so to have a qualitative idea about the cosmological behavior we shall put the evolution equations into an autonomous dynamical system . for this , we introduce the new variables    @xmath62    which are normalized over hubble scale .",
    "@xmath63 is the density parameter for dm . as a result",
    ", the evolution equations reduce to the following autonomous system of ordinary differential equations ( after some algebra ) +   + @xmath64 @xmath65\\ ] ] @xmath66\\\\\\ ] ]    where we choose @xmath67 , a constant such that @xmath68 and the independent variable is chosen as @xmath69 , which is called the e - folding parameter . the system of equations in ( 16 )",
    "is analyzed by first equating them to zero to obtain the critical points .",
    "next we perturb equations up to first order about the critical points and check their stability . + in deriving the above autonomous system of ode we choose @xmath70 ( i.e @xmath71 in equation ( 7 ) ) and",
    "the interaction is chosen in the form @xmath72 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the positive coupling is very reassuring in view of coincidence problem .",
    "however , models with negative coupling parameter ( indicates decay of dm into de ) allow for the possibility that there is no de field in the very early universe and that de condenses as result of the slow decay of dm [ 46 ] .",
    "also , it has been shown [ 47 ] that the coupling parameter is weakly constrained to negative values by planck measurements .",
    "further , the negative coupling can not be counted to resolve the tension between the planck and hst measurements of the hubble parameter [ 47 ] .",
    "although , the negative coupling does not help to alleviate the coincidence problem , it appears in the observed data fittings that models with negative coupling shows most significant departure from zero coupling .",
    "further , using the normalized variables in the first modified friedmann equation , we obtain the density parameter for the dark matter as @xmath73 due to the energy condition @xmath74 , so for fix @xmath63 , @xmath75 lies on the circle @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , the phase space @xmath77 of the autonomous system ( 16 ) forms a paraboloid ( @xmath78 ) bounded by @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hence the phase space is finite .",
    "the cosmological parameters related to the scalar field namely the equation of state parameter @xmath81 and the density parameter @xmath82 can be expressed by newly defined variables as @xmath83 and @xmath84 since @xmath78 .",
    "also , the deceleration parameter has the explicit form : @xmath85    and the equation of state parameter of the equivalent geometric matter is    @xmath86",
    "we analyze the stability of the corresponding dynamical system about the critical points .",
    "we shall plot the phase and evolutionary diagrams accordingly . for this reason we must find the critical points of the system of equations ( 16 ) forming an autonomous dynamical system and",
    "then we linearize the system near the critical points .",
    "the system of equations ( 16 ) has the following six critical points for the positive coupling parameter @xmath87 i.e. decaying of de into matter : + @xmath88 i. critical points : @xmath89 , + @xmath88 ii .",

    "also , these two critical points represent solutions without matter part of the universe .",

    "these two critical points are stable solutions if @xmath106 . also , they behave like attractor solutions for @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath108 ) .",

    "these solutions are dominated by de components only for @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 correspond to solutions in accelerating or decelerating phase of universe according as @xmath114 .",
    "now , in the table iv , for negative coupling parameter , we get two critical points namely @xmath115 and @xmath116 which are non - hyperbolic in nature . the solutions are saddle like ( because one eigenvalue is always positive in both of the cases ) due to instability in the eigen direction associated with positive eigenvalue and the stability of an eigen direction associated to a negative eigenvalue .",

    "+ further , we have investigated the classical as well as quantum stability of the model .",
    "note that these two types of stability are not interrelated because the stability of the critical point is related to the perturbations @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( the corresponding variables of critical point ) . on the other hand",
    ", the classical stability of the model is connected to the perturbations @xmath192 ( and depends on the conditions @xmath193 ) while the quantum stability is related to the perturbations @xmath194 and the conditions take the form of inequalities ( 24 )",
    ". thus the critical points can be classified into three categories namely +   + ( i ) unstable points at which the model is stable .",
    "+ ( ii ) stable points at which model is unstable and + ( iii ) stable points with stable ( both classical and quantum ) model .",
    "+   + from the table i , the equilibrium points @xmath104 and @xmath105 are interesting in the present context , they purely describe the scalar field dominated solutions in the @xmath0 model and describe the late time acceleration .",
    "so , we conclude that although the equilibrium points @xmath104 , @xmath105 correspond to stable model configuration but locally they are not stable equilibrium points .",
    "however , it should be noted that the dimensionless variables introduced in equation ( 15 ) are not suitable for a complete analysis .",
    "though , the analysis of the static solutions that correspond to equilibrium points at infinity could be analyzed by poincare projection technique , but for bouncing scenario the expansion rate may pass through zero making the state space non - compact .",
    "therefore , for future work , it is desirable to choose appropriate compact variables to care of expansions , collapses , static solutions and bounces as well .",
