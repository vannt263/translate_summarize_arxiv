    "there has been recent interest in the timing performance of long and thin plastic scintillation detectors with demands on the time resolution of 100ps and below , e.g.  for the future experiment at fair  @xcite . an existing experiment with a challanging scintillator system",
    "is compass with the installation of the 2.8 m long and 4 mm thin recoil detector under way  @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that the detector performance required by these experiments is close to the fundamental limit that arises from the statistical fluctuations in the process of the signal generation .    at",
    ", the identification of charged particles with momenta up to several gev@xmath0 will be performed by the detection of internally reflected cherenkov ( dirc ) light  @xcite .",
    "any measurement of the time - of - propagation ( top ) in the dirc counter needs a precise time reference and can be combined with the time - of - flight ( tof ) information from long scintillator slabs in front of the radiator barrel of the dirc . within the almost fully hermetic detector",
    "such a scintillator array needs to be as thin as physically possible . at compass",
    ", it is the need for a low momentum proton detection that requires the scintillators to be very thin .",
    "the timing properties of scintillators are usually defined in terms of a coincidence time resolution . in a typical laboratory measurement",
    "the time difference between the discriminated signals of two photomultipliers ( pmts ) placed at the extremes of a sample of scintillator is measured for minimum ionising particles crossing the scintillator at its centre . for small counters of 45 cm length and 20 mm thickness",
    "a time resolution reduced for one pmt of the order of fwhm @xmath1 150ps has been achieved by the authors in the laboratory . for long scintillators",
    "there are several effects degrading the time resolution , namely the light attenuation and the consequences of the scintillator acting as a light guide with corresponding propagation time dispersion .",
    "first photoelectron timing errors have been evaluated for slow scintillators ( bgo , @xmath2ns ) and larger amplitudes ( number of photoelectrons @xmath3 ) previously  @xcite , but not for fast plastic scintillators and small amplitudes , where the achievable timing performance depends also on path length variations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss expressions for the timing error which include propagation time dispersion and to verify experimentally the the correlation between signal time and average photon angle at the read - out end of a scintillator .",
    "one fundamental limit on the time resolution of scintillation counters comes as a consequence of the statistical processes involved in the generation of the signal .",
    "post and schiff  @xcite have first discussed such limitations . in general , the voltage pulse of a photomultiplier , @xmath4 , can be expressed as a linear superposition of @xmath5 single photoelectron pulses , @xmath6 , whose amplitude is allowed to vary due to gain fluctuations , @xmath7 , governed by a measurable probability distribution .",
    "the pulses arrive at individual times due to the time spread in the energy transfer to the optical scintillator levels , @xmath8 , the decay time of the light emitting states , @xmath9 , the propagation time , @xmath10 , and the transit time , @xmath11 , being the time difference between photo - emission at the cathode and the arrival of the subsequent electric signal at the anode .",
    "in addition , there is white gaussian electronic noise , @xmath12 .",
    "we incorporate these processes into a general model : @xmath13 , where @xmath5 fluctuates from one pulse to another . in a semi - classical model the probability for observing @xmath5 photoelectrons during a time interval @xmath14 is given by a poissonian distribution @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the mean number of photoelectrons per pulse .",
    "the following calculation is focused on the limitations arising from the contribution of the path length variation .",
    "central to the calculation is the relation between initial axial angle , @xmath17 , and propagation time : @xmath18 , for a point like source of light placed at a distance @xmath19 from the end face of a cylindrical scintillator with refractive index @xmath20 in a medium of refractive index @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the complement of the total internal reflection angle , @xmath23 . in the case of a rectangular shaped scintillator",
    "the relation is still valid as can be seen from the following consideration : in any reflection the change in the velocity vector of a particular photon takes place in the direction perpendicular to the face it hits .",
    "the component of this vector along the longitudinal axis remains unchanged during the whole motion and therefore the propagation time only depends on the initial axial angle , distance to the pmt , and index of refraction .",
    "consequently , a detector displaced by a distance @xmath24 from the end face of the scintillator would link in one linear dimension the angle and propagation time with an accuracy given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the thickness of the scintillator and @xmath27 the aperture of the detector .    for a quantitative description including extended light sources , light attenuation and refraction a full photon tracking simulation with the correct geometry of the set - up and a good model of scintillation light excitation and emission",
    "was needed .",
    "a general purpose monte carlo program  @xcite simulating light propagation was used to compute the average photon angle with respect to the detection plane and the average propagation time .    experimentally , the quality of a scintillator surface limits the conservation of photon angles .",
    "small geometrical inhomogeneities can have a strong impact on the transmission of photons and then the correlation between detection position and propagation time is heavily affected .",
    "there is no straight forward method for the estimation of the parameters necessary for an appropriate simulation of the surface quality .",
    "in fact , a monte carlo refractive index matching technique was developed only very recently to determine these parameters  @xcite .",
    "it was therefore mandatory to perform an experiment with a sample of plastic scintillator in order to investigate empirically the mentioned correlation .    in an experiment",
    "the discriminators and any noise in the electronic circuits contribute to the time spread .",
    "further , the response time of discriminators may shift with signal amplitude ( `` time walk '' ) .",
    "time walk effects are relevant if a large range of amplitudes is discriminated and can get corrected by various means , either in hardware or software .",
    "it is a standard in nuclear physics to use constant fraction discriminators ( cfd ) and leading edge discriminators ( led ) , the latter showing a characteristic time walk . in many cases",
    "constant fraction timing provides the best time resolution with scintillation counters .",
    "the situation is significantly different when the number of photons is small . in this case",
    "the sampling of the arrival time distribution is poor and the signal shape is very variable . fig .  [",
    "fig : signal ] shows the trace of a pmt voltage pulse for low light intensities as measured with a digital oscilloscope and the result of a monte carlo calculation for @xmath28 2 photoelectrons .",
    "the voltage pulse of a single photoelectron was modelled by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the gain of the pmt , @xmath31 is the conversion factor for charge to voltage and @xmath32 has been chosen to be 4ns in order to match the signal of the pmt used in the experimental set - up .",
    "a large distribution of pulse shapes reflecting the different arrival times of the individual photons is possible and the confounding effect of the overlapping single photon responses leads to problems with leading edge and peak detectors .",
    "thus , the timing performance in the pile - up case degrades considerable from single photon timing .",
    "the spread of propagation times is given by @xmath33 for the minimum and maximum propagation times of meridional rays , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the probability density function of the propagation times of photons , @xmath36 , produced by an event at @xmath37 , can be calculated from the angular distribution of photons inside the scintillator , @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . finally , the probability density for the arrival times at the photocathode due to path length variations is @xmath41 .",
    "the arrival time probability density function for a realistic scintillator can be folded in as follows : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is survival probability depending on the bulk absorption coefficient , @xmath44 , in the material .",
    "the distribution of decay times of light emitting states is included with a light pulse shape of the form : @xmath45 / ( 1 + r)$ ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two fast decay constants , @xmath48 corresponds to the decay time of the slow component , and @xmath49 is the ratio of the slow to fast components . for the parameters of emission time",
    "distribution values of @xmath50 0.9ns , @xmath51 2.1ns , @xmath52 14.2ns , and @xmath53 0.27 were chosen .",
    "comparable values are given in ref .",
    "the probability density function of the transit time spread of electrons in the photomultiplier , @xmath54 is not relevant for the following discussion , since micro - channel plate pmts provide an alternative with excellent timing capabilities .",
    "analytical descriptions of the probability density functions describing the time jitter of photoelectrons generated at the photocathode have been discussed before , e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "the probability for a photoelectron to be detected in the interval between @xmath55 and @xmath56 is @xmath57 . assuming a poissonian distribution for the probability that a definite number of photoelectrons , @xmath58 , has been accumulated leads to the signal time distribution @xmath59^{n_\\mathrm{thr}-1 } [ 1-p(t)]^{n - n_\\mathrm{thr}}$ ] , which is to be normalised for getting the probability density function .",

    "it was important for the conservation of photon angles that the faces of the scintillator were not wrapped or covered .",
    "a minimum contact area of the bar at only two edges was accomplished by placing the scintillator along the longitudinal axis of a black metallic tube of the proper dimensions .",
    "the two tubes of 1inch diameter were of type r4998 from hamamatsu with a fast time response and a linear focused dynode structure of 10 stages , leading to a transit time spread of only @xmath72 160ps . at one end",

    "the signals were digitised by a charge integrating analogue - to - digital converter ( lecroy 1885f , 50fc@xmath75count ) and by a lecroy time - to - digital converter ( lecroy 1875 , 25ps@xmath75count ) .",

    "[ fig : timeresvsint ] .",
    "with increasing amplitude the resolution improved until it levelled off at about fwhm @xmath79ps , demonstrating that at high intensities the photon statistics is no longer decisive and the resolution is supposedly dominated by electronic noise .",
    "a function of the form fwhm @xmath80 has been fitted to the data under the assumption that the detector response becomes gaussian as the number of photoelectrons increases .",
    "[ fig : contour - plots ] shows the positions of the aperture in the detection plane as points in the x- and y - dimension .",
    "for each point signal time and amplitude have been measured at a distance of 1 cm from the end face of the scintillator .",
    "only the upper half plane was scanned due to the symmetric behaviour of all observables expected on grounds of the geometrical symmetry .",
    "the points are superimposed on the measured data presented as contour lines with steps of 100ps in signal time ( right ) and steps of @xmath81100channels in amplitude ( left ) .",

    "[ fig : timevspos ] shows the variation of the signal time as a function of the position of the aperture with respect to the centre , when the laser light is injected at @xmath60 80 , 100 , and 140 cm .",
    "a signal time difference approximately linear with the distance for a given aperture position was observed .    in a perfect scintillator",
    "the portion of the light cone that lies inside the total internal reflection angle is transported undistorted to the end of the slab . since the transmission involves many reflections , the exit angle from a real scintillator is dependent on the sharpness of its edges and the parallelism of its faces .",
    "the measurements showed an unambiguous correlation between signal time and tube position and demonstrated an sufficient conservation of axial angles .",
    "the observed correlation is not masked by a change of apparent anode sensitivity with angle of incidence at the photocathode .",
    "although , the photomultiplier tube sensitivity depends on the incident angle since the path length of a photon through the photocathode increases like @xmath82 giving a corresponding higher probability for the emission of a photoelectron  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent course of this electron is , however , not simple and the cosine law can only be considered as a first approximation .",
    "it would imply that at non - central aperture positions amplitude losses get partly compensated and effects of the propagation time dispersion get emphasised .",
