    "ss433 is the only known persistent superaccretor in the galaxy  a source of relativistic jets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "this is a massive close binary , where the compact star is most probably a black hole @xcite .",
    "ss433 intrinsic luminosity is estimated to be @xmath13erg / s , with its maximum located in non - observed uv region . in effect this is a very blue , but heavily absorbed object ; its estimated temperature depends on the accretion disc orientation @xcite , being @xmath14k when the disc is the most open to the observer .",
    "it is important that almost all the observed radiation is formed in the supercritical accretion disc , and the donor star contributes less than 20% of the optical radiation .",
    "the system s extreme luminosity suggests that the black hole s mass is @xmath15m@xmath16 .",
    "such a big energy budget of the object is supported by a very well measured kinetic luminosity of the jets , @xmath17erg / s , both in direct x - ray and optical studies of the jets and in the studies of the jet - powered nebula w50 @xcite . at the same time",
    "we know that practically all the energy at the accretion onto a relativistic star is released in x - rays .",
    "this means that the observed radiation of ss433 was thermalised in the strong wind coming from the supercritical disc .",
    "the wind from a supercritical disc was first predicted by @xcite and later confirmed in radiation - hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "these ideas led to a prediction that ss433 , being observed face - on appears as an extremely bright x - ray source , and we may expect an appearance of a new type of x - ray sources in galaxies @xcite  the face - on ss433 stars .",
    "it is quite possible that the new type of x - ray sources , ulxs ( ultraluminous x - ray sources , @xcite ) are ss433-like objects observed nearly face - on .",
    "their observed x - ray luminosities are @xmath18erg / s and they are certainly related to the massive star population .",
    "the disc orientation in ss433 is about edge - on , the angle between the disc plane and the line of sight is @xmath19 , due to the precessional variations .",
    "therefore we have no chance to observe the funnel in the supercritical disc directly .",
    "the supercritical disc radiation is not isotropic .",
    "if one takes into account the geometrical beaming in the disc funnel with the ( half ) opening angle @xmath20 @xcite and that a supercritical disc surface radiation is local eddington @xcite , one finds @xcite , that the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath21erg / s is expected for the face - on ss433 star .",
    "the recent data show @xcite that ulxs posses curvature and rather flat x - ray spectra , which are difficult to interpret with a single - component or any other simple model .",
    "the supercritical accretion discs are expected to have flat ( @xmath22 ) x - ray spectrum @xcite , because the energy release @xmath23 in the discs must be @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) to make the disc thick due to the radiation pressure .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ss433 is @xmath26erg / s ( at a distance of 5.5kpc @xcite ) , four orders of magnitude less than the bolometric luminosity .",
    "it is believed that all the x - rays come from the cooling x - ray jets .",
    "the jet may be easily accelerated by the radiation in the hydrodynamic funnel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the supercritical disc .",
    "the jet velocity value , @xmath27 , and its unique stability , where the velocity does not depend on the activity state , indicate that the jet acceleration must be controlled by the line - locking mechanism @xcite .",
    "the funnel has to be relatively transparent for the accelerating radiation , as it was confirmed in radiation - hydrodynamic simulatuons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these reasonings , however , bear a problem , why do not we observe any funnel radiation , missing four orders of magnitude in the x - rays ?",
    "even a small amount of gas in the most outer part of the funnel , where we observe the x - ray jet base , may reflect and scatter some part of the direct @xmath13erg / s of the funnel radiation .",
    "the structure of the funnel and the jet acceleration / collimation region is unknown .",
    "apparently , the direct funnel radiation is entirely blocked for the observer .",
    "the standard jet model @xcite suggests that all the observed x - ray radiation of ss433 is formed in the cooling x - ray jets .",
    "however , an analysis of the latest xmm observations @xcite led the authors to a conclusion that the standard jet model can not produce the observed x - ray continuum .    in the standard jet model",
    "there are two conical anti - parallel jets , considered identical .",
    "the jet s gas is optically thin , being in collisional ionization equilibrium and cooling adiabatically ( or adiabatically plus radiatively ) .",
    "the jets are observed beginning from the jet base @xmath28 ( the distance between the base of the visible jet and the black hole , different for the red and blue jets ) , which depends on the precessional phase and on the eclipses by the donor star .",
    "the gas temperature at the jet base @xmath29 is estimated from observations .",
    "precessional and orbital variability of ss433 is well - known @xcite , the jets ( and both the accretion disc , and the accretion disc wind ) precess with a 164-day period and an amplitude of @xmath30 . at the precessional phase @xmath31 the disc is the most open to the observer , the angle between the jets and line of sight is @xmath32 ( we refer here to the approximate values because there are nutation - like and sporadic variabilities , both of about @xmath33 ) . the accretion disc rim ( or the opaque part of the wind )",
    "is thick @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "comparing the amplitudes of the precessional and orbital variabilities in different x - ray bands , @xcite found that both the donor star and the outer disc rim have about the same size , therefore , one may expect the same radius for the approaching jet base @xmath35 cm .    in x - ray observations with asca and chandra @xcite , dozens of x - ray emission lines formed both in blue and red jets were resolved .",
    "the lines are variable both in positions ( in accordance with the jet kinematic model ) and in intensities , the strongest are he- and h - like @xmath36 and @xmath37 iron lines .",
    "this allowed the iron line diagnostics of the gas temperature at the jet bases by measuring the line ratio fexxv / fexxvi .",
    "the temperature at the base of the jet was estimated as @xmath38  kev @xcite . in the latest xmm - newton observations",
    "@xcite estimate the temperature of about @xmath39  kev , with the main uncertainty coming from the form of the underlying continuum . fitting the continuum with a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( ginga data ,",
    "* ) gives a notably bigger value , @xmath40  kev .",
    "the jet base temperature determined both in the line diagnostics and in the continuum fits , drops notably in eclipses , what confirms the cooling jet model . analysing the numerous asca data",
    ", @xcite found that the farther part of the receding jet is weakened ( probably absorbed in the external gas located in the disc plane ) and nickel is highly overabundant ( @xmath15 times ) in the jets .",
    "the last finding has been confirmed in the xmm observations @xcite .",
    "note that some discrepancies may exist as the system ss433 is highly variable and its appearance depends strongly on the precessional phase .",
    "@xcite found that the xmm ss433 spectrum can not be fitted with any simple continuum law .",
    "the numerous lines point at the thermal model , but a strong continuum curvature indicates the comptonization .",
    "the best formal model of the additional continuum component is a broken power law with a break at @xmath41  kev , where the low energy pl rises with energy ( @xmath42 ) , the high energy part is rather steep ( @xmath43 ) , however , the parameters are not usually well determined in the fits .",
    "the overall continuum is too hard to be bremsstrahlung , the electron - electron bremsstrahlung can not fit it even for the temperatures of 40  kev .",
    "a highly absorbed additional thermal component gives a too strong @xmath44  kev edge .",
    "@xcite discuss a model with a single , very broad @xmath44  kev line , which may be formed in the innermost hot jet ( otherwise hidden ) and compton down - scattered by colder material .",
    "these uncertainties in continuum make problems for the iron - line diagnostics of the jet base temperature .",
    "practically in all the studies of ss433 x - ray spectra the jet mass loss @xmath45 and the jet kinetic luminosity @xmath46 were determined . to estimate @xmath47",
    "one needs to adopt the jet ( half ) opening angle @xmath48 .",
    "the mass loss rate derived from the x - ray line intensities depends strongly on the opening angle adopted , i.  e. gas density at the jet base , because the emission measure is @xmath49 .",
    "the kinetic luminosity values derived from x - ray spectra were quite diverse , up to @xmath50erg / s .",
    "however , in two latest studies , one from the chandra data @xcite and the other from the xmm data @xcite , the values are @xmath51 and @xmath52erg / s respectively .",
    "they are even closer to one another , matching different distances to ss433 adopted by these authors .",
    "@xcite found @xmath53erg / s from the jet balmer line intensities in optical spectra .",
    "the mass loss rate in the jets was estimated @xcite on the base of w50 nebula powered by the jets with approximately the same result , @xmath53erg / s .",
    "thus the jet kinetic luminosity was measured with relatively good accuracy .",
    "the jet opening angle was directly measured in the studies of x - ray and optical line widths @xcite .",
    "@xcite found @xmath54 from the chandra spectra .",
    "they assumed that the density is uniform through the jet cone s cross section and @xmath48 is the jet s cross sectional radius .",
    "@xcite found @xmath55 from optical spectra , assuming that the emitting gas density is gaussian - distributed in the cone s cross section .",
    "we give here the values of @xmath48 recalculated , using the @xcite definition .",
    "such a coincidence in the x - ray and optical jet opening angles makes the jets pure ballistic from x - ray ( @xmath56 cm ) to optical ( @xmath57 cm ) regions . in optical spectra",
    "the jet opening angle has been estimated from h@xmath58 line profiles during 8-day long observations , the nutation broading has been taken into account and possible jet sporadic activity was diminished .",
    "in other chandra observations @xcite the opening angle has been found twice as big and it was greater in the higher temperature ( fe ) , than in the lower temperature ( si ) parts of the jets .",
    "regarding comparatively short time scales of the x - ray observations and probable line broading due to electron scattering @xcite in the hottest parts of the jet , we may adopt @xmath59 as a good estimate of the jet opening angle .",
    "in this paper we analyse x - ray spectra of ss433 using xmm data and the standard jet model .",
    "we do not try to determine the jet kinetic luminosity , because the x - ray continuum is complex and can not be explained in the standard jet model @xcite .",
    "instead we adopt these two main parameters ",
    "@xmath60erg / s ( @xmath61g / s ) and @xmath62 , as well established and known .",
    "we find that the line fluxes can be well matched with the standard jet model and study the additional components of the x - ray spectrum of ss433 .",
    "we used a public archive of the xmm - newton observatory .",
    "there are 8 observations of ss433 in the archive , where the target was in the detector s centre .",
    "they were carried out in april 2003 ( 4 observations at the precessional phase @xmath63 ) , october 2003 ( 2 observations at @xmath31 ) , and two single observations in march 2004 and april 2004 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the study of x - ray jets and the thick accretion disc ( its wind ) .",
    "then we have selected only those observations , where disc was not eclipsed by the donor and was the most open to the observer .",
    "this is the observation taken on 19 october 2003 in orbit 707 ( @xmath64 ) in the orbital phase @xmath65 ( for orbital and precessional phases see @xcite ) . for comparison purposes we selected the observation from 6 april 2003 in orbit 609 , taken at the intermediate inclination ( @xmath66 ) of the disc and at about the same orbital phase @xmath67 .",
    "the last observation is relatively short , hence we added the following observation taken in the same accretion disc precessional position , in orbit 610 ( @xmath68 ) for a control check .",
    "these data allow us to study the jets and the disc wind at two different orientations of the disc / jets and at about the same orbital phase .",
    "with such a strong mass transfer in the system , the jet and the accretion disc funnel visibility behind the wind photosphere ( the outer disc rim ) may be dependent on the orbital phase .",
    "we use the epic pn observations to get the highest signal - to - noise data . during all the observations",
    "the epic pn camera was operated in the small window mode with a medium filter .",
    "the pn data were reprocessed using the xmmsas version 6.1 .",
    "the actual life time of the detector after a correction for good time intervals was 11.4ksec in orbit 707 , 4.4ksec in orbit 609 and 5.6ksec in orbit 610 .",
    "to model the jet spectrum we use the standard approach which was used by many authors to analyse the x - ray spectra of ss433 @xcite .",
    "this standard multi - temperature model describes well both the jet line spectrum and its variability .",
    "the jet gas moves in ballistic trajectories with a velocity @xmath69 .",
    "in such a case the gas concentration can be written as follows : @xmath70 here @xmath28 is the visible jet base ( the distance between the base and the black hole ) , @xmath71 is the solid opening angle of the jet , @xmath45  the mass loss rate in the jet , @xmath72  the mass of a proton , @xmath73  molecular weight .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath74 along the jet accounting for adiabatic and radiation cooling is determinated by the equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 stands for specific energy losses by radiation per one particle .",
    "introducing new variables @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 one may write the equation ( [ e : thermo2 ] ) in a dimensionless form : @xmath80 where @xmath58 is a coefficient depending on physical parameters of the jet @xmath45 and @xmath28 : @xmath81 the introduced value @xmath82 is the total emissivity of the plasma , and radiation losses integrated over all energies , @xmath83 the value @xmath82 is tabulated in the model of hot , optically thin plasma apec / aped , which uses the atomic database atomdb v1.3.1 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "atomdb provides an improved spectral modelling capability through additional emission lines , accurate wavelengths for strong x - ray transitions , and new density - dependent calculations ( for more details see http://cxc.harvard.edu/atomdb/ ) .",
    "relativistic boosting is taken into account in this model .",
    "the model provides a possibility of separate analysis of both line and continuum emissivities .    to calculate the multi - temperature jet spectrum we divide the jet in 20 equal parts in the section @xmath84 , the gas temperature at @xmath85 drops below 100ev , where the thermal instabilities begin to operate @xcite .",
    "one needs to consider many ( at least 20 ) mono - temperatute parts of the jet , because the radiative cooling begins to dominate the adiabatic cooling at temperatures below @xmath86kev and has a strong peak at @xmath87kev .",
    "the total spectrum of the jet is calculated using the formula : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the plasma emissivity and @xmath90 is the spectrum normalisation of @xmath91-th part of the jet : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a distance to ss433 ( 5.5kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "the integration is carried out over the jet portion volumes @xmath94 .",
    "the average gas temperature of the @xmath91-th part of the jet @xmath95 is estimated as follows : @xmath96    the main parameters which define the physical state of the jet are gas density and temperature @xmath97 at the visible jet base .",
    "the density depends on the mass loss rate @xmath45 and the jet ( half ) opening angle @xmath48 . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the last two parameters were relatively well measured in ss433 in previous studies not only in x - ray range .",
    "the opening angle was particularly very well measured in optical studies . to make our analysis more certain",
    "we do not try to determine the jet kinetic luminosity ( the mass loss rate ) from the xmm spectra , the more so , that one has serious problems with an interpretation of continuum at @xmath44  kev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt the parameters @xmath98erg / s and @xmath99 as already known .    from all previous x - ray studies we may expect the gas temperature at the base is in the range of @xmath100  kev ( see introduction ) , and the visible jet base @xmath35 cm .",
    "the last estimate is quite substantial , it was argued above , that both the donor star and the outer disc rim have about the same size @xcite .",
    "the partial eclipses of the x - ray jets by the donor observed in ss433 prove the estimate of the x - ray jet base @xmath28 .    in the thermal jet model",
    "we adopt the solar abundance of elements , however , nickel is 10 times overabundant @xcite .",
    "section [ reflection ] discusses this in detail .",
    "kev , is obtained in orbit 707 ( @xmath101 ) , a slightly lower temperature in orbit 610 ( @xmath63 ) ; in orbit 609 we find the temperature @xmath102  kev with notably bigger uncertainty . ,",
    "in this section we estimate the jet parameters @xmath103 and @xmath28 using the fluxes and the flux ratio of the iron lines fexxvk@xmath104 and fexxvily@xmath104 @xcite and adopting a simple local pl continuum .",
    "these fexxv and fexxvi lines formed in the approaching jet are the strongest and well resolved in the xmm spectra .",
    "the resulting line fluxes depend on the underlying continuum model .",
    "therefore we use the simplest continuum to analyse here how stable are the derived parameters depending on @xmath45 and on the errors of the measured line fluxes .",
    "we do not examine here different continuum models , because @xcite have studied these xmm spectra using many versions of continuum and concluded that `` the high sensitivity and wide bandpass of the xmm - newton instruments rule out any of the simple continuum models used previously '' .",
    "instead in the section below we find clear evidences for a certain additional continuum component ( reflection ) , study the whole spectrum with these two models , thermal jet and reflection , and correct the values of @xmath103 and @xmath28 .",

    "hereat we added a bb component , which might be an indication of the supercritical accretion disc funnel ( a wind ) radiation ( see section [ disc ] ) . in fig.[f : reflobs ] we show the observed spectrum of ss433 along with the model fits jet - plus - reflection in the four spectral ranges .",
    "table[t : approx ] presents the model parameters .",
    "the thermal jet model is identical in all ranges , yet the reflected component was fitted independently in each range ( however there is no reflection in low energies ) .",
    "the blue jet parameters were found in the high energy range 7.012.0  kev matching the model fluxes and flux ratios of the he- and h - like iron lines to the observed values .",
    "we do not see any need to use non - solar abundances of the elements , but ni is clearly overabundant .",
    "@xcite found the ni abundance to be about 8 times solar .",
    "our fits show that ni has to be overabundant by a factor 10 , since the ni line is inside the broad absorption feature ( fig.[f : reflobs]d ) .",

    "the red jet base is of @xmath113 cm , which is naturally explained by the obscuration of the red jet by the accretion disc ( the wind ) body in this orientation of the disc . in the precessional phase @xmath114 , where one may expect an obscuration of a bigger portion of the blue jet we find a lower temperature , @xmath115  kev .",
    "however , @xmath116 is about the same in both precessional phases . the spectra taken at @xmath114 are notably noisier than the one taken at @xmath110 .",
    "finding accurate jet parameters is not the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "the results depend on the natural variability in the jet activity , besides that the physical picture may be more complex ( possible gas clumping , heating effects due to kinetic energy dissipation or the funnel radiation ) . however , the derived jet visible base @xmath117 cm is too small , while it has to be about @xmath118 cm to satisfy the observed eclipses by the donor star .",
    "the inner hotter portions of the jet are partially eclipsed @xcite .",

    "the reflection features at 6.26.8  kev are well produced .",

    "the supercritical accretion disc spectrum is expected to be flat @xcite , however , it is supposed to go up to a few kev only . the comptonization may extend and flatten the spectrum to higher energies .",
    "at an accretion rate of @xmath234 of the eddington rate , the local emitted spectrum in the inner region of the disc is approximated by a diluted bb with the spectral hardening factor @xmath235 @xcite .",

    ", one may expect the comptonization is significant inside the funnel .",
    "the observed spectrum , taken when the disc is the most open to the observer @xcite , is nearly flat in the energy range of 1020  kev .",
    "this spectrum may be a continuation of the flat 712  kev spectrum found here in the reflecting model .",
    "the soft excess detected in the ss433 spectra and introduced here as a bb component with the temperature of @xmath11  kev ( table[t : approx ] , fig.[f : add ] ) , may appear to be the direct radiation of the visible funnel wall at @xmath239 ( fig.[f : geometry ] ) .",
    "when we take into account the factor @xmath215 , which is a ratio of the total cone surface at @xmath138 to the visible cone surface , we find the soft bb component luminosity @xmath144erg / s .    the soft bb component is shown in fig.[f : add ] .",
    "note that the luminosity of the soft component strongly depends on the adopted column density @xmath109 .",

    "deriving these spectra , we adopted the wind s photosphere radius and the temperature of @xmath243 cm , @xmath244  k respectively ( [ eq : rtphot_w ] ) , and @xmath183 as it was discussed above .",
    "this illustrates that the mcf spectra might be responsible for the soft excess observed in ss433 .",
    "nevertheless , one can say nothing else , exept that the additional soft component is present in ss433 spectrum .",
    "the soft excess is observed in the spectra of ulxs @xcite , their temperature is @xmath245  kev and it contributes to the total ulx luminosity of @xmath234 .",
    "the soft component luminosity in ulxs is about @xmath246erg / s . if the ulxs are nearly face - on ss433 stars , their intrinsic soft component luminosity has to be some less because of the geometrical beaming of their supercritical discs .",
    "however , the soft x - ray luminosity is model dependent , it strongly depends on the adopted absorption value .",
    "the goal of the present paper was to find indications of the supercritical accretion disc funnel in ss433 x - ray radiation .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the disc in ss433 is @xmath13erg / s and all the luminosity must be initially released in x - rays .",
    "this is confirmed by the well - established kinetic luminosity of ss433 jets , which is @xmath17erg / s , and the fact that the jets are formed in the deepest places of the disc funnel close to the black hole .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of ss433 is @xmath26erg / s and it is the radiation of the cooling x - ray jets .",
    "both the orientation of ss433 and the visibility conditions do not allow us to see any deep areas of the funnel .",

    "we confirm the previous finding @xcite that the red jet is probably not seen ( blocked ) in the soft energy range of 0.8  2.0  kev .",
    "however , both the model with blocked the red jet portions , and the model with the whole red jet visible ( but with some higher @xmath109 ) give the same result , that the thermal jet model alone can not explain the soft continuum .",
    "we also confirm that nickel is highly overabundant in the jets @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the luminosity @xmath60erg / s and the jet opening angle @xmath62 as well established and known .",
    "however , the derived jet visible base @xmath248 is too small , it has to be @xmath56 cm to satisfy the observed eclipses by the donor star . using the scaling formula @xmath119",
    "one may find that during these xmm observations the jet kinetic luminosity was @xmath1erg / s .",
    "this scaling should not change the thermal jet spectrum .",
    "we find that the thermal jet model alone can not reproduce the continuum radiation in the xmm spectral range .",
    "therefore we use the thermal jet model together with the reflion ionized reflection model and find quite a good representation of the spectra . introducing the reflection not only explains the continuum curvature at the energies of @xmath249  kev and the fluorescent line of quasi - neutral iron , it reproduces the broad absorption feature at @xmath250  kev recently detected by @xcite .",
