    "given a virtual knot @xmath1 , we examine a family of group - valued invariants of @xmath1 that includes the extended group @xmath4 introduced by silver and williams in @xcite , the quandle group @xmath5 that was first defined by manturov @xcite and later studied by bardakov and bellingeri @xcite , and the virtual knot group @xmath3 introduced in @xcite .",
    "we define yet another group - valued invariant denoted @xmath0 and called the reduced virtual knot group . using this new group",
    ", we explore the relationships between @xmath9 and @xmath3 by proving that the virtual knot group splits as @xmath10 , and that @xmath11 are isomorphic .",
    "we then study the alexander invariants of @xmath0 , which by the previous results carry the same information about the virtual knot @xmath1 as @xmath9 and @xmath3 . in @xcite ,",
    "the virtual alexander polynomial @xmath12 is defined in terms of the zeroth order elementary ideal of @xmath3 ; and @xcite shows that @xmath12 admits a normalization , satisfies a skein formula , and carries useful information about the virtual crossing number @xmath13 of @xmath1 .",
    "the same is therefore true of the polynomial invariant @xmath14 defined here in terms of the zeroth order elementary ideal of @xmath0 .",
    "we use the group - valued invariant @xmath0 to investigate virtual knots that admit alexander numberings , also known as _ almost classical knots_. we show that if @xmath1 is almost classical , then @xmath0 splits as @xmath15 , and we prove a similar result for virtual knots that admit a mod @xmath8 alexander numbering and we refer to them as mod @xmath8 almost classical knots .",
    "thus , the group @xmath0 provides a useful obstruction for a knot @xmath1 to be mod @xmath8 almost classical , for instance the polynomial @xmath16 must vanish upon setting @xmath17 for any non - trivial @xmath8-th root of unity @xmath18    virtual knots were introduced by kauffman in @xcite , and they can be viewed as knots in thickened surfaces . from that point of view , almost classical knots correspond to knots which are homologically trivial . for an almost classical knot or link @xmath1 , and we give a construction of an oriented surface @xmath19 with @xmath20 which we call a seifert surface for @xmath1 .",
    "we use this surface to construct the infinite cyclic cover @xmath21 associated to @xmath1 and to give a new proof that the first elementary ideal @xmath22 is principal whenever @xmath1 is almost classical .",
    "this was previously demonstrated by nakamura , nakanishi , satoh , and tomiyama in @xcite for almost classical knots , and their proof uses the alexander numbering of @xmath1 to construct a nonzero element in the left kernel of an alexander matrix associated to a presentation of @xmath7 .",
    "we define the alexander polynomial @xmath23 $ ] for an almost classical knot or link @xmath1 in terms of @xmath22 , and we show that it satisfies a skein formula , see theorem [ skein - theorem ] .",
    "interestingly , theorem 7 of @xcite implies that the skein formula does not extend to all virtual knots .",
    "there is an analogous result for mod @xmath8 almost classical knots @xmath1 ; their first elementary ideal @xmath22 is principal over the ring @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is a primitive @xmath8-th root of unity .",
    "thus the alexander `` polynomial '' @xmath26 of a mod @xmath8 almost classical knot is defined , not as a laurent polynomial , but rather as an element in @xmath24 $ ] , the ring of integers in the cyclotomic field @xmath27 .",
    "it is well - defined up to units in @xmath24 $ ] .    using manturov s notion of parity @xcite ,",
    "we show how to regard mod @xmath8 almost classical knots in terms of an ascending filtration on the set of all virtual knots , and we prove that any minimal crossing diagram of a mod @xmath8 almost classical knot is mod @xmath8 alexander numberable .",
    "jeremy green has classified virtual knots up to six crossings @xcite , and in this paper we use his notation in referring to specific virtual knots , for example in figure [ ac - knots ] showing the gauss diagrams of all 76 almost classical knots with six or fewer crossings as well as in table [ acks2 ] which lists their alexander polynomial @xmath28 and virtual genus @xmath29",
    "in this section , we recall three equivalent definitions of virtual knots .",
    "the first definition is in terms of a virtual knot or link diagram , which consists of an immersion of one or several circles in the plane with only double points , such that each double point is either classical ( indicated by over- and under - crossings ) or virtual ( indicated by a circle ) .",
    "the diagram is oriented if every component has an orientation , and two oriented virtual link diagrams are _ virtually isotopic _ if they can be related by planar isotopies and a series of _ generalized reidemeister moves _ ( @xmath30)(@xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32)(@xmath33 ) depicted in figure [ vrm ] .",
    "virtual isotopy defines an equivalence relation on virtual link diagrams , and a virtual link is defined to be an equivalence class of virtual link diagrams under virtual isotopy .",
    "one can alternatively define a virtual knot or link @xmath1 in terms of its underlying gauss diagram , as originally proved by goussarov , polyak , and viro @xcite .",
    "a gauss diagram consists of one or several circles , one for each component of @xmath1 , along with signed , directed chords from each over - crossing to the corresponding under - crossing .",
    "the signs on the chords indicate whether the crossing is right - handed ( @xmath34 ) or left - handed ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the reidemeister moves can be translated into moves on gauss diagrams , and two gauss diagrams are called _ virtually isotopic _ if they are related by a sequence of reidemeister moves .",
    "virtual isotopy defines an equivalence relation on gauss diagrams , and virtual links can be defined as an equivalence classes of gauss diagrams under virtual isotopy @xcite .         given a gauss diagram @xmath36 with chords @xmath37 ,",
    "we define the index of the chord @xmath38 by counting the chords @xmath39 that intersect @xmath38 with sign and keeping track of direction .",
    "orient the diagram so that @xmath38 is vertical with its arrowhead oriented up . then chords @xmath39 can intersect @xmath38 either from right to left or from left to right , and they can have sign @xmath40 counting them gives four numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 which are defined as follows :    * number of @xmath43-chords intersecting @xmath38 with their arrowhead to the right , * number of @xmath43-chords intersecting @xmath38 with their arrowhead to the left .",
    "[ chord - index ] in terms of these numbers , the index of a chord @xmath38 in a gauss diagram @xmath36 is defined to be @xmath44 .",
    "for example , the gauss diagram in figure [ 2 - 1 ] has one chord with index @xmath45 and another with index @xmath46 .",
    "if a gauss diagram @xmath36 is planar , then it is a consequence of the jordan curve theorem that every chord @xmath38 has index @xmath47 this condition is necessary but not sufficient , the addition requirement is vanishing of the incidence matrix . for its definition as well as a full treatment of the planarity problem for gauss words ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the third definition is in terms of knots on a thickened surface .",
    "every virtual knot @xmath1 can be realized as a knot on a thickened surface , and by @xcite there is a one - to - one correspondence between virtual knots and stable equivalence classes of knots on thickened surfaces .",
    "kuperberg proved that every stable equivalence class has a unique irreducible representative @xcite , and the _ virtual genus _ of @xmath1 is defined to be the minimum genus over all surfaces containing a representative of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a virtual knot is classical if and only if it has virtual genus zero .        given a virtual knot or link diagram @xmath1 , there is a canonical surface @xmath48 called the carter surface which contains a knot or link representing @xmath1 .",
    "we review the construction of @xmath48 , following the treatment of n. kamada and s. kamada in @xcite .",
    "( the reader may also want to consult carter s paper @xcite . ) the surface @xmath48 is constructed by attaching two intersecting bands at every classical crossing and two non - intersecting bands at every virtual crossing , see figure [ band - surface ] .",
    "along the remaining arcs of @xmath1 attach non - intersecting and non - twisted bands , and the result is an oriented 2-manifold with boundary . by filling in each boundary component with a 2-disk , one obtains a closed oriented surface @xmath48 containing a representative of @xmath1 .",
    "two virtual knots or links are said to be _ welded equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by generalized reidemeister moves plus the forbidden overpass ( @xmath49 ) in figure [ vrm ] . in terms of gauss diagrams , this move corresponds to exchanging two adjacent arrow feet , see figure [ gd - forbidden ] .",
    "for gauss diagrams . ]",
    "in this section , we introduce a family of group - valued invariants of virtual knots .",
    "we begin with the knot group @xmath7 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is an oriented virtual knot with @xmath50 classical crossings , and choose a basepoint on k. starting at the base point , we label the arcs @xmath51 so that at each undercrossing , @xmath52 is the incoming arc and @xmath53 is the outgoing arc .",
    "we use a consistent labeling of the crossings so that the @xmath54-th crossing is as shown in figure [ knot - group - wirtinger ] . for @xmath55",
    "let @xmath56 be according to the sign of the @xmath54-th crossing .",
    "then the _ knot group of @xmath1 _ is the finitely presented group given by @xmath57 note that virtual crossings are ignored in this construction .     from the @xmath54-th crossing of @xmath1 .",
    "]    the knot group @xmath7 is invariant under all the moves in figure [ vrm ] including the forbidden overpass ( @xmath49 ) , thus it is an invariant of the underlying welded equivalence class of @xmath1 . in case @xmath1 is classical , we have @xmath58 the fundamental group of the complement of @xmath1 .",
    "the virtual knot group @xmath3 was introduced in @xcite ; it has one generator for each short arc of @xmath1 and two commuting generators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and there are two relations for each real and virtual crossing as in figure [ vgk - wirtinger ] . here",
    "the _ short arcs _ of @xmath1 are arcs that start at one real or virtual crossing and end at the next real or virtual crossing .    .",
    "]    the virtual knot group @xmath3 has as quotients various other knot groups that arise naturally in virtual knot theory .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath61 , one obtains the welded knot group @xmath62 , which is easily seen to be invariant under welded equivalence ( see @xcite ) . by setting @xmath63 ,",
    "one obtains the quandle group @xmath5 , which was first introduced by manturov in @xcite and further studied by bardakov and bellingeri in @xcite .    by setting",
    "@xmath64 one obtains the extended group @xmath4 , which was introduced by silver and williams in @xcite , where it is denoted by @xmath65 .",

    "notice that the constructions of @xmath7 and @xmath4 make no reference to virtual crossings , and in fact for both knots the virtual crossing relations are trivial .",
    "consequently , one can describe these groups entirely in terms of the gauss diagram for @xmath1 , which is advantageous in applying computer algorithms to perform algebraic computations .",
