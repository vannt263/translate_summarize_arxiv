    "( [ s1 ] ) . that would imply that our hard sphere model underestimates the heights of the potential wells necessary to create a mott insulator by as much as 50% .",
    "one of the reasons for this discrepancy could be that we have not included any longitudinal confinement ( @xmath122 ) in our hamiltonian .",
    "calculations on a pure 1d bh model including that effect have been performed at finite temperature @xcite , and indicate that @xmath110 increases when that effect is included .",

    "serve as a benchmark for three dimensional systems . in the future",
