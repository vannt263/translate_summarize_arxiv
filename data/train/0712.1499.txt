    "<S> we will identify situations occurring in proof - theoretical investigations of bounded arithmetic where this height is bounded by an iterated logarithm of some global size parameter , making these sizes feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> bounded arithmetic has been introduced by buss @xcite as theories of arithmetic with a strong connection to computational complexity . for sake of simplicity of this introduction </S>",
    "<S> , we will concentrate only on the bounded arithmetic theories @xmath6 by buss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these theories are given as first order theories of arithmetic in a language which suitably extends that of peano arithmetic where induction is restricted in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , logarithmic induction is considered which only inducts over a logarithmic part of the universe of discourse . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 here , @xmath22 denotes the length of the binary representation of the natural number  @xmath23 , which defines a kind of logarithm on natural numbers . </S>",
    "<S> second , the properties which can be inducted on , must be described by a suitably restricted ( `` bounded '' ) formula . </S>",
    "<S> the class of formulae used here are the @xmath5-formulae which exactly characterise @xmath24 , that is , properties of the @xmath7-th level of the polynomial time hierarchy of predicates . </S>",
    "<S> the theory s @xmath6 main ingredients are the instances of logarithmic induction for @xmath5 formulae .    </S>",
    "<S> let a ( multi-)function @xmath25 be called @xmath26-definable in @xmath6 , if its graph can be expressed by a @xmath26-formula @xmath27 , such that the totality of @xmath25 , which renders as @xmath28 , is provable from the @xmath6-axioms in first - order logic . </S>",
    "<S> the main results characterising definable ( multi- ) functions in bounded arithmetic are the following .    </S>",
    "<S> * buss @xcite has characterised the @xmath5-definable functions of @xmath6 as @xmath29 , the @xmath7-th level of the polynomial time hierarchy of functions . </S>",
    "<S> * krajek@xcite has characterised the @xmath30-definable multi - functions of @xmath31 as the class @xmath32 $ ] of multi - functions which can be computed in polynomial time using a witness oracle from @xmath24 , where the number of oracle queries is restricted to @xmath33 many ( @xmath17 being the length of the input ) . </S>",
    "<S> * buss and krajek@xcite have characterised the @xmath34-definable multi - functions of @xmath6 as projections of solutions to problems from @xmath35 , which is the class of polynomial local search problems relativised to @xmath36-oracles .    </S>",
    "<S> we will re - obtain all these definability characterisations by one unifying method using the results from the first part of this report in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will define a suitable notation system @xmath37for propositional derivations which are obtained by translating bounded arithmetic proofs . </S>",
    "<S> the propositional translation used here is well - known in proof - theoretic investigations ; the translation has been described by tait  @xcite , and later was independently discovered by paris and wilkie  @xcite . in the bounded - arithmetic world </S>",
    "<S> it is known as the _ paris - wilkie translation . </S>",
    "<S> _    applying the machinery from the first part we obtain a notation system @xmath38of cut - elimination for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38will have the property that its implicit descriptions , most notably the functions @xmath13 and @xmath15 $ ] mentioned above , will be polynomial time computable .    </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to formulate a general local search problem on @xmath38which is suitable to characterise definable multi - functions for bounded arithmetic . </S>",
    "<S> assume that @xmath28 , describing the totality of some multi - function , is provable in some bounded arithmetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> fix a particularly nice formal proof @xmath39 of this . given @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> we want to describe a procedure which finds some @xmath41 such that @xmath42 holds . </S>",
    "<S> invert the proof @xmath39 of @xmath28 to a proof of @xmath43 where @xmath23 is fresh a variable , then substitute @xmath44 for all occurrences of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a proof of @xmath45 . adding an appropriate number of cut - reduction operators we obtain a proof with all cut - formulae of ( at most ) the same logical complexity as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that a notation @xmath46 for this proof can be computed in time polynomial in @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the general local search problem which finds a witness for @xmath48 can now be characterised as follows . </S>",
    "<S> its instance is given by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the set of solutions are those notations of a suitable size , which denote a derivation having the property that the derived sequent is equivalent to @xmath49 where all @xmath50 are `` simple enough '' and false . </S>",
    "<S> an initial solution is given by @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> a neighbour to a solution @xmath3 is a solution which denotes an immediate sub - derivation of the derivation denoted by @xmath3 , if this exists , and @xmath3 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the cost of a notation is the height of the denoted derivation . </S>",
    "<S> the search task is to find a notation in the set of solutions which is a fixpoint of the neighbourhood function . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , a solution to the search task must exist . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , any solution of minimal cost has this property . </S>",
    "<S> now consider any solution to the search problem . </S>",
    "<S> it must have the property , that none of the immediate sub - derivations is in the solution space . </S>",
    "<S> this can only happen if the last inference derives @xmath48 from a true statement @xmath42 for some @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath41 is a witness to @xmath48 , and we can output @xmath41 as a solution to our original witnessing problem .    depending on the complexity of logarithmic induction present in the bounded arithmetic theory we started with , and the level of definability , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain local search problems defined by functions of some level of the polynomial time hierarchy , and different bounds to the cost function . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we start with the @xmath5-definable functions of @xmath6 , we obtain a local search problem defined by properties in @xmath8 , where the cost function is bounded by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by following the canonical path through the search problem which starts at the initial value and iterates the neighbourhood function , we obtain a path of polynomial length , which describes a procedure in @xmath8 to compute a witness .    other research related to our investigations is a paper by buss @xcite which also makes use of the paris - wilkie translation to obtain witnessing results by giving uniform descriptions of translated proofs . </S>",
    "<S> however , buss approach does not explicitely involve cut - elimination . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic ordinal analysis @xcite characterises the heights of propositional proof trees obtained via the paris - wilkie translation and cut - reduction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is not surprising that the bounds obtained by dynamic ordinal analysis coincide with the bounds on cost functions we are exploiting here .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential of our approach to the characterisations of definable search problems via notation systems is that it may lead to characterisations of so far uncharacterised definable search problems , most notably the @xmath53-definable search problems in @xmath6 for @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> proof systems    let @xmath55 be a set . </S>",
    "<S> the set of all subsets of @xmath55 will be denoted by @xmath56 , the set of all finite subsets of @xmath55 will be denoted by @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath58 be a set ( of _ formulae _ ) , @xmath59 a binary relation on @xmath58 ( _ identity between formulae _ ) , and @xmath60 a function ( _ rank _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> a _ </S>",
    "<S> sequent _ over @xmath61 is a finite subset of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath62 as syntactic variables to denote sequents . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath63 we denote the set @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> we usually write @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> we always write @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> we repeat standard buchholz notation for proof systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a _ proof system @xmath71 over @xmath61 _ is given by    * a set of formal expressions called _ inference symbols _ </S>",
    "<S> ( syntactic variable @xmath72 ) ; * for each inference symbol @xmath72 an ordinal @xmath73 , a sequent @xmath74 and a family of sequents @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> proof systems may have inference symbols of the form @xmath76 for @xmath77 ; these are called `` cut inference symbols '' and their use will ( in definition  [ def : quasi - derivations ] ) be measured by the @xmath78-cut rank .    by writing </S>",
