    "recently a lot of activity has been dedicated to various studies of the regge trajectories  @xcite .",
    "some researchers deal with the improvement and extension of the existing fits to hadronic total cross sections by including , apart from the slopes and intercepts of degenerate or non - degenerate linear regge trajectories , also the relevant chew - frautschi plots  @xcite .",
    "the most complete and updated chew - frautschi plots for various ( linear ) trajectories can be found in paper  @xcite .",
    "the essential role of the non - linearity was recognized and scrutinized in the papers  @xcite , where studies of the analytic and asymptotic properties of the trajectories were also performed .",
    "the connection of the regge trajectories with dynamical models , based on non - relativistic potentials , hadronic strings , dual models etc . was studied recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic problem in constructing regge trajectories is to combine the nearly linear rise of the real part in the whole range of observed resonances with the presence of a sizable imaginary part .",
    "the combination of these properties in a single analytic function seems to be difficult , if not impossible , unless the linear part stops rising at larger values of the argument .",
    "this is true for the model we present below .    besides the experimental evidence , the dominant idea about the continuous rising linear trajectories found strong support from the narrow - resonance ( e.g. veneziano ) dual models , later replaced by hadronic strings .",
    "the  narrow resonance width \" was treated in those models as an approximation , where resonances widths are considered negligible in comparison with the spacing between the neighbors .",
    "the data do not support this idea , thus ruling out the concept of continuously rising linear trajectories .",
    "exchange degeneracy ( exd ) of the regge trajectories ( and the residues ) with opposite signatures is an approximate symmetry based both on observations and theoretical speculations ( the quark model , @xmath13 symmetry , duality ) .",
    "it is attractive as it relates various objects ( trajectories , spectra of particles , residues , cross sections ) reducing thus the number of the free parameters .",
    "the extent to which this symmetry is violated has been ( and is still ) debated ever since this symmetry was discovered .",
    "it depends on the considered reaction ( trajectory ) and the required precision ( at the cost of the number of the free parameters introduced ) . in our analysis",
    "we consider both cases - exact exd as well as its violation .",
    "there are two basic theoretical restrictions , which must be satisfied by regge trajectories - the threshold and asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the behaviour at the threshold is determined by unitarity and was studied in refs .",
    "on the other hand , only bounds exist on the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectories .",
    "analyticity sets an upper bound  @xcite and there are some plausible arguments  @xcite in favour of a stronger upper bound .",
    "they suggest a square root asymptotic behaviour on the physical sheet , @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , implying , as we shall see , that the real part of the trajectories is bounded by a constant , i.e. that resonances  terminate \" at some point .    in the present paper we construct an explicit model for light unflavored mesonic trajectories satisfying the above properties ,",
    "i.e. our model has correct threshold and asymptotic behaviour and fits the data on both the masses and widths of the observed mesonic resonances .",
    "we did not include baryonic resonances , whose widths seem to show a regularity , @xmath16 , not shared by mesonic resonances  @xcite .",
    "we apply our analysis of the meson trajectories to both the positive ( particles spectra ) and negative ( scattering region ) values of their arguments ( we denote it by @xmath17 , although our results are crossing symmetric in the mandelstam variables @xmath18 ) by fitting the parameters of the @xmath19 exchange degenerate trajectory to @xmath1 charge - exchange reaction data as in  @xcite .",
    "although various aspects of mesonic trajectories have been already studied and clarified in several papers  @xcite we are not aware of any complete and coherent solution of the problem , satisfying the correct threshold behaviour and fitting the widths of the mesonic trajectories .",
    "the properties of the trajectories following from analyticity and unitarity have been discussed in refs .  @xcite . in the complex @xmath17-plane",
    "the trajectory @xmath20 has only right - hand branch lines apart from branch points at the intersection with another singularity in the @xmath21plane .",
    "the requirement that there are no crossing poles and that @xmath20 is bounded for @xmath22 , leads to a dispersion relation of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 since the pole must lie in the upper half @xmath25-plane .",
    "in other words , no complex singularity of the partial wave exists for real @xmath25 .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath20 for @xmath22 follows from the assumption that the amplitude @xmath26 is bounded by a polynomial in @xmath27 and @xmath17 .",
    "this restriction is equivalent to the condition that the amplitude , in the regge form , should have no essential singularity at infinity in the cut plane .",
    "the condition that @xmath28 is bounded by a constant , for @xmath29 , leads to @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 an arbitrary constant .",
    "equation  ( [ a2 ] ) implies that @xmath28 can not be exactly linear in @xmath17 but it does not give any information on the deviation from linearity unless a specific model has been selected for the imaginary part @xmath33 .",
    "unitarity requires the threshold behaviour @xmath34 as shown in ref .",
    "for example , the first right - hand branch point will be at @xmath35 for the @xmath0 trajectory , and @xmath36 for the @xmath37 . to build an explicit model we must constrain the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectory and find a rule to determine the contribution of several thresholds to @xmath33 .",
    "we borrow both properties of the model from ref .",
    "first , we assume the square - root asymptotic on the physical sheet @xmath38 which satisfies the condition ( [ b2 ] ) and is realized in dual models  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we assume additivity of threshold contributions @xmath39 where @xmath40 has only one threshold branch point on the physical sheet .",
    "we require this hypothesis , which seems to be plausible , in order to set up a completely soluble model ; at least we are not aware of a reasonable alternative . contrary to  @xcite , we consider in the following only thresholds determined from pions and other mesonic resonances .",
    "we start from a simple analytical model , where the imaginary part of the trajectory is chosen as a sum of the single threshold terms @xmath41 with the correct asymptotic and threshold behaviour . in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) all @xmath42 s are positive  @xcite . it should be stressed that this choice is a crude approximation to the complexity of the true imaginary part .",
    "for example , the exponent @xmath43 should be a continuous function of @xmath17 .    from the dispersion relation for the trajectory , @xmath44 where @xmath45 means the cauchy principal value of the integral",
    ", the real part can be easily calculated  @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath46 we get : @xmath47 @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) we can get the slope @xmath49 @xmath50 since the derivatives of the @xmath51-functions in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) cancel .",
    "equations  ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) determine the width of the resonances through the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the width of the resonance and @xmath32 is its mass .",
    "suppose now that there is a threshold , higher than all resonances , at the position @xmath54 and with coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "this threshold will contribute to the real part and to the slope , but not to the imaginary part in the resonance region .",
    "its relevance to the real part of the trajectories and to the widths of the resonance will become clear in the following .",
    "fits of the unknown parameters will be presented and discussed in the next section .",
    "we only notice that eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) gives the complete real part of the trajectory , both in the time - like and in the space - like regions .",
    "of particular interest is the behaviour of the trajectory above @xmath54 . from eqs .",
    "( [ g2]-[i2 ] ) we can see that for @xmath56 the @xmath57 reaches a saturation point and stays nearly constant .",
    "the feature of the real part of trajectory , namely @xmath28 tends to constant , when @xmath29 , means that the number of resonances lying on it is limited . as noticed before ,",
    "approximate linearity in the region where experimental data require it , can be attained by introducing a threshold higher than the masses of all known relevant resonances .",
    "the highest threshold entails two unknown parameters , its position @xmath54 and the coefficient @xmath55 , and contributes to eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) only above the resonance region . it can be considered as an effective threshold .",
    "this fact suggests an iterative method for the fitting procedure .    a rough estimate of @xmath58 ,",
    "can be obtained from a linear trajectory , adapted to the experimental data . in this way",
    "we fix also the lowest order value of the slope .",
    "intercepts and slopes of mesonic trajectories can be taken , for example , from the accurate analysis in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lowest @xmath59 threshold we will consider in the following the open channels , where one , or both pions , are substituted by mesonic resonances . once the thresholds @xmath60 have been chosen , in accordance with the considered trajectory , eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) can be used to fit the unknown parameters @xmath42 from the experimental masses and widths of the resonances .",
    "then , the fit of the spins of the resonances fix the remaining parameters , @xmath61 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 , from eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) . in the minimization procedure",
    "an error can be associated with the spin of a resonance in terms of the error in the mass and the estimated errors for intercept and slope  @xcite .",
    "in such a way we get the first order correction to the trajectory .",
    "iterations can be performed by repeating the previous steps till a stable output is obtained .",
    "= 17.9 cm    the scarcity of the available experimental data , forces an _ a priori _ choice of the thresholds . in all cases with positive g - parity , the @xmath59 threshold will be present , hence @xmath62 gev@xmath63 for @xmath0 and @xmath64 trajectories . after a large number of trials we have chosen @xmath65 near 2 gev@xmath63 for all trajectories . to be precise , for the @xmath66 trajectories",
    ", we set @xmath67 gev@xmath63 that corresponds to a @xmath68 threshold .",
    "the position of the last threshold , @xmath69 , does not influence sensibly the result .",
    "hence , if the @xmath70 prefers a very high @xmath54 ( we will see later that this is the case for @xmath0 and @xmath71 trajectories ) , we set @xmath72 gev@xmath63 .",
    "we have tried to insert extra thresholds in a large variety of ways without finding any improvement . by fixing the thresholds",
    "we limit the capability of the model in reproducing the experimental data , but , as we will see in the following , this still allows us to obtain a good agreement with experiment .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath0 and @xmath73 trajectories .",
    "in fact only the exd @xmath19 trajectory provides for a large set of input data : ten plus two , which need confirmation . in our model @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath73 have different thresholds , with different g - parity , and exchange degeneracy is necessarily broken .",
    "experimentally however the breaking is small and not easily detectable in the real part . as a first attempt",
    ", we keep all the resonances on an exd @xmath19 trajectory and fit them with five correction cycles .",
    "data for the resonances @xmath74 and @xmath75 are taken from the review of particle physics  @xcite and the zeroth order trajectory is written as @xmath76 . notice that @xmath75 needs confirmation and",
    "@xmath77 has been omitted from the summary table .",
    "thresholds @xmath78 and @xmath65 are fixed as explained above , @xmath54 prefers to stay as large as possible and is fixed at 30 gev@xmath63 . in the output",
    "the intercept of the degenerate @xmath19 trajectory increased to @xmath79 while @xmath80 .",
    "[ fig1](a , b ) show , as continuous lines , @xmath28 , @xmath33 and @xmath81 for the exchange degenerate @xmath19 . in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) , the widths of the resonances are affected to a larger extent by a breaking of exd . to substantiate this statement we performed a new fit , keeping only the @xmath0 resonances , with the same thresholds .",
    "while the real part of the trajectory does not change appreciably , we obtain a good agreement for the widths as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "= 17.9 cm    the study of the @xmath64-trajectory becomes , in this approach , important under many aspects .",
    "analyses of total cross sections depend crucially on its intercept .",
    "moreover , exd must be badly broken since attempts to describe together @xmath64 and @xmath37 in this model failed , supporting recent findings  @xcite .",
    "the exd violation can be understood by noticing that the width of the @xmath82 is only four percent of the width of the @xmath83 , and it will be difficult to find an analytic function satisfying these constraints . starting from the resonances @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which needs confirmation  @xcite , and the zeroth order trajectory @xmath86 , with errors quoted in  @xcite , we get , with the higher threshold @xmath87 gev@xmath63 , a final intercept @xmath88 . at the end of 5th cycle ,",

    "[ fig2 ] triangles symbolize @xmath82 and @xmath92 : these resonances are not included in the fit , but their masses and widths are drawn to show once again , that exd breaking affects more the widths than the real part of the trajectories .    the real part of the degenerate @xmath19 trajectory has been evaluated also for negative values of @xmath17 , in the scattering region . from eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) a quasi - linear trajectory results with a very small positive curvature . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare our result with an effective trajectory obtained by fitting pion charge - exchange scattering data  @xcite . only for @xmath93 gev@xmath63",
    "the agreement with the experimental points is very good .",
    "the curvature of the analytic trajectory has the correct sign , but is not sufficient at large @xmath94 .",
    "a possible solution at large negative @xmath17 has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fit to the existing data  @xcite of the differential cross section @xmath95 for the process @xmath96 reproduces correctly the experimental data .",
    "however , in  @xcite the trajectory has logarithmic asymptotics and it would be difficult to construct a completely solvable analytic model in this case .",
    "in this paper we attempt to systematize the light unflavored mesonic trajectories by simultaneous fits to the masses of the resonances and their widths",
    ". a deeper understanding of exd plays an important role in this program .",
    "in addition to the known properties of the s - matrix , analyticity and unitarity , other assumptions are needed in order to have a completely soluble model .",
    "the imaginary part of a trajectory depends on the presence of one or more branch points , related to corresponding thresholds , for positive values of the argument .",
    "the first hypothesis is that these thresholds are additive .",
    "moreover , analyticity places an upper bound on the asymptotic behaviour of a trajectory .",
    "the second assumption fixes a particular asymptotic form compatible with this constraint .",
    "these two assumptions , regarding only the imaginary part of the trajectory , determine the analytic structure of the model .    the parameters of the model , the position of the thresholds and their weight together with the intercept of the trajectory , have been determined for the exd @xmath97 trajectories and for the @xmath0 and @xmath64 alone , and the exd violation has been discussed and explained in the context of the model .    due to the asymptotic behaviour of the real part , only a finite number of resonances may lie on a given trajectory in this model .",
    "however , for the examples considered here the bound on the resonance masses is too high for putting any constraint on a future search of new mesonic states . for the @xmath64 trajectory in fact ,",
    "a higher effective threshold will be probably present . in this respect",
    "our approach differs from the one in ref .",
