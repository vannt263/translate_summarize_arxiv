    "one of the key questions studied in the mathematical analysis of evolutionary partial differential equations ( pdes ) is the existence of solutions , both locally and globally in time .",
    "the motivation is that , in order to justify the application of different pdes as models of natural phenomena , these equations must be guaranteed to possess meaningful solutions for physically relevant data .",
    "in addition , characterization of the extreme behavior which can be exhibited by the solutions of different pdes is also relevant for our understanding of the worst - case scenarios which can be realized in the actual physical systems these pdes describe .",
    "these two types of questions can be investigated by studying the time evolution of suitable sobolev norms of the solutions .",
    "in particular , should a given sobolev norm of the solution become unbounded at a certain time due to a spontaneous formation of a singularity , this will signal that the solution is no longer defined in that sobolev space ; this loss of regularity is referred to as `` blow - up '' .",
    "an example of an evolutionary pde model with widespread applications whose global - in - time existence remains an open problem is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) navier - stokes system describing the motion of viscous incompressible fluids .",
    "questions of existence of solutions to this system are usually studied for problems defined on unbounded or a periodic domains @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath1 or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . unlike the two - dimensional ( 2d ) problem where",
    "smooth solutions are known to exist globally in time @xcite , in 3d existence of such solutions has been established for short times only @xcite .",
    "establishing global existence of smooth solutions in 3d is one of the key open questions in mathematical fluid mechanics and , in fact , its importance for mathematics in general has been recognized by the clay mathematics institute as one of its `` millennium problems '' @xcite .",
    "suitable weak solutions were shown to exist in 3d for arbitrarily long times @xcite , however , such solutions may not be regular in addition to being nonunique .",
    "similar questions also remain open for the 3d euler equation @xcite . while many angles of attack on this problem have been pursued in mathematical analysis , one research direction which has received a lot of attention focuses on the evolution of the _ enstrophy _ @xmath4 which for an incompressible velocity field @xmath5 at a given time @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , where `` @xmath8 '' means `` equals to by definition '' , i.e. , it is proportional to the square of the @xmath9 norm of the vorticity @xmath10 .",
    "the reason why this quantity is interesting in the context of the 3d navier - stokes equation is due to a conditional regularity result proved by foias and temam @xcite who showed that the solution remains smooth ( i.e. , stays in a suitable gevrey regularity class ) as long as the enstrophy remains bounded , i.e. , for all @xmath6 such that @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , a loss of regularity must be manifested by the enstrophy becoming infinite . while there exist many different conditional regularity results , this one is particularly useful from the computational point of view as it involves an easy to evaluate quadratic quantity .",
    "analogous conditional regularity results , although involving other norms of vorticity , were also derived for the 3d euler equation ( e.g. , the celebrated beale - kato - majda ( bkm ) criterion @xcite ) .    in order to assess whether or not the enstrophy can blow up in finite time one",
    "needs to study its instantaneous rate of growth @xmath12 which can be estimated as @xcite @xmath13 for some @xmath14 ( hereafter @xmath15 will denote a generic positive constant whose actual value may vary between different estimates ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , see also @xcite , that this estimate is in fact sharp , in the sense that , for each @xmath16 there exists an incompressible velocity field @xmath17 with @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 .",
    "the fields @xmath17 were found by numerically solving a family of variational maximization problems for different values of @xmath20 ( details of this approach will be discussed further below ) .",
    "however , the corresponding _ finite - time _ estimate obtained by integrating in time takes the form @xmath21 and it is clear that based on this estimate alone it is not possible to ensure a prior boundedness of enstrophy in time .",
    "thus , the question of finite - time blow - up may be recast in terms of whether or not it is possible to find initial data @xmath22 such that the corresponding flow evolution saturates the right - hand side of .",
    "we emphasize that for this to happen the rate of growth of enstrophy given in would need to be sustained over a _",
    "finite _ window of time , rather than just instantaneously , a behavior which has not been observed so far @xcite ( in fact , a singularity may arise in finite time even with enstrophy growth occurring at a slower sustained rate of @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "the question of the maximum enstrophy growth has been tackled in computational studies , usually using initial data chosen in an ad - hoc manner , producing no evidence of a finite - time blow - up in the 3d navier - stokes system @xcite .",
    "however , for the 3d euler system the situation is different and the latest computations reported in @xcite indicate the possibility of a finite - time blow - up .",
    "a new direction in the computational studies of extreme behavior in fluid flow models relies on the use of variational optimization approaches to systematically search for the most singular initial data .",
    "this research program , initiated in @xcite , aims to probe the sharpness , or realizability , of certain fundamental estimates analogous to and and defined for various hydrodynamic models such as the one - dimensional ( 1d ) viscous burgers equation and the 2d/3d navier - stokes system .",
    "since the 1d viscous burgers equation and the 2d navier - stokes system are both known to be globally well - posed in the classical sense @xcite , there is no question about the finite - time blow - up in these problems .",
    "however , the relevant estimates for the growth of certain sobolev norms , both instantaneously and in finite time , are obtained using very similar functional - analysis tools as estimates and , hence the question of their sharpness is quite pertinent as it may offer valuable insights about estimates .",
    "an estimate such as or is declared `` sharp '' , if for increasing values of @xmath25 ( or @xmath20 ) the quantity on the left - hand side ( lhs ) exhibits the same power - law dependence on @xmath25 ( or @xmath20 ) as the upper bound on the right - hand side ( rhs ) .    assuming the domain @xmath26 to be periodic , we write the 1d fractional burgers equation as    [ eq : fburgers ] @xmath27    for some viscosity coefficient @xmath28 and with @xmath29 denoting the fractional laplacian which for sufficiently regular functions @xmath30 defined on a periodic domain and @xmath31 is defined via the relation @xmath32(\\xi )   = \\left({2\\pi|\\xi|}\\right)^{2\\alpha } \\mathcal{f}[v](\\xi ) , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] where @xmath33(\\xi)$ ] represents the fourier transform .",
    "we note that in the special cases of @xmath34 and @xmath35 the fractional laplacian reduces to , respectively , the identity operator and the ( negative ) classical laplacian .",
    "we now define the associated    [ eq : eea ] @xmath36    it should be noted that @xmath37 and @xmath38 become equivalent when @xmath39 , which is a consequence of the relation @xmath40 following from the properties of the fractional laplacian .    evidently , when @xmath35 , system reduces to the classical burgers equation for which a number of relevant results have already been obtained in the seminal studies @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these investigations that the rate of growth of the classical enstrophy @xmath37 is subject to the following bound @xmath41 by considering a family of variational optimization problems @xmath42 parameterized by @xmath43 , in which @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is the sobolev space of functions defined on the periodic interval @xmath46 and possessing square - integrable derivatives of up to ( fractional ) order @xmath47 @xcite , it was then demonstrated that estimate is in fact sharp .",
    "remarkably , the authors in @xcite were able to solve problem analytically in closed form ( although the structure of the maximizers is quite complicated and involves special functions ) . when using the instantaneously optimal initial states @xmath48 obtained for different values of @xmath20 as the initial data @xmath49 for burgers system with @xmath35 , the maximum enstrophy growth @xmath50 achieved during the resulting flow evolution was proportional to @xmath20 .",

    "it was found that the maximum finite - time enstrophy growth @xmath56 .",
    "it is thus significantly weaker than the maximum growth stipulated by estimate in the limit @xmath57 , demonstrating that this estimate is _ not _ sharp and may be improved ( which remains an open problem ) .",
    "these observations were rigorously justified by pelinovsky in @xcite using the laplace method combined with the cole - hopf transformation . in a related study @xcite ,",
    "a dynamical - systems approach was used to reveal a self - similar structure of the maximizing solution in the limit of large enstrophy .",
    "this asymptotic solution was shown to have the form of a viscous shock wave superimposed on a linear rarefaction wave . in that study",
    "similar maximizing solutions were also constructed on the entire real line .",
    "the question how the maximum finite - time growth of enstrophy in the burgers system may be affected by additive stochastic noise was addressed in @xcite .",
    "using an approach based on monte - carlo sampling , it was shown that the stochastic excitation does not decrease the extreme enstrophy growth , defined in a suitable probabilistic setting , as compared to what is observed in the deterministic case .",
    "the question of the extreme behavior in 2d navier - stokes flows was addressed in @xcite . since on 2d unbounded and doubly - periodic domains",
    "the enstrophy may not increase , the relevant quantity in this setting is the _ palinstrophy _ defined as the @xmath9 norm of the vorticity gradient . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , again by numerically solving suitably defined variational maximization problems , that the available bounds on the rate of growth of palinstrophy are sharp and that , somewhat surprisingly , the corresponding maximizing vorticity fields give rise to flow evolutions which also saturate the estimates for the palinstrophy growth in finite time .",
    "thus , paradoxically , as far as the sharpness of the finite - time estimates is concerned , the situation in 2d is more satisfactory than in 1d .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to advance the research program outlined above by considering the extreme behavior possible in the fractional burgers system when @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the reason why this problem is interesting from the point of view of this research program is that , as discussed in @xcite , the fractional burgers system is globally well - posed when @xmath59 and exhibits a finite - time blow - up in the supercritical regime when @xmath60 ( it was initially demonstrated in @xcite that the blow - up occurs in the sobolev space @xmath44 , @xmath61 , and this results was later refined in @xcite where it was shown that under certain conditions on the initial data the blow - up occurs in @xmath62 for all @xmath60 ; eventual regularization of solutions after blow - up was discussed in @xcite ) . thus , the behavior changes fundamentally when the fractional dissipation exponent @xmath63 is reduced below @xmath64 ( this aspect was also illustrated in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there is also a certain similarity with the 3d navier - stokes system which is known to be globally well - posed in the classical sense in the presence of fractional dissipation with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "our specific objectives are therefore twofold :    * first , we will obtain upper bounds on the rate of growth of enstrophy generalizing estimate to the fractional dissipation case with @xmath58 $ ] in ; this will be done separately for both the classical and fractional enstrophy , cf .   and , and *",
    "secondly , we will probe the sharpness , in the sense defined above , of these new estimates by numerically solving corresponding variational maximization problems ; in this latter step we will also provide insights about the structure of the optimal states saturating different bounds .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we derive upper bounds on the rate of growth of the classical and fractional enstrophy as functions of the fractional dissipation exponent @xmath63 , then in section [ sec : method ] we provide details of the computational approach designed to probe the sharpness of these bounds , whereas in section [ sec : results ] we present numerical results obtained for the two cases ; discussion and final conclusions are deferred to section [ sec : final ] .",

    "we observe that , interestingly , as @xmath63 decreases the sharp fronts in the maximizers disappear and are replaced with oscillations ( figures [ fig : tuea](a , c , e ) ) .",

    "we see that the maximizers for which @xmath222 have a simpler structure and for all considered values of @xmath223 and @xmath67 are essentially indistinguishable from @xmath224 for some @xmath225 .",
    "the relation @xmath217 versus @xmath67 ( the upper branch shown in figure [ fig : ra](a , b ) ) reveals similar properties as observed in the case of the classical enstrophy discussed in section [ sec : resultsr ] , namely , an initially steep growth followed by saturation with a power - law behavior when @xmath226 . performing local least - squares fits to these relations with the formula @xmath227 , as described in section [ sec : resultsr ] , we can calculate how the actual prefactors @xmath228 and exponents @xmath229 depend on @xmath67 and these results are shown in figure [ fig : fita](a , b ) , where we have also indicated , for @xmath121 $ ] , the predictions of estimate .",

    "we see in figure [ fig : sigmagammaa](b ) that for @xmath230 the numerically obtained exponents @xmath229 match the exponents @xmath130 from estimate and a difference appears for @xmath231 which grows as @xmath63 decreases . for @xmath232 the numerically determined exponents @xmath229 are a decreasing function of @xmath63 which saturates at a constant value of approximately @xmath233 when @xmath234 . at the same time",
    ", the prefactors @xmath228 obtained numerically are by a few orders of magnitude smaller than the prefactors predicted by estimate over the entire range of @xmath63 , although they do exhibit qualitatively similar trends with @xmath63 . for @xmath235 $ ] , which is outside the range of validity of estimate , the numerically obtained exponents @xmath229 are constant , indicating that , somewhat surprisingly , in this range @xmath217 does not depend on the fractional dissipation exponent @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding numerically obtained prefactors @xmath228 reveal a decreasing trend with @xmath63 .",
    "we add that these trends are accompanied by the maximizers @xmath151 becoming more regular as @xmath63 decreases ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : tuea ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the exponent @xmath130 in estimate is sharp over a part of the range of validity of this estimate and appears to overestimate the actual rate of growth of fractional enstrophy for smaller values of @xmath63 . over the range of @xmath63 where the exponent @xmath130 is sharp , the prefactor @xmath132",
    "may be improved .",
    "while the estimates on the rate of growth of the classical and fractional enstrophy obtained in theorems [ dedt ] and [ deadt ] are not much different from similar results already available in the literature @xcite , the key finding of the present study is that these estimates are in fact sharp , in the sense that for different @xmath63 the exponents @xmath129 and @xmath130 in and capture the correct power - law dependence of the maximum growth rates @xmath205 and @xmath217 on @xmath25 and @xmath67 , respectively ( the second estimate was found to be sharp only over a part of the range of @xmath63 for which it is defined ) .",
    "this was demonstrated by computationally solving suitably defined constrained optimization problems and then showing that the maximizers obtained under constraints on @xmath25 and @xmath67 saturate the upper bounds in the estimates for different values of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the conclusion is that the mathematical analysis on which theorems [ dedt ] and [ deadt ] are based may not be fundamentally improved , other than a refinement of exponent @xmath130 in for @xmath236 and an improvement of the prefactors in and .    in regard to the maximum rate of growth of the classical enstrophy , it was found that for @xmath237 the exponent @xmath129 in estimate becomes unbounded , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmagamma1](b ) , which together with the computational evidence obtained for @xmath238 $ ] suggests that @xmath12 may be unbounded for @xmath63 in this range .",
    "this would indicate that for @xmath238 $ ] system is not even locally well posed in @xmath239 .",
    "concerning the maximum rate of growth of the fractional enstrophy , a surprising result was obtained for @xmath240 , where the exponent in the upper bound on @xmath241 was found to be independent of @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmagammaa](b ) ) .",
    "this indicates that , unlike in the case of the classical enstrophy , in this range of @xmath63 the problem does not become more singular with the decrease of @xmath63 and this is in fact also reflected in the maximizers @xmath151 becoming more regular as @xmath221 .    on the methodological side , it ought to be emphasized that gradient - based iterations may only identify _ local _ maximizers and in general it is not possible to ascertain whether these maximizers are also global",
    "however , our careful search based on the continuation approach ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : continuation ] ) and , independently , using several different initial guesses @xmath145 did not reveal any additional maximizers ( other than the maximizers obtained via a trivial rescaling of the solutions as discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "an exception to this was the solution of the maximization problem for small @xmath63 and @xmath67 where a branch of maximizers such that @xmath222 was also found .",
    "the presence of this additional branch appears related to the degenerate nature of the maximization problem which for @xmath180 has an uncountable infinity of trivial solutions ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : a0 ] ) .",
    "as regards the research program discussed in introduction , the key finding of the present study is that exponents @xmath129 in the upper bound on @xmath12 have the same dependence on @xmath63 and remain sharp in the subcritical , critical and parts of the supercritical regime .",
    "thus , the loss of global well - posedness as @xmath63 is reduced to values below @xmath64 can not be detected based on the instantaneous rate of growth of enstrophy @xmath12 .",
