    "the hysteresis loop ( hl ) has been first studied more than century ago @xcite . however , the understanding of this process in thin magnetic films as well as in bulk magnets is still rather poor .",
    "many efforts have been devoted recently to prediction ( see @xcite ) and experimental verification ( see @xcite , @xcite ) of the scaling behavior of the hysteresis loop area ( hla ) as a function of the applied magnetic field frequency and amplitude for thin magnetic films ( for a brief review of hla scaling results see @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling behavior of the hla have been first reported in the pioneer work @xcite for 3d magnets . while there exists an extended literature on the hysteresis of 3d magnets ,",
    "the properties of hl in 2d systems are much less known .",
    "there are only few articles devoted to the hl in ultrathin ferromagnetic films @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , though the hysteresis effects have been found as a side effect in many others ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "critical exponents found in the experiments with thin films vary dramatically for different materials ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) and probably for different regimes .",
    "different authors disagree each to other ( see the already cited articles @xcite and @xcite ) and also disagree with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "several years ago mean field type models with single @xcite or many @xcite relaxation times have been applied to analyze experimental data .",
    "the authors of @xcite assumed that the hl was controlled by the nucleation process .",
    "these authors predicted the logarithmic dependence of the coercive field @xmath0 on the rate of the applied magnetic field @xmath1 . in a recent experiment @xcite it was found that the hla depends on frequency of applied field as a power with a small exponent ( @xmath2 ) or , possibly , logarithmically .",
    "however , in the framework of the same approach the hla must behave also as logarithm of @xmath3 with the same coefficient ( exponent ) .",
    "this dependence has never been observed in the experiment .",
    "therefore , we propose a new analysis of such a hl in this article .    the purpose of this article is to formulate a rather general approach to magnetization reversal mechanisms and to indicate several important measurable characteristics of the hl besides of the hla .",
    "we will see that these characteristics are governed by two dimensionless parameters combined from the field frequency @xmath4 , its amplitude @xmath5 and characteristics of the magnetic material . everywhere in what follows",
    "we assume that the external field varies harmonically in time @xmath6 .",
    "the hysteresis behavior may have various origin .",
    "it can be mediated by nucleation process , by the dw propagation or simply by retardation of the magnetization due to fluctuations .",
    "we consider all these mechanisms and establish conditions at which one of them is dominant .",
    "defects play an important role in the dw propagation .",
    "they create a finite threshold value @xmath7 of static magnetic field necessary for the dw depinning .",
    "the threshold field @xmath8 in the dynamical problem can differ substantially from @xmath7 .",
    "we find that in a medium with defects the moving dw , passing rare extended defects , may form bubbles of reversed spins .",
    "these bubbles play an important role as prepared nuclei in the next half - cycle of the magnetization reversal .    in this article",
    "we consider magnets of the ising ( uniaxial ) symmetry .",
    "their properties may be very different depending on the strength of the anisotropy .",
    "in the experimentally studied films the anisotropy was very weak . in this case",
    "the domain wall width is large in comparison to the lattice constant . on the contrary , in the original ising model the anisotropy",
    "is assumed to be large and dw width @xmath9 is simply the lattice constant .",
    "however , these different models become equivalent after a simple rescaling : the dw width should be accepted as a new elementary ( cut - off ) length .",
    "it means that we consider a spin cluster of the linear size @xmath9 as a new elementary spin .",
    "this approach allows us to apply the ising model supplied with the glauber dynamics for numerical simulations .",
    "peculiarities of the two - dimensional situation are : much higher mobility of the dw as well as much stronger fluctuations .",
    "this makes the experimental situations as well as the theoretical description much more diverse than those for a 3d magnet .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ dw ] and [ line ] we consider the individual dw motion .",
    "equation of motion is formulated and justified in sect.[dw ] .",
    "it is solved in sect.[line ] . in the same section",
    "we introduce characteristic fields @xmath10 , the hla @xmath11 , find the scaling arguments and analyze several limiting regimes in which simple power scaling is valid . in sect.[traps ] the process of the bubble formation is studied .",
    "sect.[nucleation ] is devoted to the hl controlled by the nucleation process .",
    "the hl driven by strong magnetization fluctuations , especially near the curie point , is considered in sect.[adiabatic ] .",
    "numerical simulations of the hl and the domain structures for the 2d ising model with glauber dynamics which supports results obtained in sect.[line ] , sect.[traps ] are presented in sect.[mc ] . in sect.[conclusions ] we summarize our results and compare them to the experimental data . in the rest of this article we use the notation @xmath3 for magnetic field , @xmath12 for magnetization and @xmath13 for the total magnetic moment of a magnet .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , our starting point is an impure ferromagnet with either weak or strong ising anisotropy . the soft spin version of the system is then given by a @xmath14 model with a bare domain wall width @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the original lattice spacing",
    ". the imperfections in the model may be in principle either of random bond ( i.e. random @xmath17 ) or random field type .",
    "we will argue below , that in the region we are mainly interested in , namely above the depinning threshold , both types of impurities act essentially as random field impurities .    as it was shown by bausch et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite@xcite ) , equation of motion for a domain wall without overhangs can be written in a following way @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the interface position and @xmath20 . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the domain wall mobility and stiffness , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the external magnetic field and @xmath25 is the magnetization.finally @xmath26 denotes the random force generated by the impurities .    for broad domain walls @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the dimensionality of the wall . for narrow walls @xmath22 depends in general on @xmath29 , and the disorder strength in a complicated way @xcite .",
    "the random fields @xmath30 generated by imperfections is assumed to be gaussian distributed and short range correlated with @xmath31 and    @xmath32    here @xmath33 denotes a delta - function smeared out over a distance @xmath9 . as was first argued by narayan and fisher @xcite , in the region above the depinning threshold",
    "random bond and random field impurities act in a similar way .",
    "this can be seen most easily from an example of two ratcheted potential ( see figure 1 ) , one for random bond and another for random field impurities .",
    "although the potential @xmath34 in the random field case ( figure 1b ) has fluctuations which scale like @xmath35 , it leads to the same random forces as the random field potential ( figure 1a ) which shows of order one fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves throughout this paper to the case of random field impurities .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the disorder is weak , i.e. that the condition @xmath36 is fulfilled .    for @xmath37 , @xmath38 and",
    "the equation of motion takes the form considered previously @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "below we summarize some of the results found in @xcite@xcite : since the disorder is weak ( see ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) , the interface is essentially flat on length scales @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the so - called larkin length . on larger scales",
    "the wall can adapt to the disorder and , as a result , it gets pinned for driving fields @xmath41 with @xmath42 for the pinning threshold .",
    "if @xmath3 exceeds @xmath7 , the wall starts to move .",
    "for @xmath43 the influence of the disorder is weak and the velocity is proportional to the driving field @xmath44 corrections to this relation can be considered in the framework of high - velocity expansion which can be expressed as a power series in @xmath45 where @xmath46 is dynamical correlation length which diverges as @xmath47 ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the dynamical and the roughness exponent , respectively . outside the dynamical critical region ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    if the driving field @xmath3 is so small , that @xmath53 , the high - velocity expansion breaks down and a ( functional ) renormalization group calculation has to be applied @xcite .",
    "this leads to a renormalization of the mobility constant @xmath54 with @xmath55 after integrating out the interface fluctuations on the length scales @xmath56 , the effective equation of motion for the interface profile @xmath57 on large scales is given by @xmath58 here @xmath59 denotes the spatial and time average over scales @xmath46 and @xmath60 , respectively and @xmath61 is the renormalized random field which acts as a thermal noise . since the latter leads to an interface roughness characterized by the exponent @xmath62 , we may neglect the influence of the random field on these length scales .",
    "the mean velocity of the interface is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 take now non - trivial values , which can be calculated in by @xmath65-expansion in @xmath66 or determined numerically .",
    "for @xmath67 the @xmath65-expansion gives @xmath68 and @xmath69 and hence @xmath70 whereas the numerical values are @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite . to unify our results for the domain wall velocity we rewrite ( [ eq:6 ] ) , ( [ eq:9 ] ) as @xmath74    on the length scales @xmath75 the domain wall is rough @xmath76 bumps in the domain walls which emerge from random clusters heal on time scales @xmath77    however , on larger scales @xmath78 the random field acts merely as a thermal noise and the roughness exponent is reduced to @xmath79 and @xmath52 ( log ) in @xmath67 and @xmath80 dimensions , respectively .",
    "we start with description of a rectilinear domain wall motion . in previous section",
    "we demonstrated that the domain wall roughness can be ignored on a time scale @xmath81 .",
    "thus , locally the domain wall moves as a straight line . in some experiments",
    "only one domain wall survives ( see sect .",
    "7 ) . in this case",
    "the model problem of rectilinear domain wall motion is close to reality . in other cases",
    "this problem is an important part of more complex problem describing either local properties of domain wall motion or the order of magnitudes for the global motion .",
    "thus , we consider the motion of a rectilinear domain wall under the action of magnetic field antiparallel to the magnetization .",
    "we have mentioned already that the fluctuation bending of the domain wall can be neglected if the characteristic time of the process is much more than the bump healing time @xmath82 .",
    "this requirement suggests that @xmath83 .",
    "anyway , this requirement must be satisfied since , otherwise the average position of the domain wall almost does not change during half a period of oscillations .    the domain wall is assumed to be fixed at the left boundary of the sample @xmath84 at the initial moment .",
    "we will solve equation of motion ( [ eq:6 ] ) for domain wall coordinate for harmonically oscillating magnetic field @xmath85 .",
    "instead of integrating it over time , we integrate it over field by a following change of coordinates : @xmath86 after integration we find an expression for @xmath87 vs. magnetic field @xmath3 : @xmath88 this equation is correct for @xmath89 . for smaller value of @xmath3 the domain wall does not move : @xmath90 .",
    "equation ( [ z(h ) ] ) should be complemented by a prescription to change the sign of the square root each time as @xmath3 reaches its maximum or minimum value @xmath91 and by an initial condition @xmath84 at @xmath92 .",
    "the second necessary prescription is to substitute @xmath93 by @xmath94 when @xmath3 is negative . to transfer from the coordinate @xmath87 to the magnetic moment @xmath95 ,",
    "a following representation is useful : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the saturation magnetic moment .",
    "first of all we find two important boundary values for the amplitude @xmath5 which separate hysteresis loops of different shapes .",
    "the first of them is the dynamic threshold field @xmath8 , the smallest value of @xmath5 at which the domain walls reaches the right boundary of the sample @xmath98 . at @xmath99 the magnetization",
    "is not reversed fully and the hysteresis loop is asymmetric ( see fig [ fig : loop]a ) . at larger values of @xmath5",
    "the hysteresis loop is symmetric under inversion @xmath100 ( fig . [",

    "they concluded that @xmath266 with small exponents @xmath267 and very small exponent @xmath268 .",
    "both exponents depend on temperature .",
    "these conclusions are compatible with our result ( [ eq : a - a-1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , at such small values of exponents it is impossible to distinguish between the logarithmic dependence and the exponential dependence with a small exponent .",
    "our predictions @xmath269 and @xmath270 agree with the experimentally discovered linear temperature dependence of the exponent @xmath271 .",
    "it would be worthwhile to measure the frequency dependence of the dynamical threshold field @xmath8 .",
    "the fact of the existence of such a threshold has been observed in the same experiment .",
    "it should be noted that the value @xmath272 is not so small in the experiment @xmath273 .",
    "therefore we expect that our theory is correct with the accuracy 25% only . on the other hand ,",
    "the statement that there exists the power - like dependence of the hla on @xmath5 is not proved convincingly by this experiment since the interval of variation for @xmath5 was too small ( the amplitude changed about 10 times ) .",
    "so far we considered @xmath238 and @xmath243 as fixed values .",
    "this is correct if only one type of defects mediates the nucleation .",
    "more realistically these values are random .",
    "then the defects with the minimal ratio @xmath274 initiate the magnetization reversal process .    according to eqn.([eq : h - t - a ] ) @xmath8 becomes zero at very small frequencies @xmath275 .",
    "our theory is not valid for such a small frequency , but it reflects correctly the narrowing of the hl . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition is smeared over the interval of magnetic field @xmath276 .",
    "it is small in comparison to @xmath3 if @xmath277 . at a smaller amplitude @xmath5",
    "the reversal is possible , but fluctuations of magnetization grow rapidly and become of the order of magnetization itself . in principle , it is possible that the nucleation time is of the same order of magnitude that the time of domain wall propagation .",
    "however , since the nucleation time depends fastly on parameters , a small change of the regime makes one of the two times much larger than another .",
    "thus , presumably the nucleation mediated hysteresis loop has the rectangular shape , whereas a curved shape indicates that the hysteresis is associated with the domain wall propagation or with strong fluctuations of magnetization",
    ".    a reason for the rounding of the hl in the case of the nucleation controlled hysteresis can be that the sample is splitted into a number of magnetically disconnected grains with different @xmath238 and @xmath243 in each grain .",
    "then the shape of the hysteresis loop reflects the distribution function for the ratio @xmath278 .",
    "in the case of strong ising anisotropy the dynamic equation for magnetization @xmath12 in the continuum limit has the form : @xmath279 where @xmath280 is a free energy . in the adiabatic limit the total magnetization @xmath281 at the moment @xmath282 can be represented as @xmath283 where @xmath284 is",

    "the best numerical value for @xmath48 is @xmath305 ( for a modern review see @xcite and references therein ) . if @xmath306 and @xmath307 , the relaxation time is proportional to @xmath308 . for adiabaticity",
    "it is necessary that @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the saturation ( exchange ) field .",

    "( [ h - c - scale ] ) . otherwise @xmath321 .",
    "then an approximate solution of eqn .",
    "( [ m01 ] ) reads : @xmath322 corresponding results for the hla are as follows : @xmath323 @xmath324    though we can not calculate explicitly the hysteresis loop area in the opposite , anti - adiabatic regime @xmath325 , the dimensionality arguments lead to a necessary estimate .",
    "indeed , according to general equation ( [ area2 ] ) , its scaling dimensionality is @xmath326 where we have used the facts that @xmath4 and @xmath327 have the same dimensionality and that @xmath328 .",

    "its minimization over @xmath65 at fixed value of @xmath3 gives : @xmath334 for the exchange field about @xmath335 and external field about @xmath336 the nucleation time becomes of the order of @xmath337 .",

    "this conclusion explains the results of our numerical calculations for temperatures close to the curie point ( see section [ mc ] ) .",
    "in this section the process of magnetization reversal in a few monolayers thick magnetic film is modeled by analogous process in the two - dimensional ising model with the glauber dynamics . in simulation",

    "which process dominates depends on system parameters and its history . in this section",
    "we consider a limit of the nucleation time much smaller than the growth time .",

    "with the temperature decreasing , away from critical region the hla deviates strongly from the power - law behavior as it is follows from fig.[f7 ] .",
    "we expect that the hl changes its shape and characteristics from those dominated by domain wall propagation to those dominated by nucleation .",
    "the crossover behavior can not be described by a single power law .",
    "we studied main mechanisms of the hysteresis in a ferromagnet : the driven dw motion , nucleation and retardation in non - linear magnetization dynamics .",
    "each of them may be dominant at proper conditions .",
    "a process is dominant if it provides maximum value for the coercive field @xmath0 .    on the background of general theory of the interface motion in a random medium we studied the hysteresis process controlled by the dw motion .",
    "we introduced two dynamic threshold fields @xmath8 and @xmath105 corresponding to the occurrence of the full magnetization reversal and to the occurrence of the single - valued parts on the hysteresis curve respectively .",
    "these dynamical threshold fields are larger than the static threshold field @xmath7 which is required to start a motion of the dw .",
    "we established that @xmath8 and @xmath105 measured in units @xmath7 are functions of one dimensionless parameter @xmath126 ( see notations in sect .",
    "[ introduction ] , [ dw ] , [ line ] ) .",
    "the coercive field @xmath0 and the reversal field @xmath113 , measured in the same units , can be expressed in terms of one function of two dimensionless parameters : @xmath391 experimental observation of this type of scaling would be the best indirect evidence of the dw motion controlled hysteresis .",
    "the direct observation of the dw motion by smoke and stm methods in principle is possible @xcite and is much appreciate . at large fields",
    "@xmath392 the defects are inessential .",
    "therefore , the dependence on @xmath7 must vanish from scaling laws ( [ h - scale ] ) .",
    "it happens indeed , and both fields @xmath0 and @xmath113 are expressed in terms of one dimensionless parameter : @xmath393 where @xmath394 .",
    "note that in this limit the value @xmath7 vanishes from equations for the dynamic threshold fields as well : @xmath395 , @xmath396 .",
    "we presented also corresponding equations for the hla to which the most experimental efforts were concentrated .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that the hla is not the only measurable characteristics of the hl and even not the most informative its characteristics : the fields @xmath397 as well as the shape of the hysteresis curve are not less interesting . the functional dependence of the fields @xmath8 and @xmath105 on @xmath5 at @xmath5 not much overcoming the static threshold field @xmath7",
    "allows to restore the basic function @xmath398 of theory of the dw motion in a defect medium .    for sufficiently large @xmath5 the length @xmath234 in equations ( [ h - scale ] , [ scale - large ] ) and others is the size of the system .",
    "thus , the size effect is observable in the hl characteristics .",
    "however , at fields , larger than @xmath7 , but still smaller than the maximum defect strength , the moving dw produces bubbles playing the role of ready nuclei for magnetization reversal at the next half - cycle of the hysteresis loop .",
    "thus , the length @xmath234 in this case is the average distance between the bubbles .",
    "its strong dependence on the the field amplitude @xmath5 makes the scaling laws ( [ h - scale ] , [ scale - large ] ) less transparent , but they become size - independent .",
    "the scaling becomes simple again if the dominant defects are of topographic origin .",
    "the density of topographic defects is independent on the amplitude of magnetic field .",
    "then @xmath234 is the average distance between such defects .    in the case ,",
    "when the driven dw are almost free ( @xmath392 ) and the hl is narrow ( @xmath261 ) , the hla was found to be proportional to @xmath399 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by our numerical mc simulation .    in the nucleation controlled process almost rectangular hl shape",
    "is expected , unless the sample is divided into a multitude of magnetically disconnected grains .",
    "note that the shape of almost vertical parts of the hl in this case is determined by the dw motion and , therefore , is universal . in the case of nucleation",
    "controlled hysteresis the hla must grow logarithmically with the frequency and amplitude of magnetic field . however , the coefficient at the logarithm of frequency is smaller than that at the logarithm of the amplitude .",
    "slow nonlinear critical dynamics may produce the hl with various scaling limits as described in sect.[adiabatic ] .",
    "the comparison with the experiment is still rather poor since there is no systematic study of the hl characteristics as functions of dimensionless parameters .",
    "the experimental efforts were focused on the hla , but the precision of the measurements is not high enough for reliable determination of scaling .",
    "sue and erskine @xcite reported the observation of linear dependence of the hla on the logarithm of frequency @xcite with the coefficient proportional to temperature .",
    "both these facts agree with our theory .",
    "however , they also claimed the power dependence of the hla on the amplitude @xmath5 with the exponent about 1/4 .",
    "this dependence contradicts to our theory .",
    "the reason for discrepancy is not yet clear .",
    "the interval of variation of @xmath5 is not large enough to establish the exponential dependence reliably , but it definitely deviates from logarithm . on the other hand , our theory gives logarithmic dependence on @xmath5 only if @xmath261 .",
    "further studies both theoretical and experimental are necessary to clarify the situation .",
    "our numerical simulations show visibly the formation and propagation of domain walls as the dominant process at high temperature .",
    "the domain walls look rather rough .",
    "it can happen as a consequence of strong critical fluctuations which are not taken into account in our dw motion theory , or it may follow from the fact that the dimensionality 2 is the marginal for the development of roughness due to defects ( the roughness exponent @xmath49 equal to 1 for @xmath400 ) . nevertheless , the scaling low @xmath401 for @xmath43 is confirmed in numerical simulations at high temperatures . at lower temperature",
    "the nucleation becomes dominant .",
    "an interesting possibility to verify our predictions for the domain growth controlled hysteresis is a study of a hysteresis of adsorption isotherms in a close to equilibrium conditions . the process of close to equilibrium adsorption can be studied experimentally for noble gases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quasiequilibrium desorption of helium films has been studied in @xcite . in the case of equilibrium adsorption",
    "the chemical potential plays the role of magnetic field and the coverage - plays the role of magnetization . the domain wall width for adsorbed systems is only one lattice period wide .",
    "for this reason one can expect rather small nucleation barriers for equilibrium adsorption and more broad range of existence for domain growth controlled hysteresis than in magnetic films .",
    "more detailed analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "though the adsorption isotherms have been measured starting from langmuir , no hysteresis loop measurements has been performed until recently .",

    "<S> we consider three mechanisms of hysteresis phenomena in alternating magnetic field : the domain wall motion in a random medium , the nucleation and the retardation of magnetization due to slow ( critical ) fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we construct quantitative theory for all these processes . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis is characterized by two dynamic threshold fields , by coercive field and by the so - called reversal field . </S>",
    "<S> their ratios to the static threshold field is shown to be function of two dimensionless variables constituted from the frequency and amplitude of the ac field as well as from some characteristics of the magnet . </S>",
    "<S> the area and the shape of the hysteresis loop are found . </S>",
    "<S> we consider different limiting cases in which power dependencies are valid . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations show the domain wall formation and propagation and confirm the main theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> theory is compared with available experimental data .    2 </S>"
