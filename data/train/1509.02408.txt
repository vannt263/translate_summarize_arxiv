    "the existence of coherent superpositions is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics but , apparently , implies very counterintuitive consequences when extended to macroscopic systems .",
    "this problem , already pointed out since the beginning of quantum theory through the famous schrdinger cat paradox @xcite , has been the subject of a large scientific debate which is still open and very active .",
    "nowadays there is no doubt about the existence of quantum superpositions .",
    "indeed this effect has been demonstrated in a number of experiments involving microscopic systems ( photons @xcite , electrons @xcite , neutrons @xcite , atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "however , at least in principle , the standard theory of quantum mechanics is valid at any scale and does not put any limit on the size of the system : if you can delocalize a molecule then nothing should forbid you to delocalize a cat , apart from technical difficulties .",
    "such difficulties are usually associated with the impossibility of isolating the system from its environment , because it is well known that any weak interaction changing the state of the environment is sufficient to destroy the initial coherence of the system .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the ideal situation in which we have a macroscopic mass or a macroscopic charge perfectly isolated from the environment and prepared in a quantum superposition of two spatially separated states . without using any speculative theory of quantum gravity or sophisticated tools of quantum field theory , we propose a simple thought experiment based on particles interacting via semiclassical forces . surprisingly a simple consistency argument with relativistic causality is enough to obtain a fundamental result which , being related to gravitational and electric fields , indirectly tells us something about quantum gravity and quantum field theory .    the result is the following : assuming that a macroscopic mass @xmath0 is prepared in a superposition of two states separated by a distance @xmath1",
    ", then any experiment discriminating the coherent superposition from a classical incoherent mixture requires a minimum time @xmath2 , proportional to the mass and the separation distance .",
    "analogously for a quantum superposition of a macroscopic charge @xmath3 , such minimum time is proportional to the associated electric dipole @xmath4 . in a nutshell ,",
    "experiments testing macroscopic superpositions are possible in principle , but they need to be slow . for common experiments involving systems below the planck mass and the planck charge",
    "this limitation is irrelevant , however such time can become very important at macroscopic scales . as an extreme example , if the center of mass of the earth were in a quantum superposition with a separation distance of one micrometer , according to our result one would need a time equal to the age of the universe in order to distinguish this state from a classical statistical mixture .",
    "clearly this limitation suggests that at sufficiently macroscopic scales quantum mechanics can be safely replaced by classical statistical mechanics without noticing the difference .",
    "the fact that large gravitational or electromagnetic fields can be a limitation for the observation of quantum superpositions is not a new idea . in the past decades , several models of spontaneous localization @xcite",
    "have been proposed which , going beyond the standard theory of quantum mechanics , postulate the existence a gravity induced collapse at macroscopic scales .",
    "remaining within the domain of standard quantum mechanics , the loss of coherence in interference experiments due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation has been already studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "similarly , the interaction of a massive particle with gravitational waves @xcite and the dephasing effect of time dilation on internal degrees of freedom @xcite have been considered as possible origins of quantum decoherence .    for what concerns our thought experiment ,",
    "a similar setup can be found in the literature where the interference pattern of an electron passing through a double slit is destroyed by a distant measurement of its electric field .",
    "this thought experiment can be traced back to bohr as quoted in @xcite , was discussed by hardy interviewed in @xcite and appears as an exercise in the book by aharanov and rohrlich @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently different experiments involving interacting test particles have been proposed in order to discriminate the quantum nature of the gravitational field from a potentially classical description @xcite .",
    "the original contribution of our work is that , imposing the consistency with relativistic causality , our thought experiment allows the derivation of a fundamental minimum time which is valid for _ any _ possible experiment involving macroscopic superpositions . in this sense",
    "our bounds represent universal limitations having a role analogous to the heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics . for this reason , while our results could be observable in advanced and specific experimental setups @xcite , their main contribution is probably a better understanding of the theory of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales . for charged particles",
    "we propose two different measurements for testing the coherence .",
    "the first requires to accelerate the charge , and our bound on the discrimination time is due to the entanglement with the emitted photons . in the second ,",
    "the bound can be instead ascribed to the presence of the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . on the other hand",
    "we also find an equivalent bound associated to quantum superposition of large masses .",
    "what is the origin of this limitation ?",
    "the analogy suggests that the validity of our bound could be interpreted as an indirect evidence for the existence of quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field , and of quantum gravitational radiation .",
    "this work is structured in the following way : in section  [ experiment ] we propose our thought experiment which suggests a minimum discrimination time for any macroscopic quantum superposition . in section  [ time ] we derive a quantitative bound .",
    "finally in sections  [ ent ] and  [ qed ] we check the consistency of our results with an explicit analysis of a charged particle interacting with the electromagnetic field . here",
    "we propose two different measurements , and show that in both cases they are able to check the coherence only if their duration satisfies our fundamental limit .",
    "consider the thought experiment represented in fig .  [ gedanken ] , and described by the following protocol .",
    "the protocol can be equivalently applied to quantum superpositions of large masses or large charges .",
    "* protocol of the thought experiment *    1 .",
    "alice has at disposal , in her laboratory , a massive / charged particle in a macroscopic superposition of a `` left '' and a `` right '' state : @xmath5 the wave functions of the two states are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the relative separation of the superposition .",
    "bob is in a laboratory at a distance @xmath9 from alice and containing a charged / massive test particle prepared in the ground state of a very narrow harmonic trap .",
    "bob freely chooses between two options : doing nothing ( detector = _ off _ ) , or removing the trap ( detector = _ on _ ) . in the first case",
    "the state of test particle remains unchanged while , in the second case , the dynamics is sensitive to the local newton / coulomb field generated by alice s particle and the global state will eventually become entangled .",
    "if the detector is _ off _ , the initial quantum superposition is preserved , while if the detector is _ on _ the generation of entanglement eventually destroys the coherence of the reduced state of alice .",
    "3 .   alice performs an arbitrary measurement in her laboratory with the task of discriminating the coherent superposition from a statistical incoherent mixture of the two states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "for example she could make an interference experiment , a measurement of the velocity , a projection on the symmetric / antisymmetric basis @xmath12 , _ etc._. the specific details of the experiment are irrelevant . depending on the result of the measurement",
    ", alice deduces the choice of bob ( _ i.e. _ if the detector was _ on _ or _ off _ ) .",
    "clearly , the previous thought experiment constitutes a communication protocol in which bob can send one bit of information to alice .",
    "moreover , for a large enough mass @xmath0 or for a large enough charge @xmath3 , the test particle of bob can become entangled with alice s particle in an arbitrarily short time .",
    "but then , apparently , bob can send a message to alice faster than light violating the fundamental principle of relativistic causality .",
    "how can we solve this paradox ?",
    "let us make a list of possible solutions :    1 .",
    "it is impossible to prepare a macroscopic superposition state or to preserve its coherence because of some unknown intrinsic effect lying outside the theory of quantum mechanics .",
    "once the superposition is created the particle is entangled with the gravitational / electromagnetic field and the reduced state of the particle is mixed . independently on the measurement of bob , alice always finds the state of the particle incoherent unless the entanglement process can be in some way reversed .",
    "3 .   independently on the presence or absence of entanglement , alice can not locally discriminate instantaneously whether the superposition is coherent or not .",
    "more quantitatively we have that , if bob is able to generate entanglement in a time @xmath13 and if @xmath14 is the time necessary to alice for performing her discrimination measurement , then relativistic causality requires @xmath15 therefore , whenever entanglement can be generated in a time @xmath16 , we get a non - trivial lower bound on @xmath14 .",
    "anomalous decoherence effects @xcite ( as _ e.g. _  the penrose spontaneous localization model ) are important open problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics and can not be excluded a priori . up to now",
    "however their existence was never experimentally demonstrated and therefore , instead of closing our discussion by directly invoking point a ) , we try to remain within the framework of quantum mechanics and check if points b ) or c ) are plausible solutions .",
    "the reader who is familiar with the field of open quantum systems may find the option b ) very natural . in standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the formation of entanglement between a system and its environment",
    "is widely accepted as the origin of any observed form of decoherence .",
    "indeed this approach has also been used to explain the decoherence of moving charged particles , mainly focusing to the double - slit interference experiment  @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized by previous works that in a double - slit experiment there is a limit to the charge of the particle above which photons are emitted due to the acceleration associated to the interference paths  @xcite . for large charges then , the particle entangles with the emitted photons and this effect can destroy the interference pattern .",
    "the reader can then notice that also in our case the particle needs to be accelerated when it is put in the superposition  , and if it is charged it will radiate and can become entangled with the emitted photons .",
    "similarly , an accelerated mass generates gravitational radiation and can become entangled with the emitted gravitons .",
    "however , in appendix  [ rad ] we prove that , if the accelerations are slow enough , the resulting quantum state of the electromagnetic field has almost overlap one with the vacuum , and therefore the particle does not get entangled with the emitted photons because no photons at all are emitted . the same argument",
    "can be repeated for the gravitational radiation in the linear approximation .",
    "the reader may now think that the particle in the superposition   is entangled at least with its static coulomb electric field .",
    "however , as we show in details in appendix  [ dof ] , the static coulomb electric field is not a propagating degree of freedom since it vanishes in absence of electric charges .",
    "thus , the hilbert space associated to the coulomb field is the same hilbert space of the particle , whose reduced state remains pure .    what is then the solution of the paradox ?",
    "a reasonable answer appears to be the final option c ) .",
    "basically , even if the state of the particle is pure and coherent , alice can not instantaneously test this fact with a local experiment in her laboratory .",
    "notice that the hypothesis c ) is weaker than the others and can logically coexist with a ) and b ) . clearly in every case in which a ) or b ) are valid alice can not make any useful experiment because decoherence has already happened .",
    "therefore we conclude that the weaker and most general solution to the paradox is the fundamental limitation exposed in point c ) . in sections  [ ent ] and  [ qed ] ,",
    "we propose two different measurements and show that they are both consistent with this limitation .",
    "in the previous section we argued that relativistic causality requires a fundamental limitation : alice s discrimination experiment must be slow . but",
    "how slow it has to be ? by construction any thought experiment of the class described before gives a lower bound on the discrimination time @xmath14 whenever @xmath16 . in what follows we are going to optimize over this class of experiments .",
    "we anticipate that this approach leads to the following two bounds which constitute the main results of this work .    * ( i ) minimum discrimination time for quantum superpositions of large masses * + given a particle of mass @xmath0 prepared in a macroscopic quantum superposition of two states separated by a distance @xmath1 , it is impossible to locally discriminate the coherent superposition from an incoherent mixture in a time ( up to a multiplicative numerical constant ) less than @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the planck mass @xmath19    * ( ii ) minimum discrimination time for quantum superpositions of large charges * + given a particle of charge @xmath3 prepared in a macroscopic quantum superposition of two states separated by a distance @xmath1 , it is impossible to locally discriminate the coherent superposition from an incoherent mixture in a time ( up to a multiplicative numerical constant ) less than @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the planck charge @xmath22    before giving a derivation of the previous results , we stress that both the bounds and are relevant only for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "indeed for systems below the planck mass / charge , even if the bounds are formally correct , their meaning is trivial since any measurement of the state must at least interact with both parts of the superposition and this process requires at least a time @xmath25 .",
    "let us first focus on the superpositions of massive particles and give a proof of the bound ( the proof of is analogous and will be given later ) .",
    "it is easy to check that , for a sufficiently narrow trap ( detector = _ off _ ) the test mass of bob is insensitive to the gravitational force of alice s particle and remains stable in its ground state ( see appendix  [ strength ] for details ) . on the contrary ,",
    "if the trap is removed , the test mass will experience a different force depending on the position of alice s particle .",
    "the two corresponding hamiltonians are : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of bob s particle , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the different gravitational forces associated to the  left \" and  right \" positions of alice s particle .",
    "their difference @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of alice s particle , determines the dipole force sensitivity that bob should be able to detect in order to induce the decoherence of the reduced state possessed by alice .    given the initial state of the test mass @xmath32 , it is easy to check that entanglement can be generated in a time @xmath33 whenever the different time evolutions associated to @xmath34 and @xmath35 drive the test mass into almost orthogonal states , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath36 such time depends on the initial state @xmath37 and on the loschmidt echo operator @xmath38 which after two iterations of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula can be written as @xmath39\\;.\\ ] ] neglecting the complex phase factor @xmath40 , @xmath41 is essentially a phase  space displacement operator of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the shifts in position and momentum , respectively .",
    "since the initial state @xmath44 of the test mass is the ground state of a very narrow harmonic trap , it will correspond to a localized gaussian wave packet which is very noisy in momentum and therefore we may focus only on the position shift and compare it with the position uncertainty @xmath45 of the initial state ( see appendix  [ strength ] for a detailed proof ) .",
    "we can argue that entanglement is generated only after a time @xmath46 such that @xmath47    apparently bob can generate entanglement arbitrarily quickly by reducing the position uncertainty @xmath45 .",
    "however there is a fundamental limit to the localization precision which is set by the planck length .",
    "it is widely accepted that no reasonable experiment can overcome this limit  @xcite : @xmath48 from eq .  ,",
    "substituting eq . and using the minimum @xmath45 allowed by the constraint , we get @xmath49 as we have explained in the previous section , relativistic causality implies the inequality involving alice s measurement time @xmath14 and the entanglement time @xmath13 .",
    "such inequality provides a lower bound on @xmath14 only if @xmath50 while it gives no relevant information for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we parametrize @xmath9 in terms of @xmath13 and a dimensionless parameter @xmath52 : @xmath53 using this parametrization , from eq .  , we get    @xmath54    from the causality inequality we have @xmath55 optimizing over @xmath52 we get    @xmath56    this is , up to a multiplicative numerical constant , the bound given in eq . .",
    "the calculation in the case in which we have a test charge instead of a test mass is almost identical .",
    "the only difference is that eq .",
    "is replaced by the coulomb counterpart @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the charges of alice s and bob s particles , respectively , while the localization limit is replaced by bob s particle charge radius  @xcite @xmath60 more details on the minimum localization of a macroscopic charge are given in appendix  [ loc ] . from eq.s and , repeating exactly the previous argument one finds @xmath61 which is , up to a multiplicative numerical constant , the bound given in eq . .",
    "in section  [ time ] we have proved that relativistic causality requires that any measurement alice can perform to test the coherence of her superposition must require a minimum time , depending on the mass or charge of her particle . here",
    "we focus on the electromagnetic case , and propose two different measurements to check the coherence of the superposition .",
    "the first is a simplified version of the experiment proposed in ref .",
    "let alice s particle have spin @xmath62 , and suppose that her superposition is entangled with the spin , i.e.   is replaced by @xmath63 let now alice apply a spin - dependent force , that vanishes if the spin is up , while brings the particle from @xmath64 to @xmath65 if the spin is down .",
    "if bob does not perform the measurement , the final state of alice s particle is @xmath66 where @xmath67 on the contrary ,",
    "if bob induces a collapse of the wave - function , the final state is @xmath68 and alice can test the coherence with a measurement on the spin .",
    "however , this protocol requires the particle to be accelerated if it has spin down and needs to be moved from @xmath64 to @xmath65",
    ". then it will radiate , and it can entangle with the emitted photons . a semiclassical computation of the emitted radiation can be found in appendix  [ rad ] .",
    ".   shows that such radiation is indistinguishable from the vacuum state of the field iff the motion lasts for at least the time required by our previous bound  .",
    "in section  [ ent ] we have provided an example of experiment able to test the coherence .",
    "the protocol requires to accelerate the charge , and if its duration is too short , the charge radiates and entangles with the emitted photons . the reader could now think that the bound on the time could be beaten with an experiment that does not involve accelerations .",
    "an example of such experiment could seem to be a measurement of the canonical momentum of alice s particle . in this section ,",
    "we first show that this measurement is indeed able to test the coherence of the superposition and then we estimate the minimum time necessary to perform it .",
    "the canonical momentum of a charged particle coupled to the electromagnetic field is not gauge invariant , and therefore can not be directly measured .",
    "alice can instead measure directly the velocity of her particle , that is gauge invariant .",
    "however , its relation with the canonical momentum now contains the vector potential .",
    "even if there is no external electromagnetic field , the latter is a quantum - mechanical entity , and is subject to quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "then , the fluctuations of the vector potential enter in the relation between velocity and momentum .",
    "if alice is not able to measure the field outside her laboratory , she can measure only the velocity of her particle ( see appendix  [ dof ] for a detailed discussion ) , and can reconstruct its canonical momentum only if the fluctuations are small .",
    "we show that in an instantaneous measurement these fluctuations are actually infinite .",
    "however , if alice measures the average of the velocity over a time @xmath69 , they decrease as @xmath70 , and can be neglected if @xmath69 is large enough . this minimum time",
    "is found consistent with the bound derived in section  [ time ] .    in order to simplify our formulas , in this section and in the related appendices we put as in  @xcite @xmath71 these constant",
    "will be put back into the final result .",
    "let us first show that alice can test the coherence with a measurement of the canonical momentum of her particle .",
    "let the particle be in the coherent superposition   of two identical wave - packets centered in different points , with wave - function @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "the probability distribution of the canonical momentum @xmath74 is the modulus square of the fourier transform of the wave - function : @xmath75 and she can test the coherence of the superposition from the interference pattern in momentum space generated by the cosine . indeed , an incoherent statistical mixture would be associated to the probability distribution @xmath76 where the cosine squared is replaced by @xmath77 , its average over the phase @xmath73 .",
    "notice from   that , in order to be actually able to test the coherence , alice must measure the canonical momentum with a precision of at least @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this precision increases with the separation of the wave - packets , e.g. for @xmath80 , it is @xmath81 .",
    "let now alice s particle carry an electric charge @xmath3 .",
    "we want to take into account the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , so quantum electrodynamics is required .",
    "the global hilbert space is then the tensor product of the hilbert space of the particle @xmath82 with the hilbert space of the field @xmath83 .",
    "the reader can find in appendix  [ emf ] the details of the quantization .",
    "the position and canonical momentum operators of alice s particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 still act in the usual way on the particle hilbert space alone , so that the argument of subsection  [ momentum ] remains unchanged .",
    "the full interacting hamiltonian of the particle and the electromagnetic field is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vector - potential operator @xmath88 of   with the coordinate @xmath89 replaced with the position operator @xmath84 , and @xmath90 is the free hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field defined in  .    due to the minimal - coupling substitution",
    ", the operator associated to the velocity of the particle is @xmath91=\\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}-q\\;\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\right)\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] that contains the operator vector - potential , and acts also on the hilbert space of the field .",
    "the canonical momentum can be reconstructed from the velocity with @xmath92 if the second term in the rhs can be neglected . with the help of the commutation relations  , a direct computation of the variance of @xmath93 on the vacuum state of the field",
    "gives @xmath94 that has a quadratic divergence for @xmath95 due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this divergence can be cured averaging the vector potential over time with a smooth function @xmath96 .",
    "we must then move to the heisenberg picture , where operators explicitly depend on time , and we define it to coincide with the schrdinger picture at @xmath97 , the time at which alice measures the velocity . since the divergence in   does not depend neither on the mass nor on the charge of alice s particle and is proportional to the identity operator on the particle hilbert space @xmath98 , it has nothing to do with the interaction of the particle with the field . then the leading contribution to the result",
    "can be computed evolving the field with the free hamiltonian @xmath90 only , i.e. with @xmath99 defining the time - averaged vector potential as @xmath100 its variance over the vacuum state of the field is now @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the fourier transform of @xmath96 .",
    "taking as @xmath96 a normalized gaussian function of width @xmath69 centered at @xmath97 : @xmath103 we get as promised a finite result proportional to @xmath70 : @xmath104 then , if alice estimates one component of the canonical momentum ( say the one along the @xmath105 axis ) with the time average of the velocity taken with the function @xmath96 , she commits an error of the order @xmath106 comparing   with the required precision to test the coherence  , the minimum time required is @xmath107 in agreement with the bound   imposed by relativistic causality alone .",
    "in this work we have studied the limitations that the gravitational and electric fields produced by a macroscopic particle impose on quantum superposition experiments .",
    "we found that , in order to avoid a contradiction between quantum mechanics and relativistic causality , a minimum time is necessary in order to discriminate a coherent superposition from an incoherent statistical mixture .",
    "this discrimination time is proportional to the separation distance of the superposition and to the mass ( or charge ) of the particle .    in the same way",
    "as the heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired the development of a complete theory of quantum mechanics , our fundamental and quantitative bounds on the discrimination time can be useful for the development of current and future theories of quantum gravity .",
    "moreover , despite an experimental observation of our results clashes with the difficulty of preparing superpositions of masses above the planck scale , the current technological progress on highly massive quantum optomechanical and electromechanical systems provides a promising context @xcite for testing our predictions .",

    "in this appendix we show that for bob a measurement of the position is always better than a measurement of the momentum , i.e. it permits to distinguish the force difference @xmath108 in a shorter time .",

    "suppose then that , after switching on the detector , bob tries to distinguish the two states of alice by a measurement of @xmath113 : accordingly the momentum spread @xmath114 of his initial state must be lower than the displacement in momentum @xmath115 given by  .",
    "recalling that heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xmath116 is saturated by a gaussian pure state , the minimum time after which bob can distinguish is @xmath117 on the other hand , from   the minimum discrimination time with a measurement of @xmath105 is @xmath118 the reader can check that   implies @xmath119 , i.e. if the trap is strong enough to be insensible to the force difference , for bob it is always better to measure the position of his particle rather than its momentum .",
    "in this appendix we prove that the minimum width over which a charge @xmath3 greater than the planck charge @xmath120 can be localized is its charge radius  .",
    "let us suppose to use a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath109 to localize the charge .",
    "one could think that in principle , with a strong enough trap , the charge can be arbitrarily localized .",
    "however , from the larmor formula  @xcite we know that a classical particle with charge @xmath3 following a harmonic motion of frequency @xmath109 and width @xmath45 loses into electromagnetic radiation a power @xmath121 in the quantum case , the charge radiates until it gets to the ground state of the trap , where it can not radiate anymore since there are no other states with a lower energy to go .",
    "however , if the trap is very strong , its ground state is very localized , and therefore has a great uncertainty in velocity .",
    "since any moving charge generates a magnetic field , this velocity uncertainty generates a large uncertainty in the magnetic field , resulting in a large entanglement between the state of the particle and the state of the field .",
    "qualitatively , this happens when the energy classically radiated in a period becomes greater than @xmath122 , the energy of the first excited state . combining   with",

    "in this appendix we consider a classical charged particle following an accelerated trajectory and coupled to the quantum electromagnetic field .",

    "its overlap with the vacuum can be computed with  : @xmath161    we now consider a point particle carrying charge @xmath3 that starts in @xmath162 at @xmath97 , and in a time @xmath163 is brought to the position @xmath164 with a trajectory described by @xmath165 .",
    "the current density is then @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the particle velocity . for wavelengths large with respect to the extension of the motion ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath168 we want to look at the state of the field after the particle has reached the new position @xmath164 , i.e. for @xmath169 .",
    "since the velocity @xmath170 vanishes for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the displacement of   becomes @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the fourier transform of the velocity .",
    "putting   into  , the overlap becomes @xmath175 for simplicity we consider a one - dimensional motion , and we put the @xmath105 axis in the direction of @xmath176 . as an example , we take @xmath177 satisfying the conditions @xmath178 the fourier transform of the velocity is @xmath179 and the overlap @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the sine integral function @xmath182 looking at  , the dominant contribution to the integral in   comes from the region @xmath183 .",
    "the approximation in   is then valid iff @xmath184 , i.e. if the motion is not relativistic .",
    "the final result   tells us that for a fixed distance @xmath1 , no photons are radiated if the motion lasts for at least @xmath185 then , alice can always create the coherent superposition   without entangling her particle with the emitted photons provided she has enough time to do it .",
    "besides , if alice wants to perform the measurement of section  [ ent ] , she needs at least a time   to bring the state @xmath64 back to @xmath65 if she does not want to entangle with the emitted photons .",
    "in this appendix we explain in detail why when alice s charged particle is in the superposition  , despite it generates a static electric field that depends on its position , it is still not entangled with the field , and the global state is a product with the field part in the vacuum .",
    "the first maxwell s equation reads @xmath186 and completely determines the electric potential operator @xmath187 in terms of the charge density operator @xmath188 : @xmath189 putting together   and  , the electric field is given by @xmath190 then , the longitudinal ( i.e. proportional to @xmath136 ) component of the electric field operator is determined by the charge - density operator , and acts on the hilbert space of the particle alone .",
    "therefore , even if the field is in its vacuum state  , the expectation value of the electric field is the static coulomb electric field generated by the expectation value of the charge density , and hence depends on the particle wave - function .",
    "this means that the state of the field alone does not contain all the information on the electric field , since its longitudinal component is encoded into the state of the particle .    seen from a different perspective , the longitudinal component of the electric field is not a dynamical propagating degree of freedom , since it vanishes in absence of external charges and is completely determined by them , so there is no hilbert space associated to it .",
    "the hilbert space of the field contains only the degrees of freedom associated to the electromagnetic radiation , i.e. the magnetic field and the transverse ( orthogonal to @xmath136 ) component of the electric field .",
    "then in a product state with the field part in the vacuum only these components are in the vacuum mode , while there can be a static electric field depending on the state of the particle .",
    "in this appendix we explain in detail why alice can measure only the velocity of her particle , and not its canonical momentum , if she is constrained to remain in her laboratory , which has the size of the support of the wave - function of the particle .",
    "the wave - function @xmath191 of a particle carrying electric charge @xmath3 coupled to an electromagnetic field is invariant under the joint gauge transformation  @xcite @xmath192 the canonical momentum @xmath193 is not gauge invariant , but transforms in the heisenberg picture as @xmath194 and therefore alice can not measure it directly . the reader can easily check using   and   that the velocity given by   is gauge invariant , as it has to be .",
    "alice can then measure directly the velocity , and reconstruct from it the canonical momentum .",
    "however , the relation between them ( eq .  ) contains the vector potential , that from   is not gauge invariant , and can not be directly measured . in the coulomb gauge , it is possible to invert   and express the vector potential in terms of the magnetic field , that is gauge invariant and can be actually measured by alice : @xmath195 putting together   and  , we get @xmath196 however , reconstructing the canonical momentum from the velocity with   requires alice to measure the magnetic field in the whole space .",
    "even if she can allow for some error in the reconstruction , the region in which she has to measure the field increases with the charge @xmath3 , and can extend well outside the support of the wave - function ."
