    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are believed to be old neutron stars spun - up by accreting matter from a companion star , and thus are the end products of the accretion process observed in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are unique laboratories of high  energy plasma physics and magnetic reconnection . only in msps do the emission regions of @xmath0rays probe the magnetic fields close to the neutron star .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has revolutionized the study of msps , leading to the discovery of 43 new msps , and strikingly , 40% of the newly identified _",
    "msps with measured orbital parameters turned out to be `` black widows '' ( bws ; companion mass @xmath1 ) or `` redbacks '' ( rbs ; @xmath2 ) , in which the pulsar radio emission is eclipsed by a wind from the companion @xcite .",
    "psr j1544 + 4937 is a _ fermi _",
    "lat @xmath0ray source , identified as a radio millisecond pulsar ( msp ) with a 2.16-ms spin period by the giant metrewave radio telescope @xcite .",
    "the radio timing observations give an orbital period of 2.9 hrs with an eclipse duration of 22 min ( 13% of its orbit ) , and a minimum companion mass of 0.017 @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , making it a bw pulsar .",
    "no optical counterpart was detected in the archival sdss images to limiting magnitudes of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained deep optical images to identify the optical counterpart of psr j1544 + 4937 , and to constrain the properties of the system .",
    "a highly variable source is revealed in our optical images at the radio pulsar position .",
    "we describe the optical observations and photometry in  2 .",
    "we discuss the distance to the source and present the light curve modeling in  3 , and the mass - radius relation of the companion in  4 .",
    "a final discussion of the results is in  5 .",
    "we observed psr j1544 + 4937 using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ? * ) on the keck i 10m telescope on 4 nights in 2013 : may 9 , aug 4 , sep 4 , and sep 9 .",
    "we used the _",
    "b _ , _ g _ , _ r _ , and _",
    "i _ filters , with exposure times ranging from 190s to 300s .",
    "all the _ i _ band images were taken simultaneously with _",
    "g _ band images , while all the _ r _ band images were taken simultaneously with _",
    "b _ band images , and therefore the measured @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors are not affected by variability . the _ g _ band images taken on may 9 were not accompanied by _",
    "i _ band images due to filter wheel problems that night .",
    "we also took 30s exposures of the same fields in order to get a large sample of unsaturated stars for zero - point calibration .",
    "the images were taken at airmass@xmath11 with seeings of 0.6@xmath120.8@xmath12 .",
    "the data were reduced via standard techniques using lpip .",
    "photometry was performed first on the 30s exposure images in idl using a 1  radius aperture relative to unsaturated sdss stars in the field of view , with _",
    "gri _ transformed to _",
    "bri _ using the lupton transformation equations , and then performed on the 190s to 300s exposure images relative to unsaturated stars in the 30s exposure images .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , a highly variable source is detected within 0.1  of the radio position of the pulsar ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in all four bands , consistent with our typical astrometric uncertainty .",
    "the counterpart profiles are consistent with a point source , with no detectable position drift within 0.1 . in figure 2 , we show the lris optical light curves , folded using the radio timing ephemeris @xcite and shifted by 0.25 so that phase @xmath15 corresponds to the pulsar superior conjunction ( radio eclipse of the pulsar by the companion ) .",
    "as shown in the middle and bottom panels of figure 2 , the light curves are achromatic within photometric uncertainties over the orbital period , with @xmath16mag and @xmath17mag , where the quoted errors are the standard deviations of the mean . to test the reliability of our photometry , especially at the faint end",
    ", we performed the same photometric procedures on several neighbor stars with comparable magnitudes of the targeted source , and all of them are indeed constant within photometric errors .",
    "we also obtained one @xmath18-band image with an 860s exposure using the megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ; * ? ? ? * ) on 2013 feb 11 .",
    "a point source is detected at the nominal radio position with @xmath19 mag , which corresponds to @xmath20mag using the lupton transformation equations .",
    "the converted r band magnitude from cfht is shown as a red square in figure 2 .",
    "psr j1544 + 4937 is located at galactic coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with an observed dispersion measure ( dm ) of psr j1544 + 4937 is 23.23 @xmath23 pc @xcite . the thicker layer of free electrons in the milky way , the so - called warm ionized medium , has a scale - height of about 1.8 kpc @xcite . at vertical distances out of the galactic plane",
    "larger than 12 kpc , the dm vs distance curve flattens @xcite , making dm an insensitive indicator of distance .",
    "psr j1544 + 4937 unfortunately falls into this insensitive region .",
    "the ne2001 model by @xcite gives a distance estimate of @xmath24 pc , while @xcite suggests that the distance is 25 kpc ( see figure 1 in their paper for dm@xmath25 @xmath23 pc at @xmath26 ) .",
    "for comparison , b1508 + 55 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , the pulsar with a reliable parallax nearest to psr j1544 + 4937 ( @xmath29 away ) , has a dm@xmath3019.61 @xmath23 pc , and a parallax distance of @xmath31 kpc @xcite .",
    "this suggests that j1544 + 4937 , which has a higher dm than b1508 + 55 , is likely to have a distance larger than 2 kpc .",
    "therefore , we adopt a distance of 25kpc for psr j1544 + 493 .",
    "psr j1544 + 4937 is located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath22 ) , and the extinction correction in this direction is negligible with @xmath32mag @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors imply a nearly constant effective temperature of @xmath33k over different orbital phases .",
    "if the temperature is dominated by isotropic pulsar heating , given the radio timing results from @xcite , the inferred heating efficiency is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the orbital separation , @xmath36 is the irradiation temperature ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the spin down luminosity . such an efficiency is comparable to the values estimated in other bw systems @xcite .",
    "we first tried to fit these light curves using icarus , a newly developed binary light curve synthesis code @xcite .",
    "only keck lris data were used in the modeling .",
    "pulsar heating is taken into account with a heating efficiency @xmath39 and a @xmath40 factor to account for the projected illuminated area , where @xmath41 is the angle between the surface normal and the direction to the pulsar .",
    "btsettl atmosphere models are used @xcite .",
    "heat redistribution is not included .",
    "there are seven free parameters in the model : the mass ratio @xmath42 , the orbital inclination @xmath43 , the distance @xmath44 , the companion s filling factor @xmath45 relative to its roche lobe radius @xmath46 , its dayside and nightside temperatures @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the reddening in j band @xmath49 to the system assuming @xmath50 .",
    "given the high galactic latitude and low extinction ( @xmath32mag ) in this direction , we restrict @xmath51 . given the eclipses observed in radio , the binary can not be face - on , and thus we assume @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we also assume that the companion is tidally locked .",
    "there is no set of parameters in icarus with @xmath53 that fits the light curve well , and even the best fits have @xmath54 ( dof@xmath55 ) . due to the assumed temperature distribution ,",
    "all icarus models predict larger amplitude in bluer bands .",
    "fit example by icarus is shown in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "the resulting one- and two - dimensional marginalized confidence contours of the parameters are shown in figure 3 .",
    "given the dayside temperature distribution assumed , the irradiation temperature @xmath36 is mostly affected by the observed color and therefore is relatively well constrained .",
    "there is no constraint on the inclination , distance ( which is degenerate with the filling factor ) , and neutron star mass ( which is degenerate with the companion mass ) .    if we remove the constraints on inclination angles in icarus , we could get a group of relatively better fits to the light curves ( @xmath56 ) with cool dayside ( @xmath57k ) and low inclination angles ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "such a set of parameters leads to negligible flux from the night side , therefore relatively more achromatic light curves .",
    "however , given the observed eclipses in radio @xcite , this is unlikely to be true .",
    "alternatively , the achromatic light curves can be explained in models with hot patches at @xmath59k on the surface of the companion , and negligible radiation from other regions . in such scenarios ,",
    "the optical variability only depends on the projected area of the hot patches along line of sight .",
    "we can then derive the projected solid angle ( effective area over distance square , @xmath60 ) of these hot patches as a function of orbital phase from the optical light curves .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure 2 , we show the resulted ratio of the square root of the projected area over distance ( @xmath61 ) in units of @xmath62/kpc . we assumed @xmath63k and the btsettl atmosphere model @xcite .",
    "we tried two toy models of hot patches to fit the @xmath61 curve .",
    "first , we tried a hot dayside model with an isothermal temperature profile at @xmath64k and negligible emission from the night side .",
    "such a hot dayside could be caused by effective heat transportation / redistribution on the dayside .",
    "a spherical star was used .",
    "we obtained the best - fit at inclination angle @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , as shown in the solid line in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "we noticed that the optical light curves might be slightly asymmetric , with an optical minimum earlier than the radio eclipse .",
    "future deep imaging observations near the minimum will allow one to investigate the possible asymmetry .",
    "second , we tried a hot spot model with an isothermal profile at @xmath64k facing the neutron star , and negligible emission from other regions .",
    "such a hot spot could be caused by the magnetic field of a companion , where the magnetic pole(s ) are potentially heated by the magnetically confined pulsar wind .",
    "we treated the hot spot radius ( @xmath68 ) , central latitude ( @xmath69 ) , and inclination angle @xmath43 as free parameters .",
    "we obtained the best - fit at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , as shown in the dashed line in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "a third option for the hot patch is a stripe irradiated by the energetic , narrow pulsar beam rather than the hypothetically more uniform pulsar wind .",
    "such a scenario has been demonstrated in the case of the redback psr  j1740@xmath755340 , where the authors conclude that there is a very narrow , but longitudinally extended stripe covering @xmath76 of the companion surface @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon could be acting in psr  j1544@xmath774937 . due to relatively large scattering in the data ( as shown in the bottom panel in figure 2 ) , it is difficult to distinguish different models , and therefore we did not attempt to model the stripe .",
    "the lowest possible mean density of the companion is reached when the companion fills its roche lobe .",
    "this minimum mean density can be approximately set by the orbital period @xcite : @xmath78 g @xmath23 , as shown in the black solid line in figure 4 , which puts an upper limit for possible companion radius at a given companion mass .",
    "given the radio timing constraints , the mass of the companion depends on the neutron star mass and binary orbital inclination .",
    "the radius of the companion can be estimated from optical light curves , and are most sensitive to the distance , inclination and the assumed optical emitting model .",
    "to simplify the case , we assumed a neutron star mass of @xmath79 , and two possible distances of @xmath80 kpc and 5 kpc .",
    "we adopted the best - fit hot spot and hot dayside models discussed in  3.4 , and an fixed inclination angle of @xmath81 for icarus .",
    "the resulted companion masses and radii are shown in figure 4 , with green circles , blue squares , and red stars for hot spot , hot dayside , and icarus models , respectively .",
    "open symbols are for @xmath82 kpc , and solid symbols are for @xmath80 kpc .    for comparison",
    ", we also plotted the theoretical mass - radius relations for hydrogen brown dwarfs from the modules for experiments in astrophysics ( mesa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and helium and carbon objects from @xcite .",
    "note that these theoretical curves were derived for isolated objects , and pulsar heating could inflate the companion . as shown in figure 4 ,",
    "if the optical emission is from a heated dayside ( hot dayside or icarus models ) , the companion is likely a hydrogen brown dwarf if @xmath83 kpc , or a helium or carbon object if @xmath84 kpc .",
    "if the optical emission is dominately from a small hot spot , at a given distance , the inferred radii are much larger than the radii given by the hot dayside or icarus models , and could be a hydrogen brown dwarf at @xmath852.4kpc",
    ". a hydrogen companion could be the descendent of an accreting msp lmxb such as sax j1808.43658 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a helium or carbon companion could be the descendent of an ultra compact x - ray binary ( @xmath86 days ) , where the donor had substantial mass loss via roche lobe overflow and pulsar wind evaporating as it evolved @xcite .",
    "we identified the optical counterpart of psr j1544 + 4937 and obtained multi - band optical light curves , which show 2mag modulations in the b , g , r and i bands at the 2.9 hr orbital period given by the radio timing ephemeris ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the optical maximum occurs around the inferior conjunction , where the pulsar is located between the companion and the earth , suggesting that the optical variation is due to pulsar heating on the dayside of the companion facing the pulsar .",
    "an intriguing feature of this system revealed by optical photometry is that there is no significant color variation over the orbital period .",
    "the observed color is consistent with an effective temperature of @xmath874300k .",
    "the standard pulsar heating models with @xmath88 on the dayside do not work well for the observed light curves .",
    "a possible model is that the optical radiation is dominated by a heated magnetic pole of the companion ( dashed line in the bottom panel of figure 2 ) . assuming the radio eclipses are caused by cyclotron / synchrotron absorption , @xcite estimate a required magnetic field of @xmath89 g in the vicinity of the companion at a scale of 0.5 @xmath62 .",
    "if the required magnetic field is provided by the magnetosphere of the companion @xcite , the magnetic field near the surface of the companion ( @xmath90 ; see  4 ) is therefore 25100 times higher , i.e. @xmath910.31.1 kg .",
    "this is comparable to magnetic fields in brown dwarfs @xcite .    besides , it appears the companion is unlikely to be roche - lobe filling ,",
    "unless the distance is larger than 5 kpc or its optical radiation is dominantly from a small region on the surface of the companion , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "previous study has found that not all bws and rbs fill their roche lobes @xcite . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this has direct implications for the radio eclipses , as the ionized gas cloud floating around can not originate from loosely bound matter at the surface of a roche - lobe filling star , and has to have been pulled off the surface or been generated by a wind from the companion .",
    "only a few bws have optical light curves with good color coverage , with the best one being psr j13113430 .",
    "interestingly , the standard pulsar - heating model can not fit the optical light curves of psr j13113430 either @xcite .",
    "one model the authors adopted is to add a cold spot near l1 .",
    "this led to reduced temperature differences on the dayside , which is similar to our toy models of isothermal hot dayside or spot models .",
    "optical imaging of bws in the future with better color coverage can enable more detailed study of the temperature distribution of the companion , which will help understand the pulsar heating process , and heat reprocessing / transportation on the companion .",
