    "study of the parity non - conservation ( pnc ) in atoms have reached the accuracy where small corrections like breit interaction and radiative corrections play significant role ( see , e.q .",
    "review @xcite ) .",
    "for example , experimental accuracy for the pnc in cesium is 0.35% @xcite .",
    "interpretation of this result using earlier atomic calculations @xcite lead to apparent disagreement with the standard model  @xcite .",
    "this disagreement had been resolved when breit  @xcite and radiative  @xcite corrections were included into analysis .",
    "in present paper we revisit breit corrections to the pnc amplitudes in many - electron atoms .",
    "previous calculations were focused on the @xmath0 pnc amplitude in cs  @xcite , while some also considered very similar ( in terms of electron structure ) @xmath2 pnc amplitude in fr  @xcite .",
    "the results are considered to be in reasonable agreement with each other in spite of some difference in the final values given by different calculations ( up to @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is because breit correction to the pnc amplitude in cesium was small ( @xmath8 ) and relatively rough estimations were sufficient for the sake of the interpretation of the experimental measurements .",
    "however , if we need to calculate breit corrections to pnc in atoms heavier than cesium or , in general , if we want to have a reliable method to study the effect of breit interaction in heavy many - electron atoms the important question to ask is what kind of approach should be used to do this ?",
    "the answer is evident from the analysis of the details of the calculations of breit contributions by means of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "the analysis reveals very poor convergence of the mbpt with respect to the number of residual coulomb interactions included into the higher - order terms .",
    "this means that some all - order technique is needed to sum up important chains of higher - order terms to all orders .",
    "the natural choice is to present inter - electron interaction as a sum of coulomb and breit terms and to treat both terms the same way .",
    "we have developed such approach in our previous work  @xcite and applied it to the analysis of the pnc in cesium .",
    "breit and coulomb interaction were equally treated on the self - consistent field level ( hartree - fock and random - phase approximation calculations ) . however , inclusion of the breit interaction into calculation of the correlations was not comprehensive . in that work",
    "we included correlations by calculating the correlation potential @xmath9 for valence electrons , using it to calculate the so - called brueckner orbitals for the states of valence electrons , and then replacing hartree - fock orbitals by brueckner orbitals in the @xmath10 amplitude .",
    "brueckner orbitals were calculated with breit interaction included into self - consistent hartree - fock potential while correlation potential @xmath9 was calculated without inclusion of the breit interaction .    in present work",
    "we do one more step by including breit interaction into second - oder correlation potential @xmath9 thus achieving equal and comprehensive treatment of coulomb and breit interactions on levels up to second order of the many - body perturbation theory .",
    "we apply this approach to the calculation of the breit corrections to the pnc amplitudes in neutral cesium , thallium and francium as well as barium and radium positive ions .",
    "this is the full list of atoms and ions with one external electron above closed shells for which pnc measurements were done or planned .",
    "our calculations represent the most comprehensive treatment of the breit contribution to the pnc in many - electron atoms .",
    "the results for tl , ba@xmath4 , ra@xmath4 as well as for the @xmath6 transitions for cs and fr are presented for the first time .",
    "the method developed in present work is important not only for the pnc in many - electron atoms",
    ". it can be equally useful for calculation of breit interaction contribution to any observable values enhanced on short distances .",
    "these include magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine structure , isotope shift , t - odd effects , etc .",
    "we use the following form of the breit operator @xcite ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 is distance between electrons and @xmath14 is @xmath15-matrix of the corresponding electron .",
    "this is a low frequency limit of the relativistic correction to the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "it contains magnetic interaction and retardation .",
    "similar to coulomb interaction , breit interaction creates self - consistent breit potential @xmath16 here summation goes over all core states . in the case of closed - shell atoms ( like alkali atoms in the @xmath17 approximation ) direct term in breit potential vanishes ( first term in  ( [ vbreit ] ) ) and only second , exchange , term remains .",
    "hartree - fock hamiltonian has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the self - consistent potential created by electrons from the core . to achieve comprehensive treatment of the breit interaction potential @xmath19",
    "should be presented as a sum of coulomb and breit terms @xmath20 note that we write for simplicity nuclear potential in ( [ hfg ] ) as for point - like nucleus .",
    "however , our actual potential takes into account finite nuclear size .    to do pnc calculations one needs to take into account dipole interaction of an atom with external photon as well as weak interaction of atomic electrons with the nucleus .",
    "we use the time - dependent hartree - fock method ( tdhf ) to do this  @xcite .",
    "this method is equivalent to well - known random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .    for every electron in the atom , single electron wave function",
    "is presented in the form @xmath21 where index @xmath22 numerates single - electron states , @xmath23 is unperturbed wave function for the state @xmath22 which is an eigenstate of the hartree - fock hamiltonian  ( [ hfg ] ) , @xmath24 is correction to @xmath23 due to weak interaction with the nucleus , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are corrections due to electric field of external photon of frequency @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are corrections due to simultaneous action of the weak interaction and dipole interaction with external photon .",
    "corrections @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 to all atomic states found by self - consistent iteration of the tdhf equations : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is correction to the self - consistent hartree - fock potential @xmath19 due to external field ( weak ( @xmath32 ) , dipole electric ( @xmath33 ) or both ( @xmath34 ) ) . equations ( [ weak],[e1],[e1w ] ) are first solved self - consistently for states in the core . then corrections to valence states are calculated in the field of frozen core .",
    "pnc amplitude for the transition between valence states @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the tdhf approximation is @xmath37 breit interaction is included by using expression ( [ vcb ] ) for the self - consistent potential on all stages of the calculations . in other words , hartree - fock potential in the left - hand side of equations ( [ weak],[e1],[e1w ] ) is the sum of coulomb and breit terms .",
    "correction to the potential @xmath31 in the right - hand side of equations ( [ weak],[e1],[e1w],[tdhf ] ) is also the sum of coulomb and breit terms : @xmath38 expression ( [ tdhf ] ) does not take into account correlations . to include correlations we introduce correlation potential @xmath9 .",
    "it is defined in such a way that its average value over particular valence state @xmath35 is the correlation correction to the energy of this state ( see , e.g.  @xcite for details ) : @xmath39 @xmath9 is a non - local operator which depends on energy and parameter @xmath40 which defines the angular part of wave function @xmath41 : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is angular momentum and @xmath44 is total momentum of state @xmath35 .    in linear in @xmath9 approximation ,",
    "correlation correction to the pnc amplitude is @xmath45 in the most precise calculations of the pnc in cesium  @xcite , operator @xmath9 was calculated in all orders in coulomb interaction . for the purpose of the present work we can restrict ourself with the lowest , second - order expression for @xmath9 .",
    "corresponding brueckner - goldstone diagrams are presented on fig .",
    "[ sigma2 ] .",
    "breit interaction is included in calculation of @xmath9 in two ways .",
    "first , a complete set of single - electron states used to calculate @xmath9 was obtained with the use of the hartree - fock hamiltonian ( [ hfg ] ) with breit potential included as in eq .",
    "( [ vcb ] ) .",
    "second , inter - electron interaction in @xmath9 ( wave lines in all diagrams on fig .",
    "[ sigma2 ] ) is the sum of coulomb ( @xmath46 ) and breit ( [ hbreit ] ) terms .",
    "the total pnc amplitude in linear in @xmath9 approximation is @xmath47 we also use a more accurate way of calculating correlation corrections which includes correlation potential @xmath9 to all orders . we do this with the help of so - called brueckner orbitals  @xcite .",
    "brueckner orbitals are found by including @xmath9 into hartree - fock equations for valence states .",
    "for example , for the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 brueckner orbitals @xmath48 and @xmath48 and corresponding energies @xmath49 and @xmath50 are found by solving @xmath51 corrections @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 to brueckner orbital @xmath48 induced by weak and electromagnetic interactions are found by solving @xmath55 then , the all - order in @xmath9 pnc amplitude is given by the expression similar to ( [ tdhf ] ) but with hartree - fock orbitals replaces by brueckner orbitals : @xmath56 equations ( [ final ] ) and ( [ ecor ] ) differ by non - linear in @xmath9 terms ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc . ) .",
    "finally we note that non - perturbative treatment of breit interaction leads to inclusion of higher - order in breit operator terms , terms proportional to @xmath59,@xmath60 , etc . with @xmath61 given by ( [ hbreit ] ) .",
    "inclusion of these terms can not be justified since expression ( [ hbreit ] ) is already approximate .",
    "non - linear terms can be easily eliminated by a rescaling procedure . in this procedure",
    "inter - electron interaction is considered as a sum @xmath62 in which breit interaction @xmath61 is multiplied by a scaling parameter @xmath63 . by running programs for different values of @xmath63 a range of values",
    "is found for which final answer is linear function of @xmath63 .",
    "then the answer is interpolated to @xmath64 .",
    "it turns out , however , that as a rule @xmath64 is already in linear regime .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present our final results in table  [ comp ] together with the results of other authors .",
    "the results for the @xmath0 amplitude in cs and @xmath2 amplitude in fr are in good agreement with other calculations .",
    "however , we believe that our results are the most accurate due to non - perturbative treatment of the breit interaction which is complete up to second order of the mbpt .",
    "the results for other atoms as well as for the @xmath6 pnc amplitudes for cs and fr are presented for the first time .",
    "we now can use the result of this work for the breit interaction contribution and our previous calculations of other contributions to find the pnc amplitude in @xmath65cs , extract value of the weak charge and compare it with the standard model .",
    "our many - body calculations of the pnc amplitude produced by the electron - nucleus weak interaction gave the following result @xcite ( without the breit contribution and qed radiative corrections ) + @xmath66 .",
    "+ we take the breit contribution -0.0056 from this work and the qed radiative corrections -0.0029",
    "( -0.32 % of the pnc amplitude ) from ref .",
    "this gives @xmath67 in the experiment @xcite the ratio @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the vector transition polarizability , actually has been measured .",
    "to extract @xmath70 we used @xmath71 obtained in @xcite as the statistical average of the two most accurate values of @xmath69 . from the measurements of the pnc amplitude @xcite we obtain @xmath72 the difference with the standard model value @xmath73 @xcite is @xmath74 adding the errors in quadrature .",
    "thus , the difference between the central points is one standard deviation .",
    "for @xmath75tl we use pnc amplitude from ref .",
    "@xcite , + @xmath76 , + the qed radiative correction -0.57 % ( see detailes in @xcite ) , the neutron skin correction -0.3 % @xcite and the breit correction -0.92 % from this work .",
    "the result is @xmath77 using m1 amplitude 1.693 a.u . from @xcite and measurement @xcite @xmath78 a.u .",
    "we obtain for @xmath75tl @xmath79 the standard model value is -116.81(4 ) @xcite . the difference with the standard model for tl",
    "we have developed a method of non - perturbative treatment of the breit interaction in accurate calculations for many - electron atoms .",
    "the method has been applied to calculation of the breit correction to the pnc amplitudes of cs , ba@xmath4 , tl , fr and ra@xmath4 .",
    "the results for the @xmath0 amplitude in cs and @xmath2 amplitude in fr are in good agreement with other calculations .",
    "the results for other atoms and for the @xmath6 pnc amplitudes for cs and fr are presented for the first time .",
    "the following features of the breit correction to the pnc amplitudes have been revealed :    * the effect of correlations on the @xmath81 pnc amplitudes is small . *",
    "in contrast , correlations are important for those pnc amplitudes which depend on the @xmath82 weak matrix elements between valence states . * for accurate treatment of correlations inclusion of linear in the correlation potential @xmath9 terms",
    "is not enough .",
    "the main effect is due to the change in density of external electron inside the core which is magnified in higher orders in @xmath9 .",
    "it can be included by the use of brueckner orbitals . *",
    "inclusion of the breit interaction as well as higher - orders coulomb terms into correlation potential @xmath9 have only small effect on pnc amplitudes and can be neglected in most cases . * numerical cancellation of the effects of breit interaction on e1 transition amplitudes and energy denominators in the @xmath81 pnc amplitudes for cs and fr is rather fortunate .",
    "no such cancellation takes place for other atoms and for the @xmath6 amplitudes of cs and fr .",
    "the same is probably true for the radiative corrections to the pnc amplitudes .",
    "* rescaling of the breit correction to the pnc amplitudes using ratio of the nuclear charges @xmath83 can only be done to similar amplitudes in atoms with similar electron structure .",
    "combining breit corrections to pnc amplitudes in cesium and thallium with previous accurate calculations and measurements confirms good agreement of the weak nuclear charges of these atoms with the prediction of the standard model ."
