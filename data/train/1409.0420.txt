    "together with the continuity of probability currents @xmath17we have the symmetry relations@xmath18it indicates that for a hermitian scattering center , the asymmetry potential can not lead to transmission asymmetry .",
    "a natural question is whether a non - hermitian scattering center can lead to the asymmetrical transmission .",
    "before we answer this question we would like to point that serval types of non - hermitian scattering center can not be the candidate . this may provide a guidance for the diode design . to begin with , a parity symmetric non - hermitian scattering center should exhibit symmetric reflection and transmission . here",
    "the parity operator @xmath3  has the function @xmath19 .",

    "we propose a concrete example , a non - hermitian @xmath31-symmetric scattering center embedded in a one - dimensional tight - binding network , which exhibits perfect unidirectionality .",
    "inspired by the previous work @xcite and the analysis in above section , we start our design of diode scattering center by a simplest geometry , a three - site cluster . the threading flux and single on - site complex potential can destroy the @xmath3 symmetry as well as the @xmath0 symmetry . however , it possesses @xmath27-symmetry with the internal degree of freedom being the threading flux .",
    "the hamiltonian of the concerned scattering tight - binding network has the form@xmath38where@xmath39represent the left ( hl ) and right ( hr ) waveguides with real @xmath40 and@xmath41describes a non - hermitian scattering center , with the non - hermiticity arising from the complex potential @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows transmission and reflection profiles as a function of the wave number @xmath59 .",
    "the perfect asymmetric behavior with @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 , as expected , is observed .",
    "it shows that there is a relative wider region around @xmath35 , within which the system still exhibits the diode characteristic approximately .",
    "in this section , we will show that the occurrence of perfect unidirectionality  is related to the presence of a spectral singularity . to this end",
    ", we consider the solution of the hamiltonian@xmath63where@xmath64which is hermitian conjugation of @xmath65 .",
    "according to the pseudo - hermitian quantum mechanics @xcite , the eigenfunctions of @xmath65  and @xmath66can construct the complete biorthogonal basis except the case of spectral singularity , at which the complete biorthonormal set is spoiled . by the same procedure",
    ", the scattering wavefunctions can be obtained in the form    @xmath67    and@xmath68where@xmath69however , it becomes a little complicated when we consider the solution for @xmath70 .",
    "we find that the eigenfunctions with @xmath35  does not exist when the flux @xmath26  takes the value @xmath56 .",
    "we investigate the limit of @xmath71 and @xmath72 as @xmath73 along the following two paths : ( i ) @xmath74 , @xmath75  and ( ii ) @xmath74 , @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that two different paths gives unequal limits , i.e.,@xmath77we see that the transmission amplitude @xmath78 has a singularity at the point @xmath79 , which indicates that the bathe ansatz solution in eqs ( [ psil_dagger ] ) and ( [ psir_dagger ] ) do not exist .",
    "then the complete biorthogonality  of the eigenfunctions of @xmath65  and @xmath80  is destroyed at this point .",
    "we can also investigate this point from other way , taking the limits of @xmath71 and @xmath81 as @xmath82 along the following two paths : ( i ) @xmath83 , @xmath84  and ( ii ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 , respectively . to demonstrate the singularity , we plot @xmath87 as functions of @xmath26 for @xmath88 in fig .",
    "the profiles of the plots show clearly that the one - sided limits from the left and from the right for the real and imaginary parts are discontinuous and divergent at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "therefore we conclude that the perfect asymmetric transmission corresponds to the existence of the spectral singularity of the non - hermitian diode model .",
    "on the other hand , it is noted that the theory of spectral singularity for non - hermitian scattering center arising from pure complex potential has been well established @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the transfer matrix can be employed to identify the spectral singularity .",
    "we believe that this formalism is applicable on the discrete system . similarly , the eigenvalue equation @xmath91 yields the following asymptotic expressions for the eigenfunctions of @xmath65:@xmath92@xmath93 and @xmath94 are possibly @xmath59-dependent complex coefficients that are related by the so - called transfer matrix @xmath95 according to@xmath96the transfer matrix reveals almost complete features of the scattering center .",
