    "the observed properties of our universe on large  scales are very well reproduced by the current standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model @xcite . however , on small scales the paradigm faces a number of challenges that could be related to inherent model flaws or due to our poor understanding and modelling of the physical processes that affect galaxies on these scales .    a well known problem is the excess of low  mass dark matter halos compared with the actual number of visible low  mass galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy is commonly known as the cdm overabundance problem or missing satellite problem @xcite .",

    "we can classify the solutions to these problems in two types : those related to baryonic physics and those that propose changes in the nature of dark matter ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) . among the many baryonic effects considered we can mention photoheating during the reionization epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there are , in fact , three comparisons to be made : @xmath68 ) with all central galaxies ( including those without a stellar component , the coloured curves ) ; @xmath69 ) with central systems that host a luminous galaxy ( dashed black curve ) ; and @xmath70 ) with centrals and satellites hosting a luminous galaxy ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "one of the reasons to consider these three classes separately rests on our aim to establish if the hi contents of central galaxies ( in the field ) are consistent with observations , in particular in relation to gauging the impact of environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping on satellites .",
    "note that in all cases , at the high  mass end our simulation box is too small and does not contain enough galaxies , as evidenced by the large error bars in this figure .",
    "the first point to note is the relatively large scatter from simulation to simulation at intermediate masses for central galaxies , although all curves are consistent within 1@xmath37 of each other , and on average also consistent with the observed hi mass function .",
    "however , since most objects observed in the alfalfa survey actually have an optical counterpart ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a better comparison to make is to the dashed black curve , representing central luminous galaxies .",
    "we note the excellent agreement with the observations at these masses , although for masses @xmath71 , the predicted hi mass function appears to decline to a point that may be in tension with the observations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that satellite galaxies are present in the observational sample . as expected , when these are included in the predicted hi mass function , there is an increase in the number of objects although the agreement with the observations is still very reasonable .",
    "this implies that ram pressure stripping , although it should be included when modelling the properties of satellite galaxies , will not result in dramatic changes that will break - down the good agreement between the models and the observations , at least for the range of masses probed by the latter .",
    "more careful comparisons , especially regarding the low mass end of the hi mass function and the presence of systems without a stellar counterpart , are necessary",
    ". it will be important to have both deeper surveys in hi as well as in the optical , as these will allow us to establish whether the trends predicted are correct .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : props ] we have plotted the b  band absolute magnitude against the virial mass for all the 173 central galaxies in the high  resolution region of the aquarius halos .",
    "the panel below shows the hi mass against the virial mass for all these galaxies as red circles , while the open circles denote objects that according to our sa model have not formed any stars ( @xmath72 ) but do contain cold gas .",
    "there are 315 such objects with @xmath73 .",
    "the reason such systems do not form stars is because their surface gas density is below the threshold for star formation imposed by our model .",
    "an estimate of the dependence of the critical mass on the virial mass of objects can be obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcrit ] ) .",
    "in that equation , we replace the disk radial scalelength by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dimensionless spin parameter ( which we take to be @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 the virial radius of the host halo .",
    "as explained earlier , this scale is obtained assuming conservation of specific angular momentum , and that when hot gas cools at the centre of dark matter haloes , it settles in a rotationally supported disk @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath78 will typically be larger than @xmath31 , because the latter is a mass  weighted average over the whole gas cooling history of the system . therefore @xmath79 obtained in this way will be overestimated in general .",
    "nonetheless , this rough zero order approximation of the critical mass is plotted as the line in the bottom panel .",
    "this comparison serves to tentatively support our claim that the density of cold gas in lower mass objects is too low to allow star formation taking place .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that since the criterion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcrit ] ) for the critical mass of gas for star formation is strict and global , it is likely that if some stochasticity would be allowed and density variations inside a system considered , that some systems below the threshold should be able to form stars .",
    "this implies that the exact predictions for the shape of the hi mass function for objects around and below @xmath32 should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "this analysis supports the idea that ram pressure stripping of gas once a system becomes a satellite will not affect the properties of the objects significantly .",
    "most of the gas present in the systems has too low density to form stars , which is also why the luminosity function of galaxies ( including satellites ) is in agreement with observations , even if in our model , ram pressure has not really been implemented .",
    "for this reason , in the remainder of this paper we only focus on the behaviour of central galaxies .",

    "an additional important complementary aspect concerns the internal dynamics of galaxies , which links the galaxies to their host dark matter halos .",
    "a fundamental question that potentially relates to the nature of dark matter , is whether the galaxies in the sa model are hosted by the right dark matter halos in the simulations .",
    "this is why we now focus on velocity function , namely the abundance of galaxies with a given circular velocity @xcite . to measure circular velocities for large numbers of galaxies",
    "is challenging , but wide  area , single  dish 21  cm surveys are making this possible .",
    "although ideally one would like to obtain full rotation curves for a large number of systems spanning a large range in galaxy mass , this is too time  consuming to be currently feasible .",

    "negligible for these systems.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : image1 ]    in figure  [ fig : vmax_vrot ] we show the distribution of @xmath85 vs @xmath82 for this dataset ( grey solid points ) as well as for th central dark matter halos hosting our model galaxies ( red circles ) . with black open circles with indicate those systems in our model that have @xmath101 but @xmath99 , i.e. they are devoid of stars , and hence would not be in the observational compilation of @xcite .",
    "the blue curve shows the relation predicted by abundance matching according to @xcite .",
    "this comparison is extremely satisfactory and confirms again that model galaxies are placed in the right host dark matter halos .",
    "no discrepancies are found , and there is no evidence from this plot that the dark matter halos in the simulations would be too massive or too dense to host the observed galaxies .    however , this is in tension with the naive conclusion that one would have drawn from comparing the observations to the predictions of abundance matching .",
    "it is important therefore to understand why the galaxies in our model do not follow the predictions of abundance matching . equally important",
    "it is to understand why only halos with @xmath102 host luminous galaxies .",
    "the reason that abundance matching does not work at the low mass end of the halo spectrum is that the ability of a halo to host a galaxy depends on its capacity to i ) retain the baryons ; ii ) cool gas from the hot phase ; and iii ) have enough cold gas at high density for star formation .",
    "these conditions are redshift dependent , and hence the virial mass or velocity at the present  day are not sufficient to establish whether a halo will host a galaxy ( unless this mass is significantly different from the various thresholds ) . of the halos that are near the thresholds for these physical processes to take place , some fraction will satisfy these requirement , and this fraction is not fully random , and is not mass ranked ( as in abundance matching ) but depends on the specific history of the halo .",
    "this point is made clear by considering the fraction of central halos that host galaxies as a function of virial mass .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ fig : mass - fractions ] , where the fraction of galaxies with @xmath103 at a given @xmath36 is indicated by the solid line , and the fraction of systems with @xmath99 is given by the dashed line . from this figure",
    "we see that all halos with @xmath104 host luminous galaxies , while only @xmath105 of those with @xmath106 do . on the other hand , this function is shifted to lower masses if we consider the systems with cold gas : 50% of the halos with @xmath107 contain hi .",
    "this shift is present because , not only must a halo be able to cool gas but in order to form stars , this gas must be above the threshold for star formation .",
    "it is also interesting that these functions are not exactly steps , and this is a manifestation of the various processes at work which have different thresholds , as discussed above .",
    "( solid ) and halos with more than @xmath108 hi gas ( dashed ) as function of @xmath36 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : vmax_vvir ] shows the @xmath82 vs @xmath22 for the central model galaxies as red circles , the systems with no stars but with @xmath99 as open black circles , and the dark matter halos without baryons as grey crosses .",
    "this demonstrates clearly that virial velocity today @xmath22 is not enough to predict if a halo will host a luminous galaxy .",
    "it also shows that at a given @xmath22 , luminous galaxies are hosted in halos with higher @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that for a given @xmath22 these are the most concentrated halos since for a nfw halo : @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the concentration , with @xmath112 the scale radius of the halo .",
    "vs @xmath82 for the central dark matter halos hosting our model galaxies ( red circles ) , for systems in our model that have @xmath72 but @xmath99 ( black open circles ) and for completely dark halos ( grey crosses ) . ]",
    "these more concentrated halos will have typically collapsed earlier , implying that they reach a higher mass at earlier times which therefore increases their likelihood of being above e.g. the hi cooling limit at which point they can start forming stars if they have retained enough baryons ( after photoevaporation ) .",
    "this also explains why the hosts of luminous galaxies are to the left of the abundance matching curves , since @xmath113 where @xmath114 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fc ] ) with @xmath115 . in general",
    ", we can assume that @xmath116 ( i.e. @xmath117 ) , in which case @xmath118 , increases with increasing @xmath119 .",
    "this implies that for fixed @xmath31 , galaxies with smaller @xmath112 ( i.e. in more concentrated halos ) , have larger @xmath120 .",
    "in other words @xmath82 at fixed @xmath121 is lower for more concentrated halos .",
    "this highlights that for abundance matching to work , it is important to select halos that are most concentrated amongst those that are near the thresholds .",
    "figure [ fig : vmax_vvir ] shows that dark halos ( grey crosses ) have @xmath122 , which is consistent with the fact that the hi cooling limit is @xmath123 .",
    "( [ eq : vmax - vvir ] ) explains why basically all objects with @xmath124 are dark , as the function @xmath125 is weakly dependent on @xmath126 . since halos hosting luminous galaxies are on average in more concentrated halos as discussed above , their @xmath82 is higher as seen in this figure .",
    "we have used the high  resolution aquarius cosmological dark matter simulations in combination with the semi  analytic model by @xcite to study the hi content and dynamical properties of galaxies at the low mass end in the context of the paradigm .",
    "we have compared our predictions to the observed alfalfa survey , and found excellent agreement with the hi mass and velocity width functions measured by this survey for central galaxies , down to the lowest mass scales probed .",
    "implicit in this conclusion , is our assumption that luminous satellite galaxies do not contribute significantly to these hi distribution functions .",
    "this is based on the fact that even if these systems are considered when computing the model hi mass function , we still find good agreement with observations , and the same is true for the luminosity function .",
    "therefore , even if we do not include the effect of ram pressure stripping in our models explicitly , we argue that its effect will not lead to dramatic changes in the properties of galaxies . this is because the gas that is present in these systems is too diffuse to contribute to star formation , and hence have an impact on the evolution of these objects .",
    "we have also studied the relation between two global parameters of the circular velocity curves of the galaxies in our models and in the alfalfa survey , namely between their peak velocity and circular velocity at 2 radial disk scalelengths .",
    "the distribution found in our models overlaps perfectly with that inferred from observations .",
    "this suggests that our galaxies are placed in the right dark matter halos , and consequently and at face value we do not seem to find any discrepancy with the predictions from the model .",
    "our model predicts the existence of a population of hi halos that do not have a stellar counterpart ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the exact abundance of these objects is likely to depend rather strongly on the implementation of star formation in the models , including whether cooling below @xmath127 is allowed ( via @xmath128 ) and on the critical density floor for star formation .",
    "although these objects are relatively gas  rich , their cold gas is too diffuse .",
    "furthermore , their baryon fraction is well below universal , since typically @xmath129 , reflecting the fact that they lost an important fraction of baryons because of photoevaporation during reionization .",
