    "the decoupling of the self - diffusion constant from the viscosity or the structural relaxation time  also referred to as the breakdown of the stokes - einstein ( se ) relation  that occurs for temperatures @xmath0 near the glass transition temperature @xmath1 is among the most prominent features of fragile glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the decoupling has been considered as one of the signatures of spatially heterogeneous dynamics or `` dynamical heterogeneities ''  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also well recognized that the onset temperature @xmath2 of the decoupling is close to a crossover temperature at which transport properties change their characters  @xcite and below which the dynamics is thought to be dominated by activated hopping processes over barriers  @xcite .",
    "then , a natural question arises as to possible connections among the decoupling , dynamical heterogeneities , and the hopping processes . in this paper ,",
    "such connections are explored by extending the idealized mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for glass transition  @xcite .",
    "the idealized mct has been known as the most successful microscopic theory for glass transition . indeed , extensive tests of the theoretical predictions carried out so far against experimental data and computer - simulation results suggest that the theory deals properly with some essential features of glass - forming liquids  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a well - recognized limitation of the idealized mct is the predicted divergence of the @xmath3-relaxation time at a critical temperature @xmath4  also referred to as the nonergodic transition  which is not observed in experiments and computer simulations .",
    "an extended version of mct developed in ref .",
    "@xcite aims at incorporating activated hopping processes which smear out the sharp nonergodic transition and restore ergodicity for @xmath5 , but its applicability has been restricted to schematic models .",
    "this is because of the presence of the subtraction term in the expression for the hopping kernel , which violates the positiveness  a fundamental property  of any correlation spectrum .",
    "there have been relatively few other attempts to go beyond the idealized mct  @xcite , and incorporating the hopping processes into the theory for glass transition has been a major unsolved problem .",
    "we present here a new formulation which is motivated by ideas from the dynamical theory originally developed to describe diffusion - jump processes in crystals  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical - theory approach adapted in this work to glass - forming liquids treats hopping as arising from vibrational fluctuations in quasi - arrested state where particles are trapped inside their cages , and the hopping rate is formulated in terms of the debye - waller factors characterizing the structure of the quasi - arrested state .",
    "the resulting expression for the hopping rate takes an activated form , and the barrier height for the hopping is `` self - generated '' in the sense that it is present only in those states where the dynamics exhibits a well defined plateau .",
    "it will be discussed how such a hopping rate can be incorporated to develop a new extended version of mct .",
    "we will then investigate whether the developed theory accounts for the mentioned decoupling for @xmath6 .",
    "such an investigation makes sense since @xmath4 is also found to be close to @xmath7  @xcite , i.e. , the onset temperature of the decoupling  @xcite .",
    "it will also be examined whether our theory reproduces characteristic features of dynamical heterogeneities revealed by recent computer simulations .",
    "more specifically , we shall study whether the theory predicts a substantial increase of the non - gaussian parameter  @xcite , double - peak structure in the probability distribution of particle displacements  @xcite , and the presence of a growing dynamic length scale  @xcite , which the idealized mct failed to reproduce .",

    "<S> we develop a new extended version of the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for glass transition , which incorporates activated hopping processes via the dynamical theory originally formulated to describe diffusion - jump processes in crystals . the dynamical - theory approach adapted here to glass - forming liquids treats hopping as arising from vibrational fluctuations in quasi - arrested state where particles are trapped inside their cages , and the hopping rate is formulated in terms of the debye - waller factors characterizing the structure of the quasi - arrested state . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression for the hopping rate takes an activated form , and the barrier height for the hopping is `` self - generated '' in the sense that it is present only in those states where the dynamics exhibits a well defined plateau . </S>",
    "<S> it is discussed how such a hopping rate can be incorporated into mct so that the sharp nonergodic transition predicted by the idealized version of the theory is replaced by a rapid but smooth crossover . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the developed theory accounts for the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation observed in a variety of fragile glass formers . </S>",
    "<S> it is also demonstrated that characteristic features of dynamical heterogeneities revealed by recent computer simulations are reproduced by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , a substantial increase of the non - gaussian parameter , double - peak structure in the probability distribution of particle displacements , and the presence of a growing dynamic length scale are predicted by the extended mct developed here , which the idealized version of the theory failed to reproduce . </S>",
    "<S> these results of the theory are demonstrated for a model of the lennard - jones system , and are compared with related computer - simulation results and experimental data . </S>"
