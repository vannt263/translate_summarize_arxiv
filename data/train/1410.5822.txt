    "dwarf novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables with a type of close binary system consisting of a white dwarf and a late - type main - sequence ( secondary ) star .",
    "the matter lost from the secondary star filling its roche - lobe is transferred to the white dwarf via the lagrangian point l1 , and makes an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "one of the most peculiar events in dwarf novae are its sudden increases in brightness , described as ( normal ) outbursts .",
    "it is currently understood that these outbursts are triggered by thermal instability in the accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .    su ursae major ( su uma)-type dwarf novae are a subgroup of dwarf novae .",
    "these objects show two types of outburst : a normal outburst and a _",
    "superoutburst_. the superoutburst has a larger amplitude , by 0.20.4 mag , and a longer duration ( about 10 days ) than the normal outburst . during the superoutburst ,",
    "the object shows short - term periodic modulations , called _ superhumps _ , with an amplitude of about 0.30.4 mag , and with a period a few percent greater than the orbital period @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that this superoutburst is caused by the tidal instability of the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model describes that when a disk expands beyond the 3:1 resonance radius during a normal outburst , a tidal instability is excited .",
    "the disk is then deformed to an eccentric form by a strong tidal torque , and undergoes a slow precession ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the more effective tidal dissipation , caused by the deformed elliptical disk , leads to a bright superoutburst .",
    "wz sagittae ( wz sge)-type dwarf novae are an extreme subgroup of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the peculiarities of these objects are : ( 1 ) no normal outburst ; ( 2 ) a long superoutburst recurrence interval ( several years up to decades ) ; and ( 3 ) a larger superoutburst amplitude ( @xmath5 mag ) than in su uma - type objects .",
    "in addition , many ( but not all ) wz sge - type objects show two unique behaviors : ` early superhumps ' observed only in the very early phase of the superoutburst ; and post - superoutburst rebrightening @xcite .",
    "the early superhump is a modulation of brightness showing two peaks during a period that is almost the same as the orbital period ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to explain this modulation , @xcite proposed a model of a two - armed spiral structure excited by tidal dissipation produced by a 2:1 resonance .",
    "recently , simultaneous multicolor photometry of wz sge - type objects revealed that the color becomes red at the maximum of the early superhump ( v455 and : @xcite ; ot j012059.6 + 325545 : @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "published a model code to reconstruct the disk height structure from multicolor data on the assumption that early superhumps are caused by non - uniformity of disk height structure .",
    "the application of this code to both objects succeeded in reproducing the arm - like pattern in the reconstructed disk height map ( see @xcite for the case of v455 and , and @xcite for ot j012059.6 + 325545 ) .    rebrightening is a phenomenon where brightness increases again after the end of the main superoutburst .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in wz sge - type and some su uma - type objects @xcite , and is classified by light curve into three types : ( 1 ) single short type ; ( 2 ) short , repetitive rebrightening ; and ( 3 ) long - lived plateau type @xcite . as a mechanism for this rebrightening phenomenon ,",
    "two competing models have been proposed .",
    "one model is the _ ` mass reservoir model ' _ where rebrightening is caused by delayed accretion of gas left in the outermost region , expanded beyond the 3:1 resonance radius by the superoutburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the other model is the _ ` enhanced mass transfer model ' _ where rebrightening is caused by enhanced mass transfer from the secondary star irradiated by the accretion disk and central white dwarf , brightened by the superoutburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these models predict a different temporal evolution of the disk radius ; the former predicts a _ slow _ decrease , whereas the latter model predicts a _ rapid _ decrease .",
    "multicolor observations that provide information on the size of the emitting region can possibly evaluate these models .    in this paper",
    ", we report the results of our photometric and spectroscopic observations of wz sge - type dwarf nova ez lyncis ( ez lyn ) ( also known as sdss j080434.20 + 510349.1 ) during its 2010 superoutburst . from daily variations in brightness , color , and h@xmath3 line profile , we estimated the disk radius ratio ( ratio of the disk radius to the binary separation ) , compared it with that of the v455 andromedae ( v455 and , a wz sge - type object that did not show any rebrightening in the 2007 superoutburst ) , and discussed the difference between the two objects . from the short - term variations in brightness and color in a day , we calculated the variation of the emitting size and discussed the superhump source .",
    "ez lyn was discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found this object was in superoutburst in 2006 .",
    "although a lack of observation prevented detection of the early superhump , it was classified as a wz sge - type dwarf nova on the basis of the estimated amplitude of the superoutburst ( about 7 mag ) and rebrightening , which were detected 11 times ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in 2010 , this object caused a second superoutburst only 4 years after the first . in this superoutburst , ez lyn showed rebrightening on six occasions .",
    "the periods of early and ordinary superhumps were studied by @xcite . among wz sge - type stars ,",
    "ez lyn has several peculiarities : a short recurrence time ; brightenings and mini - outbursts during quiescence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and non - radial pulsations seen only during part of the post - outburst phase ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "when the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model was fit with observations in quiescence , the mass and surface temperature of the white dwarf in ez lyn were estimated at @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .    in section 2 ,",

    "we discuss our results in section 4 , and summarize our study in section 5 .",
    "ez lyn was observed both photometrically and spectroscopically .",
    "all of the observations were carried out using the araki telescope ( 1.3-m diameter ; f/10 ) at koyama astronomical observatory at kyoto - sangyo university , japan .",
    "the photometry of ez lyn was performed between september 18 , 2010 and january 7 , 2011 using a dual - band imager , adler ( araki telescope dual - band imager ) .",

    "ez lyn was observed with a 670nm - split dichroic mirror , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters . the seeing condition ( full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ) was 2.05.3 and 1.74.9 arcsec for @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , respectively .",
    "the observational data were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) with the standard techniques of photometry ( dark - subtraction , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry with noao.digiphot.daophot ) .",
    "we adopted three comparison stars : usno - b1 1410 - 0196618 ( c1 ) for almost all observations , usno - b1 1409 - 0197659 ( c2 ) for november 1 , 2010 and december 1 , 2010 , and usno - b1 1410 - 0196577 ( c3 ) for january 7 , 2011 .",

    "the color was bluer [ @xmath37 at @xmath3824 ] during the following rebrightening phase ( @xmath39 at @xmath3824 ) . in the slow declining phase ( @xmath40111 ) after the rebrightening , the color became bluer over time , more so than at the quiescent level .      in this section",
    ", we roughly estimate the temperature and size of the disk from the two - band photometric results . in general , dwarf novae have four continuum sources : a white dwarf ; an accretion disk ; a secondary star ; and a hot spot . during an outburst ,",
    "almost all of the optical emissions from a dwarf nova originate from the accretion disk ( see @xcite ) . on the basis of the standard disk theory ,",
    "the temperature varies with the radius , which is higher in the inner region and lower in the outer region .",
    "the continuum emission from the entire disk is a sum of blackbody radiations at rings with different radii , that is , with different temperatures .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite recently reported that from multicolor ( @xmath41 bands ) photometric results of the wz sge - type star v455 and , the continuum between the @xmath0 and @xmath42 bands during the superoutburst can be reproduced by a single blackbody function . since the inner disk region with higher temperature ( @xmath43 k ) g / s , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the mass of white dwarf @xmath44 , the inner disk radius @xmath45 cm , and the outer disk radius @xmath46 ( 2:1 resonance radius ) @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the radius of the white dwarf and the binary separation , respectively . ]",
    "emits most of its energy in the ultraviolet wavelength and the outer region with lower temperature ( @xmath50 k ) emits in the optical wavelength , this result indicates that the optical continuum of wz sge - type objects during the superoutburst is emitted mostly from the outermost region of the disk having the lowest temperature in the disk .",
    "thus , we fitted @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes with a single blackbody function and considered the derived temperature and size information as those of the outermost region of the disk , as an approximation .",
    "the procedure for obtaining the temperature and size information was as follows .",
    "first , we calculated the energy of the radiation at @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands in flux from the observed magnitudes , and obtained the sed of ez lyn .",
    "second , we fitted this sed with a single blackbody function , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is wavelength , @xmath53 is the size information that is proportional to the emitting area @xmath49 as @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the distance between the observer and the object ) , and @xmath56 is related to temperature @xmath57 by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the planck constant , @xmath60 is the speed of light , and @xmath61 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "finally , we calculated the temperature and size ratio of the emitting region from the best fit values of the free parameters @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , the errors in the free parameters could not be obtained by the above procedure because the fitting of only two data ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 magnitudes ) with two free parameters had no degree of freedom ( @xmath62 ) . to estimate the errors , we generated pseudo data ( 1,000 ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes using the monte carlo method , following gaussian distributions whose averages and standard deviations were observed magnitudes and their errors , applied the above procedure to the pseudo data ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 ) , calculated the average and standard deviation ( strictly the square root of the unbiased variance ) for the derived 1,000 parameter set ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath65 ) , and considered the average and the standard deviation as the best fit value and the error of the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "this result is consistent with those using 10,000 pseudo - data .",
    "figure [ fig : d - gtra ] shows the temporal evolution of @xmath0 magnitude , the temperature , and size ratio during the 2010 superoutburst .",
    "the size ratio is normalized to that at @xmath33 when the brightness is very close to the quiescent level . during the main superoutburst ( @xmath3513 ) and rebrightening phases ( @xmath6828 ) , the temperature and size of the emitting region decreased as brightness faded . during the slow decline phase ( @xmath69111 ) , the size decreased monotonically over time , whereas the temperature was at first very low but increased over time , and was finally hotter than at the quiescent phase . at @xmath33 ,",
    "the size of the emitting region agreed with that during the quiescent phase .",
    "we consider the evolution in the slow decline phase as an estimation , because our approximation of single blackbody radiation was not valid at this phase , and the additional contribution of emission sources , such as a hot spot was expected .      in section [ section : temp+size_photometry ]",
    ", we estimated the size ratio of the emitting region from @xmath0- and @xmath1- band magnitudes . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the ratio of the accretion disk radius @xmath70 to the binary separation @xmath49 ( disk radius ratio @xmath71 ) of ez lyn from the estimated size ratio , and compare it to that of another wz sge - type object , v455 and , which was also fortunately observed from the rapid rising state @xcite and did not show a rebrightening during the 2007 superoutburst . for this calculation",
    ", we assumed that the size of the emitting region was proportional to the square of the disk radius , and that the disk radius ratio of both objects at the maximum was equal to that of 2:1 resonance .",

    "we used only @xmath0- and @xmath75- band data in the same manner as ez lyn , because the @xmath75 band had the most similar effective wavelength to the @xmath1 band among the five bands . at @xmath35 and 1 , when v455 and",

    "@xmath76 was scaled by the results at @xmath77 when photometry was carried out with both pairs , using the formula , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the size parameter of blackbody fit derived from a pair of @xmath72- and @xmath42- band data .",
    "the derived disk radius is thought to represent that of the optically thick region in the accretion disk .",
    "in addition , the emissivity in the optically thick region depends only on the surface temperature at the emitting region .",
    "figure [ fig : days_vs_disk_radius ] shows that the disk radius ratio of ez lyn during the main superoutburst ( @xmath3513 ) decreases more slowly ( @xmath80day@xmath81 ) than that of v455 and during the same phase ( @xmath82day@xmath81 , @xmath3516 ) .",
    "in addition , the disk radius ratio of ez lyn at the end of the main superoutburst ( 0.26 at @xmath83 ) is larger than that of v455 and ( 0.13 at @xmath84 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the accretion process in ez lyn works less effectively , and that there is a greater amount of gas left in the outermost region of the disk , than in v455 and .",
    "there are two competing models to explain the rebrightening phenomenon : the mass reservoir model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and the enhanced mass transfer ( emt ) model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as described in section 1 , the emt model predicts a _ rapid _ decrease in disk radius because the gas transferred from the secondary star has low angular momentum .",
    "in contrast , the mass reservoir model assumes that the rebrightening is caused by delayed accretion of gas left in the outermost region beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , and expects a _ slow _ decrease in disk radius and a large disk radius at the end of the main superoutburst .",
    "our results favor the mass reservoir model rather than the emt model .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_all+ha_zoom ] shows the spectral evolution during the superoutburst .",
    "each spectrum is normalized to a unity continuum value , and is shifted by 0.3 to the vertical direction for visibility . in the left panel h@xmath3 ,",

    "in contrast , @xcite reports that he and c / n lines are detected in wz sge 2001 superoutburst even during the mid - plateau phase , with peak intensity at about 0.1 to the continuum level .",
    "this indicates that the ez lyn 2010 superoutburst was less energetic than the wz sge 2001 superoutburst . according to @xcite ,",
    "ez lyn is a grazing , eclipsing system whose orbital inclination angle is similar to wz sge ( @xmath85 , @xcite and references therein ) . according to @xcite",
    ", the standard disk model indicates that the boundary layer ( bl ) has the highest temperature in the binary system , and the non - detection of high ionization lines indicates that the bl of ez lyn has a lower temperature than that of wz sge .",
    "the temperature of bl , @xmath86 , depends on the mass of the white dwarf @xmath87 , the radius of the boundary region @xmath88 , and the mass accretion rate in the disk @xmath89 as @xmath90 ( eq .",
    "2.55b in @xcite ) . considering these parameters , @xcite suggested that ez lyn has a massive white dwarf similar to the estimation of wz sge ( @xcite ) .",
    "if these estimations are reliable , the low bl temperature of ez lyn is caused either by the disk having a cavity in the innermost region ( large @xmath88 ) , or by the mass transfer rate in the disk being smaller than that of wz sge ( small @xmath89 ) .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : spec_all+ha_zoom ] shows the line profile evolution of h@xmath3 .",
    "the profile evolved from the combination of blue absorption and red emission components ( @xmath91 ) to the broad and bell - shaped emission component ( @xmath9224 ) .",
    "in particular , the profile at @xmath92 clearly indicated a double , peak - like feature .",
    "it is widely accepted that an emission line with a double - peak profile ( e.g. @xcite ) is from an accretion disk with a large orbital inclination angle .",
    "thus , we tried to fit this profile with two gaussian functions , and compared the results of the two functions with a single gaussian curve fitted to the observed profile ( figure [ fig : spec_ha_profile_t13 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : spec_ha_profile_t13 ] and @xmath97 , we confirmed that the two - gaussian curve can reproduce the observed profile much better than the single one .",
    "thus , it can be considered that emissions originating from the disk are dominant during the superoutburst , as in the quiescent phase ( @xcite ) .    to obtain the disk size information from h@xmath3 line",

    "this photometry enabled us to study the color variations caused by early and ordinary superhumps .",
    "to see small variations , we calculated phase - averaged light curves for each night .",

    "note that a periodicity of the color variation was not confirmed by short duration of our observation covering approximately one orbital period . on the basis of both color behaviors and amplitudes ,",
    "however , we can conclude that ez lyn is the third system where the color variation was successfully observed in early superhumps , next to v455 and @xcite and ot j012059.6 + 325545 @xcite .",

    "the object was bluest at the superhump minimum .",
    "as the object increased in brightness , the color became redder .",
    "although the profile of the @xmath0-band light curve changes over time , these color behaviors are common in @xmath9113 .    on the basis of the folded color variation",
    ", we studied the physical property of the superhump source , using a similar method as that adopted by @xcite .",
    "if the early and ordinary superhumps are located at the outer part of the accretion disk , the system should have at least two emission components ( inner constant and outer variable ) .",
    "however , it was difficult for our data to separate both components without any assumptions .",
    "thus , we performed an analysis with the simplest model , the single blackbody emission component model , the same as in section [ section : temp+size_photometry ] .",
    "this model assumes that the superhump is caused by the entire disk .",
    "we also performed the analysis with a two - component model under several assumptions .",
    "the result is shown in section [ section : two_components_fit ] .",
    "figure [ fig : eshp+shp_vs_g+ra+t_t0 - 13 ] shows the temporal variations in the parameters of our model for early and ordinary superhumps .",
    "the top panels display the folded @xmath0-band light curves and @xmath2 color variations .",
    "the middle and bottom panels display the estimated temperature and the size of the blackbody emission region , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : eshp+shp_vs_g+ra+t_t0 - 13]a shows the result for the early superhump . from approximately the minimum to the first hump ( phase between @xmath110 and 0.10 ) , the temperature was higher and the emitting size smaller than those at the hump maximum .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-band light curve correlated well with the emitting size .",
    "these properties are roughly the same as those seen in v455 and ( @xcite ) , which supports the idea that _ the early superhump light source was a vertically expanded low - temperature region at the outermost part of the disk _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : eshp+shp_vs_g+ra+t_t0 - 13]b  d displays the results for the ordinary superhump . the temperature decreased as the emitting size increased , was lowest around the phase when the emitting size was at its maximum , and increased as the size decreased .",
    "this clear anticorrelation indicates that the superhump source has a lower temperature than other regions in the disk , and that the superhump is caused by the expansion of this low temperature region .",
    "in section [ section : the_size_of_disk ] , we calculated the disk radius ratios of both ez lyn and v455 and from the size parameters of blackbody fit . for this calculation , we assumed that the size of the emitting region @xmath111 is proportional to the square of the disk radius ( @xmath112 ) , and that the disk radius ratio at the maximum is equal to that of the 2:1 resonance . in this section",
    ", we discuss the effect of these assumptions on the results of the comparison between ez lyn and v455 and .",
    "first , the assumption that the size depends on the disk radius does not affect the results , if both objects have the same function for the size @xmath111 .",
    "this is because the order in size between both objects is unchanged under the same function .",
    "second , we assumed that the disk radius ratio at its maximum , @xmath113 , was the same between both objects and is equal to that of the 2:1 resonance radius , @xmath114 .",
    "even if the disk radius ratio at its maximum differed from that of the 2:1 resonance radius , our result would not be affected by this assumption , as the disk radius ratio of both objects , at maximum , is the same .",
    "it is possible that the maximum disk radius ratio differs between the two objects .",
    "however , since the disk radius ratio of v455 and at the end of the main superoutburst is about half that of ez lyn , to create the condition that v455 and has a larger disk radius ratio than ez lyn , requires the disk radius of v455 and ( at the maximum brightness ) to exceed the binary separation , @xmath115 , which is very unlikely to occur .",
    "consequently , we concluded that our results in section [ section : the_size_of_disk ] were not affected by the assumptions .      in section [ section : the_size_of_disk ] , we used @xmath72 and @xmath42 bands instead of @xmath0 and @xmath75 to estimate the disk radius ratio of v455 and at @xmath351 . in this section",
    ", we discuss the effect of this on the variation of the disk radius ratio of v455 and and on the comparison of this ratio with that of ez lyn .",
    "if the disk is an ideal blackbody emitter with a uniform temperature , the result derived by @xmath72 and @xmath42 bands would be the same as that by @xmath0 and @xmath75 bands . in practice , however , since the disk has a multiple temperature structure , it is expected that the results by @xmath72 and @xmath42 bands would differ from that by @xmath28 and @xmath75 bands .",
    "the comparison of results by @xmath72 and @xmath42 with those by @xmath0 and @xmath75 bands at @xmath775 , when all of these bands are observed , reveals that the amplitude of the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath75 bands is 15% larger in size ratio and 7% larger in disk radius ratio than that of @xmath72 and @xmath42 bands .",
    "if this result holds for the variation at @xmath352 with the same rate for @xmath32 , the disk radius of @xmath0 and @xmath116 bands at @xmath35 is about 5% larger than that estimated by eq.(2 ) .",
    "this consequently means that the speed of decrease of the disk radius ratio of v455 and is about 5% more rapid than that portrayed in figure [ fig : days_vs_disk_radius ] , and that the disk radius ratio at the end of the main superoutburst is also about 5% smaller than that in figure [ fig : days_vs_disk_radius ] .",
    "this increases the differences in both values between ez lyn and v455 and .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the usage of @xmath72 and @xmath42 bands does _ not _ affect our conclusion in section [ section : the_size_of_disk ] .",
    "the separation of the two peaks in the h@xmath3 line profile also enables us to estimate the disk radius @xcite .",
    "this estimation requires the white dwarf mass @xmath87 , orbital period @xmath117 , orbital inclination angle @xmath30 , and the mass ratio of the secondary star to the white dwarf @xmath118 .",
    "since the eclipse feature was shown in the light curve during the superoutburst but was not clearly shown during the quiescent phase , we adopted @xmath119 , which is a similar angle to wz sge ( @xmath120 , @xcite and reference therein ) . for the mass ratio @xmath118",
    ", we adopted @xmath121 , estimated by the relation between the superhump excess @xmath122 and the mass ratio @xcite and by @xmath123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital period of ez lyn is @xmath124d derived by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath125 , a typical mass for a white dwarf .",
    "the disk radius ratio @xmath71 is @xmath126 which is derived from the combination of equilibrium between gravitation and centrifugal force , @xmath127 and kepler s third law , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the gravitational constant .",
    "eq.(3 ) indicates that the disk radius ratio increases with @xmath87 and/or with @xmath30 .",
    "the estimated disk radius ratio was also plotted in figure [ fig : days_vs_disk_radius ] . under this assumption ,",
    "the disk radius ratio by h@xmath3 line at @xmath92 was estimated as 0.62 , larger than that of the photometric disk on the same day ( 0.38 ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the accretion disk of optically thin gas was more widely extended within the roche - lobe than that of optically thick gas .",
    "the disk radius ratio by h@xmath3 , however , depends strongly on @xmath87 and @xmath30 .",
    "for example , it requires @xmath130 or @xmath131 from eq.(3 ) to make the size of the h@xmath3 disk at @xmath92 equal to the photometric one .",
    "such a low inclination is difficult to accept because ez lyn shows an eclipse feature in the light curve during the superoutburst @xcite , which strongly suggests @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , such a small mass for the white dwarf in ez lyn is also unrealistic because @xcite suggests that ez lyn has a massive white dwarf ( @xmath133 ) on the basis of the sed model fitting to the optical and near - infrared observation .",
    "if the h@xmath3-disk radius truly has a larger size than the photometric one , it would be a consequence that optically thin gases in this h@xmath3 disk are associated with the matter remaining in the outermost region of the accretion disk and are responsible for the rebrightening phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , if that is true , the result that the h@xmath3 disk remained constant in size during @xmath9224 can be explained by gas in the outermost region remaining in abundance and being responsible for rebrightening continuing to at least @xmath134 ( figure [ fig : lc_gi_ave1n ] ) .      with regard to the photometric disk radius ,",
    "v455 and s ( no rebrightening system ) disk more rapidly decreases in size over time than that of ez lyn with rebrightening .",
    "this indicates that accretion from the outer to the central region occurred more effectively in v455 and than in ez lyn .",
    "there are two possible reasons : ( 1 ) the viscosity in the hot state is higher in v455 and ; or ( 2 ) the angular momentum of gas in the outermost disk region is more effectively extracted by the secondary star in v455 and .",
    "since the source of viscosity is not clearly understood , we do not consider ( 1 ) .",
    "the physical properties of both systems are summarized in table [ tab : system_info_v455and_vs_ezlyn ] . as shown in this table , v455 and has a larger @xmath118 and smaller @xmath117 than ez lyn . since it is considered that the tidal extraction of angular momentum from the disk by the secondary star is more effective in the system with larger @xmath118 and smaller @xmath117 @xcite , the second possibility seems more plausible , although the first is not excluded .",
    "we note that we have only two samples ; more are required to discuss the cause of effective extraction of angular momentum .      in section [ section :",
    "early_ordinary_superhumps ] , we modeled one emission component for early and ordinary superhumps , which means that humps represent changes in the temperature and size of the entire disk . in this section",
    ", we consider a model of two emission components , variable and constant ones , in the same manner as @xcite , and discuss the effect of the constant component on the results .",
    "we assume that both constant and variable components have the same temperature at the hump minimum , and the temperature of the constant component is not changed during superhumps . under this assumption ,",
    "we fit the model for early and ordinary superhumps with the flux of the constant component contributing 40% and 80% of total flux at the hump minimum .",
    "the formula for the sed of this two - component model is @xmath135 , where @xmath136 denotes the superhump phase , @xmath88 is the ratio of the flux of the constant component to the total flux at the hump minimum , and @xmath137 is the temperature at the hump minimum for the one component model .",
    "figure [ fig : wa_vs_flux_const0 + 80p_t0 + 7_2comp ] displays the examples of the observed and model seds .",
    "the panels in ( a ) are the seds at @xmath35 when the early superhumps were observed , and the panels in ( b ) are those at @xmath91 when the ordinary superhumps were observed . in these panels ,",
    "the left ones display the seds at the hump minimum , the right ones those at the hump maximum , the upper ones those of the models with the constant component contributing 0% , and the lower ones are those with it contributing 80% .",
    "we note that the 0% model seds are the same as those of the one component model reported in section [ section : early_ordinary_superhumps ] .",
    "figure [ fig : eshp+shp_vs_g+ra+t_t0 - 13_2comp ] shows the temporal variation of the model parameters for the hump component .",
    "the top , middle and bottom panels show the same as figure [ fig : eshp+shp_vs_g+ra+t_t0 - 13 ] , except for excluding the color variation in the top panel .",
    "the open circles , filled squares and open triangles plot the results of constant components contributing 0% , 40% , and 80% of the total flux at the @xmath0 hump minimum , respectively . although models with a larger contribution of the constant component showed a larger amplitude in variations in both temperature and size , its profile of variations was qualitatively the same in all cases .",
    "this was also concluded by @xcite .    from the amplitude of the size",
    ", we roughly estimated the thickness of the disk at the superhump source , using a simple model of two dimensions . in the case",
    "of the 80% contribution model , the size expanded 1.8-fold , and over 3-fold from the hump minimum for the early and ordinary superhumps , respectively .",
    "early superhumps are proposed to be variations caused by vertical deformation of the disk @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can estimate the height , @xmath59 , at the outermost region of the disk required to reproduce the 1.8-fold expansion of the apparent emitting area .",
    "for this estimation , we suppose the accretion disk to take cylindrical form , and consider that we see a flat part ( @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the disk radius ) of the disk with an inclination of @xmath140 at the hump minimum .",
    "the emitting size at the hump minimum is described by @xmath141 , where the first term is the projected area of the disk surface and the second term is the projected cross - sectional area of the lateral face of the disk . at the hump maximum",
    ", we see a vertically expanded part whose emitting size is @xmath142 . with this simple model and with the result @xmath143",
    ", we calculated the height to be @xmath144 at the hump maximum .",
    "this height is too large to be explained within the framework of the standard accretion disk model ( @xmath145 : @xcite ) .",
    "however , the 0% contribution model yields @xmath146 , slightly higher than the standard model .",
    "these results support the indication discussed in @xcite ; the contribution of the constant component in the inner disk should be small in the optical regime .      as shown in section [ section : early_ordinary_superhumps ] , the color variation in the ordinary superhumps of ez lyn is clearly anticorrelated with brightness .",
    "this color variation is different from that of v455 and ; ez lyn is reddest at minimum brightness , becomes bluer with increasing brightness , reaches its bluest before its peak of brightness , and reddens with a further increase in brightness .",
    "@xcite interpreted the variation in v455 and ; at the brightening phase of the superhump , the increase in disk temperature is caused by a viscous heating effect .",
    "after the heating stopped , the object entered an expansion - cooling phase .    as a possible cause of the color - variation difference",
    ", there are several system parameters , including the orbital inclination angle @xmath30 and disk radius ratio @xmath71 . among these parameters",
    ", @xmath30 can be rejected because @xcite estimated the orbital inclination of v455 and as @xmath119 , on the basis of the presence of shallow eclipses in its quiescent light curve , which is almost the same as that of ez lyn .",
    "the mass ratio and orbital period are also not critically different between the systems , as summarized in table [ tab : system_info_v455and_vs_ezlyn ] . on the other hand , the photometric disk radius ( when ordinary superhumps are observed ) is clearly different ; ez lyn has a larger disk radius ratio ( @xmath147 ) than v455 and ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "a larger disk radius ratio is thought to make the timescale of heating and expansion longer , which may cause the difference in color variation .",
    "the color variation in the superhumps is a good tool to study the superhump light source .",
    "however , as far as we know , there are only four examples of such a color study performed by high accuracy multi - color photometric observation using ccd camera on su uma - type dwarf nova : wx cet ( @xcite ) ; v455 and ( @xcite ) ; su uma ( superhump - like modulation seen in the normal outburst , @xcite and @xcite ) ; and ez lyn .",
    "the number of samples should be increased through further observation .",
    "we performed optical dual - band photometry and spectroscopy for the wz sge - type dwarf nova ez lyn during the 2010 superoutburst .",
    "our studies are summarized as follows :    * dual - band photometry revealed that the color @xmath2 was redder with the object being fainter during the main superoutburst and following the rebrightening phase ( @xmath3528 ) . during the slow declining phase ( @xmath40111 ) after the rebrightening , the color became bluer over time and bluer than in quiescence .",
    "* we estimated the temperature and size ratio of the emitting region from @xmath0- and @xmath1- band data using a single blackbody function , and calculated the disk radius ratio from the size ratio , with noted assumptions .",
    "comparison of the temporal evolution of the disk radius ratios between ez lyn and v455 and ( no rebrightening system ) revealed : ( 1 ) the decrease speed of the disk radius ratio of ez lyn was slower than that of v455 and ; and ( 2 ) the radius ratio of ez lyn just at the end of the main superoutburst was larger than that of v455 and .",
    "these results indicate that the accretion process in ez lyn was less effective than in v455 and , and a greater amount of gas was left in the outermost region of the disk than in v455 and , which favors the mass reservoir model for the mechanism of rebrightening . * from spectroscopy during both the superoutburst plateau and the subsequent rebrightening phase , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and possibly he @xmath52447.1 nm lines",
    "were detected , whereas high ionization lines such as he @xmath52468.6 nm and bowen blend c / n around @xmath52464 nm were not detected . *",
    "the h@xmath3 emission line shows a double - peak profile as seen in the quiescent phase .",
    "* we estimated the disk radius ratio from the h@xmath3 line profile with several assumptions , and compared it to that derived by photometry .",
    "the comparison reveals that the h@xmath3 disk radius ratio was larger than that derived by photometry .",
    "this result suggests that optically thin gas was extended to the outer region further than the optically thick ( photometric ) disk .",
    "this optically thin gas is a possible energy source for the rebrightening observed .",
    "* early superhumps in ez lyn show roughly the same color behavior as those of v455 and and ot j012059.6 + 325545 . *",
    "ordinary superhumps in ez lyn show a clear anticorrelation between color and brightness , in contrast to that seen in v455 and .",
    "this difference was possibly caused by the difference in the disk size when the ordinary superhump was excited , although the possibility of other system parameters such as orbital inclination , mass ratio , or orbital period are not excluded . to study",
    "the cause of this diversity would require a greater number of samples of high accuracy multi - color observation .",
