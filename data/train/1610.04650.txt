    "after the discovery of topological insulators , topological aspects of free - fermion systems have been extensively studied.@xcite in these systems , the ground state wave function has topologically nontrivial properties which can be characterized with topological invariants calculated from the bloch wave function .",
    "nontrivial topology ( , or a nontrivial value of topological invariant ) in the bulk predicts gapless edge modes , which is known as the bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "the presence of these gapless edge modes is a source of characteristic magneto - electric responses .",
    "furthermore , gapless edge modes in the topological superconductor are described as majorana fermions whose experimental realization has been addressed for one - dimensional quantum wires , recently.@xcite    in parallel with study of free - fermion systems , topological insulators for strongly correlated compounds have been proposed.@xcite the first principles calculation has pointed out that @xmath0 can be a strong topological insulator.@xcite furthermore , correlation effects on topological insulators are expected to induce novel phenomena .",
    "these facts urge us to study correlation effects on topological insulators .    for analysis of topological insulators with electron interactions ,",
    "a topological invariant defined in the bulk plays an important role . in non - interacting systems",
    ", this quantity can be calculated from the bloch wave function .",
    "the topological invariant for free - fermion systems can be extended to interacting systems.@xcite even though the bloch wave function is no longer well - defined in interacting systems , the single - particle green s function is still available .",
    "thus , the topological invariant can be defined with the green s function , which means that the group structure of topological insulators ( e.g. , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) is the same as that of the non - interacting case .",
    "interestingly , however , it is reported that the interactions can induce the reduction of topological classification of free - fermion systems.@xcite namely , at the non - interacting level , topological insulators / superconductors labeled by integers show gapless edge modes due to nontrivial properties , while gapless edge modes in some of these topological insulators / superconductors can be gapped out without symmetry breaking under electron interactions .",
    "this means that some of topological insulators / superconductors at the non - interacting level become topologically trivial in the presence of interactions , resulting in the reduction of topological classification .",
    "the reduction of topological classification has been mainly analyzed in terms of symmetry protection of edge modes at zero temperature .",
    "now , one may ask the following three questions .",
    "( i ) how the topological invariant defined by the green s function behaves if the reduction of topological classification occurs ?",
    "does it still take a nontrivial value ?",
    "( ii ) if the topological invariant of the green s function is well - defined and takes a nontrivial value , how this nontrivial value in the bulk becomes consistent in the absence of the gapless edge modes ?",
    "( iii ) what are temperature effects on the reduction of topological classification ?",
    "the analysis at finite temperatures is desired because all of experiments are carried out there .    in this paper , we address these three questions by analyzing a correlated weak topological insulator in two dimensions .",
    "the topological structure is characterized by the winding number at the non - interacting level , which is also well - defined even in correlated systems .",
    "our analysis based on the real - space dynamical mean field theory with continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( r - dmft+ctqmc ) elucidates the following facts .",
    "first , the winding number can take a nontrivial value even when the reduction of topological classification occurs .",
    "second , the system shows a mott behavior ( i.e. , the divergence of the self - energy ) only around the edge , signaling the reduction of topological classification .",
    "third , temperature effects result in a gradual crossover in gapless edge modes .",
    "namely , the behavior of edge modes changes with increasing temperature from zero temperature : starting from the absence of gapless excitations , gapless spin excitations emerge at slightly higher temperatures , which finally leads to single - particle gapless excitations in the higher temperature region .",

    "<S> ( i ) even when the reduction occurs , the winding number defined by the green s function can take a nontrivial value at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the winding number taking the nontrivial value becomes consistent with the absence of gapless edge modes due to mott behaviors emerging only at the edges . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) temperature effects can restore the gapless edge modes , provided that the energy scale of interactions is smaller than the bulk gap . in addition , we observe the topological edge mott behavior only in some finite temperature region . </S>"
