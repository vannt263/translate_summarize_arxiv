    "in this note we continue our investigations of the mathematical foundations of _ reflection positivity _ , a basic concept in constructive quantum field theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "originally , reflection positivity , also called osterwalder  schrader positivity , arises as a requirement on the euclidean side to establish a duality between euclidean and relativistic quantum field theories ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is closely related to `` wick rotations '' or `` analytic continuation '' in the time variable from the real to the imaginary axis .",
    "the underlying fundamental concept is that of a _ reflection positive hilbert space _ , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is a triple @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a hilbert space , @xmath6 is a unitary involution and @xmath7 is a closed subspace of @xmath5 which is @xmath8-positive in the sense that the hermitian form @xmath9 is positive semidefinite on @xmath7 .",
    "we write @xmath10 for the scalar product in a complex hilbert space and we assume that it is linear in the _ first _ argument .    let @xmath11 , write @xmath12 for the hilbert space completion of the quotient @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the canonical map . if @xmath15 is a linear or antilinear operator with @xmath16 , then there exists a well - defined operator @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the  @xmath20  is the _ os - quantization functor . _    to see how this relates to group representations , let us call a triple @xmath21 a _ symmetric lie group _ if @xmath22 is a lie group , @xmath23 is an involutive automorphism of @xmath22 and @xmath24 is an open subgroup of the group @xmath25 of @xmath23-fixed points .",
    "then the lie algebra @xmath26 of @xmath22 decomposes into @xmath23-eigenspaces @xmath27 and we obtain the _ cartan dual lie algebra _ @xmath28 . if @xmath21 is a symmetric lie group and @xmath4 a reflection positive hilbert space , then we say that a unitary representation @xmath29 is _ reflection positive with respect to @xmath21 _ if the following three conditions hold :    @xmath30 for every @xmath31 .",

    "there exists a subspace @xmath34 , dense in @xmath7 , such that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .    a typical source of reflection positive representations",

    "however , we would like to have a unitary representation @xmath55 of the simply connected lie group @xmath56 with lie algebra @xmath57 on @xmath12 extending @xmath58 in such a way that the derived representation is compatible with the operators @xmath59 , @xmath60 , that we obtain from ( rp3 ) on a dense subspace of  @xmath12 .",
    "if such a representation exists , then we call @xmath61 a _",

    "in @xcite we studied reflection positive one - parameter groups and hermitian contractive semigroups as one key to reflection positivity for more general symmetric lie groups and their representations . here",
    "a crucial point is that , for every unitary one - parameter group @xmath66 with @xmath67 on the hilbert space @xmath40 , we obtain by @xmath68 a @xmath69-valued function on @xmath70 which is reflection positive for @xmath71 and which leads to a euclidean realization of @xmath3 . from this",
    "we derive that all representations of the @xmath72-group , resp .",
    ", the heisenberg group which satisfy the positive spectrum condition for the translation group , resp . , the center , possess natural euclidean realizations .",
    "the present note grew out of the attempt to extract the representation theoretic aspects from the discussion of reflection positivity for the circle group @xmath73 in @xcite .",
    "here we continue our project by exploring reflection positive functions @xmath74 for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a half circle .",
    "this leads us naturally to anti - unitary involutions , an aspect that did not show up for triples @xmath78 , where @xmath46 is a semigroup .",
    "we start in section  [ sec:2 ] with a discussion of the integral representation of reflection positive operator - valued functions for @xmath75 due to klein and landau ( @xcite ) and in section  [ sec:3 ] we characterize those unitary one - parameter groups @xmath79 which admit euclidean realizations in this context as those for which there exists an anti - unitary involution @xmath2 commuting with @xmath3 ( theorem  [ thm : realize ] ) . any such pair @xmath80 with @xmath66 can be encoded in the pair @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is positive selfadjoint with @xmath83 , a relation well - known from tomita - takesaki theory .",
    "such pairs are closely linked to real standard subspaces , a connection discussed in section  [ sec:4 ] . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we finally explain how all this connects to kms states for @xmath84-dynamical systems @xmath85 and conclude with a short discussion of perspectives . to establish the connection with kms states , we need the concept of a positive definite function on a group @xmath22 with values in the space @xmath86 of sesquilinear forms on a real or complex vector space @xmath40 .",
    "this concept is briefly developed in [ sec : a ] , where we explain in particular how the gns construction works in this context .",
    "[ sec : b ] provides some tools to obtain integral representations of positive definite functions on convex sets which sharpen some known results in this context .",
