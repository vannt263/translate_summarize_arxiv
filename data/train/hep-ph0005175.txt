    "<S> a relativistic coulomb - like resummation factor in qcd is suggested , based on the solution of the quasipotential equation .    in describing a charged particle - antiparticle system near threshold , </S>",
    "<S> it is well known from qed that the so - called coulomb resummation factor plays an important role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this resummation , performed on the basis of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential @xmath0 , leads to the sommerfeld - sakharov factor  @xcite @xmath1 which is related to the wave function of the continuous spectrum at the origin , @xmath2 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the velocity of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> an expansion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ss - factor ] ) in a power series in the coupling constant @xmath4 reproduces the threshold singularities of the feynman diagrams in the form @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the threshold region one can not truncate the perturbative series and the @xmath6-factor should be taken into account in its entirety . </S>",
    "<S> a description of quark - antiquark systems near threshold , which has now been intensively investigated @xcite , also requires this coulomb resummation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-factor appears in the parametrization of the imaginary part of the quark current correlator , the drell ratio @xmath7 , which can be approximated in terms of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude of two charged particles @xmath8 at @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonrelativistic replacement of this amplitude by the wave function which obeys the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential , leads to the approximation  ( [ ss - factor ] ) with @xmath10 , for qcd .    in the relativistic theory , especially for systems composed of quarks lighter than the top , the nonrelativistic approximation needs to be modified . to use the @xmath6-factor within </S>",
    "<S> such a relativistic regime one usually uses the simple substitution @xmath11 with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding relativistic generalization of the @xmath6-factor is obviously not unique , for there are numerous ways of expressing the nonrelativistic velocity in terms of the relativistic energy @xmath13 . for a systematic relativistic analysis of quark - antiquark systems , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential from the very beginning to have a relativistic generalization of the @xmath6-factor .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a new form for this relativistic factor in the case of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the quasipotential ( qp ) approach proposed by logunov and tavkhelidze @xcite , in the form suggested by kadyshevsky  @xcite . to find an explicit form for the relativistic @xmath6-factor we will transform the qp equation from momentum space into relativistic configuration space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the local coulomb potential defined in this representation has a qcd - like behavior in momentum space  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of using the qp approach to define the relativistic @xmath6-factor is based on the fact that the bs amplitude , which parameterizes the physical quantity @xmath7 , is taken at @xmath9 , therefore , in particular , at relative time @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the qp wave function is defined as the bs amplitude at @xmath14 , and the @xmath15-ratio can be expressed through the qp wave function @xmath16 by using the relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 $ ] is the relativistic three - dimensional volume element in the lobachevsky space realized on the hyperboloid @xmath19 . and use the system of units @xmath20 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the qp equation in momentum space has the form @xmath21 the proper lorentz transformation , @xmath22 , means a translation in the lobachevsky space @xmath23\\ , .\\ ] ] the role of the plane waves corresponding to the translations ( [ translation ] ) is played by the following functions @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions correspond to the principal series of unitary representations of the lorentz group and in the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonality and completeness relations for these functions are @xmath30 where the relativistic momentum - space @xmath31-function is @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the qp wave functions in the momentum and relativistic configuration representations are related as follows : @xmath33    for a spherically symmetric potential the @xmath34-transform of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ op - m - eq ] ) is the equation @xmath35 where the right hand side is local . here </S>",
    "<S> the transform of the potential is given in terms of the same relativistic plane wave , @xmath36 the left hand side of this equation can be rewritten in a non - integral form by using the operator of the free hamiltonian @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular part of the laplacian operator . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath39 allows one to re - express the equation in terms of finite differences @xmath40 this equation for the coulomb potential has been investigated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions contain arbitrary functions of @xmath41 with period @xmath42 , the so - called the @xmath42-periodic constants , which appear in the solutions due to the finite difference nature of the hamiltonian ( [ h-0 ] ) . for some problems , such as defining the bound state spectrum , this @xmath42-periodic constant is not important . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of extracting the @xmath6-factor , we must develop a method which avoids this ambiguity .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the coulomb potential defined in relativistic configuration space @xmath43 the @xmath34-transformation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ coulomb ] ) gives in momentum space the following function @xmath44 where the relative rapidity @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 and is defined in terms of the square of the momentum transfer by @xmath47 . for large </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 the potential @xmath49 behaves as @xmath50 , which reproduces the principal behavior of the qcd potential proportional to @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the qcd running coupling .    according to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bs - qp ] ) , ( [ xi - funct ] ) , and ( [ p - r - funct ] ) , we find a relation between the required bs amplitude and the qp wave function , @xmath53 . performing a partial - wave analysis we further observe that the qp wave function for an @xmath54-state will contain the generalized power @xmath55 , which vanishes at @xmath56 for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need only to consider the @xmath58 wave function for which we can write @xmath59 . introducing the function @xmath60 into eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ r - eq2 ] ) with the coulomb potential ( [ coulomb ] ) in the form @xmath62 where the @xmath63-integration is performed in the complex plane over a contour with endpoints @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> substituting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ form - of - solut ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r - eq2 ] ) we find the equation - integration with a regularization factor @xmath65 and then set @xmath66 after all calculations . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 which , when we integrate by parts , yields the two equations @xmath68 and @xmath69\\ ,   = \\,-\\,\\alpha\\,r ( \\zeta ) \\,.\\ ] ] the solution of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the branch points of the function ( [ r - zeta ] ) are @xmath75 ( see fig .  [ zeta - plane ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contour of integration must not intersect cuts which we take from @xmath76 to @xmath77 . in the case when the interaction vanishes , @xmath78 , the solution @xmath79 should reproduce the known free wave function @xmath80 . taking into account these remarks and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nonintegral - term ] ) for the boundary values at @xmath64 , we take @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 . the vertical part of the contour to the right is given by @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also convenient for finding a connection to an integral representation of the hypergeometric function to take the horizontal parts of the contour to be characterized by @xmath85 ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ r(r)1 ] ) at @xmath87 with the free wave function we can determine the constant @xmath73 and calculate @xmath88 which leads to the relativistic @xmath6-factor : @xmath89}\\ , , \\quad\\quad x(\\chi)\\,=\\ , \\frac{\\pi\\,\\alpha}{\\sinh\\chi}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the rapidity which related to @xmath90 by @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath92 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s - factor - relativistic ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath93 as @xmath94 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that this new relativistic factor could have a significant impact in interpreting strong - interaction physics . in many physically interesting cases </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 occurs as a factor in an integrand , as , for example , for the case of inclusive @xmath95 decay , for smearing quantities , and for the adler @xmath96 function . here </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath6 at intermediate values of @xmath93 becomes important . to illustrate the difference between the factors  ( [ ss - factor ] ) and ( [ s - factor - relativistic ] ) , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we plot the principal contribution to @xmath7 for the vector currents , @xmath97 for the nonrelativistic case with @xmath11 and the relativistic one , for @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this letter by discussing the two limiting cases . in the nonrelativistic limit , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath99 , the relativistic @xmath6-factor ( [ s - factor - relativistic ] ) reproduces the nonrelativistic result ( [ ss - factor ] ) . in the ultrarelativistic limit , as it has been argued in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the bound state spectrum vanishes as @xmath100 because the particle mass is the only dimensional parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this feature reflects an essential difference between potential models and quantum field theory , where an additional dimensional parameter appears . </S>",
    "<S> one can conclude that within a potential model , the @xmath6-factor which corresponds to the continuous spectrum should go to unity in the limit @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the relativistic resummation factor @xmath6 obtained here reproduces both the expected nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits and corresponds to a qcd - like coulomb potential . </S>"
