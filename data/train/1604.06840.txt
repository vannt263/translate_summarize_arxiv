    "grbs , very energetic events with typical isotropic prompt emission energies , @xmath6 ( erg ) , in the @xmath7 range , have been detected out to redshifts , z , of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this last feature raises the tantalizing possibility of extending direct cosmological studies far beyond the redshift range covered by sne .",
    "however , grbs are not standard candles in any trivial way .",
    "indeed , the number of sub - classes into which they are grouped has grown .",
    "grbs are classified depending on their duration into short ( @xmath9 s ) and long ( @xmath10 s ) is the time interval over which between @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the total prompt energy is emitted . ]",
    "later , a class of grbs with mixed properties , such as short grbs with extended emission ( shortee ) , was discovered @xcite .",
    "long grbs , depending on their * fluence ( erg @xmath13 ) * , can be divided into normal grbs or x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , * the latter are empirically defined as grbs with a greater fluence in the x - ray band ( @xmath14 kev ) than in the @xmath15-ray band ( @xmath16 kev)*. in addition , several grbs also present associated sne , hereafter grb - sne . regarding instead lightcurve morphology , a complex trend in the afterglow has been observed with the swift satellite @xcite showing a flat part , the plateau , soon after the steep decay of the prompt emission . along with these categories",
    "several physical mechanisms for producing grbs have also been proposed .",
    "for example , the plateau emission has been mainly ascribed to millisecond newborn spinning neutron stars , e.g. zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) , troja et al .",

    "the correlations thus far discovered suffer from having large scatters @xcite , beyond observational uncertainties , highlighting that the events studied * probably * come from different classes of systems * or perhaps from the same class of objects , but we do not yet observe a sufficiently large number of parameters to characterize the scatter . *",
    "as the categories of grbs have grown over the years , many with observed x - ray afterglows and measured redshift , the possibility of isolating single classes has appeared .",
    "this allows to derive tighter correlations , thus increasing the accuracy with which cosmological parameters can be inferred ( e.g cardone et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) , dainotti et al .",
    "2013b , postnikov et al . 2014 ) , and yielding more stringent constraints on physical models describing them .",
    "one of the first attempts to standardize grbs in the afterglow parameters was presented in dainotti et al .",
    "( 2008,2010 ) where an approximately inversely proportional correlation between the rest frame end time of the plateau phase , @xmath17 ( in previous papers @xmath18 ) , and its corresponding luminosity @xmath1 was discovered .",
    "dainotti et al .",
    "( 2013a ) proved through the robust statistical efron & petrosian ( 1992 ) method , hereafter ep , that this correlation is intrinsic , and not an artefact of selection effects or due to instrumental threshold truncation , as it is also the case for the @xmath19 correlation , ( dainotti et al .",
    "2011b,2015b ) , where @xmath2 is the peak luminosity in the prompt emission .    in this letter",
    "we show how a careful discrimination of plateau phase grbs can be performed to isolate , using x - ray afterglow light curve morphology , a sub class of events which define a very tight plane in a three dimensional space of @xmath20 .",
    "a three parameter correlation emerges with an intrinsic scatter , @xmath21 , of @xmath22 less than the @xmath23 correlation for the sample of 122 long grbs .",
    "when we choose a subsample of high quality data ( 40 grbs , hereafter the gold sample ) , a further @xmath24 reduction in @xmath21 appears .",
    "* we also show through bootstrapping that the reduction in scatter is not an artefact of observational biases .",
    "actually , dainotti et al .",
    "( 2010,2011a ) have already demonstrated through a careful data analysis and monte carlo simulations that to reduce the scatter of this correlation an appropriate selection criterion related to observational grb properties is more important than simply increasing sample size . *",
    "the @xmath21 of the @xmath25 correlation for the gold sample is @xmath26 smaller than the scatter of the @xmath23 correlation for the sample of 122 long grbs .",
    "a slightly more scattered @xmath27 correlation is also present , which together with an almost constant total energy within the plateau phase for the gold sample is indicative of a strong energy coupling between prompt emission and x - ray afterglow phase . in section  [ sample selection ] and  [ 3d correlation ] we describe the _ swift _ data sample used and the three parameter correlation respectively . in section  [ discussion ] we present the @xmath28 correlation as the tightest currently available involving the afterglow phase , together with our concluding remarks .",

    "( 2010 ) requiring an * observationally homogeneous sample in terms of @xmath53 and spectral lag properties * implies removing short grbs ( @xmath9 s ) and shortee from the analysis .",

    "since there are long grbs for which no sne has not been detected , for example the nearby @xmath57 sne - less grb 060505 , the existence of a new group of long grbs without supernova has been suggested , thus highlighting the possibility of two types of long - grbs , with and without sne . * therefore , in the interest of selecting an * observational * homogeneous class of objects , we consider only the long grbs with no associated sne .",

    "* figure 1 shows the light curve for grb 061121 with the best fit model light curve superimposed . the plateau phase is clearly seen between @xmath58 and @xmath59 in @xmath60 in units of seconds ( s ) .    ,",

    "( 2010 ) when the @xmath66 , the pl fit is preferred .",
    "we additionally discard @xmath67 grbs which were better fitted with a black body model than with a pl .",
    "this full set of criteria reduces the sample to @xmath68 long grbs .",
    "finally , we construct a sub sample by including strict data quality and morphology criteria : at least @xmath69 points should be at the beginning of the plateau and * the steep plateaus ( the angle of the plateau greater than @xmath70 degrees ) , which constitute the @xmath71 of the total sample and are the high angle tail of the distribution , are removed*. * the first of the above selection criteria guarantees that the lightcurves clearly present the transition from the steep decay after the prompt to the plateau .",
    "the number of points required for the w07 fit should be at least @xmath72 , since there are @xmath72 free parameters in the model , one of which should be after the end of the plateau .",
    "thus , the requirement of @xmath67 points in total ( @xmath69 at the start and at least one after the plateau ) ensures a minimum number of points to have both a clear transition to the plateau phase ( in fact , in some cases @xmath73 points do not offer a wide enough time range to determine the start of the plateau ) and simultaneously to constrain the plateau .",
    "* this data quality cut defines the gold sample , which includes @xmath74 grbs .",
    "we have also checked through the t - test that this gold sample is not statistically different from the distribution of ( @xmath39 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath44 ) of the full sample , thus showing that the choice of this sample does not introduce any biases , such as the malmquist or eddington ones , against high luminosity and/or high redshift grbs .",
    "* specifically , @xmath39,@xmath0,@xmath2 and @xmath44 of the gold sample present similar gaussian distributions , but with smaller tails than the total sample ( see dainotti et al .",
    "2015a ) , thus there is no shift of the distribution towards high luminosities , larger times or high redshift .",
    "so , the selection cut naturally removes the majority of the high error outliers of the variables involved , thus reducing the scatter of the correlation for the gold sample . *",

    "we see a clear monotonic trend , in that the intercept of the lines is determined by the @xmath2 bin of the sub - sample , all of which show a significantly smaller dispersion than the 122 grb sample . * the above is indicative of an underlying plane in the @xmath81 parameter space , the @xmath4 correlation being just a projection of it . introducing a third ( prompt emission )",

    "this normalization of the plane allows the resulting parameter set , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath21 and @xmath86 to be uncorrelated and provides explicit error propagation .",
