    "the recent prediction @xcite of the existence of three - dimensional topological insulators ( ti ) and their experimental confirmation in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and related compounds @xcite have generated a lot of excitement , as these ti form a new class of material which is distinct from ordinary band insulators , metals etc , possessing peculiar properties such as topologically protected surface states and usual electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "these properties arises from spin - orbit coupling , leading to band - inversions at some regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "interestingly , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , when doped with copper , is found to become superconducting @xcite.@xcite some unusual properties , such as existence of zero bias conductance peak in tunneling experiments @xcite and absence of pauli limiting in upper critical field @xcite , seem to suggest unconventional character of the cooper pairing , though the situation is not without controversy @xcite .",
    "there is a lot of attention to the theoretical aspects of superconductivity in this compound , in particular possible odd parity pairing states .",
    "early on , fu and berg @xcite , starting from an effective hamiltonian for the normal state of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 near the zero momentum @xmath5 point with two orbitals per unit cell , considered various models of superconducting states with momentum - independent pairs when expressed in terms of this basis .",
    "properties of these models have subsequently analyzed by many , mostly focusing on the surface states @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , superconductivity in systems with strong spin - orbit coupling have been much studied in the past , in particular in the context of heavy fermions @xcite . there , the usual language used is that the normal quasiparticles are described by a pseudospin basis , obeying certain symmetry properties , and then the superconducting state order parameter and pair wavefunctions are expressed in terms of this basis .",
    "the superconducting states then can be classified by crystal symmetries into group representations , and the pairing states are expressed in terms the sets of basis functions appropriate to the relevant group representations . in this formulation , for crystals with inversion symmetry , even parity superconductors always have pairing wavefunctions even in momentum @xmath3 and are singlets in pseudospins , whereas odd parity superconductors have pairing wavefunctions that matrices in pseudopsin space with each opponent odd in @xmath3 .",
    "this matrix structure is usually expressed in terms of a `` d - vector '' which specifies the corresponding pseudospin structure via familiar pauli @xmath6 matrices .",
    "properties of the superconductors can then be directly obtained by examining these order parameters , including the possibility of surface states .",
    "many questions then arise .",
    "if the chemical potential @xmath7 , of the doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is sufficiently large compared with the pairing potential @xmath8 , ( which is likely to be the case since @xmath9 according to @xcite , whereas the transition temperature is @xmath10k .",
    "the measured gap in tunneling is indeed @xmath11 , though the precise value is controversial @xcite ) , pairing should effectively only take place within one normal state band .",
    "how well then can we understand the superconducting properties of cu : bi@xmath0be@xmath1 within a single band picture ?",
    "what is the pairing order parameter in the pseudospin basis ?",
    "can we understand the andreev bound states in this way ?",
    "in particular , what is the origin of the very peculiar dispersions found for the odd parity states found in @xcite ?    in this paper , we report such an attempt . in sec [ sec : back ] , we review the model of @xcite .",
    "pseudospin wavefunctions are constructed in sec [ sec : wf ] .",
    "they would be applied to the superconducting phases , first for the bulk in [ sec : bulk ] , then the surface states in [ sec : surface ] .",
    "we shall show that many of the results in the literature can be understood in this way .",
    "we conclude in [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the appendix gives further discussions on the surface states and topology of some of the superconducting phases .",
    "in this section , we review the model of @xcite . we begin with the normal state .",
    "the effective hamiltonian which captures the physics near @xmath12 is given by h_n ( k ) = m _ x + v_z k_z _ y + v _ z ( k_x s_y - k_y s_x ) [ hn ] here @xmath3 , @xmath13 represent the wavevector and its components , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are velocities , @xmath16 represents the two ( mainly ) @xmath17 orbitals in the quintuple layer of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , and @xmath18 are the pauli matrices for the spin .",
    "equation ( [ hn ] ) is basically a dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the energies for the quasiparticles are @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 , thus consist of a conduction and a valence band .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 possesses @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) symmetry , which includes parity .",
    "eq ( [ hn ] ) is indeed invariant under the parity when this operator is taken as @xmath24 @xcite : eq ( [ hn ] ) is left unmodified if we substitute @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with all other variables unaltered .",
    "equation ( [ hn ] ) is actually invariant under the higher symmetry group @xmath27 as it is obviously unchanged under any continuous rotation about the @xmath28-axis instead of only @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "one can check easily that ( [ hn ] ) is invariant under reflection about any vertical reflection planes .",
    "since it is rotationally symmetric about @xmath28 , it is sufficient to check any one single vertical reflection plane . for example , under reflection in the x - z plane , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , ( [ hn ] ) remains indeed unchanged .",
    "@xcite    to discuss the surface states associated with the ti , boundary conditions for the wavefunction are needed .",
    "unfortunately , this point seems to be somewhat controversial @xcite .",
    "for definiteness , we follow @xcite here . the boundary condition for the wavefunction @xmath33 at the @xmath34 plane for a crystal occupying @xmath35",
    "is taken to be @xmath36 , and hence it has no projection in the @xmath37 orbital .",
    "topological surface states in the form of a dirac cone exist when @xmath38.@xcite for spin along @xmath39 , the bound state energy is @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the positive energy branch has spin along @xmath41 . to account for the situation of be@xmath0si@xmath1 ,",
    "@xcite we need to take @xmath42 , though we shall consider arbitrary relative signs of @xmath15 , @xmath43 and @xmath14 below for comparison purposes .",
    "since the bulk energies are given by @xmath44 , and so within this model , the surface states are always separated from the continuum for any given @xmath45 .",
    "now we consider the superconducting states , first for the bulk . for time - reversal and inversion symmetric systems ,",
    "there is a pair of degenerate states at any given momentum @xmath3 , forming a pseudospin @xmath46 .",
    "cooper pairing occurs between opposite momenta @xmath3 and @xmath47 , and can be classified into even parity , pseudospin singlet and odd parity , pseudospin triplet states.@xcite these superconducting states can further be classified by their different symmetries under the crystal symmetries into different representations in group theory.@xcite these representations depend only on the point group ( but not the space group ) .",
    "possible forms of the corresponding momentum and pseudospin dependence in each group representation expressed in the form of basis functions : the general form of the order parameter can be a linear combination of the independent basis functions of the same symmetry , each term possibly multiplied by a momentum dependent function which is invariant under the particular group under consideration .",
    "they have in particular been listed for the cubic @xmath48 , tetragonal @xmath49 , and hexagonal @xmath50 groups @xcite .",
    "for @xmath50 we have the group representations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with each of the above either even ( @xmath57 ) or odd ( @xmath58 ) parity . the corresponding table for @xmath30 appropriate for bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    "was not listed in these references , but can be trivially obtained from those for @xmath50 since @xmath50 would reduce to @xmath30 if we discard rotations about @xmath59 of odd multiples of @xmath60 and three of the horizontal rotational axes . in this case , @xmath51 is no longer distinguishable from @xmath52 , and similarly for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting group representations and their basis function are listed in the first two columns of table [ table ] , following ref @xcite . for simplicity , we do not list all the possible independent basis functions , but mainly those which would appear again in the later part of this paper . for the complete basis function",
    "set , we refer the readers to the literature @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , various types of momentum independent ( local ) pairing in the orbital and spin basis of eq ( [ hn ] ) were considered . since",
    "this formulation involves states of eq ( [ hn ] ) without _ a priori _ distinguishing the conduction and valence band , we shall refer to this as the `` full two - band description '' @xcite the symmetry of these states were already discussed in @xcite , and we list each these states with their corresponding symmetries in column ( iii ) of table [ table ] . in this table , we have followed the notation of @xcite and use @xmath61 to label the two orbitals instead of @xmath62 of eq ( [ hn ] ) . for convenience of comparison with other works in the literature",
    "@xcite , we also list in columns ( iv ) and ( v ) these order parameters in matrix form , which we shall denote @xmath63 and @xmath64 and referred to as `` nambu i '' and `` nambu ii '' .",
    "@xmath65 is the matrix order parameter in the ordinary nambu notation after generalization to two orbitals , that is , if we use the operators as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 s are annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath69 the two orbitals .",
    "if we use instead @xmath70 , as done in @xcite , ( or @xmath71 , as in @xcite ) the order parameter matrix is @xmath64 .",
    "the two notations are related simply by @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the factorizing out of @xmath74 to the right has the effect of what has been done in the @xmath75he literature @xcite , where the order parameter matrix is written as @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 transforms as a vector under spin - rotations . in this way , it is clear from column ( v ) that the two entries listed under @xmath78 are related by a @xmath79 rotations about the @xmath28-axis . in making this table ,",
    "we have made use of the gauge symmetry of superconductivity to simplify the matrices ( by removing factors like @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) .",
    "however , we have kept the correct relative phase between the two partners within @xmath82 , so that they have the correct relative transformation properties .",

    "however , it does not tell us directly what exactly the momentum dependences are , since multiplication of any basis function by a function invariant under the crystal symmetry is also an as good basis function .",
    "it also does not tell us , in particular for the case of odd - parity pairing , what linear combinations between the different inequivalent basis functions ( e.g. @xmath94 and @xmath93 for @xmath92 ) that we should take .",
    "we shall see later that this information is in fact useful for understanding the surface state spectrum .",
    "to do this , we have to first construct the single particle pseudospin wavefunctions obeying the correct crystal symmetries , as we shall do in section [ sec : wf ] .",
    "we shall then take up the task of showing how the pairings listed in column ( iii ) correspond to the basis functions listed in column ( ii ) in sec [ sec : bulk ] .",
    "now we construct the pseudospin wavefunctions . for each @xmath3",

    "we shall thus first find an intermediate basis @xmath122 and @xmath123 obeying equations ( [ p ] ) and ( [ t ] ) without worrying about the rotational properties .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us first introduce spin wavefunctions which diagonalize the spin part of eq ( [ hn ] ) , using |s = z k > = ( 1 + i e^i _ k ) |s = -z k > = ( i e^-i _ k + 1 ) for spins along @xmath124 . here @xmath125 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath3 in the @xmath126 plane .",

    "it is then straight - forward to diagonalize eq ( [ hn ] ) .",

    "we here simply note that , if a general @xmath83 is considered , the pure @xmath195 state and the pure @xmath194 state are connected in the sense that one can find a path in parameter space which connects them with the state remaining fully gapped ( see sec [ sec : bulk ] ) .",
    "the @xmath194 phase is topologically trivial , and no surface states are expected .",
    "thus the surface states of @xmath195 are expected to be destroyed in general once a finite @xmath232 is introduced .",
    "this is in accordance with the argument of @xcite where they showed that @xmath232 would introduce a finite matrix element coupling the two surface states of @xmath195 .",
