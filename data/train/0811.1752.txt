    "for the results discussed here we employ two kinds of relativistic constituent - quark models ( rcqms ) .",
    "these are the goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) rcqm  @xcite and a variant of the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) rcqm presented in ref .",
    "they are defined through a relativistically invariant mass operator @xmath0 that is treated in the framework of poincar - invariant quantum mechanics .",
    "the solution of its eigenvalue equation @xmath1 leads to the mass @xmath2 and eigenstate @xmath3 of a baryon ground or resonant state , characterized by intrinsic spin @xmath4 with @xmath5-component @xmath6 ; the @xmath3 are simultaneously eigenstates of the velocity operator @xmath7 and also of the momentum operator @xmath8 .    for our calculations of baryon reactions ,",
    "in particular of the elastic electromagnetic and axial form factors of the nucleons and the mesonic decays of the baryon resonances considered below , we adhere to the point form of poincar - invariant quantum mechanics , since it allows to produce manifestly covariant results .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the generators of lorentz transformations to be independent of interactions ; the only interaction - dependent generators of the poincar group are the four components of the momentum operator @xmath9 .    the mass - operator eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) is solved with the stochastic variational method ( svm )  @xcite , which allows to achieve very accurate mass eigenvalues and also the most general dependence of baryon wave functions on color , flavor , spin , and spatial variables .",
    "more details on the formalism can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the invariant mass spectra of the two types of rcqms are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ndel ] and  [ fig : lasig ] for the baryon states below @xmath10 gev considered here .",
    "some striking features of the spectra are immediately evident . here",
    ", we only hint to the wrong level ordering of the oge rcqm with regard to the @xmath11 roper resonance @xmath12 and the @xmath13 resonance @xmath14 in the @xmath15 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ndel ] ) and the failure of both rcqms in describing the first excitation @xmath16 in the @xmath17 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lasig ] ) .     and @xmath18 states with total angular momentum and parity @xmath19 for the oge ( left levels ) and gbe ( right levels )",
    "rcqms in comparison to experimental values with uncertainties  @xcite , represented as ( green ) shadowed boxes.,height=302 ]     for the lowest @xmath17 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 states .",
    "the dashed lines in the @xmath22 @xmath6 spectrum represent ( decuplet ) eigenstates , for which there is no experimental counterpart yet.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]   for the lowest @xmath17 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 states .",
    "the dashed lines in the @xmath22 @xmath6 spectrum represent ( decuplet ) eigenstates , for which there is no experimental counterpart yet.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]",
    "a first test of the mass - operator eigenstates @xmath3 concerns the elastic electromagnetic from factors of the nucleon . in this context a simplified current operator according to the point - form spectator model ( pfsm ) has been used so far .",
    "it means that the virtual photon couples only to a single constituent quark in the nucleon .",
    "nevertheless the pfsm current represents an effective many - body operator  @xcite .",
    "the covariant predictions of the gbe and oge rcqms for the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton and the neutron are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : proton_comp ] and  [ fig : neutron_comp ] . for momentum transfers up to @xmath23 gev@xmath24 , where we may assume a quark - model description to be reasonable ,",
    "the results of both the gbe and oge rcqms are found in surprisingly good agreement with the available experimental data . a nonrelativistic calculation along",
    "the usual impulse approximation fails completely  @xcite .",
    "similarly a relativistic calculation performed along an instant - form spectator model , constructed in anology to the pfsm , is found to be far off the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "while the detailed behaviour of the nucleon wave function is of lesser influence , the correct treatment of relativistic effects appears to be most essential .",
    "this observation is further supported by the comparison with the relativistic results for the nucleon form factors obtained by the bonn group with their instanton - induced ( ii ) rcqm  @xcite in a completely different bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite ( also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : proton_comp ] and  [ fig : neutron_comp ] ) . on the other hand , a simplistic nucleon wave function , such as",
    "the one obtained with a confinement potential only , is also not adequate . since it misses important mixed - symmetric spatial components , it yields an almost zero result in particular for the neutron electric form factor ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : neutron_comp ] ) .",
    "a corresponding behaviour is found for the nucleon electromagnetic radii and magnetic moments : the direct pfsm predictions of the rcqms are very close to the experimental data both for the proton and the neutron  @xcite .",
    "even for these observables , which relate to momentum transfers @xmath25 , relativistic effects are high importance , and a nonrelativistic theory is by no means adequate .",
    "quite similar results are obtained for electric radii and magnetic moments also of the other baryon ground states , where a comparison to experiment is possible  @xcite .      with regard to the nucleon axial and induced pseudoscalar form factors , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the situation is quite similar to the elastic electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "only the covariant predictions of the rcqms come close to the experimental data . again",
    "the pfsm results and the ones obtained in the bethe - salpeter approach are alike  @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic impulse approximation is not acceptable . in case of the induced pseudoscalar form factor @xmath27",
    "the inclusion of the pion pole term is crucial .",
    "it can naturally be implemented for the gbe rcqm , in line with the dynamics in its hyperfine interaction ( pseudoscalar boson exchange ) .",
    "recently , the relativistic study of all single - meson decay modes of the light and strange resonances below @xmath10 gev has been completed in the approach adopting a pfsm decay operator  @xcite .",
    "the covariant results for the partial @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 decay widths show a typical behaviour in the sense that they usually underestimate the experimental data .",
    "the situation is exemplified for octet baryon resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_graph_oge_gbe_oct ] .",
    "similar patterns are obtained for the decuplet and singlet resonances  @xcite .",
    "the systematics found in the decay widths together with a detailed analysis of the spin - flavor contents and spatial structures of the baryon wave functions allow for a new and extended classification of the ground and resonant states into flavor multiplets  @xcite .",
    "the members of the flavor octets , decuplets , and singlets following from our relativistic study are summarized in tables  [ tab : multiplet_oct ] to  [ tab : multiplet_singl ] . in some instances",
    "we find assignments different from the ones quoted by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "a few resonances not considered by the pdg reasonably fit into our multiplet classification ( e.g. , in the @xmath6 spectrum ) .",
    "of course , additional experimental evidences would be highly welcome , and are in fact necessary , to confirm the assignments of certain states .",
    "for a thorough discussion of the detailed properties of the members in each one of the multiplets , especially also with regard to spatial probability density distributions in terms of jacobi coordinates between the constituent quarks , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "at present , rcqms allow for a unified description of the light and strange baryon spectra in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "this is especially true for the gbe rcqm , which produces the right level orderings both in the @xmath15 and @xmath17 spectra , due to its flavor - dependent hyperfine interaction .",
    "the description of the @xmath16 , however , remains as a notorious problem .",
    "the electroweak structure of the nucleons and other baryon ground states is well described by covariant results following from the point - form approach ; they are very similar to the predictions by the ii rcqm in the framework of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the strong decays can not be explained by the pfsm results .",
    "obviously considerable refinements are necessary in the decay operator and/or resonance wave functions .",
    "still , the consistent pattern found in the results for the partial decay widths , in combination with an analysis of the spin - flavor contents and spatial structures of the baryon wave functions , gives useful hints for the classification of resonances into @xmath31 flavor multiplets .",
    "this work was partially supported by the austrian science fund ( fwf - project p19035 ) .",
