    "the formation of structure in the universe , from the largest scales ( _ e.g. _ , `` great walls '' ) to the smallest scales ( _ e.g. _ , galaxies and globular clusters ) , remains a very controversial topic in modern observational cosmology .",
    "standard inflationary cosmologies predict that the primordial density field is a gaussian random field which can lead to either `` top - down '' or `` bottom - up '' structure formation , depending on whether very small or very large structures formed first .",
    "this in turn depends upon whether the gravitationally dominant dark matter is cold ( cdm ) , hot ( hdm ) , or some mixture thereof ( chdm , mdm ) .",
    "traditionally , it has been assumed that a dominant dissipationless component of dark matter accumulates through gravitational instability into clumps , the virialized parts of which become dark matter halos .",
    "galaxies then form by the cooling and condensation of gas within these halos ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "the inability to detect the intense lyman-@xmath0 emission expected from large numbers of such young forming galaxies with strong continuous star formation at high redshift in narrow - band imaging surveys ( thompson , mannucci , & beckwith 1996 ; thompson , djorgovski , & trauger 1995 ) is instead more consistent with a hierarchical formation scenario , in which galaxies were assembled from pieces over a long interval .",
    "it is also possible that high - redshift galaxies , or more specifically , their lyman-@xmath0 light is obscured by dust or destroyed by resonant scattering , even in the absence of dust .",
    "still , hierarchical clustering ( a `` bottom - up '' scenario ) currently appears to be the most successful at reproducing many of the properties of the real universe , as noted by diaferio & geller ( 1997 ) , while remaining within the constraints produced by the cobe results . in the typical ( cdm ) hierarchical clustering model , structure grows from the gravitational collapse of small initial density perturbations , from which systems of progressively larger mass merge and collapse to form newly virialized systems .",
    "most modern hierarchical models are variations of the original press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory of structure formation , in which isothermal `` seeds '' existing at recombination grew into the galaxies we see today .",
    "pascarelle ( 1996b , hereafter p96b ) presented evidence for a gravitationally bound collection of sub - galactic star - forming objects at , which fits well with expectations from hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "these objects appear to have effective radii ( or half - light radii ) of @xmath201 , or 1 kpc ( assuming @xmath3=100 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5=0.5 throughout , unless otherwise noted ) .",
    "since this is much smaller than the median  field galaxy scale length of @xmath603 ( odewahn 1996 ) , and at any redshift in the range @xmath7 , 0102 corresponds to only 0.52 kpc , the  candidates appear to be smaller than the size of a present - day galaxy ( _ i.e. _ , sub - galactic ) .",
    "p96b suggested that these proposed `` galaxy building blocks '' are actually part of a widespread population existing throughout the redshift range @xmath8 .",
    "we undertook a cycle 6  project to image four random fields using the same filters as p96b ( since wfpc2 conveniently has a medium - band filter to sample lyman-@xmath0 at ) in an effort to test the universality of these objects at .",
    "it is clear that galaxies at all redshifts are more inclined to be in groups or clusters than isolated , giving the term `` field galaxy '' less meaning than it once had . as such , it is perhaps not surprising to find that in many `` pencil - beam '' galaxy redshift surveys , often several galaxies are found in a single narrow redshift bin ( _ e.g. _ , the hubble deep field ( hdf ) counts reported in cohen 1996 and the large structure of galaxies found at @xmath9 by steidel 1998 ) . on a slightly larger angular scale ,",
    "`` spikes '' have been found in the redshift distribution of several more extensive galaxy surveys out to @xmath101 ( broadhurst 1990 ; landy 1996 ; ettori , guzzo & tarenghi 1997 ) , indicative of some sort of larger structure at earlier epochs .",
    "what is questionable , according to cdm models , is whether or not any such structure could have existed at high redshifts .",
    "rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz ( 1997 , hereafter rhs97 ) are able to reproduce the observational characteristics of qso absorption systems at @xmath11 over a wide range of column densities with a model consisting of sub - galactic clumps embedded in sheet - like structures and often lying along filaments .",
    "the similarities between the grouping of  sub - galactic clumps of p96b ( see their fig",
    ". 1 ) and the rhs97 simulations are quite striking ( see fig .",
    "1_a _ of rhs97 , which shows not only a field about the same size as our 53w002  field , but also with about the same number of clumps at a similarly high redshift ) .",
    "their simulations indicate that @xmath1220 compact clumps will merge to produce about three @xmath13 galaxies by @xmath10=0 .",
    "this agrees quite well with the calculations carried out in p96b , which suggest that 17 candidate subgalactic clumps could form several @xmath13 galaxies by @xmath10=0 .",
    "is it possible that groups , clusters , or even larger - scale structure existed to some extent at earlier epochs , although at much lower amplitude than that seen at lower redshifts ?",
    "if the answer is yes , then it should not be surprising to find the compact , star - forming protogalactic objects arranged in groups , clusters , or even filaments or `` sheets . ''",
    "the cycle 6 data presented here represent an initial attempt to begin to answer this question .    in  2 , we describe the observations and data processing , in  3 we present the results , and in  4 we discuss some of the implications of these results in the context of galaxy and structure formation at high redshift .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "has the ability to image a field with  in parallel with other instruments .",
    "this ( usually ) random field can be 414  away from the primary target , depending on the primary instrument being used .",
    "we received three long parallel observations with  using the f410 m , f450w , and f814w filters in cycle 6 .",
    "the medium - band f410 m filter is centered at 4090  with a full - width - at - half - maximum of 150 , so that lyman-@xmath0 emission from objects in the range @xmath14 can be detected .",
    "we received 68 parallel orbits per field , divided where possible into more than one exposure to allow proper cosmic ray removal ( see windhorst 1994b ) .",
    "the details of the observations , including the dates , coordinates , position angle of the v3 axis , and total exposure times in each filter are given in table 1 .",
    "cccccccc date & @xmath0 & @xmath15 & pa of v3 & t@xmath16(f410 m ) & t@xmath17(f450w ) & t@xmath16(f814w ) + 30 aug 1996 & 21@xmath18 7@xmath19 318 & 522331 & 2750 & 9600s & 2900s & 700s + 11 jan 1997 & 16@xmath18 36@xmath19 383 & + 8234136 & 1273 & 11900s & 3200s & 900s + 20 may 1997 & 10@xmath18 24@xmath19 381 & + 474396 & 2900 & 14900s & 5600s & 3000s +    the images were processed by the usual  pipeline , and aligned to the nearest integer pixel in iraf . for accurate photometry of compact objects that are expected to have sizes of only a few  pixels or less , it is imperative to do reliable cosmic ray rejection . because of this",
    ", the averaging and cosmic ray rejection were done with a custom - written code created to deal specifically with a small number ( @xmath20 ) of low - signal images .",
    "this routine , written in the interactive data language ( idl ) , first scales the input images by their respective exposure times .",
    "any remaining differences left in the global sky values are from time - dependent variations in the sky background .",
    "these variations are likely due to the proximity of any particular image pointing to the earth s limb , which changes during each orbit , so that the sky differences are additive .",
    "the program calculates rough sky values from the global image modes , and applies zeropoint offsets ( by subtracting a constant ) to bring all the sky values to the lowest sky in the normalized set .",
    "the image mode is calculated by fitting a polynomial to the histogram of pixel values and finding the maximum of the curve ( _ i.e. _ , the mode ) . because the cosmic ray rejection code assumes all pixels values within a few sigma of sky are `` good",
    ", '' it is important to remove all bad negative pixels first .",
    "therefore , all negative pixels more than 3.5@xmath21 below the median of the eight surrounding pixels are replaced by that median .",
    "the main loop to remove cosmic rays works by `` stacking '' the aligned images on top of each other and then working on each individual `` stack '' of pixels ( or array of pixels in the @xmath10-dimension ) , after each pixel stack is sorted by value in ascending order .",
    "the two pixels with the lowest values are compared to see if they are @xmath222.5@xmath23 apart , where @xmath21 is the standard deviation using the lowest pixel value .",
    "if so , then they are averaged , and the next highest value pixel is compared to this average , and so on for the entire pixel stack . if a pixel has a value @xmath242.5@xmath23 from this running average , then it is rejected as a cosmic ray .",
    "the cutoff value of 2.5@xmath23 comes from windhorst , franklin , & neuschaefer ( 1994b ) , who determined this as the optimal level at which to reject cosmic rays from multi - orbit _ wf / pc _ images . the standard deviation ( @xmath21 ) of the running average",
    "is recalculated at each step for each pixel stack using the ccd equation : @xmath25 in which s = the intensity ( in adu ) of that pixel , g = the ccd gain ( in electrons / data number ) , rn = the ccd readnoise ( in electrons ) , d = the ccd dark current ( in electrons / second ) , and t = the exposure time ( in seconds ) .",
    "the values for the gain , readnoise , and dark current were obtained from the  handbook .",
    "photometry was then performed , as detailed in windhorst ( 1991 ) , on the cleaned average images using the cassandra photometry package of d. schneider , which utilizes user - input apertures and sky regions .",
    "the sky region is interpolated underneath the object aperture by fitting a sloped plane to the pixels unaffected by faint neighbors ( see also odewahn 1996 ) .",
    "the photometric zeropoints used are those given in holtzman ( 1995 ) and include the various gain ratios for each chip ( @xmath619.55 for f410 m , @xmath621.92 for f450w , and @xmath621.59 for f814w ) .",
    "a total of 141 objects were detected simultaneously in all three filters in the three fields .",
    "the photometric  curve of growth \" was examined , and apertures were adjusted to give the highest signal - to - noise ratio for each object , while maintaining the _ same size _ aperture in the three filters .",
    "the results of the photometry performed on the three cycle 6  fields are presented in the color - color diagram of figure 1 ( the same as that used to identify the  candidates of pascarelle ( 1996a ) and p96b ) . for consistency with the cycle 5 53w002 field data , we interpolated @xmath26 colors from the @xmath27 colors using the effective central wavelengths ( from the  handbook ) of the three filters involved .",
    "this approximation is justified as long as the spectra of these faint blue objects are close to a power law across the three filters ( see windhorst 1991 ; p96b ) and affects only the horizontal axis . as such , this approximation has almost no effect on the nearly horizontal distribution of points and the number of lyman-@xmath0 emitting candidates found .    a featureless power law ( f@xmath28 ) is indicated by the solid line , with asterisks indicating integer values of @xmath0 .",
    "because of the relatively small range of the restframe spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that the hst filters will sample below the 4000  break for objects at high redshift , a power law provides an adequate fit to their seds for various values of @xmath0 . since a large fraction of high - redshift objects",
    "are blue and have relatively uncomplicated seds of blue stars shortward of the 4000break , an @xmath0 of @xmath122 would be appropriate to describe the rayleigh - jeans tail of their seds .",
    "indeed , most of the objects in figure 1 group themselves around a value of @xmath29 on the power - law line .",
    "lower redshift ( older ) stellar populations will appear redder in these passbands , both from their intrinsic sed shapes and from the @xmath30-corrections , and thus have larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "the two dotted lines represent approximate 2-@xmath21 photometric error boundaries and mark the limits of the general  field \" object distribution ( open squares ) . below this field distribution on the plot",
    "lies a group of objects ( filled squares ) which have significant excess emission at 4100 , likely lyman-@xmath0 emission at .",
    "there exists the possibility that a fraction of these candidates could be @xmath31 objects whose [ oii ] emission at 3727  has entered the f410 m filter .",
    "however the differential volume element at  is @xmath12100 times larger than at @xmath31 , and any other emission lines between lyman-@xmath0 and [ oii ] strong enough to be detected , such as or , would only come from objects that have much lower surface densities ( _ e.g. _ , qsos and/or powerful radio galaxies ) .",
    "since no other strong emission lines exist between lyman-@xmath0 and [ oii ] for star - forming objects ( kinney 1996 ) , we therefore expect that at most a few of the candidates may turn out to be emission line galaxies ( or others ) at lower redshift .",
    "approximate lyman-@xmath0 restframe equivalent widths were calculated from the f410 m fluxes and are indicated along the righthand vertical axis of figure 1 . if the excess 4100  emission is interpreted as lyman-@xmath0 emission , it can be seen that most candidates have lyman-@xmath0 equivalent widths more consistent with typical  case b \" recombination ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath22100 ) rather than with the existence of an agn .",
    "the restframe ultraviolet reddening vector ( seaton 1979 ) expected at  is indicated , and suggests that the few reddest candidates may have a visual absorption of @xmath3223 mag .",
    "these reddest candidates should be viewed with some caution , however , because of the slight dependence of the @xmath33 magnitudes on @xmath33@xmath34 color .",
    "this effect increases towards redder color ( holtzman 1995 ) , in the sense that these very red objects appear somewhat lower on the plot than they should , and therefore could be contaminating field objects .",

    "it can be seen in figure 4_b _ that all data sets contain mostly sub - l@xmath41 objects , assuming they are all at . in particular , a majority of the candidates have m@xmath42 to 21.5 mag , despite the different completeness limits imposed by the shallower f410 m exposures ( as indicated by the dotted arrows at the right of figure 2 ) .",

    "no attempt was made to fit point source contributions to any candidates without spectroscopically known agn .",
    "in models of hierarchical galaxy formation , the luminous galaxies we see today were built up through the repeated merging of smaller protogalactic pieces .",
    "a significant number of such sub - galactic clumps may have been found at by p96b in a field surrounding the radio galaxy 53w002 at @xmath10=2.390 .",
    "there has been a recent series of reports of very high redshift , `` normal '' star - forming galaxies with possibly greater scale lengths and higher luminosities ( _ e.g. _ , hu & mcmahon 1996 ; madau 1996 ; steidel 1996a and 1996b ; yee 1996 ; francis , woodgate , & danks 1997 ; lowenthal 1997 ; trager 1997 ) .",
    "the steidel ( 1996a , b ) madau ( 1996 ) , and lowenthal ( 1997 ) galaxies were found through their @xmath44-band or @xmath39-band `` dropout , '' caused by the lyman break in their spectra , and not via emissions lines , which may explain why they may be more luminous than the  clumps of p96b ( _ i.e _ , a significant continuum detection was necessary to find them ) .",
    "in addition , only about 4050% of these `` dropout '' galaxies are lyman-@xmath0 emitters , with the rest having either no lyman-@xmath0 emission or significant lyman-@xmath0 in absorption .",
    "the relatively stronger lyman-@xmath0 emitters like the sub - galactic clumps of p96b and this paper , and those reported by hu & mcmahon ( 1996 ) and francis , woodgate , & danks ( 1997 ) were found likely because they have had fewer generations of o stars , and so fewer supernovae to produce significant dust to destroy the lyman-@xmath0 light .",
    "these findings suggest that galaxies formed over a large range of redshift rather than at one special time , and possibly according to several different formation scenarios .",
    "if a large percentage of galaxies did in fact form hierarchically , we would expect to find their building blocks at high redshifts ( @xmath102 ) , consistent with the large number of star - forming objects currently being found at such high redshifts .",
    "many studies seem to point toward a merger rate that was higher in the past , following @xmath45(1+@xmath10)@xmath46 with @xmath47 ( burkey 1994 ; carlberg , pritchet , & infante 1994 ; yee & ellingson 1995 ; patton 1997 ) and suggests that there should have been a higher space density of sub - galactic clumps at earlier epochs in order to produce the observed local luminosity function . taken together with the fact that most luminous early - type galaxies appear to have been `` in place '' by @xmath48 ( mutz 1994 ; driver 1995a ; lilly 1995 ; odewahn 1996 ; heyl 1997 ; driver 1998 ) , these two points imply that a large fraction of today s luminous ellipticals and early- to mid - type spirals formed at @xmath101 , possibly from the merging of such sub - galactic sized objects .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that disks can be regenerated ( or generated ) after such mergers , as gas remains bound to the system and falls back in ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ; tissera , lambas , & abadi 1997 ) .    as shown in p96b ,",
    "provides the resolution and sensitivity necessary for a search for such populations of faint compact objects .",
    "the fortunate existence of a medium - band  filter centered at 4100(lyman-@xmath0 at ) allowed the discovery of the group of 17 candidate  objects within @xmath121 mpc@xmath49 reported by p96b .",
    "a similar finding , using infrared filters to trace redshifted h@xmath0 , has been reported by malkan , teplitz , & mclean ( 1996 ) at @xmath50 .",
    "the cycle 6 images presented in this paper used the same medium - band  filter ( f410 m ) to extend these results . given that the cycle 6 observations are @xmath125060% as deep as the original 53w002 observations and the luminosity function is quite steep at this redshift , we would expect to find @xmath51  candidates in any random part of the sky if the candidates seen around 53w002 are indeed part of an isotropic widespread population .",
    "here we assume that sensitivity roughly scales as the square root of the exposure time and that the 53w002 field is a representative high - redshift field .",
    "if , for some reason , possibly because of the existence of the weak radio source and/or because of the existence of several agn surrounding 53w002 ( windhorst , keel , & pascarelle 1998 ) , this field is not representative at , then we should find very few ( if any ) significant  candidates in any of the random field searches .",
    "however , we found three candidates in the 21@xmath18 field , 11 in the 16@xmath18 field , and four in the 10@xmath18 field ( see fig .",
    "currently , there are seven spectroscopically confirmed out of the 17 total  candidates in the 53w002 field with three negative confirmations ( p96b ; armus 1998 ) .",
    "this implies a @xmath1270% success rate for the medium - band method of finding lyman-@xmath0 emitting candidates at high redshift . to fairly compare the 53w002 field to the three cycle 6 parallel fields",
    ", we must take into account the relative depths of the observations and the probable steepness of the  luminosity function .",
    "we consider all four fields only down to the f410 m completeness limit of the _ shallowest _ parallel observation ( the 21@xmath18 field at @xmath52=25 mag ) .",
    "the 53w002 field has ten candidates brighter than this magnitude limit , and assuming a @xmath1270% success rate , this yields seven  objects .",
    "the cycle 6 data , for which we have not yet attempted any spectroscopy , will yield one object ( out of the two candidates above the completeness limit ) from the 21@xmath18 field , eight objects ( out of the 11 candidates above the completeness limit ) from the 16@xmath18 field , and two objects ( out of the three candidates above the completeness limit ) from the 10@xmath18 field .",
    "clearly , the 16@xmath18 field is consistent with the 53w002 field , while the other two fields have a lower density .",
    "the most striking aspect of these data is the significant difference in the numbers of candidates from these four fields after correcting them to the depth of the 21@xmath18 field .",
    "for any two such fields , the significance of the different number densities can be represented by : @xmath53 this calculation , in which @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the numbers of candidates in each field , indicates that a 2@xmath21 difference exists between the 21@xmath56 ( or 10@xmath18 ) field and 53w002 ( or 16@xmath18 ) field .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , it may be an indication that the 53w002 and 16@xmath18 fields are _ not _ representative of high - redshift fields .",
    "this would mean that they may be a @xmath122@xmath21 statistical fluctuation with respect to other fields , based on the numbers estimated above .",
    "second , as noted in p96b , the confirmed 53w002 candidates show a remarkably small group velocity dispersion ( @xmath57 km / s ) , despite the much larger width of the f410 m filter .",
    "we could have seen lyman-@xmath0 emission from objects in the entire redshift range @xmath58 , although some dropoff in transmission would occur for @xmath102.30 and @xmath102.42 .",
    "this implies that the sub - galactic clumps may have existed to some extent in groups or clusters at high redshift , or else we should have seen a larger number of objects at other redshifts ( @xmath59 ) inside the f410 m filter .",
    "currently , we have found only one object ( out of seven ) which has a highly discrepant redshift ( @xmath10=2.451 ) , surprisingly far out into the red wing of the filter . some level of clustering ,",
    "therefore , can explain the statistically marginal variation in density of the candidates from field to field .",
    "indeed , such a structure may have also been discovered at @xmath60 by steidel ( 1998 ) , lending further evidence that large - scale structure may have existed at high redshifts .",
    "the space density of the  candidates from p96b is @xmath120.038 mpc@xmath61 , assuming that lyman-@xmath0 lies somewhere within the f410 m filter and a @xmath1270% success rate (= 7 objects out of 10 , if we consider candidates only down to the limiting f410 m magnitude of the shallowest parallel observation ) . under the same assumptions , we find space densities of @xmath120.0054 mpc@xmath61 , @xmath120.043 mpc@xmath61 , and @xmath120.011 mpc@xmath61 for the 21@xmath18 , 16@xmath18 , and 10@xmath18 fields respectively",
    "one can see that the 53w002 and 16@xmath18 fields could be a factor of 34 times more dense than the other two cycle 6 fields . unlike the 53w002 field",
    ", the 16@xmath18 field was not targeted around an _ a priori _ known density fluctuation such as that which might be expected in the field surrounding the weak radio galaxy 53w002 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 10@xmath18 field , which has a comparatively lower space density of candidates , was imaged in parallel to an foc observation of the lensed object iras 10214 + 4721 at @xmath10=2.30 , so that any associated large - scale structure would be just within our sensitivity range .    the variation in number density among the cycle 5 and 6 fields , if significant , is indeed suggestive of the existence of some kind of structure ( _ e.g. _ , groups , clusters , or `` sheets '' at @xmath1 ) .",
    "we appear to have hit such a structure in the 53w002 and 16@xmath18 fields , but are perhaps looking `` in between '' any such major structures in the 21@xmath18 and 10@xmath18 fields .",
    "the small velocity dispersion of the confirmed 53w002 field objects implies that we may be viewing such a sheet more `` face - on '' than `` edge - on , '' since the velocity dispersion would likely be much higher if a , _",
    "e.g. _ , 128 mpc structure ( _ cf . _ , broadhurst 1990 ; landy 1996 ; le fvre 1994 ) was viewed edge - on .",
    "a picture is beginning to develop here which is quite consistent with that of rhs97 , in which luminous galaxies at @xmath10=0 are broken up into several individual clumps at higher redshifts and are embedded in sheet- or ribbon - like structures , often lying along filaments on these sheets .",
    "these sheets appear to be group or sub - cluster size , and may represent the preferred environment for the formation of high - redshift objects .",
    "even the somewhat higher luminosity objects of steidel ( 1996a , b ) , madau ( 1996 ) , and lowenthal ( 1997 ) seem to show hints of this structure , with several pairs and triplets having very similar redshifts ( three of five redshifts of star - forming lyman - limit `` drop - out '' galaxies in the hdf from steidel ( 1996a ) are at @xmath62 ) . also , there is the significant peak in @xmath63 at @xmath60 over an 11@xmath648area on the sky recently reported by steidel ( 1998 ) .",
    "we attempt to construct a lf for the  candidates from all four fields based on their f450w luminosities .",
    "the  synthetic magnitudes were converted to ab magnitudes and number densities were calculated using the comoving volume defined by the redshift range of the f410 m passband and the angular size of the  field at . to properly represent the fainter luminosity bins , in which the shallower parallel fields become incomplete , we omit candidates from fields that are not fully complete in any given luminosity bin . the corresponding volume used in the number density calculation",
    "is decreased accordingly , and the result is a fair indication of the luminosity function of lyman-@xmath0 emitting candidates at , if the 53w002 field is representative at this redshift .",
    "we plot these data in figure 5 as the filled triangles .    for comparison ,",
    "we include in figure 5 a schechter lf fit ( solid curve ) to the @xmath10=23 hdf field galaxy data , represented by the filled squares , from sawicki , lin , & yee ( 1997 , hereafter sly97 ) .",
    "sly97 find from photometric redshifts a lf for galaxies in the hdf that changes with redshift , showing both a brightening and steepening of the hdf lf with increasing redshift up to @xmath11 .",
    "their data are in agreement with the lf of deep galaxy redshift surveys at @xmath101 , _ e.g. _ , the cfrs ( lilly 1995 , 1996 ; lefevre 1996 ) .",
    "sly97 point out that the flattening of the faint - end slope of the hdf luminosity function is an expected result of hierarchical models of galaxy formation , in which merging plays an important role in removing the sub - galactic clumps at lower redshifts .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 , our  lf is quite consistent with that of the hdf of sly97 for @xmath65 to about m@xmath66 , below which the completeness limit of m@xmath67 mag imposed by our much shallower f410 m observations takes over .",
    "our points are slightly lower than the sly97 data , but the results of steidel ( 1996a , b ) , lowenthal ( 1997 ) , and trager ( 1997 ) show that as much as 50% of their @xmath10=23 objects lack significant lyman-@xmath0 emission . correcting our data for this would move our points up by a small amount ( @xmath120.3 dex ) .",
    "we show the corrected data points as the empty triangles .",
    "the consistency , to within the errors , of our data with that of sly97 after correcting for this factor of two supports the idea that the  clumps are a significant contribution to the faint - end @xmath10=23 galaxy counts ( @xmath1250% ) .",
    "it should be mentioned in this context that the scientific return from a minimal investment of exposure time in the hdf and in the upcoming hdf south through the f410 m and f467 m filters would be considerable , since all the broadband @xmath68 data are ( or will be ) in hand .",
    "this would be an excellent direct determination of the space density of high - redshift , lyman-@xmath0 emitting sub - galactic clumps .",
    "we have obtained cycle 6  images of three random fields with the f410 m filter to test the idea that the sub - galactic clumps reported by p96 are not unique to the 53w002 field ( due to the presence of the radio galaxy ) but are a widespread population that exist all over the sky .",
    "we also attempt to use the data to constrain whether or not these objects tend to be in groups or clusters at high redshift . we have found a total of 18 candidate lyman-@xmath0 emitting objects in the three parallel  fields , of which @xmath1213 are expected to be spectroscopically confirmed if we assume the current success rate for the 53w002 field ( @xmath1270% ) .",
    "most of these candidates appear to be as faint and compact as the cycle 5 objects , implying that the 53w002 field is not unique , and that these faint sub - galactic clumps were quite common at early epochs .",
    "perhaps it is not that surprising to find  objects all over the sky in light of the large number of @xmath693 objects of steidel ( 1998 ) , as well as photometric redshift samples that find peaks in the redshift distribution close to this value ( , gwyn & hartwick 1996 in the hdf ) and point to a peak for star formation in disk galaxies at @xmath70 ( pei & fall 1995 ; madau 1996 ; connolly 1997 ) .",
    "the relatively large difference in the object counts of the three fields also hints that these objects may preferentially exist in groups , clusters , or `` sheets , '' not unlike the theoretical picture presented by rhs97 .    because of the existence of only two  filters on  suitable for finding compact emission - line objects ( the f410 m and f467 m filters ) ,",
    "we were limited in the number of redshifts we could search (  and @xmath71 ) .",
    "the narrow - band filters available to  are not wide enough to sample more than a fraction of a single redshift `` sheet , '' if galaxies trace such structures at high redshifts as they appear to at low redshifts ( landy 1995 ; cohen 1996 ) . from this perspective , the narrow  filters are rather unsuitable for the purpose of locating larger numbers of high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 emitting objects .",
    "it should also be noted that such observations will not be possible with the advanced camera because it does not have the appropriate medium - band filter set , and the field - of - view of its linear ramp filters is too small .    the cycles 5 and 6 data offered us a unique opportunity to examine the epoch , but similar observations with the f467 m filter on  and with ( hopefully ) a more extensive filter set on the next generation space telescope will surely need to be carried out . indeed more random observations in f410 m itself are still necessary to confirm these initial findings and improve upon our statistics .",
