    "in this work , we use fragmentation theory to study an infinite random triangulation of the unit disk that arises as the limit of several recursive models . let us describe a special case of these models in order to introduce our main object of interest .",

    "we then construct inductively a  sequence @xmath7 of random closed subsets of the ( closed ) unit disk @xmath8 . to begin with , @xmath9 just consists of the chord with endpoints @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which we denote by @xmath12 $ ] . then at step @xmath13 , we consider two cases .",

    "]    the closed set @xmath20 is a geodesic lamination of the unit disk , in the sense that it is a closed union of noncrossing chords ( here we say that two chords do not cross if they do not intersect except possibly at their endpoints ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the general notion of a geodesic lamination of a surface in the setting of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we may also view @xmath20 as an infinite triangulation of the unit disk , in the same sense as in aldous @xcite .",
    "precisely ,  @xmath20 is a closed subset of @xmath8 , which has zero lebesgue measure and is such that any connected component of @xmath21 is a triangle whose vertices belong to the circle @xmath6 .",

    "then , for every @xmath23 , we let  @xmath24 be the number of chords in @xmath15 that intersect the chord @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "part ( i ) of the theorem is a rather simple consequence of the results in  @xcite , but part ( ii ) is more delicate and requires different tools . in the present work ,",
    "we prove ( more general versions of ) the convergences in ( i ) and ( ii ) by using fragmentation theory . to this end , we consider continuous - time models where noncrossing chords are thrown at random in the unit disk according to the following device : at time  @xmath32",
    ", the existing chords bound several subdomains of the disk , and a new chord is created in one of these subdomains at a rate which is a given power of the lebesgue measure of the portion of the circle that is adjacent to this subdomain .",
    "it is not hard to see that the random closed subset of @xmath8 obtained by taking the closure of all chords created in this process has the same distribution as @xmath20 , and moreover the case when the power is the square is very closely related to the discrete - time model described above .    in this continuous - time model , the ranked sequence of the lebesgue measures of the portions of @xmath6 corresponding to the subdomains bounded by the existing chords at time @xmath32 forms a conservative fragmentation process , in the sense of @xcite . a general version of the convergence ( i )",
    "can then be obtained as a consequence of asymptotics for fragmentation processes .",
    "similarly , if @xmath33 is a random point uniformly distributed on @xmath6 and if we look only at subdomains that intersect the chord @xmath34 $ ] , we get another ( dissipative ) fragmentation process , and known asymptotics give the convergence in ( ii ) , provided that @xmath35 is replaced by the random point  @xmath33 . an extra absolute continuity argument is then needed to get the desired result for a deterministic point @xmath35 : see theorem [ tech ] and its proof .",
    "it is plausible that the convergence in ( ii ) also holds almost surely , but the known asymptotics for fragmentation processes do not give this stronger form .",
