    "h  ii regions are photoionized regions surrounding young ob stars .",
    "the ionization structures and physical properties of these regions are important to understanding of the formation of massive stars and their feedback to the environment . over the past several decades ,",
    "h  ii regions have been extensively observed in various size and shapes ( e.g. see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "depending on their sizes , they are usually classified as ultracompact ( linear size below 0.1  pc ) , compact ( 0.11  pc ) , or extended ( several to tens of parsecs ) .",
    "ultracompact and compact h  ii regions are ionized by massive stars still embedded in their natal molecular clouds , while extended h  ii regions are thought to be in their mature states , powered by a combination of stellar radiation , stellar wind and supernova explosions in the associated ob star clusters ( yang et al .",
    "despite the diversity of sizes , h  ii regions generally display common features such as inhomogeneities and irregular shapes .",
    "one interesting and still open question on the origin of these complex structures is : are they from the initial conditions of the gas before ionization , or formed by dynamical processes during h  ii region evolution ?",
    "early analytical and numerical work focused on the formation of h  ii regions and the propagation of ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) , by modeling the ionization of a massive star suddenly turned on in a uniform gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was soon realized , however , that the interstellar medium is far from homogeneous .",
    "simple condensations or smooth variations of density were then included in some model calculations ( @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , in the early studies , radiative transfer effects were either ignored in calculations or limited to one or two - dimensional treatments , and suffered from low resolutions ( @xcite ) , which limited their applications to observations .",
    "recently , several authors have reported two - dimensional simulations of the dynamical evolution of h  ii regions and their applications to observations .",
    "@xcite presented two - dimensional gasdynamical simulations of the evolution of h  ii regions in constant and power - law density profiles , and argued that a thin - shell instability of the ionization fronts could produce the irregular and bright edges of the h  ii region .",
    "@xcite also performed two - dimensional gasdynamical simulations and showed that shadowing instability could also lead to formation of dense clumps .",
    "@xcite presented two - dimensional radiation gasdynamical simulations of the interaction between an isolated massive star and its homogeneous and quiescent ambient ism , and showed that the redistribution of mass by the action of the stellar wind shell could form the `` finger - like '' shapes .",
    "however , since star forming regions display a wide range of kinematic properties and density distributions , the gas may well be turbulent , clumpy , filamentary , and coupled with the magnetic field ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these uniform models may not capture the realistic density field of the ambient medium .",
    "the initial inhomogeneities and turbulent structures of the gas clouds may affect the propagation of the ionization fronts and contribute to the shaping of the resulting h  ii regions .    to test this ,",
    "a reliable , three - dimensional treatment of radiative processes is essential , and high resolution simulations of radiative transfer fully coupled with gasdynamics in turbulent medium are highly desirable .",
    "however , incorporating radiative transfer in gasdynamics simulation presents a serious numerical challenge .",
    "the difficulties are due to the non - locality of the radiation physics , which hampers efficient parallelization of the simulations and severely limits the size of problem that can be tackled .",
    "so far most calculations have not been able to include transfer of ionizing radiation into three - dimensional gasdynamics simulations , so , as a step forward to investigate the ionization of turbulent clouds , we apply radiative transfer to a static , pre - computed , three - dimensional , turbulent density field .",
    "it is a simplified model , but so long as the speed of the i - front is much larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas , the expansion of the gas can be neglected @xcite , and the density field can be treated as static . in cases where a magnetic i - front is considered ( e.g. @xcite ) , the alfvn speed in the mostly neutral gas ahead of the i - front should replace the ionized sound speed in the above criterion if it is larger",
    ". however , usually the ionized sound speed dominates .",
    "as we will show , this simple approach produces a variety of interesting morphological structures that may provide us some understanding of the physical processes in h  ii regions even before more sophisticated calculations can be performed .",
    "however , our results only apply to the initial photoionization of static turbulence before gasdynamics becomes important , so future comprehensive simulations with a full treatment that couples radiative transfer and gasdynamics will be necessary to confirm and extend them .    we present high resolution computations of the initial ionization of compressible turbulence by a point ionizing source , such as a young star .",
    "we apply inone , a three - dimensional radiative transfer code developed by @xcite , to a compressible turbulent medium from different hydrodynamical ( hd ) and magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) models using zeus-3d ( @xcite ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "inone integrates the jump condition of i - fronts , and uses a photon - conserving method that is independent of numerical resolution and ensures correct propagation speeds for the i - fronts @xcite . in  [ sec_com ]",
    "we briefly describe the methods of computation , and the codes and models used in this work ; we present the results of propagation of i - fronts , emission measure maps , and ionization structures in  [ sec_result ] ; and in  [ sec_discussion ]",
    "we give an analytical discussion of the key parameters that determine the ionization structure , as well as the validity of the assumptions .",
    "star forming molecular clouds have been observed to be highly clumpy and have broad emission line widths , which suggests supersonic motions in the clouds @xcite .",
    "these supersonic motions seem not to be ordered .",
    "@xcite presented zeeman observations of magnetic fields in molecular clouds that showed that velocities in the observed clouds are typically alfvnic .",
    "so molecular clouds are generally self - gravitating , clumpy , magnetized , turbulent , compressible fluids .",
    "although numerical simulations of transient , compressible turbulent molecular clouds have been carried out for several years , we are far from drawing a comprehensive picture of the complicated structure of the clouds .",
    "@xcite conducted direct numerical computations of uniform , randomly driven turbulence with @xmath3 resolution using the zeus-3d mhd code , which successfully simulated the density distribution of the turbulent medium .",
    "zeus-3d is a well - tested , eulerian , finite - difference code @xcite .",
    "it uses second - order @xcite advection and resolves shocks using von neumann artificial viscosity .",
    "it also includes magnetic fields in the mhd approximation @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out some problems with zeus : rarefaction waves often break up into a series of jumps , and adiabatic mhd shocks sometimes show errors .",
    "however , as we are using isothermal mhd , and are primarily concerned with the density field , which is barely affected by rarefaction shocks , our models remain valid .",

    "in general , a study of the evolution of ionization zones around a ionizing source requires a full solution to the radiative transfer equation @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a unit vector along the direction of the radiation , @xmath11 is the monochromatic specific intensity of the radiation field , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are emission and absorption coefficients , respectively .",
    "however , a direct solution of equation ( [ rt_kir ] ) is usually impractical because of its high dimensionality .",
    "@xcite made the calculations feasible by developing a ray tracing algorithm for radial radiative transfer around point sources , reducing the dimensionality of the transfer equation to a level where ionization can be computed on a cartesian grid .",
    "this algorithm conserves energy explicitly and thus gives the right speed of i - fronts , but ignores the diffuse field produced by scattered radiation .",
    "@xcite defined the nomenclature of @xmath14 ( `` rarefied '' ) and @xmath15 ( `` dense '' ) fronts according to the speed of the i - fronts with respect to the sound speed of the ionized gas : r - type fronts move supersonically while d - type fronts move subsonically .",
    "if a source of ionizing radiation suddenly switches on , the i - front is initially weak r - type .",
    "once its velocity drops to about twice the sound speed in the ionized gas , the i - front becomes d - type @xcite .",
    "the propagation of an r - type i - front in a static medium is given as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radius of the i - front , @xmath18 is the ionizing photon flux , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number density of the neutrals , ions , and electrons , respectively .",
    "we assume a constant case b recombination rate , @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 for @xmath25 k. integrating equation ( [ eq_if ] ) along the rays with the ray - tracing technique mentioned above gives the time at which the ionization front arrives at a given cell , as is done in inone @xcite .",
    "retrieving the arrival time in a 3d array allows one to investigate the time dependent morphology of the i - fronts .      in this paper",
    ", we use inone to compute photoionization of different turbulence models . for simplicity , we consider hydrogen gas only .",
    "we expect the inclusion of helium to have only a minor effect on the results presented here .",
    "the simulations are scale free and depend only on the ionizing flux @xmath18 and density @xmath1 of the medium , so one can derive the scaling of physical parameters such as ionized mass @xmath26 , ionized volume @xmath27 , and ionization time @xmath28 in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath1 . as the analytical derivation in ",
    "[ sec_is ] demonstrates , the ionized mass at late times scales as @xmath29 ; the ionized volume at late times is close to the volume of the strmgren sphere , and scales as @xmath30 ; and the characteristic timescale is the recombination time , which scales as @xmath31 . as an example , if we choose @xmath32 s@xmath24 , which is typical for an o6 star @xcite , and a cloud with a size of 0.5 pc and average density of @xmath33 @xmath34 , we then have @xmath35 , @xmath36 pc@xmath37 , and @xmath38 s ( these will be given in  [ sec_result ] as the results of the simulations ) . for given f and n",
    ", one can rescale our results as follows : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41    in the simulations , we use the pre - computed gas density distribution with zeus-3d for the hd and mhd models listed in table 1 as input into inone .",
    "we will discuss the validity of this treatment later in ",
    "[ subsec_valid ] .",
    "three simulations are conducted for each model , by varying the position of the star to the maximum density , minimum density , or center of the density field ( random density ) , so for our example a total of 30 simulations were performed on sgi origin2000 computers .",
    "each computation took several days on a single processor .",
    "figures  [ fig_hd ] and  [ fig_mhd ] show the propagation of the i - fronts into the turbulent medium surrounding a point source .",
    "the background image is the density distribution of the gas simulated by hd and mhd models , respectively .",
    "the contours are the arrival times of the i - fronts . in figure",
    "[ fig_hd ] , the density fields are taken from hd models with different energy input and driving wave number , while in figure  [ fig_mhd ] , the density fields are from mhd models with different driving wave number and magnetic field strength , as listed in table 1 . in both figures , the left panels are for the case that the point source ( star ) is placed at the maximum density , while in the right panels the star is placed at the minimum density . in each individual panel , the contours give the position of the i - fronts in our example scaling from 0.1 to 100 years , with the interval increasing evenly by a factor of 10 . the models chosen in each figure have different average clumping factors ( see table 1 ) .",
    "at early times , the recombination term in equation ( [ eq_if ] ) can be neglected , and the i - front velocity is determined by the local density structure of the gas : the front travels faster into voids and slower into denser filaments .",
    "the shape of the i - front depends on the size and contrast of the voids and clumps .",
    "longer turbulent driving wavelengths ( smaller driving wave numbers ) create structure in the density field on larger scales and produce more asymmetric h  ii regions with characteristic butterfly shapes . at later times , recombination becomes significant , increasing the dependence on local density and making the resulting asymmetry more pronounced .",
    "the initial i - front velocity is sensitive to the placement of the ionizing point source , as can be seen from a comparison of the innermost contours in the left - hand and right - hand columns of figures  [ fig_hd ] and  [ fig_mhd ] .",
    "however , this effect becomes less important at later times , and the final h  ii regions of the same model have very similar sizes , regardless the position of the ionizing source , as can be seen in figures  [ fig_vol ] .    in figures  [ fig_hd ] and  [ fig_mhd ] ,",
    "the images are sorted in order of increasing clumping factor @xmath7 ; e.g. in figure [ fig_hd ] @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and similar trend in figure  [ fig_mhd ] .",
    "comparison of the images clearly shows a strong link between the size of the clumping factor and the morphology of the h  ii region ",
    "the larger the clumping factor , the more asymmetric the h  ii region becomes .      for comparison with observations , we can map the emission measure in our models , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the size of the region along the line - of - sight .",
    "typically more compact h  ii regions have higher emission measures .",
    "for example , an extended h  ii region with size of 10100 pc and density of 10 @xmath34 has em in the range of 10@xmath47 pc @xmath48 , while an ultracompact h  ii region with size @xmath49  pc and density @xmath50 @xmath34 is brighter , with em @xmath51 pc @xmath48 .",
    "we calculate emission measure maps from the simulations by integrating density @xmath52 of the ionized regions through the path length in the third direction .",
    "figures [ fig_em_hd ] and  [ fig_em_mhd ] show emission measure maps in the x - y plane of hd and mhd models , respectively .",
    "the arrangement of the models in both figures are the same as in figures  [ fig_hd ] and [ fig_mhd ] .",
    "we can see that the range of the em is around @xmath53 pc @xmath48 for our adopted parameters , which agrees , as expected , with the observed range of compact h  ii regions .",
    "the shape and structure of the em map depends on the clumping factor : the smaller the clumping factor is , the more spherical the map appears .",
    "filamentary structures and contrast within the h  ii region also increase with @xmath7 .",
    "there are some differences between the hd and mhd models with @xmath54 : hd models tend to have more irregular shapes , and bigger voids and clumps .",
    "larger driving wavelengths of the turbulence also produce larger voids and clumps .",
    "these results generally suggest that the turbulent structures observed in h  ii regions may be driven at large scale , and that the initial gas clouds may have a large clumping factor .",
    "however , the influence of dynamics will have to be computed to put any such conclusion on a firm basis .",
    "figures  [ fig_imas ] and  [ fig_vol ] show the time - dependent ionized mass and ionized volume , respectively .",
    "note that the units , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the same as in equations ( [ eq_mas ] ) , ( [ eq_vol ] ) , and ( [ eq_tim ] ) .",
    "different panels have the ionizing star at different positions , while within each panel , different curves indicate different models .",
    "the ionized volume is calculated by integrating the ionized cells at time t , and the ionized mass is the integral of the mass encompassed in the ionized volume .",
    "the curves become saturated around @xmath58 years .",
    "it appears that the mass of the ionized gas in our example is close to that of a compact h  ii region @xcite . for the same input energy strength and driving wave number",
    ", no big difference is seen between the mhd and the hd models . however , all the curves follow a sorted order of the clumping factor @xmath7 , with ha8 and ma81 having the smallest @xmath7 , while he2 has the largest @xmath7 .      here",
    "we compare our results with an analytic model of a two - phase clumpy medium .",
    "consider a medium with optically thin clumps of number density @xmath59 in a uniform density field of number density @xmath60 , which was studied by @xcite .",
    "if we take a filling factor @xmath61 for clumps , and the density contrast @xmath62 , then the average density is : @xmath63\\,,\\ ] ] the ionization structure of this medium is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the recombination - rate coefficient as in equation ( [ eq_if ] ) .",
    "define a two - phase clumping factor @xmath66 , @xmath67 and define @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total number of ions .",
    "equation ( [ eq_clumpy ] ) can then be written as @xmath70 from which we get an analytical solution of the number of the ions n , and the ionized mass @xmath71 : @xmath72    figure  [ fig_2phase ] shows the ionized mass from the two - phase model , and a comparison between the analytical results and the numerical ones .",
    "the clumping factors @xmath73 were chosen to be close to the values measured in the turbulence simulations , as listed in table 1 . from top to bottom in the plot , we have 1.0 ( uniform gas ) , 1.5 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 and 7.3 respectively . the background density @xmath74 is taken as the mean density @xmath75 @xmath34 of the scaled simulations . though similar in shape ,",
    "the results of the two - phase model are distinct from those of the turbulent models ; the ionized mass for a given @xmath73 is less than in the corresponding turbulent model , and the difference increases as the medium becomes more clumpy .",
    "we have presented simulations of different models , and found that a two - phase clumpy model can not fully describe the ionization structure of the turbulence models .",
    "however , some questions still remain : what determines the ionization structure ? when are our assumptions valid ?",
    "the results shown above suggest that the ionization structure is sensitive to the input energy strength and driving wave number of the turbulence . but",
    "qualitatively , what is the key factor that determines the ionization structure ?    assume the density field is constant , and the gas is fully ionized within the ionization front , then both the ion density @xmath76 and the electron density @xmath77 at radius @xmath78 are equal to the original hydrogen density @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the total number of the ions at time t , @xmath82 , then equation ( [ eq_if ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath83    we can now see that the ionized mass depends explicitly on the average gas density @xmath84 , and the local clumping factor ( @xmath85 ) within the i - front .",
    "different driving strength and wave number of the turbulence yield different size and contrast of clumps and voids , which is represented by @xmath7 and @xmath84 , thus yielding different ionization structures . since @xmath17 changes with time",
    ", we further define an effective clumping factor @xmath86 , so that equation ( [ dndt1 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath87    from this we can see that @xmath2 describes the density field , and determines the ionized mass .",
    "figure  [ fig_clum ] shows @xmath2 as a function of time for our models . comparing figure  [ fig_clum ] with figure [ fig_imas ] , we find that the order of the models in figure  [ fig_clum ] is exactly the inverse order in figure  [ fig_imas ] .",
    "the larger the @xmath2 , the less mass is ionized , as predicted from equation [ if_ana1 ] .",
    "the dependence of the effective clumping factor @xmath88 on the density field is nontrivial because the averaging volume is itself a time - dependent function of the density field .",
    "however , @xmath2 tends to saturate once the radius of the i - front is larger than the turbulence driving scale .",
    "this also corresponds to the saturation of the photoionization .",
    "the total ionized mass can then be approximated well with equation  [ if_ana1 ] .",
    "note also that in these figures , different positions of the ionizing star does not make much difference , because @xmath2 is a measure of the density field , and the ionized mass depends only on @xmath2 and the ionizing flux , no matter where the source is . in turbulence simulations ,",
    "resolution might affect the value of @xmath2 , but it would not affect our result as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig_mas_comp ] shows a comparison of numerical and analytical values of ionized mass for the different models .",
    "the small variance between numerical simulations and analytical calculations suggests that the calculations are self - consistent , and that the numerical resolution of the calculation is good enough to resolve the structure . since in reality the density fields are more complicated than the simplified model used in the analytical calculations ,",
    "there is a systematic difference between the numerical results and the analytical ones : in all these models , the smaller the clumping factor , the smaller the difference .      in the above simulations , the density field of the gas is simulated beforehand and then input to inone , so gasdynamics is not computed simultaneously during the course of radiative transfer . however , when the speed of the i - fronts slows to roughly twice the sound speed of the ionized gas , the expansion of the gas will dominate the evolution of the region , and gasdynamics must be considered @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_vel ] shows the time evolution of the ratio of speed of i - fronts @xmath89 to sound speed @xmath90 , @xmath91 , for different models .",
    "the sound speed is @xmath92 km s@xmath24 for @xmath93 k. the velocity of the i - fronts , @xmath94 , is hard to derive because it is three dimensional , and even at the same photon arrival time , it may vary dramatically in different cells if the local clumping factors are different , so what is shown here is an average value at @xmath95 , the radius of the i - front at time t. however , one should keep in mind that in some regions @xmath89 may be much smaller than the average value .",
    "for example , an obliquely propagating ionization front moves slowly and transitions from r - type to d - type more quickly ( @xcite ) .",
    "fully dynamical simulations are necessary to assess the impact of these effects . from figure  [ fig_vel ]",
    ", we can see that the speed of i - fronts decreases rapidly with time , and at about log@xmath96 ( which corresponds to @xmath97 years in our example ) , it drops to twice of the sound speed , so after this time the simulations are likely unreliable . from figure  [ fig_imas ] and  [ fig_vol ]",
    ", we can see that this is the time when the curves of ionized mass and ionized volume become saturated , so the details of the ionization structure derived up to that point are likely reliable .",
    "@xcite presented one - dimensional simulations on jump conditions of magnetic i - fronts and showed that fast r - type i - fronts could decrease quickly to slow d - type i - fronts in oblique magnetic fields .",
    "we note , however , that as long as the propagation speed of the i - fronts is much larger than the alfvn speed of the medium , this effect remains unimportant . in molecular clouds ,",
    "the typical alfvn speed is about 15  km  s@xmath24 , which is no larger than the sound speed in ionized gas .",
    "table 1 shows that the ratio of alfvn speed to the sound speed in the mhd models is appropriate for cold , molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite showed an empirical power - law relationship between magnetic field strength and density above @xmath98   @xmath34 . according to this scaling law",
    ", our density field ( @xmath99 @xmath34 ) might have @xmath100 , which gives an alfvn velocity @xmath101 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the ionized sound speed @xmath92 km s@xmath24 , larger than the alfvn speed @xmath102 , which suggests that our critical point log@xmath103 occurs before the magnetic field becomes important .",
    "again , it should be emphasized that our simulations are simplified models in which a point ionizing source is turned on in a static turbulent density field .",
    "we did not take into account several effects , such as the mass accretion by the ionizing star , the diffuse field , and any time evolution in the ionizing luminosity of the star @xcite .",
    "these effects should eventually be included in more comprehensive future simulations .",
    "our main focus here is to investigate how the initial conditions of the gas affect the ionization structures of the resulting h  ii region .",
    "we have presented a study of the effects of turbulent initial conditions on the ionization structures of young h  ii regions .",
    "we performed high resolution , three - dimensional radiative transfer computations , as well as analytical calculations , of the propagation of i - fronts into static density distributions drawn from numerical simulations of compressible , turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "our results show that the initial turbulent structure of the gas can play an important role in the early ionization structure .",
    "the propagation of the i - fronts , the shape of the resulting h  ii regions , and the total mass ionized depend on the local strength of the voids and clumps .",
    "we can characterize this with an effective clumping factor @xmath104 .",
    "the ionization fronts move quickly into voids but slowly into dense filaments .",
    "the ionized mass changes inversely with @xmath2 . cuts through the ionized regions generally have  butterfly \" shapes , with larger @xmath2 producing more irregular shapes .",
    "larger scale driving of the turbulence produces more filamentary emission measure maps .",
    "we emphasize that our results are based on static density fields , so they apply only to the early stages of the evolution of an h  ii region when the speed of the ionization fronts remains much larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas , so that the expansion of the gas is negligible .",
    "( in cases where magnetic field is considered , the neutral alfvn speed should be used in addition to the ionized sound speed , but it is rarely higher . ) we regard our results as complementary to the findings of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who study the dynamical evolution of h  ii regions with two - dimensional simulations , but only with uniform or smoothly varying initial conditions .",
    "future comprehensive simulations with a full treatment that couples gas dynamics and radiative transfer , and with realistic initial conditions , will be necessary to extend these results to later times .",
