    "in recent years , the amount of dark matter in the universe has become precisely known , but its particle identity remains a mystery .",
    "current observational constraints require that the bulk of dark matter be non - baryonic , cold or warm , and stable or long - lived .",
    "these constraints are easy to satisfy , and viable candidates have been proposed with masses and interaction strengths that span many , many orders of magnitude .    at the same time , there are strong reasons to focus on candidates with masses around the weak scale @xmath0 . despite significant progress",
    "since this scale was first identified in the work of fermi in the 1930 s , the origin of @xmath1 is still unknown , and every attempt to understand it so far introduces new particles at this scale .",
    "furthermore , the relic density of such particles naturally reproduces the required dark matter density .",
    "if a new ( heavy ) particle @xmath2 is initially in thermal equilibrium , it can be shown that its relic density today is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thermally - averaged annihilation cross section , and we have parametrized it in terms of a mass scale @xmath5 and coupling constant @xmath6 that characterize @xmath7 annihilation . including all relevant numerical factors , for weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the resulting relic density is @xmath10 , near the required value for dark matter @xmath11 .",
    "this remarkable coincidence is the `` wimp miracle . ''",
    "it implies that particle physics theories designed to explain the origin of the weak scale often naturally contain particles with the right relic density to be dark matter .    for wimps @xmath2 to have the right relic density , they must annihilate through @xmath12 interactions , where , in the simplest cases",
    ", @xmath13 denotes any of the known standard model particles .",
    "this implies that dark matter can be detected through @xmath14 scattering ( direct detection ) , or through its annihilations @xmath15 ( indirect detection ) .",
    "both strategies are currently vigorously pursued , and some recent highlights are briefly reviewed in the next two sections .",
    "dark matter scattering is either spin - independent or spin - dependent  @xcite .",
    "current bounds and supersymmetric predictions for spin - independent scattering off nucleons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct ] .",
    "as can be seen , current bounds do not test the bulk of supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the experiments are improving rapidly , however , and in the coming year , sensitivities to cross sections of @xmath16 are possible .     from xenon10  @xcite ( solid red ) and cdms  @xcite ( dashed blue ) , along with predictions from the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite ( shaded ) and minimal supergravity  @xcite ( outlined ) .",
    "[ fig : direct ] ]    how significant will this progress be ?",
    "as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct ] , the full range of supersymmetric predictions will not be probed for the foreseeable future . however",
    ", many well - known supersymmetric theories predict @xmath17 .",
    "supersymmetric theories suffer from flavor and cp problems : the introduction of squarks and sleptons with generic flavor mixing and weak scale masses induces contributions to @xmath18 mixing , @xmath19 , the electric dipole moments of the neutron and electron , and a host of other flavor- or cp - violating observables that badly violate known constraints .",
    "one generic solution to this problem is to assume heavy squarks and sleptons , so that they decouple and do not affect low - energy observables .    in general , the dominant contributions to neutralino annihilation are @xmath20 through @xmath21-channel squarks and sleptons , and @xmath22 through @xmath21-channel charginos and neutralinos . in these decoupling theories ,",
    "the first diagrams are ineffective , and so annihilation takes place through the second class of diagrams . essentially , two parameters enter these diagrams : the neutralino s mass and its higgsino content . to keep the relic density constant ,",
    "larger @xmath23 masses are compensated by larger higgsino components . in these models , then , the supersymmetry parameter space is greatly reduced , with @xmath24 essentially determined by the @xmath23 mass .",
    "more detailed study shows that @xmath24 is in fact fairly constant , with values near @xmath25 , irrespective of mass .    in the next year or so , then , direct detection will probe many well - known supersymmetric models with widely varying motivations , from focus point models  @xcite to split supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "so far , direct detection experiments have trimmed a few fingernails off the body of supersymmetry parameter space , but if nothing is seen in the coming few years , it is arms and legs that will have been lopped off .",
    "in addition to the limits described above , the dama experiment continues to find a signal in annual modulation  @xcite with period and maximum at the expected values  @xcite . from a theorist s viewpoint ,",
    "the dama / libra result has been puzzling because the signal , if interpreted as spin - independent elastic scattering , seemingly implied dark matter masses and scattering cross sections that have been excluded by other experiments .",
    "inelastic scattering has been put forward as one solution  @xcite .",
    "more recently , astrophysics  @xcite and channeling  @xcite , a condensed matter effect that effectively lowers the threshold for crystalline detectors , have been proposed as possible remedies to allow elastic scattering to explain dama without violating other constraints",
    ". if these indications are correct , the favored parameters are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this mass is lower than typically expected , but even massless neutralinos are allowed if one relaxes the constraint of gaugino mass unification  @xcite .",
    "the cross section is , however , very large ; it may be achieved in corners of mssm parameter space  @xcite , but is more easily explained in completely different frameworks , such as those discussed below .",
    "indirect searches look for particles produced when dark matter particles decay or pair annihilate . in contrast to direct detection , there have been many reported anomalies in indirect detection , which have been interpreted as possible evidence for dark matter .",
    "flux measured by atic , fermi , and other experiments  @xcite ( right ) .",
    "[ fig : fermi],title=\"fig : \" ]   flux measured by atic , fermi , and other experiments  @xcite ( right ) .",
    "[ fig : fermi],title=\"fig : \" ]    recently , the pamela and atic collaborations have measured the positron fraction @xmath28  @xcite and the total @xmath29 flux  @xcite , respectively , at energies in the range of 10 gev to 1 tev .",
    "these measurements revealed excesses above the expected cosmic ray background from galprop  @xcite , which have been interpreted as dark matter signals .",
    "the pamela results are , however , consistent with astrophysical sources , such as the predicted fluxes from pulsars , as derived both long before   and after  @xcite the release of the pamela data .",
    "results from a recent study scanning over pulsar characteristics are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] . the atic results",
    "have now been supplemented by high statistics data from the fermi lat collaboration  @xcite , which sees no evidence for a bump ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi ] ) .",
    "additional data on both cosmic rays and gamma rays will provide further insights ( _ e.g. _ , recent gamma ray data already further disfavor some dark matter proposals  @xcite ) and are eagerly anticipated from these experiments and many others .",
    "the dama and other anomalies are not easy to explain with canonical wimps .",
    "this has motivated new candidates .",
    "all solid evidence for dark matter is gravitational , and there is also strong evidence against dark matter having strong or electromagnetic interactions .",
    "a logical alternative to the wimp paradigm , then , is hidden dark matter , that is , dark matter that has no standard model gauge interactions .",
    "hidden dark matter has been explored for decades  @xcite . by considering this possibility , though",
    ", one seemingly loses ( 1 ) a connection to central problems in particle physics , such as the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking , ( 2 ) the wimp miracle , and ( 3 ) the non - gravitational signals discussed above , which are most likely required if we are to identify dark matter .",
    "in fact , however , hidden dark matter may have all three of the virtues listed above .",
    "consider , for example , supersymmetric theories with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite .",
    "these models preserve the many virtues of supersymmetry , while elegantly solving the flavor and cp problems mentioned above . although minimal gmsb models contain only a supersymmetry - breaking sector and the mssm , in models that arise from string theory , hidden sectors are ubiquitous . as a concrete example , we consider gmsb with an additional hidden sector , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sectors ] .    in these models",
    ", supersymmetry is broken when a chiral field in the supersymmetry breaking sector gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting superpartner masses in the mssm and hidden sectors are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and so @xmath33 that is , @xmath34 is determined solely by the supersymmetry - breaking sector . as this is exactly the combination of parameters that determines the thermal relic density of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , the hidden sector automatically includes a dark matter candidate that has the desired thermal relic density , irrespective of its mass .",
    "this is the `` wimpless miracle ''  in these models , a hidden sector particle naturally has the desired thermal relic density , but it has neither a weak - scale mass nor weak force interactions  @xcite .",
    "the wimpless framework opens up many new possibilities for dark matter signals without sacrificing the main motivations for wimps .",
    "for example , if there is an unbroken u(1 ) gauge symmetry in the hidden sector , these dark matter particles self - interact through rutherford scattering , with a wide range of observable implications  @xcite .",
    "-nucleon scattering as a function of dark matter mass @xmath5 .",
    "the black lines are super - k limits  @xcite and projected sensitivities .",
    "the magenta shaded region is dama - favored given channeling and no streams  @xcite , and the medium green shaded region is dama - favored at 3@xmath35 given streams but no channeling  @xcite .",
    "the light yellow shaded region is excluded by the direct detection experiments indicated .",
    "the predictions of wimpless models ( with connector mass @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) lie in the blue shaded region . from ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : superkdirect ] ]    alternatively , if there are connector particles , wimpless dark matter can explain the dama / libra signal  @xcite .",
    "suppose the dark matter particle @xmath2 couples to standard model fermions @xmath13 via exchange of a connector particle @xmath38 through interactions @xmath39 .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath40 are model - dependent . if the dark matter couples mainly to 3rd generation quarks , the dominant nuclear coupling of wimpless dark matter is to gluons via a loop of @xmath41-quarks .",
    "the predictions of this wimpless dark matter model are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : superkdirect ] . in this wimpless scenario ,",
    "the small mass required by dama is as natural as any other because of the wimpless miracle .",
    "the large cross section is also easily achieved , because the heavy @xmath38 propagator flips chirality without yukawa suppression , in contrast to the case of neutralinos .",
    "this explanation is testable through searches for exotic 4th generation quarks at the tevatron and lhc .",
