    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) are the evolved , he - burning descendents of moderately massive ( @xmath10 ) o and b stars .",
    "we have recently used the new generation of marcs stellar atmosphere models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 , 2003 ; plez et al .  1992 ) to fit optical spectrophotometry of 74 milky way rsgs , from which we derived a new effective temperature scale for rsgs of galactic metallicity ( levesque et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a subsample of 62 of these stars belong to ob associations with known distances , which allowed us to determine other physical properties , such as bolometric luminosity and stellar radii , for comparison with those predicted by stellar evolutionary models .",
    "we found excellent agreement , thus removing a major discrepancy between  observation \" and theory for massive star evolution ( see massey 2003 ) .",
    "however , that study underscored the difficulty in correcting for reddening due to dust for these objects ; our work hinted at several previously neglected problems , which we consider more fully here .",
    "first ( sec .  [ sec - rv ] ) , we find that previous efforts involving broad - band filter photometry have led to systematically underestimating the visual extinctions , and thus to underestimating the stellar luminosities .",
    "although we successfully avoided that problem in paper  i by using spectrophotometry to derive reddenings , our work revealed that many of these stars suffer extinction beyond that of their neighboring o and b stars .",
    "we show here ( sec .  [ sec - av ] ) that this is likely caused by circumstellar dust from these  smoky \" stars .",
    "although future studies will attempt to derive the reddening law for this dust , it is already clear that the circumstellar dust results in a near - uv excess compared to the stellar models reddened with the  standard \" reddening law ( sec .",
    "[ sec - nuv ] ) .",
    "finally , we use the results of paper i and the current study to estimate the fraction of dust deposited in the diffuse interstellar medium compared to that of other sources in the galaxy ( sec .",
    "[ sec - cosmic ] ) .",
    "a knowledge of the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath12 is needed in order to derive physical parameters of reddened stars . using _ early - type _ stars with moderate reddenings in the milky way , sneden et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and others found @xmath11 to be typically 3.1 , although it is now well understood that this value is not universal in nature , but represents the average sightline through the diffuse interstellar medium ( valencic et al .",
    "values of @xmath13 and even higher have been found for stars in dense molecular clouds ; see , for example , cardelli & wallerstein ( 1989 ) and cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 , hereafter ccm89 ) .",
    "these _ physical _ variations of @xmath11 are due to differences in the line - of - sight environment , such as the grain size distribution .",
    "however , aside from such real differences in the dust properties , one must employ a larger _ effective _ value of @xmath11 ( which we will denote as @xmath14 ) when correcting broad - band photometry of objects whose spectral energy distributions differ from that of lightly- to moderately - reddened o stars .",
    "this is simply due to the shift of the effective wavelength of the filters compared to that obtained with early - type stars .",
    "a very red star shifts the effective wavelengths of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 filters to longer wavelengths , where extinction is less , making both @xmath15 and @xmath16 smaller for a given amount of dust .",
    "the net effect of lowering @xmath15 and @xmath16 is to _ increase _",
    "@xmath14 , as the decrease in the denominator of the ratio outweighs the decrease of the numerator .",
    "mccall ( 2004 ) has recently emphasized the importance of considering the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source when correcting for extinction in galaxy photometry , as their seds do not , after all , resemble that of the ob stars for which the extinction laws were derived .",
    "we avoided this problem in paper  i by using spectrophotometry of the stars to measure the color excess with regard the marcs models , employing the ccm89 reddening law .",
    "since neither the _ b _ nor _ v _ filters were actually used in our color excesses , conversion to @xmath16 was straight - forward , although it did assume that the reddenings had a  typical \" @xmath3 value . for broad - band photometry of rsgs ,",
    "a value of @xmath17 has usually been adopted ( lee 1970 , humphreys 1978 ) , and is consistent with the scaling of @xmath14 with color proposed by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "however , our work in paper  i has forced us to conclude that this value is not very accurate , as it produced @xmath16 values that were systematically smaller than extinction values derived from our spectrophotometry .",
    "we have derived an improved value for the effective @xmath14 of rsgs by convolving the marcs models with the standard @xmath1 and @xmath0 band - passes ( bessell 1990 ) .",
    "we used the ccm89 reddening law with @xmath3 to add various amounts of reddening to the model spectra ; we then computed the resulting change in the flux in the @xmath0 filter to find @xmath16 , and the differences in the relative fluxes in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 filters ( compared to the no - reddening case ) in order to determine @xmath18 .",
    "the effective value of @xmath19 then follows directly .",
    "we found that there is a significant dependence upon the assumed surface gravity @xmath20 in the sense that stars with higher @xmath20 ( 0.5 ) produce lower @xmath11 values ; the value @xmath17 usually used for rsgs is actually more appropriate to the surface gravities of red dwarfs or giants .",
    "there is very little dependence of @xmath14 on effective temperature in this regime .",
    "this is not surprising , as it is well known that @xmath21 is primarily sensitive to surface gravity rather than temperature for rsgs ; see discussion in massey ( 1998 ) .",
    "stars with higher reddenings require a slightly higher @xmath14 value . in summary , for stars with @xmath20 between -0.5 and 0.5 , @xmath22 between 3400 and 4200 k , and @xmath23 , we find @xmath24 for a  modestly \" reddened rsg , a value of @xmath2 is thus appropriate . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avs ] , this value for @xmath14 now brings the extinction derived from broad - band photometry into accord with that derived from spectrophotometry .",
    "we were initially concerned about such a large value for @xmath14 , but found that we derive a very similar number using the kurucz ( 1992 ) atlas9 models in place of the marcs models .",
    "we also find a large @xmath14 value when we instead employ the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) reddening law with the marcs models : @xmath25 with a negligible correction for color excess @xmath23 .",
    "the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) law has slightly lower extinction than ccm89 on the short wavelength side of the @xmath1 filter , and on the long wavelength side of the @xmath0 filter ; the latter is primarily responsible for the difference in the derived @xmath14 .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) has emphasized the difficulties encountered in deriving a monochromatic law from broad - band photometry , and derived a reddening curve that was very similar to that of ccm89 ; but for stars of extreme color , such as rsgs , small differences matter . to obtain satisfactory fits to our spectrophotometry using the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) reddening law we found that we needed to decrease the visual extinction by about 0.3  mag compared to",
    "that needed with the ccm89 law .",
    "even so , the ccm89 law ( used in paper i ) resulted in slightly better fits , as shown by the two examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : laws ] .",
    "to answer which reddening law is really  right \" requires careful comparison with spectrophotometry of stars over a wide range of properties .",
    "here we simply note that the 0.3  mag systematic differences obtained between these two laws are comparable to the estimated uncertainties in paper i.",
    "although our spectrophotometry was immune to issues of bandpass shifts , it still supposed that the extinction was due to @xmath3 reddening that characterizes dust in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "that assumption was probably not completely valid , as circumstellar dust may be present in some cases .",
    "we began to consider this possibility when we were struck by the fact that many of the rsgs in ob associations have significantly higher extinction than the average early - type star in the same regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : avcluster ] we show the comparison between the two .",
    "the average @xmath16 for each cluster comes from paper  i , and is based upon a critical inspection of the values listed in humphreys ( 1978 ) , eliminating stars whose spectroscopic parallaxes are significantly ( 1  mag ) deviant from the cluster averages . indeed , this conclusion could have been made by others based purely on those data . of course , many of the ob associations cover a large area of the sky and include a significant range of reddenings , and we indicate the standard deviation by the error bars ( @xmath26 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : avcluster ] .",
    "we find that about 40% of our sample ( 22 out of 56 stars ) shows evidence of extra extinction at the @xmath27 level ; 14% ( 8 out of 56 ) shows @xmath28 excess extinction .    in retrospect , this result should have been long anticipated .",
    "red supergiants are known to be  smoky \" in the sense that dust condenses in the stellar winds .",
    "the presence of the resulting circumstellar dust shells was first revealed by ground - based ir photometry ( see , for example , hyland et al .",
    "1969 ) , while _ iras _ two - color diagrams established that such dust shells are a common phenomenon for rsgs ( stencel et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "this dust is thought to be partially responsible for driving the stellar wind via radiation pressure ( but see the questions raised by macgregor & stencel 1992 ) .",
    "interferometry in the ir has demonstrated that for some rsgs ( such as vy cma ) the dust is found very close to the star itself ( 3 - 5 stellar radii ) , while in other cases it is found at greater distances , suggesting that the production of substantial amounts of dust is episodic in nature , with time scales of a few decades ( danchi et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "josselin et al .  ( 2000 ) use the @xmath29-[12 ] color to determine dust - productions rates @xmath30 , where [ 12 ] is the magnitude based on the iras 12@xmath5 m flux adjusted so that a 10,000 k star would have zero color .",
    "( thus stars with positive @xmath29-[12 ] values have some 12-@xmath5 m excess , as the index has little sensitivity to effective temperature . )",
    "one of the surprising results from that study was that there was little or no correlation of @xmath30 with bolometric luminosity . from first principles",
    "one would expect that mass - loss rates will be dependent upon luminosity , among other factors . however , josselin et al .  adopted the individual spectroscopic parallaxes listed by humphreys ( 1978 ) as the true distances , rather than using the average cluster values .",
    "this is equivalent to adopting a single absolute visual magnitude for all rsgs of a given spectral type and luminosity class , a poor approximation since rsgs span a large range in masses and luminosities .",
    "we revisit this issue here by using the cluster distances adopted in paper  i ( based upon the early - type stars ) , and by revising the @xmath30 values using the larger and more homogeneous @xmath31 dataset of the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "[ fig : eric](a ) shows a more convincing correlation .",
    "the scatter is still large , but in part this may be due to the inclusion of a few unreliable data points : for instance , the two outliers on the left are hd  160371 in m6 , a cluster which contains no early - type members ( humphreys 1978 ) , and bd+56@xmath322793 ( st cep ) in cep  ob2 , which humphreys ( 1978 ) characterizes as a  doubtful member \" of its association . in figs .",
    "[ fig : eric](b ) and ( c ) we show that the extra extinction @xmath33 is correlated with @xmath30 and with @xmath34",
    ".    we can also ask if this amount of extinction is _ reasonable _ given the measured dust production rates .",
    "equation 3.31 from whittet ( 2003 ) provides the link between the mass density of dust @xmath35 and @xmath16 per unit path - length l : @xmath36 , where the density and length are in mks units . a rigorous calculation for dust condensing around rsgs",
    "is complicated by the fact that the dust may be decoupled from the stellar wind gas velocities ( macgregor & stencel 1992 ) and likely occurs episodically ( danchi et al .  1994 ) , and thus the radial distribution of dust throughout the @xmath37 yr lifetime of the rsg phase is not easily known .",
    "however , _ most _ of the extinction will occur in the thin shell near where the dust first condenses , as this is where the mass density will be the highest .",
    "we can therefore get a crude lower - limit to the expected amount of extinction by assuming a thin - shell approximation : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radius ( meters ) where the dust condenses , @xmath40 is the mass ( kg ) of the dust , and the shell thickness @xmath41 is substituted for the path length @xmath42 , which cancels with @xmath41 in the denominator . for 10 yrs of dust production ( a typical time scale for episodic dust formation according to danchi et al 1994 ) at a rate of @xmath43 yr@xmath7 , we would expect a mass of @xmath44 kg to be deposited in this thin shell , and thus we would have @xmath45 mag , where we have adopted a radius @xmath39 of @xmath46 ( i.e. , 10 stellar radii ) .",
    "dust produced over a longer period of time , or which condenses at a smaller radii , will increase this  minimum reasonable value \" , while a lower dust production rate , or a larger @xmath39 , will reduce the value .",
    "this exercise suggests that for the lower luminosity rsgs , @xmath33 would be a few tenths of a mag or less ( and hence not detectable ) , while the most extreme rsgs might have @xmath33 values of several magnitudes  just what we find .",
    "sufficient dust to cause several mags of visual extinction might make its presence known in ways other than the ir excess discussed above .",
    "r coronae borealis stars , whose extreme variability is known to be due to circumstellar dust , show a uv - excess ( hecht et al .  1984 , 1998 ) .",
    "in part , such  fresh \" dust may start with a distribution skewed to larger particle sizes ( which would lead to less uv and nuv extinction ) before being broken down and assimilated into the interstellar medium ( see also jura 1996 and whittet 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , preferential scattering of blue light into the beam by the parts of the unresolved circumstellar dust shell that are off - axis to the line of sight may be enough to explain the larger observed fluxes in the uv and near - uv regions .    indeed , as we reported in paper i , the marcs models reddened with an @xmath3 ccm89 law showed this sort of nuv mismatch with the observed spectral energy distributions for the most heavily reddened stars ( which were also the ones with the highest excess reddening ) .",
    "however , we could not completely rule out an observational explanation for the discrepancy , given that even a small amount of red light scattered within the instrument could contaminate the low fluxes in the nuv without such problems showing up in the spectrophotometric standards .",
    "for the most reddened m supergiants in our sample , @xmath47 is 10,000 , while this ratio is near unity for standards .",
    "on ut 2005 april 21 we obtained new data in the blue ( 3500 - 5800 ) on a subsample of 11 stars from paper i using the kitt peak 2.1-m telescope with the goldcam spectrometer .",
    "the observational parameters are the same as given in table  3 of paper  i _ except _ that a cuso@xmath48 filter was employed to eliminate any possibility of contamination of the nuv region by red light .",
    "the observational and reduction procedures were the same as given in paper  i. the new spectra agreed well with the old data in general , although turns - ups in the blue for the two reddest stars are now eliminated , suggesting that instrument effects could indeed have been a problem with some of those data .",
    "we therefore restrict our discussion only to the new data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv](a ) and ( b ) we show the match between the models reddened by the standard ccm89 @xmath3 law and the observed spectra for two of the stars in our sample .",
    "ky  cyg has the the highest excess reddening ( @xmath49  mag ) , and is among the most luminous star in our sample ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in the nuv is striking .",
    "by contrast , the agreement in the nuv region is very good for the star hd  216946 , a star with no excess reddening ( @xmath51 ) and modest luminosity ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we can quantify this by computing an nuv index where we compare the integrated flux from 3500 to 3900   of the reddened model to that of the star , expressed as a difference in magnitudes . in the other panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv ] we show that the size of the nuv discrepancy is well correlated with the amount of extra extinction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv]_c _ ) , the dust production rate @xmath30 as measured from the 12-@xmath5 m excess ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv]_d _ ) , and the bolometric luminosity of the star computed from the k - band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv]_e _ ) .",
    "there are certainly other explanations for the nuv discrepancy .",
    "the spectra of some stars could be contaminated by the presence of a hot companion .",
    "however , we would expect such stars to show a composite spectrum .",
    "indeed , in paper  i we had eliminated several stars from our sample because balmer lines were clearly present .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that hot spots might be present on the surface of these stars , as suggested by interferometric observations and uv _ hst _ imaging ; see freytag ( 2003 ) and references therein .",
    "stars with vigorous convection patterns could have spectra dominated by regions at different temperatures depending upon the wavelength . alternatively",
    ", chromospheric emission may play a role ( carpenter et al .",
    "1994 , harper et al .",
    "these possibilities could , and should , be investigated by higher spectral resolution studies .",
    "nevertheless , the correlations shown in fig .  [ fig : nuv ] provide strong evidence that circumstellar dust is the culprit .",
    "although it is tempting to derive the reddening law of this circumstellar material , it is difficult to accurately extract the circumstellar component from the total extinction , given the high ( and uncertain ) amount of foreground reddening .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining the necessary data for a large sample of rsgs in the magellanic clouds .",
    "there the problem is actually tractable , given the small and relatively uniform extinction of the clouds ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "in reviews of the origin of cosmic dust , the role of rsgs is often ignored , with the primary sources given as sne and low - mass agb stars . however , for dusty galaxies at large look - back times , agbs can not play a role given the time scales for low - mass stellar evolution . when high - mass stars are discussed , it is usually only the wc - type wolf - rayet stars that are considered ( see , for example , dwek 1998 ) .",
    "however , only the late - type wcs are known to produce dust , and even those types may require a binary companion ( see crowther 2003 ) . in the milky way ,",
    "late - type wcs are concentrated towards the galactic center , and are known to be absent in low - metallicity galaxies ( see massey 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "so , in extreme environments ( such as metal - poor starbursts , or for most galaxies at early times ) , rsgs could play a dominant role .    here",
    "we briefly consider how large that role is locally .",
    "we expect the production rate ( in units of mass per unit time per unit area of the galactic disk ) to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the surface density of rsgs as a function of mass and @xmath55 is the dust production rate .",
    "we can estimate these quantities as follows .",
    "first , from fig .",
    "[ fig : eric](a ) , we find that @xmath56 for @xmath57 , which roughly corresponds to masses @xmath58 .",
    "in paper  i we used the evolutionary tracks of meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) to estimate that the masses of rsgs scale with luminosity as @xmath59 , so we expect @xmath60 for rsgs with masses @xmath61 .",
    "the surface density @xmath54 is harder to estimate .",
    "we expect @xmath62 , where we have assumed a salpeter initial mass function , and @xmath63 is the lifetime of the rsg phase as a function of mass . from the evolutionary models of meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) , we find that the rsg phase lasts 2  myr ( 10@xmath64 ) to 0.4  myr ( 25@xmath64 ) , and we use the models to approximate @xmath65 .",
    "jura & kleinmann ( 1990 ) find 21 _ high - luminosity _",
    "( @xmath66 , corresponding roughly to 19@xmath64 ) rsgs within 2.5 kpc of the sun , or a surface density of 1 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "if that is complete ( and we list a comparable number , 18 , meeting these criteria in our admittedly incomplete sample from paper  i ) , then we can use that to determine the scaling factor @xmath67 : @xmath68 , or @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath70 . substituting in the above",
    ", we expect @xmath71 or @xmath72 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "we emphasize that this value is uncertain due primarily to our poor understanding of the exact completeness limits .",
    "we can instead derive the surface density of rsgs using what we do know about the surface densities of other types of massive stars in the solar neighborhood , appealing to the evolutionary models to then connect the two .",
    "although the number of o - type stars within a few kpc of the sun is poorly known ( see massey 2003 ) , the number of wc - type wolf - rayet stars _ is _ thought to be complete , given their strong emission - line signature ( massey & johnson 1998 ) . according to the evolutionary models of meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) , wcs come from stars with masses greater than 40@xmath64 ; the lifetime of the wc stage is independent of mass , with @xmath73 myr ( see their fig .  10 ) .",
    "the surface density of wcs in the solar neighborhood is 2.1 kpc@xmath7 , a number which we believe _ is _ based on a complete sample ( massey 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "so , @xmath74 , and we derive @xmath75 , about a factor of 6 times greater .",
    "thus @xmath76 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "given the uncertainties ( both in our knowledge of the local rsg content , and in the models ) we consider this agreement very good , and adopt a value @xmath77 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "for comparison whittet ( 2003 ) estimates a return rate for rsgs that is about 3 time greater , well within the uncertainties of our approximation .",
    "this is about 1% of the rate of return of agbs .",
    "how does this compare to the production rate for wc - type wrs ? as stated above , only the late - type wcs ( wcls ) are known to produce dust , and even those may require a binary companion . from conti & vacca ( 1990 )",
    "we find a surface density of wcls of 0.5 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "the ( total ) mass - loss rates of wcs are about independent of mass , and are about @xmath78 yr@xmath7 ( nugis & lammers 2000 ) . of this ,",
    "perhaps 2% is dust ( dwek 1998 ) .",
    "so we expect @xmath79 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "if close binarity is a requirement for dust ejection , then this value should be decreased by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "we adopt a compromise of @xmath80 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 , or about a factor of 3 higher than @xmath81 . in low - metallicity systems ( or the outwards of the solar circle in the milky way ) there are no late - type wcs , and rsgs will dominate the dust production by massive stars . in star - bursts , where stars are recently formed",
    ", most dust production should be by rsgs , as low - mass stars will not have had sufficient time to evolve to agbs .",
