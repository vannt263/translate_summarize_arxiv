    "since the pioneering work of su , schrieffer and heeger ( ssh ) @xcite , the ssh model has been widely used to investigate the properties of conducting polymers , especially polyacetylene [ ( ch)@xmath0 @xcite . at half - filling , this system , as many quasi - one - dimensional materials , exhibits an instability against a periodic lattice distortion due to the peierls dynamics . because of a twofold degenerate ground state",
    ", this system allows for the soliton excitation with an associated electronic state at the center of the energy gap @xcite .",
    "while considerable effort has been made to understand excitation energies of solitons and polarons in these compounds , it is theoretically and experimentally significant to develop an accepted theory for their optical absorption spectrum .",
    "the recent exploitations of this model in studying the properties of nanotubes @xcite renew further interesting of theoretical studies on the intrinsic physics of this model . in the previous works on conducting polymers , along with the expanding of measurements",
    ", theoretical attempts have been made to study the energy gap @xcite , low - lying excitation @xcite , and optical response @xcite of this system . however , there exist discrepancies between theories and experiments .",
    "( i ) within the adiabatic approximation , the calculated optical absorption coefficient of the perfectly dimerized lattice has an inverse - square - root edge singularity at @xmath1 and there is no absorption inside the gap .",
    "but the observed optical absorption spectrum of polyacetylene is quite different @xcite .",
    "the singularity is absent , and there is a significant tail below the maximum .",
    "( ii ) the energy gap deduced from the absorption edge is smaller than the activation energy of the dc conductivity @xcite .",
    "in ( ch)@xmath2 the zero - point motion of the lattice @xmath3 ( = 0.03 ra12 ) is comparable to the amplitude of the lattice peierls distortion @xmath4 ( = 0.03 @xcite or 0.035 @xcite ) . although it has been stated that the quantum lattice fluctuations cause a slightly small reduction of the dimerization order parameter @xcite , if @xmath5 , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , one might wonder why there should be a clearly defined gap in the spectrum at all and expect the optical absorption spectrum to peak at the correspondingly renormalized gap edge . in nonadiabatic case ,",
    "the phonon frequency @xmath6 is finite . generally speaking",
    ", the nonadiabatic effect will suppress the state order parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "as the density - of - states ( dos ) of electrons is concerned , the results of adiabatic approximations also have inverse - square - root singularity at the gap edge .",
    "by considering the nonadiabatic effect , the singularity may disappear @xcite .",
    "the influence of the phonon frequency on dos , the optical - absorption spectrum , and other order parameters in the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 should be studied for understanding the physics of electron - phonon interactions in nonadiabatic case .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the coupled electron - phonon system for all values of the ionic mass and the electron - phonon coupling constant is a very difficult problem , especially when the quantum lattice fluctuation and the lattice dynamic ( quantum phonon ) effects are taken into account .",
    "this problem has been investigated by using the monte carlo simulation ra15,ra16 , perturbation calculation @xcite , greens - function technique @xcite , renormalization group analysis @xcite , variational method of the squeezed - polaron wave - function @xcite , etc . in a resent work @xcite ,",
    "this problem was studied by considering the spinless holstein model and obtained some interesting results . in this paper , by considering ssh model , the more realistic case with spin-@xmath9 electrons , we focus on the properties of the effects of quantum lattice fluctuations on the dimerization energy gap and the optical - responses of the system with the view of understanding the measurement evidences and of interpreting why and how the dimerization energy gap is smaller than the optical absorption gap .",
    "our analyses show that at finite phonon frequency , the peak position of optical absorption spectrum is not directly corresponding to the dimerized gap .",
    "the dimerization gap is much more reduced by the quantum lattice fluctuations than the optical absorption coefficient is .",
    "the effects of quantum lattice fluctuations on the dimerization gap and on the optical gap are essentially different , especially when phonon frequency @xmath6 is small .",
    "the reason for this is discussed and the relationship between the peak position of optical absorption spectrum and the true dimerization gap is obtained quantitatively .",
    "we start from the ssh model @xcite @xmath10(c_{l , s}^{\\dag } c_{l+1,s}+c_{l+1,s}^{\\dag } c_{l , s})+\\sum_{l}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2m}p_{l}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}k(u_{l}-u_{l+1})^{2}\\right ] .",

    "the phonon frequency @xmath20 and the coupling function @xmath21.\\ ] ] in the ssh model , the electron couples to the difference between the phonon amplitudes on the two neighboring sites and the form of the lattice vibration energy leads the phonons to be dispersive .    among the models for one - dimensional systems the holstein model @xcite and ssh model are the two typical electron - phonon coupling hamiltonian studied by many previous authors .",
    "the holstein model is for the on - site electron - phonon interaction with dispersionless phonons coupled with electron density operator and has played a central role in the polaron problem , while the ssh model is for the on - bond electron - phonon interaction and has been successful in describing the essential physics of conducting polymers .",
    "phonon dispersion and different structures of the coupling terms lead to important differences in the physics of the two models . for the holstein model , although numerical simulation @xcite has been performed in confirmation of the supposition that it is likely the peierls gap is more reduced by the quantum lattice fluctuations than the dimerization or the charge - density - wave amplitude , in other words , the quantum lattice fluctuations have a much strong effect on the peierls gap than on the amplitude of the peierls distortion , due to the difficulty in preparing practicably pure sample of molecular crystal materials , few of observation data are available for the comparison with theoretical results .",
    "other models somewhat intermediate between the ssh and holstein models , such as the model for @xmath22 chain materials @xcite and the model for electron - libron coupling in polyaniline @xcite , because of their complex forms with coulomb interactions and steric potential accounting for the ring torsion angle , will make the presentation of our analysis to be more prolix and inexplicit .",
    "the enormous measurement data of optical absorption spectrum in conducting polymers and the relatively simple form of ssh model render it the favorable system for our investigation into the nonadiabatic effect on the dimerization gap and the optical absorption spectrum of the electron - phonon coupling systems .",
    "the previous researches on this problem in ssh model by using a static gaussian - random potential method to model the lattice disorder field @xcite and a configurational - coordinate method to treat the anharmonic lattice fluctuations @xcite were phenomenological theories and have not obtained the true peierls dimerization gap .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to develop an nonadiabatic approach to study analytically this problem simply from the model hamiltonian .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling and the peierls dimerization are two main respects in our studying on the ssh model .",
    "first , in order to take into account the electron - phonon coupling , an unitary transformation is applied to @xmath16 , @xmath23 where the generator @xmath24 is @xmath25 here , we introduce a function @xmath26 which is a function of the energies of incoming and outgoing electrons in the electron - phonon scattering process and it s form will be determined later .",

    "contrary to the statement mentioned in the beginning that the quantum lattice fluctuations cause a slightly small reduction of the dimerization order parameter ra15,ra16,ra17 , our analysis shows that the dimerization gap being much more reduced behaves very different from other order parameters .",
