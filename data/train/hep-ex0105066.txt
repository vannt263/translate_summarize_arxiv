    "wire chambers with cathode strip readout ( ces ) are located at shower maximum in the central electromagnetic calorimeter .",

    "a variable bin - width has been chosen to correspond to two times the mass resolution ( 2@xmath70 ) to enable the observation of narrow structures .",
    "the dominant backgrounds for this analysis are @xmath71jet and jet - jet production , where the jets have ` faked ' photons by fluctuating to a single @xmath16  or @xmath72 , and real photon pairs from prompt qcd production .",

    "this corresponds to a background fraction of @xmath77 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "the systematic uncertainty comes primarily from uncertainties in the modeling of the back - scattering of photons from the electro - magnetic shower in the calorimeter into the cpr chambers , and the modeling of the shower shapes in the ces chambers .",

    "the @xmath73  events are selected with very loose requirements to minimize any bias in the method .",
    "a global systematic uncertainty of @xmath84  applies to these estimates , coming from the uncertainty on the correction factor ( 10% ) , the modeling of qed radiation ( 10% for diphoton masses below 120 gev / c@xmath14  and 5% above ) , the dependence on the structure functions ( 5% ) , and the integrated luminosity ( 4% ) .",
