    "we would like to thank andreas vogt , for useful discussions regarding nnlo splitting functions .",
    "rst would like to thank the royal society for the award of a university research fellowship .",

    "we use a very similar charm prescription to that adopted in @xcite , which is a generalization of the thorne - roberts variable - flavour - number scheme ( vfns ) @xcite to nnlo . as explained in @xcite , this has to be a _ model _ , since the nnlo fixed - flavour - number scheme ( ffns ) coefficients are not known . in principle",
    "we should be more sophisticated and ( i ) use a correct matching procedure for the nnlo vfns coefficient function ( possible at present ) , ( ii ) take into account the small discontinuity of the charm parton distribution at nnlo ( also possible at present ) , and ( iii ) also take in account the effect of the nnlo ffns coefficient function ( not possible at present ) .",
    "since the full nnlo prescription is missing , and since the nnlo splitting functions are approximate themselves at present , we adopt a simple procedure at nnlo . in @xcite",
    "we just used the massless @xmath46 gluon coefficient function multiplied by the velocity of the heavy quark @xmath47 , which has the correct threshold behaviour but @xmath48 at high @xmath14 , as the nnlo coefficient function at all @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "this has the shortcoming that it leads to a ( small ) negative contribution at low @xmath14 and small @xmath8 since the the massless @xmath46 gluon coefficient function is negative at small @xmath8 , whereas we would expect the nnlo ffns contribution to actually be positive in this region .",
    "indeed the low @xmath8 , low @xmath14 charm data are underestimated using our procedure . hence in this paper",
    "we adopt the minimal simple modification and weight by @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 , so that this negative contribution is minimized .",
    "this improves both the fit to charm data and the global fit .",
    "this simple approach seems to us to be sufficient at the present level of theoretical accuracy .",
    "once the splitting functions are known exactly at nnlo we should improve our nnlo charm model . in principle one can even produce an approximate nnlo ffns coefficient function from the known small @xmath8 limit @xcite and known threshold logarithms @xcite .      c. anastasiou , e.w.n .",

    "<S> recently much effort has been invested in computing nnlo qcd corrections to a wide variety of partonic processes @xcite and therefore we need to generate parton distributions also at nnlo so that the theory can be applied in a consistent manner . analyzing dis at nnlo is important in itself in that we may be able to investigate the hierarchy lo @xmath7 nlo @xmath7 nnlo in the process where there are perhaps the most precise data . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been a significant increase in the precision of the structure function data from the hera experiments @xcite@xcite and these , together with the inclusive jet production measurements at the tevatron @xcite , were used to generate an updated version of the nlo partons @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> valuable partial information is known in the form of the few lowest moments of the splitting functions @xcite , which tightly constrain the large @xmath8 behaviour . when this is combined with the known most singular @xmath9 behaviour @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it greatly limits the possible behaviour of the functions down to quite small values of @xmath8 . indeed , van neerven and vogt @xcite constructed a range of compact analytic expressions for the splitting functions that are all compatible with this information . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they provided closed expressions which represent the fastest and the slowest permissible evolution . in an exploratory nnlo global analysis of the data @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we , in turn , used these expressions to obtain bands representing the spread of allowed parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the range of uncertainty of the nnlo gluon distribution was found to be about @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) at @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the moment calculation of the three - loop splitting functions was extended to give two higher moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed van neerven and vogt @xcite to provide analytic expressions for the nnlo splitting functions which considerably increase the reliability of the evolution in the region @xmath13 . in other words , the allowed bands of permissible splitting functions </S>",
    "<S> has shrunk considerably , even , somewhat surprisingly , at small @xmath8 . ; </S>",
    "<S> i.e. the bands should not be regarded as anything like one - sigma errors in a gaussian distribution . ] the splitting functions are located near the ` slow evolution ' edge of their previous bands .    here , we use these improved constraints on the splitting functions to perform a new nnlo global parton analysis of the available data sets , which include the new more precise structure function measurements from hera @xcite@xcite and the inclusive jet data from the tevatron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis uses the same form of the starting parameterizations and the same data sets @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite , with the same @xmath14 and @xmath15 cuts , as our recent nlo global analysis @xcite . in particular , we fit to dis data with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .. the results are similar to nlo , and will be reported in @xcite . ] in going to a nnlo analysis , we use the three - loop expression for @xmath18 , in the @xmath19 scheme , and we extend the matching conditions when evolving through the heavy quark thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the heavy quark prescription are very similar to those in @xcite , but we add a brief discussion of important points in the appendix . although the deep inelastic data are described at nnlo , some other processes are not yet calculated to this accuracy , and so we have to use nlo expressions to fit to the data for ( i ) tevatron jet production , ( ii ) the charged lepton rapidity asymmetry from @xmath20 boson hadroproduction and ( iii ) the drell - yan process that we use in the analysis . ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the effect of the threshold corrections at nnlo to tevatron jet production has been calculated in @xcite , and this reduces scale uncertainty and perhaps is a good approximation to the full nnlo correction . </S>",
    "<S> the result is approximately a @xmath21 increase in normalization of the theory prediction ( not surprising since the nlo correction is itself about a @xmath22 raise , largely independent of @xmath0 ) , which would be completely subsumed in the normalization error of the data .    </S>",

    "<S> these ` slow ' and ` fast ' evolutions we denote by a and b respectively .    for the sake of studying the progression from lo through nlo to nnlo , we also perform a pure lo fit , for which the starting parameterization is @xmath31 with @xmath32 in this case @xmath33 ( again see table  1 ) , and the parameterization of the gluon is simpler because the fit no longer requires a negative input gluon at small @xmath8 at this order .    </S>",
    "<S> .the qcd coupling , and corresponding @xmath34 parameter for @xmath35 ( in the @xmath36 scheme with @xmath37 in all cases ) , for the lo , nlo and nnlo fits . </S>",
    "<S> note that as we progress from order to order a very different value of @xmath38 is needed to give the same @xmath39 , that is @xmath40 is defined differently at different orders . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , we have have carried out nnlo and lo global analyses of data which include the most recent data on dis from hera together with constraints from hard scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons were made with our recent nlo analysis @xcite for the the structure functions and for the partons themselves . </S>",
    "<S> there is improvement in the general quality of the description of the data as one goes to higher orders , though the improvement in the global fit at nnlo is not as great as one might expect , and there is also the surprising result that the lo partons give an excellent fit to the tevatron high-@xmath0 jet data . </S>",
    "<S> the partons at nnlo change by up to @xmath41 for @xmath42 compared to those at nlo , with the largest change being in the gluon , which decreases for @xmath8 less than about @xmath43 but increases for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the quarks increase for @xmath3 at low @xmath14 due to the negative gluon coefficient function , but decrease at lower @xmath8 for higher @xmath14 because of the slower evolution due to the smaller gluon </S>",
    "<S> . they also decrease at very high @xmath8 due to the positive effect of the nnlo coefficient function .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that these are the first generally available sets of partons at nnlo and should add impetus to the large activity presently under way to compute nnlo corrections to a variety of hard processes . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the computation of the ` missing ' nnlo coefficient functions for the differential drell - yan and large-@xmath0 jet cross sections used in the global fit to constrain the large-@xmath8 sea and gluon distributions respectively is now a matter of some urgency . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo partons discussed ini this paper can be found at http://durpdg.dur.ac.uk/hepdata/mrs together with the recent nlo partons ( @xmath45 scheme ) from a similar analysis @xcite . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> we have also added the nlo partons for mrst2001 in the dis scheme and the lo partons discussed in this paper . </S>"
