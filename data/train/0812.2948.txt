    "from a sufficiently close perspective , understanding the effect of chirality on the organization high - aspect ratio molecules appears to be problem of local geometry .",
    "the lack of mirror symmetry generically implies that rod - like molecules exert a mutual torque , favoring a preferred tilt of neighboring molecules as opposed to a parallel arrangement of molecular axes favored in achiral systems  @xcite .",
    "it is this vantage point that originally compelled crick to propose the so - called  coiled - coil \" model to explain the structure of @xmath0-karetin from x - ray diffraction data  @xcite .",
    "but it is well - known that chiral forces , while local in nature , have profound implications for the global arrangement of molecules in ordered systems .",
    "a fascinating example of this global influence occurs in the  blue phases \" of liquid - crystals , wherein mesoscopic chiral order is delicately maintained by a periodic network of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "a more explicit example of this effect was noted by de gennes for chiral liquid crystals with smectic order  @xcite . just as the application of magnetic field destroys the superconducting state ,",
    "the tendency for chiral , or cholesteric , ordering disrupts the ability to form a periodic stack of layers .",
    "at best , chiral order exists in a smectic system in the neighborhood of screw - dislocation grain boundaries , where periodic order has locally been destroyed  @xcite .    beyond the one - dimensional case of smectic materials ,",
    "chiral - tilt order is more generally incompatible with bulk periodic order .",
    "indeed , it routinely observed that bulk systems of chiral polymers  such as dna fragments  expel twist above a critical concentration at which they adopt _ two - dimensional _ , columnar , liquid - crystalline order  @xcite . for hexagonally - ordered chiral polymers , tilt order that reflects that chirality is only possible in the presence dislocation grain boundaries that locally tear the underlying two - dimensional lattice  @xcite .",
    "that columnar phases have this property in common with smectic phases is not a surprise , as the array of two - dimensionally ordered lines can be decomposed into layers , each of which is incompatible with a global twist .",
    "while global chiral ordering is not possible for a _ bulk _ periodic system , the same may not be said for a _",
    "finite _ domain .",
    "this fact is well - appreciated in the context chiral membranes  @xcite , since ribbon of finite width may be twisted into a helicoid without tearing .",
    "hence , the material is globally ordered in a chiral sense , while at the same time maintaining the inherent layer geometry .",
    "in a recent letter  @xcite , we reported on a similar mechanism in which molecular chirality induces a global twist of a two - dimensional assembly of filaments , provided that the assembly is _",

    "the chiral ordering of filamentous assemblies has profound implications , with particular consequences for systems of biological filaments , such as dna or filamentous proteins .",
    "namely , global twisting of bundles can ultimately limit the stable size bundle aggregates , providing a generic and robust means by which cells may regulate the assembly of a host of biological filaments into fiber bundles .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to present and analyze a general model of filament assembly in which molecular chirality frustrates the ability to form two - dimensionally ordered aggregates , ultimately leading to a state of thermodynamically stable bundle assemblies of finite diameter .    in this article , we explore two geometrically distinct mechanisms through which chirality at the molecular scale frustrates the two - dimensional assembly of filaments . in the first mechanism , chirality is a colligative effect , favoring a difference in backbone orientation when two filaments are brought into close contact .",

    ", we present a more detailed analysis of the model of twisted , straight bundles .",
    "we find that the optimal degree of bundle twist is a generically non - mononotonic function of bundle radius , with a single maximum whose location is determined only by the mechanical resistance of the bundle to twist . in the simplest case , that of a hexagonal - columnar , liquid - crystalline bundle , this characteristic size is the bend penetration depth , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the respective elastic constants describing the resistance to bending and in - plane shear distortions of the hexagonal filament packing .",
    "the predicted non - monotonic dependence optimal twist on bundle radius is critically linked to appearance of an optimal bundle radius , which is in the range of the characteristically mesoscopic length scale , @xmath4 .",
    "we find that a dispersed state of finite - sized bundles is predicted to be stable for systems near to , but below , the point of bulk condensation , in which aggregate size is thermodynamically unlimited .",
    "in addition to the case of twisted bundle , here we explore a novel mechanism in which molecular chiral structure obstructs the ability to form two - dimensional filament assemblies . in this second mechanism",

    "we consider the case of _ isometric packings _ of filament recently analyzed in detail by starostin , in which the bundle maintains a perfectly hexagonal arrangement perpendicular the filament backbone  @xcite .",
    "while these bundles are optimal in terms of constant preferred distance between neighboring filaments , growing a bundle to finite radius requires filaments at the periphery of the to be distorted from their preferred state of writhe .",
    "thus , we find that the preferred geometry of filaments _ also _ frustrates the growth of hexagonally - packed bundles of helical filaments .",
    "although this second mechanism is quite distinction from the case where filaments twist around a straight bundle axis ",

    "the point of bulk condensation , bundles of filaments grow to finite diameter . as the bundle grows ,",
    "the bundle unwinds , straightening out the helical filaments .",
    "as such , we find that the range of thermodynamic stability of finite - sized helical bundles is sensitive only to the mechanical cost of unbending the filament from its preferred state .",

    "<S> we explore two distinct mechanisms by which chirality at the molecular scale of the filament frustrates the assembly into aggregates . in the first , chiral interactions between filaments impart an overall twisting of filaments around the central axis of the bundle . in the second </S>",
    "<S> , we consider filaments that are inherently helical in structure , imparting a writhing geometry to the central axis . for both mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a thermodynamically - stable state of dispersed bundles of _ finite _ width appears close to , but below , the point of bulk filament condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the range of thermodynamic stability of dispersed bundles is sensitive only to the elastic cost and preference for chiral filament packing . </S>",
    "<S> the self - limited assembly of chiral filaments has particular implications for a large class of biological molecules  dna , filamentous proteins , viruses , bacterial flagella  which are universally chiral and are observed to form compact bundles under a broad range of conditions . </S>"
