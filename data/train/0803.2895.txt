    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an excellent description of all particle physics interactions , excluding gravity .",
    "the excellent agreement of the sm predictions with the measured precision electroweak ( ew ) physics observables would be recovered in any extension of the sm in which the new physics decouples fast from physics at the weak scale .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an example of such an extension .",
    "supersymmetric particles receive contribution to their masses through gauge invariant operators which are independent of the higgs mechanism , and their effects decouple fast as these masses are increased .",
    "since these contributions to the slepton and squark masses are not necessarily alligned in flavor space with the lepton and quark masses , new flavor violating contributions become significant , leading to a potential conflict with flavor physics observables .    in gauge",
    "mediated susy breaking models , susy breaking masses are flavor independent at the messenger scale , leading to flavor violating effects that are still controlled by the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , enabling the existence of superparticles with ew scale masses .",
    "problems remain in the higgs sector , however , related to the origin and natural relation between the higgsino mass parameter @xmath10 and the higgs mixing mass term @xmath11 .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) , we need a term of the form @xmath12 to give the higgsinos a mass . if @xmath13 , the higgs scalars in the chiral superfields obtain a large mass term in the potential and the ew symmetry may not be broken . if @xmath14 , the lightest chargino mass is lighter than @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the soft mass of bino and winos , and the experimental bounds can not be satisfied",
    ". therefore we must have @xmath17 however , it is hard to understand why the @xmath10 parameter is of this scale instead of the more fundamental planck scale @xmath18 , considering that it is not related in any direct way to the susy breaking sector of the mssm . introducing a dynamical mechanism may help solve this so - called @xmath10 problem , but generally at the price of introducing some new problems , e.g. , @xmath0 problem .",
    "the @xmath0 problem is related to the origin of the scalar soft susy breaking higgs mixing mass term , @xmath19 to stabilize the ew scale @xmath20 , it is necessary to have @xmath21 in the context of a dynamical generation of @xmath10 , however , it is difficult to generate a @xmath11 satisfying this relation .",
    "this is particularly true for the case of low - scale gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "so far , there are three main mechanisms to solve the @xmath0 problem .",
    "the first one is the giudice - masiero mechanism which is the first proposed to solve this problem in the context of gravity - mediated susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "its basic idea is to assume an exact peccei - quinn symmetry , forbidding the @xmath10 term in the supersymmetric limit , and then generate it and @xmath22 dynamically according to the susy breaking effects of the same order .",
    "explicitly , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduce one set of higher - dimensional operators in the kahler potential @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the susy breaking chiral spurion .",
    "once the susy is broken , the effective @xmath10 and @xmath22 parameters are generated as @xmath25 since @xmath26 denotes the natural scale of the soft terms in the gravity - mediation case , the correct relationship @xmath27 arises if @xmath28 .",
    "but this idea is hard to be translated to the gauge - mediation case . in the effective theory of gauge - mediation , the @xmath10 and @xmath22 operators ( similar to those in eq.([105 ] ) ) are generally induced at the same loop - level . unlike the gravity - mediation case , the effective susy breaking scale @xmath29 is no longer the natural scale of the soft terms , which necessarily leads to a modified relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath22 @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the messenger scale ( unlike the gravity - mediation , @xmath32 and @xmath33 now represent the product of coupling constants and possible loop factors ) .",
    "recently , it was noticed  @xcite that the @xmath22 operator in eq.([105 ] ) is not protected by non - renormalization theorems of the hidden sector because @xmath34 is not a holomorphic or anti - holomorphic operator of the hidden sector .",
    "the strong dynamics in the hidden sector therefore can efficiently suppress @xmath33 with respect to @xmath32 , in the renormalization group(rg ) evolution above the susy breaking scale @xmath35 .",
    "however , due to the same effect , the characteristic mass spectrum of gauge mediation in the squark and slepton sectors is ruined in this model .",
    "it turns out that the physically allowed parameter region for this model is rather small  @xcite .",
    "a second one is the dynamical relaxation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "its basic idea is to generate @xmath10 and @xmath22 according to the susy breaking effects of different orders .",
    "explicitly , one can forbid the appearance of non - holomorphic operators and hence a @xmath22 operator in the effective action of one - loop level .",
    "then the operators from the higher - order corrections can be responsible of generating @xmath22 of the correct size .",
    "such an one - loop effective action has the general form  @xcite @xmath36 + h.c . \\label{109}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 being the supersymmetric covariant derivative and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 being generic functions of susy breaking chiral spurion @xmath24 .",
    "these one - loop effective operators can be induced by a proper construction of the superpotential in the messenger sector .",
    "the effective @xmath10 term then arise according to the second term  @xcite or the third one  @xcite which are characterized by a divergent logarithmic form of @xmath41 in this mechanism . as for the @xmath22 term",
    ", it will be generated at a higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "this mechanism is similar to that of the soft mass generation of squarks and sleptons .",
    "but , compared to the naturalness of the latter due to the absence of couplings between the squarks , sleptons and the messenger sector at tree level , the structure of the required superpotential for the former is typically non - generic .",
    "actually , a new dimensional parameter is introduced again in the superpotential of the messenger sector  @xcite .",
    "the third one is the light singlet mechanism which is also the focus of this paper . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath10 term is forbidden by some discrete symmetries ( e.g. , in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and the nearly - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) ) or by some additional abelian gauge symmetry ( e.g. , in the @xmath42-extended minimal supersymmetric standard model ( umssm )  @xcite ) . with the introduction of a singlet chiral superfield @xmath43 in the observable sector which has the coupling @xmath44",
    "the effective @xmath10 and @xmath22 parameters arise as @xmath45 after the susy is broken .",
    "so , as long as the scalar @xmath46 and its auxiliary field @xmath47 are stabilized at the soft susy breaking scale or ew scale , a correct relationship @xmath48 can be achieved . but",
    "this mechanism faces serious problems : ( 1 ) to generate a proper @xmath49 , a negative enough soft mass square @xmath4 is required , which turns out to be a rather difficult mission , persisting for any messenger scale  @xcite ; ( 2 ) both the trilinear soft parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are generically small , compared to @xmath52 ( this is due to the fact that they are highly suppressed at the messenger scale while their rg evolutions down to the ew scale are mediated by small beta functions . ) .",
    "since they are the only sources explicitly breaking the global @xmath7 symmetry , their smallness necessarily leads to a light pseudoscalar which , unless is mainly a singlet , is ruled out by the current lep bound  @xcite .",
    "one way to circumvent these difficulties is to make the @xmath43 field couple to the messengers  @xcite(also see @xcite ) , or to extra light freedom degrees  @xcite .",
    "then a modified boundary value ( at the messenger scale ) or beta function of @xmath53 may help solve this problem .",
    "but , it was realized recently that the experimental bounds on the higgs mass can add severe constraints on the former class of models  @xcite .",
    "as for the latter , it is viable , except that the couplings generally need to be strong @xmath54 if only small number of the light freedom degrees exist  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", however , we will show that the problems in the light singlet mechanism are just some misguided images . in the context of a more general gauge - mediated nmssm where the ( minimal ) messenger pairs @xmath1 and @xmath2 couple to different susy breaking chiral spurions in the hidden sector , there is no difficulty in generating a negative enough @xmath4 in most of the perturbative ( up to gut scale ) @xmath55 parameter region .",
    "the ew scale is then stabilized , and phenomenologically interesting mass spectra of particles and superparticles are also obtained . as a general feature ,",
    "squarks and sleptons become heavy , while there are light charginos and neutralinos , which are mostly an admixture of higgsinos and singlinos .",
    "such an interesting gauge - mediation structure can effectively arise in many general backgrounds .",
    "in addition , there is no light @xmath7 pseudoscalar problem in our model . for the intermediate- and high - scale gauge mediations , large @xmath50 comparable with @xmath52 are typical , so the lightest higgs pseudoscalar actually are not light . for the low - scale case ,",
    "even though @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not always large , the lightest higgs pseudoscalar is extremely singlet - like due to large @xmath5 values , escaping the experimental constraints again .",
    "the light singlet mechanism therefore is naturally implemented , without introducing any complicated or special elements in the messenger sector .",
    "our idea is proposed in section 2 , and followed are the numerical results in section 3 .",
    "the last section is our discussions and conclusions . since",
    "different energy scales are involved for the parameters in this paper , we will specify them unless they can be understood according to the context .",
    "as the simplest extension of the mssm , the nmssm has a superpotential for the higgs superfields @xmath57 where the @xmath10 term in the mssm has been forbidden by a @xmath58 discrete symmetry .",
    "the cubic term of @xmath43 in the superpotential explicitly breaks the peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath59 in the absence of the singlet cubic term the ew symmetry breaking would spontaneously break the peccei - quinn symmetry as well , and hence lead to a dangerous peccei - quinn goldstone boson .",
    "it is not hard to write down the tree - level neutral higgs potential in the nmssm , which consists of @xmath60-terms , @xmath61-terms , and soft susy - breaking terms @xmath62 here @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath46 denote the neutral higgs bosons corresponding to @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the one - loop effective higgs potential is formally given by @xmath67 here @xmath68 is a field - dependent mass - squared matrix , and @xmath69 is the @xmath70 renormalization scale at which all rg evoluved parameers are fixed . since @xmath71 may bring significant radiative corrections to some of the higgs boson masses , we will include it into our analysis .",
    "two - loop corrections to the higgs potential will not be included , but we will comment on their possible effects at the end of this article .    note , even though the one - loop effective higgs potential brings an explicit dependence on @xmath69 , all observables are independent of it .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath72 depends on the fields @xmath73 through their couplings to various other particles .",
    "since it is the strength of these couplings , instead of the absolute values of the masses , that measures the one - loop corrections to the minimization conditions and to the higgs mass matrix , the most important one - loop corrections come from the field - dependent masses of top quark sector and bottom quark sector ( for large @xmath5 case ) . in this paper",

    "but it is also confronted by the common problems of all models of the light singlet mechanism .",
    "let us rephrase these problems in the framework of the nmssm .",
    "consider the minimization conditions of the tree - level higgs potential in the nmssm  @xcite @xmath78 for the minimal gauge mediation , where the messenger sector is @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the susy breaking spurion field and @xmath81 being @xmath82 messenger pairs .",
    "the lower mass bounds of sleptons or gluinos give a lower bound on the effective susy breaking scale @xmath83 according to their rg evolutions .",
    "this lower bound immediately implies another lower bound on the beta function of @xmath84 ( because of its positivity ) , and then leads to @xmath85  @xcite . according to eq.([303 ] ) , this is translated into a stringent bound on the effective @xmath10 parameter or @xmath49 for mildly large @xmath5  @xcite @xmath86 ) a very negative @xmath4 or very large @xmath87 and @xmath88 are necessary in order to generate a large @xmath49 or @xmath10 for @xmath89 .",

    "in addition , because @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the only sources explicitly breaking the global @xmath7 symmetry in the higgs potential , their smallness necessarily leads to an almost massless pseudoscalar which is ruled out by the current lep bound  @xcite . + as a result , the @xmath0 problem is not solved in the nmssm within the minimal gauge mediation scenario  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a new way to solve the @xmath0 problem within the nmssm with gauge - mediated susy breaking . actually , we only take a simple modification to the superpotential , eq.([306 ] ) , assuming the new one to be @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath94 are two susy breaking chiral spurions . in the following , we will use @xmath95 and @xmath96 to denote the effective susy breaking scales , @xmath97 , @xmath98 as explained above , the difficulty in generating a very negative @xmath4 is from the fact that the rg evolutions of @xmath84 and @xmath53 are strongly coupled to each other .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 has a large , positive beta function , so it becomes negative quickly as the rg evolutions run down .",
    "the negative @xmath84 leads to a negative contribution to the beta function of @xmath53 , therefore , preventing the appearance of a large , negative @xmath4 .",
    "however , the story can be dramatically changed after the introduction of a new parameter @xmath99 . in the minimal gauge mediation limit , we have @xmath100 .",
    "as it is increased , the beta function of @xmath53 is effectively enlarged according to the dominant terms @xmath101 , while the beta function of @xmath84 is effectively diminished according to the terms @xmath102 ( even though some other terms may have positive contributions to this beta function . ) . due to these effects",
    ", the velocity for @xmath53 to evolve to a negative value is increased , but that for @xmath84 , is slowed down .",
    "it becomes possible now to get a large , negative @xmath4 , even if only a mild increase is made for @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast to the `` minimal gauge mediation '' , we will refer to this mechanism as `` general gauge mediation '' in the following .    with the superpotential of the messenger sector modified , the soft susy breaking masses are also different from those generated in the minimal gauge mediation case .",

    "the main constraints are from the lightest chargino mass or the lightest @xmath155-even higgs mass , depending on the messenger scale @xmath31 . for @xmath156 ( as typically happens in this model ) , the lightest chargino mass is given by @xmath157 as for the lightest @xmath155-even higgs , it is typically @xmath64-like ( because of the small mixing due to a not large @xmath87 soft term ) .",

    ", this indicates a larger @xmath22 or equivalently , a smaller @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath5 becomes smaller as @xmath31 increases . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath31",
    ", a larger @xmath5 often implies a larger @xmath139 or a smaller @xmath140 . for fixed @xmath140 , a larger",
    "@xmath139 implies a larger beta function for @xmath53 or a more negative @xmath4 , so a smaller @xmath5 can be explained according to the same argument as that in case . for fixed @xmath139 , a smaller @xmath140 implies a larger @xmath49 or @xmath22 according to eq.([316 ] ) and eq.([301 ] ) .",
    "this then leads to a smaller @xmath5 again according to eq([315 ] ) .",
    "a large @xmath5 is welcomed in phenomenology , due to its role in explaining the mass hierarchy of top and bottom quarks or realizing the unification of their yukawa couplings ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) . in our model ,",
    "relatively large values of @xmath5 bring us more than that , since it helps in avoiding an unacceptably light chargino : in the mass formula of the lightest chargino eq.([403 ] ) , the corrections at the order @xmath183 contain a negative contribution @xmath184 which is suppressed by a large @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , a relatively large @xmath5 plays a crucial role in the solution of the light @xmath7 peudoscalar problem .    as first pointed out in  @xcite , small @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( compared to @xmath52 )",
    "induce the presence of a light pseudoscalar . in this limit ,",
    "the mass of the lightest @xmath155-odd higgs boson is approximately given by ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) : @xmath185 where @xmath186 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 being the doublet and singlet @xmath155-odd gauge eigenstates , respectively , and @xmath189 being their mixing angle . depending on its composition , a light pseudoscalar may be in conflict with the strong lep bounds .",
    "as extensively discussed in the literature , this light pseudoscalar should be understood as the nambu - goldstone boson of the global @xmath7 symmetry , since @xmath87 and @xmath88 represent the only two terms explicitly violating this symmetry . however , from table ( [ table1])-([table8 ] ) , it is easy to see that there is no such a problem in our model : for the intermediate- and high - scale gauge - mediations , @xmath50 is typically large , compared to @xmath52 ; for the low - scale case , even though @xmath50 and @xmath51 are small ( except point a8 ) , the light pseudoscalar is extremely singlet - like ( see table([table7 ] ) ) , escaping the experimental constraints successfully .",
    "these features are due to @xmath103 and the relatively large @xmath5 again . consider the strongly coupled rg evolutions of @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath90 ( see rg equations ( [ a110 ] ) , ( [ a111 ] ) and ( [ a113 ] ) ) . at the messenger scale",
    "we have @xmath192 in our model",
    ". a larger @xmath103 implies more negative contributions to the beta functions according to the ew gaugino soft masses , and less negative contributions according to the gluino soft mass .",
    "since the latter is absent in the beta function of @xmath90 , but contributing to those of @xmath190 and @xmath191 , a large @xmath103 necessarily leads to a larger @xmath87 , as long as the evolution pathes are long enough .",
    "this explains the relatively large @xmath87 and large @xmath7 peudoscalar masses in the contexts of the intermediate- and high - scale general gauge mediations . unlike these two cases , the @xmath7 peudoscalar is still light in the low - scale case ( except point a8 ) due to the short rg evolution path for @xmath90 . a relatively large @xmath5 plays a crucial role in avoiding the experimental bound here .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the mixing angle @xmath193 of the @xmath7 pseudoscalar @xmath194 satisfies @xmath195 under the limit of small @xmath87 and @xmath88 . obviously , a relatively large @xmath196 implies @xmath197 and hence an extremely singlet - like @xmath7 pseudoscalar @xmath194 ( see table([table7 ] ) ) .",
    "this is also true for the few examples in the intermediate - scale general gauge mediation ( points b1 , b2 and b3 in table ( [ table7 ] ) ) .",
    "the light @xmath7 pseudoscalar problem , therefore , is no longer a problem in our model .     plane . in the perturbative region ( blank one ) , @xmath139 and @xmath140 keep perturbative up to the gut scale .",
    "the stars on the plane denote the sample points we are studying . the boundary has a weak dependence on yukawa couplings and the messenger scale . here",
    "we set @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 gev.,height=4 ]    to end this section , let us take a look at the possible range of @xmath139 and @xmath140 at the ew scale in the nmssm .",
    "the most serious constraint is from the requirement of @xmath139 and @xmath140 to be perturbative up to the gut scale . for the case where the gauge couplings are the only possible tree - level interactions between the observable and messenger sectors , the boundary between the perturbative and non - perturbative regions has been drawn in fig.([fig1 ] ) , with @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 gev . from the figure",
    ", it is easy to see that both large @xmath132 and large @xmath133 regions have been excluded , and the only allowed region is located in the lower - left corner of the @xmath151 plane .",
    "the boundary in the figure depends on the yukawa couplings as well as the messenger scale . but",
    "this dependence is very weak : there is only a mild shift as these parameters vary in the region in which we are interested .",
    "the stars on the @xmath151 plane denote the sample points we are studying in this paper .",
    "it is easy to see that these points cover almost the whole perturbative region on the @xmath151 plane . in particular , all of them lead to reasonable particle mass spectra which satisfy the current experimental bounds ) for the couplings are given up , the nice features of these examples could be extended into the non - perturbative region on the @xmath151 plane as long as these couplingss stay perturbative at the messenger scale . ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath201 problem is solved in the context of the general gauge mediated susy breaking model analyzed in this work .",
    "although a detailed analysis of the collider signatures of these models is beyond the scope of this article , we would like to stress some relevant properties of these models and their associated phenomenology .",
    "for the low scale gauge mediation , all colored particles are very heavy and therefore very difficult to detect at hadron colliders .",
    "one promising way to test these models is by analyzing the production and two - body decay of the next - to - lightest superparticle ( nlsp ) to gravitino ( @xmath202 ) which is described by @xmath203 here @xmath204 is the susy breaking scale , and @xmath205 is the supercurrent . in our model ,",
    "the nlsp generally is the lightest neutralino which is typically higgsino - like , and in most cases whose mixing with singlino is suppressed ( see table([table8 ] ) for the case with low - scale gauge mediation ) .",
    "so the most important experimental signature would be the di-@xmath206 and di-@xmath179 productions ( if allowed by phase space ) @xmath207 here @xmath208 is any collection of leptons and jets , and @xmath209 denotes the missing energy .",
    "explicitly , under the higgsino - like limit ( with the mixing with the singlino suppressed ) , the decay rates to @xmath206-boson and @xmath179 are given by  @xcite @xmath210 here @xmath211 and @xmath212 are composition coefficients of @xmath213 , and @xmath214 is the @xmath215 higgs mixing angle .",
    "if the singlino component of @xmath213 is not small , e.g. , at a1 point , the di-@xmath194 decay can also provide useful collider signals .",
    "note that in our model independently of that @xmath216 or @xmath217 is assumed , we typically have @xmath218 between a few @xmath219 gev and a few @xmath220 gev , which implies non - prompt di - boson decays  @xcite . this is important since the background for any of the final state signatures can be greatly reduced ( due to the displaced vertices and distinguished angular distribution of the displaced jets from @xmath206 or @xmath179 decays ) if the @xmath221 decay is non - prompt but contained in the tracking region .",
    "it is also important to stress that in the low scale gauge mediated scenario , the higgs decays may be affected by the presence of the light pseudoscalars , @xmath194 .",
    "although the lightest pseudoscalar is mostly a singlet state ( see table  [ table7 ] ) , it will decay into bottom quark and @xmath222 pairs through its mixing with the pseudoscalar component of the higgs doublet @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the higgs decay into two @xmath194 states will induce decays into either four bottom quarks , two bottom quark and two @xmath222 s , or four @xmath222 s final states .",
    "the final signatures of the di-@xmath179 channel in [ 115 ] , necessarily , will also be affected . in all the scenarios we presented ,",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs is sufficiently heavy as to evade the stringent lep constraints on a light cp - even higgs decaying into four bottom quark final states  @xcite .",
    "the presence of these new decay channels will demand new strategies for the search for cp - even higgs bosons at the tevatron and the lhc , as has been recently analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gravitino collider signals are seriously suppressed for intermediate- and high - scale gauge mediations , since the neutralino lifetime will be enhanced by the factor @xmath223 and therefore it will decay beyond the detector .",
    "moreover , whenever light , the charged and neutral higgsinos would be approximately degenerate in mass and therefore difficult to detect by direct production at hadron colliders .",
    "however , colored particles become lighter and therefore they provide the most important search channels at the lhc . in the high - scale case , the gluino mass @xmath224 is typically around 1.5 tev or even smaller , implying an abundant production of gluinos at lhc , according to the gluino ( @xmath225 ) pair production @xmath226 meanwhile , given that the lightest stop @xmath115 is mainly right - handed and much lighter than gluino in this case , one could expect to see the signatures at lhc according to the decaying channels @xmath227 therefore , the final state will be given by four top quarks or two top and two bottom quarks with large missing energy .",
    "an analysis of similar gluino decay channels at the lhc has been performed in ref .",
    "even though we typically have @xmath228 in the high - scale scenario , c9 point is an exception , where @xmath115 is lighter than @xmath213 and @xmath229 .",
    "the light stop @xmath115 is long - lived because its two - body decay to gravitino @xmath230 even if kinematically allowed , is also suppressed by a @xmath231 factor .",
    "in such a case , the stop may have interesting implications on both cosmology and collider signatures . for more details",
    ", readers may refer to  @xcite .    as for the intermediate - scale scenario , even though an abundant production of gluinos at lhc is also expected for many cases , the mass of the lightest stop is typically larger than that of gluinos .",
    "whenever the gluino mass is within kinematic reach of the lhc , they will decay only through off - shell squarks @xmath232 since the neutralinos and charginos appearing in the intermediate states have multiple decay modes , there will be many competing gluino decay chains whose branching ratios are quite sensitive to the parameters of this model .",
    "interested readers may refer to  @xcite and its references .",
    "the general gauge mediation provides a simple way to solve the @xmath0 problem in the nmssm . in this context ,",
    "reasonable values for @xmath0 can be generated by properly modifying the rg evolutions of @xmath84 and @xmath53 by a choice of @xmath103 window .",
    "the ew scale is then stabilized , and phenomenologically interesting spectra of particles and superparticles are also achieved .",
    "these features apply to most of the perturbative ( up to the gut scale ) @xmath55 parameter region in the nmssm and to all phenomenologically interesting messenger scales .",
    "in addition , there is no light @xmath7 pseudoscalar problem in our model . for the intermediate- and high - scale gauge - mediations , due to a relatively heavy spectrum of gauginos , large @xmath50 or @xmath51 ,",
    "comparable with @xmath52 are typical , so the lightest higgs pseudoscalar is not too light .",
    "for the low - scale case , even though @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not always large , the lightest higgs pseudoscalar is extremely singlet - like due to a relatively large @xmath5 favored by our model , escaping the experimental constraints on a light higgs boson .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the introduction of the parameter @xmath103 does not affect the successful prediction of the gauge coupling unification at the gut scale .",
    "recall the threshhold corrections to the gauge coupling unification due to the little hierarchy between the ew scale and the soft susy breaking scale , where @xmath233 and many charged particle species are involved . in the general gauge mediation scenario described in this article ,",
    "the correction to the prediction of @xmath234 induced by the messenger threshold corrections may be estimated by @xmath235 on the other hand , the introduction of @xmath103 also modifies the sparticle threshold corrections , which are approximately given by  @xcite @xmath236    one could compute the difference in the prediction of @xmath234 with respect to the case @xmath237 .",
    "let us consider two cases .",
    "in the first one , the ratio of effective susy breaking scales @xmath238 , and therefore @xmath239 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath240 alternatively , one can consider @xmath241 and therefore @xmath242 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath243 in both cases , the total correction is negative , leading , for @xmath244@xmath245 to a somewhat better agreement between the predicted and measured values of @xmath234 than in the @xmath237 case   case requires the threshold scale @xmath246 . ]",
    ".    one interesting feature on this model is the arising of one physical @xmath155-phase according to the gaugino soft masses . in the nmssm with general gauge mediation ,",
    "there are four independent complex parameters : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and two of the soft gaugino masses @xmath247 , @xmath16 and @xmath248",
    ". among them , the phase of @xmath139 is not physical and can be resolved by the ckm matrix .",
    "in addition , @xmath140 and gaugino soft mass are not invariant under the peccei - quinn symmetry and @xmath7 symmetry , respectively .",
    "the phase of @xmath140 and one phase in the gaugino mass sector hence can be rotated away .",
    "so there is one physical phase left in the soft mass sector of gauginos . on the other hand , it is well - known that the ckm phase is not enough and extra @xmath155-violating sources are required to explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the universe today .",
    "the physical @xmath155 phase appearing in our model may provide a nice chance to understand this cosmic mystery .",
    "for example , in the ew baryogenesis mechanism ( see  @xcite for a review or @xcite for its realization in different supersymmetric models ) , such a phase may induce a net amount of left - chiral weak fermions during the ew phase transition , which is then switched to the baryon asymmetry in the universe according to the ew sphaleron effect .",
    "but , the same as the @xmath155 phases appearing in any other supersymmetric models , the physical @xmath155-phase in our model also needs to satisfy the edm bounds of electron , neutron and mercury atoms . since the masses of the first two family squarks in our model are typically heavier than @xmath249 tev , it might be viable to suppress its one - loop contributions to the edms according to the heavy squark mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is claimed recently  @xcite that in a context similar to ours , a large @xmath155-phase of order @xmath250 can be consistent with all edm bounds according to some cancellation effects , with no necessity to require the squarks of the first two families to be heavy .",
    "it is interesting to ask why the situation is so different between the class of models  @xcite and our model , since both of them have a total of four free input parameters , with one messenger coupling in the former case replaced by the parameter @xmath103 in our model . to great extent",
    "this is due to the different ways in which the negative soft mass square @xmath4 is generated . in the former case , the authors try to generate a negative @xmath4 directly according to the boundary conditions at the messenger scale .",
    "they let the singlet @xmath43 directly couple to the messengers .",
    "then , the contribution of this coupling to @xmath251 at two - loop level are negative .",
    "but this coupling has similar negative contributions to @xmath252 making @xmath84 get enough negative values quickly to induce ew symmetry breaking .",
    "this in turn refrains @xmath53 from getting a too negative value at the ew scale according to the rg evolution . in our model",
    ", we try to generate a negative @xmath4 by modifying the related rg evolutions .",
    "the introduced parameter @xmath103 have opposite effects on the beta functions @xmath84 and @xmath53 , so the evolution of @xmath53 to a negative value is accelerated while that of @xmath84 is slowed down .",
    "this allows @xmath53 have enough time to obtain a very negative value before @xmath84 induces the ew symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , unlike the former case , the trilinear soft parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 are highly suppressed at the messenger scale , which leads to a relatively large @xmath5 at the ew scale .",
    "this relatively large @xmath5 not only helps lift the mass of the lightest chargino , but more importantly , help solve the light @xmath7 pseudoscalar problem by suppressing its mixing with the sm - like @xmath155-odd higgs components .",
    "the general gauge mediation is natural because of its simplicity and universality .",
    "it is very simple , only requiring minimal messenger spectrum in the messenger sector and with no additional symmetry or new dimensional parameters introduced .",
    "most importantly , it can naturally arise from a general hidden sector , as pointed out in subsection  [ the model ] .",
    "since the construction of this model is independent of the visible sector , its idea can also be extended to many other contexts without much difficulty , e.g. , the nmssm and the umssm , or even help the class of models in  @xcite obtain more reasonable physical results . due to the similar structures of the related beta functions , we believe that similar effects could be seen in these extensions .",

    "<S> because of the two effective susy breaking scales @xmath3 in the messenger sector , the renormalization group evolutions of the soft susy breaking parameters can be properly modified , leading to a negative enough singlet soft mass square @xmath4 and hence reasonable @xmath0 values . </S>",
    "<S> in most of the perturbative ( up to the gut scale ) parameter region , as a result , the electroweak scale is stabilized and phenomenologically interesting mass spectra of particles and superparticles are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this model favors large values of @xmath5 : @xmath6 and a heavy scalar spectrum . with the relatively large @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the light @xmath7 pseudoscalar ( mainly appearing in the low - scale gauge - mediated susy breaking models ) becomes extremely singlet - like , and is no longer a problem in this model . </S>",
