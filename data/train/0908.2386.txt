    "the high energy scattering is characterized by regge kinematics where the transferred momentum is much smaller than the center - of - mass energy of the scattered particles .",

    "the pomeron is described by balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov  ( bfkl ) @xcite evolution equation for a composite state of two reggeized gluons in @xmath1-channel .",
    "the reggeization of gluons modifies the gluon propagator by @xmath6 and is a consequence of the `` bootstrap '' condition which implies that a system two or more reggeized gluons projected on color octet state collapses to one reggeized gluon .",
    "the bfkl evolution equation resums contributions of @xmath7 where the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 is accompanied by the same power of the logarithm of energy  ( leading logarithm approximation - lla ) .",
    "this resummation assumes multi - regge kinematics of @xmath0-channel gluons with their large relative separation in rapidity .",
    "the bfkl equation was solved by lipatov @xcite exploiting the two dimensional conformal invariance of the bfkl kernel .",
    "it was also noticed @xcite that the conformal bfkl hamiltonian has an additional symmetry , namely , it is invariant under a change of variables @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath11th reggeized gluon and @xmath12 is the fourier conjugate to it coordinate .",
    "this symmetry , named _ the duality symmetry _",
    ", is a result of the integrability of the bfkl equation .",

    "@xmath13 a gluon can be viewed as a double quark - antiquark line and only the nearest neighbor interactions survive .",
    "the dipole model was formulated for a color singlet scattering amplitude in light - cone gauge , while the momentum bfkl is valid for any color state and an arbitrary number of colors @xmath13 . despite the fact that the dipole formulation appears as a special case of the bfkl evolution",

    "the full correspondence between the two formulations is still not fully clear , in particular , the exact relation between gluon reggeization and dipole wave function renormalization was not completely verified .",
    "both , gluon reggeization and dipole renormalization come from virtual contributions , but by virtue of the fourier transform the virtual contributions are _ partly _ transformed into the real emission terms .    in the present study",
    "we address the duality symmetry , we show that it can be viewed as a duality between the reggeized gluon and dipole formulations of the linear bfkl evolution .",
    "we find that the duality symmetry also holds for the non - linear bk evolution equation provided we impose a condition dual to the dipole size conservation .",
    "the clear physical meaning of duality symmetry as a symmetry between reggeized gluon formulation and the dipole picture provides a corresponding uv / ir duality , which is likely to hold at nlo bfkl in @xmath14 super yang - mills and beyond .",
    "the two dimensional duality symmetry of the bfkl and the bk equations can further be related to the four dimensional dual conformal symmetry used in wilson loops / scattering amplitude duality  @xcite as well as to @xmath15-duality exploited in ads / cft calculations of gluon scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the paper organized as follows .    at the beginning we present a brief introduction to the bfkl equation in the conformal basis and explain the meaning of the duality symmetry in this formalism",
    "next , we demonstrate the duality symmetry as a symmetry between the bfkl equation in the momentum space and its dipole formulation . in the upcoming section",
    "we show that it extends to the non - linear case of the bk equation .",
    "then we give a physical interpretation of the duality symmetry for the non - forward evolution .",
    "some calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "in the scattering at very high energies the scattering amplitude in the leading logarithmic approximation  ( lla ) is obtained by summing contributions of the order of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the coupling constant . in this limit @xmath1-channel gluons reggeize and",
    "the bfkl pomeron appears as a composite state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "the relevant kinematics is called multi - regge kinematics and it is characterized by the factorization of the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom . due to this factorization the bfkl pomeron can be written as a state in the two dimensional transverse space that evolves with rapidity which plays a role of an imaginary time .",
    "this fact makes it possible to formulate the color singlet bfkl dynamics in form of the schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath18 for a system of @xmath19-reggeized gluons @xcite , the bfkl equation is obtained for @xmath20 .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that in the leading order bfkl the multiregge kinematics selects only gluons , the contributions of other particles are suppressed due the powerlike behavior of the amplitude @xmath65 , where @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the exchanged particle .",
    "this means that in the multiregge kinematics qcd is not much different from @xmath14 sym , and the factorization of the longitudinal  ( rapidity ) and the transverse momenta explains why the duality symmetry of the bfkl dynamics in two dimensions should be related to the four - dimensional dual conformal symmetry in multicolor @xmath14 sym amplitudes .    from the strong coupling side ,",
    "the gluon scattering amplitudes were calculated using gauge / string duality or ads / cft correspondence and the crucial assumption was the validity of the fermionic @xmath15-duality .",
    "applying fermionic @xmath15-duality in the form very similar to the dual coordinates the authors calculated the classical string solution for a four point scattering amplitude , which agrees with the bern - dixon - smirnov  ( bds ) ansatz @xcite , wl amplitudes and the solution to the bfkl equation .",
    "further analysis of amplitudes with a higher number of external legs showed the validity of this assumption .",

    "the main objective of the present study is to give a physical interpretation of the duality symmetry of the bfkl approach as a symmetry between the reggeized gluon formulation and the dipole picture . in particular , we show that the duality symmetry can be viewed as a symmetry under rotation of the bfkl kernel in the transverse plane from @xmath0-channel to @xmath1-channel and back .",
    "this suggests a similar interpretation for the dual conformal symmetry of the scattering amplitudes in an arbitrary kinematics . in the next section",
    "we consider the forward bfkl equation and show its selfduality with a proper choice of the fourier transform .",

    "an analogous constraint is to be imposed on the momentum coordinates @xmath149 by virtue of duality symmetry , because @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath150 are conjugate to @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath88 , respectively . this way we remove extra integration and find that @xmath151 .",
