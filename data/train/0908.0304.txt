    "undoubtedly , the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation is one of the most fundamental nonlinear lattice dynamical models .",
    "part of its relevance is due to its being one of the main discrete analogs of the famous ( and integrable in 1 + 1 dimensions ) continuum nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite .",
    "the latter is encountered in a wide spectrum of applications ; it is the relevant dispersive envelope wave model for the electric field in optical fibers @xcite , for the self - focusing and collapse of langmuir waves in plasma physics @xcite or for the description of freak waves ( the so - called rogue waves ) in the ocean @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dnls model is of physical interest in its own right within a diverse host of applications ; see the reviews @xcite , as well as the recent book @xcite .",
    "one of the principal directions that spurred a considerable interest in the dnls model was the area of the nonlinear optics of fabricated algaas waveguide arrays @xcite . in this seting",
    ", a plethora of important phenomena have been experimentally investigated including discrete diffraction , peierls barriers ( the energetic barrier that a wave needs to overcome to move over a lattice ) , diffraction management ( the periodic alternation of the diffraction coefficient ) @xcite and gap solitons ( structures localized due to nonlinearity in the gap of the underlying linear spectrum ) @xcite among others @xcite .",
    "more recently , quasi - periodic @xcite and even completely disordered @xcite variants of such waveguide lattices have been constructed , allowing the observation of localization type phenomena ( even within the linear regime for ones of the anderson type ) .",
    "many of these results and the corresponding theoretical activity that they triggered has been summarized in a number of reviews see e.g. @xcite .",
    "another independent and considerably different physical setting where dnls - type models naturally arise is that of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped within periodic ( so - called , optical lattice ) potentials created by counter - propagating laser beams in one- , two- or even three- spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "this area of atomic physics has also experienced a huge growth over the past few years , including the prediction and manifestation of modulational instabilities ( i.e. , the instability of spatially uniform states towards spatially modulated ones ) @xcite , the observation of gap solitons @xcite , landau - zener tunneling ( tunneling between different bands of the periodic potential ) @xcite and bloch oscillations ( for matter waves subject to combined periodic and linear potentials ) @xcite among many other salient features ; reviews of the theoretical and experimental findings in this area have also recently appeared in @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present communication is to consider a somewhat non - standard variant of the dnls equation , namely one in which the interaction kernel within the linear term allows interactions among _ any _ set of neighbors .",
    "such , so - called , nonlocal versions of the dnls model have been abundantly considered in the past , yielding numerous interesting features .",
    "in particular , it was shown , for instance , that , if the interaction strength decays sufficiently slowly as a function of distance , it can give rise to bistability of fundamental solitary waves ( centered on a single site ) @xcite , which may find applications in their controllable switching @xcite .",
    "dynamical lattices with long - range interactions also serve as models for energy and charge transport in biological molecules @xcite .",
    "systems including the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction have also been proposed as models of polymers @xcite , as well as in the case of optical waveguide arrays near the zero - dispersion point @xcite .",
    "nonlinear lattice models with competing short- and long - range interactions were studied not only in one , but also in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "lastly , it is relevant to mention that quantum dnls models with nonlocal interactions were another subject of study ( by means of the bethe ansatz ) @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that such longer - range interactions are often directly relevant to physical applications .",
    "for example , in the case of the waveguide arrays , the nnn interaction is also , in principle , present yet its relative strength depends on the ratio of the separation between adjacent cores to the wavelength of light . a specific , zigzag - shaped , model of an optical array involving a nnn coupling",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , allowing for essentially arbitrary ratios of nearest- to next - nearest - neighbor interactions , depending on the specific geometry .",
    "lately , long - range interactions , especially of a dipolar type have become of considerable interest in becs due to the significant component of dipole - dipole interactions in @xmath1cr .",
    "these effects , as well as the significant component of studies of such dipolar becs in optical lattices have recently been summarized in @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present communication is to explore the non - local variant of dnls in the vicinity of the so - called anti - continuum ( ac ) limit , where all individual sites ( i.e. , waveguides in optics or wells of the optical lattice in bec ) are uncoupled .",
    "from there , in the spirit of @xcite , we can develop a perturbative expansion using the strength of the interactions as the relevant small parameter .",
    "this allows us to derive conditions for the persistence of states near the ac - limit , as well as to formulate a framework to address their linear stability .",
    "both the existence conditions , as well as the stability conditions allow us to infer valuable conclusions .",
    "the existence conditions suggest ( and numerical computations corroborate ) the possibility that solutions with a _ nontrivial phase distribution _ may arise in the 1d setting , a feature which is absent in the case of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions ; even the sole inclusion of nnn interactions allows to achieve this feature . on the other hand ,",
    "concerning stability , the inclusion of nnn interactions may also play an important role , as we illustrate with a two - dimensional example : the stabilization of a topological charge @xmath0 vortex ( which is unstable in the presence of nn interactions ) is numerically observed and analytically justified .",
    "our analytical considerations are presented in section ii , while section iii is devoted to the corresponding numerical results ( and their comparison to theory ) .",
    "finally , section iv summarizes our findings and suggests a number of interesting future directions .",
    "our nonlocal variant of the dnls equation will be of the following form : @xmath2 where the overdot denotes temporal ( in the case of becs in optical lattices ) or spatial ( in the case of waveguide arrays ) derivatives , @xmath3 denotes the site index ( waveguide index in the optical case , or optical lattice well in becs ) , and @xmath4 controls the strength of the coupling among sites , which is also determined by the `` coupling matrix '' with elements @xmath5 .",
    "the dependent variable @xmath6 represents the complex envelope of the electric field in optics , or the complex wavefunction of the bec in atomic physics .",
    "the ac limit is defined by @xmath7 , in which case the unperturbed energy of the uncoupled oscillators reads @xmath8 once the inter - site coupling is turned on , the relevant perturbation in the energy reads : @xmath9 notice that at the ac limit , the solutions for the excited oscillators will be @xmath10 , where the @xmath11 s are arbitrary phase parameters ( @xmath12 corresponds to the non - excited sites ) .    to determine the persistence of the waves , as was illustrated in @xcite ( see also the general framework of @xcite or the nearest - neighbor case of @xcite ) one has to evaluate the perturbed energy at the unperturbed limit solution , in which case , we can straightforwardly evaluate it to be : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of excited ( adjacent in this case , for simplicity , although the theory can be appropriately generalized for non - adjacent ) oscillators .",
    "the general persistence conditions then read @xmath15 @xcite , i.e. , the unperturbed wave needs to correspond to an extremum of the perturbation energy in order to persist .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath16    on the other hand , the general stability theory of @xcite ( again see @xcite for a particular application in the case of nearest - neighbor interactions ) allows us to quantify the bifurcation of the @xmath17 eigenvalues from @xmath18 .",
    "there are @xmath14 eigenvalues at @xmath18 when @xmath7 , and only one of them remains there for finite @xmath19 , due to the u@xmath20 symmetry and associated phase invariance , while @xmath17 acquire small ( o@xmath21 or smaller ) values , as the sites become coupled .",
    "these eigenvalues satisfy the reduced eigenvalue problem @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 i.e. , the stability is effectively determined by the _",
    "jacobian _ of the persistence conditions .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this general formulation encompasses the nearest - neighbor one of @xcite as a special case .",
    "the above formulas , namely eq . ( [ lrdnls5 ] ) describing the existence and eqs . ( [ lrdnls5a])-([lrdnls7 ] ) quantifying the stability under weak coupling are the main analytical results of the present study , which we now proceed to utilize in specific applications where additional ( to the nearest neighbor ) interactions exist .",
    "in this section , we apply the above analysis to a few select cases where interactions other than purely nearest neighbor ones are included , so as to provide a sense of the kind of additional features that such settings may entail and how these features are brought forth through the above analysis .",
    "we start with what arguably can be dubbed the simplest extension of nn interactions , namely the inclusion of the nnn ones which is directly physically realizable , as per the setting of @xcite .",
    "we start from the case of equal nn and nnn interactions only , i.e. , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the kronecker @xmath25 . considering then a @xmath26 site configuration ( the smallest one that `` perceives '' of the presence of the nnn interaction ) , it is straightforward to intuitively realize that this is essentially the analog of an equilateral triangle where all pairwise interactions exist and are equal to each other .",
    "this is a situation that has been considered both in dnls @xcite ( see also the early work of @xcite ) and in klein - gordon @xcite type settings , motivated by applications of triangular lattices in photorefractive crystals and dusty plasmas .",
    "it has been illustrated therein that the fundamental _ linearly stable _ 3-excited - site configuration is that of a so - called vortex of topological charge @xmath27 , namely a situation where the phase runs from @xmath28 at the first excited site , to @xmath29 at the second one and @xmath30 at the third one .",
    "remarkably , all configurations with the standard ( from the nn setting of @xcite ) case of @xmath28 or @xmath31 phases , are unstable . equally importantly the nn case , as per the arguments of @xcite",
    ", never allows for the existence of phases other than @xmath28 or @xmath31 in 1d configurations .",
    "hence , one of the principal features of these non - nearest - neighbor interactions is that they may enable configurations that would not be possible in standard nn settings .",
    "moreover , as indicated above in this case , the eigenvalues can be analytically computed ( through a discrete fourier transform applied to the `` triangle '' of sites ( which has periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "this can be found to lead to the eigenvalues @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the stable case features the relative phase between adjacent sites @xmath34 and yields a double pair of imaginary eigenvalues @xmath35 which are compared to the full numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( also the analytical existence prediction for the relative angle among adjacent sites is tested through the numerical results of the figure ) .",
    "good agreement is obtained between the analytical and numerical results in both existence and stability , for small values of @xmath19 , while , as expected , relevant deviations increase for larger values of the perturbation parameter .",
    "we also note in passing that the non - trivial phase vortex structure becomes unstable eventually in an oscillatory way due to a complex quartet of eigenvalues for @xmath36 as also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , due to the collision of one of the imaginary pairs with the continuous spectrum extending above @xmath37 ( and below @xmath38 ) .     in the 1d case with equal nearest and next - nearest - neighbor interaction strengths of unity , i.e. , @xmath39 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we considered another physically realizable ( as per @xcite ) case where @xmath45 ( while all other interactions are absent ) .",
    "again , focusing on the 3-site interaction , we realize that the three persistence conditions can be explicitly solved , yielding two possible scenarios .",
    "either @xmath46 for all combinations of @xmath47 _ or _ @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
