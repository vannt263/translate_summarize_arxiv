    "the higgs boson  @xcite is required by the standard model ( sm )  @xcite but has not yet been observed  @xcite . at lep ii energies it should be produced mainly through the `` higgs - strahlung '' process ( @xmath90 ) if its mass is sufficiently low . in the sm , the higgs boson dominantly decays into a pair of the heaviest kinematically accessible particles , which would be a b - quark pair at lep ii . in some models beyond the sm , however , the higgs boson can decay predominantly into a pair of invisible particles if the process is kinematically allowed .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite is one of the models which allows for invisibly decaying higgs bosons  @xcite , through the @xmath91 process , where  is the lightest neutralino , if the mass of  is lighter than half of the higgs mass and r - parity is conserved . if  is purely photino - like , the decay @xmath91 is suppressed . in this case a decay @xmath92 , where  is the second lightest neutralino , becomes dominant if it is allowed kinematically . if the mass difference ( ) between  and  is small , the visible products of the decay @xmath93 are soft and the event topology is similar to that produced by an invisible higgs decay @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 processes are therefore referred to as nearly invisible higgs decays .    in a non - linear supersymmetric model",
    ", the higgs boson can decay into a neutrino plus a goldstino  @xcite , and the invisible decay can be dominant . in other models beyond the sm with a spontaneously broken global symmetry , the higgs boson could decay into a pair of massless goldstone bosons , called majorons  @xcite , which couple strongly to the higgs boson . in models with extra dimensions",
    ", the higgs boson can decay into a neutrino pair  @xcite or can oscillate into invisible states if the higgs boson mixes with a graviscalar  @xcite which is a scalar graviton and escapes in the extra dimension .",
    "models which introduce hidden scalar sectors which couple to the higgs sector can also cause invisible decays of the higgs boson  @xcite .    in this paper , a search for invisibly decaying higgs bosons @xmath94 is presented using the data collected at various centre - of - mass energies ( @xmath2 ) between 183 and 209  by the opal detector at lep , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  .",
