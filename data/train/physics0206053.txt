    "we consider the first steps of analysis of beam - beam interactions in some collective model approach .",
    "it is well - known that neither direct pic modeling nor soft - gaussian approximation provide reasonable resolution of computing time / noise problems and understanding of underlying complex nonlinear dynamics [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "recent analysis , based as on numerical simulation as on modeling , demonstrates that presence of coherent modes inside the spectrum leads to oscillations and growth of beam transverse size and deformations of beam shape .",
    "this leads to strong limitations for operation of lhc .",
    "additional problems appear as a result of continuum spectrum of incoherent oscillations in each beam .",
    "the strong - strong collisions of two beams also lead to variation of transverse size . according to [ 2 ] it is reasonable to find nonperturbative solutions at least in the important particular cases .",
    "our approach based on wavelet analysis technique is in some sense the direct generalization of fast multipole method ( fmm ) and related approaches ( hfmm ) .",
    "after set - up based on vlasov - like model ( according [ 2 ] ) in part 2 , we consider variational - wavelet approach [ 3]-[17 ] in framework of powerful technique based on fast wavelet transform ( fwt ) operator representations [ 18 ] in section 3 . as a result",
    "we have multiresolution / multiscale fast convergent decomposition in the bases of high - localized exact nonlinear eigenmodes represented by wavelets or wavelet packets functions .",
    "the constructed solutions represent the full multiscale spectrum in all internal hidden scales from slow to fast oscillating eigenmodes .",
    "underlying variational method provides algebraical control of the spectrum .",
    "vlasov - like equations describing evolution of the phase space distributions @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) for each beam are [ 2 ] : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the density of the opposite beam , @xmath5 is unperturbed fractional tune , @xmath6 is horizontal beam - beam parameter , @xmath7 is a number of particles , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are normalized variables .",
    "this model describes horizontal oscillations of flat beams with one bunch per beam , one interaction point , equal energy , population and optics for both beams .",
    "one of the key points of wavelet approach demonstrates that for a large class of operators wavelets are good approximation for true eigenvectors and the corresponding matrices are almost diagonal .",
    "fwt [ 18 ] gives the maximum sparse form of operators under consideration ( 1 ) .",
    "it is true also in case of our vlasov - like system of equations ( 1 ) .",
    "we have both differential and integral operators inside .",
    "so , let us denote our ( integral / differential ) operator from equations ( 1 ) as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and its kernel as @xmath12 .",
    "we have the following representation : @xmath13 in case when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are wavelets @xmath16 ( 3 ) provides the standard representation for operator @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider multiresolution representation @xmath17 .",
    "the basis in each @xmath18 is @xmath19 , where indices @xmath20 represent translations and scaling respectively .",
    "let @xmath21 @xmath22 be projection operators on the subspace @xmath18 corresponding to level @xmath23 of resolution : @xmath24 let @xmath25 be the projection operator on the subspace @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) then we have the following `` microscopic or telescopic '' representation of operator t which takes into account contributions from each level of resolution from different scales starting with the coarsest and ending to the finest scales [ 18 ] : @xmath28 we remember that this is a result of presence of affine group inside this construction .",
    "the non - standard form of operator representation [ 18 ] is a representation of operator t as a chain of triples @xmath29 , acting on the subspaces @xmath18 and @xmath26 : @xmath30 where operators @xmath31 are defined as @xmath32 the operator @xmath10 admits a recursive definition via @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 acts on @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that operator @xmath37 describes interaction on the scale @xmath23 independently from other scales , operators @xmath38 describe interaction between the scale j and all coarser scales , the operator @xmath35 is an `` averaged '' version of @xmath39 .",
    "we may compute such non - standard representations for different operators ( including calderon - zygmund or pseudodifferential ) . as in case of differential operator as in other cases we need only to solve the system of linear algebraical equations .",
    "the action of integral operator in equations ( 1 ) we may consider as a hilbert transform @xmath40 the representation of @xmath41 on @xmath42 is defined by the coefficients @xmath43 which according to @xmath44 technique define also all other coefficients of the nonstandard representation .",
    "so we have @xmath45 with the corresponding matrix elements @xmath46 which can be computed from coefficients @xmath47 only : @xmath48 the coefficients @xmath47 ( 7 ) can be obtained from @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the so called autocorrelation coefficients of the corresponding quadratic mirror filter @xmath51 : @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , which parametrizes the basic refinement equation @xmath58 this equation really generates all wavelet zoo .",
    "it is useful to add to the system ( 9 ) the following asymptotic condition @xmath59 , which simplifies the solution procedure .",
    "then finally we have the following action of operator @xmath35 on sufficiently smooth function @xmath14 : @xmath60 in the wavelet basis @xmath61 where @xmath62 are wavelet coefficients .",
    "so , we have simple linear parametrization of matrix representation of our operator ( 6 ) in wavelet bases and of the action of this operator on arbitrary vector in proper functional space .",
    "the similar approach can be applied to other operators in ( 1 ) .",
    "then we may apply our variational approach from [ 3]-[17 ] .",
    "let l be an arbitrary ( non ) linear ( differential / integral ) operator corresponds to the system ( 1 ) with matrix dimension @xmath63 , which acts on some set of functions @xmath64",
    "+ @xmath65 @xmath66 , @xmath67 , + @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "let us consider now the n mode approximation for solution as the following ansatz ( in the same way we may consider different ansatzes ) [ 17 ] : @xmath70 we shall determine the coefficients of expansion from the following conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 3]-[16 ] ) : @xmath71",
    "so , we have exactly @xmath72 algebraical equations for @xmath72 unknowns @xmath73 .",
    "the solution is parametrized by solutions of two set of reduced algebraical problems , one is linear or nonlinear ( depends on the structure of operator l ) and the rest are some linear problems related to computation of coefficients of algebraic equations",
    ". these coefficients can be found by some wavelet methods by using compactly supported wavelet basis functions for expansions ( 12 ) .",
    "we may consider also different types of wavelets including general wavelet packets .",
    "the constructed solution has the following multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes @xmath74 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time / space scales .",
    "formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into the slow part @xmath75 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary n , m , l. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first terms in the rhs of formulae ( 13 ) correspond on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second ones to detail space .",
    "the using of wavelet basis with high - localized properties provides fast convergence of constructed decomposition ( 13 ) .",
    "in contrast with different approaches , formulae ( 13 ) does not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and represents dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion .",
    "numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and related wavelet families .",
    "figures  1,2 demonstrate resonances region and corresponding nonlinear coherent eigenmodes decomposition according to representation ( 13 ) .",
