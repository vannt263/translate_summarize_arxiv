    "the standard lcdm cosmology is very successful in explaining the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and large scale structure ( lss ) formation .",
    "however , lcdm faces some fundamental difficulties . from the observational point of view , the challenges to lcdm arise from smaller scales .",
    "for example , the theory can not explain tully - fisher law and the freeman law @xcite .",
    "the most difficult ones are the satellites problem and cusps problem .",
    "the most key problems are , of course , the unknown nature of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) . before cdm particles",
    "are detected in the lab , science should remain open to the prospect that dm ( and for the similar reasons , de ) phenomena may have some deep underlying reason in new physics .",
    "there are several proposals for resolving dm and de problems by modifying newtonian gravity or general relativity ( gr ) rather than resorting to some kinds of exotic matter or energy .",
    "mond @xcite was originally proposed to explain the observed asymptotically flat rotation curves of galaxies without dm , however , it was noticed that mond can also explain tully - fisher law and freeman law @xcite .",
    "it is believed that mond is successful at galactic scales @xcite ( but see @xcite for satellites problem ) .",
    "the challenges to mond arise from clusters of galaxies @xcite , in which , some kind of dark matter , possibly some massive neutrinos with the mass of @xmath3ev , is also needed to explain the dynamics of galaxies@xcite .",
    "mond and its relativistic version , teves @xcite , are only concerned with dm , remain de as it is . by adding a @xmath4 term in einstein - hilbert lagrangian , where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , the so called @xmath4 gravity theory can account for de @xcite . another interesting theory is modified gravity ( mog ) @xcite , it is a fully relativistic theory of gravitation that is derived from a relativistic action principle involving scalar , tensor and vector fields .",
    "mog has been used successfully to account for galaxy cluster masses @xcite , the rotation curves of galaxies ( similar to mond ) @xcite , velocity dispersions of satellite galaxies @xcite , globular clusters @xcite and bullet cluster @xcite , all without resorting to dm .",
    "most recently , mog is used to investigate some cosmological observations ( cmb , galaxy mass power spectrum and supernova ) , and it is found that mog provides good fits to data without dm and de @xcite .",
    "any modifications to traditional gravity theory must be tested with observational experiments .",
    "gravitational lensing provides a powerful probe to test gravity theory @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , in standard cosmology ( lcdm ) , when galaxies are modeled by a sis and galaxy clusters are modeled by a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile , the predicted strong lensing probabilities can match the results of class / jvas quite well @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to explore the strong lensing statistics in teves theory . as an alternative to lcdm cosmology ,",
    "teves cosmology has received much attention in the recent literature , in particular in the aspect of gravitational lensing @xcite , for reviews see @xcite . before teves , strong gravitational lensing in the mond regime",
    "could only be manipulated by extrapolating non - relativistic dynamics @xcite , in which the deflection angle is only half the value in teves @xcite . in teves theory , it is now established that , for galaxy clusters , both weak and strong lensing need extra dm to explain observations @xcite , possibly neutrinos with the mass of @xmath3ev , like the dynamics of galaxies .",
    "the situation is better for galaxies , as will be shown in this paper . in our previous paper @xcite , as a first try to calculate the strong lensing probability as a function of the image - separation @xmath6 in teves cosmology , we assumed a flat cosmology with @xmath7 and the simplest interpolating function @xmath8 . in this paper , we assume an open cosmology with @xmath0 and @xmath1 and three different kinds of interpolating functions . as for mass function , in addition to the phj gsmf @xcite used in our previous paper , we also adopt a redshift - dependent fontana gsmf @xcite .",
    "further more , the amplification bias is calculated based on the total magnification of the outer two brighter images rather than the magnification of the second bright image of the three images as did in our previous work @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing can be used to test teves in two aspects . first , in the non - relativistic and spherical limit , teves reduces to mond .",
    "the deflection angle of the light ray passing through the lensing object can be calculated in mondian regime ( this will be discussed later ) .",
    "second , the distances between the source , the lens and the observer are cosmological and thus depend on the geometry and evolution properties of the background universe . as argued by bekenstein @xcite , the scalar field @xmath9 , which is used to produce a mondian gravitational acceleration in non - relativistic limit , contributes negligibly to hubble expansion .",
    "according to the cosmological principle , the physical metric takes the usual friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form in teves @xcite , @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 is the scale factor and @xmath13 & $ ( k<0)$}\\ ] ] as in general relativity ( gr ) , we define the cosmological parameters : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean baryonic matter density in the universe at present time @xmath16 ( redshift @xmath17 ) , @xmath18mpc@xmath19 is the present critical mass density , and @xmath20kms@xmath21mpc@xmath21 is the hubble constant .",
    "we choose @xmath22 .",

    "it is well known that the stellar component of an elliptical galaxy can be well modeled by a hernquist profile @xmath42 with the mass interior to @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total mass and @xmath46 is the scale length .",
    "the corresponding newtonian acceleration is @xmath47 . according to mond @xcite",
    ", the actual acceleration @xmath48 is related to newtonian acceleration by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the interpolating function and has the properties @xmath51 and @xmath52cms@xmath53 is the critical acceleration below which gravitational law transits from newtonian regime to mondian regime .",
    "the concrete form of a @xmath50 function should be determined by observational data ( e.g. , the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ) and expected by a reasonable scalar field theory ( e.g. , teves ) .",
    "the  standard \" function one usually takes is @xmath54 , which fits well to the rotation curves of most galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , if the mond effect is produced by a scalar field ( such as teves ) , the  standard \" @xmath50 function turns out to be multivalued @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a  simple \" function @xmath2 suggested by famaey & binney @xcite fits observational data better than the  standard \" function and is consistent with a scalar field relativistic extension of mond @xcite .    in order to explore a broad class of modified gravity models , zhao and",
    "tian @xcite proposed a parametrized modification function @xmath55^{\\frac{1}{n } } , \\label{gmu}\\ ] ] in which , mond gravity corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ ac ] ) into equation ( [ gmu ] ) with @xmath56 , we have @xmath57^{-\\frac{1}{n } } , \\label{mond_gmu}\\ ] ] which can be easily solved to obtain the usual form of the @xmath58 function for mond @xcite @xmath59^{-2/n } , \\ \\ \\ \\ x=\\frac{g}{a_0}. \\label{ap}\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that the  simple \" and  standard \" @xmath58 function are approximated with high accuracy by equation ( [ ap ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the requirement for a physical and monotonic @xmath58 function limits the parameter @xmath62 to the range of @xmath63 . in this paper , we consider three cases : @xmath64 , 2.0 and 3.0 .",
    "since the mondian gravitational acceleration @xmath65 is explicitly expressed in terms of the newtonian acceleration @xmath66 , it is very convenient to use equation ( [ gmu ] ) to calculate the deflection angle @xmath67^{1/n}\\rmd l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we have @xmath70^{1/n}}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}[0.05r_{\\rm h}(c / h_0)/(d_{\\rm l}\\theta)+\\sqrt{1+x^2}]}\\rmd x , \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the characteristic mass of galaxies @xcite , and @xmath73 in equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ ag ] ) , the image position angle @xmath74 and the scale length @xmath75 are in units of arcsecond ( @xmath76 ) and kpc , respectively .",
    "we need a relationship between the scale length @xmath46 and the mass @xmath77 , which could be determined by observational data .",
    "first , the scale length is related to the effective ( or half - light ) radius @xmath78 of a luminous galaxy by @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that there exists a correlation between @xmath78 and the mean surface brightness @xmath80 interior to @xmath78 @xcite : @xmath81 .",
    "since the luminosity interior to @xmath78 ( half - light ) is @xmath82 , one immediately finds @xmath83 .",
    "second , we need to know the mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the observed data gives @xmath85 @xcite ; according to mond , however , we should find @xmath86 @xcite . in any case",
    "we have @xmath87 therefore , the scale length should be related to the stellar mass of a galaxy by @xmath88 , and the coefficient @xmath89 should be further determined by observational data . without a well defined sample at our disposal ,",
    "we use the galaxy lenses which have an observed effective radius @xmath78 ( and thus @xmath46 ) in the castles survey @xcite , which are listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "the fitted formulae for @xmath75 are @xmath90 in later calculations , except indicated , we use the fitted formula of @xmath75 for @xmath91 as required by mond .",
    "in lcdm cosmology , mass function of virialized cdm halos can be obtained in two independent ways .",
    "one is via the generalized press - schechter ( ps ) theory , the other is via schechter luminosity function . in teves ,",
    "however , the ps - like theory does not exist .",
    "fortunately , the stellar mass function of galaxies is available in the literature , including the one constrained by the most recent data @xcite .    before giving the galaxy stellar mass functions ( gsmf ) appeared in the most recent literature , it is helpful to derive a gsmf directly from the schechter luminosity function and mass - to - light ratio .",

    "we normalize the three mass functions to the same value of characteristic mass @xmath72 .",

    "the observed lensing probabilities can be easily calculated @xcite by @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the number of lenses with separation greater than @xmath6 in 13 lenses . for comparison ,",
    "the observational probability @xmath174 for the survey results of class / jvas is also shown ( thick histogram ) .",
    "it would be helpful for us to figure out differences among models to summarize the values of the probabilities @xmath175 in the table 1 .",
    "we have calculated the lensing probability with image separation larger than a given value @xmath6 in an open , teves cosmology .",
    "the results are sensitive to the interpolating function @xmath50 and mass function @xmath176 . for a given gsmf ( phj in figure [ prob_phj ] and fontana in figure [ prob_fontana ] ) , the lensing probability decreases with increasing value of @xmath62 [ given in equation ( [ ap ] ) ] .",
    "obviously , for phj gsmf ( figure [ prob_phj ] ) , the lensing probabilities calculated in teves ( solid lines for three cases of interpolating functions ) are too large at small lensing image separations compared with the results of class / jvas .",
    "this unreasonable result is further confirmed , when we note that , even the lensing probabilities in gr cosmology ( with no dm , dotted lines ) are much larger than that in lcdm cosmology ( dashed line ) at small image separations .",
    "actually , however , this result can be easly explained : at small mass - end ( corresponding to small image separation ) , the comoving number density for phj mf is much larger than that for sis halos ( figure [ mf ] ) , which results in the corresponding lensing probabilities according to equation ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "this is why in our previous work @xcite , we calculated the amplification bias based on the magnification of the second bright image rather than the total magnification of the two images considered . according to the resolution of class / jvas ,",
    "however , it is difficult to resolve the two images for small image separations . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we calculate the amplification bias based on the total magnification of the outer two brighter images , as usually done in the literature .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt another most recent mass function , fontana gsmf ( figure [ prob_fontana ] ) , we find that the predicted lensing probabilities in an open teves cosmology with the `` simple '' interpolating function @xmath2 [ i.e. , @xmath60 in equation ( [ ap ] ) ] match the observational data of class / jvas quite well .",
    "similarly , this is reasonable when we note that the comoving number density of galaxies for phj gsmf is much higher than that for fontana gsmf at small mass - end ( figure 1 ) .",
    "clearly , the `` standard '' interpolating function @xmath54 [ i.e. , @xmath61 in equation ( [ ap ] ) ] is ruled out due to its too low lensing rates at small image separations .",
    "interestingly , this conclusion is in agreement with the most recent result of sanders and noordermeer @xcite , who constrained the interpolating function with the rotation curves of early - type disc galaxies .",
    "c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c & & & lcdm & class / jvas + & n=1.5&n=2.0&n=3.0&p=0.0&p=0.35 & & + phj & -2.460 & -2.513 & -2.552 & -2.601 & -2.691&-2.848&-2.838 + fontana&-2.873&-2.926 & -2.965&-3.021&-3.112 & & +    in our calculations for deflection angle in teves cosmology , we have fixed the value of the critical acceleration @xmath177 and modeled the lensing galaxies with the hernquist profile , and the only free choice is the interpolating function @xmath50 .",
    "we note that the phj gsmf includes all types of galaxies , whereas the mf for sis halos includes only early - type galaxies , this can partly explain the relativey low abundance of sis halos compared with phj gsmf in figure 1 .",
    "on the other hand , fontana gsmf , like phj gsmf , also includes all types of galaxies , but its value is close to ( when @xmath17 ) or lower ( for high @xmath24 ) than the mf for sis halos .",
    "therefore , the major uncertainty for lensing probability arises from the gsmf , which is independent of any gravitational theory and should be determined by observational data .",
    "can we conclude from figure 2 and figure 3 that fontana gsmf is preferred and phj gsmf is ruled out ? recall that , in lcdm cosmology , there are also uncertainties for the mass function derived from the luminosity function , the equation ( [ sis ] ) @xcite . actually , the parameters we adopted in equation ( [ sis ] ) , @xmath171 @xcite , are selected so that the predicted lensing probabilities @xmath178 can exactly match the observed value @xmath179 , i.e. , @xmath180 , see table 1 . the most recent parameters derived from sdss dr3 @xcite",
    "is @xmath181 , however , this will not affect our results .",
    "one can see clearly from figure 2 that , at larger image separations , the predicted lensing probabilities ( dashed line ) are well bellow the observed values , i.e. , @xmath182 . as a matter of fact , in strong lensing statistics , one usually compares the predicted cumulate lensing probability at the image separation of @xmath183 , and regards the under - estimates at larger image - separations to be unimportant .",
    "we note , however , that there is an inflexion at @xmath184 for @xmath174 calculated from the well - defined sample of class / jvas ( thick histogram ) , and there are no physical interpretations for the flat part of the line when @xmath185 .",
    "although the sample of class / jvas is ",
    "well - defined \" , this should not include each detail such as the inflexion , and other observations , like @xcite , would provide more information at @xmath185 .",
    "so we can reasonably guess that the correct observational data should avoid the inflexion , and the trend of the rising probabilities with smaller and smaller image - separations should continue inward at @xmath185 . in this sense ,",
    "the predicted lensing probabilities in teves cosmology , with a phj gsmf and the  standard \" interpolating function , match the observational data quite well as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we also note that , in figure 3 , the lensing probabilities in gr cosmology ( with no dm , dotted lines ) are much lower than the observational data .",
    "this imply that , as an alternative to cdm , mond can sufficiently account for the strong lensing observations .",

    "<S> we compare our results with both the predicted probabilities for lenses by singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) galaxy halos in lcdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) with schechter - fit velocity function , and the observational results of the well defined combined sample of cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) and jodrell bank / very large array astrometric survey ( jvas ) . </S>",
