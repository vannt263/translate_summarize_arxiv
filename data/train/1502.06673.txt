    "domain growth and coarsening dynamics have been studied in a wide variety of systems @xcite . when a system is quenched from a disordered phase to an ordered phase",
    ", the long - range order does not arise immediately . at first , locally - ordered small domains arise , which then grow with time to make global order through domain coarsening .",
    "although there are different mechanisms to cause domain growth , in most cases , domain size @xmath1 grows with time @xmath2 as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an scaling exponent .",
    "for example , @xmath5 in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) conserved systems described by the ising model ( e.g. , binary alloys and ferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy )  @xcite .",
    "if fluid flow contributes to domain growth , which is the case of binary fluids , the exponent changes depending on advection and viscosity . when the advective transport is negligible , diffusion dominates the coarsening dynamics . in that case , @xmath5  @xcite , which is the same as in the absence of flow .",
    "however , if the advective transport with little viscosity dominates over diffusion , the inertia of fluid becomes important in the coarsening dynamics . in this case , domains grow faster than the diffusive case , and the exponent is @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "when the system is described by vector fields ( i.e. , complex order parameters or multi - component order parameters ) , the dominant mechanism to cause domain growth is completely different from those for the ising model and binary fluids .",
    "for example , the coarsening dynamics for 2d vector fields is driven by the annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs",
    ". the domain size , which is actually the characteristic length of the spatial structure of the field , grows as @xmath7 for non - conserved @xmath8-component vector fields in @xmath9-dimensional space , except for @xmath10 , namely , the 2d @xmath0 model .",
    "the domain growth law for the 2d @xmath0 model includes a logarithmic correction : @xmath11  @xcite .    magnetic domain patterns and their coarsening dynamics",
    "are observed also in ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "recent development in imaging techniques to observe magnetization profiles in ferromagnetic becs has enabled us to investigate the real - time dynamics of magnetization , such as spin texture formation , spin - domain coarsening , and nucleation of spin vortices  @xcite .",
    "those experiments have also motivated theoretical studies about configurations of skyrmions and spin textures  @xcite , magnetic domain formation  @xcite , and spin turbulence  @xcite .",
    "magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnetic bec depends on the quadratic zeeman energy , which can be controlled by external fields .",
    "when the quadratic zeeman energy is negative , longitudinal magnetization is dominant , and thus the system is similar to the ising model . in 2d ferromagnetic becs with a negative quadratic zeeman energy or binary becs , domain size grows as @xmath12  @xcite , which has the same exponent @xmath6 as that for binary fluids in the inertial hydrodynamic regime .",
    "however , @xmath13 in the absence of superfluid flow  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the exponents suggests that the superfluid flow has a strong influence on the coarsening dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the coarsening dynamics in 2d spin-@xmath14 ferromagnetic becs with a positive quadratic zeeman energy . when the quadratic zeeman energy is positive , transverse magnetization is dominant , and the coarsening dynamics is caused by vortex - antivortex annihilation .",
    "the situation is similar to the 2d @xmath0 model , however a crucial difference arises in the classification of vortices . vortices in ferromagnetic becs are classified by the winding number of spin current ( direction of magnetization ) and mass current ( vorticity of superfluid flow ) . thus , there are several combinations of vortex - antivortex pairs which cause pair annihilation in ferromagnetic becs . by contrast , in the @xmath0 model , there is only one combination of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "when several combinations of annihilation pairs exist , the coarsening dynamics is expected to be more complicated than that of the @xmath0 model . in other words ,",
    "superfluid flow has indirect effects on the coarsening dynamics through different combinations of vortex - antivortex annihilation .",
    "we will demonstrate the coarsening dynamics in ferromagnetic becs by numerical simulations , and propose a revised domain growth law , based on the growth law for the @xmath0 model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the decay of the vortex density , which is caused by vortex - antivortex annihilation , in ferromagnetic becs is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : law ] .",
    "numerical simulations illustrated in sec .  [ sec : simu ] clearly show that superfluid flow affects the coarsening dynamics and that a revised growth law is needed for the case where there are several combinations of vortex - antivortex pairs .",

    "we consider a spin-1 bec confined in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane under a uniform magnetic field applied in the @xmath17 direction . for simplicity , we neglect the confining potential in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions . the mean - field kinetic energy and zeeman energy",
    "are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the condensate wave function for the atoms in the magnetic sublevel @xmath20 , @xmath21 is an atomic mass , and @xmath22 is the quadratic zeeman energy per atom . here , we neglected the linear zeeman term because the linear zeeman effect merely induces the larmor precession of atomic spins and can be eliminated in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "the quadratic zeeman energy is tunable by means of a linearly polarized microwave field and can take both positive and negative values  @xcite .",

    "the interaction coefficients are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-wave scattering lengths of two colliding atoms with total spin @xmath31 channel .",
    "for the condensate to be stable , @xmath32 needs to be positive . on the other hand ,",
    "the sign of @xmath33 determines the magnetism : the condensate is ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic or polar ) for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider ferromagnetic becs ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "when the quadratic zeeman energy is weak compared with the ferromagnetic interaction energy , the condensate is fully magnetized ( @xmath36 ) . since the order parameter for a fully - magnetized state in the direction @xmath37",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath38 the population in the @xmath39 component becomes maximum at @xmath40 , whereas those in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components become maximum at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "as seen from eq .  , the quadratic zeeman effect enhances the population in the @xmath39 state for @xmath45 and those in the @xmath46 states for @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the magnetization arises in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath45 , and in the @xmath48 or @xmath49 direction ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) for @xmath47 .",
    "the former case corresponds to the @xmath0 model and the latter the ising model of the conventional ferromagnet .",
    "although the magnitude of the spontaneous magnetization becomes smaller when the quadratic zeeman energy is positive and comparable to the ferromagnetic interaction , the magnetization direction is still confined in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane . since we are interested in vortex - antivortex annihilation , we consider @xmath45 below .",
    "we first consider a single vortex and write its wave function in the polar coordinate whose origin is the center of the vortex core : @xmath50 .",
    "we take @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq .  , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are integers . for a symmetric vortex",
    ", @xmath55 is a function of @xmath56 and independent of @xmath57 . at a distance from the vortex core , @xmath40 as discussed in the above .",
    "the wave function outside of the core is approximately written as @xmath58 here , @xmath53 and @xmath54 determine the directions of mass flow and spin flow around the vortex , respectively .",
    "the superfluid velocity ( mass flow ) and the spin superfluid velocity ( spin flow ) of @xmath17 component are written for a homogeneous @xmath59 as @xmath60/ n_{\\rm tot } ,   \\label{eq : vmass } \\\\",

    "substituting eq .   into eqs .   and , we see that the directions of mass and spin flows depend on @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the combination of @xmath53 and @xmath54 also determines the vortex core structure . though we use @xmath40 in eq .  , @xmath55 changes around the center of the vortex so as to remove the singularity of the order parameter .",
    "when @xmath63 , the @xmath41 component is independent of @xmath57 and only this component remains at @xmath64 . in this case , @xmath55 takes @xmath65 at @xmath64 , which means the magnetization at the center is in the @xmath48 direction for @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , for vortices with @xmath66 , magnetization is in the @xmath49 direction at the center .",
    "when @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath57-dependent components can not vanish in a fully - magnetized state .",
    "thus , magnetization vanishes at the center for @xmath67 . on the other hand , when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , all three components should vanish at the center . in the following ,",
    "we consider only the elementary vortices that are stable against splitting , that is , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the vortex of @xmath67 has no mass flow around itself and its core is not magnetized .",
    "such a vortex is called polar - core vortex ( pcv ) . when @xmath73 , the vortex has mass flow around its core and its core is fully magnetized as well as the outside .",
    "such a vortex is called mermin - ho vortex ( mhv ) . considering the combination of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ", we notice that there are two kinds of pcvs [ @xmath74 and four kinds of mhvs [ @xmath75 .",
    "a vortex - antivortex pair is defined so that they can be pair - annihilated . for the case of a single - component bec , two vortices with winding numbers with the opposite signs are a vortex - antivortex pair . in the present case ,",
    "i.e. , a multi - component bec , when two vortices have winding numbers with the opposite signs in all components , they can be annihilated as a vortex - antivortex pair . for the vortex expressed by eq .  , the @xmath41 , @xmath65 , and @xmath42 components have the winding numbers @xmath76 , @xmath53 , and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "vortices belonging to different groups can not cause annihilation with each other . when the groups of vortex density @xmath220 and @xmath221 are mixed and coexist in the same space , we rewrite the total vortex density @xmath222 as @xmath223 where @xmath224 represents a typical vortex density of a group and is supposed to obey the original scaling eq .  , and @xmath225 corresponds to the difference between the expected and actual vortex densities .",

    "this means @xmath246 in the absence of superfluid flow .",

    "we have considered only mhvs in this paper .",
    "the coarsening dynamics becomes different and even faster in the cases of pcvs and one - component becs than in the case of mhvs .",
    "since some of the assumptions made in this paper are invalid for pcvs and one - component becs , the growth laws in those cases should be different from that of the @xmath0 model or our revised one .",
    "we will present the study about those cases somewhere else .    in conclusion ,",
    "the coarsening dynamics in ferromagnetic becs with a positive quadratic zeeman energy , in which magnetic anisotropy is similar to the @xmath0 model , leads to a different domain growth law from that of the @xmath0 model .",
    "we have proposed a revised growth law especially for the case where only mhvs exist .",
    "when several groups of vortex - antivortex pairs coexist in the same space , the difference in vortex densities of them leads to the revised growth law . in the absence of the superfluid flow , where there is only one combination of vortex - antivortex pairs ,",
    "the growth law is the same as that of the @xmath0 model , and the coarsening dynamics is slower than in the presence of the flow .",
    "the effect of the superfluid flow is not only accelerating domain growth but also producing several combinations of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
