    "the ages and metallicities of stellar populations in nearby galaxies are direct tracers of the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the universe .",
    "clues to the ages and metallicities of the stars may be inferred from the integrated spectra of galaxies , using ` stellar population synthesis models ' @xcite .",
    "analyses based on these models have been traditionally limited by the difficulty of deriving independent constraints on the age , star formation history , metallicity and dust content of a galaxy .",
    "for example , changes in age , metallicity and attenuation by dust all have similar effects on the colours and low - resolution spectra of galaxies .",
    "this gives rise to well - known ` near - degeneracies ' in the constraints derived on these different parameters .",
    "the expectation is that these degeneracies may be broken , at least in part , by appealing to refined spectral diagnostics which are not sensitive to attenuation by dust and have different sensitivities to age and metallicity .",
    "studies in this area have focused on a set of 25 absorption features defined and calibrated in the spectra of 460 nearby galactic stars obtained at lick observatory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies all pertain to early - type galaxies , because the lack of hot stars in the lick library does not allow the spectral interpretation of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the conclusion from these studies is that , for early - type galaxies , comparisons of the strengths of metallic lines and age - sensitive balmer lines _ can _ break the age - metallicity degeneracy , but only in a relative way : the derived ages and metallicities appear to depend strongly on the specific choice of metal indices ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the galactic stars used to calibrate the lick indices have approximately solar metal abundance ratios at any metallicity , whereas the ratio of @xmath0-elements to iron is seen to increase from dwarf to massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a main weakness of the original calibration of lick indices is that it relies on spectra which were not calibrated in flux , and for which the resolution ( @xmath2  fwhm ) is three times lower than achieved by modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the high - quality spectra from these surveys must be degraded to the calibration and resolution of the original lick spectra for index - strength analyses to be performed .",
    "the situation has changed recently with the development of medium - high resolution ( @xmath3  fwhm ) , flux - calibrated population synthesis models including stars in the full temperature range @xcite .",
    "these models can be compared directly to high - quality observed spectra of both early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "several studies have also quantified the sensitivity of stellar absorption features to changes in element abundance ratios in galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "these developments coincide with the advent of large homogeneous samples of galaxy spectra gathered by modern surveys such as the sdss .",
    "this is the first paper of a series in which we combine modern population synthesis techniques with the statistical power of the sdss to investigate the connection between metallicity , age and stellar mass in nearby galaxies . here",
    ", we use the medium - high resolution population synthesis code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) to derive estimates of the metallicities , ages and stellar masses of a sample of @xmath4 nearby galaxies from the sdss data release two ( dr2 ) .",
    "we adopt a bayesian statistical approach and derive full likelihood distributions for these physical parameters by comparing the observed spectrum of each galaxy with a comprehensive library of model spectra corresponding to different star formation histories .",
    "the comparison is driven by the strengths of 5 spectral features selected to depend only weakly on the @xmath0/fe ratio , which we measure in the same way in model and observed spectra .",
    "an important specificity of our work is that we derive the above constraints not only for quiescent , early - type galaxies , but also for late - type , star - forming galaxies , for which the contamination of stellar absorption features by nebular emission must be removed .",
    "we explore the relationships between metallicity , age and stellar mass and the dependence of these relationships on galaxy structure . in a companion paper",
    ", we exploit these results to investigate the physical origin of the colour - magnitude relation and of the relation between @xmath5-index strength and velocity dispersion for early - type galaxies .",
    "the total metal content of the local universe and the distribution of metals as a function of galaxy properties will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ approach ]",
    "below , we present our sample of sdss spectra and the models used to interpret them .",
    "we also describe our method for deriving metallicities , ages and stellar masses from observed galaxy spectra .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] , where we study the dependence of metallicity and age on total stellar mass and the age - metallicity relation as a function of galaxy structure .",
    "we also address in that section the influence of aperture bias on our derived parameters .",
    "we summarize and briefly discuss our results in section [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we describe our approach for deriving estimates of light - weighted ages and metallicities from the observed spectra of sdss galaxies .",
    "these spectra are discussed in section [ spectra ] , along with the models we use to interpret them . in section",
    "[ measure ] , we select a set of spectral absorption features which we argue should most robustly constrain age and metallicity",
    ". then , in section [ method ] , we outline the statistical approach we adopt to derive ages and metallicities from galaxy spectra .",
    "we also highlight the sensitivity of our constraints on age and metallicity to the observational signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectra .",
    "the observed spectra we consider are drawn from the sdss dr2 @xcite .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the high galactic latitude sky , which will obtain @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 photometry of almost a quarter of the sky and spectra of at least 700,000 objects @xcite .",
    "the spectra are taken using 3-diameter fibres , positioned as close as possible to the centres of the target galaxies .",
    "the flux- and wavelength - calibrated spectra cover the range from 3800 to 9200  with a resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "our sample , drawn from the sdss dr2 , includes unique spectra of 196,673 galaxies with petrosian @xmath8-band magnitudes in the range @xmath12 ( after correction for foreground galactic extinction using the extinction maps of @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies span the full range of types , from actively star - forming , late - type galaxies to dormant , early - type galaxies .",
    "the median redshift is 0.13 .",
    "a more detailed description of this sample is given in section [ results ] below .    to interpret these observed spectra in terms of physical parameters such as age , metallicity and stellar mass",
    ", we use the recent population synthesis models of bc03 .",
    "these models are based on ` stelib ' , a newly available library of observed stellar spectra assembled by @xcite .",
    "the models have a spectral resolution of 3  fwhm across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 .",
    "they are thus ideally matched to the sdss spectra .",
    "we note that , to interpret the spectra of star - forming and active galaxies with these models , we must first remove the contamination of the observed spectra by nebular emission lines .",
    "this is achieved using the procedure outlined by @xcite , which is optimized for use with sdss galaxy spectra ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this consists in performing first a non - negative least - squares fit of the emission - line - free regions of the observed spectrum , using a set of model template spectra broadened to the observed velocity dispersion ( the template spectra correspond to 30 instantaneous - burst models of different ages and metallicities computed using the bc03 code ) .",
    "once the fitted spectrum is subtracted from the observed spectrum , the residuals can be fitted to gaussian - broadened emission - line templates .",
    "the method assumes a single broadening width for all the balmer lines , and another ( independent ) width for all the forbidden lines .",
    "the strength of each line is fitted independently .",
    "then , the fitted emission lines are subtracted from the original observed spectrum to produce a ` pure ' absorption - line spectrum suited to our analysis .",
    "the strongest stellar absorption features in the optical spectra of galaxies form the basis of the lick system of spectral indices ( @xcite ; see also section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "each index in this system is defined by a central ` feature bandpass ' and two adjacent ` pseudo - continuum bandpasses ' .",
    "the above studies have shown that some lick indices are primarily sensitive to age , such as those based on h - balmer lines , while others are primarily sensitive to metallicity , such as several fe- and mg - based indices at wavelengths between 4500 and 5700 .",
    "we also consider here the 4000-  break index of @xcite , which we denote , which is defined as the ratio of the average flux densities in the narrow bands 40004100   and 38503950   .. ] this index depends somewhat on metallicity but correlates more with the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates in galaxies ( see fig .  2 of @xcite and fig .",
    "27 of @xcite ) .    in previous studies based on models with low spectral resolution , the strengths of lick indices had to be modelled analytically as functions of the effective temperatures , gravities and metallicities of the stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "these ` fitting functions ' were not appropriate for hot stars , and hence , index - strength analyses had to be restricted to old stellar populations . moreover , as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , the stellar spectra on which the lick indices were originally calibrated had lower resolution than typical galaxy spectra today and were not flux - calibrated .",
    "these various weaknesses are resolved here by our adoption of the medium - high resolution , flux - calibrated bc03 models .",
    "these models can be compared directly to the sdss spectra of galaxies with any star formation history , and the lick indices can be measured in the same way in model and observed spectra .    like previous models , however , the bc03 models rely on a spectral library of nearby stars with near solar metal abundance ratios at any metallicity .",
    "the models are therefore expected to show discrepancies when compared to galaxies where the abundance ratios differ from those of nearby stars.the abundance ratio of @xmath0 elements ( such as n , o , mg , ca , na , ne , s , si , ti ) , which are produced mainly by type ii supernovae , to fe - peak elements ( such as cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn ) , which are produced mainly by type ia supernovae , is observed to vary in external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "] in fact , such discrepancies appear to be responsible for the fact that some spectral features , such as cn@xmath13 , cn@xmath14 , tio@xmath13 , tio@xmath14 , ca4227 and several mg and fe lines , were not well reproduced when bc03 compared their models with a sample of high - quality galaxy spectra drawn from sdss early data release @xcite .",
    "several studies have addressed the dependence of lick index strengths on changes in the relative ratios of heavy elements ( * ? ? ?",

    "these studies have led to the identification of composite mg+fe indices , which are sensitive to metallicity ( i.e. the fraction by mass of all elements heavier than helium over the total gas mass ) but show little sensitivity to @xmath0/fe ( i.e. the ratio of the total mass of @xmath0 elements to the mass of iron ; see footnote  [ alphafe ] ) . among these",

    "we wish to extract ages and metallicities from the sdss galaxy spectra .",
    "we therefore fit simultaneously both metal - sensitive and age - sensitive indices . among the 28 spectral indices studied by bc03 , we concentrate on those that are best reproduced by the models .",
    "this requirement already excludes several fe - based indices , the three mg - based indices , ca4227 , ca4455 , the cn , tio and nad features ( see fig .",
    "18 of bc03 ) . among the remaining indices we identify those that are known to have at most a weak dependence on @xmath0/fe .  and",
    "are suitable metal - sensitive indices and  is a suitable age - sensitive index .",
    "we also include , which is sensitive to the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rate ( see above ) .",
    "we are not aware of any study indicating the dependence of this index on @xmath0/fe . finally , to better constrain age we decided to include also the two higher - order balmer lines , h@xmath17 and h@xmath18 .",
    "these indices have been recently shown to depend on variations in element abundance ratios at metallicities around solar and above @xcite . however , we find that including them in our procedure does not produce results systematically different from those obtained without them , while it provides smaller errors on both age and metallicity estimates .",
    "therefore , we decide to use also .",
    "we choose the sum of h@xmath17 and h@xmath18 because it is better reproduced by the models than the two indices separately ( see fig .",
    "18 of bc03 ) .",
    "thus , our final set of indices is composed of , , ,  and .",
    "this is the minimum set that allows us to derive good constraints on metallicity and age simultaneously and to recover well the parameters of simulated galaxies ( see section  [ accuracy ] below ) .",
    "the solid histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show the distributions in ` resolving power ' of these five spectral features for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the resolving power is defined as the ratio between the 595 percent percentile range of the distribution of index strengths for all galaxies in the sample , @xmath19 , and the observational error for each galaxy , @xmath20 .",
    "the resolving power is largest ( @xmath21 ) for  and slightly lower ( @xmath22 ) for the other indices .",
    "also shown as dotted histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are the analogous distributions in resolving power for a subsample of galaxies with mean signal - to - noise per pixel greater than 20 .",
    "as expected , the distributions for these galaxies are shifted to higher values , because of the smaller observational errors .",
    "we note that the strengths of some spectral absorption indices are sensitive to the stellar velocity dispersion in a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the indices that are most affected are those measured with the narrowest pseudo - continuum bandpass definitions . in particular this effect is seen in fe - based indices and therefore also in the composite mg+fe indices .",
    "the bc03 population synthesis code provides ssp spectra broadened to different velocity dispersions .",
    "this allows us to compare each galaxy spectra with models that have a similar velocity dispersion ( see section  [ method ] ) .",
    "we wish to estimate not only the most likely values of the ages and metallicities of sdss galaxies , but also the accuracy of these values . to this purpose",
    ", we adopt a bayesian statistical approach , similar to the one outlined by @xcite .",
    "the goal is to obtain the likelihood distribution of a given parameter @xmath23 in the space of all possible values of @xmath23 .",
    "this is obtained by comparing the observational data with a set of models that populate the space of all possible @xmath23 according to a prior distribution which represents our prejudice about the relative likelihood of different @xmath23 values in absence of any data .",
    "we generate a library of 150,000 monte carlo realizations of a full range of physically plausible star formation histories .",

    "the bursts can occur at all times after @xmath24 with equal probability , set in such a way that 10 percent of the galaxies in the library experience a burst in the last 2 gyr .. ] they are parametrized in terms of the fraction @xmath28 of stellar mass produced during the burst relative to the total mass formed by the continuous model .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows the distribution of the differences between the best - fit and observed strengths of each index , in units of the observational error , for the galaxies in our sample .",

    "there is no strong correlation between the residuals of the different indices .",
    "the comparison of the strengths of , , ,  and  in the spectrum of an observed sdss galaxy with the strengths of these indices in every model spectrum in the library allows us to construct the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of physical parameters ( such as age , metallicity and mass - to - light ratio ) for that galaxy .",
    "this is achieved by assigning to each model a weight @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is calculated by comparing the strengths of the 5 indices measured in the observed spectrum with those measured in the model spectrum , given the observational measurement errors .",
    "the pdf of a selected physical parameter is then simply given by the distribution in that parameter of the weights @xmath43 of all the models in the library .",
    "the pdf of a given parameter can then be characterized by its mode , which corresponds to the most likely value of the parameter , its median , which can differ from the mode for non - symmetric distributions , and by a confidence interval within which the parameter is constrained at a certain probability level .",
    "we often quote below the 68 percent confidence interval corresponding to the 16%84% percentile range of the pdf , which would be equivalent to the @xmath44 range for a gaussian distribution .",
    "we now want to illustrate the kind of constraints that can be obtained on the ages and metallicities of sdss galaxies with different spectral properties using the method outlined above . @xcite",
    "have shown that the combination of h - balmer lines and is a discriminating diagnostic of the recent star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "we therefore draw 4 galaxies from our sample with high - quality spectra ( median s / n per pixel larger than 30 ) located at different positions along the sequence occupied by sdss galaxies in the  versus  diagnostic diagram .    the solid distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show the constraints obtained on the metallicities ( left - hand plot ) and ages ( right - hand plot ) of these galaxies in two cases : when including only the age - sensitive indices ,  and  to constrain the fits ( bottom panels ) , and when including also the metal - sensitive indices and  ( top panels ) .",
    "as expected , the ages are well constrained by ,  and  alone , and the corresponding pdfs do not change appreciably when including also the constraints from metal - sensitive indices .",

    "we note that age and metallicity appear to correlate with   ( indicated on the figure ) for these 4 galaxies , and that the constraints on metallicity are weakest for the galaxy with the lowest .",
    "this is not a coincidence , as we shall see in section  [ results ] below .",
    "it is important to note that the observed s / n directly influences the uncertainties in the age and metallicity estimates . to investigate this",

    "[ fig3 ] , but with lower median s / n per pixel , e.g. 20 .",

    "follow - up observations would be required to understand whether the unusual metallicities and ages of these galaxies are consistent with a substantial recent episode of metal - enriched star formation .",
    "we note that the typical light - weighted age for the massive early - type galaxies in our sample is @xmath658 gyr , which is somewhat younger than the ages usually quoted for ( cluster ) ellipticals .",

    "in particular , the ages usually quoted in the literature are derived by comparing the observed distributions in spectral indices with simple stellar population predictions .",
    "what we quote here is a proper light - weighted age , calculated by weighting the age of each generation of stars by their luminosity along the entire sfh of each model galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , the relatively young ages we find could reflect an environmental dependence , since the sdss sample is composed predominantly of galaxies in lower density regions than those used in most studies of early - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , several studies have reported an age difference between early - type galaxies in clusters and in low - density regions from @xmath651.2 gyr @xcite up to @xmath133 gyr @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the properties of the early - type galaxies in our sample in more detail in the second paper of this series .",
    "a comparison of figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] suggests that the ages and metallicities of late- and early - type galaxies differ primarily at the low - mass end .",
    "low - mass late - type galaxies tend to be younger and more metal - poor than their early - type counterparts ( by about 0.6  dex in both age and metallicity ) .",
    "in contrast , massive late - type galaxies tend to have old ages and high metallicities similar to those of their early - type counterparts , even though there is a tail of young ( @xmath134 yr ) , metal - poor ( @xmath135 ) late - type galaxies with masses greater than @xmath131 in our sample .",
    "the high metallicities of most massive late - type galaxies might reflect the influence of their metal - rich bulges .",
    "this may be enhanced by the fact that the sdss spectra sample only the inner regions of the galaxies ( see section [ aperture ] below ) .",
    "figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] also indicate that the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass discussed in section  [ res2 ] holds for both late - type and early - type galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the relation between age and stellar mass is much more pronounced for late - type galaxies , which cover a significant range in age ( @xmath2 gyr ) .",
    "early - type galaxies do not show such a clear trend , at least above @xmath126 .",
    "this is in agreement with previous findings of no significant relation between the ages of early - type galaxies and luminosity @xcite . at fainter luminosities ,",

    "we also find that the fraction of young early - type galaxies increases at lower stellar masses .",
    "this is true in particular below @xmath136 , reflecting a possible contamination by s0 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we note that for both early - type galaxies and high - mass late - type galaxies , the probability contours of figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] hint at an anticorrelation between age and stellar metallicity , at given mass .",

    "@xcite have recently shown that this transition around @xmath138 can be seen directly from the colour - magnitude relation . moreover",
    ", this mass range seems also to correspond to a shift in gas richness @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , around the same value of stellar mass , there appears to be also a gradual transition in the ages and metallicities of the galaxies .",
    "this transition , which is particularly evident for late - type galaxies , causes the dispersion in age and metallicity to be highest for galaxies of intermediate mass .",
    "we have not mentioned so far the potential influence of the ` age - metallicity degeneracy ' on the results of figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ( see section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy , which arises from the competing effects of age and metallicity on absorption - line strengths , can cause the confusion between old , metal - poor galaxies and young , metal - rich ones @xcite . to address this issue , we first evaluate the slope of the age - metallicity degeneracy from the two - dimensional likelihood distribution of each individual galaxy in our sample .",
    "this is achieved by computing the matrix of second moments of the likelihood distribution ( inside the 68 percent probability contour ) with respect to the median @xmath139 and @xmath140 values .",
    "the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of this matrix defines the slope @xmath141 of the age - metallicity degeneracy . in each panel of figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ]",

    ".      the sdss galaxy spectra on which our analysis is based are taken using 3-diameter fibres , which collect only the light coming from limited inner regions of the galaxies .",
    "we can estimate the fraction of the total galaxy light entering a fibre from the ratio between the fibre flux and the total petrosian flux .",
    "[ fig13 ] shows the distribution of this ratio for the 44,254 high - s /",
    "n galaxies in our sample .",
    "the median value is about 30 percent , and the maximum value about 60 percent .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines show the distributions for low - concentration , late - type galaxies and high - concentration , early - type galaxies , respectively . as expected , the fibre tends to collect a smaller fraction of the total light for low - concentration galaxies than for high - concentration galaxies .",
    "radial gradients in the properties of stellar populations are known to exist for both bulge - dominated @xcite and disk - dominated @xcite galaxies .",
    "thus , aperture effects are a significant concern for our age and metallicity estimates .",
    "fortunately , the distribution of the fraction of total galaxy light that enters an sdss fibre does not vary appreciably with redshift ( except at very low redshift ) , because larger galaxies are also brighter and hence selected out to larger distances .",
    "one way to test for the effects of aperture bias on our results is to compare the ages and metallicities of galaxies of similar luminosity located at different redshifts . because of the presence of both a faint and a bright magnitude cut - off in the sdss survey , this comparison is possible only for galaxies in a limited absolute - luminosity range , if we want to span a reasonably large redshift range .",

    "the vertical bar indicates the median fraction for this sample .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines show the distributions of low - concentration , late - type galaxies and high - concentration , early - type galaxies , respectively . ]    another way to examine the potential effects of aperture bias on our results is to compare the age and metallicity distributions of galaxies with similar properties as a function of @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the minimum of the redshift at which the galaxy reaches the survey faint - magnitude limit and that at which its median s / n per pixel drops below 20 ( we assume poissonian noise , i.e. that the median s / n per pixel scales as the square root of the apparent fibre luminosity ) . with this approach , we can avoid restricting our test to galaxies in a narrow magnitude range .",
    "also , since we are interested in possible effects of aperture bias on trends with galaxy mass , we divide our sample into the same 6 bins of stellar mass as in figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] above .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows the dependence on @xmath157 of the median ( thick line ) and the @xmath108 and @xmath109 percentiles ( thin lines ) of the distributions in stellar metallicity ( left - hand plot ) and age ( right - hand plot ) of the high - s / n galaxies in our sample .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the subsample of 26,003 early - type galaxies , while the dot - dashed lines correspond to the subsample of 5616 late - type galaxies .",
    "for early - type galaxies of different masses , the largest change in median metallicity from one edge of the survey to the other is about 0.2 dex .",
    "this is comparable to the error associated with the metallicity estimates of most galaxies and smaller than the overall metallicity change with galaxy mass ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this variation is also consistent with the metallicity gradient of @xmath144  dex per decade in radius reported by several studies of bulge - dominated galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the largest variation arises for galaxies with intermediate stellar masses , which often have both a prominent bulge and a disk . for disk - dominated , late - type galaxies ,",
    "the trends in median metallicity with @xmath157 are weaker than for early - type galaxies , although the distributions are broader .    the median age of early - type galaxies does not show any significant trend with @xmath157 in any mass range in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier findings of negligible age gradients in such galaxies @xcite .",
    "late - type galaxies of low and intermediate mass show a similar behaviour .",
    "only the most massive late - type galaxies show a significant decrease ( by about 0.2 dex ) in median age as a function of @xmath157 , as expected if age gradients in spiral galaxies are stronger for larger galaxies @xcite .        the occurrence of negative radial age and metallicity gradients in different types of galaxies and the fact that the sdss spectra sample no more than 5060 percent of the total light of a galaxy are likely to cause overestimates of the stellar metallicities and ages of some galaxies in our sample . however , the weak trends in @xmath139 and @xmath159 as a function of @xmath160 in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] suggest that aperture biases are unlikely to have a significant effect on the trends we have found previously for metallicity and age as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we have used a new approach to derive estimates of light - weighted stellar metallicity , age and stellar mass from the optical spectra of a sample of @xmath65 200,000 nearby galaxies ( @xmath161 ) drawn from the sdss dr2 .",
    "our method relies on the comparison of the galaxy spectra to a large library of model spectra at medium - high resolution , based on monte carlo star formation histories spanning the full physically plausible range . extending earlier work by @xcite",
    ", we have adopted a bayesian approach to derive the a posteriori likelihood distribution of each physical parameter by computing the goodness of fit of the observed spectrum for all the models in the library . in practice , we compute only the strengths of a set of carefully selected spectral absorption features .",
    "our analysis shows that stellar absorption features with different sensitivities to age and metallicity must be fitted simultaneously in galaxy spectra to obtain good constraints on both age and metallicity .",
    "we focus on several newly calibrated lick indices and the 4000   break ( see below ) .",
    "the resolution of our models is higher than that used in most previous studies and is well matched to the resolution of the sdss spectra .",
    "this allows us to measure the indices in the same way in model and galaxy spectra , avoiding any loss of information from the observed spectra .",
    "we emphasize that , while most previous studies were restricted to the analysis of old stellar populations , our sample includes galaxies in the full range of star formation activities . for actively star - forming galaxies , the higher resolution of the models",
    "is crucial to separate strong emission lines from the underlying stellar absorption .    using this approach , we are able to constrain stellar metallicity and light - weighted age to within @xmath162 dex for the majority of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "our stellar - mass estimates , determined within less than @xmath116 dex for the whole sample , are in good agreement with those derived by @xcite .",
    "while the uncertainties on the stellar mass are almost independent of galaxy type , we find that , as expected , the smallest errors on age and especially metallicity are obtained for galaxies with the strongest absorption lines .",
    "the estimates we derive of galaxy parameters are affected by limitations of both model and observed spectra .",
    "for example , the models do not include the effects of variations in heavy - element abundance ratios , while systematic deviations from the solar abundance ratios are known to arise in external galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . when estimating metallicity , we therefore consider only those spectral features that have been shown by previous studies to depend negligibly on @xmath0/fe abundance ratio @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of higher - order balmer lines , which may depend on element abundance ratio at high metallicities @xcite , could lead to an overestimate of the metallicity and an underestimate of the age by @xmath650.05 dex for galaxies with non - solar abundance ratios in our sample .",
    "another systematic uncertainty in our metallicity and age estimates comes from the discrepancy between integrated colours and spectral index strengths for supra - solar metallicity models ( the model spectral indices correspond to lower metallicities than the colours ) .",
    "therefore , we expect metallicities inferred using these models to be biased toward high values at high metallicities .",
    "this problem mainly affects massive , early - type galaxies with strong absorption lines .",
    "we have shown that , in addition to these model uncertainties , the signal - to - noise ratio in a galaxy spectrum strongly affects our estimates of age and especially metallicity .",
    "we choose to rely primarily on results for galaxies with median s / n per pixel greater than 20 .",
    "this cut reduces the original sample by about 75 percent and biases our analysis toward high surface brightness , high concentration galaxies .",
    "our main results appear unaffected by this cut in s / n ; including lower - s / n galaxies mainly increases the scatter in the relations we find , because of the larger associated uncertainties on metallicity .",
    "another observational limitation is the small aperture sampled by the sdss spectra .",
    "the fraction of light collected by an sdss fibre depends on the apparent size of the target galaxy , and this fraction is less than 30 percent for most galaxies in our sample .",
    "the stellar mass we derive from the spectrum has been scaled to the total luminosity of the galaxy , and hence , it represents the total stellar mass of that galaxy .",
    "however , the age and the metallicity derived from the fibre spectrum can not be easily extrapolated to total values without information about radial gradients .",
    "we have shown that these two parameters vary weakly as a function of the fraction of light entering the fibre .",
    "this reassures us that aperture bias does not have a major effect on the relations between metallicity , age and stellar mass that we derive .",
    "we have explored how galaxies are distributed in metallicity , age and stellar mass in the diagram defined by 4000-  break and balmer - line strength . as shown by @xcite the principal sequence in this plane reflects an increase in present to past - averaged star formation rate with decreasing  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies with particularly strong balmer absorption at given  have undergone recent starbursts . by including metallicity dependence in the modelling , we have shown that :    * in this diagram , the average stellar mass increases along the sequence populated by galaxies in our sample , from less than @xmath97 to more than @xmath83 from end to end of the sequence .",
    "the transition at intermediate  is smooth between the two regimes .",
    "these results are in agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "* both stellar metallicity and light - weighted age also increase with .",
    "galaxies with particularly strong balmer absorption at intermediate 4000-  breaks ( @xmath163 ) are on average younger and more metal - rich than the bulk of the sequence .",
    "this supports the idea that these galaxies may have recently undergone a burst of metal - enriched star formation .",
    "in addition , we have constructed the conditional distributions of metallicity and age estimates as a function of stellar mass .",
    "this analysis shows that :    * both stellar metallicity and light - weighted age increase with stellar mass , the increase being rapid at intermediate masses . at masses above @xmath164",
    ", a gradual flattening occurs in both relations .",
    "this stellar mass corresponds to the transition mass identified by @xcite in plots of , surface mass density and concentration against stellar mass . * despite the above clear relations , metallicity and age are not uniquely determined by mass ; there is an intrinsic scatter in both relations , which is largest at stellar masses around @xmath105 .",
    "this scatter persists even when considering low- and high - concentration galaxies separately . *",
    "the relation we find between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to that found by @xcite between gas - phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass .",
    "we confirm that higher stellar metallicities are indeed associated with higher gas - phase metallicities",
    ". however , the relation between stellar and gas - phase metallicities has a substantial scatter , which can only partly be attributed to the uncertainties in stellar - metallicity estimates .",
    "this suggests that a simple ` closed - box ' scenario is not sufficient to explain the relation , and that a variety of gas accretion / ejection histories may be required .",
    "we have also explored relationships between metallicity , age and stellar mass for separate subsamples of high - concentration , early - type and low - concentration , late - type galaxies .",
    "the distribution in age - metallicity space in bins of stellar mass shows that ( figs  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) :    * relations between stellar metallicity , age and stellar mass hold for both early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "however , the age range of the sample is less mass - dependent for early - type than for late - type galaxies .",
    "* at masses below @xmath136 , late - type galaxies are younger and more metal - poor than early - type galaxies . at masses above @xmath165",
    "the metallicities and ages of late - type galaxies are similar to those of early - type galaxies .",
    "the above results indicate that young , metal - poor stellar populations are found predominantly in low - mass galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with a ` downsizing ' scenario , in which the mass and luminosity of the galaxies undergoing active star formation become progressively lower as the universe becomes older @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , this would imply that the low metallicities of low - mass galaxies just reflect the fact that these galaxies have had less time to produce metals .",
    "this naive conclusion is not consistent with that of @xcite , who showed that the effective yields ( from indirect gas - mass fraction measurements ) of low - mass , star - forming galaxies in the sdss dr2 are too low for these galaxies to be interpreted as young closed - box systems .",
    "this led @xcite to favor galatic winds as the most likely origin of the relation between gas - phase metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "this interpretation is supported here by the fact that galaxies with no  emission in our sample ( which have presumably completed their star formation ) also show a trend of decreasing stellar metallicity with decreasing stellar mass for @xmath166 ( the metallicity of closed - box galaxies should tend to the yield near gas exhaustion , independently of mass ) . the large scatter present in all relations between stellar metallicity ,",
    "age and stellar mass ( even when separated into late - type and early - type galaxies ) further indicates that stellar mass is not the unique parameter determining the star formation history and hence the physical parameters of present - day galaxies .",
    "additional variations in star formation and enrichment history ( e.g. driven by gas infall or outflow ) are required to explain these parameters .",
    "an advantage of the large samples available from the sdss is that they allow us to study not only the mean relations between physical parameters of galaxies , but also the dependence of these parameters on various galaxy properties .",
    "our results are particularly useful for studying the physical origin of well - known observed relations , such as for example the colour - magnitude relation and the relation between @xmath5-index strength and velocity dispersion for early - type galaxies .",
    "our analysis also enables us to estimate the total metal content of the local universe and the distribution of these metals over different galaxy types .",
    "we will address these questions in forthcoming papers .",
    "a complete census of the physical parameters of galaxies out to @xmath167 is essential for constraining models of the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies .",
