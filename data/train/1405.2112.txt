    "the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) opened a new window for the studies on diffraction , elastic and inelastic scattering as they are not strongly contaminated by non - diffractive events .",
    "this is translated in the regge theory language saying that the scattering amplitude is completely determined by a pomeron exchange .",
    "the current measurements on the single and double diffraction at the lhc in proton - proton collisions are in very good shape , covering the energies of 0.9 tev @xcite , 2.76 tev @xcite and 7 tev @xcite . as a general aspect , they are compatible with several available theoretical models . on the other hand , dissociation processes in which nuclei are the diffractively excited objects are far to be easily understood .",
    "the experimental constraints in these cases are given by low energy fixed - target experiments @xcite and it was found that measured target - diffraction cross sections have quite distinct atomic mass dependences when different beam particles are considered ( @xmath4 ) . in general , in those experiments",
    "only the single diffractive dissociation of the target nucleus ( tsd ) , @xmath5 , is measured . from theoretical point of view , the tsd cross section at high energies is a fraction of the quasi - elastic scattering cross section , i.e. the process @xmath6 where the nucleus is excited .",
    "the theoretical understanding is still unclear as the dual parton model @xcite overestimates the helios data .",
    "a more optimistic approach is given by ref .",
    "@xcite where the diffractive dissociation in nuclei in proton - nucleus and meson - nucleus collisions is analyzed and it is able to explain the different atomic mass dependences as measured by helios @xcite and ehs / na22 @xcite with the effect of using distinct beam hadrons . finally , in refs .",
    "@xcite the cross sections for a variety of diffractive processes in proton - nucleus ( @xmath7 ) are computed within the glauber - gribov theory , where inelastic shadowing corrections are summed to all orders by using the dipole representation .",
    "their predictions overestimate the hera - b data around 30 % in the case of tsd cross section .",
    "thus , an analysis on the tsd cross section in the lhc regime is quite timely .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the single diffractive dissociation of the target nucleus ( tsd ) at the lhc energies in proton - lead collisions .",
    "we think this is quite relevant for the diffraction physics groups at lhc collaborations . the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we summarize the theoretical information to compute the differential cross section @xmath8 as a function of center of mass energy , @xmath9 , and atomic number , @xmath10 . in section [ discuss ]",
    "we present the numerical calculations and discuss the main theoretical uncertainties and a comparison to other approaches is done .",
    "we cross check the consistency of phenomenological approach against the low energy fixed target experiments on proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "finally , we show the main conclusions .",
    "let us summarize the main expressions related to the theoretical approach to be used in the current analysis .",
    "the invariant cross section of a process of the type @xmath11 for hadron - proton collisions is written as @xmath12 where @xmath2 is the invariant mass of diffractively excited system .",
    "often , in literature one uses the variable @xmath13 to describe such process . in the regge theory , in the single pole approximation , the single - diffractive cross section for producing a high - mass system , @xmath14 , is dominated by the triple - regge diagrams . at very high energies ,",
    "the process is dominated by the ( @xmath15 and ( @xmath16 terms .",
    "the later , dominates the process at very low mass and vanishes at higher masses . the single diffractive cross section , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , is then expressed in terms of the triple regge limit @xcite and we take into account the dominant one , ( @xmath15 .",
    "we notice that the rich resonance structure in the low mass region is ignored in present work ( for details on the complete treatment of low @xmath14 region see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", the approach is supplemented by a phenomenological procedure in order to take into account corrections that guarantee unitarity @xcite : @xmath17 where the function @xmath18 is the _",
    "renormalized _ pomeron flux factor .",
    "a comment is in order here : it is well known that the unitarity bound can be easily broken in regge models with the pomeron intercept above unity , and that unitarity , or absorption corrections , restore it .",
    "these correction have been studied in numerous works for the total and diffractive cross section .",
    "we have chosen the ad hoc parametrisation of ref .",
    "@xcite for its simplicity and easy numerical implementation .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , this flux is constructed based on the the _ standard _ flux factor given by the donnachie - landshoff expression @xcite , @xmath19 .",

    "the _ standard _ flux factor is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) putting @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 @xmath25 is the hadron - pomeron coupling at the quasi - elastic vertices ( see ref .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the hadron form factor , in general modeled for proton case by the dirac form factor .",
    "the pomeron - proton cross section , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , is written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xmath25 and the pomeron trajectory @xmath29 . in our numerical calculation",
    "we take @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 as obtained in ref .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) in the experimental limits for @xmath34 and @xmath14 variables .    concerning diffraction in nuclear collisions ,",
    "the invariant cross section for the reaction @xmath35 is expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath36 where the distribution @xmath37 is generated by a recurrence formula using the assumption @xcite : @xmath38    the quantity @xmath39 is the partial inelastic cross section resulting of @xmath40 interactions , which is written in terms of the probability , @xmath41 , of a nucleon to suffer an inelastic interaction at a given impact parameter @xmath42 : @xmath43^{a - m } , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is expressed in terms of the nuclear density , @xmath44 , @xmath45    concerning the nuclear densities , for light nuclei ( @xmath46 ) we have used a gaussian distribution with the width properly adjusted to the radius . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and the half - density radius adjusted to @xmath49 fm . for heavier nuclei ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is calculated according to the woods - saxon formula @xcite . for the inelastic cross sections @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) we have considered the parameterization presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes properly the accelerator data .",
    "when only diffractive events are taken into account , it is enough to put @xmath53 as these processes are supposed to take place through single peripheral interactions with the outlying nucleons @xcite .",
    "the last factor in square brackets in eq . ( [ eq:8 ] ) controls the impact parameter dependence and makes the process peripheral e naturally cuts the large @xmath40 contribution .",
    "therefore , based on this argument one uses eqs .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ dsigpp ] ) to write down the single diffractive component of the invariant cross section in hadron - nucleus collisions as @xmath54 with @xmath55 being a function weakly dependent on energy .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ dsdmnuc ] ) over @xmath56 and @xmath34 , one obtains for the single diffractive hadron - nucleus cross section : @xmath57    in next section we will perform the numerical calculation using expressions above in hadron - hadron and proton - nucleus collisions , including the comparison to low energy fixed target measurements .",
    "before presenting the predictions for the single diffractive cross section at @xmath7 collisions at the lhc , we will check the reliability of the current model .",
    "the description of low energy and tevatron data was already tested in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a cross - check",
    ", we consider the alice data @xcite at @xmath58 and 7 tev ( @xmath59 gev / c@xmath60 ) and preliminary data from totem @xcite ( @xmath61 gev / c@xmath60 ) and cms @xcite ( @xmath62 gev / c@xmath60 ) as well .",
    "the model fairly describes data within the error bars and it is consistent with the analysis presented by the alice collaboration @xcite . imposing the same mass - cut as used in lhc experiments we obtain @xmath63 mb , @xmath64 mb and @xmath65 mb at @xmath66 tev .",
    "these results can be compared to the measured values @xmath67 mb ( alice ) , @xmath68 mb ( totem ) and @xmath69 mb ( cms ) , respectively .",
    "now , the second step is to test the reliability in describing the proton - nucleus data . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is shown the prediction for the diffractive dissociation as a function of atomic mass number .",
    "we have compared it to the low energy proton - nucleus data available from helios @xcite ( be , al , w ) and hera - b @xcite ( c , al , ti , w ) experiments .",
    "the curve is obtained using the helios experimental cuts @xmath70 ( gev / c)@xmath60 and @xmath71 .",
    "the model provides a good description for the @xmath10 dependence in proton - nucleus case .",
    "a comparison of the same approach using @xmath72 and @xmath73 beams instead of protons has been done in ref . @xcite and it nicely describes the ehs / na22 data @xcite .",
    "thus , the phenomenological model provides a fairly good description for soft nuclear diffraction . in the referred low - energy experiments only the single diffractive dissociation of the target nucleus ( tsd ) , @xmath5 , is measured .",
    "theoretically , the tsd cross section at high energies is a fraction of the quasi - elastic scattering cross section , where the nucleus is excited . along these lines , in refs .",
    "@xcite the tsd cross section has been computed using glauber - gribov theory including inelastic corrections to all orders of the multiple interaction .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the simple glauber model overestimates the hera - b data in around 30 @xmath74 .",
    "the inclusion of inelastic correction introduces a relative sensibility to the model - dependence and it is able to describe reasonably the data . for sake of comparison , we contrast our results and those from ref .",
    "@xcite for carbon and wolfran .",
    "we obtain @xmath75 mb and 20.7 mb whereas in ref . @xcite it was found @xmath76 mb and @xmath77 mb , respectively .",
    "the measured values by hera - b are @xmath78 mb and @xmath79",
    "mb .     for several nuclear targets from helios @xcite and hera - b @xcite collaborations .",
    "the theoretical curve ( solid line ) is obtained from eq .",

    "[ fig:3 ] we show the differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass @xmath2 for the reaction @xmath80 using the cut @xmath81 ( gev / c)@xmath60 . using the conservative cut",

    "@xcite the inelastic coherent nuclear diffraction is investigated and the role played by color fluctuations in the projectile wave function was demonstrated .",
    "the expression for the diffractive cross section for bsd is non - trivial in general case but an approximated expression which is qualitatively good for all values of @xmath10 is given by @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95/\\langle \\sigma \\rangle^2 $ ] ( with @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 is the nuclear profile function . following ref .",
