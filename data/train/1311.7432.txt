    "the gamma ray burst ( grb ) 970828 is one of the first grbs with an observed x - ray and radio afterglow and a determined redshift of @xmath12=0.9578 from the identification of its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "it was detected by the all sky monitor ( asm ) detector on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) spacecraft @xcite , and then observed also by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the crucial data on the afterglow of grb 970828 were collected by the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) in the ( 2 - 10 ) kev energy range , one day after the rxte detection @xcite , and by rosat @xcite in the ( 0.1 - 2.4 ) kev , one week later .",
    "observations on optical wavelengths failed to detect the optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "the fluence measured by batse implies an isotropic energy for the total emission of @xmath13 erg .",
    "this source is still presenting today , after 15 years from its discovery , an extremely rich problematic in the identification of its astrophysical nature .",
    "the recent joint grb observations made by satellites as swift @xcite , fermi @xcite , agile @xcite , konus - wind @xcite in hard x - rays energy range , as well as the follow - up of their afterglow emission in the ( 0.3 - 10 ) kev range by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xcite on - board swift , and the corresponding follow - up observations in the optical and radio wavelengths have made possible a new understanding of the entire grb process . in this paper we start a procedure of revisiting previous grbs in the batse , pre - swift era , including the new understanding mentioned above . in particular",
    ", we apply to grb 970828 the new bdhn scenario , in which grbs associated with supernovae ( sne ) @xcite , are composed of four different episodes @xcite .    *",
    "the `` episode 1 '' corresponds to the emission from an hyper - critical accretion onto the a neutron star ( ns ) due to the onset of a supernova ( sn ) companion in a close binary system .",
    "the hyper - critical accretion induces allows the ns to reach the critical mass @xcite finally collapsing to a black hole ( bh ) . in the specific case of grb 970828 , this episode",
    "is clearly identified , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.0 ] .",
    "the observed hard x - ray emission is composed of a thermal spectrum plus a power - law component , both evolving in time .",
    "the presence of an evolving thermal component allows the determination of the time decay of the blackbody temperature @xmath14 ( from 80 to 25 kev ) , in the rest - frame time of 20 s , leading to the estimate of the emitter radius between 5000 and 25000 km . *",
    "the `` episode 2 '' , corresponding to the observations of the grb , is related to the collapse of the ns into a bh .",
    "the characteristic parameters of the grb 970828 are the lorentz gamma factor of @xmath15 , the baryon load @xmath3 and a large circumburst density of the order of 10@xmath16 particles/@xmath7 . *",
    "the `` episode 3 '' , in soft x - rays , occurs when the prompt emission from the grb fades away and an additional component , discovered by swift xrt @xcite emerges .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this component , in energetic ( @xmath17 erg ) bdhne , when referred to the rest - frame of the source , follows a standard behavior of the light curve evolution .",
    "this emission encompasses the sn shock break out and the expanding sn ejecta ( @xmath18 ) . in the case of grb 970828 ,",
    "the x - ray emission observed by asca and rosat perfectly overlap with the common trend observed in bdhn systems and exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] . * the `` episode 4 '' is represented by the observations of the optical emission of the sn , which has been observed in some bdhn sources , with @xmath19 , ( grb 090618 , grb 060729 , grb 091127 , grb 111228 , grb 080319b , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally hard to detect a sn at @xmath12=0.9578 and in the case of grb 970828 is even more difficult due to the very large presence of circumburst material , which has also hampered the observations of the optical afterglow , making this source a dark grb .",
    "+    the presence of an evolving thermal component in the first 20 s of the emission of grb 970828 , using batse data , has been indicated by @xcite , where they have considered the emission in the first 20 s of episode 1 .",
    "they then have fitted the evolution of the temperature @xmath14 and the ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the observed flux of the instantaneous blackbody , @xmath22 the stefan constant and @xmath23 the observed temperature , whose evolution in time is fitted with a broken power - law function , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.0 ] . in their theoretical interpretation",
    ", this thermal emission was associated to the photospheric grb emission of a relativistic expanding fireball @xcite , and they inferred a bulk lorentz gamma factor of the expanding plasma , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the ratio between the entire fireball energy and the energy emitted in @xmath26-rays @xcite . since the fireball photospheric radius is given by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the luminosity distance of the grb , they obtain for @xmath29 the value of 2.7 @xmath30 10@xmath31 @xmath32 . in @xcite , the authors have also attributed the remaining grb emission to an unspecified engine activity and neglected all data after 20 s. in their own words , `` we neglect here late - time episodes of engine activity that occur after @xmath33 25 and @xmath33 60 s in this burst '' .",
    "as we will show in the following of this article , we notice the presence of a thermal component in the first 40s , and we attribute it to a non - relativistic initial expansion with radius evolving from @xmath34 to @xmath35 cm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.1 ] .",
    "in addition , we identify the grb emission between t@xmath0 + 50 s and t@xmath0 + 90 s and the third episode between 10@xmath36 - 10@xmath37 s.    in section 2 we give a summary of the observations of grb 970828 and describe our data analysis .",
    "we proceed in section 3 to the description of episode 1 , with the details of the expanding black body emitter , the analysis of the non - thermal component and its interpretation in the bdhn paradigm . in section 4",
    "we describe episode 2 , the authentic grb emission . it is well explained in the context of the fireshell scenario ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a complete review of the model . in section 5",
    "we describe episode 3 , pointing out the clear overlapping of the observed late x - ray data within the theoretical expectation of a bdhn member . in section 6 we discuss about the theoretically expected sn emission , not observed due to the large circumburst medium .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "grb 970828 was discovered with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on 1997 august 28th @xcite . within 3.6 hr",
    "the rxte / pca scanned the region of the sky around the error box of the asm burst and detected a weak x - ray source @xcite .",
    "grb 970828 was also observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and the grb experiment on ulysses @xcite .",
    "the batse - lad light curve is characterized by two main emission phenomena , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.0 ] : the first lasts about 40 s and is well described by two main pulses , the second one is more irregular , being composed by several sharp pulses , lasting other 40 s.    the x - ray afterglow was discovered by the asca satellite 1.17 days after the grb trigger @xcite .",
    "the x - ray afterglow observations continued up to 7 - 10 days from the burst detection .",
    "the optical observations , which started about 4 hr after the burst , did not report any possible optical afterglow for grb 970828 up to @xmath38=23.8 @xcite .",
    "however , the observations at radio wavelengths of the burst position , 3.5 hrs after the initial burst , succeeded in identifying a source at a good significance level of 4.5 @xmath22 @xcite inside the rosat error circle ( 10  ) .",
    "the following deep searches for a possible optical counterpart of this radio source led to the identification of an interacting system of faint galaxies , successively recognized as the host galaxy of grb 970828 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the brightest of this system of galaxies led to the identification of their redshift , being @xmath12=0.9578 .",
    "the lack of an optical transient associated with the afterglow of grb 970828 can be explained as due to the presence of strong absorption , due to dusty clouds in the burst site environment , whose presence does not affect the x - ray and the radio observations of the grb afterglow .",
    "the absence of an optical afterglow @xcite , together with the large intrinsic absorption column detected in the asca x - ray data @xcite and the contemporary detection in radio - wavelengths of the grb afterglow , imply a very large value for the circum - burst medium ( cbm ) ; the variable absorption might be an indication of a strong inhomogeneous cbm distribution .    to analyze in detail this grb ,",
    "we have considered the observations of the batse - lad detector , which observed grb 970828 in the 25 - 1900 kev energy range , and then we have reduced the data by using the rmfit software package . for the spectral analysis we have considered the high energy resolution burst ( herb ) data , which consist of 128 separate high energy resolution spectra stored during the burst emission .",
    "the light curve , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.0 ] , was obtained by using the medium energy resolution ( mer ) data , which consist of 4.096 16-channel spectra summed from triggered detectors .",
    "in analogy to the cases of grb 090618 @xcite , we analyze here the first emission episode in grb 970828 to seek for a thermal signature .",
    "we have rebinned the light curve assuming a signal - to - noise ratio for each time bin of 20 .",
    "this large value of counts per bin allows us to consider a gaussian distribution for the photons in each bin , so in the following we will use a @xmath39 statistic .",
    "as often done in grb analysis , we first perform a time - integrated spectral analysis of the first 40 s of emission , which corresponds to the episode 1 , to identify the best - fit model and the possible presence of thermal features .",
    "we make use of different spectral models , see table [ tab:4b.1 ] , to determine the best - fit function .",
    "we also check if nested models really improve the best - fit , as in the case of models with an extra power - law component .",
    "we find that the best - fit corresponds to a double blackbody model with an extra power - law component .",
    "the check between the band and the double black body plus power law is minimal ( @xmath40 ) but with this last model we note an improvement of the best fit at high energies .",
    "[ tab:4b.1 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with these results , we can estimate the value of the baryon load from the numerical solutions of the fireshell equations of motion .",
    "these solutions for four different values of the total e@xmath41e@xmath42-plasma energy are shown in the fig .",
    "4 of @xcite .",
    "we find that the baryon load is @xmath3 , which corresponds to a lorentz gamma factor at transparency @xmath4 .",
    "the grb emission was simulated with very good approximation by using a density mask characterized by an irregular behavior : all the spikes correspond to spherical clouds with a large particle density @xmath43 part/@xmath7 , and with radius of the order of @xmath44 cm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.3b ] . considering all the clouds found in our analysis ,",
    "the average density of the cbm medium is @xmath45 particles/@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding masses of the blobs are of the order of @xmath46 g , in agreement with the clumps found in grb 090618 .",
    "the most remarkable confirmation of the bdhn paradigm applied to grb 970828 , comes from the late x - ray afterglow emission . as shown in @xcite , from the knowledge of the redshift of the source , we can compute the x - ray luminosity light curve in the common rest frame energy range @xmath47@xmath48 kev after @xmath49 10@xmath36 s from the initial grb emission .",
    "however , while in @xcite the analysis is based on the available x - ray data ( @xmath47@xmath48 kev ) from the _ swift_-xrt detector , grb 970828 occurred in the pre-_swift _ era .",
    "its observational x - ray data are available in the energy range @xmath50@xmath48 kev , since the data were collected by three different satellites : _ rxte _ , _ asca _ and _ rosat_. to further confirm the progenitor mechanism for grb 970828 , we verify the overlapping of the late x - ray data with the ones of the golden sample ( gs ) sources presented in @xcite . to this aim ,",
    "we have computed its luminosity light curve @xmath51 in a common rest - frame energy range @xmath47@xmath48 kev . since the observed energy band is different ( @xmath50@xmath48 kev ) , the expression for the flux light curve @xmath52 in the @xmath47@xmath48 kev rest - frame energy range is not as expressed in eq .  2 of @xcite , but it becomes @xmath53 where @xmath26 is the photon index of the power - law spectral energy distribution of the x - ray data .",
    "all the other data transformations , reported in @xcite , remain unchanged .",
    "we made use in particular of the _",
    "rxte_-pca observations and _ asca _ data presented in @xcite ; the averaged photon indexes are taken from the text , for _ rxte_-pca ( @xmath54 ) , and from tab .  1 , for the _ asca _ data , of the same paper .",
    "the last data - point by _ rosat _ is taken from fig .  7 in @xcite , with a corresponding photon index @xmath55 ; the error on the observed flux is the @xmath56 as indicated for the count rate @xcite .",

    "the analysis of grb 090618 @xcite and grb 101023 @xcite represents an authentic `` rosetta stone '' for the understanding of the grb - sn phenomenon .",
    "the presence of a supernova emission , observed ten days after the burst in the cosmological rest - frame of grb 090618 , was found to have the same luminosity of sn 1998bw @xcite , the sn related to grb 980425 and which is the prototype of sne connected with grbs @xcite . we have transposed the data of the `` bump '' rc - band light curve observed in the optical afterglow of grb 090618 , associated to the presence of an underlying supernova @xcite , to the redshift of grb 970828 .",
    "this simple operation concerns only the transformation of the observed flux , under the assumption that the sn has the same intrinsic luminosity .",
    "moreover , we have also transposed the @xmath58 and @xmath57band light curves of sn 1998bw @xcite , which is the prototype of a supernova associated to a grb . from the @xmath59 correction transformation formula ,",
    "the @xmath60band light curve , transposed at @xmath12=0.9578 , corresponds approximately to the observed @xmath57band light curve , so in principle we should consider the @xmath61 nm transposed light curve as the actual one observed with the @xmath62 nm optical filter .",
    "these transposed light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] .",
    "we conclude that the supernova emission could have been seen between 20 and 40 days after the grb trigger , neglecting any possible intrinsic extinction .",
    "the optical observations were made up to 7 days from the grb trigger , reaching a limit of @xmath63 @xcite , and subsequent deeper images after @xmath64 days @xcite .",
    "so there are no observations in this time interval .",
    "it is appropriate to notice that the @xmath38-band extinction value should be large since the observed column density from the x - ray observations of the grb afterglow is large as well @xcite : the computed light curve for the possible sn of grb 970828 should be lowered by more than 1 magnitude , leading to a sn bump below the @xmath38 = 25.2 limit , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] .",
    "the presence of very dense clouds of matter near the burst site might have darkened both the supernova emission and the grb optical afterglow .",
    "indeed we find the presence of clouds in our simulation at the average distances of @xmath65 cm from the grb progenitor , with average density of @xmath66 part/@xmath7 and typical dimensions of @xmath44 cm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.3b ] .",
    "in conclusion , the recent progress in the observations of x and @xmath26-ray emission , with satellites such as swift , fermi , agile , suzaku , coronas - photon , the possibility of observing grb afterglows with the new generation of optical and radio telescopes , developed since 1997 , and the theoretical understanding of the bdhn paradigm , have allowed to revisit the data of grb 970828 and give a new conceptual understanding of the underlying astrophysical scenario .",
    "we verify in this paper that grb 970828 is a member of the bdhn family .",
    "this new understanding leads to a wealth of information on the different emission episodes which are observed during an igc process . in episode 1",
    ", we determine the evolution of the thermal component and of the radius of the blackbody emitter , given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , see figs .",
    "[ fig:4b.0 ] , [ fig:4b.1 ] .",
    "the onset of the sn is here observed for the first time in an unprecedented circunstance : a sn exploding in a close binary system with a companion ns .",
    "the energetics are correspondingly much larger than the one to be expected in an isolated sn , and presents an high energy component likely associated to an outflow process in the binary accreting system . in episode 2 ,",

    "[ fig:4b.3b ] , of the simulation of the light curve and the spectrum of the real grb emission .",

    ", we have shown that the late afterglow emission observed by asca and rosat , although limited to few data points , when considered in the cosmological rest - frame of the emitter , presents a successful overlap with the standard luminosity behavior of other members of the bdhn family @xcite , which is the most striking confirmation that in grb 970828 an igc process is working .",
    "finally , from this latter analogy with the late x - ray afterglow decay of the `` golden sample '' @xcite , and with the optical bump observed in grb 090618 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] , associated to a sn emission @xcite , we have given reasons why a sn associated to grb 970828 was not observable due to the large interstellar local absorption , in agreement with the large column density observed in the asca x - ray data @xcite and with the large value we have inferred for the cbm density distribution , @xmath73 particles/@xmath7 .    the possibility to observe the energy distribution from a grb in a very wide energy range , thanks to the new dedicated space missions , has allowed to definitely confirm the presence of two separate emission episodes in grbs associated to sne .",
    "future planned missions , as the proposed wide field monitor detector on board the loft mission @xcite , will allow to observe the thermal decay from these objects down to @xmath74 kev .",
    "it is important to note the possibility that the large area detector , designed for the loft mission , will be also able to observe the afterglow emission from times larger than @xmath75 s in the rest - frame , allowing to check possible new bdhne by using the overlapping method described in @xcite and consequently estimate the distance , wherever an observed determination of the redshift is missing .",
