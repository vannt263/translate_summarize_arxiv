    "the collisional construction of galaxies from the merger of lesser galaxies is thought to be a common occurrence in the universe .",
    "coupled with the presence of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the heart of most galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , richstone et al .  1998 ) , dissipationless mergers have been proposed to explain the damaged nuclei in giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , lauer et al .",
    "1995 , faber et al .",
    "1997 , rest et al .",
    "although some galaxy `` core - depletion '' is due to the smbh(s ) dining on stars that venture to close ( e.g. , magorrian & tremaine 1999 ; zhao , haehnelt , & rees , 2002 ; yu 2003 ) , it is primarily from the gravitational slingshot effect that the coalescing smbhs  from the pre - merged galaxies  have on stars while they themselves sink to the bottom of the potential well of the newly we d galaxy ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ; ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura 1991 ; makino & ebisuzaki 1996 ; quinlan 1996 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "theory predicts that the orbital decay of two such smbhs should eject a core mass roughly equal to the combined black hole masses ( ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura 1991 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "current measurements of the central stellar deficit are an order of magnitude larger than the central smbh mass , suggesting that most elliptical galaxies have undergone multiple ( @xmath28 - 10 ) major - mergers ( milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; milosavljevi et al .",
    "2002 ; ravindranath , ho , & filippenko 2002 ) .",
    "this result , however , is at odds with popular models of hierarchial structure formation , which predict an average of only 1 ( dissipationless ) major - merger event for luminous elliptical galaxies ( haehnelt & kauffmann 2002 ; volonteri , madau , & haardt 2003 ) .",
    "recent advances in our understanding of galaxy structure have provided a new framework in which to think about , and measure , central mass deficits .",
    "it is now known that the so - called `` power - law '' galaxies  understood not to have partially depleted cores , nor experienced a ( major ) dissipationless merger event  have an undisturbed srsic @xmath3 profile over their _",
    "entire _ radial extent .",
    "that is , their inner light - profiles show no deviation relative to their outer @xmath3 profile ( trujillo et al .",
    "on the other hand , the more luminous ( @xmath4 mag ) `` core '' galaxies display a clear flattening of their inner light - profile relative to the inward extrapolation of their outer srsic profile ( graham et al .   2003b , 2004 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ; trujillo et al .",
    "the ` break ' in the profiles where this transition occurs marking the boundary of their relatively unpopulated cores .    with this new knowledge of what galaxy profiles look like",
    ", this paper considers the form of the core - less galaxy light - profiles when representing the _ original _ stellar distribution of the disturbed profiles , in order to compute the central stellar deficit and hence the level of damage to a galaxy s core .",
    "we proceed by quantifying the central stellar deficit as the flux deficit relative to the inward extrapolation of the smoothly curving , stellar distribution outside of any possible , partially depleted core .",
    "this approach , therefore , does not assign _ any _ mass deficit to `` power - law '' galaxies , whose inner light - profiles display no clear downward deviation from their outer srsic light - profiles .",
    "such a qualitative description can be placed on a quantitative footing through employment of the `` core - srsic '' light - profile model ( graham et al .",
    "2003b ) , applied in figure 1 to the `` core '' galaxy ngc  3348 .",
    "this model consists of an inner power - law and an outer srsic function . in practice ( trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) , the transition at the `` break radius '' is sharp , providing a 5-parameter function capable of describing the entire radial extent of galaxies with cores .",
    "the central flux deficit is obtained by differencing the luminosity @xmath5 within @xmath6 of a ) the inwardly - extrapolated outer srsic profile @xmath7 and b ) a power - law light - profile with slope @xmath8 matching the observed inner profile slope , and intercepting the srsic model at @xmath6 , @xmath9 the term @xmath10 is the intensity of the srsic profile at the effective radius @xmath11 enclosing half the galaxy light .",
    "the exponent ` @xmath12 ' describes the curvature of the light - profile , and @xmath13 is simply a function of @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the complete and incomplete gamma functions respectively .",
    "the intensity at @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure has been applied here to the 7 bona fide core galaxies from trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and the @xmath11 values are for each galaxy s outer @xmath3 profile as if it had no partially depleted core . ] .",
    "the resultant flux deficits are 0.070.7% of the total galaxy flux . allowing for the fact that these galaxies are at a range of distances from us , the _ apparent _ magnitude differences @xmath20 $ ] were converted into _ absolute _ magnitudes ( @xmath21 ) using the galaxy distance estimates from tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and then converted into units of solar flux using an absolute @xmath22-band magnitude for our sun of @xmath23=4.46 mag ( cox 2000 ) .",
    "finally , these values were transformed into solar masses assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 3.0 ( worthey 1994 ) . such a ratio is representative of an evolved ( i.e. , faded ) 12 billion year old , single stellar population observed through an @xmath22-band optical filter .",
    "the mass deficits @xmath24 are given in table 1 .",
    "models of hierarchical structure formation predict that galaxies will collide ; indeed , this phenomenon has been observed for many years .",
    "theoretical expectations for the ejected core mass , after the violent unification of galaxies containing smbhs , scale as 0.5 - 2@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the _ final _ bh mass and @xmath27 is the number of merger events ( milosavljevi et al .",
    "the variable term at the front is because equal - mass mergers scour out more stars than a collision involving a lesser - mass , secondary galaxy .",
    "thus , by knowing a galaxy s central stellar deficit ( table 1 ) , and its black hole mass @xmath26 , one can place constraints on the extent of this merger process .",
    "we have estimated the smbh mass of each galaxy using two techniques .",
    "first , we employed the @xmath26@xmath28 relation of gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , in which @xmath26 is derived from the galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath28 . using the steeper @xmath29@xmath28 relation of ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 )",
    "had little difference because of the different zero - points in these two relations .",
    "the second smbh mass estimate came from the independent @xmath26@xmath14 relation ( graham et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a ) .",
    "this relation is as strong as the @xmath29@xmath28 relation and has the same small degree of scatter , but has the advantage that it is a purely photometric technique , requiring only ( uncalibrated ) images rather than ( telescope - time expensive ) galaxy spectra .",
    "figure 2 shows each galaxy s depleted core mass plotted against both estimates of the smbh mass .",
    "the ratio of the stellar mass deficit to central black hole mass has a mean @xmath30 average deviation of @xmath31 ( panel a , @xmath26@xmath14 ) and @xmath32 ( panel b , @xmath26@xmath28 ) , consistent with these galaxies having experienced one major ( i.e. , equal - mass ) dry merger event .",
    "support for the above mass deficits comes from the agreement with the merger simulations of makino & ebisuzaki ( 1996 ) , the ( cusp regeneration ) hierarchial merger models of volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and the theoretical expectations of haehnelt & kauffmann ( 2002 ) .",
    "although the latter authors predicted a median number of equal mass mergers for faint ( power - law ) and bright ( core ) elliptical galaxies of 1 and 3 respectively , the number of major mergers since the last collision that involved substantial gas accretion ( @xmath33 ) is 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "the presence of gas is important because it dilutes the wrecking ball action of the smbhs on the stars because it , rather than the stars , fosters the coalesence of the black holes and it can lead to the creation of new stars ( see , e.g. , zhao et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , our conclusions that power - law galaxies do not have partially depleted cores from galaxy collisions , and that the number of ( dissipationless ) major mergers producing luminous galaxies , with @xmath34 mag , is equal to about 1 , are supported by current cold dark matter models of hierarchial structure formation .    given @xmath35 , one may wonder if some depleted cores might have formed from the runaway merging of stars ( e.g. , begelman & rees 1978 ; quinlan & shapiro 1989 ) within what may once have been the dense cores of massive ellipticals ( graham & guzmn 2003 ) , rather than from the scattering of stars from coalescing black holes .",
    "the first objection to such a process would be those cases in which @xmath24 is actually greater than @xmath26 . such a mechanism would also require a certain level of refinement , such as re - populating the loss - cone , in order to explain the absence of ( resolved ) cores in less luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "the expected break radii  derived from a centrally depleted srsic model  are not observed amongst the `` power - law '' galaxies .",
    "for example , if the 12 `` power - law '' galaxies in trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) had cores with inner power - law slopes ranging from 0.00.3 , then , assuming @xmath36 , they should have break radii of 0.170.5 arcseconds , which they do not .",
    "it is pertinent to inquire why previous estimates of the central mass deficit are larger than the values obtained here .",
    "one reason is that it had been assumed that every galaxy once had a steep isothermal @xmath37 core before any merging black holes wreaked their havoc .",
    "there is , however , no observational evidence that any such universal density - profile @xmath38 exists , or once existed amongst the `` power - law '' galaxies .",
    "in actuality , a luminosity - dependent range of inner profiles shapes is now known to exist ( gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ; balcells , graham , & peletier 2004 ) . no single power - law slope can be used to approximate the initial , undisturbed , stellar distribution of all elliptical galaxies .",
    "milosavljevi et al .  (",
    "2002 ) , for example , had defined the onset of partially depleted cores as the radius where the negative , logarithmic gradient of the deprojected light - profiles ( i.e. , the spatial , luminosity - density profiles ) equaled 2 .",
    "that is , where the observed slope matched that of the isothermal model .",
    "they then derived central , stellar mass deficits from the difference between the observed density - profile and the inward extrapolation of the isothermal model from this point .",
    "this approach to estimating the depleted core mass is illustrated in figure 3 , where we show both the observed light - profile and the ( deprojected ) density - profile of the core - less , `` power - law '' galaxy ngc 5831 .",
    "such a prescription encounters a number of difficulties .",
    "an extraordinary level of fine - tuning would be required to deplete stars over the full radial extent of the initial isothermal core , assuming one existed , but not beyond the final core radius , which one assumes still has its original slope of -2 today . moreover , with such an approach , many of the `` power - law '' galaxies which are not ( traditionally ) recognized as having a partially depleted core will be assigned one .",
    "such theoretical core radii ( and mass deficits ) are not only questionable , but excessively large  sometimes greater than 1 kpc  and do nt match the observed break radii in core galaxies , which are invariably less than a few hundred parsecs ( see table 1 ) . a second approach to estimating the central deficit had been to use break radii derived from the nuker model ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) , and to assume an isothermal core once existed inside of this radius .",
    "with such an approach the estimated central deficits are again too high because of a ) the excessively steep isothermal model that is assumed , and b ) because , as described in graham et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and shown in trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , nuker - derived break radii typically overestimate the actual break radii by factors of 2 to 5 .    the mass deficits obtained with the above two methods are 330 times larger than our values , and are shown in figure 2 for comparison .",
    "our new measurements of the mass deficit are significantly ( 99.4% , from both a k - s test and students t - test ) different to those values obtained using the isothermal assumption , and reveal that the galactic merger history of the universe , at least for massive elliptical galaxies , is roughly an order of magnitude less violent than previous observational analyses ( milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; milosavljevi et al .  2002 ; ravindranath , ho , & filippenko 2002 ) had suggested .",
    "we plan on analyzing more galaxies , and measuring the ellipticity of their evacuated core region .",
    "this may shed light on the orientation of the initial orbits of the black holes , and allow one to explore any possible correlation with the host galaxy ellipticity",
    ". a greater range of data will also allow one to explore whether there is any trend between @xmath39 and galaxy magnitude .",
    "such a correlation may be expected if bigger `` core '' galaxies have experienced more dissipationless merger events than less luminous `` core '' galaxies .",
