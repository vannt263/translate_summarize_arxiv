    "aqueous solutions containing polymers and small associating molecules such as folded proteins and amphiphiles ( surfactants ) are commonly found in biological systems and industrial applications . as a result",
    ", extensive efforts have been devoted in the past few decades to the study of polymer  surfactant interactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , there has been growing interest in the interactions between dna macromolecules and surfactants , lipids and short polyamines @xcite .",
    "these interactions are relevant to various biochemical applications such as dna extraction and purification @xcite and genetic delivery systems @xcite .",
    "association of folded proteins ( _ e.g. , _ reca ) with dna plays a key role in genetic regulatory mechanisms .",
    "structural details of this association have been studied in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , we have presented a general theory for the self - assembly in aqueous solutions of polymers and smaller associating molecules @xcite .",
    "two different scenarios emerge , depending on the flexibility of the polymer .",
    "if the polymer is flexible enough , it actively participates in the self - assembly , resulting in mixed aggregates jointly formed by the two species .",
    "the polymer conformation changes considerably upon self - assembly but remains extended on a global scale , as the chain undergoes only _ partial collapse _",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the polymer is stiff , partial collapse is inhibited .",
    "the criterion determining the ` flexible ' _ vs. _ ` stiff ' scenarios concerns the polymer statistics on a mesoscopic length scale characterizing correlations in the solution ( usually a few nanometers ) .",
    "it was found @xcite that the flexible ( stiff ) scenario holds if the exponent @xmath0 , relating the number of monomers @xmath1 to the spatial size @xmath2 they occupy , @xmath3 , is smaller ( larger ) than @xmath4 on that length scale ( @xmath5 being the dimensionality ) .",
    "this distinction is analogous to the one made in the critical behavior of certain disordered systems @xcite  if the critical exponent @xmath0 of a system satisfies @xmath6 , the critical behavior would be smeared by impurities ( in analogy to the partial collapse ) , whereas if @xmath7 , the critical point remains intact . indeed ,",
    "neutral flexible polymers in three dimensions , having @xmath8 , are found by scattering experiments to associate with surfactants in the form of a ` chain of wrapped aggregates ' @xcite . on the other hand , stiff dna molecules , having @xmath9 on the relevant length scale ,",
    "are found to either remain unperturbed by surfactant binding @xcite , or undergo a discontinuous coil - to - globule transition @xcite , provided the chain is much longer than the persistence length .    in previous publications @xcite we concentrated on the flexible case and the corresponding partial collapse , where the polymer degrees of freedom play an important role . in the opposite extreme limit of stiff , rod - like molecules ,",
    "the conformational degrees of freedom of the polymer can be neglected and the chain may be regarded as a linear ` binding substrate ' .",
    "models for stiff polymers , inspired by the zimm - bragg theory @xcite , treat the bound molecules as a one - dimensional lattice - gas ( or ising ) system with nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "they have been widely used to fit experimental binding isotherms for polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged surfactants @xcite .",
    "recently , more detailed electrostatic models have been proposed for the interaction between rod - like polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged surfactants @xcite .",
    "in addition , a theoretical work focusing on the _ specific _ binding of proteins to dna has been recently presented @xcite , treating a pair of bound proteins as geometrically constraining inclusions on the dna chain .    in the current work",
    "we address the intermediate case of _ semiflexible _ polymers .",
    "the polymer we consider is stiff in the sense defined above , _",
    "i.e. , _ its persistence length , @xmath10 , exceeds several nanometers and , hence , the polymer is characterized by @xmath11 on that length scale . the total chain length , however , is considered to be much larger than @xmath10 , and the entire polymer can not be regarded , therefore , as a single rigid rod .",
    "this case corresponds , in particular , to experiments on long dna molecules @xcite , whose persistence length is typically very large ( of order 50 nm ) , but much smaller than the total chain length ( which is usually larger than a micron ) @xcite .",
    "we argue that such an intermediate system may , in certain cases , be governed by different physics .",
    "although the polymer is too stiff to change conformation and actively participate in the self - assembly , its degrees of freedom induce attractive correlations between bound molecules .",
    "those fluctuation - induced correlations are weak but have a long spatial range ( of order @xmath10 ) and , hence , may strongly affect the binding thermodynamics .",
    "the model is presented in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "bound molecules are assumed to modify the local features of polymer conformation , _",
    "e.g. , _ change its local stiffness . in the limit of weak coupling",
    ", our model reduces to the kac - baker model @xcite , which is solvable exactly .",
    "this limit is discussed in sec .",
    "although turning out to be of limited interest in practice , the weak - coupling limit provides insight into the mechanism of association , and helps us justify further approximations .",
    "section [ strong ] presents a mean - field calculation for an arbitrary strength of coupling .",
    "this analysis leads to our main conclusions , and in sec .",
    "[ sec_tension ] it is extended to polymers under external tension . the results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , where we also discuss several relevant experiments involving dna and point at future directions .",
    "small molecules bound to stiff polymers are commonly modeled as a one - dimensional lattice gas ( or ising system ) @xcite .",
    "each monomer serves as a binding site , which can either accommodate a small molecule or be empty , and the surrounding dilute solution is considered merely as a bulk reservoir of small molecules . in the current work",
    "we stay at the level of a one - dimensional model , assuming that the polymer is still quite ( yet not infinitely ) stiff , _ i.e. , _ the persistence length is much larger than the monomer size .",
    "in addition , a dilute polymer limit is assumed , where inter - chain effects can be neglected .",
    "we focus on the effect of introducing the polymer degrees of freedom and , hence , seek a simple meaningful coupling between the polymer and the bound ` lattice gas ' .",
    "a polymer configuration is defined by a set of vectors , @xmath12 , specifying the lengths and orientations of the @xmath1 monomers . in addition",
    ", each monomer serves as a binding site which can be either empty ( @xmath13 ) or occupied by a small molecule ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a configuration of the entire system is defined , therefore , by specifying @xmath15 .",
    "since the polymer is assumed to be locally stiff , a natural choice would be to couple @xmath16 with the square of the local chain curvature , @xmath17 , thus modifying the local chain stiffness .",
    "however , in the usual kratky - porod worm - like - chain model of semiflexible polymers @xcite , chain segments are taken as rigid rods of fixed length ( @xmath18 ) , and each squared - curvature term contains only one degree of freedom ( _ e.g. , _ the angle @xmath19 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "consequently , this coupling , @xmath22 , would leave @xmath23 uncorrelated , leading merely to a trivial shift in the chemical potential of bound molecules @xcite .",
    "one option to proceed is to consider higher - order extensions of the worm - like - chain hamiltonian , involving three consecutive monomers",
    ". this will introduce correlations between bound molecules at different sites .",
    "we take , however , a simpler route and modify the worm - like - chain model by allowing the monomer length to fluctuate .",
    "this modification was originally presented by harris and hearst @xcite , using a single global constraint for the average chain length .",
    "the modified model was shown to successfully reproduce the results of the kratky - porod model as far as thermodynamic averages ( _ e.g. , _ correlation functions , radius of gyration ) were concerned .",
    "it was less successful , however , in recovering more detailed statistics of the worm - like chain ( _ e.g. , _ distribution function , form factor ) , particularly in the limit of large stiffness .",
    "the harris - hearst model was later refined by lagowski _",
    "_ @xcite and ha and thirumalai @xcite , replacing the single global constraint by a set of local constraints for the average segment lengths .",
    "this further modification was shown to be equivalent to a stationary - phase approximation for the chain partition function , yielding reliable results for average quantities , as well as more detailed statistics @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar approach was used in a recent model of semiflexible polymer collapse @xcite .",
    "it should be borne in mind that , despite its success in the past , the constraint relaxation remains essentially an uncontrolled approximation . in the current work",
    "we restrict ourselves to thermodynamic averages , such as monomer - monomer correlations and free energies , for which the modified model with a single global contraint can be trusted .",
    "thus , the rigid constraints of the original kratky - porod model , @xmath24 , are relaxed into thermodynamic - average ones , @xmath25 , where the mean - square monomer size is taken hereafter as the unit length . using the modified model for the chain ,",
    "each @xmath17 term involves two consecutive monomers ( and not merely the angle between them ) , leading to a meaningful coupling between binding and polymer conformation .",
    "the partition function of the combined system of polymer and bound molecules is written , therefore , as @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) @xmath10 is the persistence length of the bare chain , characterizing its intrinsic stiffness .",
    "it is assumed to be much larger than the monomer size , @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling is introduced through the stiffness term , assuming that a bound molecule modifies the local stiffness by a fraction @xmath28 , which may be either negative or positive but can not change the positive sign of the overall stiffness term @xcite .",
    "the second term contains a set of multipliers , @xmath29 , to be chosen so that the constraints @xmath25 are satisfied .",
    "however , replacement of the entire set @xmath30 by a single multiplier @xmath31 can be shown to yield a non - extensive correction @xcite , which becomes negligible in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we use hereafter a single multiplier , @xmath31 .",
    "finally , the system is assumed to be in contact with a reservoir of solute molecules . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) accounts for this contact along with any other factors which couple linearly to the degree of binding .",
    "typically , @xmath33 contains the chemical potential of the solute reservoir and the direct energy of solute molecule ",
    "monomer binding .",
    "( all energies in this work are expressed in units of the thermal energy , @xmath34 . )",
    "note that we have not included in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) any direct short - range ( _ e.g. , _ nearest - neighbor ) interactions between bound molecules .",
    "thus , all interactions in the model arise from the coupling to the polymer degrees of freedom . short - range interactions between bound molecules do exist in physical systems . yet , in the limit of @xmath27 and @xmath35 , which is of interest to the current work , such direct interactions have a minor effect on binding , as is demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "hence , we omit them for the sake of brevity .    as a reference ,",
    "let us start with the previously studied partition function of the bare polymer @xcite , @xmath36 .",

    "the corresponding free energy per monomer ( in the ensemble of _ constrained _ @xmath20 ) is @xmath41 various correlations in the bare chain can be calculated .",
    "the pair correlation between segment vectors along the chain sequence is @xmath42 which explains why the parameter @xmath10 has been defined as the persistence length .",

    "in this limit the model becomes analogous to the exactly solvable kac - baker model @xcite , and we show that identical results are derived from a simple mean - field calculation .",
    "we then use this observation to justify a mean - field calculation for an arbitrary value of @xmath46 .    a cumulant expansion of eq .",

    ", the partition function is decoupled into a polymer contribution and an effective contribution from the bound solute molecules , @xmath50 where @xmath51    the introduction of the polymer degrees of freedom and their coupling to the binding ones have led to two effects , as compared to previous lattice - gas theories .",
    "first , there is a shift in the chemical potential , @xmath52 .",
    "this is equivalent to an effective change in the affinity between the small molecules and the chain . as expected , if binding strengthens the local stiffness of the chain ( @xmath53 ) , the affinity is reduced ( _ i.e. , _ the isotherm is shifted to higher chemical potentials ) , whereas if it weakens the stiffness ( @xmath54 ) , the shift is to lower @xmath33 .",
    "the second , more interesting effect is that bound molecules experience an attractive potential , @xmath55 , along the chain .",
    "the amplitude of this effective interaction is small ( @xmath56 ) , but its range is large  of order @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath10 is increased there are two opposing consequences  the interaction amplitude diminishes , while the interaction range is extended . the overall effect on the thermodynamics of binding , therefore , has to be checked in detail .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the bound solute , @xmath57 , is a lattice - gas version of the kac - baker model @xcite , which is exactly solvable .",
    "moreover , the procedure relevant to our semiflexible polymer , _",
    "i.e. , _ increasing @xmath10 while keeping @xmath58 , is precisely the one studied in detail by kac and baker . their results , as applied to our binding problem , can be summarized as follows . for any finite @xmath10 ,",
    "the bound molecules are always in a disordered state along the polymer chain , as in any one - dimensional system with finite - range interactions .",

    "thus , the sharp binding isotherms obtained from the kac - baker model for @xmath65 do not apply , strictly speaking , for our polymer binding problem .",
    "the weak - coupling calculation does demonstrate , however , how fluctuations in polymer conformation induce long - range attraction between bound molecules .",

    "several regimes are found as function of tension .",
    "for very weak tension , @xmath143 , the leading - order term which couples binding and tension is found from eqs .",

    "i.e. , _ it is only linear in @xmath79 .",
    "hence , to leading order in @xmath145 there is no effect on the critical point .",
    "although the tension influences chain fluctuations ( _ e.g. , _ causing the chain to extend linearly with @xmath132 ) , it is too weak to affect the fluctuation - induced interactions between bound molecules .",
    "the next - order term scales like @xmath146 , leading to a very small shift of @xmath147 in the critical point ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_ec_tension ] ) .    for @xmath148 , the leading - order term in the free energy , according to eqs .",
    "( [ fpt_strong ] ) and ( [ f_mf_tension ] ) , is @xmath149 . here",
    "two regimes should be distinguished . for intermediate tension , @xmath150 ,",
    "the critical line scales like @xmath151 , reflecting a more significant , yet still weak effect of tension .",
    "although the chain conformation is significantly stretched by tension in this regime , the induced interaction between bound molecules is not strongly affected .",
    "however , for @xmath152 , the tension term in the free energy [ @xmath149 ] becomes dominant , leading to a linear dependence of the critical point on tension , @xmath154 .",
    "the above analysis for the dependence of the critical coupling on tension is summarized in the following expression : @xmath155 the various regimes are also clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_ec_tension ] .",
    "note that for the large values of @xmath10 considered in this theory the intermediate tension region , @xmath150 , is very wide .",
    "we have considered binding of small molecules to isolated semiflexible polymer chains , where the persistence length @xmath10 is much larger than the monomer size but still smaller than the total chain length @xmath1 .",
    "we have demonstrated that in such systems polymer fluctuations induce attraction between bound molecules .",
    "the long range of this interaction ( of the same order as the persistence length ) can lead to strong effects on the binding process .",
    "in particular , if bound molecules significantly affect local features of the chain , _ e.g. , _ weaken or strengthen the stiffness by a factor of about 5 ( @xmath156 or @xmath157 ) , then the binding is predicted to be extremely cooperative , occurring as a transition for a sharply defined solute concentration .",
    "this is an unusual , yet practical example for a one - dimensional system exhibiting a sharp transition due to long - range interactions .",
    "the results of the model should apply , in particular , to the association of dna with smaller molecules such as surfactants and compact proteins .    subjecting the polymer to external tension",
    "has been studied as well . by suppressing the fluctuation - induced interaction",
    ", the applied tension may strongly affect the binding .",
    "the effect is significant for sufficiently strong tension of order @xmath158 .",
    "[ for dna this implies @xmath159 pn . ] in cases where binding weakens the chain stiffness , such a high tension should make the sharp binding transition disappear altogether ( _ i.e. , _ regardless of the strength of coupling or temperature ) . in cases where binding strengthens the chain stiffness ,",
    "a tension of @xmath160 significantly shifts @xmath161 to higher values .",
    "it is worth mentioning that tension - induced pairwise interaction between _ specifically _ bound proteins on a dna chain was studied in a previous work @xcite .",
    "the interaction of dna with oppositely charged cationic surfactants has been thoroughly studied by potentiometric techniques @xcite and fluorescence microscopy @xcite .",
    "isotherms measured by potentiometry reveal a very cooperative , albeit continuous binding .",
    "fluorescence microscopy convincingly demonstrated , however , that the binding to a _",
    "dna molecule has a discrete nature resembling a 1st - order phase transition .",
    "it is usually accompanied by a coil - to - globule collapse of the dna chain ( which lies outside the scope of the current theory ) .",
    "the smoothness of potentiometric isotherms was shown to arise from averaging over an _",
    "ensemble _ of dna molecules , coexisting in bound and unbound states @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained for the association of dna with spermidine @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of the observed cooperativity ( or even discontinuous transition ) has not been clarified .",
    "it is usually fitted to a phenomenological parameter describing strong interaction between nearest - neighboring bound molecules @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that oppositely charged surfactants bound to dna chains significantly modify the chain stiffness ( probably weakening it ) .",
    "thus , our model demonstrates that the strong cooperativity observed in experiments can be well accounted for by weak , yet long - range interactions induced by polymer fluctuations .",
    "recently , the kinetics of non - specific binding of reca proteins to dna has been studied by single - molecule manipulation @xcite .",
    "reca is a bacterial protein involved in dna recombination and known to cause significant changes in the local structure of the double strand upon binding @xcite .",
    "it was found to increase the dna stiffness by a large factor , estimated around 10 in one study @xcite and above 4 in another @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a large , positive @xmath46 in our model .",
    "a very cooperative nucleation - and - growth kinetics was observed , as expected from the current model . moreover , in certain situations it was possible to achieve a smaller increase of stiffness by binding of reca .",
    "this led , correspondingly , to a less cooperative process @xcite . yet",
    "probably the most compelling evidence is that the binding cooperativity was shown to be sensitive to external tension of order 10100 pn .",
    "it was consequently deduced that dna conformational fluctuations play a key role in reca binding @xcite , in accord with the model .",
    "the current work is restricted to one - dimensional interactions along the chain sequence , assuming that the polymer is locally stiff and obeys the worm - like - chain description .",
    "apart from changing local properties of the polymer , an important feature not treated by the model is that bound molecules may also modify _ volume _ interactions between the monomers , thus affecting the three - dimensional conformation of the polymer .",
    "for example , binding of oppositely charged surfactants to a dna molecule locally neutralizes the dna charge .",
    "this should lead , indeed , to a modified stiffness , but also to a reduced 2nd virial coefficient , which may drive a coil - to - globule collapse @xcite .",
    "the collapse can be also driven by fluctuations in the concentration of ions adjacent to the chain , as has been demonstrated by recent theoretical studies @xcite .    in order to check the theory presented in this work more",
    "experiments are required , focusing , in particular , on the effect of persistence length and tension on binding .",
    "the fluorescence microscopy techniques , which have been successfully used for dna  surfactant association , may be applied to chains under tension or flow , thus examining the role of fluctuations .",
    "it would be interesting to study a system consisting of a semiflexible polymer and bound molecules in computer simulations , and thereby check the applicability of our mean - field approximation .",
    "an important extension of the model , as mentioned above , would be to introduce volume interactions and obtain binding - induced collapse as observed in experiments .",
