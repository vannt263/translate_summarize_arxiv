    "doubtless , one of the most interesting open questions in physics by now is the one concerning the nature of the dark matter in the universe . in a series of recent works",
    "we have proposed that the dark matter in cosmos is of scalar field nature @xcite . following an analogous procedure as in particle physics",
    ", we wrote a lagrangian with all the terms needed to reproduce the observed universe .",
    "in particular , using the scalar field potential for the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm )    @xmath0 \\label{cosh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 , we were able to reproduce all the successes of the standard lambda cold dark matter model ( @xmath2cdm ) at cosmological level very well including galactic scales @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the scalar potential @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be fitted by cosmological observations obtaining @xmath5 and @xmath6 , being @xmath7 the planck mass@xcite .",
    "the mass of the scalar particle is then @xmath8ev ( compare this value of the scalar mass with that in @xcite ) .",
    "under galactic scales there are some differences between the @xmath9cdm  and the sfdm .",
    "the self interaction of the scalar field @xmath10 could explain the observed dearth of dwarf galaxies and the smoothness of the galaxy core halos as well @xcite .",
    "the question whether this scalar field is from fundamental origin or it is a combination of some other fundamental particles , is open .",
    "nevertheless , in order to reproduce the high resolution n - body numerical simulations of self interacting dark matter@xcite , we found that the renormalization scale of this scalar field is of the same order of the planck mass @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that this scalar field dark matter could have a fundamental origin .",
    "we have also studied the scalar field hypothesis at galactic level in @xcite .",
    "the idea follows the standard idea of galaxy formation , namely that scalar field ( dark matter ) fluctuations are the responsible for the origin of the galaxies . in the case of the scalar field potential ( 1 )",
    ", we have @xmath11 for regions where the scalar field fluctuation dominates @xmath12 . of course , as in the standard theory of galaxy formation , the dark matter fluctuations are of different size in different regions of the universe , for different galaxies .",
    "therefore , at galactic level , we have a scalar field potential which depends on local variables .",
    "thus , the exponential potential approximates the @xmath13 potential in some regimes of the scalar field and we could develop some interesting aspects of a scalar dark matter halo in galaxies .    on the other hand , new observations show that supermassive central objects lying in active galactic nuclei seem to be correlated with the velocity dispersion of the dark matter composing the dark halo , suggesting that the central object was formed at the same time than the halo@xcite .",
    "this is probably contrary to the standard idea about galactic nuclei that proposes the existence of a central black hole , since it should be formed a time after the disc , @xmath14 much more after the formation of the halo .",
    "going further , it has been also shown that the supermassive objects which are supposed to be in the center of galactic nuclei , could be boson stars , obtaining the same predictions for the rate of accretion of matter due to the presence of a completely regular space - time background without surface or horizon@xcite .",
    "the question we are facing now is whether there is a dynamical mechanism that could provide a realistic scenario of galaxy formation using the scalar field dark matter hypothesis .",
    "first of all , a complete evolution of galactic and under galactic fluctuations belong to the non - linear regime of perturbations .",
    "the right answer would be provided by numerical evolution of einstein s equations .",
    "fortunately , a partial answer is given in numerical research on einstein s equations developed since 1990 .",
    "in particular , the collapse of a scalar field has been studied deeply in @xcite , and it was found that there are final equilibrium and stable configurations for collapsed scalar field particles : boson stars ( when the scalar field is complex ) and oscillatons ( when the scalar field is real and time - dependent ) , both of them being formed through a process called gravitational cooling@xcite . based on these ideas , we present in section [ sec : toymodel ] the motivations inviting us to build a galactic model with scalar fields , followed by the solution to the model in section [ sec : solution ] ; physical features of the model are shown in section [ sec : physics ] and finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "we first recall the main results obtained in@xcite . through the gravitational cooling process",
    ", a cosmological fluctuation of scalar field would collapse to form a compact oscillaton by ejecting part of the scalar field .",
    "this ejected part of the cooling process would carry the excess of kinetic energy out and can play the role of the halo of the collapsed object .",
    "the final configuration then consists of a central compact object , an oscillaton , surrounded by a diffuse cloud of scalar field , both formed at the same time due to the same collapse process .",
    "this would provide a correlation between the central object and the scalar halo .    if the central object is an oscillaton , its formation is due to coherent scalar oscillations around the minimum of the scalar potential  ( [ cosh ] ) .",
    "the scalar field @xmath10 and the metric coefficients ( considering the spherically symmetric case ) are time dependent and it was proved that this configuration is stable , non - singular and asymptotically flat@xcite .",
    "but , this could not be the final answer because , from the quantum - mechanical point of view , a bose - einstein condensate should form and we must take into account that the scalar field @xmath10 can also decay or self annihilate@xcite . in such a case , we should have to consider the scattering cross section @xmath15 in order to calculate the relaxation time of such condensation . in the models treated in@xcite",
    ", the coefficient of @xmath16 is the responsible both for the size of the compact object and for the scattering cross section @xmath17 with potential  ( [ cosh ] ) it is necessary to take into account all the couplings@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to find the relaxation time smaller than the age of the universe if @xcite    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the effective @xmath16-theory coupling .",
    "then , considering the value @xmath20 ev ( see @xcite ) , @xmath21 .",
    "this condition is well satisfied for our case since @xmath22@xcite .",
    "this ensures that the relaxation time is shorter than the age of the universe . in the case",
    "studied in@xcite , a massive scalar field without self - interaction collapses ejecting out 13% of the initial configuration of scalar field .",
    "the critical mass of the final configuration for the oscillaton depends on the mass of the boson@xcite . for our model ( 1 ) , the mass of the scalar field is @xmath23 and it is found that    @xmath24    which is a surprising result : the critical mass needed for the scalar field to collapse is of the same order of magnitude than the dark matter contents of a standard galaxy .",
    "then , we expect that the fluctuations of this scalar field due to jeans instabilities will in general collapse to form objects with mass of the same order than the mass of the halo of a typical galaxy .",
    "this is the reason by means of which we expect that the sfdm model can also work at galactic level .",
    "summarizing , we consider two working hypothesis up to now .",
    "first , we identify the formation of a central compact object and a halo with the gravitational collapse of a scalar field .",
    "the compact object could be an oscillaton ( since we are dealing only with a real scalar field ) or a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "second , we identify the ejected scalar field with the halo of this galaxy .    in a realistic model the metric and fields should depend on time and a complete study would involve numerical calculations within and beyond general relativity .",
    "one alternative is to study the behavior of the galaxy numerically with all the hypotheses stated above .",
    "this procedure has the advantage that we do not need to eliminate any _ a priori _ consideration , but we can loose some important physical information inside of the numbers we obtain .",
    "other alternative is to perform some approximations on the metric and fields and find exact solutions .",
    "these approximations could also lead us to loose crucial information of the system but we can keep physics under control . in our opinion , both procedures must be developed in order to have a better understanding of the hypothesis .    in this work",
    "we will adopt the second alternative , i.e. we will build a toy model for case stated above in purely geometrical terms and considering only the final stage of the collapse .",
    "we let for a future work the dynamical evolution@xcite . to start with",
    ", we support our toy model on the numerical results studied in @xcite . first ,",
    "since the time - dependence of the metric in an oscillaton is quite small @xcite , we suppose then that the center of this toy galaxy is an oscillaton which oscillates coherently but considering a _ static _ metric .",
    "this is an approximation because neither the galactic nuclei nor the oscillaton are expected to be static .",
    "however , for the purposes of this analytic work , we suppose that the dynamics of the oscillaton can be frozen in time in a way we explain below .",
    "second , we do not expect the scalar halo to possess the same properties than the collapsed oscillaton ; in some sense , they must be different .",
    "thus , we will consider the scalar halo as another scalar field .",
    "third , baryonic matter is considered to lie in the galaxy .",
    "we suppose that only the baryonic matter at the galaxy center and the bulge will contribute essentially to the curvature of the space - time of the galaxy . this baryonic component is assumed to be dust . as in previous works @xcite ,",
    "we let the luminous matter around the galaxy as test particles , i.e. they do not essentially contribute to the curvature of the space - time .",
    "the lagrangian density we have to start with reads @xmath25 , being @xmath26 the scalar curvature and the former terms correspond to the lagrangian of the scalar field oscillaton ( sfo ) , the scalar field halo ( sfh ) and dust , which should play the role of a galactic bulge . for the scalar objects ,",
    "the following expressions are available    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the scalar field corresponding to the oscillaton and @xmath29 its potential of self - interaction .",
    "@xmath30 is the scalar field describing the scalar field halo and @xmath31 its respective scalar potential . as a consequence of the non - coupling of the fields in the total lagrangian ,",
    "the einstein s equations are written @xmath32 $ ] , with    @xmath33   \\nonumber \\\\ t_{\\mu \\nu } ^{sfh } & = & \\partial _ { \\mu } \\psi \\partial _",
    "{ \\nu } \\psi -1/2g_{\\mu \\nu}[\\partial ^{\\sigma } \\psi \\partial _ { \\sigma } \\psi + 2u(\\psi ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ t_{\\mu \\nu } ^{dust } & = & du_{\\mu } u_{\\nu }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    being @xmath34 the density of the dust and @xmath35 the four velocity of its particles .",
    "since the scalar field @xmath10 is time - dependent oscillating coherently around the minimum of its scalar potential , we can write @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) . in order to handle einstein s equations we average them during the period of a scalar oscillation ,",
    "that is , we take @xmath37>$ ] .",
    "this procedure gives the lowest order approximation for an oscillaton and we are left with time - independent differential equations@xcite ; in the notation of reference @xcite where the metric functions are written as @xmath38 we are looking only for @xmath39 terms of the metric and fields , which are the dominant ones . besides of einstein s equations there are two klein - gordon ( kg ) equations for the scalar fields ,    @xmath40    the kg on the left depends on time , but it can be shown that one can factorize an overall cosine - term and then the resulting differential equation is time - independent@xcite .",
    "then , starting from a spherically symmetric space - time , using the _ harmonic maps ansatz _ we were able to find a solution of the system . in few words , the main idea behind the harmonic maps ansatz is the reparametrization of the metric functions with convenient auxiliary functions which will obey a generalization of the laplace equation , along with some consistency relationships ; the latter are usually quite difficult to fulfill , and great care and intuition must be taken in order to get a system of equations both workable with and interesting enough @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the averaged einstein s field equations is    @xmath41    for the scalar field @xmath42 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath10 for the oscillaton we obtained is    @xmath43    where the function @xmath44 is given up to quadratures    @xmath45    being @xmath46 an asymptotic value of the tangential velocity of the test particles in our toy galaxy .",
    "the density of the dust is given by    @xmath47    finally , the corresponding line element reads    @xmath48    with @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a constant with the interpretation discussed below .",
    "this metric is singular at @xmath51 , but it has an event horizon at @xmath52 .",
    "this metric does not represent a black hole because it is not asymptotically flat . nevertheless , for regions where @xmath53 but @xmath54  the metric behaves like a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "inside of the horizon the pressure of the perfect fluid is not zero anymore , thus our toy model is valid only in regions outside of the horizon , where it could be an approximation of the galaxy .",
    "metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) is not asymptotically flat , but it has a natural cut off when the dark matter density equals the intergalactic density as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the dust density and the oscillaton scalar field potential depend on the value of the function @xmath44 .",
    "we find that @xmath44 goes very rapidly to a positive constant value , which depends on the boundary conditions one imposes .",
    "let its asymptotic value be @xmath55 when @xmath56 whose interpretation would be the asymptotic amplitude of @xmath30 .    in order to understand the other parameters of the metric ,",
    "let us proceed in the following way .",
    "it is believed that in a standard galaxy , the central object has a mass of @xmath57some @xmath58 far away from the center of the galaxy ,  say from @xmath59 up , the term @xmath60 . in this limit",
    "metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) becomes    @xmath61    this space - time is very similar to metric ( 18 ) of reference @xcite , but now with the potential    @xmath62    being both solutions the same in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that @xmath64 , recovering in this way the asymptotic results shown in @xcite .",
    "parameter @xmath65 is related to parameter @xmath65 of metric ( 21 ) in reference @xcite , where it acts as a gauge parameter .",
    "of course this metric is only valid far away from the center of the galaxy .",
    "with parameter @xmath65 it is now possible to fit quite well the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) could not only represent the exterior part of the galaxy , but it could be a good approximation for the core part of it as well .",
    "let us see this point .",
    "the rotation curves @xmath66 seen by an observer at infinity for a spherically symmetric metric are given by @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "for metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) such result reads    @xmath68    formula that allows one to fit observational curves . in figure 1",
    "it is shown the change of the rotation curve when the value of @xmath50 changes , and it is evident that such fact would affect only the kinematics in the central parts of the galaxy , exactly in the same way as the mass of the central object should do @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it calls the attention in figure 1 that there is a region where the velocity of test particles is near to zero , and in fact the rotation curve decays in a keplerian way .",
    "let us see what happens in such a region near the galactic center : the factor @xmath69 in @xmath70 is almost 1 for @xmath71 for reasonable values @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 , therefore the time - like geodesics are determined by the factor @xmath75 .",
    "under such condition the contribution of @xmath30 is accurately zero for an observer far away from the galaxy .",
    "the interesting situation comes after calculating the density of all the components to the central density , it reads    @xmath76    where the approximation @xmath77 and @xmath78 is considered to be valid for reasonable values of the parameters .",
    "moreover , we can infer that the total energy density as seen by an observer far away from the center of the galaxy diverges when @xmath79 approaches to zero and goes rapidly to zero as @xmath80 when @xmath63 .",
    "but an observer at infinity measures the mass of the central object , it has not the possibility to distinguish between the density of each component .",
    "now let us explore an adm - like concept of mass associated to the central region ; we stress that metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) is not asymptotically flat and therefore the @xmath81 concept of mass strictly fails to be valid , so we recall that there is a region into the interval @xmath82 geometrically almost flat , where we will define a useful infinity @xmath83 that should serve to calculate the mass of the central configuration through the standard metric    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is interpreted as the mass function and @xmath86 as the gravitational potential .",
    "this form of the metric is convenient because in this coordinates @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the total density of the object .",
    "this interpretation is correct in regions where the space - time is almost flat , i.e. far away from the horizon @xmath52 .",
    "close to the horizon or inside of it , function @xmath89 is a quantity that should be similar to the mass of the object , but it is not since it contains the contribution of all the components together ; in this region , where the curvature of the space - time is huge , the volume element is different from @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , inside of the horizon we are not able to know the real physics of the object . on the other side , far away from the center of the toy galaxy , this function can be interpreted as the mass of an infinitesimal shell at radius @xmath79 .",
    "anyway we will call function @xmath89 the mass function everywhere .",
    "thus , the adm - like mass is obtained by @xmath91 .",
    "we perform the coordinate transformation @xmath92 , @xmath93  in order to compare metrics ( [ met_bosones ] ) and ( [ estand ] ) .",
    "we obtain    @xmath94    with @xmath64 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "probably an observer at any huge @xmath79 would see the mass @xmath97  at the center of the galaxy .",
    "there is a strong reason to consider with reserv the analysis near the horizon : we are considering a time averaged photograph of the space - time , which in the center would be strongly time dependent due to the presence of the oscillaton , and the stationarity fails to be a good approximation , thus it is not possible to know under the present approach which are the exact roles played by the binding energy of the oscillaton , the negative energy of the dust and the self - energy of the whole central system ; such features could be known by performing the evolution of einstein s equations and in fact represent a topic itself which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    for this model",
    ", there is a contributor which does not fulfill the energy conditions , this is the reason to call it `` toy model '' , although an observer at infinity will see the sum of all energy densities of the components .",
    "in other words , the amount of matter , with negative or positive energy density , is the quantity which determines the value of @xmath98 , the `` balck hole mass '' concentrated at radius @xmath79  of the toy galaxy , not the contributors separately .",
    "only if the observer could measure the contributions of the energy density very close to the center of the galaxy , it could recognize them . at infinity ,",
    "the observer will only measure @xmath97 , i.e. it will see a black - hole - like metric at the center of the galaxy which horizon lies at @xmath99 .",
    "we present in figure 2 the situation when parameter @xmath65 takes different values , playing thus the role of the core radius in the usual dark halo hypothesis . here",
    "we show that for an observer at infinity , the test particles close to the galaxy center behave as if there were a black hole of mass @xmath97 in the center .",
    "the event horizon avoids that this observer could see inside of the horizon surface , the velocity of test particles is higher for closer test particles and the rotation velocity decays as @xmath100 in this region . for particles far away from the center ,",
    "the rotation curves behave just as the rotation curves given by the contribution of the dark matter halo in a typical galaxy .       in figure 3",
    "the fit of the curves is done using the observed rotation curves of some dwarf galaxies , whose dark matter contribution is extremely dominating and therefore are considered as the _ test of fire _ for a dark matter model in galaxies . in general , for disc galaxies , the fit  of the rotation curves using this metric is analogous to that in reference @xcite .",
    "it seems then that metric ( [ met_bosones ] ) is a good approximation for some late stadium of the space - time of a spiral galaxy ; it is a good approximation of a `` long exposition photograph '' of a galaxy .",
    "the configuration we found is as follows : in the innermost region of the toy galaxy , it lies a time averaged oscillaton and dust , providing the picture of an object very similar to a black hole for an observer far away .",
    "moreover , the resting scalar field should accommodate in the outer parts .",
    "this picture is precisely very similar to the one required for a current galaxy , which center would be dominated by a supermassive object and it should posses a halo region dominated by the presence of dark matter . the corresponding line element ( [ met_bosones ] )",
    "is free of naked singularities and is not asymptotically flat .",
    "instead , it behaves exactly as a black hole near the coordinate center and it is asymptotically constructed to provide the _ flat curve condition _ @xcite .",
    "the main difference between this results and previous research supporting the scalar field dark matter hypothesis in galaxies , is precisely that in this case we have been able to extend the solution towards the galactic core .",
    "we have shown two important statements : first , an averaged spherically symmetric source field exists that supports a real scalar field under the assumption of non asymptotic flatness .",
    "second , a fully relativistic treatment is able to explain the kinematic of test particles in the whole background space - time of a galaxy at once .",
    "therefore , we believe that the metric presented here could be a first approximation of the galactic space - time provided the presence of coherent field ( a bose - einstein condensate ) instead of usual matter .",
    "even when our solution accounts for negative energy densities of some components , observers at infinity are not able to know it .",
    "furthermore , for such observers the test particles around the central object behave as if there would be a black hole of mass @xmath97 ."
