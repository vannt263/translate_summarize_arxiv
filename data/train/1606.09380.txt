    "@xmath0 violation is an important topic in particle physics . within the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 violation",
    "is originated from the weak phase in the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , along with the strong phase which usually arises from strong interactions @xcite .",
    "in the past few years more attention has been focused on the decays of @xmath6 meson system both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "some events of @xmath7 mesons have been observed at tevatron .",
    "fortunately , a great number of events will appear at lhc in the foreseeable future .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration focused on three - body decays channels of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to probe large @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "the intriguing discoveries present us opportunities to detect @xmath0 violation mechanism .",
    "the research of three - body decays of @xmath10 meson may be next topic for the lhcb experiments in the following years .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the interference from intermediate @xmath11 and @xmath4 mesons in the @xmath7 meson decays",
    ".    there has been remarkable progress in the study of exclusive @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays , where @xmath14 are light pseudo - scalar and/or vector mesons .",
    "historically , these decays were calculated in the so - called naive factorization approach  @xcite , which was improved by including perturbative qcd contributions  @xcite .",
    "currently , there are three popular theoretical approaches to study the dynamics of these decays , which go under the name qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite , and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "all three are based on power expansion in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-quark mass .",
    "factorization of the hadronic matrix elements @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is typically a four - quark or a magnetic moment type operator , is shown to exist in the leading power in @xmath15 in a class of decays .",
    "but , these methods are different significantly due to the collinear degree or transverse momenta .",
    "the power counting is different from the hard kernels between qcdf and pqcd .",
    "it is important to extract the strong phase difference for @xmath0 violation .",
    "the more different feature of qcdf and pqcd is the strong interaction scale at which of pqcd is low , typically of order @xmath20 gev , the case of qcdf is order @xmath21 for the wilson coefficients .",
    "direct @xmath0 violating asymmetries in b - hadron decays occur through the interference of at least two amplitudes with the weak phase difference @xmath22 and the strong phase difference @xmath23 .",
    "the weak phase difference is determined by the ckm matrix , while the strong phase is usually difficult to control . in order to acquire a large @xmath0",
    "violating asymmetries signal , we need to apply some phenomenological mechanism to obtain a large @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown that the charge symmetry violating mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath4 can be used to obtain a large strong phase difference which is required for large @xmath0 violating asymmetries @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the @xmath0 violation via @xmath2 mixing using pqcd approach in the decays of @xmath10 mesons .    in the perturbative qcd approach , at the rest frame of heavy @xmath6 meson",
    ", @xmath6 meson decays into two heavy quarks with large momenta .",
    "the hard interaction dominants the decay amplitude from short distance due to not enough time to exchange soft gluons with final mesons .",
    "since the final mesons move very fast , a hard gluon kicks the light spectator quark of @xmath6 meson to form a fast moving final meson .",
    "hence , the hard interaction is consist of six quark operator .",
    "the non - perturbative dynamics are included in the meson wave function which can be extracted from experiment .",
    "the hard one can be calculated by perturbation theory .",
    "since @xmath10 meson has two heavy quarks ( b and c quark ) , each of them can decay individually .",
    "it has been pointed out the c - quark decay processes can only produce about 1% @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "hence , we only consider the contribution of b - quark decay in the processes that we are considering .",

    "the decay amplitude is then factorized into the convolution of the hard subamplitude , the wilson coefficient and the sudakov factor with the meson wave functions , all of which are well - defined and gauge invariant .",
