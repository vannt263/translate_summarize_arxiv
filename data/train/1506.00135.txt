    "optics has contributed to the fundamental test and development of quantum mechanics from its dawn .",
    "it is mainly because photons can have a large energy scale so that they are robust to thermal noise and interact with matters via coherent multi - photon processes . especially , an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) @xcite is a good tool to investigate quantum - mechanical effects , since the photon pair generated in the phase - matched quadratic process @xcite is correlated due to the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "there has been vast theoretical and experimental literature on squeezing @xcite , entanglement @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite based on opos . and",
    "now , applications of this device to state - of - the - art technologies such as frequency combs @xcite , coherent feedback control @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite is a new and important direction .    inspired by the quantum simulators @xcite and the concept of the bosonic system with artificial feedback @xcite to simulate the ising spin system , we have proposed and examined the systems called `` coherent ising machines '' @xcite , which are networks based on optical oscillators with mutual injections . in these machines ,",
    "each ising spin is emulated by the field of each oscillator .",
    "also , the ising hamiltonian is mapped to the effective photonic loss of the whole system which is equivalent to the sum of the gain coefficients of all the oscillators .",
    "when the machine is gradually pumped from below the oscillation threshold , it is expected that the system oscillates with the minimum gain balancing the loss , and the resulting state corresponds to the ground state of the simulated hamiltonian .",
    "we first have proposed the machine based on injection - locked lasers @xcite .",
    "however , lasers usually do not have a fixed phase for their coherent fields to a certain reference , thus the polarization or phase states of them can not be binary as the ising spins",
    ". however , in the ising machine based on degenerate opos ( dopos ) @xcite , each dopo above the threshold takes one of the binary phase states , thus they can be utilized to simulate the ising spins .",
    "simulation results show that it can find the ground states of all the instances of the anti - ferromagnetic ising model ( the max - cut problem ) on cubic graphs with up to twenty spins . in an experimental demonstration @xcite ,",
    "a network of four opos successfully solved a problem of frustrated spins .",
    "an open question is if such coherent ising machines have quantum features , and exploit them for their computation . in the quantum computation framework , theoretical evidences promise computational powers beyond the rich of conventional digital computers @xcite .",
    "however , the previous theoretical models of the coherent ising machines , introduced for benchmarking , are based on the semi - classical approach .",
    "although such a model can deal with up to the quadratic squeezing process , a doubled - variable phase space representation is needed to consider further non - classical effects such as macroscopic superposition and entanglement @xcite .    in this paper , we study a fully quantum mechanical model for the system of two dopos with mutual injections using the positive @xmath0 representation @xcite .",
    "we extend the model for a single dopo @xcite by adding the signal cavity mode in the mutual injection path between the facets of the two dopos .",
    "we recognize that the previous work on parametric oscillators @xcite and harmonic oscillators @xcite assumes local evanescent - type couplings . in our work , however , we consider a nonlocal and dissipative coupling via the full - quantum model , in which the auxiliary system operators , as well as the primary oscillator operators , are treated by the rigorous description . for the simulation , a series of stochastic differential equations for the signal modes are derived .",
    "additionally , it is verified that the adiabatic elimination of the injection path results in the standard linear injection terms for the field variables .",
    "numerical simulations on the gradually pumped system with out - of - phase mutual injections are performed .",
    "when the dissipation in the mutual injection path is moderate , the intracavity fields of the two dopos near the oscillation threshold can be entangled due to the quantum correlation between the squeezed quadrature amplitudes @xmath2 , which is estimated via gaussian quantum discord @xcite . when the whole system is sufficiently closed , the injection path stores a squeezed vacuum . in this case , the entanglement is destroyed by enhanced fluctuations in the anti - squeezed quadrature amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "however , the weak fringes of the distribution functions of @xmath4 in the transition indicate that macroscopic superposition of zero - phase and @xmath5-phase exists in the dopos even with a small nonlinear pump noise .",
    "this suggests that the squeezed vacuum stored in the mutual injection path protects the macroscopic superposition from decoherence @xcite .",

    "in this section , we discuss other theoretical schemes to simulate the system considered here , the validity of the simulation in this study , and the possible contribution of the quantum effects in the system to the performance of the coherent ising machines .",
    "first , we refer to the difficulty in the simulation in this study with other theoretical schemes . regarding a numerical analysis for an open quantum system , direct integration on the master equation with the fock state basis",
    "is the most standard method as investigated in the previous relevant studies @xcite .",
    "it treats a series of ordinary differential equations for the components of the density matrix for the system .",
    "single - shot numerical integration for them gives all the information of the solution , thus we do not have to repeat stochastic simulations or take ensemble averages over a number of samples .",
    "also , it is relatively easy to get a good accuracy in numerical integration of an ordinary differential equation .",
    "however , the basis has an infinite number of eigenstates hence we have to truncate some of them . here",
    ", the more photons possible in the system , the more eigenstates needed .",
    "in addition , the number of modes crucially affects the complexity of the simulation .",
    "when we consider two dopos and the injection path with @xmath236 eigenstates for each , the number of components of the density matrix is @xmath237 .",
    "this amounts to unrealistic numbers such as @xmath238 and @xmath239 thus the simulation with the parameters here will be too costly .",
    "solving the fokker - planck equation will be useful if we can find a potential solution .",
    "however , it supposes a system at the steady state thus can not treat the transient regime , which is thought to be important for a dopo to have macroscopic superposition components @xcite .",
    "also , when the mutual injection path is explicitly considered , we will not be able to find a potential solution .",
    "the linearized analysis has been used to investigate the output squeezing spectra for the quadrature amplitudes of a dopo @xcite and the entanglement between the output fields of two dopos coupled with evanescent coupling @xcite .",
    "we can apply this method to get some information about the intracavity fields of the dopos . however , this is also limited in the steady state , and basically gives a result in the frequency domain . to consider the properties in the time domain",
    ", we have to integrate the noise spectra over the entire frequency space . here , a well - known relation between the covariance of input and output bosonic operators @xcite is not satisfied .",
    "it is because the input field for each dopo originating from the mutual injections is not a coherent or vacuum state but a squeezed state .",
    "straightforward application of this relation results in negative values in the spectrum of @xmath240 .",
    "thus , reconsideration on the theoretical model might be required .",
    "next , we discuss the stability of the simulation in this study .",
    "we recognize that the positive @xmath0 representation can give unreliable results in some cases @xcite .",
    "however , the simulation here is considered to be relatively stable , because the dynamics of the variables are mostly bounded in a finite manifold . in the theoretical model ,",
    "the pump modes are adiabatically eliminated .",
    "this significantly helps dopo fields be bounded as ref",
    ". pointed .",
    "it is also supported by the fact that the fokker - planck equation for a single dopo with the adiabatic elimination has the solution @xcite which comprises gaussian components decaying exponentially in the phase space . in addition , a real and diagonal diffusion amplitude matrix assists them to be real .",
    "the classical solution and the gradual pumping scheme also help the variables be bounded .",
    "thus , the simulations here are not thought to be largely affected by the instability of the dynamics in the complex phase space .",
    "nevertheless , the mutual injection path can enhance the numerical error of the simulation , especially when its loss @xmath112 is quite small .",
    "as mentioned , a relaxation oscillation might be a sign for the unreliability of the simulation .",
    "we have not seen large variance in the amplified quantities such as the photon number , the correlation , and fluctuation for @xmath192 . however , those for the squeezed amplitude @xmath4 directly reflects the feature of the noise in the system .",
    "thus , it can be difficult to acquire a good accuracy for them .",
    "we see that the curves for them with @xmath188 in the first case and @xmath189 in the second have large fluctuations , around which the simulation might be unreliable @xcite .",
    "thus , we have taken @xmath209 , @xmath222 and 200,000 samples for the distribution functions to avoid large numerical errors .",
    "the critical fluctuations around the oscillation can also be another difficulty because the range of the variables here is big due to a small @xmath117 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the noise in @xmath4 is rather decreased there , and that in @xmath192 does not diverge in principle because the nonlinear pump depletion is fully taken into account here . to reduce the number of samples by removing unexpected correlation in the noise terms and the instability ,",
    "the introduction of the gauge terms @xcite might be needed .      finally , we comment on the possibilities that the quantum features in the dopos contribute to the performance of the coherent ising machine , which is a dopo network with mutual injections emulating the ising model .",
    "we have seen different quantum effects for different parameter regimes .",
    "first , the system shows transient macroscopic superposition around the oscillation threshold when it has a small loss compared to the oscillator mirror loss @xmath30 .",
    "the coherent ising machine assigns the up and down spin states to the discrete phase states @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "it is expected to oscillate in a phase configuration with the small total gain , which corresponds to the ground state of the ising hamiltonian . for an efficient ground - state search , the network has to avoid being trapped in local minima , whose number scales exponentially with the problem size in hard instances .",
    "the macroscopic superposition under gradual pumping holds the information of all the states in the whole system simultaneously and can potentially help the system search for the minimum gain mode at the onset of the oscillation .",
    "this is similar to the quantum parallelism in quantum computers .",
    "second , a loss of the mutual injections comparable to @xmath30 leads to the quantum correlation in terms of the squeezed amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "further investigations are required to clarify its effect on the performance of the machine .",
    "we have founded and simulated a fully quantum mechanical model of the system of two dopos with the mutual injections .",
    "the field between the two dopo facets is introduced as a cavity mode to treat the input - output relation and the field confinement in the mutual injection path .",
    "the model can be extended easily to the case of a larger network .",
    "we have shown that the linear mutual injection terms in the positive @xmath0 representation are derived _ ab initio _ in the limit where the dynamics of the injection path is neglected .",
    "the detailed simulation results for the case of out - of - phase coupling revealed that the gradually pumped system could have quantum correlation , entanglement and macroscopic superposition components .",
    "the quantum correlation and entanglement require noise - free mutual injections with moderate loss in its path . on the other hand , additional quantum noise stored in the low - loss injection path",
    "is rather essential to generate macroscopic superposition components in the dopos .",
    "this means that the closed injection path with squeezed vacuum inputs alleviates decoherence in the dopos .",
    "quantum effects in such a simple setup may also play a role not only in a coherent ising machine but also in broader contexts such as nano- and opto - mechanics , circuit qed and superconducting devices .",
