    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in iron based compounds by kamihara _ _ et al.__@xcite has increased interest and intensified efforts to find superconductors in new families of compounds .",
    "these efforts have focused on searching for materials with structural , electronic and magnetic properties similar to those of the iron or cuprate superconductors . in particular , the ideal candidates are thought to be materials with a layered structure that are in proximity to a spin - density wave ( sdw ) instability due to fermi surface nesting like in the iron based superconductors or a mott insulating phase due to strong on - site coulomb repulsion as in the cuprates .",
    "recently , yajima _ et al .",
    "_  have reported superconductivity in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o with a @xmath1 of 1.2 k.@xcite superconductivity in ba@xmath2na@xmath3ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o with a maximum @xmath1 of 5.5 k has also been reported by doan _ _ et al.__@xcite in addition to the superconducting transition , there is also an anomaly at @xmath4 = 54 k that manifests by showing strong features in the measurements of susceptibility , resistivity , and specific heat . the microscopic mechanism and the order parameter for this transition",
    "have not been determined but been ascribed to either a charge - density wave ( cdw ) or sdw instability .",
    "furthermore , the superconducting phase coexists with this cdw or sdw phase .",
    "this compound occurs in a tetragonal structure with space group @xmath5 and consists of square planes of transition element ti .",
    "the o atoms are placed alternately at the center of the ti squares such that each ti atom has two o nearest neighbors .",
    "the sb atoms are placed above and below the center of the ti squares that do not contain o atoms .",
    "the ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o layers are stacked alternately with layers of ba atoms along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "this layered structure is similar to the iron based or cuprate superconductors as all of them have square planes of transition - metal atoms as a structural motif .",
    "in addition , singh has further highlighted similarities in the electronic and magnetic properties between bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o and the iron superconductors based on first principles calculations.@xcite the fermi surface shows substantial nesting and leads to an antiferromagnetic instability as in the case of iron superconductors .",
    "this nested fermi surface is consistent with the results of pickett on a similar compound na@xmath0sb@xmath0ti@xmath0o , although he was unable to find a magnetically ordered state.@xcite the electronic structure of na@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o was also studied by de biani _ et al . _  using tight - binding calculations , and they also find substantial nesting in the fermi surface that may lead to a cdw instability.@xcite    in any case , the presence of a nested fermi surface and antiferromagnetic instability in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o leads singh to predict a spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity similar to that of the iron based superconductors.@xcite the pairing state is predicted to have a sign - changing @xmath7-wave symmetry that is different from that of the iron based superconductors .",
    "furthermore , spin fluctuations are repulsive in the singlet channel and hence are strongly pair - breaking for the attractive electron - phonon interaction .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that the superconductivity in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o is mediated by spin fluctuations , especially if the phase transition at @xmath4 = 54 k that coexists with the superconducting phase is due to sdw instability .",
    "however , there are some differences between bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o and other superconductors near magnetism .",
    "the maximum @xmath1 = 5.5 k of this compound is significantly smaller than that of the iron based or cuprate superconductors .",
    "this could be due to a small value of the stoner parameter for ti@xcite or pair - breaking effects of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath8 , which is purported to be an unconventional superconductor,@xcite also has a small @xmath1 of 1 k.@xcite a more glaring difference is the very sensitive dependence of superconductivity on other constituent elements of the compound .",
    "a transition similar to the one in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o is also seen in other members of the family that includes na@xmath0ti@xmath0@xmath9@xmath0o ( @xmath9 = as , sb ) , bati@xmath0as@xmath0o , ( srf)@xmath0ti@xmath0@xmath9@xmath0o ( @xmath9 = as , sb ) , and ( smo)@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o,@xcite but superconductivity has so far only been observed in na doped bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o .",
    "this is in contrast to iron superconductors which exhibit superconductivity for a wide variety of cations and pnictogens . in the cuprates",
    ", superconductivity is also found for a wide variety of interlayer fillings that separate the cuo@xmath0 layers . even in the ruthenates , doping at the cation site or changing the interlayer spacing reveals various magnetic interactions .",
    "this suggests that the magnetism and mechanism for superconductivity in doped bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o are quite different from those of other unconventional superconductors , and perhaps lattice instabilities and electron - phonon coupling play important roles .",
    "in this paper , i present the results of first principles calculations that show presence of a cdw instability and a total electron - phonon coupling strong enough to yield a conventional superconductivity in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o .",
    "the phonon dispersions reveal a weak lattice instability near the brillouin zone corners .",
    "this instability is associated with the elongation or compression of the ti squares without an enclosed o such that the ti squares with an o rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise by a small amount .",
    "i also find presence of strong electron - phonon couplings , especially near the zone corners .",
    "the total electron - phonon coupling @xmath10 = 1.28 for the undistorted structure or @xmath10 = 0.55 for the distorted structure is large enough to readily explain the superconductivity in this material .",
    "the phonon dispersions and electron - phonon results presented here were obtained using density - functional perturbation theory@xcite within the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof@xcite as implemented in the quantum - esspresso package.@xcite i used the experimental lattice parameters ( @xmath11 = 4.11039 and c = 8.0864 )@xcite but relaxed the internal sb height parameter @xmath12 .",
    "i obtained a value for @xmath12 = 0.2493 , which agrees well with both the experimental@xcite and calculated@xcite values .",
    "this is in contrast to the underestimation from density functional calculations found in the iron based superconductors.@xcite this indicates that magnetism and/or lattice dynamics in bati@xmath0sb@xmath0o might be different from those of the iron based superconductors .",

    "there is also a small electron sheet around the zone center that has a mixed character .",
    "singh calculated the real part of the susceptibility within the constant matrix element approximation and finds peaks in the susceptibility due to substantial nesting between fermi sheets , especially near the @xmath24 vector @xmath40 ( 2@xmath41 ) .",
    "in addition , there is also a smaller peak near the @xmath24 vector @xmath42 ( 2@xmath41 ) .",
    "this could lead to magnetic instabilities at these @xmath24 vectors , although the height of the peaks could be diminished when the matrix element is explicitly taken into account in the calculation of the susceptibility . in any case",
