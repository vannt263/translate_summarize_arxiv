    "<S> this contribution to the cpt16 meeting provides a brief overview of recent studies of nonminimal lorentz violation in the standard - model extension .    </S>",
    "<S> ps . </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#1 # 1#2 # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1|#1| # 1#2     # 1c^(#1 ) # 1 # 1#2_#1y_#2 # 1#2#3k^(#1)_(#2)#3 # 1#2 # 1#2 # 1#2 # 1#2    the standard - model extension ( sme ) provides a general field - theoretic description of violations of lorentz and cpt invariance in particle physics and in gravity and has facilitated hundreds of experimental tests of these fundamental symmetries.@xcite a lorentz - violating term in the lagrangian of the sme is constructed from a tensor coefficient contracted with a conventional tensor operator , giving contributions to the action that schematically take the form @xmath0 the coefficients for lorentz violation give the vacuum a non - scalar structure and act as lorentz - violating background fields . </S>",
    "<S> the various violations are often classified according to the mass dimension @xmath1 of the associated operator .    </S>",
    "<S> early development of the sme focused largely on minimal violations  those involving lorentz - violating operators with renormalizable mass dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3  leading to the so - called minimal sme ( msme ) . </S>",
    "<S> pioneering works constructed the minimal modifications to the standard model of particle physics@xcite followed by general relativity.@xcite while the msme has served as the theoretical basis for a vast majority of lorentz tests performed to date,@xcite more recent efforts aim at exploring nonminimal violations associated with operators of mass dimensions @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these include the construction of the full nonminimal extensions for free photons,@xcite neutrinos,@xcite free dirac fermions,@xcite and linearized gravity.@xcite    the study of lorentz - violating operators of nonrenormalizable dimensions can be motivated through simple dimensional analysis . for operators of dimension @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients for lorentz violation have mass dimension @xmath5 . assuming a connection to planck - scale physics </S>",
    "<S> , we might naively expect coefficients that are of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> this type of suppression gives the sme the structure of a series approximation , which fits well with the notion that it represents the low - energy limit of some underlying high - energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that conventional lorentz - invariant physics ( the standard model and general relativity ) corresponds to the dominant leading - order terms in the series . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz - violating terms in the sme give higher - order corrections , which decrease in size with higher dimension @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes sense for nonminimal violations with @xmath4 , but is problematic for minimal violations , where @xmath8 violations would be unsuppressed and @xmath2 violations would be very large . </S>",
    "<S> minimal violations would be easily detected in this picture and precluded by their absence . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - order lorentz violations would then be nonminimal ones with mass dimension @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> while the msme has been tested extensively , the nonminimal parts of the sme remain relatively unexplored , with most of the parameter space unconstrained and completely open to future experimentation . at present , constraints on nonminimal lorentz violation in photons include tests involving vacuum birefringence,@xcite vacuum dispersion,@xcite and resonant cavities.@xcite in neutrinos , there are constraints from oscillation experiments@xcite and kinematical tests involving high - energy astrophysical neutrinos.@xcite for heavier fermions , current constraints on nonminimal violations come from studies of muonic atoms@xcite and hydrogen - like atoms.@xcite bounds on nonminimal lorentz violation in gravity have been obtained in tests of short - range gravity,@xcite from limits on gravitational erenkov radiation in cosmic rays,@xcite and from limits on birefringence in gravitational waves.@xcite    the different sectors of the nonminimal sme share some common features , which we illustrate here by considering the recently constructed nonminimal extension for linearized general relativity.@xcite the lagrangian for this extension , in term of the metric perturbation @xmath9 , can be written @xmath10 where the first term is the usual lorentz - invariant part . the term involving the tensor operator @xmath11 contains cpt - even lorentz violations for even @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 gives cpt - odd violations with odd @xmath4 , and @xmath14 gives cpt - even violations with even @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> each of the tensor operators represents an infinite series of derivatives . for example </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 is given by the expansion @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion coefficients @xmath18 are constant and control the lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> the differing symmetries of the coefficients in each class result in different physical consequences .    the minimal version of the above theory is obtained by restricting attention to @xmath8 @xmath11 terms , which has the effect of demoting the operator @xmath11 to the constant @xmath19 . in other sectors of the sme , going the other way , from the minimal to the nonminimal extension , is effectively the reverse of this procedure . in almost every case </S>",
    "<S> , the introduction of nonminimal violations can be viewed as the promotion of minimal @xmath20 coefficients from constants to operators.@xcite the exception is linearized general relativity , where the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 lack minimal counterparts .    </S>",
    "<S> the power of the sme lies in its ability to give theoretically consistent predictions for almost any system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with the theory in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lag ] ) we can examine the effects of general lorentz violation on gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> a key result is the modified dispersion relation , @xmath21 , which predicts several unconventional features , including dispersion and birefringence . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 parameters are complicated momentum - dependent combinations of the coefficients for lorentz violation . however , as in many other practical applications of the sme , the problem can be made tractable by performing a spherical - harmonic decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> this aids in the cataloging of the many lorentz - violating effects that can arise . </S>",
    "<S> it also significantly simplifies the rotations between noninertial laboratory frames and the inertial sun - centered frame conventionally used for reporting results.@xcite    in the current example , the spherical expansion of the @xmath22 parameters is @xmath23 the spherical coefficients for lorentz violation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 completely characterize the leading - order effects of lorentz violation in gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the @xmath24 coefficients have been bounded by the apparent absence of gravitational erenkov radiation in cosmic rays.@xcite the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 coefficients are constrained by limits on birefringence in gravitational waves.@xcite    note that the above expansion involves spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> these are similar to the familiar harmonics @xmath29 , but carry spin weight @xmath30 , which is equivalent to helicity , up to a sign . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the @xmath31 harmonics in the above example stems from the spin-2 nature of gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> the violations associated with the @xmath32 harmonics couple the @xmath33-helicity waves , leading to changes of @xmath34 in helicity . similarly , the @xmath35 harmonics arise for spin-1 photons in the sme,@xcite and @xmath36 harmonics appear in the spherical expansions for spin-@xmath37 fermions.@xcite </S>"
