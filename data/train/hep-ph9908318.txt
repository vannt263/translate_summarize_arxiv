    "an important role in non  perturbative approaches to qcd is played by the gauge invariant non  local gluon field strength correlator @xmath0 where the field strength @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denotes path ordering of the exponential . in general , the gauge invariant field strength correlator could be defined with an arbitrary gauge string connecting the end points @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but in this work we shall restrict ourselves to a straight line .",
    "it is the basic ingredient in the stochastic model of the qcd vacuum @xcite and in the description of high energy hadron - hadron scattering @xcite . in the spectrum of heavy quark",
    "bound states it governs the effect of the gluon condensate on the level splittings @xcite and it is useful for the determination of the spin dependent parts in the heavy quark potential @xcite .",
    "the correlator can be related to a correlator of a colour singlet current composed of a ( fictitious ) infinitely heavy octet quark and the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "this fact has already been employed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to calculate the perturbative corrections by means of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) . in this work",
    "we again use this relation to estimate the correlation length from qcd sum rules @xcite using as ingredients the value of the gluon condensate and the results for the perturbative calculation .",
    "instead of dealing with the non  local string operator which makes a calculation rather tedious one can replace the string by local heavy quark fields and use the methods developed in hqet . to this aim",
    ", we introduce an infinitely heavy quark field in the octett representation , @xmath6 , which is constructed from the field @xmath7 analogous to hqet by @xmath8 @xmath9 is the four  velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the propagator of the free heavy quark field in coordinate space is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the zero  component of the velocity .",
    "the @xmath12function constrains the heavy quark on a straight line . with the effective hqet action @xmath13",
    ", the following equation can be shown analytically @xcite : @xmath14 the physical picture of this result is a heavy quark moving from point @xmath4 to @xmath5 with a four  velocity @xmath9 , acquiring a phase proportional to the path  ordered exponential .",
    "the limit of @xmath15 is necessary in order to constrain the heavy quark on a straight line and in order to decouple the spin interactions which are suppressed by a power of @xmath16 and can therefore be neglected . by introducing a new correlator @xmath17",
    ", we can now express our correlator ( [ eq:1 ] ) in terms of heavy quark fields @xmath18 which establishes the relation between the field strength correlator and hqet .",
    "our next aim is to evaluate this correlator in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite and in that way obtain information on the correlation length of the field strength correlator .",
    "we may view the composite operator @xmath19 as an interpolating field of colourless quark gluon hybrids and evaluate @xmath20 by introducing these as intermediate states in the absorption part of @xmath20 .",
    "the lowest lying state will govern the long  range behaviour and hence the inverse of its energy is the correlation length .    for the sum rule analysis it is preferable to work with the correlator in momentum space .",
    "thus we define @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the residual heavy quark momentum .    for a sum rule analysis",
    "the states have to be classified according to different quantum numbers .",
    "the projections onto the two independent subspaces is done with @xmath23 where @xmath24 contains a vector and @xmath25 an axialvector intermediate state .",
    "we model the correlators by a contribution from the lowest lying resonance plus the perturbative continuum above a threshold @xmath26 . inserting the matrix elements and performing the heavy quark phase space integrals",
    "one obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the energy of the glue around the heavy quark , @xmath29 are the hadronic matrix elements and @xmath30 are constants .",
    "the spectral densities are defined by @xmath31 and are known at the next  to  leading order @xcite .",
    "after fourier transformation to coordinate space the above representation reads : @xmath32 since the heavy quark propagator factorises , we identify the expression inside the brackets with our original correlator @xmath33 .",
    "the long  range behaviour will be dominated by the term containing the exponential with the energy @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the correlator decays exponentially and the correlation length is given by @xmath34 .",
    "now we turn to the theoretical side of the sum rules which is obtained by calculating the correlator of eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) in the framework of the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "the perturbative contributions in momentum space have the form @xmath35 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the coefficients @xmath38 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "essential for the sum rule analysis are the contributions coming from the condensates . in our case",
    "the dimension three condensate @xmath39 vanishes since the quark mass is infinite .",
    "the lowest nonvanishing term is the gluon condensate of dimension four : @xmath40 the next condensate contribution would be of dimension six , but we shall neglect all higher condensate contributions in this work and restrict ourselves to the gluon condensate .",
    "the correlators satisfy homogeneous renormalisation group equations .",
    "thus we can improve the perturbative expressions by resumming the logarithmic contributions .",
    "calculation of the first coefficients @xmath41 for the anomalous dimensions from eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) leads to @xmath42 the correlator @xmath43 which corresponds to the vector intermediate state does not depend on the renormalisation scale @xmath44 at this order .    in order to suppress contributions in the dispersion integral coming from higher exited states and from higher dimensional condensates , it is convenient to apply a borel transformation @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the borel variable .",
    "after renormalisation group improvement and borel transformation all the ingredients needed for a sum rule analysis are known .",
    "explicit formulas for the expressions can be found in ref .",
    "now we turn to the numerical analysis .",
    "let us denote by @xmath47 the borel transformed expression for the continuum part @xmath48 . after equating the phenomenological and the theoretical part we end up with the sum rule @xmath49 by taking the logarithmic derivative we get an equation for the energy @xmath28 .",
    "the analysis shows that the different sign of the perturbative and non  perturbative term in the @xmath50 state leads to a stabilisation for the energy sum rule , whereas the equal sign in the @xmath51 state destabilises .    as our input parameters for the case of three light quark flavours we use @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . to estimate the errors we have varied the scale @xmath44 , the continuum threshold @xmath26 and the gluon condensate . in fig .",
    "1 we have displayed the energy @xmath55 as a function of the borel parameter @xmath46 for different values of @xmath44 and @xmath26 . a good balance between stability for the energy and sensitivity for the resonance is found around @xmath56 gev .    including the errors we get for the energy and correlation length @xmath57 in a world without light quarks , i.e. @xmath58 , the main influence is the expected change of the gluon condensate which might increase by a factor two to three @xcite .",
    "if we perform an analysis as above , we get for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 an energy and correlation length of @xmath62 for @xmath63 , the energy of the axial vector , we obtain no stable sum rule .",
    "the expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath63 are equal in lowest order perturbation theory , higher order perturbative contributions and the gluon condensate lead to a splitting in such a way that for the same values of @xmath26 and @xmath46 the expression for @xmath55 is higher than that for @xmath63 .",
    "the analysis of the gauge invariant gluon field strength correlator by qcd sum rules allows to establish a relation between the gluon condensate and the correlation length . in order to apply the sum rule technique which consists in the comparison of a phenomenological ansatz with a theoretical expression obtained from operator product expansion we interpret the gluon correlator as the correlator of two colour neutral hybrid states composed of a ( fictitious ) heavy quark transforming under the adjoint representation and a gluon field .",
    "the former serves as the source for the gauge string in the correlator .",
    "the value of the lowest intermediate @xmath50 state ( the inverse correlation length of the correlator ) with three flavours can be determined to @xmath64 and with zero flavours to @xmath65 .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty are the choice of the continuum threshold @xmath26 and the value of the gluon condensate .    though we find no stable sum rule for the axial vector state we have from the difference of the expressions for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 state strong evidence for the counterintuitive result that the @xmath51 state is lighter than the vector state .",
    "the field strength correlator has been calculated on the lattice using the cooling technique @xcite and field insertions into a wilson loop @xcite . for a discussion see ref .",
    "recently in an analysis of heavy quarkonium in the framework of nrqcd @xcite a splitting between the vector and the axialvector part has been observed in the same direction as proposed by the sum rules .",
    "the sum rule analysis shows that the state investigated here namely a gluon confined by an octet source has a much higher energy than a corresponding state in hqet . a similar analysis of a light quark bound by a source in the fundamental representation @xcite yielded an energy which is by a factor 2 to 4 smaller .",
    "this is to be expected from general grounds @xcite since the case treated here is nearer to a glueball than to a heavy meson ."
