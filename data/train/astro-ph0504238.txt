    "the first multisite photometric and spectrographic campaign devoted to the @xmath6 cephei star @xmath0 eridani was carried out between october 2002 and february 2003 .",
    "more than 600 h of differential @xmath11 photometry on 148 nights and more than 2000 high - resolution spectra were obtained .",
    "a frequency analysis of the photometric data was reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , while the spectrographic time - series and their analysis were presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) . an extended frequency analysis and mode identification was provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "seismic modelling of the oscillation spectrum of @xmath0 eri has been undertaken by @xcite and @xcite .    in paper",
    "i , the light - variation of @xmath0 eri was shown to consist of 23 sinusoidal terms .",
    "these included 8 independent ones with frequencies , @xmath12 , spanning the range from 5.6 to 7.9 d@xmath1 , 14 high - frequency combination terms , and a term with the low frequency @xmath13 d@xmath1 .",
    "the four highest - amplitude terms , discovered long ago by @xcite , consist of a singlet with frequency @xmath14 d@xmath1 , and a triplet very nearly equidistant in frequency ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 d@xmath1 ) . before the campaign it was known that the singlet was a radial mode @xcite , and surmised that it was the fundamental @xcite , but the true nature of the triplet was unclear . from multicolour photometry , @xcite derived @xmath7 for @xmath17 , and suggested that the triplet was a rotationally split dipole mode .",
    "this was challenged by @xcite who  from an analysis of line - profile variations  identified the @xmath18 term with an axisymmetric mode .",
    "however , both results are questionable because in neither case the triplet had been resolved .",
    "the matter was settled in paper iii : the wavelength dependence of the @xmath19 amplitudes of the triplet terms implies @xmath7 for all of them .",
    "@xcite showed then that the triplet was a @xmath20 mode .",
    "a frequency triplet @xmath21 can be characterized by its mean separation @xmath22 and asymmetry @xmath23 in case of a rotationally split triplet , @xmath24 is determined by the angular rotation rate of the star , @xmath25 , while @xmath26 is sensitive to effects of higher order in @xmath25 , as well as to effects of a magnetic field . if these effects are negligible , @xmath27 .    for the @xmath28 triplet ,",
    "both parameters were derived before the campaign from archival data by @xcite . the value of asymmetry they obtained , @xmath29 d@xmath1 , was unexpectedly large for the small rotation rate implied by the triplet s",
    "@xmath30 d@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite showed that this problem may be solved by postulating the existence of a 5 to 10 kg magnetic field in the outer envelope of the star . from the campaign data ( see paper iii ) , one gets @xmath31 d@xmath1 , a value which is not in serious conflict with the observed @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , the large standard deviation of this result makes it useless . a longer time base - line than that of the 2002 - 3 campaign would be needed to obtain a more reliable value of @xmath26 and thus decide whether invoking magnetic field were necessary .",
    "this was one motivation for undertaking the sequel campaign .    in paper iii , the spherical harmonic degree of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms",
    "was found to be @xmath7 , but an attempt to derive @xmath35 for the low - frequency @xmath36 term ( referred to as the @xmath37 term in that paper ) was unsuccessful because of its small @xmath19 amplitudes and the poor resolution of diagnostic diagrams at low frequencies .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath32 term is a @xmath38 mode , while the @xmath39 one is a @xmath40 mode .",
    "moreover , they suggested that the low - frequency term is an @xmath7 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 mode .    according to @xcite , only the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes ( i.e. , the radial fundamental mode and the @xmath47 triplet ) are unstable in standard models .",
    "modes with @xmath48 d@xmath1 ( i.e. , the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ones ) and the low - frequency mode are stable .",
    "@xcite demonstrate , however , that a fourfold overabundance of fe in the driving zone would account for excitation of the high - frequency modes , and would make the low - frequency mode marginally unstable",
    ".    it has been noted in paper i that if the low - frequency term were indeed a high - order @xmath5 mode , @xmath0 eri would be both a @xmath6 cephei variable and a slowly pulsating ( spb ) star .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath49 differs from the sixth order combination frequency @xmath50 by less than 0.003 d@xmath1 .",
    "this number is much larger than the formal error of @xmath49 , but is smaller than half the frequency resolution of the campaign data .",
    "thus , the possibility that @xmath49 is the combination frequency ",
    "although rather unlikely  cannot be rejected .",
    "again , a longer time base - line would help to settle the issue .",
    "in addition to extending the time base - line , the sequel campaign was expected to double the number of data points and thus lower the detection threshold so that modes having amplitudes too low to be seen in the 2002 - 3 frequency spectra could be discovered from the combined data .",
    "both comparison stars used in the 2002 - 3 photometric observations turned out to be variable . for the first ,",
    "@xmath8 eri ( hd30211 , b5iv , @xmath51 ) , the analysis carried out in paper i revealed a dominant frequency @xmath52 d@xmath1 .",
    "( from now on we shall use a prime to denote frequencies of @xmath8 eri . ) prewhitening with this frequency resulted in an amplitude spectrum with a very strong @xmath53 component , indicating a complex variation .",
    "since the star is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period @xmath54 d @xcite , tests have been made to detect a non - sinusoidal signal with this period .",
    "unfortunately , they were inconclusive .    taking into account the star s position in the hr diagram , the frequency @xmath55 of the dominant variation , and the fact that the @xmath2 amplitude was about a factor of two greater than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 amplitudes , it was concluded in paper i that @xmath8 eri is probably an spb star .",
    "however , it was also noted that instead of pulsation , a rotational modulation could be the cause of the dominant variation .    in paper",
    "i , the frequency analysis of de - trended differential magnitudes of @xmath8 eri revealed a small - amplitude variation with a frequency @xmath56 d@xmath1 .",
    "it was suggested that the second comparison star , @xmath9 eri ( hd27861 , a2v , @xmath57 ) , may be responsible .",
    "the present paper reports the sequel photometric campaign , carried out from 11 sept .  2003 to 16 feb .",
    "2004 , and an analysis of the data of both campaigns .",
    "the 2003 - 4 observations and reductions are described in sect .  2 .",
    "3 contains an account of the frequency analysis of the new data and a comparison of the results with those of paper i. low frequencies in the variation of @xmath8 and @xmath0 eri from the @xmath19 data of the first campaign are re - examined in sect .",
    "5 is devoted to frequency analysis of the combined , 2002 - 4 data .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "6 provides a summary with an emphasis on clues for asteroseismology of the three stars , @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 eri .",
    "the observations were carried out with five telescopes on four continents .",
    "an observing log is presented in table 1 .",
    "comparison of this table with table 1 of paper i shows that the new data are almost as extensive as the old ones .",
    "however , the 2003 - 4 @xmath4 data are less numerous than the @xmath3 and @xmath2 ones ( see below ) .",
    "the time base - lines of the 2002 - 3 and 2003 - 4 sets are very nearly the same ; they amount to 157.9 and 158.5 d for the old and new data , respectively .",
    "the five telescopes and photometers were the same as those in the 2002 - 3 campaign .",
    "thus , single - channel photoelectric photometers were used at all sites but sierra nevada observatory ( osn ) , where a simultaneous @xmath58 photometer was used . at osn",
    ", the observations were obtained with all four strmgren filters , at fairborn , lowell and siding spring , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at saao ,",
    "the @xmath4 filter used in the 2002 - 3 campaign has deteriorated to such a degree that it had to be discarded .",
    "since no replacement was available , the data were taken with two filters , strmgren @xmath2 and @xmath3 , except that on his first two nights ap used johnson filters b and v.    [ cols= \" < , > , > , < , > , > , < \" , ]     in sect .",
    "5.1 we have warned that @xmath59 may be in error by 1 y@xmath1 .",
    "if this were indeed the case , the values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 given in table 8 for the 12,6,7 triplet should be replaced by @xmath60 and @xmath61 d@xmath1 , respectively . because of this uncertainty , and the suspicion of a long - term variation of the amplitude of the @xmath39 term ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , the triplet is not particularly suitable for asteroseismology at this stage .",
    "fortunately , the other two triplets are well - behaved",
    ". there are no y@xmath1 uncertainties , even for the lowest - amplitude term of the 5,9,10 triplet , and no signs of long - term amplitude variation .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 spherical harmonic identification for all members of the large - amplitude triplet and the @xmath32 member of the 5,9,10 one are secure ( see paper iii or the introduction ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] , the @xmath62 and 10 members of the triplet have @xmath19 amplitude ratios consistent with @xmath35 equal to 1 or 2 . unfortunately , the standard deviations of the amplitude ratios , especially those of the smallest - amplitude member , are too large to fix @xmath35 unambiguously .     amplitude ratios for the small - amplitude members of the 7.91 d@xmath1 triplet ( circles with error bars ) compared with theoretical amplitude ratios for @xmath63 .",
    "the observed ratios are from the 2002 - 4 amplitudes ( see table 6 ) , the theoretical ones , from fig .  5 of paper iii .",
    "the open circles are shifted slightly in wavelength to avoid overlap . ]      as we mentioned in the introduction , the frequency resolution of the 2002 - 3 data was insufficient to reject the possibility that @xmath49 is equal to the combination frequency @xmath50 . as can be seen from table 6 , the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 amounts to 0.0030 d@xmath1 .",
    "this number is not only much larger than the standard deviation of @xmath49 , but also larger than the frequency resolution of the 2002 - 4 data by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "in fact , @xmath50 coincides with the @xmath65 y@xmath1 alias of @xmath49 .",
    "since the alias has about the same height as the @xmath66 y@xmath1 one , the combination frequency s amplitude must be below the detection threshold .",
    "consequently , there is no longer any doubt that @xmath49 is an independent low frequency in the variation of @xmath0 eri .",
    "in addition , we have found another low frequency , @xmath67 ( see tables 2 and 6 ) . since only high - order @xmath5 modes have frequencies that low , the suggestion put forward in paper i that @xmath0 eri were both a @xmath6 cep variable and an spb star is amply confirmed .      to the single frequency @xmath69 d@xmath1 , derived from the differential magnitudes ` @xmath8 eri @xmath70 @xmath9 eri ' in paper i , we add five further ones ( see table 7 ) .",
    "the values of the frequencies and the decrease of the @xmath19 amplitudes with increasing wavelength ( for at least four frequencies ) indicate that we are seeing high - radial - order @xmath5 modes .",
    "thus , as already suggested in paper i , the star is an spb variable .",
    "note that rotational modulation , the second hypothesis put forward in paper i for explaining the @xmath55 term is now untenable because it does not account for multiperiodicity .",
    "as can be seen from table 7 , the periods @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are equally spaced , with the spacing equal to @xmath74 d , while @xmath75 precedes @xmath71 by twice this value .",
    "the equal spacing in period may be a manifestation of the well - known asymptotic property of high - order @xmath5 modes of the same @xmath35 .",
    "there are , however , the following two problems with this idea : ( 1 )  the term half - way between the @xmath71 and @xmath75 ones is missing , and ( 2 )  the period - spacing is rather large .",
    "better data may solve the first problem if the missing term is simply too weak to be detected in our data .",
    "the second problem requires a comparison with the theory .",
    "unfortunately , the only spb - star model available in the literature @xcite has @xmath76 m@xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , whereas @xmath8 eri is more massive ( by @xmath80 m@xmath77 ) , more luminous ( by @xmath81 dex ) , and more evolved ( see paper i ) . in the model , the largest period spacing ( for @xmath7 ) is equal to @xmath82 d , almost a factor 3 smaller than observed in @xmath8 eri .",
    "whether this disagreement can be alleviated with a model which better matches the star remains to be verified .",
    "if this turns out to be unsuccessful , one can still invoke the unlikely idea that an unknown amplitude limitation mechanism is suppressing the modes halfway between the observed ones .",
    "the possibility that instead of an equally - spaced period triplet , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , we have a rotationally - split frequency triplet , @xmath55 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , is much less likely . indeed , for an @xmath7 @xmath5-mode with frequency equal to 0.7 d@xmath1 in the spb - star model of @xcite , the observed mean separation of the frequency triplet , equal to @xmath85 d@xmath1 , leads to equatorial velocity of rotation , @xmath86 , of about 30 kms@xmath1 ( see their fig .  13 ) , whereas available estimates of @xmath87 of @xmath8 eri range from 150 to 190 kms@xmath1 ( see paper i ) .",
    "increasing the model s radius in order to better match @xmath8 eri may increase @xmath86 to about 60 kms@xmath1 , still much less than the observed values . an additional problem is posed by the large asymmetry of the frequency triplet .",
    "the asymmetry is equal to @xmath88 d@xmath1 , while the rotational splitting seen in fig .",
    "13 of @xcite is nearly symmetric .",
    "in addition to confirming the spb classification of paper i , we have found @xmath8 eri to be an eclipsing variable . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig_3 ] and [ fig_5 ] , the eclipse is a transit , probably total , the secondary is fainter than the primary by several magnitudes , and the system is widely detached .",
    "as far as we are aware , the only other eclipsing variable with similar properties is 16 ( en ) lac @xcite , except that in the latter case the eclipse is partial .",
    "( interestingly , the discovery of an eclipse of this well - known @xmath6 cephei variable was a by - product a three - site campaign undertaken for observing the star s pulsations . ) solving the @xmath8 eri system will yield the primary s mean density and its surface gravity .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .      the frequencies @xmath90 and @xmath91 d@xmath1 ( see tables 2 and 6 ) and the mk type of a2v ( see the introduction ) leave no doubt that the star is a @xmath10 scuti variable . the strmgren indices , @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite , are not reddened .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the star s hipparcos parallax of @xmath94 mas . using the parallax and the @xmath95 magnitude from @xcite one",
    "gets @xmath96 , a value which , together with the @xmath97 index , places the star about 0.02 mag to the blue of the observational blue edge of the @xmath10 scuti instability strip in the @xmath98 vs.  @xmath97 diagram ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apart from indicating the need for a slight revision of the blue edge , this position in the diagram suggests marginal pulsation driving as a possible explanation for the small @xmath19 amplitudes .",
    "however , in view of the star s",
    "high @xmath99 of 165 kms@xmath1 @xcite , another explanation may be provided by the hypothesis of @xcite that fast rotation is a factor in limiting pulsation amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , with only two small - amplitude modes the asteroseismic potential of @xmath9 eri is insignificant .",
