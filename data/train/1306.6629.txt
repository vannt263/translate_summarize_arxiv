    "the quantum behavior of de sitter ( ds ) space is deeply mysterious @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of anti de sitter ( ads ) space , which via the ads / cft correspondence is the best understood example of quantum gravity . not surprisingly , many authors have tried to use ads / cft ideas in ds space .",
    "one such proposal is the ds / cft correspondence of strominger @xcite .",
    "closely related work was done by witten @xcite . in maldacena",
    "s interpretation of this proposal @xcite , the partition function of the cft  regarded as a function of sources  defines the wheeler - de witt ( wdw ) wave function as a function of bulk fields at future infinity .",
    "this will be the interpretation of interest in this paper .    until recently",
    ", nothing was known about the cft side of this duality , except for the properties determined from perturbative gravity calculations in the bulk .",
    "an important step forward was taken by anninos , hartman , and strominger , who formulated a precise proposal for the three - dimensional cft dual to vasiliev higher spin gravity in ds@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it had been previously proposed that even - spin and all - spin vasiliev gravities in ads@xmath0 correspond to the cfts of @xmath1 free scalar fields projected to the @xmath5 or @xmath6 singlet sector , respectively @xcite ; now , for the corresponding vasiliev theories in ds@xmath0 , the cfts are proposed to be theories of @xmath1 free grassmann fields projected to the @xmath7 or @xmath6 singlet sectors , respectively .",
    "similarly , critical ( wilson - fisher ) versions of these cfts have been conjectured to be dual to vasiliev gravities with a different choice of boundary conditions .    in a further development , anninos , denef , and harlow",
    "have computed the wdw wave function in the even - spin vasiliev theory as a function of the uniform background bulk scalar field by computing the partition function of the grassmann field theory as a function of the mass term @xcite .",
    "this allows one to make interesting statements / predictions about the vasiliev ds theories using the above ds / cft duality .",
    "@xcite found that while zero mass is a local maximum of probability ( i.e.  of the square of the wave function ) , there are other even higher maxima of probability at finite values of the scalar field background .",
    "these other maxima seem to correspond to nonperturbative instabilities around the perturbative ds space solution .",
    "similar results were found in @xcite for the wave function of pure three dimensional ds gravity , regarded as a function of the conformal structure at future infinity .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of vasiliev gravity in ds@xmath0 by looking at the ds / cft proposal from a different angle . in section [ vasilievsec ]",
    ", we propose to study the wdw wave function when the future boundary has more complicated topology .",
    "the requirement that the boundary theory is in the singlet sector plays a crucial role here .",
    "this is because the only known way to project onto a singlet sector using a local , explicit lagrangian formulation involves the weak coupling of vector matter to a chern - simons ( cs ) theory .",
    "cs is a topological theory which develops additional states on spatial manifolds with a nontrivial fundamental group .",
    "we find evidence that these states lead to another instability  one toward complicated boundary topology .",
    "in particular , the wdw amplitude of finding a boundary with the topology of a genus-@xmath8 riemann surface times a circle is found to be proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 is the ( large ) level of the associated cs theory and @xmath1 scales as @xmath11 , the inverse of the bulk newton s constant .",
    "thus , the wave function grows with the genus as @xmath12 $ ] , revealing an @xmath13 instability effect in the bulk . in section [ removalsec ]",
    "we explore various mechanisms which might eliminate this exponential growth with genus , but we do not find a satisfying one .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this exponential growth with genus is a generic feature of the quantum theory of de sitter space , or a special feature of vasiliev theory . to address this , we begin in section [ nonunitaritysec ] with a general discussion of features of euclidean conformal field theories holographically dual to ds via a ds / cft duality .",
    "we obtain consistency conditions which encode the condition that the local physics in the bulk is that of gravity and matter satisfying the usual ( bulk ) unitarity conditions .",
    "we argue that the partition function of a good ds / cft dual will deviate from that of a unitary cft only in a very particular way , while sharing certain exact properties with unitary partition functions in other respects .",
    "these requirements set even more stringent constraints on possible ways to remove large - genus divergences , and thereby they provide more justification for taking the large - genus effect seriously .",
    "we then discuss more general properties of the wdw wave function as a function of genus . in section [ einsteinsec ]",
    "we consider the case of einstein gravity with a positive cosmological constant . in einstein gravity",
    "there are field configurations that naturally interpolate between different topologies ( i.e.  cobordisms ) , and so it is natural to study the probability as a function of topology .",
    "we determine the wdw wave function in a semi - classical limit by computing the regularized action of complex solutions to the equations of motion ( instantons ) .",
    "the genus dependence of the wave function depends in detail on precisely which solutions contribute . in principle",
    ", one can determine which solutions contribute by defining an appropriate contour through field space .",
    "in practice , one does not know how to define this contour and some sort of _ ad hoc _ prescription must be used .",
    "we consider two natural prescriptions .",
    "the first is simply to include all saddles .",
    "this leads to a probability that increases exponentially with topology , as in vasiliev gravity , but with a different strength .",
    "the probability of a genus-@xmath8 riemann surface times a circle is found to be proportional to @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the other prescription we consider is to include only those saddles which arise in the analytic continuation from euclidean ads .",
    "this leads to a probability which vanishes exponentially with genus , in tension with the vasiliev result .",
    "moreover , the contour leads to certain other features which seem to conflict with the ones considered in section [ nonunitaritysec ] .",
    "we take this as evidence against the contour defined by analytic continuation from euclidean ads , and as an indication that the genus divergence occurs even in einstein gravity .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of open issues in section [ discussionsec ] .",
    "in this section we study future topology in asymptotically ds@xmath0 universes in vasiliev gravity @xcite .",
    "vasiliev gravity is a remarkable classical gauge theory that contains fields of arbitrarily high spin ; in this sense it resembles a tension - free limit of a string theory .",
    "however , its lagrangian formulation and quantization rules are currently unknown , and hence we can not explicitly compute the wdw wave function in this theory . at present , the only reasonable way to understand quantum ( or at least semiclassical ) vasiliev ds is through the holographic prescriptions of strominger and maldacena .",
    "this is the tool we will exclusively use below .",
    "the issues we wish to highlight can be illustrated already in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , which posits a duality between 4d vasiliev gravity in ads and the singlet sector of the 3d @xmath5 or @xmath6 vector model at a critical point @xcite .",
    "such a boundary theory is typically given a local , lagrangian formulation by weakly coupling the critical matter ( taken to be scalar here ) to a chern - simons ( cs ) topological field theory .",
    "the resulting action is where @xmath10 is the cs level , @xmath15 is the gauge field one - form , @xmath16 is the gauge - covariant derivative , @xmath17 is a scalar field that transforms as an @xmath1-component vector with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is chosen so that the theory is conformal .",
    "( different choices of this potential correspond to choosing the theory to be a marginal @xmath20 theory or to be at the wilson - fisher fixed point  the critical theory . ) on spacetimes of topology @xmath21 the duality between this singlet theory and the vasiliev bulk appears to work due to the following desirable features :    1 .",
    "the cs term introduces no additional gluon states , and yet ( in the weak coupling / infinite level limit ) it enforces gauss law that projects the matter spectrum onto just the singlets .",
    "since the `` pure glue '' sector has only one state on this topology , the spectrum consists of only singlet states of matter fields , and these precisely match up with bulk vasiliev fields , as described in the original proposal by klebanov and polyakov @xcite .",
    "cs - matter theories possess families of fixed points ( indexed by the t hooft coupling @xmath22 and distinguished by different matter potentials @xmath23 ) that map onto the known families of vasiliev theories @xcite .",
    "the boundary correlation functions precisely match the ads / cft correlators from vasiliev gravity when the boundary is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of higher spin symmetries in the theory @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the two dualities above to other topologies are still far from fully understood .",
    "for instance , a puzzle is raised by the observation that a cs - matter system on @xmath25 contains additional light states stemming from nontrivial holonomies along the cycles of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these light states do not have known duals in vasiliev theory .",
    "they are closely related to the light states found in 2d cft duals of higher spin gravity in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the light states are small deformations of the zero energy states in the pure cs theory . roughly speaking ,",
    "the coupling between the cs sector and the matter sector is @xmath28 and so at large @xmath10 the cs states continue to be light and their entropy remains unaffected .",
    "this was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "on @xmath29 at large @xmath10 the states of the pure cs theory can be understood from the semiclassical quantization of the classical phase space of the cs theory , which is the ( @xmath30-dimensional ) space of flat connections on @xmath26 @xcite . in the wilson - fisher fixed point theory ( i.e.  the critical theory )",
    "the scalar sector is gapped and can be integrated out to give an effective potential for the flat connections , giving small gaps for the cs states which vanish when @xmath31 .",
    "the decoupling of the matter is manifest . at temperatures @xmath32 of order one",
    ", all the cs states will be counted in the entropy of the cs - matter theory . except when otherwise noted , we will henceforward take @xmath32 ( determined by the size of the @xmath33 ) to be in this range . (",
    "the case of the free scalar theory is more subtle because of the scalar zero mode .",
    "nonetheless , as argued in @xcite , a similar picture holds . )",
    "the partition function is the scaling of this result follows from the dimension of the phase space and the role of @xmath10 as @xmath34 in the semiclassical quantization .",
    "these observations carry over to cs - matter theories on more complicated topology @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on @xmath35 . here",
    "we need to take the critical theory to avoid the instability due to the @xmath36 term in the action with @xmath37 negative .",
    "term , but at a value of @xmath17 that grows with @xmath10 . ] the value of the pure cs partition function is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the scaling can be determined by the dimension of the phase space .",
    "there are @xmath38 holonomies , one fundamental group constraint on the product of the holonomies , and one overall @xmath39 rotation to eliminate .",
    "this leaves a @xmath40 dimensional classical phase space .",
    "( the matter phase space is only order @xmath1 dimensional and so is negligible . )",
    "quantizing semiclassically gives    the partition function for higher genus surfaces diverges exponentially fast in the genus with a rate that increases with @xmath10 and @xmath1 , both large in the ",
    "t hooft limit appropriate for weakly coupled gravity . for t hooft coupling @xmath41 , but for simplicity we will continue talking about @xmath42 scaling . ] note that the @xmath43 in the above exponent is formally of order @xmath13 , not the more conventional @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the vasiliev theory should really be interpreted as the open string sector of an open - closed string theory where the @xmath43 degrees of freedom are part of the closed string sector @xcite .    on the other hand , if the cft is put on @xmath44 , the partition function",
    "_ decreases _ as @xcite this was the first indication of the @xmath43 dependence in the cs - matter theory . on a lens space",
    "@xmath45 the decay is slower @xcite , the regime in which the @xmath44 is so thinly `` squashed '' by the @xmath46 orbifolding of the hopf fiber @xmath33 that it becomes similar to @xmath47 from the point of view of the cs theory .",
    "these decreasing magnitudes can not be seen through direct canonical quantization , and hence they can not be associated with any `` state counting '' or `` negative entropy '' reasoning .",
    "the upshot of these calculations is that cs and cs - matter theories on three - spheres and lens spaces come with an inherently negative and large contribution to the free energy stemming from the gauge sector .",
    "] ,    the rapid increases of the partition function for large genus persist in the vasiliev context , to which we now turn . as mentioned in the introduction , vasiliev gravity in ds can be studied through the non - trivial modification of the @xmath5 version of this correspondence : when @xmath1 is even , the even - spin vasiliev gravity in ds space appears to be dual to the @xmath48 vector model at a fixed point @xcite . ''",
    "is a convenient shorthand for `` @xmath7 with all young tableaux transposed . ''",
    "this shorthand is used because some results obtained from the @xmath48 singlet vector model are obtained from those in the @xmath5 model by letting @xmath49 .",
    "however , not all calculable quantities of the two models are related in this way .",
    "for instance , the @xmath7 group is non - compact while @xmath5 is compact , so their volumes can not be related by just a change of sign of @xmath1 .",
    "thus it might not be advisable to think of @xmath48 as a kind of analytic continuation from @xmath5 .",
    "+ the @xmath48 statement of ds / cft has been checked at the level of matching bulk and boundary correlators .",
    "it is of note that other gauge groups on the boundary could possibly lead to the same correlator matches ; for instance , something like @xmath50 might provide a compact alternative to @xmath7 that leads to equally acceptable correlators .",
    "+ there exists a corresponding , as yet unchecked statement about the duality between the @xmath51 model and the all - spin vasiliev gravity in ds , where `` @xmath51 '' stands for `` @xmath6 with all young tableaux transposed . ''",
    "the matter lagrangian in this case would be @xmath52 .",
    "there are no compactness issues in this case . ]",
    "this cs - matter theory is given by the action where @xmath53 is the canonical symplectic form , @xmath54 is a vector of @xmath1 anticommuting scalars ( grassman fields ) , and @xmath55 .",
    "it is assumed that , for a suitable choice of @xmath56 , this theory can be conformal in the large @xmath1 limit  just like its @xmath5 counterpart .    under the proposed ds / cft duality , the time direction in vasiliev ds is holographically reconstructed , and the above cft lives on the future infinity of the bulk .",
    "moreover , the partition function of the boundary cft is interpreted as a wdw wave function obtained in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "thus the @xmath48 model cft emerges as a potent tool for calculating probability amplitudes on the space of late - time fields in quantum vasiliev gravity : one merely has to compute the modulus squared of the cft partition function to find a proxy for the probability distribution on the space of manifolds at the future infinity of vasiliev ds .",
    "the large @xmath1 asymptotics ( presented in this paper ) give corresponding wdw amplitudes in the semiclassical approximation of vasiliev gravity .",
    "the same asymptotics for the partition function discussed above for the cs - commuting scalar theory are present in the @xmath51 anticommuting scalar model cft : @xmath57 .",
    "the dual of this cft is conjectured to be vasiliev all - spin gravity in ds space .",
    "these asymptotics follow because the @xmath51 model has the same gauge group as the @xmath6 one , and , as in the commuting case , the matter does not disturb the count of pure cs theory states at large @xmath10 and finite @xmath58 .",
    "the anticommuting nature of the fields means that a negative eigenvalue of the quadratic form in the action is not dangerous , and so either the free or critical theories are acceptable .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath48 cft has never been worked out in detail , but behavior similar to that above must appear due to the existence of @xmath59 states found through semiclassical quantization on @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath48 theory , if constructed as an @xmath7 singlet vector model , features an additional divergence due to the non - compactness of its gauge group .",
    "this is a curious and new issue , particularly because this divergence is associated to the even - spin vasiliev theory but _ not _ to the all - spin vasiliev theory , and it can presumably be cured by focusing on a related compact group , say @xmath50 .",
    "to avoid conceptual difficulties related to the non - compactness of @xmath7 , one may wish to think in terms of the @xmath51 vector model for the rest of this section .",
    "the rapid growth associated to higher - topology future infinities is intriguing because , as mentioned above , newton s constant in the bulk scales as @xmath61 ; a growth exponential in @xmath43 signifies a @xmath13 effect in the bulk .",
    "this does not correspond to any known object in a gravity theory .",
    "it is currently unknown how one should approach these divergences or decays of the probability amplitude , and the attempt to understand these effects from direct computations in bulk vasiliev gravity is beyond our scope .    in section [ removalsec ]",
    "we will discuss several different paths one could take in the hope of understanding these issues by studying the boundary theory directly . before doing so",
    ", we will turn to a few details of the higher spin ds / cft construction which might effect our discussion .",
    "the authors of @xcite have raised several interesting issues about the persistence of the boundary field theory fixed points after continuing to the ds regime .",
    "in particular , the fixed points found at finite @xmath62 in @xcite might in principle cease to exist when @xmath49 . on general grounds we expect the effect of matter to be a @xmath63 effect , and",
    "so do not expect the change @xmath64 to affect the leading large @xmath1  classical \" fixed point .",
    "the @xmath63 corrections are more subtle because of the existence of the almost marginal @xmath20 operator .",
    "nonetheless , we do not see a reason for the zero of the beta function to disappear .",
    "this issue is more easily analyzed in another realization of vectorlike ds / cft .",
    "if we continue the free fermion realization of vectorlike ads / cft to ds we find the dual is a theory of commuting @xmath5 spin - half fields .",
    "here there is no almost marginal operator and hence it is manifest that the cft fixed point persists at finite @xmath10 .",
    "the cs coupling is discretized and so it does not run .",
    "we hope to return to this issue in the near future @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have also raised the possibility that the appropriate continuation to the ds regime may require @xmath65 to ensure the proper reality conditions for the parity violating terms in the bulk vasiliev theory .",
    "we have examined a truncation of the full theory to spin-0 and spin-1 fields and do not find a need for this complexification .",
    "nevertheless , a more complete analysis is called for .",
    "if ( for some reason ) imaginary @xmath10 is required , a whole host of problems would develop .",
    "the cs level would no longer be quantized and so it may run under rg .",
    "monopole operators have @xmath66 and so under naive continuation have large imaginary @xmath67 .",
    "this minimizes the classical instability due to highly irrelevant operators that will be pointed out in section 4 , but may make the @xmath63 expansion , the standard @xmath68 expansion of quantum gravity , badly behaved . in particular , consider the theory on @xmath47 .",
    "there are corrections to perturbation theory due to monopole `` states '' going around the @xmath33 of order @xmath69 where the radius of the @xmath33 is order one . in ads",
    "/ cft these are of order @xmath70 and hence nonperturbatively small .",
    "but if @xmath10 ( and hence @xmath62 ) are imaginary , then navely these effects are of order @xmath71 and are of order one magnitude .",
    "the @xmath63 series is no longer asymptotic .",
    "presumably a stokes line has been crossed .",
    "so far we have worked on manifolds @xmath35 , with the size of @xmath33 taken to be of order one .",
    "cs - matter systems of the type considered in this paper possess high - temperature phases in which the contribution of matter to the free energy ( of order @xmath72 ) becomes comparable to the contribution of the cs sector , which is of order @xmath73 @xcite . by choosing to normalize the volume of the spatial manifold to @xmath74",
    ", we find that the phase transition happens at temperatures @xmath75 .",
    "the partition function scalings that we have presented in the preceding are no longer valid in this case",
    ". it may be possible that the genus - dependent divergences are no longer present .",
    "we will qualitatively analyze this situation and find that the genus enhancement is present at high temperatures  moreover , no phase transition is found . after integrating out matter , the partition function of the @xmath51 model can be written as a matrix model .",
    "let @xmath76 be the eigenvalues of this matrix",
    ". the partition function will be of the schematic form ( omitting constant prefactors and intricacies from multiple holonomies ) : the first term in the potential for the @xmath77 s comes from the gauge sector , while the second term comes from the matter sector .",
    "the above integral can be analyzed by reducing it to a saddle point calculation at large @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge sector potential aims to clump the eigenvalues together , while the matter sector aims to have each eigenvalue attain @xmath78 . at @xmath75 ,",
    "these two criteria must be satisfied simultaneously , but this is possible , unlike in the case of @xmath6 or @xmath51 models on @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no phase transition in which the matter takes over the gauge sector s domination and qualitatively alters the behavior of eigenvalues .",
    "rather , at the saddle point all eigenvalues clump at @xmath78 . in this regime ,",
    "the partition function scales as and the large - genus divergence is still present .",
    "we have here given a very schematic derivation of the high-@xmath32 behavior of the partition function on @xmath35 ; it would be interesting to fill in the holes and develop a new matrix model that would correspond to the @xmath51 vector model at @xmath79 .",
    "this is yet another topic that is relegated to future work .",
    "let us recap the analysis so far . we have seen that , in the higher spin ds / cft proposal of @xcite , the probability that future infinity has topology @xmath35 diverges with genus as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "the conservative and least speculative way to address this issue is to accept the ds / cft dictionary but restrict the topology at future infinity .",
    "for example , as stated above , ds / cft does not run into trouble on topologies of the form @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore possible to ask meaningful questions about which boundary geometry is picked out by the wdw wave function from the set of all topologically @xmath21 manifolds .",
    "we may think of this restriction as a future boundary condition on the space of all possible ds universes .",
    "this avenue of research has led to interesting open questions concerning instabilities and remains relevant regardless of any topological considerations @xcite .",
    "other topologies are amenable to the same treatment : one may compare the wdw amplitudes for different geometries that have the same topology .",
    "for instance , one might ask whether a vasiliev spacetime prefers to break spherical symmetry at future infinity while still retaining the topology of an @xmath44 . even if the ds / cft prescription leads to diverging prefactors in path integrals",
    ", these would all cancel in the calculation of relevant relative probabilities",
    ".    however , it is easy to construct solutions to the classical equations of motion which asymptote to topologies of the form @xmath35 at future infinity .",
    "these are quotients of ds@xmath0 by a discrete subgroup of its isometry group . as",
    "this solution is locally de sitter , it clearly solves the vasiliev equations of motion .",
    "these solutions have singularities of milne type in the far past , where presumably quantum corrections are needed to fully understand the geometry .",
    "the existence of these solutions is certainly a necessary , though not sufficient , condition that the wdw wave function is supported on non - trivial topology .",
    "it is likely that other , more complicated , solutions to the equations of motion exist with the same asymptotics . in the absence of an argument to the contrary",
    ", it seems unphysical  and acausal  to impose a restriction on the possible state of the universe in the far future .",
    "we will therefore take all ds / cft results at face value .",
    "this means that high - genus surfaces at future infinity are preferred , and the wave function of vasiliev de sitter space is asymptotic form is an infinite - genus , `` future foam''-like structure .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will discuss whether this large genus divergence can be removed by some modification of the higher spin ds / cft conjecture .",
    "in quantum field theory , we are used to the idea of using `` renormalization '' to remove infinite factors in the partition function .",
    "it is natural to speculate that the large @xmath10 , large @xmath1 , and large - genus divergences could be removed by something like a standard renormalization procedure .",
    "however , not all divergences are created equal , and in this section we argue that the divergences of ds / cft can not be renormalized by any reasonable renormalization procedure .      according to the usual quantum field - theoretic idea of renormalization , we are allowed to modify the action of a field theory by arbitrary local counterterms .",
    "one might attempt to remove the @xmath42 divergence of the partition function by adding a @xmath10-dependent local term to the action .",
    "however , it is simple to check that there is no local term consistent with scale invariance that would accomplish this .",
    "the pure cs action has no local operators of its own , which leaves only @xmath82-number terms built from the background metric .",
    "however , the only scale - invariant term which can be built from the background metric and its curvatures in three dimensions is the gravitational chern - simons term , which vanishes for geometries of @xmath35 topology .",
    "terms involving the matter fields are already fixed by conformal invariance ; there are no available counterterms in the matter sector .",
    "therefore , there is no way to cancel the large @xmath10 divergence with operators constructed from the gauge connection and background metric .",
    "we now explore more extreme modifications of the theory in order to remove the @xmath42 divergence .",
    "we first might imagine adding additional spectator degrees of freedom that are decoupled from the cs - matter system .",
    "we take these degrees of freedom to be local to retain some degree of predictivity and control .",
    "this decoupled system could conceivably be chosen to have the effect of cancelling the large @xmath10 behavior .",
    "the new degrees of freedom must form a topological field theory in order to preserve the spectrum of the boundary theory on simple topologies . hence",
    ", the only viable possibility is another cs theory .",
    "let us study the @xmath51 version of ds / cft",
    ". it would be simplest if the large genus behavior could be removed by inserting a decoupled @xmath6 cs sector into the boundary theory .",
    "however , this would clearly just exacerbate the divergences . to cancel the divergent prefactors of the form @xmath83",
    ", we would need to replace @xmath10 by @xmath28 or to replace @xmath1 by @xmath84 in the counter - theory .",
    "neither option , on its own , leads to a well - defined cs gauge theory : the cs level must be an integer to preserve invariance under large gauge transformations , and @xmath1 must be a real integer in order for the @xmath6 algebra to close .",
    "nevertheless , one may _ define _ the desired theories through analytic continuation of well - defined cs theories @xcite .",
    "we conclude that one way to define a divergence - free boundary theory is to start with two cs gauge fields with the same level and gauge group , with only one of them coupled to matter , and then analytically continue the decoupled gauge sector to either @xmath28 or @xmath84 .",
    "while this technically works , it can not be implemented by a local lagrangian because the state degeneracies , the coefficients of exponentials in along a thermal or timelike circle , can not be integers .",
    "even the weaker condition , that they have a hamiltonian implementing translations along the circle direction , can not hold . in the absence of a local definition",
    "this procedure is _ ad hoc _ and unpredictive .",
    "one can take a different route and simply multiply the partition function by an overall coefficient . for a positive integer coefficient",
    ", there is a manifestly local way to do this : simply add a massive scalar field with multiple vacua at zero energy , and take the mass to infinity .",
    "however , if we are interested in decreasing the value of the partition function rather than increasing it , then we can not do so with any sort of local or causal dynamics .    a prescription to multiply the partition function by an overall numerical coefficient is actually a special case of a set of spectator fields with arbitrarily nonlocal interactions . to see this ,",

    "@xmath148 , the eigenvalues of time translation along the @xmath149 are no longer determined directly by representation theory as they are for the round @xmath144 , but we can nonetheless rule out the possibility of unbounded - energy nonunitarity by considering the behavior of solutions to the wave equation . for particle states in the bulk with wavelengths @xmath28 much smaller than @xmath150 , the global geometry and topology of @xmath147",

    "we would of course like to learn about the unitarity properties of ds / cft beyond the limit where bulk physics of einstein gravity coupled to local fields is the controlling approximation .",
    "we observe here that ds / cft displays only a very limited type of nonunitarity  complex - energy nonunitarity but not unbounded - energy or spectral - density nonunitarities  not only in the einstein - gravity limit but in the vasiliev theory as well , which is in a drastically different range of anomalous dimensions for the cft .",
    "the vasiliev theory ( assuming the correctness of the higher spin ds / cft duality ) appears to have the properties of positive spectral density and energy bounded below even at finite @xmath1 , indicating that these are features of the full quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , in the event that one considers families of ds / cft theories that interpolate continuously between large and small coupling in the cft ( as defined , say , by the sizes of anomalous dimensions ) , an infinitesimal variation of the parameter must be realized as an operator insertion in the cft .",
    "such an insertion can only alter the hamiltonian of the cft , but can not continuously change the norm of a state from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",

    "the central observation is that any euclidean solution of einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant will , upon setting @xmath203 , give a ( possibly complex ) solution to the equations of motion with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "this is because the euclidean ads action @xmath204 and the lorentzian ds action @xmath193 are related by the analytic continuation @xmath205 .",
    "if the original solution has a euclidean ads boundary at @xmath206 , then the analytically continued solution will have a lorentzian ds boundary at @xmath207 . in euclidean ads",
    "there is a natural choice of saddles to include in the path integral : those which describe real , smooth metrics in asymptotically ads space .",
    "the remarkable observation of @xcite is that , at the level of perturbation theory around global ads ( ds ) space , these solutions analytically continue to those which define the hartle - hawking ( i.e. bunch - davies ) state in de sitter space .",
    "although the observation of @xcite was only made at the level of perturbation theory , it is natural to conjecture that it defines an appropriate contour even at the non - perturbative level . then the wave function can be computed as follows .",
    "each smooth , real asymptotically ads geometry gives a contribution to the euclidean ads gravity partition function of the form @xmath208 .",
    "the wdw wave function in ds gravity is then computed by taking @xmath209 , so that @xmath210 where @xmath204 is the action of euclidean ads gravity .",
    "the result is summed over all smooth , real solutions of ads gravity .",
    "it is important to note that , although each such solutions can be interpreted as complex solutions of ds gravity , not all complex solutions of lorentzian ds gravity will appear in the sum ; some of the lorentzian solutions give geometries which are singular in euclidean ads .",
    "this prescription selects a set of preferred saddles in lorentzian ds .    in the present case ,",
    "it is easy to understand which of the saddles constructed in section 5.1 will contribute to the wave function .",
    "they are those which correspond to smooth , euclidean ads black holes .",
    "the time coordinate of the ds solutions continues to the ads radial coordinate via @xmath211 .",
    "the smooth euclidean black hole is given by the geometry where the radial coordinate pinches off at the value .",
    "when @xmath212 there is in addition a `` small black hole '' saddle where it caps off at @xmath213 .",
    "] this should be compared to the lorentzian solutions of equation ( [ tau0 ] ) , where various additional signs are allowed .",
    "we see that only one particular lorentzian solution continues to the euclidean ads black hole ; the others continue to singular geometries where the euclidean horizon does not pinch off smoothly .",
    "the regularized euclidean action can now be computed , giving ( writing @xmath214 ) the wave function is @xmath215 .",
    "we will focus on the limit @xmath216 , where    this result has two important qualitative features .",
    "first , the wave function vanishes in the large genus limit for fixed @xmath135 .",
    "second , for fixed @xmath8 the wave function vanishes as @xmath197 .",
    "both of these results are the exact opposite of the behaviour found in vasiliev theory .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is that vasiliev gravity is profoundly different from einstein gravity .",
    "a second interpretation is that , despite its elegance , the euclidean ads contour prescription considered in this section is incorrect . in particular ,",
    "a wave function which vanishes as @xmath217 seems difficult to realize in a theory which exhibits only complex - energy nonunitarity .",
    "this is easiest to see in the boundary cft , where the wave function with @xmath157 asymptotics equals the finite temperature partition function @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the generator of euclidean translations along the circle .",
    "even though the boundary theory is nonunitary , this partition function still diverges at @xmath217 in the usual way .",
    "given this , it seems likely that the wdw wave function can not be computed simply by analytic continuation of classical instanton actions from euclidean ads .. this would signal a breakdown of the semi - classical expansion at high temperature .",
    "this is essentially what was found in @xcite , where the wave function diverged at @xmath197 in three dimensional gravity .",
    "this was due to a one - loop effect which dominated the naive classical result .",
    "we see no indication that a similar effect happens in the present case , but it would be interesting to investigate this further . ]",
    "we have found evidence for an instability toward more complicated topology in vasiliev ds / cft and have not found a satisfying way of eliminating it .",
    "einstein calculations indicate a similar trend , albeit with a different strength .",
    "the current understanding of the ads / cft duality in the vasiliev context strongly indicates that the higher spin gravitational fields form an open sector with coupling @xmath63 interacting with a topological closed string sector with coupling @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "the chern - simons sector in the cft corresponds to this closed string sector .",
    "a full understanding of the behavior of the ds theory on higher topologies will require an understanding of the ds version of the closed string sector .",
    "in analyzing the meaning of the divergence and possible ways to evade it , we have found it helpful to distinguish various respects in which the partition function of a conformal field theory could in principle deviate from the restricted form satisfied by a unitary cft .",
    "it is notable that the cs - matter theory and the cft dual of the einstein - gravity limit display an extremely constrained and non - generic type of nonunitarity in their partition functions , despite the fact that the two cft live in very different regimes of their coupling constants and anomalous dimensions . on this basis",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the positive integrality of the spectral density and the boundedness - below of the real parts of the energies may be exact properties satisfied by all conformal field theories that realize any kind of quantum - gravitational theory of de sitter space holographically , whether it is closely approximated by einstein gravity or not .",
    "we emphasize that the einstein gravity computation relies on a crucial assumption , which is that the complex metrics described above lie on an appropriate contour of integration through the space of metrics . without a better understanding of the path integral of quantum gravity it is difficult to say whether this is the case .",
    "one possible implication is that quantum gravity in de sitter space is intrinsically unstable ; this is consistent with other observations about de sitter gravity @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that de sitter gravity only makes sense only if we impose a future boundary condition on the wdw wave function , including one which restricts the topology of the spatial slice .",
    "yet another possibility is that the divergence need not be interpreted at all , because it describes only probabilities for quantities inaccessible to any given observer .",
    "the spatial topology of the universe at future infinity can not be deduced from inside the causal horizon of any single timelike worldline , and therefore defines not an `` observable '' but a `` meta - observable . ''",
    "such meta - observables are the basic quantities calculated by the ds / cft framework , or for that matter any theory of the wdw wave function .",
    "however it is well known that quantum mechanics generally does not predict sensible probabilities for physical quantities that are inaccessible to any observer due to the presence of a horizon .",
    "it may be that only suitably coarse - grained probabilities , averaged over all quantities outside a single observer s causal region , will produce an internally consistent set of relative probabilities .",
    "this would require one to incorporate a new rule into the ds / cft framework that implements observer complementarity as a selection principle for finite quantities .",
    "it is not clear at present how to do so .",
