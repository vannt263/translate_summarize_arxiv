    "ionized outflowing gas ( or ` warm absorber ' , wa ) is believed to be common in the inner parts of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) based on x - ray spectroscopy . about 50% of seyfert 1s @xcite and quasars @xcite",
    "are characterized by blue - shifted x - ray absorption lines , the velocities of which are usually several hundred @xmath7 .",
    "uv narrow absorption lines from outflowing gas were also detected at a similar fraction @xcite , and showed velocities and ionization states as similar to was in some cases @xcite .",
    "however , in other cases there is no clear physical correspondence between them @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown that was can be well modeled by including multiple absorbing components , which appear to be in pressure equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the structure of was can be interpreted as a multi - phase medium , and most likely occupies the same spatial region @xcite .",
    "another suggestion that was occur in continuous density - stratified streamers @xcite seems to be ruled out @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , very little is still known about the physical states of was , or their dynamics and geometry .",
    "the most fundamental question is where was originate .",
    "proposed locations span a wide range in radial distance from the central ionizing source : the accretion disk @xcite , the broad line region ( blr ) @xcite , the putative obscuring torus @xcite and the narrow line region @xcite .",
    "simulations have offered similar possibilities , such as the accretion disk wind @xcite , the wind from torus @xcite , the large - scale outflows @xcite , but ruled out few options .    in principle , these outflows could potentially provide a common form of agn feedback .",
    "but whether the outflow winds could extend into the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium @xcite or just fall back into the accretion disk @xcite , depends critically on the exact location of was when estimating the mass outflow rate and the total outflow kinetic energy .",
    "one key diagnostic for the location of was is based on applying non - equilibrium models on time variable agns @xcite .",
    "such strong variability needed to apply to this method is not that common .",

    "flux calibration of each observation was carried out using the calibration database ( version 4.1.2 ) .",
    "the + 1st and -1st orders of each heg and meg spectra were combined ; higher orders were ignored .",

    "rgs data were processed with the task rgsproc according to the standard method proposed in the sas thread .",
    "we used the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis version 1.5.0 , @xcite ) to fit the spectra .",
    "when fitting the data , we used the @xmath18 statistic @xcite to find the best - fitting model parameters in the high - resolution spectra .",
    "the mrk 290 spectrum is affected by a relatively low galactic absorption : @xmath19 @xcite , which is included in all models .",
    "the spectra were binned to 0.01  , and fitted in the wavelength range 1.5 - 25  , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : none1 ] .",
    "in contrast to previous results , where mrk 290 was described by an absorbed power law @xcite , we found that a black - body component was needed in addition to the absorbed power law in order to fit the continuum .",
    "the black - body component was included to account for the soft excess , that could come from a standard optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "the intrinsic cold absorption was negligible compared to the galactic column density . in fact , half of agn @xcite and quasars @xcite do not appear to have significant intrinsic cold gas absorption .",
    "the _ pn _ spectrum was grouped to give a minimum of 50 counts per bin in order to apply @xmath20 statistics . the same model as fitted to hetgs spectra but with free parameters provided a good fit to the _ pn _ data , except for two prominent residuals around 0.8 and 6.3 kev .",

    "they are red - shifted at offset velocities of @xmath26 with respect to the systemic redshift , which is definitely different from the absorption lines .",
    "the velocities do not change over three years suggests that these emission lines may be emitted in the same gas .",
    "the fit results for the three lines are shown in table  [ tab : emit ] .",

    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of @xmath27 ev for the high - state spectrum and of @xmath28 ev for the low - state spectrum are consistent with the result of @xcite .",

    "the cash statistics changed by 2 and 8 when reducing one @xmath29 for the high- and low - state spectra , respectively , and the equivalent widths ( ews ) increased to @xmath30 ev and @xmath31 ev . the fwhm of @xmath21 in the high - state spectrum is @xmath32 , and in the low - state _ pn _ spectrum is @xmath33 , which agrees with result @xcite .    in the high - state spectrum , a line at 1.897   seems consistent with the n=2 - 1 resonance transition of  ( at a rest energy of 6.696 kev ) .",

    ". however , this two features are probably spurious .",
    "the publicly available photoionization code xstar is the tool we used to model the physical conditions of the absorbing gas .",
    "it includes h- and he - like transitions of most ions , l - shell transitions of fe , and important m - shell transitions of fe that contribute to the uta feature .",
    "we used pvm_xstar @xcite to generate grids of models , which provides parallel execution of xstar 2.1ln11 .",
    "we adopted the default solar abundances @xcite in xstar , and used a velocity turbulence ( _ b_-value ) of @xmath35 , which corresponds approximately to the limiting meg spectral resolution ( @xmath36 fwhm at 0.5 kev ) @xcite .",
    "this choice is justified by the absence of detectable line broadening .",
    "the photoionization model used here contains three parameters : red - shift _ z _ ; total neutral hydrogen column density @xmath37 ; and the ionization parameter @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ionizing luminosity in the range 1 - 1000 ryd , @xmath40 is the electron density , and @xmath41 is the distance of the ionized gas from the central ionizing source .",
    "first of all , we constructed the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of mrk 290 to generate the photoionization models .",
    "however , the intrinsic x - ray spectrum , an important part of the sed , is obtained by fitting the x - ray data with photoionization models .",
    "thus a two - step iterative process is employed to set the intrinsic spectrum , as described in @xcite .    in the first step ,",
    "the ionizing x - ray spectrum is obtained by fitting the continuum without a wa to construct a sed .",
    "the sed is then used to generate a grid of warm absorption models that are fit to the spectra .",
    "the second step is similar to the first step : using the new intrinsic x - ray spectrum for a new sed , which is in turn used to generate new set of photoionization models .    the mid - state data ( i d 4399 ) was observed simultaneously in the uv band by .",
    "we adopted this uv data point @xcite , while other data were obtained from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) : radio data from vla , 25 @xmath42 data from iras , and r band data from sdss .    for each state , the flux point at 0.5 kev band on the intrinsic x - ray continuum",
    "was simply linked to the uv point and to other data in the sed by straight lines in log - log space , as shown in fig  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "we derived luminosities of 0.5 - 13.6 kev band from the intrinsic x - ray spectral models , measured luminosities of 13.6 ev - 0.5 kev band from the two point lines in seds , and added them to determine @xmath39 .",
    "detailed intrinsic continuum parameters and luminosities are listed in table  [ tab : warmabs ] .",
    "@xcite modeled the spectrum of mrk 290 with one wa component generated using xstar , obtaining an ionization parameter @xmath43 and a column density @xmath44 of @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , we began with one wa in fitting hetgs spectra .",
    "the spectra were binned to 0.01  , and fitted with one ionization component .",
    "the model represents most absorption lines well , and the best fit results are shown in table  [ tab : onewa ] .",
    "the absorber is blue - shifted by @xmath46 relative to the systemic redshift , and neither its column density nor ionization parameter changed apparently from mid - state to high - state during half a month . since the uta feature is quite clear in the rgs spectrum , one wa component fitting is not suitable for the low - state data .",
    "coarsely binned high- and mid - state spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twohigh ] , in which the green lines represent the best fitting model from table  [ tab : onewa ] .",
    "the visual inspection of the spectra reveals the unfitted uta feature clearly in the 16 - 17.5   band , suggesting that the single wa component is not sufficient to account for all absorbing features .",
    "the uta is a broad feature , and its shape is sensitive to the charge states of fe producing it , so we rebinned the spectra heavily .",
    "since the uta is a key diagnostic of material in a low - ionization state , a second wa with a lower ionization level is required to be included in the model .",
    "we modeled the high - state spectrum using a two phase wa with parameters set free , except the redshift of the higher ionization component was fixed to @xmath47 from table  [ tab : onewa ] .",

    "the outflow velocity is similar to that of the high ionization component , and the other best fit parameters are reported in table  [ tab : warmabs ] .    providing that no properties in table  [ tab : warmabs ] varied in 17 days and the dynamical timescale is much longer than the radiative recombination timescale , when fitting the mid - state spectrum , we fixed the redshift and column density of each absorbing component to that of high - state , but allowed the ionization parameter to vary . unfortunately , the large uncertainties in @xmath1 of the low ionization component can not constrain the possible response of opacity to the continuum variation .",
    "the two phase wa model was also used to fit the rgs spectrum , adding several gaussian lines to account for the local absorption lines and the  forbidden emission line .",
    "[ fig : rgsflux ] shows the best model for rgs spectrum , and fitting results are listed in table  [ tab : warmabs ] .",
    "as expected , the deep uta feature comes from the lower ionized material , while other features identified as transitions of , , ,  and , come from the higher ionization component .",
    "the  absorption lines are believed to be associated with the low ionization component @xcite , though the observed lines are much deeper than what the photoionization model predicts here .",
    "however , it could also be the result from carbon - rich gas .",
    "the  complex is not well fitted here , as in hetgs spectra ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twohigh ] ) , which is partly due to the uncertainties of di - electronic recombination rates for iron l - shell ions @xcite , and partly due to the uncertainty of the iron abundance ( solar abundance is used in the photoionization models ) . neither the ionization parameter nor the column density of the two wa components varied significantly compared to that found in the hetgs spectra , but the outflow velocity increased by a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "we have applied the two phase warm absorber model back to the 0.01   binned high - state spectrum again and checked residuals carefully .",
    "three important fe l - shell absorption lines were left unfitted ,  ( 12.284  ) ,  ( 11.770  ) ,  ( 10.981  ) . a hotter high ionization component is required to explain these absorption lines , as labeled in fig .",
