    "the occurrence of singularities in classical general relativity ( gr ) may be the symptom of the existence of a more general physical frame , where gr is embedded as a particular low curvature limit .",
    "in such a frame , that we will generically call `` new physics '' , one may expect that singularities are cured by the existence of a natural physical cutoff , i.e. a scale where the new physics comes into play , replacing gr . presently , the only consistent example of such a general theory is string theory , or its 11-dimensional generalization m - theory , where this cutoff is naturally provided by the string length @xmath0 .    following this reasoning line , in a cosmological context ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the new physics would prevent the big bang singularity predicted by gr , allowing a continuation of the cosmological solutions before the big bang .",
    "this idea , firstly proposed by veneziano and gasperini @xcite , has found several alternative implementations and recurrently emerges in independent attempts to build consistent cosmological models from string - m / theories @xcite .",
    "all these models , when formulated in the einstein frame , share the same general behavior : the universe starts from an asymptotically flat state and undergoes a contraction that pumps the space - time curvature up to the new physics scale . at this point , the new physics masters the transition to an expanding phase and the standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe begins . in the present literature ,",
    "such models are generically called _",
    "bouncing cosmologies_.    the interest in bouncing cosmological models comes from the fact that an accelerated contraction seems to solve the flatness and horizon problems as efficiently as a standard inflationary phase .",
    "then the question opens whether a bouncing cosmology may replace standard inflation once and for all . in order to achieve this fascinating objective",
    ", a bouncing cosmology should provide its own mechanism of generation of the inhomogeneities of the universe , in such a way that all present constraints are satisfied at the same accuracy level of standard inflation .",
    "the most stringent observational constraint comes from cmb anisotropies , which require the initial power spectrum of the bardeen potential ( encoding the information on all scalar cosmological perturbations ) to be ( nearly ) scale - invariant .",
    "is this obtainable or not in a bouncing cosmology ?",
    "the first studies in the pre - big bang scenario gave a negative answer @xcite , indicating that the inhomogeneities must have an independent origin .",
    "for example , they can be generated in an axion - dominated era through the curvaton mechanism @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the authors of the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario @xcite claimed that a scale - invariant spectrum can be generated in a slow contraction era and transmitted across the bounce .",
    "this has risen a considerable debate @xcite about the correct way to describe the evolution of perturbations through a bounce , but , after several years of investigation , it seems quite difficult to draw a general conclusion , valid for all models of bouncing cosmologies .",
    "the evolution of perturbations in a bouncing cosmology can be summarized very quickly as follows : in the pre - bounce phase , the bardeen potential has a growing mode , endowed with a red spectrum ( becoming scale - invariant in the limit of very slow contraction @xcite ) and a decaying mode with a blue spectrum ( becoming scale - invariant in the limit of dust - dominated contraction @xcite ) .",
    "after the bounce , we have two alternatives : either the spectrum of the growing mode is inherited by a constant mode in the post - bounce or the growing mode simply decays in the post - bounce and some other constant mode with a more blue spectrum dominates at horizon re - entry .",
    "if the first possibility occurs , then the ekpyrotic / cyclic models would become a complete alternative to standard inflation . otherwise , a curvaton mechanism or some other one",
    "must be implemented to make such models compatible with observations .",
    "all studies of specific ( spatially flat ) toy models , where perturbations are explicitly calculable , show that the pre - bounce growing mode decays in the post - bounce and the bardeen potential is finally dominated by a blue spectrum , incompatible with observations @xcite ( the incorrect conclusions reached in refs .",
    "@xcite are revised in ref .",
    "@xcite and reconciled with all other studies ; also the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is a particular case of the general model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , with two perfect fluids with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the investigation of specific models does not allow to infer any general conclusions , since the possibility that some still unknown new physics may intervene at the bounce , producing different effects , remains open .",
    "indeed , bounces induced by positive spatial curvature show a different behavior , with a generic mixing between growing and decaying modes .",
    "the description of the evolution of scalar perturbations through a bounce has acquired an independent interest that goes beyond the ekpyrotic / cyclic models , thanks to the mathematical complexity of the problem , which poses several questions and issues of general theoretical interest .    in this work we present a completely analytical study of scalar perturbations in spatially flat bouncing cosmologies , making the only assumption that the bounce is governed by a single physical scale . in this way , we are able to establish a univocal relation between the final spectrum of perturbations and the form of the total energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we thus introduce a sort of golden rule for scalar perturbations in bouncing cosmologies .    in sect .",
    "2 we define the generic bouncing cosmology , stating the hypotheses that we need to deduce our general result . in sect .",
    "3 we elaborate our hypotheses , describing the background cosmology . in sect .",
    "4 we write the linear perturbation equations . in sect .",

    "6 we compute the evolution of perturbations in the pre - bounce , in the bounce and in the post - bounce . in sect .",
    "7 we illustrate the general results of sect . 6 by some numerical examples . in sect .",
    "8 we consider possible extensions to models with extra - dimensions and analyze the differences between bounces in spatially flat universes and bounces in spatially closed universes . sect .",
    "9 contains the conclusions .",
    "let us start by enumerating our hypotheses :    * we assume that it makes sense to define a four - dimensional metric tensor , both in the gr regime and in the new physics regime .",
    "then it is possible to write the four - dimensional einstein equations with an effective energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side , encoding all the corrections dictated by the new physics . *",
    "the universe is homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat , thus being described by the frw metric .",
    "* there is a unique physical scale @xmath3 governing the bounce .",
    "we will set our units in such a way that @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "* in the gr regime far from the bounce ( @xmath7 ) , the energy momentum tensor is characterized by a constant equation of state and a constant speed of sound , with @xmath8 .    in sect .",
    "8 , we will comment on models with extra - dimensions which may fit into hypothesis ( i ) and discuss the differences with positive curvature bounces .",
    "now let us work out these hypotheses .",
    "the metric , including scalar perturbations , is @xmath9dx^i dx^j \\right\\},\\ ] ] where we have used the conformal time @xmath10 .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath11 , while @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are scalar perturbations .    the total energy",
    " momentum tensor reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy density perturbation , @xmath18 is the pressure perturbation , @xmath19 is the velocity potential and @xmath20 is the anisotropic stress .",
    "note that these expressions do not require gr , but are just dictated by the symmetry of the problem ( hypothesis ( ii ) ) .",
    "thus , also in the bounce regime , the new physics corrections encoded in @xmath21 will respect this symmetry and contribute to its components , both at the background and at the perturbative level . since this tensor stays on the right hand side of the einstein equations ,",
    "it must be compatible with the bianchi identities , thus it must be covariantly conserved : @xmath22 .",
    "the independent background einstein equations and the energy - momentum conservation give the friedman equations @xmath23 where the prime denotes derivative w.r.t . @xmath10 and @xmath24 is the conformal hubble rate .    in a spatially flat universe the null energy condition ( nec ) , which amounts to require @xmath25 , must be necessarily violated during the bounce .",
    "of course , this violation can not be achieved by ordinary matter , but requires the intervention of the new physics .",
    "one may object that this implies the presence of ghosts at the quantum level .",
    "while the majority of explicit bouncing cosmologies in the literature indeed contain ghosts , there are at least two counterexamples .",
    "the first is the model by gasperini , giovannini and veneziano @xcite , where the nec violation is performed by a potential for the scalar field involving integration on the spatial volume of the universe .",
    "the second is the model by biswas , mazumdar and siegel @xcite , where the generalized gravitational action is an analytic function of the dalembert operator acting on the curvature scalar without poles . in both cases",
    "there are no ghosts in the theory . in any case , the possible existence of ghosts for a finite time interval may not be a problem at all @xcite .",
    "now let us determine the background evolution far from the bounce , using hypothesis ( iv ) . in the pre - bounce we have @xmath26 and in the post - bounce @xmath27 , with constant @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the restriction @xmath30 excludes the possibility of a post - bounce inflation , which would spoil the results of the bounce . on the other hand , a pre - bounce deflation , excluded by the restriction @xmath31 ,",
    "would make the setting of initial conditions in the asymptotic past problematic .",
    "we set @xmath32 at the bounce , defined as the time where @xmath33 .",
    "the bounce duration scale must be of the same order of the curvature scale , according to hypothesis ( iii ) .",
    "otherwise , there would be two independent scales .",
    "so , the bounce will last from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "then , the pre - bounce background functions have the power law behavior @xmath36 where we have chosen all constant of integration in such a way that the space - time curvature at the onset of the bounce @xmath37 is of order 1 .    in the same way , we can write the post - bounce behavior of the background functions , which will be analogous to eqs .",

    "some of the coefficients of these equations become singular at the bounce ( @xmath50 ) or at the nec violation time ( @xmath51 ) . in order to check the regularity of our variables",

    "@xmath43 has no divergences ( since @xmath54 at the nec violation time , thanks to the continuity equation ) , while for @xmath55 we should use the regularized variable @xmath56 .",
    "dealing with regularized variables is absolutely necessary in all numerical applications , because no integrator can step through a divergence .",
    "however , for our analytical arguments , it is completely equivalent to discuss the equations ( [ eqdrho])-([eqpsi ] ) or their regularized counterparts .",

    "in order to discuss the evolution of perturbations through the bounce , we need to specify the form of the sources . in the ignorance of the new physics governing the bounce",
    ", we can still select all admissible forms of the pressure perturbation and the anisotropic stress and make a complete discussion of what can be expected at the end of the bounce .",
    "firstly , let us deal with the pressure perturbation , leaving aside the anisotropic stress for the moment .",
    "the pressure perturbation can be a generic linear combination of @xmath17 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and a certain number @xmath73 of additional internal variables @xmath74 , with time depending coefficients .",
    "of course , the pressure perturbation may also depend on the time and space derivatives of these variables .",

    "we are not interested in any new spectral dependence whose origin is different from vacuum normalization of the original scalar degree of freedom . indeed ,",
    "if such spectral dependences are carried by these internal variables , they may play an important role , giving rise to additional isocurvature modes in the post - bounce , as in the model discussed in ref .",
    "they depend on the specific model and must be carefully considered in any complete treatment . however , our question is more general and only involves the fate of the original spectrum of @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ". the internal variables may acquire this spectrum only if @xmath42 , @xmath41 and their derivatives explicitly appear in their equations of motion .",
    "but then their feedback on @xmath18 would be an effective renormalization of the coefficients of @xmath42 , @xmath41 and their derivatives in the expression of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18 is then just a linear combination of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and their derivatives with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "however , @xmath18 is scalar under spatial rotations and thus it must contain only scalars .",
    "the time derivatives of scalars are still scalars under spatial rotation , but the spatial derivatives must be combined with themselves or other vectors of the theory in order to produce scalars .",
    "more specifically , the spatial derivatives can only appear as @xmath75 or @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a generic 3-vector of the theory",
    ". however , since the background is homogeneous and isotropic , all 3-vectors in the background must be zero .",
    "so , spatial derivatives can only appear in a laplacian or a function of the laplacian .",
    "summing up , the most general expression for @xmath18 is @xmath78 where we have supposed that the dependence on the laplacians is analytic and allows a regular power expansion and we have introduced the factor @xmath79 for later convenience . using the fourier mode expansion , the laplacians have been written as @xmath80 . with the same arguments , a similar expression should also hold for the anisotropic stress @xmath81 of course , any possible crossed dependence between @xmath18 and @xmath20 can be easily solved at the linear level .",
    "then the physics of the model is completely encoded in the time - dependent operators @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 . let us make some examples .    for a single perfect fluid or a scalar field , as mentioned before , the only non - vanishing operator is @xmath86 . in the bounce induced by two perfect fluids or scalar fields , studied in ref .",

    "the model by gasperini , giovannini and veneziano @xcite is simpler , since it contains no internal variables and the only non - vanishing operator is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the dilaton field in their model .",
    "cartier s model @xcite has a very involved effective energy - momentum tensor with a non - vanishing anisotropic stress . using the expressions in the appendix of his work , we find that the covariant conservation is fulfilled only in the trivial case @xmath92 , @xmath93 , indicating that some misprint may be present in the expressions published therein .",

    "we are thus left with @xmath119 comparing this solution with the expansion of the hankel functions for small arguments , given by eqs .",

    "now let us turn to the core of our work .",
    "it must be said that the specific shape of the solution during the bounce is not our concern , since we just want to know the final spectrum of scalar perturbations when they reenter the horizon .",

    ", the spectrum would be totally determined by the blue constant mode @xmath144 , that in the very slow contraction limit @xmath155 gives a spectral index @xmath156 .",
    "the final possibility is that the universe has undergone a fast pre - bounce contraction @xmath71 , so that the largest constant mode is @xmath147 . in this case , the decaying mode dominates when the expansion is slow ( @xmath157 ) , while is negligible otherwise .",
    "the modes dominating at horizon re - entry in all cases are summarized by the following diagram    @xmath158    at the same time , we see that there is a direct correspondence between the modes present in @xmath41 and those in @xmath42 , so that an analogous discussion is valid also for @xmath42 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a dependence on @xmath41 or its time derivatives in the anisotropic stress does not produce any sizeable effects on the scalar perturbations .",
    "the anisotropic stress enters without laplacians in the equation for @xmath41 , where , at most , it may renormalize the amplitude of the decaying mode . in the equation for @xmath42",
    "it comes through a laplacian , thus being completely ineffective .",
    "a very important _ caveat _ to keep in mind is that the presence of a dependence on @xmath41 in @xmath18 is just a necessary condition for the persistence of the @xmath148 spectrum in a post - bounce constant mode .",
    "in fact , bounces with particular symmetries may bring to special cancellations in the integrals , erasing the lowest order contributions to the constant mode and leaving space to higher order ( most blue ) contributions .",
    "another possibility is that the internal variables of the new physics at the bounce may provide new modes characterized by alternative spectra with a different physical origin w.r.t .",
    "quantum fluctuations in the initial vacuum state .",
    "these modes may contribute to the constant mode at the end of the bounce , providing another possible alternative source for phenomenologically acceptable scalar perturbations .",
    "however , in such case , the phenomenology would completely rely on the high energy physics at the bounce , whereas it would be preferable that the final spectrum is as independent as possible of the unknown bounce physics .",
    "our conclusions seem quite similar to those reached by durrer and vernizzi in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the bounce is replaced by a spacelike hypersurface and the evolution of perturbations through the bounce is determined by israel conditions .",
    "in fact , they find that the persistence of the growing mode of the bardeen potential in the post - bounce era is very general , while its decay occurs only if the bounce hypersurface coincides with the uniform energy density hypersurface , which corresponds to force the surface tension to be proportional to @xmath89 . reinterpreting the surface tension as an integral of the pressure perturbation during the bounce , this would correspond to tune @xmath138 in our expression for @xmath18 . thus , the two approaches seem in complete agreement .",
    "our golden rule for scalar perturbations through bouncing cosmologies is based on a fully analytical derivation .",
    "however , it is useful to visualize the main conclusions on some toy models of bouncing cosmologies , so that they can be touched `` by hand '' . in order to make things as simple as possible ,",
    "we have considered a bounce with two perfect fluids : the first dominating the pre - bounce and post - bounce eras and the second , being characterized by negative energy density , representing the new physics effective tensor inducing the bounce . for a bounce with two perfect fluids , the friedman equations are also integrable in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite , though we will not use the analytical solutions .",
    "so , in this section , @xmath159 is the energy density of the first fluid and @xmath160 is the energy density of the second fluid .",

    "the post - bounce phase is the time - reversal of the pre - bounce phase .",
    "we are thus unable to directly investigate a fast contraction followed by a slow expansion or a slow contraction followed by a fast expansion .",
    "such asymmetric bouncing cosmologies require the implementation of decay of the pre - bounce matter and creation of new matter at the bounce , which would make the model much more complicated , though not impossible to treat .",
    "after the background is determined , we have to specify the form of the energy - momentum tensor for perturbations .",
    "we choose @xmath169    in the comoving pressure perturbation @xmath18 we have included three terms .",
    "the first one is the classical adiabatic perturbation of the first fluid , which is necessary to reproduce the ordinary physics in the pre - bounce and post - bounce phases .",
    "the other two terms are multiplied by the density of the secondary fluid , which becomes negligible far from the bounce .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath42 is the same that one would have by the requirement that the perturbations in the secondary fluid vanish in the gauge @xmath170 .",
    "this choice is not essential and has been made just for computational reasons .",
    "the last term is a `` new physics '' term directly proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "we will switch it on or off by setting @xmath171 or @xmath138 , respectively . here",
    "we only present a model with vanishing anisotropic stress , as this plays no role in the final result , apart from a renormalization of some modes .",
    "of course , we have checked that this is actually the case , testing some models ( not to be presented here ) with non - vanishing anisotropic stress at the bounce .    with this choice for the energy - momentum tensor of perturbations ,",
    "the equations of motion are simply @xmath172 as anticipated before , it is safer to use @xmath173 in all numerical applications , since this variable is guaranteed to be regular throughout the bounce if any regular gauge exists .    imposing the vacuum normalization as the initial condition ,",

    "indeed , choosing a function going to zero faster than @xmath188 far from the bounce , we can delay the growth of @xmath42 as much as we like .",

    "we want to stress that this outcome is completely independent of the expansion and contraction rates and of the specific form of the background function that appears in the coupling of @xmath18 to @xmath41 .",

    "the decaying mode is taken over by a constant mode with a spectrum @xmath147 .",
    "in hypothesis ( ii ) we have excluded the presence of spatial curvature . indeed",
    ", this would introduce another scale in our problem and in order to be compatible with hypothesis ( iii ) , we have two possibilities .",
    "the first is that the curvature scale is very low compared to the bounce scale .",
    "then the universe is practically spatially flat and we can neglect the spatial curvature to follow the treatment of this paper .",
    "the second is that the curvature itself determines the bounce so that the curvature scale at the bounce is actually what we have called @xmath6 .",
    "spatial curvature may induce a cosmological bounce only if it is positive , because it enters the friedman equation as a perfect fluid with negative energy density and equation of state @xmath190 .",
    "the remaining source - matter may keep satisfying @xmath25 , since the effective nec violation is performed by the spatial curvature . in order to let the curvature become negligible before and after the bounce , we need @xmath191 , i.e. decelerated contraction and accelerated expansion .",
    "for example , the pre - bounce and the post - bounce phases may be dominated by sources with equations of state @xmath192 .",
    "this contradicts our hypothesis ( iv ) and the initial conditions would be problematic without another early transition from an accelerated contraction in the far pre - bounce .",
    "this possibility was considered by several authors as a toy model for a bouncing cosmology .",
    "however , even relaxing hypothesis ( iv ) , there is a structural difference between a bounce induced by spatial curvature and all other bounces with negligible spatial curvature scale .",
    "in fact , the laplace - beltrami operator in a positively curved space has a discrete spectrum @xmath193 ( recall that the curvature scale at the bounce has been set to 1 ) .",
    "then , all modes are in the situation @xmath194 , that means that all modes are _ inside _ the horizon at the bounce",
    ". then our recursive solution of the integral equation would require an infinite number of terms and is completely useless . in practice , all modes re - enter the horizon during the pre - bounce deflation and oscillate in the approach to the bounce . during the inflationary phase after the bounce",
    ", they exit the horizon again , stopping the oscillations . this behavior has been put in evidence by deruelle @xcite , who has described the oscillations analytically by hypergeometric functions .",
    "then , it is not surprising that mode mixing after the oscillations is a generic outcome of such scenarios .",
    "we have to conclude that bounces with positive curvature have a substantially different physics and can not be used as a step to investigate bounces in spatially flat universes .",
    "then it is difficult to believe that they could be useful for any physically motivated models .",
    "however , there is one remarkable feature of spatial curvature that deserves to be mentioned . we have already noted that spatial curvature behaves as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath195 at the background level . at the linear perturbation level",
    ", we may try to recast all equations in such a way that they look like eqs .",
    "( [ eqdrho])-([eqpsi ] ) with some effective energy - momentum tensor containing the curvature terms . after some manipulation , we find the following form for the perturbations induced by the spatial curvature in the comoving gauge @xmath196    spatial curvature thus represents a very interesting example of some `` new physics '' with a pressure perturbation directly proportional to @xmath41 and its time derivative without the laplacian .",
    "so , even if spatial curvature is not useful for realistic bouncing cosmologies by itself , it encourages the conjecture that the new physics driving the bounce may contain terms directly proportional to the bardeen potential in the effective energy - momentum tensor of perturbations .",
    "perhaps an even more interesting surprise comes out from extra - dimensions . in some particular cases , in fact , it is possible to recast d - dimensional field equations in the form of 4-dimensional friedman equations with some effective energy - momentum tensor containing the dynamics of the extra - dimensions .",
    "one example is the case in which the spacetime is factored into a 4-dimensional frw metric and an internal homogeneous manifold , where none of the metric components depends on the coordinates spanning the internal space .",
    "for example , consider a five - dimensional spacetime with the metric @xmath197dx^i dx^j \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\&&-b^2(\\eta)(1 + 2\\gamma)dy^2 - 2wdtdy,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the assumption that all scalar perturbations do not depend on the internal coordinate @xmath198 ( i.e. we are only including zero modes and neglecting excitations of the extra - dimensions ) .",
    "this metric was used by battefeld , patil and brandenberger @xcite to study bounces with extra - dimensions .",
    "it is easy to show that the background equations have the form of 4-dimensional friedman equations with an effective contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor coming from the extra - dimension @xmath199 where the ( yy ) component of the einstein equations has been used to eliminate @xmath200 .    in the same way ,",
    "examining the perturbations equations , we can re - obtain eqs .",
    "( [ eqdrho])-([eqpsi ] ) with effective @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 containing terms depending on @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath204 and their derivatives ( @xmath205 decouples from other perturbations ) .",
    "thus , @xmath204 plays the role of internal variable of the model .",
    "its dynamical equation is given by the perturbed ( yy ) component , with @xmath206 as a source .",
    "we will not present the complete expressions of the perturbed effective energy - momentum tensor here , but the important lesson is that the presence of terms directly proportional to @xmath41 in @xmath18 is generic in this class of models as well .",
    "then , bounces with extra - dimensions may be able to transfer the pre - bounce spectrum of @xmath41 to the post - bounce .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fact that extra - dimensions perturbations contribute to the pressure perturbation was already noted by giovannini @xcite .",
    "coherently with the behavior of scalar perturbations , he also finds that vector perturbations in multi - dimensional bouncing universes preserve the red spectrum acquired in the contraction phase , in contrast with 4-dimensional bouncing universes , where the red spectrum is only transferred to the decaying mode @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a complete analysis of scalar perturbations in multi - dimensional bouncing universes that also takes into account non - zero modes is still missing .",
    "their relevance certainly deserves some investigation , but they can not fit into the effective four - dimensional picture presented in this paper .",
    "further extensions of our methodology are certainly possible .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the general solution for scalar perturbations in bouncing cosmologies , i.e. models of the universe where the present expansion is preceded by a contraction phase .",
    "this solution has been derived solving integral equations where the only assumption on the bounce is that it depends on a single physical scale .",
    "the `` new physics '' ruling the bounce has been encoded in an effective energy - momentum tensor , for which we have made no _ a priori _ assumption .",
    "the final spectrum of the bardeen potential in the expansion phase depends on the presence or absence in the new physics energy - momentum tensor of a direct relation between the comoving pressure perturbation and the bardeen potential , not mediated by a laplacian , as in all known forms of ordinary matter .",
    "if such term is present , the pre - bounce growing mode of the bardeen potential persists in the post - bounce constant mode and it is possible to have a phenomenologically acceptable scale - invariant spectrum in ekpyrotic - like cosmologies ( i.e. models with very slow contraction in the pre - bounce ) .",
    "if such term is absent , the pre - bounce growing mode of the bardeen potential decays in the post - bounce and becomes negligible w.r.t . a blue constant mode , unless the post - bounce expansion is slower than the pre - bounce contraction .",
    "the negative conclusion reached by all regular models of 4-dimensional spatially flat bounces studied up to now is due to the absence of such dependence in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "then , in order to support our conclusion , we have presented a numerical study of a toy model with @xmath207 which transfers the spectrum of the pre - bounce growing mode of @xmath41 to the post - bounce growing mode .",
    "bounces induced by spatial curvature are structurally different from spatially flat bounces , since all modes are inside the horizon for some time interval centered at the bounce . our treatment can not be applied to this distinct category of bounces , whose study is anyway useless for the understanding of bounces in spatially flat cosmologies . however",
    ", spatial curvature provides a remarkable example of an effective energy - momentum tensor where the pressure perturbation is proportional to the bardeen potential without laplacians .",
    "the same key property is also possessed by models of bounces with extra - dimensions where the dependence on the coordinates spanning the internal space is neglected .",
    "these multi - dimensional models can fit into our effective four - dimensional scheme .",
    "however , before drawing a positive conclusion , a more rigorous and complete treatment ( taking into account non - zero modes ) should be envisaged for multi - dimensional bounces .",
    "it thus seems not impossible to conjecture a form for the new physics driving the bounce that realizes the ekpyrotic dream .",
    "the problem now is not in matching conditions or any technical issues about the evolution of perturbations , which are now definitively settled by this work .",
    "the missing ring of the chain is just the existence of some explicit model with the required property of the effective energy - momentum tensor and that is physically motivated by a consistent high energy theory like string or m - theory .",
    "when this explicit model is found , then it will be possible to say that a real alternative to standard inflation exists .",
    "on the other hand , a more prudent attitude suggests the possibility that there might exist some important physical reasons precluding the possibility that an effective energy - momentum tensor of the required form is allowed at the bounce and then the way for bouncing cosmologies would be definitively barred .",
    "however , it seems very hard to us to find any physical reason to forbid an effective pressure perturbation directly proportional to the bardeen potential .",
    "moreover , the explicit examples of spatial curvature and extra - dimensions seem to indicate that this possibility is actually open for high energy theories .",

    "<S> we determine the evolution of perturbations and the final spectrum for an arbitrary ( spatially flat ) bouncing cosmology , with the only assumption that the bounce is governed by a single physical scale . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the spectrum of the pre - bounce growing mode of the bardeen potential ( which is scale - invariant in some limit , and thus compatible with observations ) survives unaltered in the post - bounce only if the comoving pressure perturbation is directly proportional to the bardeen potential rather than its laplacian , as for any known form of ordinary matter . </S>",
    "<S> if some new physics acting at the bounce justifies such relation , then bouncing cosmologies are entitled to become a real viable alternative for the generation of the observed inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment also includes some class of models with extra - dimensions , whereas we show that bounces induced by positive spatial curvature are structurally different from all bounces in spatially flat universes , requiring a distinct analysis . </S>"
