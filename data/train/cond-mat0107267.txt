    "the epidemiology of heterogeneous networks has largely benefitted from the need of understanding the spreading of human sexual diseases in the complex web of sexual partnership @xcite .",
    "epidemic modeling considered that population groups can be characterized in classes having different sexual activity or number of sexual contacts .",
    "this fact leads to models dealing with heterogeneous populations which are known to enhance the spread of infections as well as make them harder to eradicate ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this perspective",
    ", a limiting case is represented by the newly identified classes of complex networks ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the highly heterogeneous topology of these networks is mainly reflected in the small average path lengths among any two nodes ( small - world property ) @xcite , and in a power law distribution ( scale - free property ) , @xmath0 , for the probability that any node has @xmath1 connections to other nodes @xcite . while regular networks present finite connectivity fluctuations ( @xmath2 ) , scale - free ( sf ) networks are a limiting case of heterogeneity where connectivity fluctuations are diverging if @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , the network nodes possess a statistically significant probability of having a virtually unbounded number of connections compared to the average value .",
    "sf networks find real examples in several technological networks such as the internet @xcite and the world - wide - web ( www ) @xcite , as well as in natural systems such as food - webs , and metabolic or protein networks @xcite .",
    "the need to understand the dynamics of information transmission , the error tolerance @xcite and other properties of complex networks has therefore called for the study of epidemic modeling in complex networks @xcite .    a surprising result , originated by the inspection of the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model , has shown that the spread of infections is tremendously strengthened on sf networks @xcite .",
    "opposite to standard models , epidemic processes in these networks do not possess any epidemic threshold below which the infection can not produce a major epidemic outbreak or an endemic state . in principle , sf networks are prone to the persistence of diseases whatever infective rate they may have .",
    "this feature reverberates also in the choice of immunization strategies @xcite and changes radically many standard conclusions on epidemic spreading .",
    "this study appears particularly relevant in the case of technological networks , for instance for the spreading of digital viruses in the internet @xcite , and it has soon been generalized by showing that also the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model show the same absence of epidemic threshold @xcite .",
    "these results highlight the study of epidemic models in complex networks as potentially relevant also in human and animal epidemiology @xcite , as confirmed recently by the experimental observation that the web architecture of sexual contacts is best described by a scale - free topology in which individuals have widely different connectivities @xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide a detailed analytical and numerical study of the sir model on two prototype complex networks : the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model and the barabsi -albert ( ba ) model .",
    "the first model is a small - world network with bounded connectivity fluctuations , while the second one is the prototype example of sf network .",
    "the analytical approach allows us to recover the total size of the epidemics in an infinite population , in agreement with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "we are able to find the analytic expression for the critical threshold as a function of the moments of the connectivity distribution and we confirm the absence of any finite threshold for connectivity distributions @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "we obtain the general analytic expression for the total density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold at arbitrary @xmath6 values .",
    "finite size network effects can be easily evaluated from the analytic expressions .",
    "time evolution and other effects of heterogeneity such as the relative infection incidence in different connectivity classes can be predicted . in order to confirm the analytical findings we perform large scale numerical simulations on the ws and ba networks .",
    "numerical results are in perfect agreement with the analytical predictions and confirm that the interplay of complex networks topology and epidemic modeling leads to a new and interesting theoretical framework , whose predictions and implications need to be exhaustively explored .    during the completion of this paper we became aware of a preprint by lloyd and",
    "may @xcite which reports a comprehensive study of the sir model in scale free networks .",
    "this work extends the preliminary account provided in ref .",
    "our theoretical understanding of epidemic spreading is based on compartmental models , in which the individuals in the population are divided in a discrete set of states @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "diseases which result in the immunization or death of infected individuals can be characterized by the classical susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite . in this",
    "model individuals can only exist in three different states : susceptible ( healthy ) , infected , or removed ( immunized or dead ) . in a homogeneous system , the sir model can be described in terms of the densities of susceptible , infected , and removed individuals , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , as a function of time .",
    "these three magnitudes are linked through the normalization condition @xmath10 and they obey the following system of differential equations : @xmath11 these equations can be interpreted as follows : infected individuals decay into the removed class at a rate @xmath12 , while susceptibles individual become infected at a rate proportional to both the densities of infected and susceptible individuals . here , @xmath13 is the microscopic spreading ( infection ) rate , and @xmath14 is the number of contacts per unit time that is supposed to be constant for the whole population . in writing this last term of the equations we are assuming the _ homogeneous mixing _",
    "hypothesis @xcite , which asserts that the force of the infection ( the per capita rate of acquisition of the disease by the susceptible individuals ) is proportional to the density of infectious individuals .",
    "the homogeneous mixing hypothesis is indeed equivalent to a mean - field treatment of the model , in which one assumes that the rate of contacts between infectious and susceptibles is constant , and independent of any possible source of heterogeneity present in the system .",
    "another implicit assumption of this model is that the time scale of the disease is much smaller than the lifespan of individuals ; therefore we do not include in the equations terms accounting for the birth or natural death of individuals .",
    "the most significant prediction of this model is the presence of a nonzero epidemic threshold @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if the value of @xmath13 is above @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the disease spreads and infects a finite fraction of the population . on the other hand , when @xmath13 is below the threshold , @xmath17 , the total number of infected individuals ( the epidemic incidence ) , @xmath18 , is infinitesimally small in the limit of very large populations ( the so - called thermodynamic limit @xcite ) . in order to see this point ,",
    "let us consider the set of equations ( [ eq : primiser ] ) , in which , without lack of generality , we set @xmath19 . integrating the equation for @xmath7 with the initial conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( i.e. , assuming @xmath22 , a very small initial concentration of infected individuals ) , we obtain @xmath23 combining this result with the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) , we observe that the total number of infected individuals @xmath24 fulfills the following self - consistent equation : @xmath25 while @xmath26 is always a solution of this equation , in order to have a nonzero solution the following condition must be fulfilled : @xmath27 this condition is equivalent to the constraint @xmath16 , where the epidemic threshold @xmath15 takes the value @xmath28 in this particular case . by using a taylor expansion at @xmath29",
    "it is then possible to obtain the epidemic incidence behavior @xmath30 ( valid above the epidemic threshold ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the threshold mechanism is related to the basic reproductive rate @xmath31 ( not to be confused with removed individuals ) usually considered by epidemiologist .",
    "only if @xmath32 is larger than unity the infection can sustain itself , obviously defining a threshold in the spreading rate @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "as well , in the language of the physics of nonequilibrium phase transition @xcite , the epidemic threshold can be considered as completely equivalent to a critical point . in analogy with critical phenomena , we can consider @xmath24 as the order parameter of a phase transition and @xmath13 as the tuning parameter .",
    "in particular , it is easy to recognize that the sir model is a generalization of the dynamical percolation model , that has been extensively studied in the context of absorbing - state phase transitions@xcite .",
    "in order to address the effects of contact heterogeneity in epidemic spreading , let us consider the sir model defined on a network with general connectivity distribution @xmath33 and a finite average connectivity @xmath34 .",
    "each node of the network represents an individual in its corresponding state ( susceptible , infected , or removed ) , and each link is a connection along which the infection can spread . the disease transmission on the network is described in an effective way : at each time step , each susceptible node is infected with probability @xmath13 , if it is connected to one or more infected nodes . at the same time , each infected individual becomes removed with probability @xmath12 , that , without lack of generality , we set equal to unity .    in order to take into account the heterogeneity induced by the presence of nodes with different connectivity",
    ", we consider the time evolution of the magnitudes @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , which are the density of infected , susceptible , and removed nodes of connectivity @xmath1 at time @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "these variables are connected by means of the normalization condition @xmath39 global quantities such as the epidemic incidence are therefore expressed by an average over the various connectivity classes ; i.e. @xmath40 . at the mean - field level , these densities satisfy the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath41 the factor @xmath42 represents the probability that any given link points to an infected site .",
    "this quantity can be computed in a self - consistent way @xcite : the probability that a link points to a node with @xmath43 links is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the probability that a randomly chosen link points to an infected node is given by @xmath45 in this approximation we are neglecting the connectivity correlations in the network , i.e. , the probability that a link points to an infected node is considered independent of the connectivity of the node from which the link is emanating .",
    "a more refined approximation would consider the network correlations as given by the conditional probability @xmath46 that a node with given connectivity @xmath47 is connected to a node with connectivity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see in the next sections , this rather crude approximation is quite able to give account of many of the properties shown by computer simulations of the model .    the equations ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) , combined with the initial conditions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 completely define the sir model on any complex network with connectivity distribution @xmath33",
    ". we will consider in particular the case of a homogeneous initial distribution of infected nodes , @xmath51 . in this case , in the limit @xmath52 , we can substitute @xmath53 and @xmath54 . under this approximation ,",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) can be directly integrated , yielding @xmath55 where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath56 and in the last equality we have made use of the definition ( [ eq : definition ] ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the above equations are similar to those obtained in the case of hiv dynamics in heterogeneous populations @xcite    in order to get a closed relation for the total density of infected individuals , it results more convenient to focus on the time evolution of the averaged magnitude @xmath57 . to this purpose ,",
    "let us compute its time derivative : @xmath58 introducing the obtained time dependence of @xmath36 we are led to the differential equation for @xmath59 @xmath60 once solved eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalphi ] ) , we can obtain the total epidemic incidence @xmath24 as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 equations ( [ eq : generalphi ] ) and ( [ eq : rigeneral ] ) constitute thus an alternative representation of the model , with respect to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) .    for a general @xmath33 distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalphi ] ) can not be solved in a closed form .",
    "however , we can still get useful information on the infinite time limit ; i.e. at the end of the epidemics . since we have that @xmath64 and consequently @xmath65 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalphi ] ) the following self - consistent equation for @xmath66 @xmath67 the value @xmath68 is always a solution . in order to have a non - zero solution ,",
    "the condition @xmath69 must be fulfilled .",
    "this relation implies @xmath70 this condition defines the epidemic threshold @xmath71 below which the epidemic incidence is null , and above which it attains a finite value .",
    "that is , the threshold is inversely proportional to the connectivity fluctuations @xmath72 . for regular networks , in which @xmath73",
    ", the threshold has a finite value and we are in the presence of a standard phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "networks with strongly fluctuating connectivity distribution , show a _ vanishing _ epidemic threshold for increasing network sizes ; i.e. @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the absence of any intrinsic epidemic threshold in this network can be understood by noticing that in heterogeneous systems the basic reproductive number @xmath32 contains a correction term linearly dependent on the fluctuations ( standard deviation ) of the nodes connectivity distribution @xcite . in sf networks",
    "the divergence of the connectivity fluctuations leads to an @xmath32 that always exceeds unity whatever the spreading rate @xmath13 is .",
    "this ensures that epidemics always have a finite probability to survive indefinitely .",
    "it is worth remarking that real networks have always a finite size @xmath76 and thus an effective threshold , depending on the magnitude of @xmath77 and @xmath72 , that can be easily calculated as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "this apparent threshold , however is not an intrinsic quantity and it is extremely small for systems with large enough @xmath76 .",
    "the class of exponential networks refers to random graph models which produce a connectivity distribution @xmath33 peaked at an average value @xmath78 and decaying exponentially fast for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "typical examples of such a network are the random graph model @xcite and the small - world model of watts and strogatz ( ws ) @xcite .",
    "the latter has recently been the object of several studies as a good candidate for the modeling of many realistic situations in the context of social and natural networks . in particular , the ws model shows the `` small - world '' property common in random graphs @xcite ; i.e. , the diameter of the graph  the shortest chain of links connecting any two vertices  increases very slowly , in general logarithmically with the network size @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ws model has also a local structure ( clustering property ) that is not found in random graphs with finite connectivity @xcite .",
    "the ws graph is defined as follows @xcite : the starting point is a ring with @xmath76 nodes , in which each node is symmetrically connected with its @xmath81 nearest neighbors .",
    "then , for every node each link connected to a clockwise neighbor is rewired to a randomly chosen node with probability @xmath82 , and preserved with probability @xmath83 .",
    "this procedure generates a random graph with a connectivity distributed exponentially for large @xmath1 @xcite , and an average connectivity @xmath84 .",
    "the graph has small - world properties and a non - trivial `` clustering coefficient '' ; i.e. , neighboring nodes share many common neighbors @xcite . the richness of this model has stimulated an intense activity aimed at understanding the network s properties upon changing @xmath82 and the network size @xmath76  @xcite . at the same time , the behavior of physical models on ws graphs has been investigated , including epidemiological percolation models @xcite and models with epidemic cycles @xcite .    in the following we focus on the ws model with @xmath85",
    "; it is worth noticing that even in this extreme case the network retains some memory of the generating procedure .",
    "the network , in fact , is not locally equivalent to a random graph in that each node has at least @xmath86 neighbors . in the limit @xmath87 ,",
    "the connectivity distribution of the ws network , as defined previously , takes the form @xcite",

    "( [ eq : riexpo ] ) , with an epidemic threshold given by @xmath106 in order to compare with the analytical predictions we have carried out large scale simulations of the sir model in the ws network with @xmath85 . in our simulations we consider the ws network with parameter @xmath107 , which corresponds to an average connectivity @xmath108 .",

    "a linear fit to the form @xmath115 provides an exponent @xmath116 , in reasonable agreement with the analytical finding .",
    "this confirms that the sir model in exponentially bounded complex networks has a behavior similar to that obtained with the homogeneous mixing hypothesis . actually , since the connectivity fluctuations are very small in the ws graph ( @xmath117 ) , as a first approximation we can consider the ws model as a homogeneous one in which each node has the same number of links , @xmath118 .",

    "we shall see in the next section that this is not the case for sf networks .",

    "sf networks are therefore very weak in face of infections presenting an effective epidemic threshold that is vanishing in the limit @xmath75 . in the case of the sir model in an infinite population this corresponds to the absence of any epidemic threshold below which major epidemic outbreaks are impossible .",
    "these results strengthen the epidemiological framework for complex networks reported for the sis model @xcite and proposed as well for the sir model @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture is likely going to stimulate the re - analysis of several concepts of standard epidemiology such as the `` core group '' or the characteristic number of contacts that appears to be ill - defined in sf networks .",
    "the high heterogeneity of sf networks finds signatures also in the peculiar susceptibility to infections starting on the most connected individuals and the different relative incidence within populations of varying connectivity @xmath1 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that these features can point at better protection methods for these networks which appear to have practical realization in many technological and biological systems . in this perspective , the introductions of many elements of realism and a better knowledge of the networks temporal pattern are fundamental ingredients towards a better understanding of the spreading of information and epidemics in a wide range of complex interacting systems . + this work has been partially supported by the european network contract no .",
