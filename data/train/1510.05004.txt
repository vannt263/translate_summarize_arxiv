    "a molecular absorption system , in which molecular absorption occurs along the line - of - sight toward a radio - loud quasar , is a powerful tool for the investigation of the chemistry and physics of interstellar media ( ism ) , from those within galactic diffuse clouds to high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) galaxies .",
    "investigations of the ism at low excitation states in a distant system indicate higher sensitivity toward absorption than emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as the absorption line depths are independent of the distance to the system , but dependent on the brightness of the background sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ tab1 ]    [ tab2 ]    molecular absorption line systems at high-@xmath2 play an important role in the detection of molecules at high-@xmath2 with high sensitivity , and in investigation of their chemical evolution ( @xcite ( a review ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", observations of such distant systems can contribute to fundamental physics knowledge by allowing the cosmological variation of fundamental constants or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature as a function of @xmath2 to be probed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , note that only four objects are known to have high-@xmath2 molecular absorption at millimeter wavelength ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observation of molecular absorption lines in quasar host galaxies also facilitates investigation of gas structures around the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of edge - on host galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , absorption studies of such host galaxies may be useful in facilitating the direct observation of the putative molecular tori in agns , although no detection of this nature has been successfully performed to date ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even the molecular absorption inside our galaxy is of considerable interest .",
    "observations of molecular absorption lines in diffuse ism can improve our understanding of its chemistry .",
    "for example , such observations can allow determination of the isotope ratios of fundamental elements based on isotopologue column density ratios ( @xcite ) , and may reveal the chemical richness of diffuse ism by extending the molecular inventory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to investigate the physical and chemical states of diffuse ism , because such extended diffuse media are thought to be dominant in the interarm regions of our galaxy ( @xcite ) , and even account for a certain proportion of the total gas in our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "high spatial - resolution observation of the nearby spiral galaxy , m51 , also suggests that a diffuse thick disk of molecular gas extends broadly over that galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , investigation of the properties of diffuse ism may even facilitate further comprehension of galactic evolution . however , the detailed nature of diffuse molecular gas is poorly understood , primarily because emission studies experience critical difficulties in detecting such diffuse gases because of their low densities and low excitation temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "several diffuse ism heating mechanisms have been advocated in previous studies , for example , those based on turbulence ( @xcite ) and uv radiation from ob - stars ( @xcite ) ; however , there exist a limited number of studies observationally supporting such mechanisms from the point of view of the chemical states of diffuse molecular gases .",
    "meanwhile , absorption observations can potentially be used to examine the properties of diffuse ism .",
    "[ tab3 ]    to8ptthe errors of the peak optical depths and column densities stem from the uncertainty involved in the flux calibration , rms noise calculation , and line fits .",
    "to8ptthe data for the molecular lines with hyperfine structure components consist of the strongest values . to8ptusing a rotation diagram with two transition lines ,",
    "the total column density and @xmath3 of the main co component are determined to be @xmath4 @xmath5 and 6.2 k , respectively , and the @xmath3 of the weaker co velocity component is also assumed to be 6.2 k , although these results should be treated carefully ( see section 3 ) .",

    "@xmath7 systems have been noted ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , whereas the lines - of - sight toward a small number of bright sources , such as 3c111 , bl lac , and nrao530 , have been studied extensively ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , previous searches for molecular absorption systems have been limited in terms of sensitivity and velocity resolution .",
    "some of these investigations have reported non - detection ( e.g. @xcite ) , even though such studies have been useful in detecting rare molecular species ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) offers high sensitivity and velocity resolution , allowing researchers to obtain high - quality spectra even within short exposure times .",
    "the alma archival data offer a vast number of sensitive quasar spectra that have been primarily obtained for bandpass and complex gain calibration .",
    "thus , it is possible that alma has detected molecular absorption lines within the spectra of its calibrator sources , and such cases would equate to discoveries of new systems _ without _ any additional observation .",
    "in this paper , we present the first results of detections of molecular absorption systems using alma calibrator sources . in section 2",
    ", we show the data analysis method and , in section 3 , we report on the detection of four molecular absorption systems within the galaxy . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the hco absorption lines , as hco is the most noteworthy molecule detected in this study .",
    "we select 36 calibrator sources from the whole sky , which fulfill the following criteria : ( a ) the data are available in the alma archive from prior to late 2014 , i.e. , cycle 0 data ; ( b ) the continuum flux is detected at @xmath8 jy , so a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) can be expected in bands 3 , 6 , or 7 ; and ( c ) the data are taken at a frequency resolution of @xmath9 mhz in frequency division mode ( fdm ) .",
    "information on all the sources analyzed in the study is given in appendix 1 .",
    "we create three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubes from the calibrated visibilities of the bandpass and complex gain calibrators using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package ` clean ` task , with briggs weighting ( with a ` robust ` parameter of 0.5 ) .",
    "although the spectra of the majority of the calibrators exhibit featureless continua , significant absorption lines ( @xmath10 ) are detected in four objects observed in the six projects listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "detailed information on these objects is given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "when a bandpass calibrator also exhibits absorption lines , the calibration process is performed once more .",
    "the bandpass - calibrator frequency channels showing absorption lines ( typical widths of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 or @xmath13 mhz ) are flagged and linearly interpolated using nearby channels , as interpolation of this nature with a width of @xmath14 mhz does not seriously affect the calibration processes . then , the revised bandpass calibration is applied so as to yield the final spectrum of the complex gain calibrator . the spectrum of the flux calibrator ( the neptune in this case ) to which the interpolated bandpass calibration is applied does not exhibit any artificial features at the frequencies where the lines are found , suggesting that our bandpass interpolation is valid .",
    "the continuum spectrum is subtracted from that of the detected absorption lines using the ` imcontsub ` task , and the line spectrum is then divided by the continuum spectrum using the ` immath ` task ( we have confirmed that the same continuum subtraction is conducted in both the image and @xmath15 planes ) . therefore , the line / continuum flux density ratio values are in the @xmath16 - 0 range .",
    "the normalized line spectrum is then gaussian fitted to allow measurement of the central velocity , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and the absorption line depth , which are listed in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the velocity components are identified by comparing the profiles of the hyperfine structure lines and/or the multi - transition lines .",
    "the optical depth and column density of each molecule shown in table [ tab3 ] are calculated using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of greaves and nyman ( ) ( see appendix 2 for details ) , assuming that the excitation temperatures ( @xmath3 ) of the detected molecules are 2.73 k. this means that these molecules are taken to be in equilibrium with the cmb , as has been widely assumed in the previous studies on galactic molecular absorption systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further , this has been confirmed for some diffuse media observed toward galactic star - forming regions ( @xcite ) . with this assumption",
    ", we can derive optical depths from the line / continuum flux density ratios , which are free from flux calibration uncertainty ( @xmath17% ) .",
    "however , this assumption should be treated with caution if the ism in question is located in a photodissociation region ( pdr , see section 4 ) .",
    "even if @xmath3 is higher than 2.73 k , the measured column density ratios , such as those of @xmath18(hco)/@xmath18(h@xmath0co@xmath1 ) discussed in section 4 , do not change dramatically for molecules with similar @xmath3 .",
    "for example , if @xmath19 k , the inferred column densities of all species increase by almost the same factor ( @xmath20 ) for transition from the ground states ; this does not change the abundance ratios no more than 10% .",
    "such a discrepancy is negligible compared with the errors associated with the flux calibration , root - mean - square ( rms ) noise , and line fits .",
    "further analysis of the impact of @xmath3 and the uncertainty regarding column densities and their ratios will be conducted in a forthcoming paper ( ando et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , the frequency ranges we analyze include the line frequencies of various well - known molecules that are not detected in this work .",
    "table [ tab4 ] summarizes the @xmath21 upper limits of the peak optical depths and column densities of relatively major undetected species .",
    "of the 36 calibrators analyzed in this work , molecular absorption lines are detected toward the four objects listed in table @xmath22 .",
    "all of these are found to be galactic in origin , based on consideration of the line velocities . while the absorption line system found toward nrao530 has been identified in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , the other three systems , toward j1717@xmath6337 , j1625@xmath6254 , and j1604@xmath6446 are newly detected in this work .",
    "the spectra of the four sources are shown in figures [ fig1]-[fig4 ] , and each object is described in detail below .",
    "* j1717@xmath6337 * is known to exhibit galactic hi absorption ( @xcite ) , although molecular absorption has never been reported .",
    "we detect the ten species shown in table @xmath22 , including relatively rare species such as hn@xmath0c and hcs@xmath1 , all of which are new detections in this system .",
    "in addition , four hco(1@xmath231@xmath24 ) and six c@xmath25h(10 ) hyperfine structure lines are clearly detected .",
    "four velocity components are identified distinctly , as shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "further discussions of the nature of each molecule detected toward j1717@xmath6337 and of the @xmath26c/@xmath0c isotope ratio will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( ando et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "* j1625@xmath6254 * has not been investigated in terms of galactic absorption , except for a previous search for high-@xmath2 molecular absorption ( @xcite ) , with non - detection being reported in terms of this line - of - sight .",
    "hence , all four species reported in this work are new detections . further ,",
    "hco and h@xmath0co@xmath1 are not detected , which is significantly different to the profile of j1717@xmath6337 .",
    "only one velocity component is identified , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "* j1604@xmath6446 * has never been referred to in previous studies .",
    "thus , this is a new galactic molecular absorption system .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , absorption lines indicating two co transitions are detected , with the weaker line corresponding to cs(21 ) .",
    "two velocity components are identified in the co(21 ) spectrum , while only the @xmath27 km / s component is confirmed in that of co(32 ) . using a rotation diagram with the two transition lines , the @xmath3 of the main co component",
    "is calculated to be 6.2 k. however , this analysis assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and an optically - thin limit , which should be treated carefully in the case of co lines with moderate optical depths .",
    "* nrao530 * is an extensively - studied galactic molecular absorption system ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but its hco absorption lines are newly detected ( see section 4 ) .",
    "a single velocity component is identified , the velocity of which ( @xmath28 km / s ) is consistent with the values reported in previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    446 spectra .",
    "the blue solid and red dotted lines represent the co(21 ) and co(32 ) spectra , respectively.,width=302 ]",
    "among the various species detected in this study , hco is the most noteworthy .",
    "although its emission has been investigated in hii region interfaces ( @xcite ) and in the nearby starburst galaxies , m82 ( @xcite ) and ngc253 ( @xcite ) , hco absorption in diffuse media has only been reported along the lines - of - sight toward two bright quasars ( bl lac and 3c111 ) and toward the w49 galactic hii region ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the hco absorptions toward j1717@xmath6337 and nrao530 are the fourth and fifth detections , and this work almost doubles the number of hco absorption samples in diffuse media .",
    "the detection of hco absorption itself is quite rare , but it has certain implications .",
    "the hco in diffuse ism can be used as a pdr tracer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , because of the diffuse media environment .",
    "although there is a moderate density ( @xmath29 @xmath30 ) of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath25 ) gas in a diffuse medium ( @xcite ) , such a medium is expected to be illuminated by far - uv ( fuv ) radiation from distant ob stars ( @xcite ) . in such conditions , carbon ionized by fuv radiation",
    "should be present , as it has been suggested that ionized carbon ( c@xmath1 ) is the main carbon reservoir in neutral diffuse ism ( @xcite ) . in a diffuse medium , therefore , it is probable that hco is formed in the gas phase , through the reaction @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ch@xmath25 is formed from c@xmath1 and h@xmath25 through several reactions ( @xcite ) , and such chemistry is realized in the environment where c@xmath1 and h@xmath25 coexist . such an environment is comparable to that of classical pdrs , i.e. , interface regions between hii regions and molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "hii regions are directly illuminated by uv radiation , and molecular clouds are dense neutral regions shielded from such radiation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath18(hco)/@xmath18(h@xmath0co@xmath1 ) column density ratio can be used as a diagnostic of the presence of an fuv radiation field , and its high ratio ( @xmath32 ) suggests the presence of ongoing fuv photochemistry ( @xcite ) . although h@xmath0co@xmath1 is known to be sensitive to high - density gas ( @xmath33 @xmath30 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , taking the h@xmath0co@xmath1 to hco column density ratio is rather useful in accurately estimating the relative abundance of hco , because their close proximity in frequency ( h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hco at 86.671 and 86.754 ghz ) allows us to observe them simultaneously ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the hco and h@xmath0co@xmath1 column densities toward the two calibrators , compared with the values measured on the lines - of - sight of the sources toward which hco absorption was previously detected ( @xcite ) , along with the values in several pdrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath18(hco)/@xmath18(h@xmath0co@xmath1 ) ratios recorded toward j1717@xmath6337 and nrao530 are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , which are comparable to the values for well - known pdrs ( @xcite ) ; this suggests that the media observed toward these sources are in pdr - like environments .    in terms of the heating mechanisms of diffuse ism",
    ", a molecular absorption study has suggested that the gas - phase chemistry of some diffuse media is driven by turbulent dissipation ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , observations of the [ cii ] fine structure line ( @xcite ) and pure - rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen ( @xcite ) have demonstrated the role of fuv photons in diffuse media , as it is expected that uv radiation from distant ob stars can penetrate and illuminate diffuse ism ( @xcite ) . however , there are a limited number of studies that constitutes observational evidences that fuv photons drive pdr - like chemistry in diffuse molecular gas .",
    "this is primarily because , in diffuse ism , minor molecular species including pdr - tracers cause only minimal emission as a result of their low densities and low excitation states .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that hco enhancement comparable to that of pdrs , which suggests a pdr - like environment , is found in diffuse ism .",
    "importantly , this result observationally illustrates the role of fuv photons in triggering the pdr - like chemistry , and is expected to help us to further understand the heating mechanisms of such media .",
    "more detailed investigation into the chemistry and physics of pdr - like diffuse ism will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( ando et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , along with the data on the molecular absorption of higher transition lines , the observation of which is planned in alma cycle 3 .",
    "as three galactic molecular absorption systems are newly detected in this study , the use of alma calibrators as potential sources in the quest for molecular absorption systems is proposed .",
    "moreover , the detection of hco absorption also proves the power of alma : just a few minutes integration with alma almost doubles the number of hco absorption samples in diffuse media , and provides observational support for the pdr - like chemistry of diffuse ism processed by fuv radiation .",
    "alma follow - up observations of the molecular absorption systems that are likely to be discovered through alma - calibrator - based searches will constitute not only an efficient manner of investigating the chemical state of galactic diffuse ism , but also the best shortcut to extensive comprehension of the detailed nature of ism as a whole , from our galaxy to the high-@xmath2 universe .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for insightful comments , which helped us to improve the paper .",

    "the joint alma observatory is operated by eso , naoj and nrao .",
    "table [ tab5 ] lists the 36 calibrator sources analyzed in this work , and shows the observation projects that contain these sources and the bands and frequency ranges analyzed in this study , and indicates whether or not absorption lines are detected .",
