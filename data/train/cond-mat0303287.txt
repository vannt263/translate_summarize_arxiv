    "superconductivity ( sc ) and ferromagnetism ( fm ) are generally believed to be two mutually antagonistic orders . however , many interesting consequences like coexistence of triplet sc with fm , formation of a spontaneous vortex phase @xcite , spatially inhomogeneous fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov type superconducting order @xcite , etc . can arise if such a coexistence occurs .",
    "thus , the observation of sc ( with a high superconducting transition temperature t@xmath5 @xmath4 46k ) coexisting with fm ( with the magnetic transition temperature t@xmath6 @xmath4 132k ) in the hybrid rutheno - cuprate gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite has motivated intense activity to characterize the families of compounds @xcite lnsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 and ln@xmath7ce@xmath2sr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath8 ( ln = sm , eu , gd ) , and to study the nature of superconductivity , magnetism and their inter - relation .",
    "gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 is isostructural with the well known yba@xmath0cu@xmath9o@xmath10 with y and ba being completely replaced by gd and sr respectively , and the cuo chain replaced by ruo@xmath0 planes . while the current broad understanding of the system is that sc originates in the cuo@xmath0 planes and fm in the ruo@xmath0 planes , details of the nature of both sc and magnetism require further understanding .",
    "gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 has a very low h@xmath11 ( @xmath12 @xmath4100 oe ) and the superconducting properties are highly dependent on the details of sample preparation .",
    "rietveld refinement of the x - ray diffraction pattern of gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 showed @xcite that oxygen annealing leads to variation of the cation composition without change in the oxygen content .",
    "the formal charge of cu , which is less than the optimal value ( for the occurrence of sc ) for the as - prepared sample , increases upon prolonged annealing @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that the purity of the starting materials and the heating schedules play a crucial role in the structure and microstructure of the final product @xcite , thereby rationalizing contradictory reports @xcite of existence and non - existence of sc in this compound .",
    "the neutron diffraction studies @xcite suggest that the magnetic order in gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 is predominantly g - type antiferromagntic alignment of the ru moments with a low temperature moment @xmath41 mb along c axis .",
    "however , the magnetization studies @xcite show a spontaneous magnetization ms @xmath40.1 mb ( per ru ) .",
    "these two results can be reconciled if the ru moments are canted to give a net magnetic moment in a direction perpendicular to the c axis .",
    "neutron diffraction study @xcite of the related compound ysr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 showed a spontaneous magnetic moment @xmath40.28 mb ( which could be enhanced by applying an external magnetic field ) perpendicular to the c axis .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite of the magnetization data suggests i - type ordering consistent with a band structure calculation @xcite , but inconsistent with the neutron diffraction studies .",
    "further , the magnetism will also be affected by the valence of ru .",
    "the formal valence of ru has been taken to be 5 + in most of the previous rietveld analyses .",
    "recent nmr @xcite and xanes @xcite studies indicate mixed valence for ru with 40% ru@xmath13 and 60% ru@xmath14 in gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this also entails several possibilities @xcite for the magnetic order in this compound .",
    "thus , the precise nature of magnetic order in this compound still remains controversial and needs to be explored .",
    "the effect of substitution on the physical properties of this system is also very interesting and has been reported in literature @xcite .",
    "sn doping @xcite suppresses t@xmath6 from 138k for x = 0 to 78k for x = 0.4 in gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2sn@xmath15cu@xmath0o@xmath1 and t@xmath5 increases from 36k at x = 0 to 48k at x = 0.2 but falls thereafter . on the other hand",
    "even a small fraction of zn ( for cu ) rapidly reduces t@xmath5 and superconductivity is completely suppressed for the 3% substituted sample @xcite . motivated by above considerations",
    ", we have undertaken a study of tuning of the superconducting and magnetic properties by cu doping for ru in gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 . in this",
    "regard , and in continuation of our previous work @xcite , we have prepared gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 ( x = 0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 ) and investigated their properties , which are presented below .",
    "the compounds have been synthesized by the high temperature solid state reaction technique , which is commonly employed for the synthesis of high temperature superconductors .",
    "stoichiometric quantities of gd@xmath0o@xmath9 , srco@xmath9 , cuo and ru powder , all @xmath16 99.99% pure , have been mixed and ground . the mixture ( in the form of powder )",
    "is heated at 600@xmath17c for 48 hours to avoid ruo@xmath0 volatility and then at 950@xmath17c , in air , for 24 hours .",
    "it is then compressed into pellets and then heated at 1000@xmath17c in air for 72 hours . repeated grinding and heating at 1000@xmath17c in air is necessary to obtain phase pure samples .",
    "a final step involving annealing at 1060@xmath17c in oxygen for 96 hours is necessary to obtain the desired superconducting characteristics .",
    "high resolution x - ray powder diffraction analysis is carried out using a stoe powder diffractometer in the step scanning mode .",
    "electrical resistivity ( four probe method , 4.2 - 300k ) and ac susceptibility ( 4.2 - 300k ) have been carried out using home - assembled equipments .",
    "magnetization studies have been performed using a quantum design squid magnetometer ( 5k-300k ) .",
    "all the samples have been prepared in two batches to test for reproducibility .",
    "figure 1a shows the xrd of gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "phase analysis by xrd indicates that the impurity phase content is @xmath12 5% .",
    "the xrd pattern has been analyzed on the basis of the reported tetragonal structure with space group p4/mmm , and lattice constants have been found to be a=3.83@xmath18 and c=11.58@xmath18 which are in close agreement with the values reported in the literature @xcite . from the analysis of several other samples of gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "it is estimated that the detectability limit of the impurity phases like srruo@xmath9 and gdsr@xmath0ruo@xmath19 type phases and cuo by xrd is @xmath12 1% .",
    "the crystallite sizes of the sample are small @xmath4500 - 1000@xmath18 as calculated from xrd line widths using the scherrer formula .",
    "figure 2 shows the resistance ( r ) vs temperature ( t ) curve of gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 .",
    "this plot clearly indicates the occurrence of superconductivity in these samples , with t@xmath5 onset of 26.5k and zero resistance at around 6.4k for the stoichiometric composition gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the broadness of the transition may be due to the small crystallite size .",
    "figure 3 shows the ac susceptibility , @xmath20 , of gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 as a function of temperature .",
    "this figure shows peaks corresponding to the magnetic ordering of the samples with the peak occurring at 139.2k for the stoichiometric composition gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the relatively small value of the signal indicates the weak nature of ferromagnetism of the material . on closer examination of the r vs t plot ,",
    "the magnetic ordering transition can be seen as a change in slope at @xmath4139.2k .",
    "the diamagnetic shift corresponding to the superconducting transition at 26.5k is not observed in the susceptibility data for the stoichiometric composition gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( figure 3 ) below 26.5k . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath20 increases with decrease in t below 26.5k ( figure 3 ) . the steep increase in @xmath20 at low temperature arises due to the paramagnetic contribution of the gd moments which order antiferromagneticaly at 2.5k .",
    "it is believed that the superconductivity is weak and is also perhaps not homogeneous with the result that the magnetic signal due to the paramagnetic contribution of the gd moments overwhelms the diamagnetic superconducting signal . in order to confirm ferromagnetism in gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "isothermal magnetization studies have been carried out as a function of field at t=5k .",
    "figure 4a presents the m - h plot for gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 along with an inset indicating the low field part of the hysteresis loop .the shape of the m - h curve ( fig .",
    "4a ) is characteristic of fm and shows weak hysteresis with a low coercive field of @xmath4200 oe ( fig .",
    "4a inset ) .",
    "the magnetization studies at high fields indicate a saturation magnetization of 7 mb corresponding to ordering of gd moments in high field .",
    ". 1 b , c and d show the xrd patterns of compounds gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 ( x = 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 ) .",
    "the samples with x = 0.05 , x=0.1 and x=0.2 have impurity phase content approximately @xmath12 2% , @xmath12 1% and @xmath12 3% , respectively .",
    "all these compositions have the tetragonal structure with space group p4/mmm , isostructural with the stoichiometric composition .",
    "the lattice parameters of the compounds gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 ( x = 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , ) are almost identical , a @xmath4 3.83 @xmath18 and c @xmath4 11.57 @xmath18 and do not differ significantly from the stoichiometric gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistance for gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 ( x = 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 ) along with that of the x=0 sample .",
    "all of them exhibit superconductivity with zero resistance .",
    "the onset and zero resistance temperatures are ( 26.5 , 6.4 ) , ( 39.5 , 12.6 ) , ( 47.2 , 28.3 ) and ( 40.0 , 16.8)k respectively for x = 0 , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "one of the most important observations is that by cu doping t@xmath5 can be increased and x=0.1 appears to be the optimum cu doping concentration .",
    "it is also to be noted that these compounds are metallic over most of the temperature range down to 100k .",
    "below 100k there is a semiconducting - like upturn just above the transition to superconducting state .",
    "this may be due to the effect of granularity or magnetic scattering .",
    "further experiments in a magnetic field would clarify this and are in progress .",
    "however it is interesting to note that the sample x=0.1 , which shows the highest t@xmath5 , also has the minimum semiconducting upturn .",
    "the ac susceptibility vs temperature plots for gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1 ( x=0 , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.2 ) are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it may be noted that the undoped composition did not show a diamagnetic signal corresponding to superconductivity , whereas all the cu substituted compositions show signature of superconductivity in the ac susceptibility measurements as well .",
    "this may be due to an increase in grain size and/or homogeneity .",
    "the ferromagnetic transitions are also observed in the cu doped samples ( figure 3 ) but at a significantly lower temperature ( the magnetic transition temperature t@xmath6 being 135.8k , 129.9k and 123.2k respectively for x = 0.05 , 0.1 and x=0.2 ) as compared to 139.2k for the stoichiometric gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "figure 4b shows the isothermal magnetization hysteresis at 5 , 30 and 80k for a typical cu doped sample with composition gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath1 .",
    "this confirms the presence of weak ferromagnetism in the cu doped samples similar to the stoichiometric gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "as gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath1 had the highest t@xmath5 and also happens to have the highest purity ( @xmath12 1% impurity phase content ) more detailed measurements have been carried out on it .",
    "zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) measurements of ac susceptibility yielded identical results .",
    "5 shows the field cooled ac susceptibility in different measuring fields ( amplitude = 0.25 , 0.125 and 0.0625 oe ) for gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath1 .",
    "the ac @xmath20 starts to decrease at t@xmath438k indicating the onset of superconductivity . a significant change in slope of @xmath20 vs t",
    "is observed at t@xmath6 @xmath423k below the superconducting transition .",
    "this is perhaps an evidence of the transition from a bulk meissner state to a spontaneous vortex state similar to that observed by bernhard et .",
    "al.22 in dc @xmath20 measurements . a smaller amplitude of the measuring field results in a stronger diamagnetic signal ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the incomplete shielding effect is due to the low value of the lower critical field h@xmath11 that has been reduced by impurity scattering or small grain size .",
    "the dc magnetization studies on gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath1 as a function of temperature under different applied fields are presented in fig .",
    "the magnetization shows a tendency to decrease at t@xmath438k .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the onset ( of superconducting transition ) t@xmath5 measured by ac @xmath20 .",
    "however at lower temperature magnetization starts increasing and goes through a maximum in the zfc measurements and increases monotonically in the fc measurements .",
    "the increase may be due to the paramagnetic contribution of gd moments .",
    "the magnetization curves can be reconciled with as an additive effect due to the contributions to the signal of diamagnetism related to superconductivity and the paramagnetic response of the gd@xmath23 ions .",
    "in conclusion , gdsr@xmath0ru@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath1(x = 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 ) exhibits superconducting and ferromagnetic transitions , which can be tuned by cu doping for ru .",
    "t@xmath5 is increased by partial substitution of ru by cu .",
    "a doping level of 0.1 gives a maximum t@xmath5 amongst the investigated compositions .",
    "partial substitution of ru by cu also has the effect of decreasing the magnetic ordering temperature , from 139.2k for the undoped composition to 123.2k for 0.2 cu doped composition .",
