    "perhaps one of the most remarkable discoveries in astronomy over the last two decades is that supermassive black holes ( mass greater than @xmath6 ) exist in the nuclei of virtually all galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "supermassive black holes grow by accreting gas from the centers of their galaxies , which are observed as active galactic nuclei ( agn , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the growth rates of supermassive black holes and galaxies over cosmic time , traced by black hole accretion density and star formation density respectively , follow a strikingly similar pattern for the last @xmath7 billion years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a tight relation exists between the masses of central supermassive black holes and various properties of their galactic bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such empirical evidence clearly indicates a co - evolution between galaxies and their supermassive black holes .",
    "an important theoretical connection between agn and galaxies is inferred from the comparison between models of galaxy formation and observed galaxy properties .",
    "the observed stellar mass function of galaxies , which traces the distribution of galaxies by stellar mass , shows a sharp cutoff at the high mass end relative to the dark matter halo mass function . without some kind of feedback mechanism(s ) releasing energy into the galaxy in the theoretical models , strong gas cooling in massive , luminous galaxies would lead to more galaxies being formed at the high mass / high luminosity end of the luminosity function than are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the current successful models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) invoke agn as the primary source of feedback in massive galaxies , in order to inject energy into the interstellar medium , regulate or quench star formation , and slow black hole growth .",
    "a key process for agn feedback is agn - driven outflows , in which the agn produces a high - velocity wind that heats or sweeps up gas and drives them into the interstellar medium over distances comparable to the size of the galaxy , leading to the regulation and/or quenching of star formation .",
    "although these models successfully produce the observed galaxy stellar mass function , they must be verified with observations .",
    "therefore , it is a critical area of on - going research to observe and characterize agn - driven outflows .",
    "it is now evident that agn - driven outflows are fairly common in the local universe ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "ionized outflows have long been known to manifest themselves in a blueshifted wing in the emission lines of agn spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the prevalence of these outflows are revealed by large spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . using @xmath9 agn ( @xmath10 } \\sim 10^{40 } - 10^{44}\\mathrm{~erg~s}^{-1}$ ] ) from sdss ,",

    "the fiber spectroscopy provided by sdss does not allow for measurements of the physical extent of the outflows , which can be determined by follow - up integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) observations .",
    "using ifs , the physical extent of the outflows in very luminous agn ( @xmath10 } \\gtrsim 10^{42}\\mathrm{~erg~s}^{-1}$ ] ) are shown to be @xmath14 6 to 19 kpc , comparable to the size of the host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies show that galaxy - wide ionized outflows are relatively common among the most luminous agn in the local universe .    however , the crucial epoch to observe agn - driven outflows is @xmath15 , when the universe was only a quarter of its current age .",
    "the cosmic black hole accretion and star formation densities both reach a maximum at @xmath15 , before gradually declining by about a factor of 10 to the present - day values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "not only are agn - driven outflows expected to be more prevalent at this epoch of peak black hole accretion activity , their relation to the subsequent decline of cosmic star formation density is of particular interest in understanding the role of agn feedback in the regulation and quenching of star formation .",
    "therefore , it is a key cosmic time to observe and characterize agn - driven outflows and investigate their impact on their host galaxies .",
    "observations of agn - driven outflows at this epoch of peak activity level in the universe remain limited .",
    "many of the studies in the existing literature at @xmath15 are focused on small samples of extreme sources .",
    "some early results include @xcite , which finds outflows in three powerful radio - loud agn in very massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite finds energetic galaxy - wide outflows in a sample of 8 @xmath15 agn - hosting ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which are galaxies with elevated star formation activity .",
    "powerful outflows have also been found in a study of 10 @xmath16 luminous quasars @xcite , which are the most luminous members of the agn population ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these studies consist of special subclasses of agn , which are not representative of the much larger agn population . in order to investigate",
    "how agn feedback affects galaxy evolution in the wider picture , a study using a more complete sample of agn is necessary .",

    "the largest sample at @xmath0 to date is from @xcite , where the h@xmath3  and [ nii ] line profiles are used to find signs of outflows in the nuclear region ( radius @xmath23 2.5 kpc ) of 34 out of 110 star - forming galaxies at @xmath24 , 18 of which are confirmed agn ( @xmath25 ) . with outflow velocities of 300 to 1300 km",
    "s@xmath4 , the estimated mass outflow rates ( though very uncertain ) are comparable to the star formation rates ( sfr ) of the host galaxies , suggesting the outflows may be capable of ejecting sufficient gas to quench star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "it is important to test these results with a larger and more representative sample of agn at @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , to better constrain and characterize the kinematics of the outflows , it is important to have simultaneous measurement of h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath3  and [ nii ] ; [ oiii ] is especially useful , as it is unlikely affected by any potential agn broad line emission .",
    "the commissioning of the mosfire multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the 10-meter keck i telescope provides great opportunities to systematically study agn - driven outflows at high redshift .",
    "it is now possible to simultaneously obtain rest - frame optical spectra for a large number of sources at high redshift . in this study , we make use of data from the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey @xcite , a recently - completed four year near - infrared spectroscopic survey using mosfire . with mosdef , we have obtained rest - frame optical spectra of @xmath27 galaxies in @xmath28 , including more than 100 agn .",
    "these rest - frame optical spectra cover important emission lines for characterising agn and agn - driven outflows , including h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath3  and [ nii ] .",
    "the spectroscopic targets in the survey are selected to a fixed h - band magnitude , roughly corresponding to a threshold in stellar mass .",
    "these selection criteria result in a more representative sample of galaxies that is not biased towards high sfrs .",

    "this provides us with a large sample consisting of more typical agn in more representative galaxies , allowing us to investigate the effects of agn - driven outflows in the general agn population .    in this paper",

    "a total of 713 targets were observed , 555 of which yielded a reliable redshift . with the complete mosdef survey ,",

    "data were obtained for three masks in two additional candels fields , goods - s and uds , because our primary target fields were not visible during a portion of a few of the observed nights .",
    "all of the mosdef targets are covered by the 3d-_hst _ survey @xcite .",
    "full technical details of the design and observations of the mosdef survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "mosdef targets are selected within three redshift intervals , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such that the brightest rest - frame optical emission lines lie within atmospheric windows .",
    "this allows coverage of the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath3  and [ nii ] emission lines in the lower and middle redshift intervals , and h@xmath2  and [ oiii ] in the higher redshift interval .",
    "targets are prioritized according to weights determined by their h - band ( f160w ) magnitudes and redshifts in the 3d-_hst _ catalogs @xcite , with emphasis given to brighter galaxies and galaxies within the middle redshift interval ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "targets are selected down to limiting h - band magnitudes of 24.0 , 24.5 and 25.0 for the lower , middle and higher redshift intervals , respectively .",
    "we assign higher targeting priority to galaxies that are known to host agn , identified in advance by x - ray emission and/or red irac colors .",
    "in addition , agn are identified in the mosdef spectra using rest - frame optical diagnostics .",
    "the identification of agn in the mosdef survey is described below ; full details are discussed in @xcite .",
    "x - ray agn were identified prior to the mosdef slitmasks design using deep _",
    "chandra _ x - ray imaging in the survey fields .",
    "the depth of the _ chandra _ data used is 160 ks in cosmos , 2 ms in goods - n , 4 ms in goods - s and 800 ks in aegis .",
    "these correspond to hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) flux limits of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath39 , respectively .    the x - ray data from all the fields were reduced and analyzed according to the prescription in ( * ? ? ? * see also @xcite ) .",
    "for point source detection , a false probability threshold of @xmath40 was adopted .",
    "each source must be detected in at least one of the four bands : soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , hard ( 2 - 7 kev ) , ultrahard ( 4 - 7 kev ) and full ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) .",
    "then the x - ray sources were matched to sources detected at irac , nir and optical wavelengths using the likelihood ratio method ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to identify secure multiwavelength counterparts .",
    "( see @xcite for details . )",
    "the resulting catalogs were then matched to the closest source within @xmath41 in the 3d-_hst _",
    "catalogs used for mosdef target selection .",
    "these x - ray sources were given higher priority in mosdef target selection .",
    "for the x - ray sources observed by mosdef and for which a redshift was determined , the 2 - 10 kev rest - frame x - ray luminosity was estimated from the hard or soft band fluxes .",
    "luminosity estimates assume a simple power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath42 and galactic absorption only .",
    "our hard band detection threshold approximately corresponds to an x - ray luminosity limit of @xmath43 across the four fields .",
    "the luminosity estimates should be reasonable since at the mosdef redshift range ( @xmath44 ) , a relatively large absorption column density ( @xmath45 ) is required to significantly suppress the observed flux , even in the soft band . of the 28 x - ray agn observed in the first two years of the mosdef survey with a secure derived redshift ,",
    "22 are detected in the hard band , with @xmath46 spanning @xmath47 .",
    "all 28 x - ray agn are included in this study .",
    "although deep x - ray surveys are a highly reliable means of selecting agn , x - ray photons can be significantly absorbed at high column densities ( e.g. @xmath45 ) , weakening their efficiency in identifying heavily obscured agn .",
    "the mir wavelengths can potentially be used to identify such agn , as high - energy photons from the agn are absorbed and re - radiated by dust at the mir wavelengths .",
    "it is common to use the unique mir colors of agn to identify infrared agn ( ir agn ) using irac data from _",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for mosdef",
    ", we make use of the irac color criteria from @xcite to select ir agn .",
    "these criteria were designed to limit contamination from star forming galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath48 ) , resulting in a pure agn sample , and were used by @xcite for the mosdef survey .",
    "we use irac fluxes reported in the 3d-_hst _ catalogs @xcite , and select ir agn following the @xcite criteria in irac color - color space : @xmath49 conditions [ eq : pl1 ] , [ eq : pl2 ] and [ eq : pl3 ] are slightly relaxed to include sources satisfying these conditions within 1@xmath50 uncertainties of their irac fluxes .",
    "condition [ eq : relax ] is also relaxed to include one source falling marginally outside this condition but satisfying all the others and having colors far from any star - forming galaxies in the mosdef sample .",
    "27 ir agn are selected in the data from the first two years of mosdef in this way ; 9 of these ir agn are also identified through x - ray imaging as described in section [ x - ray ] .",
    "apart from the 46 x - ray and/or ir agn identified prior to target selection as described in sections [ x - ray ] and [ ir ] , we additionally identify agn optically using emission line ratios derived from the mosdef rest - frame optical spectra . for the 555 mosdef sources from the first two years that have a reliable redshift , as described in @xcite , we simultaneously fit the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath3  emission lines using a @xmath51-minimization method by the ` mpfit ` @xcite routine in ` idl ` .",
    "we fit the spectra with a continuum near the emission lines with zero slope and a maximum of three gaussian components for each line :    1 .   a gaussian function with fwhm @xmath23 2000 km s@xmath4 , one each for the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath3  emission lines , representing the narrow - line emission from the agn and/or host galaxy ; 2 .   a broad gaussian function with fwhm @xmath13 2000 km s@xmath4 , one each for h@xmath2  and h@xmath3  only , representing the broad line emission from the agn ; 3 .   an additional gaussian function with fwhm @xmath23 2000 km s@xmath4  and a velocity offset between @xmath52 and 0 km s@xmath4 , one each for the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath3  emission lines , representing a potential blueshifted outflow component .",
    "the fwhm of each gaussian function is set to be equal for all of the lines of interest .",
    "the flux ratios between [ oiii]@xmath53 and [ oiii]@xmath54 and between [ nii]@xmath55 and [ nii]@xmath56 are fixed at 1:3 for each gaussian function .",
    "we determine the minimum width of the gaussian functions by randomly selecting unblended sky lines in different wavelength intervals and fitting them with a single gaussian function . from the average width of the sky lines ,",
    "we determine a minimum width ( gaussian sigma ) in observed wavelength of 2.5  for h@xmath2   and [ oiii ] and 3.5  for h@xmath3  and [ nii ] .",
    "we first perform fits and evaluate the @xmath51 with a model consisting of the narrow - line component ( component 1 ) alone , then only accept additional components when the resulting decrease in @xmath51 implies a @xmath57-value of @xmath58 for the simpler model .    based on the results from the emission line fits , we use the diagnostic bpt diagram @xcite to identify optical agn in the mosdef sample . for this diagnostic",
    "we sum the non - broad component fluxes of the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath3  emission lines , applying balmer absorption corrections to the h@xmath2  and h@xmath3  fluxes .",
    "sources above the @xcite demarcation line in the bpt diagram are selected as optical agn for the purposes of this study , as at low redshift sources above this line are considered likely to have an agn contribution to their optical spectra . at high redshifts ,",

    "* ) . in the mosdef survey ,",
    "this offset is observed only for galaxies in the lower stellar mass half of the sample ( @xmath59 ) @xcite , while most of the agn identified in the mosdef have stellar masses of @xmath60 .",
    "previous mosdef agn papers @xcite used the @xcite demarcation line in the bpt digram to identify optical agn , as it balances contamination by star - forming galaxies and completeness of the agn sample in our survey . in this study ,",
    "the aim is to select sources with at least some agn contribution instead of pure agn , as the presence of any agn activity may suffice to drive an outflow and provide feedback .",
    "therefore , an agn sample as complete as possible is preferred , even if it has some contamination .",
    "the use of the @xcite line instead of the @xcite line results in nine additional sources being identified as potential agn .",

    "by definition in our detection algorithm , all of the outflow components have a velocity centroid that is blueshifted relative to the narrow - line component ( though the outflow may have some emission that is redshifted relative to the narrow - line emission , e.g. , cosmos 10421 ) .",

    "however , no difference is observed between ir agn and non - ir agn .",
    "therefore , we can not establish a significant relation between the incidence of outflows and the dust content of the galaxy or near the agn , which may be expected if radiation pressure on dust grains is a key component of the physical driving mechanism of these winds .",
    "we note that ir agn in mosdef are found to reside in host galaxies which are less dusty on the whole , although there may be more dust in the vicinity of the agn to allow for ir detection .",

    "the full mosdef sample will provide better statistics to further investigate these questions .          to understand the drivers of these outflows and their potential impact on the evolution of their host galaxies , it is crucial to estimate the mass and energy carried by the outflows .",
    "unfortunately , deriving accurate estimates of the mass and energy of the outflows can be challenging as it requires precise knowledge of the outflow geometry and kinematics , as well as the properties of the interstellar medium and the physical state of the gas in the outflow .",

    "another possibility has been raised , which is that agn feedback may instead _ trigger _ star formation ; this is referred to as `` positive '' feedback , as it leads to an enhancement in star formation .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , at high redshift it has been observed that the axis of radio agn jets was often aligned with an elongation in the surface density of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "indeed , for the well - studied source known as minkowski s object , the gas that appears to be compressed by the jet does have line ratios in the bpt diagram in the location of the star - forming sequence , well below the agn region of the diagram @xcite .",
    "this argues that the jet has induced star formation in this gas .    in the mosdef sample , we present the locations of outflowing gas from eight sources in the right panel of figure [ fig : bpt ] and find that the locations lie in the agn region ; this outflowing gas does not appear to be photoionized by star formation .",

    "<S> using observations from the first two years of the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey , we study 13 agn - driven outflows detected from a sample of 67 x - ray , ir and/or optically selected agn at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the agn in the sample have bolometric luminosities spanning @xmath1 , including both quasars and more common , moderate - luminosity agn . </S>",
    "<S> we detect signatures of blueshifted , ionized gas outflows in the h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath3  and/or [ nii ] emission lines of 19% of the agn , while only 1.8% of the mosdef galaxies have similar outflows detected . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow velocities range from 300 to 1000 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> eight of the 13 detected outflows are spatially extended on similar scales as the host galaxies , with spatial extents of 2.5 to 11.0 kpc along the mosfire slits . </S>",
    "<S> outflows are detected uniformly across the galaxy star - forming main sequence , showing little trend with the stellar mass or sfr of the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> line ratio diagnostics in the bpt diagram indicate that the outflowing gas is photoionized by the agn . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find evidence for positive agn feedback , either in our relatively small mosdef sample or in a much larger sample from sdss . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the mass and energy outflow rates in the mosdef agn indicates that stellar feedback is likely insufficient to drive these outflows at @xmath0 and that they are very likely to be agn - driven . </S>",
    "<S> the outflows have mass - loading factors of @xmath5 , suggesting that they help regulate star formation in their host galaxies , though they may not be sufficient to fully quench it . </S>"
