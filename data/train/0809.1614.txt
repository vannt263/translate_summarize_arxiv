    "the normal form theory uses canonical changes of variables to transform a map into a simpler one called a normal form .",
    "usually the normal form is more symmetric than the original map and ( at least in the setup of the current paper ) is integrable .",
    "classical normal forms are not always unique and their further reduction has been studied by various methods in order to derive unique normal forms  @xcite .",
    "our approach uses a grading function in order to simplify manipulations with formal series in several variables . unlike @xcite",
    "our grading functions are mostly non - linear .    in this paper",
    "we derive the unique normal forms for area - preserving maps at a generic elliptic resonant fixed point .",
    "the symmetry of the normal form is induced by the jacobian matrix of the map and strongly depends on the type of the fixed point .",

    "let @xmath2 be an area - preserving map with a fixed point at the origin @xmath3since @xmath4 is area - preserving @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we can denote the two eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these eigenvalues are often called _ multipliers _ of the fixed point .",
    "a fixed point is called    * _ hyperbolic _ if @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; * _ elliptic _ if @xmath11 ( in this case @xmath12 ) ; * _ parabolic _ if @xmath13 .",

    "hyperbolic fixed point . * from the viewpoint of the normal form theory this case is exceptional since the map can be transformed into its birkhoff normal form by an analytic change of variables .",
    "indeed , moser @xcite proved that there is a canonical ( _ i.e. , _ area- and orientation - preserving ) analytical change of variables such that in a neighbourhood of the origin @xmath15 takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 v_{1}=\\displaystyle\\frac{v}{a(uv ) } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath18 is an analytic function of a single variable @xmath19 .",
