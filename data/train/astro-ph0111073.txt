    "the acceleration of the fast solar wind is a long - standing problem in solar physics .",
    "it is likely that alfvn waves play a significant role in this process ( e.g. leer et al .",
    ". they can propagate over long distance , which allows them to reach the outer corona , because to lowest order they are incompressible and do not dissipate .",
    "however dissipative damping is required at some point to avoid too high wind velocities ( e.g. holzer et al .",
    "a closer examination shows though that a linearly polarized alfvn wave is compressible to second order , since the magnetic pressure , @xmath0 , varies with half the wave length of the alfvn wave itself ( alfvn & flthammar 1963 ) . in a circularly polarized alfvn wave , on the other hand , the magnetic pressure is constant along the wave , which is the physical reason why the circularly polarized alfvn wave in a homogeneous medium is an exact solution to the nonlinear mhd equations .",
    "several groups have studied different mechanism through which alfvn waves can dissipate . in two dimensions phase mixing due to a transverse gradient in the phase velocity ( e.g. heyvaerts & prist 1983 ) can lead to a strong damping of the wave .",
    "this mechanism is not available in one dimension though , and one has then rather considered the nonlinear coupling of the alfvn wave with other modes ( e.g. wentzel ( 1973 ) , for circularly polarized alfvn waves in particular see also del zanna et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "cohen & kulsrud ( 1974 ) found in an approximate solution of the nonlinear mhd equations that the linearly polarized alfvn wave steepens and can form current sheets .",
    "this result has later been confirmed by numerical simulations by boynton & torkelsson ( 1996 ) and ofman & davila ( 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we use the numerical code of boynton & torkelsson ( 1996 ) ( see also torkelsson & boynton ( 1998 ) ) to simulate propagating circularly polarized alfvn waves . in the following",
    "we will consider both models with a constant background density , and stratified models .",
    "for all the simulations the temperature is @xmath1 k and the period of the waves is 300 s. the isothermal speed of sound is @xmath2 ms@xmath3 .",
    "= 13.0 cm      for the unstratified models , we differentiate between two cases , when the magnetic field is weak , that is @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and when it is strong that is @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for both the runs @xmath8kgm@xmath9 .",
    "we compare the runs in fig .",
    "1 . if we compare our fig 1a to fig .",
    "1 of boynton & torkelsson ( 1996 ) we notice that in both cases there is an acoustic precursor moving at a speed close to @xmath10 , but in their case the precursor is a sinusoidal oscillation in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "apparently the gradual increase of the magnetic pressure at the front of the linearly polarized alfvn wave drives an oscillatory wave , while the sharp discontinuity of the magnetic pressure at the front of the circularly polarized wave works as a piston .",
    "the amplitude of the acoustic precursor in fig . 1a scales with the square of the amplitude of the alfvn wave .    when @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "1c and 1d ) a density enhancement propagates with the wave . @xmath12 and @xmath11 are then related by @xmath14 . while the right edge of the enhancement coincides with the front of the alfvn wave , the left edge propagates with the velocity @xmath15 . in the leftmost part of fig .",
    "1c we see the effect of the non - linear interaction between the acoustic wave and the alfvn wave .",
    "boynton & torkelsson ( 1996 ) found that when @xmath16 approaches @xmath17 in strength , the alfvn wave starts to steepen into current sheets ( fig .",
    "2a ) which enhance the dissipation of the wave",
    ". the circularly polarized alfvn wave does not develop such current sheets ( fig .",
    "= 6.0 cm      we discus in this paper two models : one with @xmath18 and one with @xmath19 , both have a background magnetic field @xmath20 t.    at the bottom of the grid @xmath21 is smaller than @xmath15 and equal to @xmath22 ms@xmath3 , but it increases with @xmath23 and eventually becomes higher than @xmath15 . density is taken to be equal to @xmath24kgm@xmath9 at the bottom of the corona and varies with @xmath23 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 m is the scale height at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the solar radius .",
    "the wave front of the alfvn wave pushes matter upwards forming a density perturbation which behaves as an acoustic precursor as long as @xmath21 is smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath21 becomes larger than @xmath15 the alfvn wave begins to overtake the precursor , which however persists and propagates forward with a speed close to the speed of sound ( fig .",
    "3a ) . for a low amplitude alfvn wave",
    "the density enhancement almost keeps its shape as it propagates while for a high amplitude wave the density enhancement changes gradually .",
    "= 8.8 cm    in fig .",
    "3c we see a decrease in the poynting flux in front the acoustic precursor .",
    "4 shows the time average over one alfvn wave period of the poynting flux and the integrated work it does via the lorentz force . in the linearly polarized case",
    "the wave loses @xmath29 of its poynting flux below @xmath30 r@xmath31 and very little of it is dissipated after that ( see boynton & torkelsson ( 1996 ) fig .",
    "9 ) while in the circularly polarized case the wave loses very little of its poynting flux below @xmath32 , but it has lost almost half of it at @xmath33 r@xmath31 by doing mechanical work on the plasma .",
    "in constructing models of alfvn wave driven stellar winds it is important to understand the mechanism by which the alfvn waves are damped .",
    "a linearly polarized alfvn wave of high amplitude can steepen and form current sheets even in a homogeneous medium , which leads to a quick damping of the wave .",
    "while a circularly polarized alfvn wave does not dissipate its energy in a homogeneous medium , we have found that it may do so in a stratified medium .",
    "the dissipation sets in later than for a linearly polarized alfvn wave though , but a significant fraction of its poynting flux may still be spent on doing work on the medium through which the alfvn wave propagates ."
