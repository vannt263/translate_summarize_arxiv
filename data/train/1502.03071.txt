    "differential geometry plays a fundamental role together with a wide range of some analytical tools which arise from geometry . in this metric approach",
    ", the models of the universe are then classified in accordance with the features of the curvature tensor .    in newtonian cosmology , the equation that describes the evolution of the universe",
    "is obtained from the equation of motion and the energy equation for particles ( galaxies ) subject to gravitational forces and considering the cosmological principle as well @xcite .",
    "this suggests that we can use the formalism developed by lagrange and hamilton , writing down the lagrangian and hamiltonian of the system in order to obtain the equation and integral of motion .",
    "the newtonian cosmology , a model of the universe based on newtonian mechanics , was well established in the third decade of last century @xcite . in this context , the cosmological equations which describe the time evolution of the universe obtained by considering the cosmological principle , assuming that the pressure is zero and using newtonian dynamics and gravitation .",
    "the results obtained in this case show that the universe could not be static , obeying an equation which algebraically is similar to friedmann s equation of general relativity , but obviously has different interpretation .",
    "this model based on newtonian treatment provides a good description of the expanding universe in which pressure is zero @xcite .",
    "when pressure is taken into account it is necessary to modify the basic equations of the pressureless case @xcite and adopt some assumptions @xcite in order to garantee the analogy between the newtonian and einsteinian approaches .",
    "it is worth call attention to the fact that to obtain the equivalence between newtonian and einsteinian cosmologies it is necessary to combine the equations of classical mechanics and the cosmological principle which nowdays is strongly supported by the smooth cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) whose spectrum is isotropic and uniform to @xcite within @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the fact that this anisotropy agrees very well with that of the initially homogeneous and isotropic universe indicates that the cosmological principle should be valid at least over length scales much bigger than hundreds of megaparsecs .",
    "quantum newtonian cosmology is the theoretical framework within which it is possible to find the wave function which predicts the behavior of the newtonian universe .",

    "the heun functions have a wide range of applications in physics , from quantum mechanics to cosmology @xcite and the number of articles using their solutions have been growing , even in a scenario in which the theory concerning these functions is not yet completed .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian operator for the newtonian universe . in section 3 , we solve the schrdinger equation in this background .",
    "we present the biconfluent heun equation , and then we obtain the heun polynomials in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum for a particle ( galaxy ) moving in a newtonian universe . in section 6",
    ", we write the general and exact expression of the wave function .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we present our conclusions .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , using some assumptions about the structure of the newtonian universe , we obtained the lagrangian , @xmath1 , for the motion of a particle ( galaxy ) of mass @xmath2 , which is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cosmological constant , and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangeana ] ) corresponds to a kind of cosmological potential energy . using this lagrangian , the equation for the scale parameter , @xmath5 ,",
    "can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the sphere ( total mass of the newtonian universe ) .",
    "it is worth call attention to the fact that we are considering the case @xmath8 , that is , a universe in which the pressure is zero .    the lagrangian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangeana ] ) does not depend explicitly on time , because the system is under the action of a uniform force field , so that the constant of motion , @xmath9 , called classical hamiltonian of the system , can be defined as @xmath10 from eq .",

    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltoniano ] ) we can write the classical hamiltonian as @xmath15    now , we can construct a phase space as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the comoving coordinate with @xmath18 being the linear momentum .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , the classical hamiltonian takes the form @xmath19 therefore , performing the canonical quantization @xmath20 we obtain the hamiltonian operator for a particle ( galaxy ) moving in the newtonian universe , which is given by @xmath21",
