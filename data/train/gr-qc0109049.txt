    "in contrast , the bound obtained here is very straightforward and involves few assumptions , making it less prone to error : the chief assumption that we have made is the form of the effective mass term for the graviton , which  while not unique  is natural .",
    "furthermore , any other mass term would be expected from dimensional arguments to yield similar results .",
    "we have assumed that only measurement errors enter into the determination of the intrinsic binary period decay rate @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , the determination of this rate requires an estimate of the acceleration of the binary system , which is principally toward the galactic center @xcite .",

    "the large uncertainty in the discrepancy @xmath86 associated with psr  b1534 + 12 may well be due to an underestimate of the distance to this binary system @xcite , in which case the bound on @xmath93 would be even tighter .",
    "the bound described here arises from the properties of dynamical relativity , making it conceptually independent of either the solar system or galactic cluster bounds on the graviton mass , which are based on the yukawa form of the static field in a massive theory .",
    "furthermore , we expect improvement in the bounds from any given pulsar system as observations improve the accuracy of the measured fractional discrepancy in the period derivative . for example , when the observations of psr  b1534 + 12 improve limits on @xmath86 to the same level as is observed today for psr  b1913 + 16 , the corresponding single - system bound on the graviton mass should improve to approximately @xmath106 .",
