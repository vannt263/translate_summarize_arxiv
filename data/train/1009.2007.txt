    "notice that , perhaps unlike bohr s own , this interpretation concerns _ all _ classical contexts , leading to a weaker notion of binary complementarity than usual . to avoid clashes with the various existing terminologies and their connotations , and to emphasize the distinction between talking about _ two _ ( totally ) incompatible classical contexts ( as bohr typically did ) , and mentioning all of them",

    "completely complementary_. this paper considers instances of this interpretation of complementarity with regard to three aspects of quantum mechanics .    1 .   the observables of a quantum system form a von neumann algebra .",
    "in this setting , complete complementarity is customarily taken to mean that one has to look at all commutative von neumann subalgebras  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the states of a quantum system are unit vectors in a hilbert space , which can be coordinatized by choosing any orthonormal basis . here",
    ", complete complementarity may be interpreted as saying that it takes measurements in all possible orthonormal bases ( of many identical copies of a system ) to determine its state perfectly  @xcite , as in state tomography  @xcite .",
    "3 .   the measurable properties of a quantum system form an orthomodular lattice .",
    "complete complementarity translates to this view as stating that the lattice structure is determined by all boolean sublattices  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will take a more general perspective , as all three layers , separately , have recently been studied categorically .    1 .",
    "the set of commutative von neumann subalgebras of a von neumann algebra gives rise to a topos of set - valued functors , whose intuitionistic internal logic sheds light on the the original noncommutative algebra in so far as complete complementarity is concerned  @xcite .",
    "the category of hilbert spaces can be abstracted to a dagger monoidal category , in which much of quantum mechanics can still be formulated  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "orthonormal bases are characterized as so - called classical structures  @xcite .",
    "orthomodular lattices can be obtained as kernel subobjects in a so - called dagger kernel category  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we will take the view that of these three layers , ( ii ) is the primitive one , which the others derive from .",
    "indeed , our main results are in categories that are simultaneously dagger monoidal categories and dagger kernel categories .",
    "we give definitions of partial and complete complementarity for ( i ) commutative von neumann subalgebras , ( ii ) classical structures , and ( iii ) boolean sublattices of the orthomodular lattice of kernels . by developing a point - free notion of copyability",
    ", we obtain a bijective correspondence between partially complementary classical structures and partially complementary boolean sublattices .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this seems to be the first positive use of tensor products in the study of orthomodular lattices  the relation between tensor products and orthomodular lattices has resisted attempts at structural understanding so far , and only negative , restrictive , results are known .",
    "our second main contribution is to characterize categorically what partially complementary commutative von neumann subalgebras correspond to in terms of classical structures in the category of hilbert spaces , conceptually improving upon previous work in this setting  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : sections [ sec : classicalstructures ] , [ sec : orthomodular ] and [ sec : vonneumannalgebras ] study layers ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( i ) respectively .",
