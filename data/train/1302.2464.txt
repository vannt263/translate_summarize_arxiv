    "electric dipoles interact through their electromagnetic fields .",
    "hence , the propagation and scattering properties of these fields in the medium where the dipoles are embedded , strongly influence the spatial dependence of dipole - dipole interactions . in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ,",
    "these interactions are described as being mediated by virtual photons in different field modes .",
    "the space dependence is then determined by the spatial wavefunction of the field modes and hence on the geometry .",
    "when one of the dipoles is initially excited , the resulting interaction induced by virtual photons is the so - called resonant dipole - dipole interaction ( rddi ) , where the excitation is dynamically exchanged between the two identical dipoles @xcite . in free space , where the photon modes are plane waves , rddi scales as @xmath1 for inter - dipolar distances @xmath2 , much shorter then the typical dipolar - transition wavelength @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "studies of other geometries however , where rddi is mediated by confined photon modes , e.g. one dimensional surface plasmon polaritons @xcite , photonic band gaps @xcite , cavity modes @xcite and hollow metallic waveguides @xcite to name a few , yielded rather different space - dependencies .",
    "for example , in a rectangular hollow metallic waveguide ( mwg ) , depicted in fig .",
    "1 , long range rddi at distances of @xmath6 was found possible , by exploiting the existence of cutoffs in the photon spectrum @xcite . for modes with cutoff frequencies higher than @xmath7 , the interaction",
    "is mediated by evanescent modes , i.e. decaying exponents , that sum up to give the free - space result @xmath1 at distances much shorter than the size of the waveguide confinement ( @xmath0 and @xmath8 in fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "consider now the van der waals ( vdw ) dispersion interaction , namely when both dipoles are in their ground states , and their mutual interaction is mediated by virtual photons from the vacuum . in free space and for short distances",
    "w.r.t the dipole wavelength , @xmath9 , the vdw interaction scales as @xmath10 , a direct consequence of the quasistatic limit of the rddi , @xmath1 .",
    "however , at longer distances , @xmath5 , in the so - called retarded regime , casimir and polder obtained a @xmath11 dependence @xcite .",
    "different spatial scalings were found however , when two interacting bulk objects rather than point dipoles were considered .",
    "casimir studied the case of two parallel metal plates and found an attraction force that scales as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the distance between the plates @xcite .",
    "since then , related effects are constantly being studied , mainly considering the interaction between dielectric or metallic objects of various geometries @xcite .",
    "such experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies demonstrate the role of retardation and geometry dependence of these vdw - related phenomena @xcite .    here",
    "however , we would like to take a somewhat different point of view towards the spatial - dependence of the dispersion interaction , reminiscent of that we described for rddi .",
    "namely , instead of considering objects with different geometries and calculate their interaction energy , we refer back to the original vdw configuration of a pair of point dipoles while changing the geometry of their surrounding environment , and hence the structure of the mediating virtual photon modes .",
    "specifically , here we study dispersion interactions between two dipoles inside a metallic waveguide , in the case where the typical dipole wavelength @xmath3 is much larger than the typical transverse confinement of the waveguide ( @xmath0 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "our results , obtained analytically by qed perturbation theory , are analogous to those of rddi in a mwg @xcite .",
    "they are rather general although full expressions are then derived for the case of a rectangular mwg .",
    "since the smallest cutoff frequency for the mediating transverse modes of the waveguide is of order @xmath14 , they become evanescent for the dipole frequency @xmath15 . indeed",
    ", we obtain the dispersion energy as a sum of decaying exponentials , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the inter - dipolar distance on the propagation axis of the mwg , @xmath18 is an index of a transverse mode , and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "two distinct regimes are than recognized : the retarded , wave - like , limit , at long distances @xmath20 , where the interaction decays like @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the smallest of all the @xmath23 s , and the vdw , short - distance limit at @xmath24 , where the free - space result @xmath10 is restored .",
    "hence , as opposed to the free - space case , where @xmath3 sets the scale for retarded ( casimir - polder ) and non - retarded ( vdw ) regimes , here we find that the relevant scale is @xmath0 .",
    "two consequences then emerge : _ ( 1 ) _ unlike free - space , retardation effects are dominant here at distances set by @xmath0 , much shorter than the wavelength @xmath3 , and _ ( 2 ) _ the interaction has a range much shorter than in free - space due to the exponential decay in the retarded regime .",
    "the latter also suggests that the approximate additivity of dipole - dipole and dispersion interactions in a dilute system of many interacting dipoles @xcite , is expected to hold here at even higher densities .",
    "another interesting aspect of our results is related to the character of the dominant transverse modes in the casimir - polder and vdw regimes . whereas , the smallest cutoff frequency is obtained for the lowest order transverse - electric ( te ) mode and",
    "hence it is dominant in the retarded limit , the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes are dominant in the short - distance limit and their contributions sum up to give the familiar free - space result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide a general discussion and formalism for the calculation of the dispersion energy mediated by photon modes that posses a cutoff , and introduce the modes of the mwg .",
    "next , in section iii , we present the calculation and results for the dispersion energy in a mwg , whereas the comparison with free - space in the corresponding vdw ( short - range ) and casimir ( retarded ) regimes is analyzed in section iv .",
    "our conclusions are finally given in section v.",
    "we consider two identical dipoles , e.g. made of atoms or molecules , with ground state @xmath25 and a ladder of excited levels @xmath26 with corresponding energies @xmath27 w.r.t that of the ground state .",
    "the excited levels possess dipole - transition matrix elements @xmath28 to the ground state .",
    "the dipoles are placed inside a hollow waveguide that supports photon modes with normalized mode functions , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the wavenumber at the propagation axis @xmath17 with quantization length @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the index of the polarization and @xmath33 and @xmath18 are indices of the transverse mode whose dependence on the transverse coordinates is described by @xmath34 . each of the transverse modes @xmath35 has a dispersion relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the speed of light in the material that fills the hollow waveguide and @xmath38 is the cutoff frequency of this mode .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two dipoles @xmath39 and the field modes is then described by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dipole coupling between the @xmath42 transition of atom @xmath43 located at @xmath44 , and the @xmath45 mode with lowering operator @xmath46 , and @xmath47 being the permittivity inside the mwg .      in order to calculate the dispersion interaction energy we follow the qed perturbative approach of ref .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath48 is obtained as the fourth order correction to the energy of the ground state of the system , @xmath49 with energy @xmath50 , where both atoms are in their ground state and the photon modes are in the vacuum @xmath51 , @xmath52 here @xmath53 are intermediate ( virtual ) states , and @xmath54 is the free hamiltonian ( @xmath55 ) energy of the state @xmath56 .",
    "the above sum contains 12 possible terms , each of which describes a different virtual process and can be represented by a diagram . in fig .",
    "2 we present the diagrams of two of these processes : the one in ( a ) includes the intermediate states @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , whereas the one in ( b ) describes the process @xmath60 and @xmath58 .        it is easy to show that all 12 terms in the sum ( [ e4 ] ) have the same numerator , but are distinct in their denominators . for example , the terms that correspond to the diagrams in figs . 2(a ) and 2(b ) possess the denominators , @xmath61 respectively .",
    "let us now consider the case where the wavelengths associated with all the dipolar transitions , @xmath63 are much larger than the transverse confinement of the waveguide , @xmath0 and @xmath8 . since the cutoff wavenumbers of the transverse modes , @xmath64 , result from the confinement , they must satisfy @xmath65 or @xmath66 @xmath67 , and we obtain in our case @xmath68 for all states @xmath69 and modes @xmath35 . then , considering also the dispersion relation , eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , we find @xmath70 this means that @xmath71 such that the contribution of diagram ( b ) is negligible w.r.t that of diagram ( a ) from fig .",
    "2 . in fact",
    ", there are three more diagrams with denominator @xmath72 and in a similar fashion one can show that @xmath72 is smaller than the rest of the possible denominators of the remaining 7 diagrams , out of the total 12 .",
    "hence , the dispersion energy in the tight - confinement case can be approximated by considering only the contribution of the diagrams with @xmath72 .",
    "namely , we obtain the energy @xmath48 by 4 times the contribution of diagram ( a ) , @xmath73 here @xmath17 is the inter - dipolar distance in the waveguide propagation axis @xmath17 , whereas ( @xmath74 ) is the transverse position of dipole @xmath75 . the indices @xmath76 run over the projections of the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath77 onto the @xmath78 directions , e.g. @xmath79 .",
    "further simplification can be made by applying the inequality ( [ con ] ) in the above expression for @xmath80 , obtaining @xmath81 eq . ( [ u ] ) shows that the spatial dependence of the dispersion energy @xmath48 is encoded in @xmath80 , while eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) further simplifies its calculation by the fourier transform of a multiplication of the waveguide modes transverse profiles .",
    "we consider the rectangular hollow mwg shown in fig . 1 , whereas any of our calculations can be easily generalized to e.g. a circular hollow mwg .",
    "we also take the limit of a perfect metal , which is reasonable when the relevant frequencies @xmath82 , @xmath14 and @xmath83 are small enough w.r.t the plasma frequency of the metal .",

    "( [ u ] ) and ( [ f ] ) , for all dipole orientations @xmath95 and mode polarizations @xmath89 .",

    "the exponential decay is a consequence of interaction via evanescent modes , since all of the frequencies of the dipole transitions @xmath82 , were assumed here to be lower than all the cutoff frequencies of the mwg , @xmath38 ( see sec .",

    "we proceed in a similar fashion for the rest of the options and find @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath100 .      by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ emn ] ) we note that @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) is independent of @xmath30 , such that it can be taken out of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) for @xmath113 .",

    "this integral is found to be equal to @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the zeroth order modified bessel function and where the lowest order approximation due to the tight confinement , @xmath119 , was taken .",
    "we thus obtain for any @xmath112 and @xmath120 , @xmath121",
    "after we obtained the general expression for the dispersion energy for every polarization of the dipoles and mediated by any of the transverse modes @xmath35 , we now wish to consider two relevant limits ; i.e. , the retarded , casimir - polder limit , and the quasistatic , vdw limit , and compare the results with their free - space counterparts .      in the tight confinement case we consider ,",
    "the scale for the on - axis distance @xmath17 at which wave effects emerge is set by the confinement @xmath123 .",
    "however , since @xmath124 , wave effects in the confined case mean decay rather than oscillation with @xmath17 due to the evanescent nature of the modes .",
    "( [ tmzz]),([tmxx ] ) and ( [ tm ] ) show that for any dipole orientation , the tm - mediated energy decays exponentially with the exponent @xmath64 like , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is assumed here for simplicity .",
    "clearly , when @xmath20 , the contribution of the lowest order tm mode , namely @xmath127 and @xmath128 , overwhelms that of the rest of the tm modes , and the @xmath129 contribution to the sum for @xmath130 in eq .",

    "the ratio between the mwg and free - space results becomes , @xmath159 while the factor @xmath160 may become larger than @xmath149 , since @xmath17 is between @xmath0 and @xmath161 , the exponential decay still makes this ratio much smaller than @xmath149 , such that the free - space energy is much stronger than the one mediated by the mwg in this @xmath17 limit .",

    "( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) imply that the dispersion interaction in a mwg is much shorter ranged than that in free space .",
    "this is further discussed in the conclusions in section v.      we define the vdw regime as the range of inter - dipolar distance @xmath17 where wave effects are not significant .",
    "this is the case for @xmath169 , where the dipoles are close enough such that the exponential decay of the te and tm evanescent waves , set by @xmath0 and @xmath8 , is almost not felt .",
    "moreover , when the dipoles are placed in the center of the waveguide and are close enough such that they do not `` sense '' its metallic plates , free - space behavior is expected to be observed .",
    "the @xmath102 terms [ eqs .",
    "( [ tmzz]),([tmxx ] ) and ( [ tm ] ) ] possess an exponential decay @xmath170 , which in the @xmath169 is slowly decaying with @xmath33 and @xmath18 . hence , unlike the retarded regime , where only the @xmath92 was considered , here we must consider all terms if we wish to account for arbitrary small @xmath17 . in sec .",
    "ivb3 below , we show how the summation over all the terms may yield the free - space result .",
    "the @xmath17-dependence of the te modes [ eq . ( [ te ] ) ] , goes like @xmath171 .",
    "it is obvious that for small enough @xmath33 and @xmath18 and in the limit @xmath169 discussed here , we have @xmath172 . in order to make our discussion clearer ,",

    "let us now try to estimate the total contribution of the te modes : as @xmath177 , the contribution of each @xmath178 diverges like @xmath179 .",
    "summing them together , we multiply @xmath179 by roughly @xmath180 terms , ending up with @xmath181 divergence . if we wish to account for any , arbitrary small @xmath137 , then @xmath182 such that our estimation in fact includes the contribution of all terms .",
    "to conclude , we estimate @xmath183 using this result in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , we obtain that the vdw energy mediated by solely te modes scales as @xmath184 .",
    "such divergence is much weaker then that of free - space , @xmath185 , which we expect to obtain when the dipoles are very close .",
    "this implies , that the contribution of the te modes to the dispersion energy at short distances is not the dominant ingredient of the total energy in this regime .",
    "the above conclusion drawn for the te modes contribution for the dispersion energy suggests that the tm modes are the dominant interaction mediators in the vdw , short - range , regime .",
    "we now reside to the calculation of the vdw energy due to tm modes . in order to also relate it to its free - space counterpart , we assume that the dipoles are in the center , namely @xmath150 and @xmath186 , and take @xmath142 for simplicity . then , for the @xmath96 component [ eq .",

    "we conclude that in the vdw regime , namely @xmath24 , where no wave effects are apparent , and when the dipoles are in the center of the waveguide , the tm modes are dominant and the dispersion energy is that of free - space , as can be expected .",
    "in this paper , we applied ideas drawn from the modification of resonant dipole - dipole interaction in confined geometries , to the study of dispersion interactions between a pair of point - like dipoles .",
    "we considered a tightly confined waveguide structure whose transverse - modes cutoff - frequencies are all above the typical frequency of the interacting dipoles .",
    "we obtained analytical expressions for the dispersion energy at all inter - dipolar distances @xmath17 .",
    "we found that the difference between retarded , wave - like ( casimir - polder ) , behavior and quasistatic ( vdw ) one , is set by the confinement length - scale @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath24 the interaction is mediated by tm modes and can become identical to its free - space counterpart , whereas in the retarded regime , @xmath20 , the interaction is exponentially decaying with distance and is carried by @xmath93 and @xmath94 evanescent fields . hence , the resulting interaction is much shorter range than that in free space .",
    "this has an implication on the non - additivity of the vdw and dipole - dipole interactions : in free - space the interaction energy between multiple dipoles is additive , namely , can be obtained by pairwise summation , as long as @xmath206 is small , where @xmath207 and @xmath2 are typical polarizability and inter - dipolar distance respectively @xcite . here",
    "however , this @xmath1 scaling is expected to change such that even for higher densities , @xmath208 , the interaction may still be additive .",
    "this entails modifications of , e.g. the effective dielectric constant of a gas of such dipoles , and all casimir - associated phenomena in a mwg environment , which are based on the retardation and non - additivity @xcite , that are both being altered here .",
    "finally , let us address the generality of our results .",
    "although they were explicitly derived for a rectangular hollow mwg , the same dependence on distance @xmath17 is expected for dispersion interactions mediated by any transverse modes with cutoff frequencies higher than that of the dipole transition .",
    "these may include , e.g. other cylindrical hollow mwg in various transverse shapes , tightly confined hollow - core fibers and high - order modes of electric transmission lines .",

    "it is worth mentioning however , that even without considering bulk objects and new geometries , a repulsive force , that scales like @xmath209 , was also found when the interaction between an electron in an atomic rydberg level and the ion of the same atom was considered , see e.g. , j. f. babb and l. spruch , phys .",

    "<S> we consider the dispersion energy of a pair of dipoles embedded in a metallic waveguide with transverse dimension @xmath0 smaller than the characteristic dipolar wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 sets the scale that separates retarded , casimir - polder - like , from quasistatic , van der waals - like , interactions . </S>",
    "<S> whereas in the retarded regime , the energy decays exponentially with inter - dipolar distance , typical of evanescent waves , in the van der waals regime , the known free - space result is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this short - range scaling implies that the additivity of the dispersion interactions inside a waveguide extends to denser media , along with modifications to related casimir effects in such structures . </S>"
