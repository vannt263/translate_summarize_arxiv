    "let smooth planar curves @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 be given . draw the tangent line to @xmath0 through any point @xmath3 on this curve , and",
    "let it meet @xmath1 in a point @xmath4 and @xmath2 in a point @xmath5 .",
    "let the tangent lines to the respective curves through these points meet in a point @xmath6 . when the point @xmath3 moves along @xmath0 , the point @xmath6 draws a new curve @xmath7 . thus , a local mapping on the set of planar curves is defined , @xmath8 which will be referred to as the _ tangential map_. the word `` local '' means that , first , the mapping is defined not for all triples of curves since the tangent to the curve @xmath0 may not intersect @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and therefore only such curves or parts of the curves are considered where the construction is possible ; second , the mapping may be multivalued since there may be several intersections , in this case a fixed branch of the mapping is considered .",
    "some properties of the tangential map are studied in this paper .",
    "it turns out to be rather simply related to the factorization of differential operators . in its turn",
    ", this allows to establish the relation with such integrable equations as semidiscrete ( @xmath9 ) toda lattice and , under a reduction , hirota equation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "one of modifications of discrete kp equation ( @xmath11 ) appears in the discrete version of the tangential map .",
    "thus , the tangential mapping is not a quite new object , rather it is of certain interest as one more geometric interpretation of well - known integrable equations .",
    "the main property of the tangential map is 3d - consistency .",
    "this means that if one starts from the curves @xmath12 and constructs the curves @xmath13 then the curve @xmath14 constructed from the triple @xmath15 is one and the same for any permutation of @xmath16 .",
    "alternatively , this can be formulated as follows .",
    "[ th:3dcons ] the tangential map satisfies the ( local ) identity @xmath17    the proof is given in the next section . the combinatorial structure of identity ( [ 3dcons ] )",
    "is represented by assigning the arguments of the mapping ( the curves in our case ) to the vertices of a cube , and the mapping itself to the faces , as shown on .",
    "the @xmath18-fold iteration of the mapping is associated with an @xmath19-dimensional cube .",
    "the notion of 3d - consistency was formulated in @xcite in connection to the discrete integrable equations of the difference kdv type ( the fields in the vertices of the cube ) or to the yang - baxter type mappings ( the fields on the edges of the cube ) .",
    "both types of equations appear as nonlinear superposition principle for darboux - bcklund transformations and are two - dimensional : two discrete independent variables correspond to the shifts along the edges of an elementary square .",
    "in contrast , the case of the tangential map is related to a three - dimensional equation : in addition to the discrete variables a continuous one appears corresponding to a parameter along the curves .",
    "another important distinction is the asymmetry of the tangential map : the roles of the involved curves are obviously different . in particular , the formulas from the next section make clear that the construction of @xmath20 from @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is described by a differential rational mapping , while the construction , for instance , of @xmath22 from @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 requires an additional integration .",
    "this explains the choice of the set @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 as preferable initial data , rather that the sequence @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 , as it is usual in the standard formulation of yang - baxter mappings @xcite .        the simplest example illustrating the tangential map and its 3d - consistency property is given by the family of concentric circles ( see ) , or , in slightly more general form , by the family of logarithmic spirals defined by equations @xmath25 in polar coordinates .",
    "the fact that the tangential map does not lead out of these families is clear from the invariance of the construction with respect to the rotations and scalings .",
    "however , the concurrence of the last three tangents is not spontaneously obvious ( as an additional feature , in the case of family of circles , the points @xmath26 lie on the circle with @xmath27 as diameter , where @xmath28 is the center of the family ) . of course",
    ", this can be proved by elementary methods , but the point is that the concurrence of the tangents occurs in much more general situation . in it will be demonstrated that this example corresponds to the simplest case of the factorization of differential operators with constant coefficients",
    ". illustrates a nice property of the logarithmic spiral ( in contrast to the previous plot , this one contains only three generations of points @xmath29 , that is the triple intersections of the lines are not shown ) .",
    "this property can be formulated as the identity @xmath30 for any branch of the map @xmath31 .",
    "consider the intersection points of the logarithmic spiral with its tangent .",
    "the tangents through these points meet on the same spiral .",
    "let the curve @xmath0 be given in parametric form @xmath32 .",
    "then the point of intersection with the curve @xmath21 is given , in the affine coordinates , by an equation of the form @xmath33 with some coefficient @xmath34 ( here and further on the subscript @xmath35 marks the quantities associated with the edge @xmath36 of the combinatorial cube ) .",
    "this equation defines a parametrization of the curve @xmath21 .",
    "it plays the role of an auxiliary linear problem for one branch of the tangential map .",
    "the curve @xmath20 is defined from the compatibility condition @xmath37 where the coefficient @xmath38 correspond to the edge @xmath39 .    equating the coefficients for the linearly independent vectors",
    "@xmath40 yields the equations @xmath41 which can be solved as the differential mapping @xmath42 @xmath43 this is the formula which defines the action of the tangential map on the coefficients @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , one can use the first of equations ( [ aa ] ) in order to introduce the potential @xmath45 accordingly to the formula @xmath46 , then the second equation rewrites as the differential mapping @xmath47 , @xmath48 the property of 3d - consistency is formulated in terms of the variables @xmath44 as the commutativity of the operators @xmath49 which define the shift along the edges @xmath36 : @xmath50 and in terms of the variables @xmath45 as the identity of type ( [ 3dcons ] ) : @xmath51 both identities can be proved straightforwardly , although the computation is rather tedious .",
    "it can be avoided by the following argument .",
    "[ proof:3dcons ] the above compatibility condition is equivalent to the equality @xmath52 that is the definition of the tangential map amounts to the reconstruction of an ordinary second order differential operator from its kernel , under the condition of unitary constant term which is equivalent to affine normalization . consider the differential operator @xmath53 corresponding to one of three possible ways of computing @xmath54 . accordingly to ( [ fac2 ] ) , @xmath55 is divisible from the right not only by @xmath56 , but also by @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , two left factors of @xmath55 can be rewritten , again accordingly to ( [ fac2 ] ) , as @xmath58 , that is operator @xmath55 does not changes under permutation of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . but",
    "this means that it is divisible from the right by @xmath61 as well .",
    "therefore , the kernel of @xmath55 is invariant with respect to any permutation of indices .",
    "since a differential operator is uniquely defined by its kernel ( up to a scalar factor which is fixed here by the condition that the constant term is unitary ) , hence the operator @xmath55 itself is invariant with respect to the permutations .",
    "now it is clear that an @xmath18-fold tangential map corresponds to a differential operator of order @xmath18 divisible from the right by operators @xmath56 , @xmath62 .",
    "this immediately leads to the wronskian formula ( for each of two components of @xmath3 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "more simple mappings of type ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ ttv ] ) are obtained from the factorization of operators normalized by the condition of unitary leading term : @xmath65 which is equivalent to @xmath66 and brings to the maps @xmath67 and ( under the substitution @xmath68 ) @xmath69 the 3d - consistency of these maps is proved analogously .",
    "clearly , equations ( [ ta ] ) , ( [ ttv ] ) and ( [ ta ] ) , ( [ ttv ] ) are interpreted as 3-dimensional equations on @xmath70 , with the fields @xmath44 corresponding to the edges of the lattice and @xmath45 corresponding to the vertices .",
    "these equations are related via simple substitutions to the semidiscrete toda lattice , introduced in @xcite for the first time ( to the best of author s knowledge ) , see also @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to use the complex notation in this example , assuming @xmath71 ( the case @xmath72 correspond to the circle ) .",
    "then @xmath73 and these curves are homothetic to the original one if and only if the coefficients @xmath74 are constant .",
    "the action of the map ( [ ta ] ) on the constant coefficients is identical : @xmath75 , therefore the tangential map amounts to the rotational dilation @xmath76 which preserves the family of curves under consideration .",
    "the @xmath18-fold mapping is given by analogous explicit formula , so that this example can be considered trivial . however",
    ", even this example demonstrates that the established relation between the tangential map and differential operators is not one - to - one and depends on the choice of initial curve and its parametrization .",
    "the mappings corresponding to the same operators ( that is , with the same coefficients @xmath44 ) can be regarded as locally equivalent , but the global picture may be quite different .",
    "for example , the tangential map has four branches in the case of concentric circles ( real if the radius of @xmath0 is less than the radii of @xmath77 ) and infinite number of branches in the case of logarithmic spirals .    in order to obtain the auto - mapping shown on",
    ", one has to assume the additional constraint @xmath78 ( then @xmath79 , @xmath80 and so on ) , that is @xmath81 this implies that @xmath82 are roots of the transcendental equation @xmath83 and the coefficients @xmath74 are expressed by the formula @xmath84 it can be derived from here ( this is left to the reader as an easy exercise ) , that the boundary of the domain free of the lines on fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral ] is approximated by a parabola .",
    "the numeric values for this plot are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87      the previous example suggests that a picture with good global behavior of the curves can be obtained if the starting curve is the circle @xmath88 again , and the coefficients @xmath89 are almost constant functions with periods commensurable with @xmath90 . for instance , the left plot on corresponds to @xmath91 the right plot corresponds to the choice @xmath92 here the tangential map brings to the curve with cusps .",
    "we will say , slightly abusing the terminology , that a curve @xmath93 is a _",
    "loxodrome _ for a given curve @xmath0 if it intersects the tangents to @xmath0 under a constant angle @xmath94 ( in particular , if @xmath95 , then @xmath93 is an involute of @xmath0 ) .",
    "below demonstrates that the tangential map preserves this type of relation between the curves ( see ) . as a preliminary , it is convenient to introduce the parameter on the curve @xmath0 accordingly to equations @xmath96 where @xmath97 are unit tangent and normal vectors . obviously , the function @xmath98 is the radius of curvature and the relation to the natural parametrization by arc length @xmath99 is @xmath100 this choice of parametrization is explained by the fact that its form is preserved for the curve @xmath93 as well .",
    "indeed , the equation of a point on this curve is @xmath101 . then @xmath102 and since @xmath103 meets @xmath104 under the constant angle @xmath94 ( reckoned in the direction of the normal @xmath105 , for definiteness ) , hence @xmath106 in virtue of this constraint , the equalities @xmath107 hold , with @xmath108 thus",
    ", we have proved that the choice of @xmath109 as the parameter brings to equations of the type ( [ y ] ) for the loxodrome @xmath93 as well .",
    "if the function @xmath98 is given then the constraint ( [ ya ] ) is the determining equation for the coefficient @xmath44 , and the loxodrome is constructed by any solution of it .",
    "[ th : loxodrome ] let curves @xmath21 and @xmath22 meet tangents to a curve @xmath0 under constant angles @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively , and @xmath112 .",
    "then the curve @xmath13 meets tangents to @xmath21 under the angle @xmath111 and tangents to @xmath22 under the angle @xmath110 .",
    "assume the parametrization ( [ y ] ) for the curve @xmath0 .",
    "then , as it was shown before , the parameters @xmath74 of the tangential map and the functions @xmath113 for the loxodromes are related by @xmath114 it is easy to prove that in virtue of these constraints the tangential map ( [ ta ] ) takes the form @xmath115 and moreover , the identity @xmath116 holds , which is the constraint of the form ( [ ya ] ) for the functions @xmath117 and @xmath38 . but",
    "this means exactly that the curve @xmath20 is a loxodrome for @xmath22 , corresponding to the angle @xmath110 .",
    "formally , this statement looks like well - known bianchi theorem on the permutability of darboux - bcklund type transformations ( see ) .",
    "however , it is clear from the proof that in our case the situation is more simple : indeed , bcklund transformations amount to solving of riccati equations , while the construction of the loxodromes amounts , accordingly to ( [ ya ] ) , to a simple quadrature . the superposition principle for the transformations under consideration turns out to be linear : @xmath118 a genuine darboux transformation leading to the nonlinear superposition principle is provided by the reduction presented in the next example .",
    "let @xmath119 be the homothety with a coefficient @xmath120 with respect to a fixed point ( origin ) in the plane .",
    "we will say that the curves @xmath0 , @xmath93 are in the _ tangential correspondence _ with parameter @xmath94",
    "if the tangent to the curve @xmath0 through any point @xmath3 meets @xmath121 in the point @xmath122 , and the tangent to @xmath93 through @xmath103 meets @xmath123 in the point @xmath124 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : t - corr ] ) .        as in the example with the loxodromes",
    ", this notion defines some reduction of the tangential map which can be studied more conveniently in some special parametrization of the curves .",
    "the points on the curves @xmath0 , @xmath93 are related by equations of the form @xmath125 which imply that the vector - functions @xmath126 satisfy linear second order odes @xmath127 therefore , the ratio of the first and the last coefficients is the same for @xmath3 and @xmath103 , that is it is an invariant of the tangential correspondence . it is convenient to use such a parametrization that this ratio is constant",
    "let @xmath128 then the equations take the form @xmath129 where functions @xmath130 are related to the coefficient @xmath44 via the pair of riccati equations @xmath131 the first one is linearized by the substitution @xmath132 which brings to equation @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the curve @xmath93 is constructed by use of a particular scalar solution of the differential equation for the original curve @xmath0 , at the value of the parameter @xmath134 , that is the tangential correspondence is nothing but an example of darboux transformation .    let a curve @xmath0 be in the tangential correspondence with curves @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 respectively , and @xmath112 . then an unique curve @xmath20 exists which is in the tangential correspondence with the curves @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with the parameters @xmath111 , @xmath110 respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath135    it follows directly from the definitions of the tangential map and the tangential correspondence that if such a curve @xmath20 exists then it is unique and is given by the above formula .",
    "so we only need to verify that this curve is indeed in the tangential correspondence with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , by use of the relations @xmath136 it is easy to prove that the formula ( [ ta ] ) takes , in virtue of these constraints , the algebraic form @xmath137 and that the coefficient @xmath138 identically satisfies the riccati equation @xmath139 this means that the curves @xmath20 , @xmath22 are in tangential correspondence , with parameter @xmath110 .",
    "it should be noticed that equation ( [ rurr ] ) for @xmath3 defines the spectral problem for the @xmath140-gordon equation , mapping ( [ taf4 ] ) is equivalent to the mapping ( @xmath141 ) from @xcite , and the substitution @xmath46 , @xmath142 brings to the equation @xmath143 which is equivalent to the hirota equation @xcite .",
    "analogously , the mapping ( [ ta ] ) admits the similar reduction @xmath144 which brings to the mapping @xmath145 this is one of the forms of nonlinear superposition principle of darboux transformation for the shrdinger operator @xcite .",
    "let us consider discrete curves @xmath146 , then an analog of equation ( [ ri ] ) reads @xmath147 the compatibility condition of such equations @xmath148 brings to the relations @xmath149 which yield a discrete analog of tangential map ( [ ta ] ) : @xmath150 the substitution @xmath151 brings to an analog of map ( [ ttv ] ) : @xmath152 the symmetric form of this equation @xmath153 demonstrates that the shift @xmath154 is actually on the equal footing with @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "difference substitutions relate this equation to the discrete toda and kp equations ( in particular , the variable @xmath45 is identified as the wave function of the linear problem for kp equation @xcite ) .",
    "alternative geometric interpretations of these equations can be found in the papers @xcite , see also @xcite where a general theory of this class of equations is developed .",
    "the 3d - consistency property of the maps ( [ dta ] ) and ( [ dttv ] ) is formulated by the same general identities ( [ tta ] ) , ( [ tttv ] ) as in the continuous case , and is proved along the lines of the proof of . there exist also the simple geometric explanation of this property : the triangles @xmath157 and @xmath158 are perspective with respect to the line @xmath159 ( marked by @xmath160 on ) , therefore , accordingly to desargues theorem , the lines @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are concurrent , as required",
    ".          equation ( [ ri ] ) can be replaced by @xmath164 for the curves in a space of dimension greater or equal to @xmath165 . in the discrete case",
    "one has analogously @xmath166 it is not difficult to demonstrate that the compatibility condition @xmath167 is equivalent to a system of @xmath165 equations which can be solved in the form of differential or difference mapping @xmath168 with the derivatives or shifts up to @xmath169-th order .",
    "these mappings are 3d - consistent , which can be proved by arguments analogous to the case @xmath170 just considered .",
