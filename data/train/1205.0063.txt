    "we modeled the pca ( 322  kev ) and hexte ( 1880  kev ) spectra using isis ( v1.6.1 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "energies lower than 3  kev were ignored due to uncertainties in the background modeling and a systematic error of 0.5% was added in quadrature to the pca data in order to take the uncertainties in the response matrix into account . to improve the signal to noise in each channel , we grouped the pca and the hexte spectra to a minimum signal to noise of 5 above a lower bound of 3  kev and 18  kev , respectively .",
    "there exists no convincing theoretical model for the shape of the continuum x - ray spectrum in accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is generally modeled as a power law with high energy exponential cutoff .",
    "we first tried to fit the pca - hexte spectrum of mxb  0656@xmath0072 using a standard isis model cutoffpl , a power law with a high - energy exponential cutoff , @xmath24 where @xmath1 is the photons @xmath25 at 1  kev , @xmath26 is the power law photon index , and @xmath27 is the e - folding energy of exponential cutoff .",
    "another similar continuum model we tried is a power law with a high - energy rollover ( plcut ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was applied to mxb  0656 - 072 during the 2003 x - ray outburst by @xcite . the analytic form of the plcut model is @xmath28 where @xmath27 and @xmath29 are the cutoff and folding energies , respectively .",
    "each fit shows in the residuals a pseudo - p cygni profile near 10  kev , which has been reported by @xcite and found in other accreting x - ray pulsars ( her x-1 , gs 1843 + 00 ; * ? ? ?",
    "they concluded that the pattern of the residuals around 10  kev was due to the continuum model . in the plcut model ,",
    "the energy cutoff should be smoothed by including a gaussian absorption line with an energy dependent width at the continuum cutoff energy @xcite . here",
    "we choose to use cutoffpl with a low - energy absorption , as it is the simplest model , to fit the x - ray continuum emission for the spectrum of mxb  0656 - 072 .",
    "a normalization constant ( 1 for the pca data and a free parameter for the hexte data ) was added to the model to get a good agreement between these two instruments .",
    "a bad reduced chi - squared @xmath30 = 21.5 for 53 degrees of freedom ( dof ) was obtained and the residuals are shown in the panel ( b ) of figure  [ figure : fit ] . since the feature around 10  kev might not be real , we will not discuss its physical nature in this paper . in order to remove the systematic feature in the residuals at @xmath1910  kev , a gaussian absorption line ( gabs ) function ,",
    "@xmath31 was used in the model and improved the fit from a reduced chi - square of 21.5 for 53 dof to 8.9 for 50 dof , where @xmath32 is the optical depth , @xmath33 is the line width , and @xmath34 is the line energy .",
    "the other obvious feature in the panel ( b ) of figure  [ figure : fit ] should be an iron line at @xmath19 6.4  kev , which was described by the gaussian shaped model gaussian in isis . due to the lower energy resolution of pca ( less than 18% at 6  kev )",
    ", the width of the iron line in the model was fixed at 0  kev .",
    "after this feature was added in the model , a better reduced chi - squared of 1.23 for 48 dof was obtained .",
    "thus , the f - statistic is 156.7 and the f - test probability is about @xmath35 , which indicates that it is reasonable to add a gaussian component in the model .",
    "@xcite suggested that the f - test statistic can not be used to test for the presence of a line and they proposed a monte carlo simulation approach to calculate the approximate statistical significance .",
    "we followed this method to calibrate the sample distribution of the f - statistic for the spectrum of mxb  0656 - 072 .",
    "we simulated 10,000 spectra with isis from the null model ( a cutoff power law with the low - energy absorption and a gaussian absorption feature around 10  kev ) at its best - fit parameters .",
    "each faked data were grouped exactly as we did for the real data and fitted with the alternative model ( which included the gaussian line component ) .",
    "the f - statistic between the null and the alternative model was calculated and their distribution was shown in figure  [ figure : monte ] .",
    "the maximum value of the f - statistic from the 10,000 faked spectra is much less than the f - statistic value of 156.7 calculated from the real data .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the ion line around 6.4  kev was detected at the greater than 99.99% confidence level in the spectrum of mxb  0656 - 072 .",
    "we found a broad absorption feature around 30  kev in the residuals of the last fitting which showed in the panel ( c ) of figure  [ figure : fit ] .",
    "this feature should be the cyclotron resonance scattering feature around @xmath193040  kev reported by @xcite and it was modeled with the cyclabs function in isis , @xmath36 where , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the cyclotron energy , depth , and width , respectively @xcite . here , the cyclotron width @xmath39 was fixed at 10  kev in the model .",
    "a good reduced chi - square of 1.01 for 46 dof was obtained and the residuals were shown in the panel ( d ) of figure  [ figure : fit ] . with the same method as the iron line ,",

    "a 101.2 day period has been inferred from the _ rxte_/asm and _ swift_/bat lightcurves thanks to a series of x - ray outbursts which occurred between mjd  54350 and mjd  54850 .",
    "such a 101.2 day period was very likely the orbital period of mxb  0656@xmath0072 . the position of this 101.2 day period and its 160.4  s spin period in the corbet diagram support the be / x - ray binary nature of the system .",
    "mxb  0656@xmath0072 has similar orbital parameters as the be / x - ray binary a 0535 + 26 , which has a 111-day orbital period and a 103-s spin period , and they almost occupy the same position in the corbet diagram ( see figure  [ figure : corbet ] ) .",
    "the folded _",
    "rxte_/asm and _ swift_/bat light curves of mxb 0656@xmath0072 , with an orbital period of @xmath40  days , show a complex outburst profile ( see figure  [ figure : foldlc ] ) .",

    ", we can estimate the semi - major axis of the binary system with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the masses of the optical companion and neutron star , respectively .",
    "since mxb  0656@xmath0072 ( o9.7ve ) and a0535@xmath1726 ( o9.7iiie ) have similar optical counterparts , we adopt @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the compact object is fixed to @xmath46 , typical of a neutron star .",
    "these values yield @xmath47 .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission line is generally found to arise in a region about 10@xmath48 from the central be star @xcite . in order to capture material and",
    "cause an x - ray outburst , the neutron star should pass within this region at the periastron point .",
    "hence , the separation between the neutron star and the oe star at the periastron point should be smaller than the h@xmath1 emission region , given by @xmath49@xmath1910@xmath48 .",

    "the photometric observations showed that the @xmath2 magnitudes during our 2007 observations were about 0.2 mag larger with respect to those in our following observations ( see table  [ table : diffmag ] and figure  [ figure : uvb ] ) .",
    "spectroscopy of 2007 november 16 ( during the rising phase of the first x - ray outburst ) indicated that the h@xmath1 still had a very strong emission during the x - ray outburst .",
    "it is generally believed that the h@xmath1 emission line in be stars is formed in the entire circumstellar disk @xcite , while only the innermost part of the disk contributes significantly to the continuum flux . due to the higher ionization potential energy , the formation region of the hei  @xmath76678 line",
    "should be smaller than the nearby continuum region @xcite .",
    "the consistency among the variability of the brightness in the @xmath2 bands in mxb  0656@xmath0072 suggests that the changes of the optical continuum emission might be caused by the physical changes in the circumstellar disk around the oe star @xcite .",
    "the strong h@xmath1 emission corresponds to a more extended circumstellar disk , while the decrease of the optical brightness indicates the dilution of the inner disk .",
    "moreover , the increase of the hei  @xmath76678 emission in the 2007 observations should be connected with the formation of a denser inner disk .",
    "to explain all the observational phenomena , a unified physical model should be assumed in mxb  0656 - 072 .",
    "observational results @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite suggest that after an outburst a low - density region seems to develop around the be star . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the outburst might be connected with the increased mass loss or mass ejection from the be star . some weeks to months after the outburst , the stellar radiation pressure gradually excavates the inner part of the disk and a low - density region could develop around the be star and slowly grow outward @xcite . with the vacuation of the inner disk , the optical continuum emission decreases and an increase in @xmath2 magnitudes will be observed .",
    "after the outburst , material is transferred into the disk and a more extended circumstellar disk should be formed , which produces the stronger h@xmath1 emission from the system .",
    "therefore , we suggest that a mass ejection event had taken place in mxb  0656 - 072 before our 2007 observations and a low - density region was developing during that period .",
    "the hei  @xmath76678 became stronger when the optical continuum emission was decaying , which indicated that a larger quantity of material close to the stellar surface should be present when a low - density region was developing in the inner part of the disk .",
    "the new disk material might be ejected from the star by the subsequent mass ejection or reaccreted into the inner region after the supply of material from the star to the disk has been turned off @xcite .    with the expansion of the circumstellar disk after the outburst ,",
    "the outer part of the disk interacts with the neutron star around its periastron passage .",
    "a part of the material in the disk is accreted onto the neutron star and an x - ray outburst is triggered .",
    "this could explain the first x - ray outburst in 2007 which occurred in a decline phase of the optical brightness .",
    "a considerable fraction of the angular momentum would be transferred onto the neutron star in the system , which may account for the simultaneous spin - up detected by fermi / gamma - ray burst monitor during the last x - ray outburst in figure  [ figure : asmbatlc ] .",
    "a similar phenomenon was also observed in other be / x - ray binaries , such as 4u  1145 - 619 @xcite , a0535 + 26 @xcite and 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite .",
    "all these x - ray outbursts seem to take place in the decline phase of the optical emission .    during the first x - ray outburst in 2007 , the h@xmath1 emission kept nearly unchanged .",
    "the motion of the neutron star could not influence the size of the h@xmath1 emission region instantaneously . with the extension of the ejected material , the density in the outer region of the disk would increase and",
    "a much stronger peak flux was observed in the second and third x - ray outbursts ( see figure  [ figure : asmbatlc ] ) .",
    "the last x - ray outburst in 2008 occurred between mjd  54720 and mjd  54760 .",
    "our 2008 optical observations taken during the last x - ray outburst show that the h@xmath1 emission level and the @xmath2 brightness returned to their levels of 2006 .",
    "there were no more changes in h@xmath1 emission and the @xmath2 brightness between our 2008 and 2009 observations .",
    "however , no x - ray outburst has been observed since the last one in 2008,indicating that the material ejected in 2007 has been dispersed into the outer region of the system . the circumstellar disk in the equatorial region of oe star became denser and larger at the early stage of the mass ejection in the end of 2007 and a stronger h@xmath1 emission was observed during our 2007 observations . due to the gravitational effect of the neutron star , the size of the circumstellar disk could not increase continuously and it should have been truncated @xcite .",
    "the size of the truncated disk after the last x - ray outburst in 2008 should be smaller than the distance to the first lagrangian ( l1 ) point at periastron and the h@xmath1 emission was in a stable level after our 2008 observations .",
    "another large , extended type ii x - ray outburst was observed with _",
    "rxte _ in mxb  0656@xmath0072 from 2003 october to 2004 january @xcite .",
    "the duration of that type ii x - ray outburst is longer than the x - ray outbursts observed between 2007 november and 2008 november .",
    "it lasted about 100 days between mjd  52924 and mjd 53026 .",
    "there were no systematic optical observations during 2003 x - ray outburst and we could not know what happened in mxb  0656@xmath0072 . according to its long x - ray outburst duration ( nearly the whole orbital period ) ,",
    "we speculate that a much stronger mass ejection might have taken place before its 2003 outburst .",
    "due to the spectacular changes of the stellar wind environment during the type ii x - ray outburst , the disk size would increase very rapidly and the outer disk material could interact with the neutron star before or after it approaches to the periastron point .",
    "therefore , the type ii x - ray outburst could occur at any orbital phase and last a longer time than the type i x - ray outburst .",
    "the pca@xmath17hexte spectra of mxb  0656@xmath0072 during the 2007 - 2008 x - ray outbursts could be well fitted by a cut - off power law model with a low - energy absorption , together with an iron fluorescent line at @xmath196.4  kev and a cyclotron feature at @xmath1930.2  kev . unlike the model suggested by @xcite for the x - ray spectrum during the 2003 x - ray outburst ,",
    "a blackbody component is not necessary in our model for the x - ray spectrum during the 2007 - 2008 x - ray outbursts .",
    "the detection significance for the iron line around 6.4  kev and the cyclotron resonance scattering feature around 30  kev is at a larger than 99.99% confidence level .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the 3 - 22 kev could be calculated as @xmath53 , assuming a distance of 3.9 kpc @xcite .",
    "once the energy of the cyclotron resonance line was known , the strength of the magnetic field in the surface of the neutron star could be estimated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy of the fundamental cyclotron resonant scattering line and @xmath56 is the gravitational redshift , respectively @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath37 = 30.2@xmath57 in table  [ table : fit ] is the fundamental cyclotron line and @xmath56 = 0.3 for a typical neutron star with mass of 1.4  @xmath58 and radius of 10  km @xcite , the magnetic field could be calculated by equation  ( [ euqation3 ] ) to be @xmath59 g .",
    "the same variability of the soft and hard colors during the x - ray outbursts suggest no overall changes in the spectral shape of mxb 0656 - 072 in the 2.3 - 21.0 kev band . the x - ray flux during the outbursts",
    "should only be connected with the changes of the mass - accretion rate onto the neutron star around the periastron point .",
    "we presented and analyzed the optical and x - ray observations of mxb  0656@xmath0072 during different x - ray outbursts .",
    "a 101.2 day orbital period was found from a series of x - ray outbursts of the system between mjd  54350 and mjd  54850 .",
    "the position of this orbital period and the 160.4  s spin period in the corbet diagram confirms the be / x - ray binary nature of mxb  0656@xmath0072 .",
    "the anti - correlation between the h@xmath1 emission and the @xmath2 brightness during our 2007 observations indicates that a mass ejection event might have taken place before the first x - ray outburst in 2007 november .",
    "a low - density region was developed around the oe star in mxb  0656@xmath0072 after the mass ejection event , which could explain the decrease of the optical brightness during the 2007 observations .",
    "material was transferred into the circumstellar disk during the mass ejection event and a more extended disk formed after the mass outburst , which should be the reason for the strong h@xmath1 emission before the 2007 x - ray outburst . with the outward motion of the disk , the neutron star interacted with the outer part of the disk around the periastron passage and a series of transient x - ray outbursts",
    "could be triggered .",
    "according to the long duration of the 2003 type ii x - ray outburst , we speculate that a much stronger mass ejection event should have taken place before the 2003 outburst",
    ". the ejected material could fill all the orbital regions of the neutron star .",
    "the pca - hexte spectra during the 2007 - 2008 x - ray outbursts could be well fitted by a cut - off power law with low energy absorption .",
    "a gaussian iron line around 6.4  kev and a cyclotron resonance scattering line around 30  kev are also considered in the model .",
    "the same variability of the two x - ray colors in the 2.3 - 21  kev band indicated no overall changes in the spectral shape during the x - ray outbursts , which might only be connected with the changes of the mass - accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
