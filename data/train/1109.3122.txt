    "since the origin of the shell model @xcite , concepts such as orbital ordering , level occupancy and magic numbers have been extremely helpful to describe nuclear properties . in the last couple of decades , with the advances of rare isotope facilities , it has been possible to explore shell structure away from stability and perhaps expectedly , new orbital ordering , level occupancies and magic numbers",
    "have been revealed ( e.g. the doubly magic @xmath1o @xcite ) . in this quest of understanding shell evolution as one moves toward the limits of stability ,",
    "nuclear reactions have played a central role .",
    "examples of the ongoing intense activity are : the systematic knockout program at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) @xcite , the sequence of transfer measurements on unstable fission fragments at oak ridge national laboratory ( e.g. @xcite ) , the experiments by the high resolution array ( hira ) collaboration at nscl ( e.g. @xcite ) and the transfer program at argonne national laboratory on light systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is of paramount importance that the reaction theory used in the analysis of these reactions provide an accurate description of the process and that theoretical uncertainties be well understood .",
    "traditionally , the linkage between structure and reactions has often been made through the notion of a spectroscopic factor , a quantity directly associated with the occupancy of the single particle levels @xcite . by comparing the theoretical predictions for the cross section to the data , experimental spectroscopic factors ( @xmath2 ) can be extracted .",
    "these @xmath2 can then be compared to predictions from structure models @xmath3 .",
    "although both , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are model dependent , since the early days of the field , the methods for extracting @xmath2 were tuned such that @xmath2 for adding / removing a nucleon to a closed shell nucleus agreed with the independent particle picture .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in the systematic study presented in @xcite .",
    "this procedure has now been challenged by the results from @xmath4 data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 data are consistent with a reduction of proton spectroscopic factors for many closed shell nuclei by roughly @xmath5 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the apparent discrepancy between transfer and electron knockout can be understood by using a consistent single particle radial behavior for the removed particle as well as an improved reaction theory . along those lines , a re - analysis of ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) data on ca isotopes , using hartree - fock densities to constrain the single particle states , produce spectroscopic factors similar to those from @xmath4 @xcite .    with the possibility to study systems with large proton / neutron asymmetry , knockout studies revealed a strong dependence of the reduction factor @xmath6 on the relative energy between valence neutrons and valence protons ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this exciting work has been systematized through plotting the reduction factor @xmath7 as a function of the difference between separation energies : @xmath8 for proton ( neutron ) knockout . in this plot , all the stable systems previously studied through @xmath4 correspond to @xmath9 , but nuclear knockout measurements completed the plot for strongly negative and positive values .",
    "it was found that when removing loosely bound particles the reduction factor was closer to one , while when removing deeply bound particles the reduction factor could be as small as 0.25 .",
    "what is learnt from the analysis of the knockout data is that , for removing valence nucleons from closed shell nuclei , there is a considerable reduction of the spectroscopic strength as compared to the independent particle model , and that most large scale shell model calculations account for only part of this reduction .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of the key role of nn correlations within the nucleus .",
    "the exact nature of these correlations is still not fully understood as well as its dependence on proton / neutron asymmetry ( see @xcite for two recent contributions on this topic ) .    motivated by the exciting results from nuclear knockout experiments , transfer reactions @xmath0ar(p , d ) were performed at 33 mev / u , with the intention of studying the dependence of the reduction factor on the asymmetry @xmath10 .",
    "results published in @xcite show a clear disagreement on the trend of the reduction factor : while in knockout experiments one observes a strong variation of the reduction factor , in transfer data no such dependence is present .",
    "it has been pointed out that different beam energies could be at the heart of the disagreement since nuclear knockout experiments were all performed at around 70 mev / u while the transfer measurement were done at 33 mev / u . consequently , the @xmath0ar(p , d ) experiments have been repeated at higher energy and the analysis is in progress . despite this aspect , from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "it is pertinent to inspect the reaction theory used in the analyzes and evaluate the uncertainties .    due to the renewed experimental interest",
    ", there have been a number of studies on reaction theory for ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) , particularly concerned with uncertainties in the methods .",
    "examples include the study of optical potential uncertainties @xcite , the effect of the reaction mechanism @xcite , the uncertainties in the single particle state @xcite , the description of the deuteron continuum @xcite and the inclusion of full three - body dynamics in the reaction @xcite .    as in previous systematic studies @xcite , the recent @xmath0ar(p , d ) data @xcite were analyzed using the adiabatic wave model ( adwa ) developed by johnson and soper @xcite .",
    "this model provides an improvement over distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) in that it takes deuteron breakup into account explicitly , however it also makes a zero - range approximation , reducing the accuracy of the method . in @xcite , a correction to the zero - range approximation",
    "is introduced , namely the local energy approximation ( lea ) @xcite .",
    "note that , although not as simple as the zero - range adwa , there is a finite range formulation of adwa @xcite which has recently been studied in detail @xcite and compared to its zero range counterpart . in @xcite finite range effects",
    "are shown to be important for ( d , p ) reaction at deuteron energies around @xmath11 mev or larger and the lea prescription is shown to be inaccurate for energies well above the coulomb barrier . while the adiabatic model used in @xcite is very appealing due to its simplicity and the possibility of extracting a single spectroscopic factor , one should remember that it presents an approximate formulation to the full three - body problem @xmath12 .",
    "the adwa formulation is best if only small n - p distances contribute to the transfer cross section .",
    "faddeev techniques used to solve the exact three - body problem are useful to estimate the uncertainty involved in the practical adwa methods .    in this work we will re -",
    "analyze the results from @xcite with the finite - range version of adwa and using this improved reaction theory obtain the reduction factor for @xmath0ar ( section ii ) .",
    "we will also estimate uncertainties associated with the reaction theory , namely in what pertains the interaction and in the three - body reaction dynamics ( section iii ) .",
    "a final discussion and conclusions will be presented in section iv .",
    "the most recent analysis on a(p , d)b reactions @xcite have relied on the johnson and soper reaction model @xcite . given the relative importance of deuteron breakup in ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) reactions , johnson and soper consider the three - body problem of @xmath13 to describe the process .",
    "the exact t - matrix for the process can be written in prior form as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial bound state of the nucleus of interest @xmath16 , @xmath17 describes the relative motion of the proton and the target in the initial channel distorted by an optical potential @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the exact three - body wave function .",
    "johnson and soper expand the exact three - body wave function in a complete set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the @xmath20 subsystem : @xmath21 which includes the ground state of the deuteron @xmath22 and all scattering states @xmath23 of the @xmath20 system .",
    "the jacobi coordinates @xmath24 are the vector connecting the neutron and the proton , and the center of mass of nucleus b and the center of mass of the deuteron , respectively . in ref.@xcite , the zero - range approximation",
    "is made @xmath25 . with this approximation ,",
    "the three - body problem for calculating @xmath26 reduces to the solution of an optical - model - like equation where the distorting potential is the sum of the nucleon - target potentials evaluated at half the deuteron energy @xmath27 : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the kinetic energy operator associated with @xmath30 .",
    "this distorting potential @xmath31 incorporates deuteron breakup effects within the range of @xmath32 and thus is not meant to describe deuteron elastic scattering .    in the johnson and soper model , the remnant term @xmath33 in eq.[texact - eq ]",
    "is neglected and the transition amplitude simplifies to : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "it is well understood that generally the zero - range approximation for the deuteron is not accurate .",
    "a full finite range version of the adiabatic model of @xcite was introduced by johnson and tandy @xcite .",
    "therein the full three - body wave function is expanded in weinberg states of the @xmath20 system , and the schrdinger equation for the three - body problem is reduced to a set of coupled channel equations . the full coupled channel equations can be solved exactly @xcite but simplify tremendously when only the first term of the weinberg expansion is required .",
    "nguyen et al .",
    "@xcite use this approach to perform a systematic study of the effects of finite range , involving a wide range of targets and beam energies .",
    "those results show that finite range effects can be very significant at intermediate energies . a popular finite - range correction , the so - called local energy approximation ( lea ) , was introduced by buttle and goldfarb @xcite and relies on the truncation to first order of a series dependent on incoming momentum .",
    "comparisons performed in @xcite show that the local energy approximation performs well for sub - coulomb energies but may fail at intermediate energies .",
    "here we follow the procedure in @xcite and evaluate the deuteron distorting potential , taking into account the finite range of the deuteron : @xmath36 once the adiabatic deuteron wave @xmath37 is calculated using @xmath38 , the transfer amplitude can be obtained from : @xmath39 where the remnant term has been neglected @xmath33 .",
    "remnant term contributions for the cases under study here are no larger than @xmath40 .",
    "we perform finite range calculations for the three reactions under study : @xmath0ar(p , d)@xmath41ar(g.s . ) at 33 mev / nucleon as in @xcite . for comparison with @xcite",
    ", we include results for the zero - range calculations and the local energy approximation . for the description of the ar bound states of interest",
    ", we use a woods saxon mean field with radius @xmath42 fm and diffuseness @xmath43 fm as in @xcite , plus a spin - orbit interaction @xmath44 mev with the same geometry as the mean field ( note that the spin - orbit force in the bound state does not affect the extracted spectroscopic factors ) .",
    "details on the single - hole bound states can be found in table [ single ] .",
    ".properties of the single hole states : @xmath45 is the separation energy , @xmath46 is the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the hole state , and @xmath47 is it asymptotic normalization constant @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the optical potential uncertainty is independent of the three - body effects included in the faddeev description , and these are both independent from the experimental statistical error , we estimate the total error by summing in quadrature . these are shown in the last line of table [ errors ] .",
    "the largest increase in error is seen for the @xmath48ar case , and originates from the approximations in the reaction mechanism .    finally , as in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we calculate the reduction factor @xmath49 as a ratio of the experimentally determined spectroscopic factor and that obtained from large basis shell model calculations . for the purpose of consistency",
    ", we use the same shell model calculations reported in @xcite .",
    "these include the sd - shell model space and the usdb effective interaction @xcite for @xmath50ar and the sd - pf model space with the interaction of nummela et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath51ar .",
    "the predicted ground state spectroscopic factors for @xmath52ar , @xmath48ar and @xmath51ar are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , as shown in table ii .",
    "the reduction factors for @xmath52ar , @xmath48ar and @xmath51ar using the spectroscopic factors extracted from transfer cross sections and finite range adiabatic theory are plotted as black squares in fig .",
    "[ reduction ] and errors bars include only the experimental error .",
    "the total errors , including those from table [ errors ] , are represented by the green bars .",
    "the knockout results @xcite are plotted as red circles and only include statistical errors .",
    "in summary , we have reanalyzed the reactions @xmath0ar(p , d)@xmath56ar at 33 mev / nucleon using an improved reaction theory which includes deuteron breakup and finite range effects , based on the adiabatic wave approximation ( adwa ) .",
    "in addition we have quantified the errors in the reaction theory due to the optical potential and the approximate solution of the three - body problem . in order to do this",
    "we have performed exact three - body faddeev calculations . since our theory",
    "is based on nucleon optical potentials , we find that the optical potential uncertainty is below @xmath57% .",
    "however , differences between the adiabatic results and the faddeev results can be as large as @xmath58% .",
    "further detailed studies to better understand the source of these differences are underway .    with the present level of accuracy of the reaction theory , the slope suggested by the knockout data can be corroborated by the transfer data .",
    "our error bars do not include the uncertainties in the single neutron - hole overlap functions .",
    "here we use standard geometry and it is not clear whether , specially for @xmath59ar , this will be an adequate choice .",
    "measurements of the matter radius could provide additional constrains .",
    "ideally , these reactions could be repeated at lower energy in order to extract the asymptotic normalization of the overlap functions , which would then enable a much better handle on this additional ambiguity @xcite .",
    "although in this work we concentrate on the reaction theory for transfer , it is equally important to estimate theoretical errors associated with the description of the knockout reactions .",
    "our results call for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism in order to reduce the errors",
