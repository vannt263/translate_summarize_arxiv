    "the ` unitary limit ' of an ultracold fermi gas refers to the special scenario where the inter - atomic interaction is tuned to have its scattering length @xmath1 approaching infinity ( @xmath8 ) , leaving the fermi momentum @xmath9 as the only relevant length scale in the many - body system .",
    "this limit was discussed as early as 1999 by bertsch @xcite , who challenged many - body theorists with the question  what are the ground state properties of neutron matter , interacting with an infinite scattering length ? \" . under such condition",
    "the fermions are strongly interacting , thus the determination of the ground state is highly non - trivial .",
    "however , the equation of state at this limit is expected to be an universal expression @xmath10 where @xmath7 is an universal constant for any underlying fermion systems .",
    "it is of much interest to determine @xmath7 experimentally or derive it theoretically , many such attempts having been made @xcite . by far ,",
    "the best numeric estimate on @xmath7 is considered to be @xmath11 0.44(1 ) @xcite , 0.42(1 ) @xcite and 0.40(1 ) @xcite according to quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "the scattering length of trapped ultracold fermi gases can in fact be magnetically tuned @xcite by way of the feshbach resonance .",
    "this is indeed a very important achievement , and it is based on this that the above constant @xmath7 for trapped ultracold fermi gases can be experimentally measured .",
    "several recently reported experimental values for @xmath7 are @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite , we have calculated the constant @xmath7 for neutron matter using a tuned cdbonn realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential @xcite . unlike the case of trapped fermion gases , here the scattering length of nn interactions still can not be tuned experimentally . thus we have chosen to tune the nn interaction by adjusting its meson parameters , in line with the brown - rho scaling @xcite that the meson masses in nuclear medium is suppressed compared with their in - vacuum values .",
    "the @xmath0 scattering length of the original cdbonn potential is @xmath1=-18.9 fm , which is already fairly long .",
    "we have found that to have a very large scattering length ( such as -12070 fm ) the meson parameters of the cdbonn potential need to be adjusted only slightly ( about @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "this tuned cdbonn potential actually has given @xmath7 quite close to 0.44 for a wide range of densities ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we would like to investigate mainly the following question : is the constant @xmath7 given by other unitarity potentials , defined as those with infinite scattering lengths , also close to 0.44 ?",
    "this constant is supposed to be an universal constant , and then its value should be independent of the detail structure of the potentials as long as they have infinite scattering length . in other words ,",
    "@xmath7 given by all other unitarity potentials should in principle be the same",
    ". it may be difficult to prove this analytically .",
    "before one can do so , it should be useful and of interest to first check this universality property numerically as we shall do in the present work .",
    "as it is rather involved to tune the various realistic nn potentials @xcite to infinite scattering length , we have chosen to calculate @xmath7 from a family of simple hard - core square - well ( hcsw ) potentials @xmath20 an advantage of this type of potentials is that their scattering lengths can be given analytically and thus exact unitarity potentials can be readily obtained .",
    "the above hcsw potentials are clearly very different from the realistic nn potentials , yet as we shall discuss later the constant given by various hcsw potentials are all amazingly close to 0.44 , as is also given by the tuned cdbonn potential .    in the following we shall present some details of our calculations . in section iia , we shall first briefly outline the renormalized low - momentum interaction @xmath21 @xcite on which our calculations will be based .",
    "we shall carry out calculations using both hcsw and cdbonn potentials , both having strong repulsive cores . as is well - known",
    ", these hard - core potentials are not suitable for being used directly in many - body calculations .",
    "in contrast , the low - momentum interaction @xmath21 is a smooth and energy - independent potential , and it has been extensively applied to calculations of nuclear matter @xcite , nuclear structure @xcite and neutron star @xcite . this interaction is obtained using a renormalization group ( rg ) method where the high - momentum components of an underlying potential beyond a decimation scale @xmath22 are integrated out .",
    "the low - energy phase shifts are preserved by the rg procedure and so is the scattering length . in section",
    "iib the procedures for constructing our model unitarity potentials are presented .",
    "analytical expressions for the scattering length of hcsw potentials are given .",
    "from these expressions , one can construct an unlimited number of unitarity potentials ( which all have infinite scattering length ) .    in section iic",
    ", we shall describe how we calculate the neutron matter equation of state ( eos ) from the low - momentum interaction @xmath21 .",
    "two methods will be employed : a ring - diagram method @xcite and a model - space hartree - fock ( mshf ) method .",
    "there have been several many - body methods for calculating the eos for large ( number of particles approaching infinity ) fermionic systems such as atomic gases and nuclear matter . for a long time , the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory @xcite was the commonly used framework for such eos calculations ; an inconvenience of this method is that the bhf _",
    "g_-matrix interaction is energy dependent , adding numerical complications .",
    "we shall use the energy independent @xmath21 interaction mentioned earlier for the eos calculations , to circumvent the above inconvenience . with the use of the @xmath21 interaction , the mshf method provides a simple way for calculating the constant @xmath7 .",
    "in fact mshf is rather similar to bhf : in bhf the particle - particle correlations above @xmath9 are incorporated by way of the energy - dependent _",
    "g_-matrix , while in mbhf they are included via the energy - independent @xmath21 interaction .",
    "as we shall discuss later , the constant @xmath7 given by the ring - diagram method and the mshf method are in fact nearly identical ( both close to 0.44 ) .",
    "we shall also discuss that the mshf mean field potential should obey certain special constraint at the unitary limit .",
    "the importance of pairing in fermionic systems such as neutron matter has been well known and extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite and references quoted therin ) . in section iic",
    ", we shall discuss that pairing has also played an important role in our all - order ring diagram calculations where a pair of fermions are allowed to interact any number of times , forming a quasi - boson composed of a coherent pair of fermions .",
    "our results will be presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "a summary and conclusion will be given in section iv .",
    "since our calculations are largely dependent on the recently developed low - momentum interaction @xmath21 , it may be useful to present first a short review on this interaction .",
    "as we know , the strong short - range repulsion contained in @xmath23 usually requires a special renormalization treatment before being used in many - body calculations .",
    "a familiar such treatment is the bhf _",
    "g_-matrix method where the _",
    "g_-matrix interaction is obtained by summing the particle - particle ladder diagrams to all orders @xcite .",
    "an inconvenient aspect of this method is the energy dependence of _ g _ , making the many - body calculations based on _",
    "g _ rather complicated . in the past several years",
    ", there has been much progress in the rg approach to the nn interaction .",
    "a central idea here is that to describe the low - energy properties of a physical system it should be adequate to employ only a low - momentum effective interaction confined within a momentum decimation scale @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath21 is such a low - momentum effective interaction . starting from a realistic nn potential @xmath23",
    ", @xmath21 is obtained from the following _ t_-matrix equivalence equations @xcite : the half - on - shell _",
    "t_-matrix for the full - space interaction is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes principal - value integration and the intermediate state momentum @xmath26 is integrated from @xmath27 to @xmath28 covering the whole space .",
    "then we define a low - momentum half - on - shell _ t_-matrix by @xmath29 where the intermediate state momentum is integrated from @xmath27 to @xmath22 , the model space cut - off .",
    "the low momentum @xmath21 is then obtained by requiring the equivalence of",
    "_ t_-matrix in the model space , @xmath30 the low - momentum interaction @xmath21 is obtained by solving the above three equations .",
    "since this procedure preserves the half - on - shell _ t_-matrix , it certainly preserves the low - energy ( @xmath31 ) phase shifts and scattering length @xmath1 of @xmath23 .",
    "this ensures that if @xmath23 is tuned to be a unitarity potential ( @xmath32 ) , so is the corresponding @xmath21 .",
    "there are several realistic nn potentials ( cdbonn@xcite , argonne@xcite , nijmegen@xcite , chiral@xcite ) which all describe the two - nucleon low - energy experimental data very accurately .",
    "it would be of interest to obtain unitarity potentials from them by tunning their interaction parameters slightly .",
    "but technically this is not easy to carry out .",
    "so far only the cdbonn potential has been tuned to attain this limit ( @xmath1=-12070 fm)@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we choose hard - core square - well ( hcsw ) potentials as given by eq.(1 ) for further studying the properties of neutron matter at unitary limit .",
    "an advantage of using them is that their scattering length @xmath1 can be analytically obtained , allowing us to study the properties of neutron matter using many hcsw potentials with any chosen scattering lengths ( including infinity ) .    as indicated in eq.(1 ) , the hcsw potential is characterized by the height @xmath33 of the repulsive core , the depth @xmath34 of its attractive well , and the respective ranges @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the present work ,",
    "we consider neutron matter with interactions only in the @xmath0 channel , whose phase shift @xmath37 is readily obtained from eq.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "namely @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the scattering energy in the center - of - mass frame . from the above results",
    ", the scattering length @xmath1 is obtained from a low energy expansion of @xmath41 as @xmath42 with @xmath43 , \\nonumber \\\\   b & = & k_{20}tanh(k_{10}r_c)+k_{10}tan[k_{20}(r_b - r_c)]-r_bk_{10}k_{20 }   \\nonumber \\\\     & & + r_bk_{20}^2tanh(k_{10}r_c)tan[k_{20}(r_b - r_c ) ] ,          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 the effective range @xmath45 for this potential can also be derived analytically ; the result is not presented here because it is fairly lengthy .",
    "eq.(7 ) implies that the condition for being a unitarity potential ( infinite scattering length ) is _ _",
    "a__=0 , namely @xmath46 . \\label{width}\\ ] ] it is well known that when the potential is tunned to the unitary limit ( the feshbach resonance ) , it has a bound state with its energy approaching to zero .",
    "it is readily checked that the condition for having such a bound state is the same as the _ _",
    "a__=0 one given above .",
    ".three different unitarity hcsw potentials . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : coeffexp ]    by far , the best numeric estimates of the ratio @xmath7 have been obtained from the variational quantum - monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations ( see e.g. @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "it would be useful and of interest to compare our ring - diagram and mshf calculations with the qmc ones . as reviewed in @xcite ,",
    "superfluid - qmc calculations are generally based on the variation principle @xmath47 = 0,$ ] where @xmath48 is a bcs - paired trial wave function of definite number of particles and @xmath49 is a r - space jastrow correlator whose inclusion depends on the interaction employed ; its inclusion is necessary when an interaction with a ` hard - core ' repulsion is employed @xcite but not so for smooth potentials without ` hard core ' @xcite .",
    "clearly pairing is incorporated in superfluid - qmc by using a bcs - paired trial wave function . as discussed in section",
    "ii , we emphasize pairing differently , namely by including only the boson - forming ring diagrams to all orders ( both forward and backward ladder diagrams for a pair of fermions interacting any number of times ) , and in this way our all - order ring - diagram calculation treats the system as a collection of quasi bosons . despite this difference , it is encouraging that our result of @xmath500.44 is satisfactorily close to the superfluid - qmc value of @xmath51 to @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "it may be pointed out that when we include only the first order ring diagram , our ring - diagram calculation reduces to the usual hf calculation . for @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "we have carried out hf calculations ( i.e. including only the 1st - order ring diagram ) and obtained @xmath550.55 , for all the four unitarity potentilas mentioned earlier .",
    "this @xmath56 is significantly larger than the corresponding all - order - ring result of 0.44 .",
    "normal - qmc calculations ( where the trial wave function is a closed fermi sea ) have given @xmath500.54 @xcite .",
    "we believe that our 1st - order ring calculation is similar to that of the normal - qmc while our all - order ring - diagram one is similar to that of the superfluid - qmc ( where the trial wave function is @xmath57 ) .",
    "further studies of the above possible connections are needed .",
    "we have discussed in section ii that at the unitary limit the mshf s.p .",
    "potential has a special property , namely its effective mass @xmath58 and well depth @xmath59 satisfy a linear constraint dependent on the unitary ratio @xmath7 ( see eq.(18 ) ) .",
    "here let us check how well is this constraint obeyed by our results .",
    "similar to fig.5 , we have calculated @xmath60 and @xmath61 using the cdbonn and hcsw unitarity potentials using a wide range of @xmath9 from 0.8 to 1.5 @xmath62 .",
    "our results are plotted in fig.7 , and as seen most of our data are located near the straight line corresponding to @xmath7=0.44 . in the figure ,",
    "the results for @xmath9 in the range of ( 0.9 - 1.4)@xmath62 are quite close to the @xmath7=0.44 straight line . for @xmath9 outside this range , they are slightly off the line , which is consistent with the results of fig .",
    "it is promising that at the unitary limit the above mshf framework has given rather satisfactory results for the ratio @xmath7 ( @xmath52 ) , in close agreement with both the superfluid - qmc results @xcite and those from our all - order ring diagram calculations .",
    "in addition , this method is fairly simple and transparent ; as indicated by eq.(15 ) @xmath7 is given by a simple integral and the hf potentials at the unitary limit satisfy the constraint of eq.(19 ) .",
    "it may be mentioned , however , that this mshf is only a limited effective theory ; it is the @xmath63 limit of the ring - diagram formalism . in this",
    "limit the model space is one dimensional , and the model - space ground state wave function is @xmath64 , the closed fermi sea .",
    "the bcs pairing gap @xmath65 is an important quantity , but this information is not contained in the mshf effective theory .",
    "@xmath65 is the lower bound for the lowest excitation energy of the many - body system .",
    "mshf , however , is a one - dimensional effective theory which can describe only the ground state of the system ; it provides no information about excited states .",
    "the effective mshf theory is not capable to provide information about @xmath65 , even though the mshf wave function @xmath66 is completely @xmath67 paired . to calculate @xmath65",
    ", one may need to employ the number - nonconserving green s function framework @xcite which has been commonly used in supercoductivity ( superfluidity ) calculations .",
    "( the green s function method used in the present work is based on a number - conserving formalism , and is not suitable for calculating @xmath68 . ) using several skyrme effective interactions , su .",
    "@xcite have performed such number - nonconserving bcs calculations for nuclear matter .",
    "we plan to repeat their bcs calculations using instead the rg @xmath21 interactions , and will report our results in a separate publication .",
    "using several different unitarity potentials , defined as having infinite ( very large ) scattering length @xmath1 , we have calculated the ground - state energy ratio @xmath69 for neutron matter over a wide range of densities .",
    "a main purpose of our study was to check if the ratios so obtained are ` universal ' in the sense that they have a common value ( or nearly so ) , independent of the details of the potentials as long as they have @xmath32 .",
    "we have used four unitarity potentials : one is the unitarity cdbonn potential whose meson exchange parameters are slightly tuned so that its @xmath1 becomes very large ( -12070 fm ) .",
    "the other three are square - well ` box ' potentials with both hard - core repulsion and exterior attraction .",
    "the @xmath1 of these box potentials can be obtained analytically , making it easy to construct many unitarity box potentials of different ranges and depths .",
    "we have calculated @xmath7 using two methods : a ring - diagram method and a model - space hartree - fock ( mshf ) method .",
    "an important step in both methods is the transformation of the unitarity potentials , which have strong short - range repulsions , into low - momentum interactions @xmath21 which are smooth potentials , convenient for many - body calculations .",
    "the transformation is carried out using a renormalization group method which preserves low - energy phase shifts and the scattering length .",
    "we have found that the ratios @xmath7 given by the ring - diagram and mshf methods are practically identical over a wide range of densities ( from @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is an indication that the particle - particle hole - hole correlations ( as shown by diagram ( c ) of fig.1 ) are not important for neutron matter .",
    "such correlations are included in the ring - diagram method but not in mshf .",
    "the effect of the particle - particle ladder correlations ( as shown by diagram ( b ) of fig.1 ) are included in both .",
    "the mshf method is considerably simpler than the ring - diagram one .",
    "it may provide a promising method for neutron matter .",
    "further study of this method for neutron matter may be useful and of interest .",
    "the cdbonn and the three box unitarity potentials are very different from each other , but the ratios @xmath7 predicted by them using either of the above methods are all remarkably close to 0.44 , over a wide range of densities .",
    "this is indeed a rather interesting and surprising result , indicating that @xmath7 may be perceived a universal constant . for the mshf case , this result",
    "is related to some special properties of the @xmath21 interaction at the unitary limit .",
    "we have found that the @xmath21 interaction for mshf can be accurately simulated by a low - order momentum expansion of the form [ @xmath70 , and at the unitary limit the strength sum @xmath71 calculated from the above potentials satisfies the constraint of eq.(20 ) very well , for a wide range of @xmath9 .",
    "it is also found that at the unitary limit the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the mshf mean field potentials given by the above potentials all obey a linear constraint satisfactorily . in conclusion , we believe that our results provide strong numerical support to the conjecture that the ratio @xmath7 is universal .",

    "<S> the limit of @xmath5 , often referred to as the unitary limit , this ratio is expected to approach a universal constant , namely @xmath6 . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we calculate this ratio @xmath7 using a family of hard - core square - well potentials whose @xmath1 can be exactly obtained , thus enabling us to have many potentials of different ranges and strengths , all with infinite @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated @xmath7 using a unitarity cdbonn potential obtained by slightly scaling its meson parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios @xmath7 given by these different unitarity potentials are all close to each other and also remarkably close to 0.44 , suggesting that the above ratio @xmath7 is indifferent to the details of the underlying interactions as long as they have infinite scattering length . a sum - rule and scaling constraint for the renormalized low - momentum interaction in neutron matter at the unitary limit </S>",
