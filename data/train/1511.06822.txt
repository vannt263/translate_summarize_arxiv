    "in a mott insulator , the spin configuration arrangement attempts to minimize the energy by aligning the spins on the lattice sites . however , in some cases , the spin configuration arrangement makes it impossible to minimize the energy on all spins on the lattice sties at the same time - a situation known as the geometrical spin frustration .",
    "the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are a mott insulator on a square lattice @xcite , where there is no geometrical spin frustration .",
    "superconductivity is then realized when charge carriers are doped into this parent mott insulator , where the phase diagram is characterized by two salient phenomena , the high temperature superconductivity and the occurrence of the pseudogap @xcite . in particular",
    ", the pseudogap is particularly obvious in the underdoped regime , where the doping concentration is too low for the optimal superconductivity .",
    "a number of experimental probes @xcite show that below a characteristic temperature @xmath0 , which can be well above the superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature @xmath1 in the underdoped regime , the physical response of cuprate superconductors can be interpreted in terms of the formation of a pseudogap by which it means a suppression of the spectral weight of the low - energy excitation spectrum . in this case ,",
    "an important issue is whether the pseudogap phenomenon occurred in the doped square - lattice mott insulators is universal or not . by universality",
    "we refer to the pseudogap phenomenon that does not depend on the details of the geometrical spin frustration .",
    "the doped mott insulators on a honeycomb lattice in many ways provide an ideal arena in which to explore this question .",
    "this follows a fact that the honeycomb lattice is a loosely coupled lattice with only three nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , where the strongly geometrical spin frustration and quantum fluctuation exist @xcite , and therefore allowing a test of the effect of the geometrical spin frustration on the pseudogap state .",
    "although there are only a few examples of materials where the spins are located on a honeycomb lattice , many fascinating phenomena have been reported in experiments @xcite , such as the quantum spin - liquid state and superconductivity . on the other hand , the mott insulators on a honeycomb lattice",
    "are also of interests in their own right , with many unanswered questions @xcite .    in the doped square - lattice mott insulator ,",
    "the physical quantity which most evidently displays the signature for the pseudogap is the charge transport , which is manifested by the optical conductivity and resistivity , where the characteristic features are that the conductivity is divided into two - components by the pseudogap with a non - drude - like narrow band centered around energy @xmath2 followed by a broadband centered in the midinfrared region , while the resistivity grows nearly linearly with temperature @xcite . in particular",
    ", this two - component conductivity extends to the pseudogap boundary in the phase diagram at @xmath0 .",
    "however , this anomalous structure of the conductivity spectrum in the pseudogap state can not be described by the standard landau fermi - liquid theory . in our earlier studies",
    "@xcite , the charge transport in the doped square - lattice mott insulators has been discussed by considering the pseudogap effect , and then all main features of the optical measurements on the doped square - lattice mott insulators are qualitatively reproduced @xcite . in this paper , we try to study the charge transport in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators along with this line .",
    "we show that the qualitative behavior of the conductivity in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators is similar with that obtained in the doped square - lattice mott insulators .",
    "in particular , we show that the transfer of the part of the low - energy spectral weight in the conductivity in the low - doped regime to the higher energy region to form the midinfrared band can be also attributed to the effect of the pseudogap on the infrared response in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism is presented in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , where we generalize the theory of the charge transport from the previous case in the doped square - lattice mott insulators to the present case in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators , and then evaluate explicitly the conductivity . within this theoretical framework ,",
    "the quantitative characteristics of the conductivity in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators are discussed in sec .",
    "[ transport ] . finally , we give a summary in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "and @xmath3 .",
    "each unit cell contains two sites ( indicates by open and solid circles ) belonging to the sublattices a and b , respectively .",
    "[ honeycomb - lattice ] ]      within the framework of the fermion - spin theory ( [ fermion - spin - theory ] ) , the charge transport in the doped square - lattice mott insulators has been discussed @xcite , and the result shows that the striking behavior of the low - energy non - drude peak and unusual midinfrared band is closely related to the emergence of the pseudogap . in the following discussions , we generalize these analytical calculations from the case in the doped square - lattice mott insulators @xcite to the case in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators , and then evaluate explicitly the conductivity .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , there are two sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the unit cell , and in this case , the charge - carrier and spin green s functions are two - dimensional matrices . following our previous discussions for the case in the doped square - lattice mott insulators @xcite , the corresponding intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice parts of the full charge - carrier green s functions can be evaluated explicitly as ( see the appendix [ app ] ) ,    [ full - charge - green - function-2 ] @xmath29    where @xmath30 , and the mean - field ( mf ) charge - carrier excitation spectrum @xmath31 , the spin correlation function @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the number of the nn sites on a honeycomb lattice , @xmath34 , while the charge - carrier self - energies are obtained as ,    [ self - energy-2 ] @xmath35    with the corresponding intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice parts of the self - energy , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , repectively , that are evaluated explicitly in the appendix [ app ] . in a doped mott insulator , the strong correlation effect and the related charge - carrier quasiparticle coherence",
    "are closely related to the charge - carrier self - energy @xmath38 , and then the behavior of the charge - carrier quasiparticle is most fully described in terms of the charge - carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - green - function-2 ] ) .",
    "now we turn to calculate the conductivity of the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators in terms of the full charge - carrier green s functions ( [ full - charge - green - function-2 ] ) .",
    "the conductivity in the system is expressed as @xcite , @xmath39 with the electron current - current correlation function , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electron current operator .",
    "the external magnetic field can be coupled to the electrons , which are now represented by @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the fermion - spin representation ( [ fermion - spin - theory ] ) . for the calculation of the electron current density ,",
    "we need to obtain the electron polarization operator , which is a summation over all the particles and their positions , and can be evaluated in the fermion - spin representation as @xmath44 .",
    "the electron current operator on the other hand is obtained by evaluating the time - derivative of the polarization operator @xmath45 $ ] as @xcite ,    @xmath46    in the fermion - spin approach , this electron current operator ( [ tcurpara1 ] ) can be decoupled as , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the charge - carrier s particle - hole parameter . the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tcurpara2 ] ) refers to the contribution to the electron current density from the electron spin , however , it has been shown explicitly @xcite that @xmath49 , i.e. , there is no direct contribution to the electron current density from the electron spin , and then the majority contribution to the electron current - current correlation comes from the charge carriers ( then the electron charge ) .",
    "however , the strong interplay between the charge carriers and spins has been considered through the spin s order parameters entering in the charge - carrier part of the contribution to the current - current correlation . in this case",
    ", the electron current - current correlation function can be evaluated in terms of the full charge carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - green - function-2 ] ) as , @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice current vertices are given by ,    [ current - vertices ] @xmath51,\\\\ \\gamma_{\\rm inter}({\\bf k})&=&-{2\\over 9}(\\chi t)^{2}[2\\cos(2\\sqrt{3}k_{y})-2\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y})+4\\cos(3k_{x})\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y})+4\\cos(3k_{x}/2)\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y}/2)\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y})\\nonumber\\\\ & -&6\\cos(3k_{x}/2)\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y}/2)+\\cos(3k_{x})-7]/[2\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y})+4\\cos(\\sqrt{3}k_{y}/2)\\cos(3k_{x}/2)+3],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the intra - sublattice charge - carrier bubble @xmath52 is obtained from the corresponding intra - sublattice part of the charge - carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - longitudinal - part-2 ] ) as , @xmath53 and is closely related to the quasiparticle scattering within the same sublattice , while the inter - sublattice charge - carrier bubble @xmath54 is obtained from the corresponding inter - sublattice part of the charge - carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - transverse - part-2 ] ) as , @xmath55 and therefore is directly associated with the quasiparticle scattering between the sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 . substituting the electron current - current correlation function ( [ correlation-1 ] ) and the intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice charge - carrier bubbles ( [ bubbl-1 ] ) and ( [ bubbl-2 ] ) into eq . ( [ conductivity-1 ] ) , we thus obtain the conductivity as @xmath56 , where the intra - sublattice conductivity @xmath57 and inter - sublattice conductivity @xmath58 can be evaluated explicitly as ,    [ conductivity ] @xmath59    respectively , where the intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice components of the charge - carrier spectral functions are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , while @xmath62 is the fermion distribution function .",
    "in fig . [ conductivity - fit-1 ] , we plot the conductivity @xmath63 as a function of energy at doping levels ( a ) @xmath64 and ( b ) @xmath65 for parameter @xmath66 with temperature @xmath67 , where the charge @xmath68 has been set as the unit .",
    "it is remarkable that as the case of the doped square - lattice mott insulators @xcite , @xmath63 at the low - doped regime is separated into two bands , with the higher energy band , corresponding to the _ unusual midinfrared band _ , that shows a broad peak around @xmath69 for @xmath64 , while the low - energy band forms a sharp peak at @xmath2 , and deviates strongly from the drude behavior . to show this deviation from the drude behavior clearly ,",
    "we have fitted our present result of @xmath63 for the doping concentration @xmath64 , and the fitted result is also shown in fig .",
    "[ conductivity - fit-1]a ( dashed line ) .",
    "obviously , the fitted result of the lower - energy peak decays as @xmath70 .",
    "this @xmath71 decay of the conductivity at low energies is closely related with the linear temperature resistivity , since it reflects an anomalous frequency dependent scattering rate proportional to @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 as would be expected in the standard landau fermi - liquid .",
    "furthermore , as seen from fig .",
    "[ conductivity - fit-1]b , although the weight of the midinfrared band increases with the increase of doping , the midinfrared band moves towards to the low - energy non - drude band . in particular , we find that the low - energy non - drude peak incorporates with the midinfrared band in the high - doped regime , and then the low - energy drude type behavior of the conductivity recovers .",
    "all these results are qualitatively similar to the case in the doped square - lattice mott insulators @xcite , reflecting that the two - component conductivity is a universal feature for the doped mott insulators .        in eq .",
    "( [ conductivity ] ) , there are two parts of the quasiparticle contribution to the redistribution of the spectral weight in the conductivity @xmath63 : the contribution from @xmath57 comes from the spectral function obtained in terms of the intra - sublattice part of the charge - carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - longitudinal - part-2 ] ) , and therefore is closely associated with the quasiparticle scattering within the same sublattice , while the additional contribution from @xmath58 originates from the spectral function obtained in terms of the inter - sublattice part of the charge - carrier green s function ( [ full - charge - transverse - part-2 ] ) , and is closely related to the quasiparticle scattering between the sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 . within the framework of the fermion - spin theory ,",
    "the essential physics of the charge transport in the doped honeycomb - lattice mott insulators is the same as that in the doped square - lattice case @xcite , and can be attributed to the emergence of the pseudogap .",
    "this follows a fact that there is an intrinsic link between the self - energy and pseudogap .",
    "the charge - carrier self - energy @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ self - energy-2 ] ) also can be rewritten as @xcite , @xmath75^{2}\\over \\omega+\\varepsilon^{(\\nu)}_{\\bf k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the energy spectrum of @xmath38 , while @xmath77 is the pseudogap , and is therefore identified as being a region of the self - energy effect in which the pseudogap suppresses the spectral weight .",
    "this pseudogap @xmath77 and the corresponding energy spectrum @xmath76 can be obtained explicitly in terms of the self - energy @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ self - energy-2 ] ) as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , with the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this case , the pseudogap parameter is obtained as @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ pseudogap ] , we plot the pseudogap parameters @xmath83 ( solid line ) and @xmath84 ( dashed line ) as a function of doping for @xmath66 with @xmath67 . it is shown clearly that although both @xmath83 and @xmath84 decrease monotonously with the increase of doping , the decrease of the magnitude with increasing doping is faster in @xmath83 than in @xmath84 . in particular , @xmath85 near the half - filling . since both the pseudogaps @xmath83 and @xmath84 appear in the intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice green s functions in eq .",
    "( [ full - charge - green - function-2 ] ) , they together induce the transfer of the part of the low - energy spectral weight in the conductivity in the low - doped regime to the higher energy region to form the midinfrared band . moreover , the onset of the region to which the spectral weight is transferred is close to the sum of the pseudogaps @xmath86 , and then the decrease of the pseudogaps with increasing doping therefore leads to a shift of the position of the midinfrared band towards to the low - energy non - drude peak .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath87 ( dashed line ) as a function of doping with @xmath67 for @xmath66 .",
    "[ pseudogap ] ]",
    "within the framework of the fermion - spin theory , we have studied the charge transport of the doped mott insulators on a honeycomb lattice by taking into account the pseudogap effect .",
    "our result shows that the conductivity spectrum in the low - doped regime is separated into a non - drude peak centered around energy @xmath2 followed by a broad midinfrared band .",
    "however , the decrease of the pseudogaps with increasing doping leads to a shift of the position of the midinfrared band towards to the low - energy non - drude peak , and then the low - energy drude type behavior of the conductivity recovers in the high - doped regime . incorporating the present result with that obtained in the doped square - lattice mott insulators @xcite , it is thus shown that the two - component conductivity induced by the pseudogap is a universal feature in the doped mott insulators .",
