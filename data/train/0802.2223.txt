    "nanowires have been considered as ideal tools for probing nano - materials@xcite . in real applications ,",
    "the scanning probe microscopes ( spm ) represent the typical realization@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the tip of the probe is crucial .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the properties of the tip . from theoretical point of view",
    ", the tip can be ideally considered as the end of a one dimensional nanowire . the physics is thus embedded in the semi - infinite nanowires . in various situations",
    ", it is known that edge states may arise at the end .",
    "nevertheless , conventional studies of the 1d wire have mostly been focused on its bulk properties , whereas assembled nanowires can only have finite lengths and must terminate at some sites ( the ends , or the edges ) .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate effects that are due to the ends .    in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the presence of the edge can be handled by method of image or its generalization@xcite . in this case , effects due to the ends are identified and reflected in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "for example , because the end couples @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the wavefunction is modulated by @xmath2 so that the van hove singularity is suppressed in the local density of states near the end@xcite .",
    "the more interesting situation occurs when the reflection symmetry is broken . in that case , it is shown that localized edge states may arise and result in peaks in the tunneling spectrum@xcite .",
    "these conclusions are based on free electrons in which the problem is linear so that method of image is applicable . in real materials , particularly in nano - materials , interactions can not be neglected . in that case , the applicability of method is called into question .",
    "it is therefore of important to examine the applicability of method of image or find a general method to handle the boundary .    in this work",
    ", we shall show that indeed the method of image can be generalized even in the presence of interactions .",
    "the generalization results from a combination of method of image and the bosonization technique . by adopting the method of the functional bosonization ,",
    "recently developed by yurkevich@xcite , we show that the boundary conditions can be easily implemented .",
    "the marriage of the two methods allows one to investigate effects due to the edge states in the most general situations . to illustrate our method",
    ", we shall consider the simplest situation that supports the edge states : spinless electrons in dimerized semi - infinite nanowires , which would correspond to fermionized spin - chains .",
    "we shall first establish the existence of the edge state in the presence of interactions .",
    "this will be investigated by considering a dimerized spin chain .",
    "the method of functional bosonization is then combined with the method of image to calculate the two - point correlation function for dimerized nanowires .",
    "finally , the bosonization of the partition function for semi - infinite nanowire will be derived .",
    "based on the derived partition function , we perform a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis and obtain the rg flow equation .",
    "the implication of the effect of the edge state on itinerary electrons will be discussed .",
    "we shall first illustrate that under appropriate conditions , the edge states exist and persist even in the presence of strong interaction .",
    "for this purpose , we start by considering a dimerized semi - infinite spin - chain in which the transverse spin coupling changes alternatively . the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic field , @xmath5 when @xmath6 is odd and @xmath7 when @xmath6 is even . by applying the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11",
    "is then mapped into the hamiltonian of spinless electrons with interaction between nearest neighbors @xmath12 here the applied @xmath4 field is equivalent to the chemical potential . in the absence of the @xmath13 term , @xmath14 reduces to free electron model with dimerized hopping amplitudes .",
    "this is the model that can describe polyacetylene@xcite . in this case , the bulk dispersion can be solved exactly and is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the lattice constant .",
    "it is clear that the spectrum has a gap @xmath17 . for semi - infinite chains , previous studies",
    "show that when @xmath18 , there is an edge state that decays exponentially from the edge with energy right at zero@xcite .",
    "it is conceivable by continuity that the edge state survives when @xmath19 is turned on as long as @xmath19 is small in comparison to the gap . to check how the edge state evolves in the presence of interaction , we solve @xmath20 ( instead of @xmath14 ) by resorting to method of exact diagonalization .",
    "the energy of the edge state can be found by tuning @xmath4 and measuring the local density of electrons at the 1st site .",
    "as @xmath4 sweeps across the edge state , a large change of the local density occurs due to the fact that the edge state is localized . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the numerical result of 7 sites of spin chain .",
    "the jump in the local density is clearly manifested .",
    "the energy of the edge state can be read out by finding the magnitude of @xmath4 at the jump . in fig .  2 ,",
    "we show the energy of the edge state versus @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , one sees that in presence of interactions , the edge state persists except that the energy is no longer right at zero .",
    "to understand how the localized edge state interacts with extended states , we shall first consider the case without the boundary to illustrate the effect of dimerization on the extended states . in this case , the hamiltonian of the extended states for spinless electrons is @xmath21 here when @xmath6 is odd , @xmath22 , otherwise , @xmath23 . in the absence of @xmath24 , there are two bands separating by a gap .",
    "we shall set the fermi energy @xmath25 in the upper band .",
    "after the fourier transformation , the kinetic term becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "note that because the lattice consists of two sublattices : even sites and odd sites , the theory is a two - component theory with the obvious notations : @xmath28 represents @xmath29 at odd sites and @xmath30 represents @xmath29 at even sites . to focus on the itinerant electrons , we linearize @xmath31 in k near the fermi wavevector @xmath32 . by replacing @xmath33 by @xmath34 ,",
    "the action for the kinetic terms becomes @xmath35 here @xmath36 and phase factors , @xmath37 , have been absorbed into @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",

    "note that @xmath45 $ ] is the fermi velocity .    in the absence of interaction , the green s function can be found by rotating to a new basis so that the action is diagonalized .",
    "for example , for the left mover , the relation between the new basis and the old basis is @xmath46 with @xmath47 being given by ( in the @xmath0 space ) @xmath48k}{2\\varepsilon_f } ] & exp[\\frac{-i im[\\tilde{v_f}% ] k}{2\\varepsilon_f } ] \\\\",

    "if one denotes @xmath58 , one can write @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the phase shift . thus linearizing with respect to @xmath61 results in a shift of @xmath62 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath63 therefore , the position shift can be attributed to the phase shift between even sites and odd sites . clearly , when @xmath64 , @xmath65 approaches @xmath66 . in this case , @xmath67 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that when @xmath64 , electrons on two neighboring sublattice points have the same amplitudes .",

    "however , due to the matrix nature of the action , the @xmath76 fields can not be expressed as a phase factor,@xmath78 , as what happens in the case when @xmath79@xcite . to avoid this difficulty , we first perform the transformation of eq.([3.15 ] ) .",

    "this position shift should not matter . because the anti - bonding states are @xmath89 below the fermi energy , we can drop the anti - bonding states and keep the bonding states with the action being given by @xmath90 at this stage",

    "we conclude this section by noting that the bosonization of dimerized chains is almost the same as that for one band model except when calculating green s functions , positions have to be shifted appropriately as indicating in eq.([3.19 ] ) .",

    "note that eq.([boundary ] ) also implies @xmath130 .",
