    "phase ordering by quenching from a region of the phase diagram where a material is uniform to one where several phases coexist at equilibrium provides an important technique for creating multi - phase materials that are inhomogeneous on mesoscopic length scales .",
    "since the macroscopic properties of such materials can be quite different from those of the constituent phases and depend sensitively on the mesoscopic structure , a solid understanding of pattern formation in phase - ordering systems is important to several branches of materials science .",
    "examples include precipitation strengthening in metals @xcite and fabrication of glasses@xcite .",
    "universality allows one to describe the structure and dynamical properties of diverse phase - ordering systems using models that only take into account properties such as conservation laws and order - parameter symmetries .",
    "two important universality classes involve only local relaxational dynamics and an order parameter that can be represented as a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is not conserved in the first class , called model a. this can be used , for example , to model anisotropic magnets and alloys undergoing order  disorder transitions . in the second class , called model b , the order parameter is a locally conserved quantity , and relaxation proceeds by diffusion away from regions of high chemical potential .",
    "when hydrodynamic modes and strain effects can be ignored , binary mixtures and alloys are described by this model .",
    "scaling is the hypothesis that the behavior of the system over a large range of length scales can be described in terms of a single characteristic length @xmath0 .",
    "a necessary condition for scaling is that @xmath0 must be well separated from any other microscopic or macroscopic length scales present in the system . for many phase - ordering processes ,",
    "the characteristic length has been found to have a power - law dependence on the time , @xmath1 , elapsed since the quench , @xmath2 . in",
    "non - conserved systems the power law is readily observable with @xmath3 for conserved systems the late - time growth exponent is @xmath4 , although processes occurring at early times may mask this behavior .",
    "both of these universality classes are important .",
    "however , the work reported here is restricted to non - conserved systems , for which more detailed theoretical results are available .    here ,",
    "scaling and universality in phase ordering are tested by comparing numerical solutions of the langevin equation involving two different forms for the local part of the free - energy functional : the @xmath5 ginzburg - landau form and a piecewise - linear triangular form .",
    "the numerical details are presented in sec .",
    "the agreement between the structure factors found for both forms is discussed in sec .",
    "iii . combined with a mapping to sharpen the interfaces , numerical solution of the langevin equation allows comparison to analytic theories for the structure factor , _ without _ fitting parameters . in sec .",
    "iv three theories are reviewed and compared to the numerical results .",
    "the ohta - jasnow - kawasaki theory agrees with the simulations at small and large wavevectors with noticeable deviations only for intermediate wavevectors .",
    "the theories by mazenko are qualitatively correct , but the zeroth - order theory agrees with the simulations better than the second - order theory .",
    "v is a brief summary of our results .",
    "a general model of phase ordering can be constructed from a free energy composed of a local term with two degenerate minima and a nonlocal term representing the contribution from spatial fluctuations @xcite , @xmath6   = \\int d{\\bf r } \\left\\{f\\left[\\psi({\\bf r},\\tau)\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}|{\\bf\\nabla}\\psi({\\bf r},\\tau)|^2 \\right\\ } \\;,\\ ] ] where the scalar order - parameter field @xmath7 depends on position @xmath8 and time @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of the model are governed by a langevin equation , @xmath9}{\\delta \\psi({\\bf r},\\tau ) } + \\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\eta({\\bf r},\\tau ) \\;,\\ ] ] where the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to deterministic relaxation towards a minimum of the free energy , and the second term represents thermal fluctuations .",
    "the thermal noise is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and correlations given by @xmath10 the strength of the noise is given by the normalized temperature @xmath11 , which is the only parameter in the model after rescaling the order parameter , space , and time@xcite .",
    "the primary effect of thermal fluctuations is to introduce randomness at early times@xcite . in the late - time scaling regime the dynamics of this model are controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point , and thermal fluctuations can be ignored .    the local part of the free - energy functional @xmath12 is usually chosen to have the ginzburg - landau form , @xmath13 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\psi^2({\\bf r},\\tau ) +   \\frac{1}{4}\\psi^4({\\bf r},\\tau ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] which is a double well with degenerate minima .",
    "the corresponding dynamical equation is @xmath14 which is commonly called the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation .    to test universality for non - conserved scalar order - parameter systems ,",
    "comparisons need to be made with a model different from the standard tdgl model .",
    "the new model still needs to follow the non - conserved dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : leq ] ) for a scalar order parameter with two degenerate equilibrium values .",
    "one obvious aspect to change is the form of the local part of the free - energy functional , @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "a choice quite different from the ginzburg - landau form is a piecewise - linear triangular double well , which is not harmonic near the minima .",
    "this form is compared to the @xmath5 ginzburg - landau potential in fig .",
    "it has been chosen to match the ginzburg - landau potential at the extrema , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the langevin equation for this potential is @xmath18    the simulations with both potentials were conducted on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions and lattice constant @xmath19 .",
    "the system size considered was @xmath20 .",
    "the laplacian was approximated by an @xmath21-point form @xcite , and and a simple euler integration scheme with @xmath22 was used to collect data every @xmath23 time units up to a maximum of @xmath24 .",
    "results for the tdgl equation were averaged over @xmath25 realizations ; only @xmath26 realizations of the piecewise - linear model were needed to confirm its agreement with the tdgl results .",
    "the average structure of the system at a specific time after the quench can be described by the order - parameter correlation function @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes averaging over the ensemble of quenches as well as the volume .",
    "when scaling holds , the correlation function can be expressed in terms of a time - independent master curve , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "while microscopy techniques can be used to measure @xmath31 , scattering experiments probe its fourier transform , @xmath32 , called the structure factor .",
    "the structure factor is also related to a time - independent form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the dimension of the system .",
    "when infinitely sharp domain interfaces are randomly oriented throughout the system , the small-@xmath36 form of the correlation function is linear , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is proportional to the surface area to volume ratio for the domains @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a power - law decay of the scaled structure factor at large @xmath39 , @xmath40 , called porod s law @xcite .",
    "these results are valid for @xmath41 much smaller than the characteristic length , but much larger than the domain interface width .",
    "the assumption of infinitely sharp interfaces is used in most situations , _",
    "e.g. _ experimental and analytic studies . by design",
    ", the domain interface in the simulations has a width of about @xmath42 .",
    "we compensate for this by using a non - linear mapping@xcite of @xmath7 to @xmath43 before finding the fourier transform @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the structure factor is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scattering intensity associated with a particular domain pattern @xmath7 , and @xmath28 represents averaging over the ensemble of quenches .",
    "the simulation results used to estimate the structure factor were found by `` onion - shell '' binning of the two - dimensional scattering intensity into a one - dimensional function@xcite of @xmath47 , averaging over all trials , and then scaling the result using the average wavevector of each bin .    including noise in the simulation has three drawbacks .",
    "the first is purely practical : generating gaussian random numbers for @xmath48 is computationally expensive .",
    "the second drawback has a physical basis .",
    "ohta @xcite has shown that thermal fluctuations in the tdgl equation retard growth of the characteristic length and cause a broadening of @xmath49 thirdly , the thermal noise causes the structure factor to cross over to the equilibrium @xmath50 behavior for large @xmath39 , thus masking the @xmath51 porod tail . for these reasons , we have simulated the tdgl equation at zero temperature with the early - time fluctuations implemented by an initial condition where @xmath52 consists of independent random numbers distributed uniformly on @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , thermal fluctuations are essential for simulating the piecewise - linear model . for this model at @xmath54 ,",
    "the domain growth stops after a finite time .",
    "the time until the evolution stops , as well as the corresponding characteristic length , depends on the random initial condition .",
    "if a system which has stopped coarsening is briefly heated , the growth continues for a while and then stops again .",
    "in addition , making the potential shallower prolongs growth and yields larger domains .",
    "the arrested growth appears to result from trapping into metastable configurations associated with finite wavelength corrugations on the interfaces .",
    "a constant , moderate level of thermal noise completely prevents this trapping phenomenon , so noise with @xmath55 was included in simulations of the piecewise - linear model .",
    "an estimate of @xmath56 was constructed for each local form by combining the estimates at different simulation times with the restrictions @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for @xmath47 larger than this ,",
    "lattice effects become important .",

    "the agreement seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) , a log - log plot of @xmath60 vs.  @xmath39 , is very good .",
    "the porod tail at large @xmath39 can be highlighted by plotting @xmath61 against @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "this was found independently of the structure factor , using @xmath34 before the binning and averaging .",
    "the agreement is quite good well into the power - law tail .",
    "the claim that the details of the local part of the free - energy functional do not influence the universal behavior appears well supported by the numerical models .",
    "several theories for the universal form of the scaling function for non - conserved systems exist . they can be compared to the numerical integration of the tdgl equation without adjustable parameters .",
    "one theory was developed by ohta , jasnow , and kawasaki ( ojk ) @xcite .",
    "the ojk theory starts from a diffusion equation for a gaussian auxiliary field , @xmath62 , @xmath63 where the interfaces in the inhomogeneous material are defined to be the set of @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , and the order - parameter field is obtained by the mapping @xmath66 $ ] .",
