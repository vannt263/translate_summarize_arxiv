    "interest in the coalescence of binary compact objects was motivated by the development of gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors , and the need for a better understanding of the endpoint of binary merger@xcite . especially in the case that such mergers end in black hole formation these might be the most powerful , and certainly the most interesting sources of detectible gws . beyond that main motivation ,",
    "there are several other reasons such mergers are of interest to the physics research community ; see ref.@xcite for a detailed review . from the outset it was understood@xcite that binary coalescence , driven by gw radiation , could be viewed as having three stages .",
    "the first is the gradual inspiral of the objects in orbits , most probably nearly circular orbits , gradually decreasing in orbital energy , and hence in radius , driven by the radiation reaction to the gws being emitted .",
    "this first stage can be understood as a quasi - newtonian process with gw radiation reaction treated as a time averaged loss of orbital energy .",
    "considerable accuracy could be achieved by using post - newtonian ( slow motion , weak field ) approximations@xcite .",
    "the last stage of binary coalescence is the oscillation of the black hole formed by the coalescence .",
    "these oscillations , after initial transients , are the `` quasinormal ringing '' ( qnr ) of the final hole .",
    "it has been known since the early 1970s@xcite that these qnrs constitute a spectrum of complex ( i.e. , damped ) frequencies characteristic of the mass and spin of the final black hole .    the second stage , the middle stage in the binary coalescence ,",
    "may usefully be called the `` plunge . ''",
    "it is the end of the early gradual inspiral , and determines the magnitude and phase of the qnr .",
    "most important , this relatively short transition is the stage during which the major part of the gw energy is radiated@xcite .",
    "ironically , this most - important stage is the part of the coalescence that is least understood .    for a wide variety of merger scenarios , the excitation of qnr _",
    "is _ known .",
    "the remarkable progress in numerical relativity in the past decade@xcite has given detailed results for the gw signals produced .",
    "these results , however , do not give a qualitative , phenomenological understanding of the plunge process , an understanding at the same level as that we have for the early inspiral and late qnr .",
    "in addition to the satisfaction that such an understanding could provide , there are possible practical advantages . with an intuition about the plunge",
    ", computational searches could be guided to particularly interesting scenarios . in this paper",
    "we attempt to give a first step , an intersting first step , towards the understanding of the plunge .",
    "we attempt here to give a simple understanding , more precisely a simple view of the generation of plunge radiation and the excitation of qnr .",
    "the ultimate goal is a set of guidelines that could allow a complete quasi - analytic description of merger .",
    "it should be noted in this connection that the difficulty posed by the plunge , the end of inspiral and beginning of qnr , has been recognized as a challenge in the effective one body formalism@xcite .",
    "the result we present is a very simple general picture : the plunge is determined by the conditions of the binary associated with the `` light ring , '' ( lr ) the location of photon orbits . this picture is supported both by a mathematical reason that the picture should apply , and by a variety of examples . the simple general picture , however , must be viewed as somewhat speculative since it depends on several approximations . by far , the most important of these is the particle perturbation approximation .",
    "we have also limited our analysis to nonrotating ( schwarzschild ) black holes and , in some aspects of the mathematical analysis , to simplified models . despite these approximations",
    ", we feel that the picture that emerges is very compelling as a first step that can motivate and guide further work .",
    "there has been considerable past work@xcite reported on the connection between the lr and qn frequencies .",
    "of particular relevance to our current work is the analysis of the multipole content of merger ringdown radiation and the relationship of the start of ringdown to the passage of the particle through the light ring@xcite .",
    "our interest here is somewhat different , not only to observe the connection in the radiative signal but to understand its origin , and to understand the transition to the ringdown and the peak of the radiation .",
    "the approach presented in the sections below consists of the following steps .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fdgf ] we introduce the particle perturbation approximation and the idea of using the fourier domain green function ( fdgf ) to understand , with simple mathematics , the analytic connection between the motion of our point particle and the excitation of plunge radiation and qnr . with this technique",
    ", the radiation is reduced to a single , relatively simple , integral over the path of the particle .",
    "the use of the fdgf , in fact , is one of the elements of our hope that the plunge can be understood .",
    "the basis of that hope is that the qn frequency is a pole in the fdgf .",
    "this is true in very broad generality , so the way in which a particle source `` excites '' a pole should have significant universality .",
    "excitation in a simple model may therefore tell us a great deal about a much more complicated realistic model . with this motivation",
    "we introduce , in this section , a model with a very simple fdgf .",
    "even this simple model , however , is complicated enough in its details to be distracting , so most of these details are deferred to an appendix .    next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cubic ] we define a class of trajectories that allow for simple analysis combined with sufficient flexibility to test models .",
    "in this section , also , we show that the perturbations computed from the fdgf , for the simple model , agree to high accuracy with numerical evolution of initial data .",
    "we then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : radial ] , use the fdgf to investigate what it is about the trajectory that determines the excitation of qnr .",
    "our investigations in this section are limited to radial motions , since our model is based on a scalar charged particle source of a scalar field .",
    "for the scalar case , orbital motion modifies the source with a multiplicative , time dependent angular factor .",
    "by contrast , for the gravitational and electromagnetic case , the source term has extra additive terms for angular motion . our scalar model , therefore , will not give results that are representative of gravitational wave generation , it does however give interesting insights into the excitation of qnr and to the plunge radiation .",
    "our conclusions from sec .",
    "[ sec : radial ] are extended and tested in sec .",
    "[ sec : schw ] , where we show them to be valid for trajectories in the schwarzschild background . in this section",
    "we include investigations both of radial motion and motion with angular orbital motion and we show in this section that the plunge radiation and qnr are determined by the angular as well as the radial motion of infall .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we give a viewpoint on why the lr plays the important role in the generation of qnr .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] and relate the work presented to directions for further investigations .",
    "some details of the complete fdgf are given in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "we use units in which @xmath0 and other conventions of the text by misner , thorne and wheeler@xcite .",
    "the following acronyms will be used throughout the paper : qn = quasinormal ; qnr = quasinormal ringing ; lr = light ring ; fdgf = fourier domain green function .",
    "we will typically use the capital @xmath1 to indicate particle time , and the lower case @xmath2 for other uses , in particular as part of the retarded time of received radiation .",
    "we start by considering a model of a perturbation field @xmath3 generated by particle motion in a schwarzschild background . in effect",
    ", this particle perturbation model is justified by the fact that it applies in the limit of an extreme ratio of the masses of the binary compact objects@xcite .",
    "but an important question is whether phenomena in the extreme mass limit are qualitatively similar to the phenomena for comparable mass binaries .",
    "many examples show that this does seem to be the case .",
    "one such example is the analysis of the antikick phenomenon found with numerical relativity computations for comparable mass@xcite . with particle perturbation analysis @xcite",
    "it has been shown that this paradoxical phenomenon has a simple underlying explanation .",
    "the current paper uses the history of such successes as the reason to look for particle perturbation modelling as an appropriate step toward understanding the plunge and the excitation of qnr .",
    "the great advantage of particle perturbation theory is , of course , that the equations describing the fields are linear , and allow the insights of a fourier transform and , for a spherically symmetric background , of multipole decomposition .    for greatest simplicity",
    "we take our model to be based on a scalar perturbation field , @xmath3 , coupled to a scalar - charged particle .",
    "we start the analysis by decomposing @xmath3 into spherical harmonics @xmath4 and by writing the equation for the @xmath5 multipoles as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the regge - wheeler@xcite `` tortoise coordinate '' defined in terms of the standard schwarzschild areal coordinate @xmath8 , by @xmath9 the crucial feature of the @xmath7 coordinate is that it remaps the semi - infinite scope ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) of the schwarzschild areal coordinate to @xmath12 to @xmath11 .",
    "the `` curvature potential''@xcite , @xmath13 depends on the type of field ( scalar , electromagnetic , gravitational perturbation)@xcite .",
    "what is common to all these potentials is that for @xmath14 the potential has the form of a centrifugal potential , @xmath15 and that as @xmath16 the potentials fall off exponentially in @xmath7 , that is , as @xmath17 .",
    "the transition between the flat spacetime centrifugal potential and the dramatically decreasing exponential form occurs around the `` light ring , '' @xmath18 , the location of circular photon orbits .    for the problem in which we are interested",
    ", the source term @xmath19 is a point particle moving in the equatorial ( @xmath20 ) plane with radial position @xmath21 . the nature of the source term , like the specifics of the potential , depends on details of the model .",
    "the source term may contain a delta function , or derivatives of delta functions , or sums of such terms .",
    "our paradigmatic simplest case will be the scalar problem , with a source term that contains only a delta function , not its derivatives . in this case",
    "the source will have the form @xmath22 here @xmath23 , which in general may depend on @xmath24 , can be used to represent , e.g. , time dependence of scalar charge or , as shall be discussed later , orbital motion .",
    "this factor will almost always be taken as @xmath25 , but will be useful in sec .",
    "[ sec : cubic ] for comparing numerical results .",
    "we now change notation in two ways .",
    "first , we drop the @xmath24 indices which will be clear from the context of the models to follow .",
    "second , we will want to generalize the background rather than be limited to that of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "our generalization , in fact , focuses on eq .",
    "( [ eq : schweq ] ) as a wave equation in one spatial dimension . to emphasize this ,",
    "we replace @xmath7 by the coordinate @xmath26 , with the understanding that it ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : schweq ] ) , then is replaced by @xmath28      we define the time domain green function @xmath29 by the differential equation @xmath30 and the same boundary conditions that apply to eq .",
    "( [ eq : schweq ] ) : outgoing radiation ( i.e. , propagating to larger @xmath26 ) at @xmath31 , and ingoing radiation ( i.e. , propagating to lower @xmath26 ) at @xmath32 .",

    "this complexity is a disadvantage for intuitive insights , and adds significant difficulty to evaluations of green function solutions .",
    "for that reason we illustrate some of the features of our analysis with a model that has a very simple green function . the truncated dipole potential ( tdp)@xcite is defined by @xmath40 in this simple model , the sharp edge at @xmath41 plays the role of the steep dropoff of the schwarzschild potential for @xmath8 less than around @xmath42 . with the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdppot ] ) for the schwarzschild curvature potential , the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdgf ] ) take an elementary form both for @xmath43 and @xmath44 . matching conditions then lead to a simple polynomial equation to be solved for the qn frequencies .",
    "there are disadvantages to making the substitution of the tdp for the schwarzschild potential , both obvious and not .",
    "the obvious disadvantage is that the substitution raises the question whether the insights provided will be applicable to the schwarzschild background .",
    "a partial answer to this question is the observation that the phenomenon of complex frequencies occurs in the tdp ( and in other truncated multipole potentials ) .",
    "it is reasonable to infer that the excitation of the tdp and the schwarzschild potential will show _ qualitatively _ similar dependences on particle motions .",
    "the real answer to this question , however , is found in the models of sec .",
    "[ sec : schw ] ; the insights from the tdp model _ do _ seem to give correct insights into the nature of plunge radiation and qnr in schwarzschild models .",
    "the not - so - obvious disadvantages of the tdp model are , however , worth a consideration .",
    "one of these disadvantages is the `` quality factor '' of the qn modes , the ratio of the real ( oscillatory ) part of a qn frequency to the imaginary ( damping ) part .",
    "for the least damped of the schwarzschild quadrupole modes , the modes of prime importance to gw astrophysics , this ratio is 4.2 , while for the single tdp pair of modes it is 1.0 . due to the low quality factor , qnr in tdp radiation does not have the same lightly damped sine wave appearance as for qnr in schwarzschild models .",
    "worse than this visual inconvenience is the fact that the damping part of the qnr for tdp models is smaller than that for the schwarzschild models .",
    "( more specifically , the tdp damping frequency is @xmath45 or @xmath46 if we associate @xmath47 with @xmath42 .",
    "the schwarzschild damping frequency @xmath48 is about half of that . )",
    "we will argue that qnr is determined by the features of the orbit within a damping time of crossing the lr .",
    "the longer damping time for tdp than for schwarzschild , means that this principle of lr importance is tested more stringently in the tdp models than in schwarzschild models .",
    "it would be ideal , of course , to have a model for the potential term that has all the features we would like , but for which the fdgf has an elementary form . a sharp cutoff at some @xmath47 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdppot ] ) , guarantees that for @xmath43 the green function has a simple elementary form .",
    "the challenge is to find the right form of @xmath49 for @xmath44 .",
    "one such possibility is the pschl - teller potential@xcite , sech@xmath50 , but this potential does not approach the flat spacetime centrifugal potential at large @xmath26 and hence is a questionable subsitution .",
    "an obvious question is why we do not use a higher order truncated multipole potential , i.e. , @xmath51 , with an integer @xmath52 larger than unity . for all such potentials the green function has only elementary functions .",
    "as @xmath52 increases , however , the green function  though elementary becomes more and more complicated .",
    "furthermore , the quality factor of the least damped qn mode increases slowly with increasing @xmath52 . we would have to go to @xmath52 of order 10 to get a ratio of damping to oscillation that is qualitatively similar to qnr in the schwarzchild geometry@xcite .",
    "the complete fdgf for tdp , and its derivation , are given in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "the explicit expressions for the fdgf depend on the relative location of @xmath26 , @xmath47 , and particle position @xmath53 , but all expressions are simple .",
    "as an example , for @xmath54 the expression is @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the tdp qn frequencies @xmath57 which show up , as expected , as poles in the fdgf .    for a known trajectory @xmath58 , we can find the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xeq ] ) , for @xmath44 , at all times , by using @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdpfdgf ] ) for @xmath59 , and the green function ( in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convenient ] ) ) for @xmath60 . to do this we introduce notation for times of importance @xmath61 and @xmath62 , important times along the trajectory .",
    "( the notation @xmath62 arises from the step - by - step development of the tdp fdgf in appendix  [ sec : appa ] . ) these times , and the integration variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are defined by @xmath65 @xmath66 we take @xmath67 ; the solution is then @xmath68\\,dt\\ ] ] @xmath69\\,dt\\,.\\ ] ] the second integral extends to @xmath61 , the time at which the particle , moving inward , passes the potential `` edge '' at @xmath41 .",
    "this integral represents the contributions to the field from the pre - crossing motion ; the first integral gives the contribution for the motion subsequent to the edge passage .",
    "to investigate the generation of radiation , we must choose particle trajectories for the schwarzschild background , for our tdp , or for the other models that we will introduce below .",
    "there are several features we would like in a family of trajectories .",
    "first , we would like all trajectories in the family to conform to the analog of the physical constraints on trajectories in the schwarzschild background .",
    "the most fundamental of these constraints is that @xmath70 as the particle approaches the horizon . for our trajectory family to be used with eq .",
    "( [ eq : xeq ] ) we therefore require @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "we also require that the trajectories belong to a family with at least two parameters . in this way",
    ", we can compare the radiation for a range of trajectories with one feature of the trajectories fixed .",
    "it is in this way that we will argue that the plunge radiation and qnr are not sensitive to the nature of the trajectory away from the edge .",
    "a third criterion for a family of trajectories is one of convenience . as a check on details , it is useful to compare the computation of @xmath73 done with the fdgf integrals , like those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiintegrals ] ) , to the solution found by evolving initial data in the standard manner used in numerical relativity . for such evolution",
    ", we need initial data , and the most convenient initial data is static initial data , i.e. , the fields that would exist at time zero if the particle had been sitting in a fixed position forever , and only started to move at time zero .",
    "note that the motion before time zero is needed not only for evolution codes , but is also needed for the green function solution , since the integrals , e.g. , the second integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiintegrals ] ) , require a specification of the particle position back to the infinite past .",
    "for static initial data , both @xmath74 and @xmath75 must vanish at time zero .",
    "this in turn means that for our trajectories both the velocity and acceleration must be zero at time zero .",
    "a desideratum , though not a requirement , is that the family of trajectories leads only to simple closed form analysis .",
    "the following two - parameter family for the radial motion , our `` cubic trajectory '' family , satisfies this as well as the three criteria above : @xmath76 the two parameters are @xmath77 , the initial @xmath26 position of the particle , and @xmath78 , the timescale on which the particle accelerates . for @xmath79 , both the velocity @xmath80 and acceleration",
    "@xmath53 ( not to be confused with `` @xmath53 '' used in the previous section as a proxy for @xmath81 ) are @xmath82 and both go to zero as @xmath83 .",

    "[ fig : schw_difftauv3 ] the retarded time ( after crossing the lr ) and amplitude of the qnr are almost independent of the speed at the lr .",

    "( to be sure , there will be additional functions of @xmath184 , but these will play the role of constants in the evaluation of the residues at the qn poles . )",

    "( [ eq : simpleint ] ) . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : schw_difftauv3 ] therefore tell us that the late radiation dominates the excitation of qnr .",
    "another , somewhat surprising , conclusion can be drawn from these results for schwarzschild radial infall .",
    "figure  [ fig : schw_diffv ] shows the plunge radiation increasing with increasing speed at the lr .",

    "this suggests that when there is angular velocity @xmath185 , it is the angular velocity @xmath186 at the lr that is important , as well as the radial velocity @xmath187 .    if we are to investigate our hypothesis that plunge radiation and qnr excitation is determined only by the conditions , in this case the angular velocity , at the lr , then we need at least a two - parameter family of trajectories for @xmath188 or @xmath189 , and for clarity of analysis we would like to vary the orbital motion for a fixed choice of radial motion .",
    "as we have explained for radial motion , the models need not be limited to families of trajectories that are physically correct motions . in the case of angular motion , however , we _ do _ need to consider several physical limitations on the nature of @xmath184 .",

    "if we do not , then the plunge radiation and qnr , for interesting values of @xmath186 , are hidden by the much larger radiation coming directly from the particle motion .",
    "a second feature of physically correct angular motion is that @xmath191 at the lr .",
    "if we were to retain this feature it would hamper the demonstration that it is only the value of @xmath184 at and near the lr that is important .",
    "though this feature hampers our demonstration , it supports our hypothesis .",
    "since @xmath184 near the lr is not very different from at the lr , our hypothesis would be wrong only if conditions on @xmath184 far from the lr would be important .",

    "[ fig : projected ] we plot , in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparo ] , a comparison of the frequency exhibited by the computed wave ( inferred from the spacing between the zeros of the waveform ) and the frequency that one expects for radiation coming directly from the particle s orbital motion .",
    "this expected frequency is computed by noting , for a particular `` emission time '' in the particle s trajectory , the angular frequency of the particle as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "the `` observation time '' is then computed for the radiation from this event to reach the wave extraction radius @xmath235 ; it is this observation time that is the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparo ] . the frequency",
    "is then multiplied by two to account for the fact that the gravitational waves are @xmath236 .",
    "lastly , the doppler shift of the outgoing radiation is taken into account by dividing the frequency by @xmath237 , where @xmath80 is the ingoing radial speed of the particle at the emission time .",
    "the excellent agreement between this prediction and the waveform observed leaves no doubt that this is `` direct '' radiation , and unrelated to the relatively low quasinormal frequency ( indicated in the plot by a short horizontal line ) .",
    "the analysis of direct radiation may turn out to be more than a useful check on consistency ; it may turn out to be an interesting diagnostic in the kerr spacetime . in the schwarzschild spacetime ,",
    "the amplitude vs.  frequency result has , embedded in it , information about the way in which the curvature potential acts as a high pass filter for radiation passing outward .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that amplitude vs.  frequency curves may lead to an effective kerr curvature potential .    .",
    "the @xmath231 part of the solution is presented . ]",
    "are noisy due to the small amplitude of the computed waves .",
    "five - point averaging was applied to smooth the waveform results below @xmath238 .",
    "the horizontal bar shows the value of a period corresponding to the frequency @xmath239 for the least damped qn quadrupole mode .",
    "see text for details of the computation of the frequency inferred from the particle motion . ]",
    "though great attention has been given to the connection of qn frequencies and the lr@xcite , much less has been given to the question of why the lr should play such a crucial role in the generation of plunge radiation and the _ excitation _ of qnr ?",
    "from the point of view of multipole decomposition and the curvature potential , this is because the curvature potential takes a simple flat spacetime multipole form for @xmath240 , and is negligibly small far on the other side of the lr ( more precisely for @xmath241 ) . but this observation is not an explanation .",
    "an explanation must be rooted in the physical process being described before multipoles are projected .",
    "that physical process is the generation of disturbances by the motion of a particle .",
    "disturbances propagate along characteristics , the same world lines as the paths of photons .",
    "consider a particle and an observer both far outside ( @xmath240 ) a black hole .",
    "disturbances ( scalar or whatever ) of the particle will travel on the usual characteristics connecting the moving particle to the observer . due to the presence of the black hole ,",
    "however , there will be extra , non - flat - spacetime characteristics connecting the particle and observer .",
    "these will correspond to zoom - whirl orbits that go around the black hole , just outside the lr , and end up at the particle .",
    "though interesting as a matter of principle , these extra `` nonstandard '' characteristics will play little role if the black hole is far away ; the cross section for such characteristics will be too small .",
    "when the particle is close to the lr , however , the effect of the zoom - whirl characteristics will be dramatic .",
    "these `` extra '' characteristics will dominate over the standard characteristics as the particle passes through the lr .",
    "it is expected , and confirmed by studies of trajectories , that as the particle proceeds inward , its characteristics more and more lose the ability to reach the external observer and the particle and observer become more and more causally disconnected .",
    "this picture of the zoom - whirl characteristics give a fairly persuasive heuristic argument that radiation that will be characteristic of the black hole , plunge radiation and qnr , must come from the region of the lr .",
    "in this paper we have used the fourier domain green function to understand why the excitation of plunge radiation and quasinormal ringing might be determined by source conditions at the light ring of a black hole .",
    "we then verified that hypothesis of light ring cruciality with models both using green function computations and numerical evolution . a particular insight informed by both methods was that the plunge radiation and quasinormal ringing , at least in the case of radial infall , can be primarily ascribed to the particle motion after crossing the light ring .",
    "such insights can be viewed as a successful first step in understanding the plunge / ringing phase of binary black hole inspiral / merger , but only the first step . in particular , this work has relied on the particle perturbation linearization of general relativity .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that the lessons from that simplification apply to the binary motion of comparable mass holes , but this needs to be investigated .",
    "it will be necessary to extend our study to rotating holes , an extension which will be particularly interesting since there are two distinct light rings in the equatorial plane , one for prograde photon orbits and one for retrograde orbits , and there are light rings for a continuum of radii if nonequatorial orbits are considered .",
    "work on this analysis is already underway .",
