    "low - mass x - ray binaries are systems in which a low - mass companion star transfers material onto a neutron star or back hole .",
    "most of the systems have orbital periods of hours to days and contain ordinary hydrogen - rich donor stars . the minimum orbital period for systems with hydrogen - rich donor stars",
    "is around 80 min @xcite , however , systems with hydrogen - poor or degenerate donor stars can evolve to extremely small binary separations with orbital periods as short as a few minutes @xcite .",
    "such systems are called ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) and have a range in orbital periods from 11 to 50 minutes ( see @xcite )    x - ray spectroscopy has identified several candidate ucxbs based on similarities with the known ucxb 4u185087 where the inferred enhanced neon / oxygen ratio is interpreted as being local to the system . @xcite thus concluded that the candidate ucxbs have ultra - short periods and proposed that their donors stars were originally carbon - oxygen or oxygen - neon - magnesium white dwarfs .",
    "there are 12 systems with known or suggested orbital periods , which include a transient pulsar , x - ray busters and millisecond pulsars ucxb candidates have also been identified via their low optical - to - x - ray flux ratio and optical faintness .",
    "this is what is expected for the small accretion discs in these systems , because the optical emission is dominated by the irradiated accretion disc whose surface is determined by the size of the binary i.e. the orbital period ( for an observational review see @xcite ) .",
    "4u1822000  was discovered by uhuru and has since been observed briefly by all the major x - ray missions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and has been roughly constant in the x - rays with an unabsorbed flux of @xmath0 in the 0.520kev range @xcite .",
    "it has a faint @xmath1=22 optical counterpart @xcite and was identified as an ucxb candidate based on its low x - ray / optical flux ratio .",
    "chandra observations show that the x - ray source is coincident with the optical position and there no evidence for orbital modulation in the x - rays ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "obtained optical photometry of the optical counterpart using the 6.5 m magellan telescope and detected significant variability on a timescale of about 90mins . in this letter",
    "we report on our optical time - resolved photometry of 4u1822000 .",
    "our optical photometric observations were taken on 2006 july 23 using the 4.5 m william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "we used the tek 1024@xmath21024 pixel ccd camera at aux - port focus , a ccd binning of 2@xmath22 was used providing a plate scale of 0.22 arcsecpixel@xmath3 and an unvignetted ( circular ) field diameter of 1.8arcmins . the johnson @xmath1-band filter was used and the total observation time length on 4u1822000  was approximately 5h .",
    "the exposure time of each individual frame was 60s and with a readout time of 13s , we obtained one image approximately every 1.2min over the course of our observations .",
    "the conditions were not photometric because of the calima ( sahara dust ) , but the seeing was excellent , ranging from 0.6 to 1.0arcsecs .",
    "we used iraf for our initial data reduction , which included bias subtraction using the overscan regions of the ccd , and flat - fielding using sky flat fields taken during twilight .",
    "the ultracam reduction pipeline software was then used to obtain lightcurves for 4u1822000  and several comparison stars by extracting the counts using aperture photometry . a variable aperture which scaled with the seeing",
    "differential lightcurves were then obtained by computing the count ratio of 4u1822000  with respect to a local standard ( non - variable star ) . as a check of the photometry and systematics in the reduction procedure , we also extracted lightcurves of a comparison star similar in brightness to the target .",
    "the photometric accuracy of 4u1822000  for each exposure is about 10 percent and agrees with the scatter of the comparison star with similar brightness .",
    "figure1 shows the lightcurve for 4u1822000  which clearly exhibits a strong modulation .",
    "given the baseline of our dataset of 5h , a lomb - scargle analysis of the lightcurve does not reveal any significant periods on timescales of less than a few hours .",
    "however , fitting the lightcurve with a sinusoidal modulation reveals a period of 191@xmath48min and a semi - amplitude of 0.083@xmath5mags .",
    "although the determination of the period is biased because our baseline is just less than twice the period , it should be noted that @xcite also saw a modulation on a timescale of @xmath6180min ( 2@xmath290min ; note that they observed half a periodic modulation ) .",
    "we have found a 191min sinusoidal modulation in the optical lightcurve of 4u1822000  which most likely arises from either x - ray irradiation of the inner face of the secondary star and/or a superhump modulation from the accretion disc .",
    "sumperhumps only occur in binaries with extreme mass ratios ( such as ucxbs ) , and are due to a precessing , eccentric accretion disk @xcite , which have observed optical periods a few percent longer than the binary orbital period .",
    "thus the 191min period most likely lies close to the orbital period of the binary , and we assume this to be the case in the rest of the discussion .",
    "@xcite determined the absolute magnitude of x - ray binaries and derived an empirical relation between the absolute magnitude ( @xmath7 ) , orbital period ( @xmath8 ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath9 )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the eddingtion luminosity ( 2@xmath12ergs@xmath3 for a 1.4@xmath13 neutron star ) .",
    "their relation was based on the assumption that the optical flux is due to x - ray irradiation of the accretion disc , which means that ucxbs with short orbital periods are expected to have relatively faint discs .",
    "therefore faint @xmath14 values have been used to select ucxb candidates which have @xmath153.7 @xcite .",
    "indeed 4u1822000  was provisionally classified as an ucxb based on its faint absolute magnitude ; @xmath157.5 assuming a distance of 8kpc ( even if the distance is 20kpc , @xmath14=5.5 ) and the lack of hydrogen and helium emission lines in it s low quality vlt optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , our estimate of the orbital period of 191min casts severe doubts on the ucxb nature of 4u1822000 .    based on our estimate for the orbital period and",
    "assuming that 4u1822000  is a persistent x - ray binary , we can use the van paradijs & mcclintock relation and the distance modulus to estimate the distance to 4u1822000 .",
    "the optical magnitude of 4u1822000  is @xmath1=22 @xcite and the optical extinction can be determined using the empirical relation between the optical extinction ( @xmath16 ) and the total column density of hydrogen @xmath17 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . using the observed value for @xmath18 @xcite we find @xmath16=5.5mag . using the de - reddended optical magnitudes , the unabsorbed x - ray flux of 1.1@xmath19 ( determined using the observed x - ray flux , the power - law index and @xmath17 given in @xcite ) and @xmath8=191min in conjuction with equation ( 1 ) and the distance modulus",
    ", we find the distance to 4u1822000to be 6.3@xmath42.0kpc and @xmath202.6@xmath21 ( the errors relfect the uncertainties in the van paradijs & mcclintock relation )",
    ".    we can use the distance and the x - ray flux to estimate the observed mass accretion rate , which can be compared to theoretical mass transfer rate expected for gravitational radiation and magnetic braking . the unabsorbed x - ray flux and the distance of 6.3kpc give the accretion luminosity which suggests an observed mass accretion rate of @xmath22(d/6.3kpc)@xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( = @xmath25 ) is the efficiency of converting accretion into radiation for a neutron star .",
    "this is comparable with estimates for the mass transfer rate onto a 1.4@xmath26 neutron star driven by a combination of magnetic braking and gravitational radiation for a main sequence star @xcite .    finally , assuming that the 191min period is the orbital period then we can estimate the mean density ( and spectral type ) of a roche - lobe filling main - sequence in such a binary ; @xmath27 @xcite . for 4u1822000",
    "we find @xmath28=7.5@xmath29 which corresponds to a m45 dwarf star @xcite .",
    "the chandra heg and meg x - ray spectrum of 4u1822000  can be fitted with a power - law and blackbody model and does not show any features that may indicate that it is an ucxb .",
    "furthermore , our determination of a 191min period ( which we believe is close to the orbital period ) casts severe doubts on the ucxb nature of 4u1822000 . given this ,",
    "it is puzzling that no hydrogen or helium emission lines are seen in the optical vlt spectra .",
    "however , this could be due to the poor quality of the spectra @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to make a comparison with the similar short period xrbs , such as 4u1323 - 619 , exo0748676 and grmus @xcite , with orbital periods of 2.96hr , 3.82hr and 3.93hr respectively .",
    "the optical lightcurves of these systems , which are all x - ray bursters , show a sinusoidal modulation with partial eclipes / dips consistent with the idea that a large reprocessing region in the disk is being partially obscured by structure at the disk edge . in all these system ,",
    "broad emission lines are observed .",
    "in contrast the optical lightcurve of 4u1822000  contains only a sinusoidal component , which suggests that system lies at a relatively low inclination angle .",
    "however , this does not explain the lack of emission lines , which one would expect to be independent on orbital phase for systems at low inclination angles .",
    "clearly a more detailed photmetric and spectroscopic study will prove useful .",
