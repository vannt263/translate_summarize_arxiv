    "separable morphisms were introduced in @xcite by a. carboni and g. janelidze for lextensive categories . in the way of @xcite one can consider separable morphism in a lextensive category @xmath0 , the category of families of objects in a category @xmath1 . what we call",
    "@xmath2 below can be seen as a special case of this situation , a characterization of separable morphisms for which is given by theorem [ teorema ] .",
    "g. janelidze and w. tholen @xcite defined separable morphisms in a category @xmath3 for a given pointed endofunctor of @xmath3 . given an adjunction @xmath4 one can consider separable morphisms with respect to the induced monad . then , in a special case , an appropriate adjunction @xmath5 between @xmath0 and the category of sets gives the same notion of separable morphism in a lextensive category @xmath0 as @xcite .    definition [ ganmarteba ] in this paper is essentially of @xcite , the difference being that in place of an adjunction we consider a galois structure , which together with a pair of adjoint functors @xmath4 consists of specified classes of morphisms @xmath6 and @xmath7 , called fibrations , in @xmath3 and @xmath8 respectively ( see g. janelidze @xcite , the earlier reference is g. janelidze @xcite ) , and we require separable morphisms to be fibrations .    our purpose is to describe the class of separable morphisms for the galois structure introduced by r. brown and g. janelidze in @xcite ( @xmath9 below ) .",
    "theorem [ teorema2 ] states that for this galois structure separable morphisms are exactly the kan fibrations which are covering maps of simplicity sets .",
    "in this section @xmath3 is a finitely complete category .",
    "let @xmath8 be a full reflective subcategory of @xmath3 with the inclusion @xmath10 .",
    "suppose the reflection @xmath11 and its unit @xmath12 are chosen in a such way that the counit is an identity @xmath13 .",

    "[ ganmarteba ] a fibration @xmath21 from @xmath6 is called a separable morphism with respect to the galois structure @xmath22 if the diagonal @xmath23 is a cartesian morphism with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "consider an example .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a category with a terminal object @xmath24 .",

    "a morphism @xmath25 consists of a map @xmath26 and morphisms @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",

    "it is straightforward that a morphism @xmath38 is cartesian with respect to this galois structure if and only if all @xmath39 are isomorphisms .",
    "we will consider two galois structures ; first @xmath2 , in which :              note that this structure is a special case of the example from the section [ section ] , when @xmath1 is the category of connected simplicial sets .",
    "then , it is easy to see that cartesian morphisms with respect to @xmath2 are exactly the trivial coverings of simplicial sets in the usual sense .          observe that an injection @xmath44 is cartesian with respect to @xmath2 ( i.e. trivial covering of simplicial sets ) if and only if each connected component of @xmath45 either is contained in the image of @xmath1 under @xmath46 , or has no intersection with it .",
    "we will use this observation for @xmath47 ( here and further @xmath48 denotes the pullback of a typical @xmath21 by itself ; @xmath49 is the diagonal @xmath50 ) . in this case , let @xmath51 denote the image of @xmath1 under @xmath49 ; it consists of all simplices of the form @xmath52 in @xmath48 .",
    "let in a diagram ( * * ) @xmath53 be a separable morphism with respect to @xmath2 , what is to say that @xmath49 is cartesian with respect to @xmath2 . if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the n - simplices of @xmath1 corresponding to the diagonal morphisms of ( * * ) , then @xmath56 , and the pair @xmath57 is an n - simplex of @xmath58 .",
    "the upper horizontal morphism in the diagram ( * * ) gives a vertex @xmath59 of @xmath1 , and by commutativity of ( * * ) @xmath60 is a vertex of @xmath61 .",
    "so , the connected component containing the simplex @xmath61 has an intersection with @xmath51 , but then by separability of @xmath49 it is completely contained in @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath64 be a connected component of @xmath48 the intersection of which with @xmath51 is not empty .",
    "@xmath64 contains a vertex of the form @xmath60 , @xmath65 $ ] . if @xmath66 ( @xmath67 $ ] ) is another vertex of @xmath64 , then there is a path from @xmath60 to @xmath68 in @xmath48 .",
    "wherein the upper horizontal morphism is determined by @xmath72 and the diagonals by @xmath73 and @xmath74 . since these diagonals are equal @xmath75 , yielding also @xmath76 .",
    "applying this argument consecutively to 1-simplices in the chain connecting @xmath60 with @xmath66 we get @xmath77 .",
    "thus , each vertex of @xmath64 is in @xmath51 .",
    "suppose now a pair @xmath61 , with @xmath78 , n \\geq 1 $ ] , is an n - simplex of @xmath64 .",
    "since the vertices of @xmath64 are in @xmath51 we can construct a commutative diagram of the form ( * * ) , wherein the diagonals correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these diagonals are equal , so @xmath79 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath64 is completely contained in @xmath51 showing that @xmath49 is cartesian with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this definition is a special case of definition 4.1 in @xcite for the galois structure @xmath2 .",
    "however , as mentioned in a.3.9(iii ) , @xcite by f. borceux and g. janelidze , it is equivalent to the definition of covering map of simplicial sets given in @xcite by p. gabriel and m. zisman , where a morphism of simplicial sets @xmath63 is said to be a covering map if and only if for each commutative square          a trivial covering of simplicial sets is a kan fibration . also , it is not difficult to see that for the galois structure @xmath9 , a square ( * ) is a pullback if @xmath53 is a trivial covering of simplicial sets . the  if \" part of the lemma is proved .",
    "conversely , if @xmath44 is cartesian with respect to @xmath9 , then , by definition , it is a kan fibration . in particular , the inverse image of each connected component @xmath64 of @xmath45 is either empty or surjectively mapped on @xmath64 by @xmath46 . if in addition to this @xmath46 is injective , then clearly it is a trivial covering of simplicial sets .      by lemma [ lemma ]",
    "the diagonal @xmath89 is cartesian with respect to @xmath9 if and only if it is cartesian with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "then , theorem [ teorema2 ] will follow from theorem [ teorema ] if we note that in a commutative diagram ( * * * ) where @xmath53 is a kan fibration a diagonal fill - in exists .",
