    "considerable attention has been paid to strongly correlated - electron systems in the study of high-@xmath3 superconductivity since anderson  @xcite proposed that its origin may be attributed to magnetic interactions induced by strong coulomb repulsion . in anderson",
    "s scenario , a mott insulating phase of an undoped cuprate is assumed to be the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state , composed of electron spin - singlet pairs , and these singlet pairs become charged superconducting pairs when the mott insulator is doped sufficiently .",
    "although many attempts have been made on lattice models of electrons with interactions , such as the hubbard model and the @xmath4-@xmath5 model , there is no definite answer to the question of whether this scenario is realized in these concrete microscopic models .",
    "these models are usually difficult to analyze theoretically , and exact results are limited except for one dimensional case where bethe ansatz is available .",
    "one of the exact results in two or more dimensions is obtained by brandt and giesekus  @xcite , who constructed the exact ground state of the hubbard model with infinitely large repulsive on - site interactions on a @xmath0-dimensional decorated hypercubic lattice .",
    "tasaki  @xcite generalized the brandt - giesekus model to a class of hubbard models on certain cell structures .",
    "he pointed out that the exact ground states in this class of models are regarded as rvb states .",
    "he also obtained the singlet pair correlation function on the tree lattice and discussed a possibility of long - range order associated with the singlet pairs and superconductivity . bares and lee  @xcite and yamanaka _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite treated one dimensional versions of the models and obtained various correlation functions , including the singlet pair correlation function .",
    "they found that all the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance and concluded that the system is in an insulating phase .",
    "there are no conclusive results about the occurrence ( or absence ) of superconductivity in the models in two or more dimensions .    for extended hubbard models including nearest - neighbor interactions in addition to the on - site interactions ,",
    "there are some exact results relevant to superconductivity .",
    "these results are based on the so - called @xmath6-pairing mechanism originally proposed by yang  @xcite . by using the @xmath6-pairing mechanism",
    "yang constructed eigenstates of the hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice and proved that these states , in which all electrons form the @xmath6-pairs , have off - diagonal long - range order and thus are superconducting .",
    "unfortunately , these eigenstates were shown not to be the ground states .",
    "but , essler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath6-pairing states become the exact ground states of an extended hubbard model with attractive on - site interactions .",
    "they also showed that the model with moderately repulsive on - site interactions has ground states in which part of electrons forms the @xmath6-pairs .",
    "possibilities of superconductivity due to the @xmath6-pairing mechanism were discussed in other related models , in particular , in one dimensional systems .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite and references therein for more information .",
    "another rigorous result is a theorem on the hubbard model with attractive on - site interactions on bipartite lattices due to s .- q .",
    "shen and z .- m .",
    "qiu  @xcite .",
    "they proved that these models exhibit off - diagonal long - range order in the ground states .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for related results .    at the present time , to draw an exact result about superconductivity in the hubbard model with on - site repulsion or the @xmath4-@xmath5 model seems to be a formidably difficult task , but we have a chance to obtain one in extended hubbard models .",
    "although these exactly solvable models have somewhat artificial aspects , they will give us some insight into mechanisms for the phenomenon .",
    "in this paper , motivated by this viewpoint , we propose a new exactly solvable model of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it is based on a two dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model , a tight binding model of electrons with on - site interactions on the decorated square lattice corresponding to the cuo@xmath2 plane .",
    "the present new model has the infinitely large repulsive interactions on cu - sites and furthermore contains correlated - hopping , pair - hopping and attractive charge - charge interactions of electrons . for even numbers of electrons we obtain the exact ground states of the model .",
    "a mechanism used to construct the ground states is similar to @xmath6-pairing mechanism , but an electron - pair used here is different from @xmath6-pair .",
    "our electron - pair consists of singlet pairs of electrons on the same o - site , on the nearest - neighbor pair of the cu - sites , and on the nearest - neighbor pair of the cu- and o - sites .",
    "the constructed exact ground states are expressed as a linear combination of products of these singlet pairs and thus are regarded as rvb states .",
    "we also show that these ground states exhibit off - diagonal long - range order , which allow us to construct a ground state with explicit electron - number symmetry breaking .",
    "the recent experimental results of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite suggested that electron - phonon coupling is important in high-@xmath7 superconductors and thus a microscopic theory should include this effect .",
    "although this fact does not immediately justify an addition of artificial interactions to a model hamiltonian , we think that it is important to know what kind of electron - electron interaction , whichever of coulomb repulsion or electron - phonon coupling ( or others ) induces this , may stabilize a superconducting state in a theoretical point of view .",
    "we hope that our results will be useful in a future study .    in the next section",
    "we define the model and state the main result as a theorem . in section  [ s :",

    "we denote by @xmath31 the number of electrons in @xmath8 and by @xmath32 a state with no electrons .",
    "we assume that repulsive interactions between electrons on @xmath10-sites are infinitely large and that each of these sites is at most singly occupied .",
    "so we consider the hilbert space @xmath33 spanned by the linearly independent states of the form @xmath34 with arbitrary subsets @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . here",

    "we also introduce operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then , by using these operators , we define @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are real parameters , and @xmath53 denotes the spin opposite to @xmath23 . the projection operator @xmath54 which eliminates states with doubly occupied @xmath10-sites is defined by @xmath55 with @xmath56    the hamiltonian @xmath57 is rewritten as @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( see fig .

    "here we used the operator identities  @xcite @xmath79 and @xmath80 operator identities ( [ eq : identity2 ] ) and ( [ eq : identity3 ] ) follow from straightforward calculations , and ( [ eq : identity1 ] ) is derived by using @xmath81 and @xmath82 which also follow from simple calculations .",

    "the other terms can be rewritten into similar forms and interpreted as attractive and magnetic interactions as well .",
    "our model says that attractive magnetic interactions between localized states together with the strong on - site repulsion can stabilize the condensed rvb states consisting of local singlet pairs .",
