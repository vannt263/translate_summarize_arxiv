    "formaldehyde , h@xmath6co , is a poisonous molecule in the aldehyde group . on earth",
    "it plays a part in troposphere chemistry dynamics as the main source of oh via photo - dissociation and is formed from photo - oxidation in the atmosphere or through the incomplete burning of biomass @xcite .",
    "traces of formaldehyde have tentatively been detected in the martian atmosphere @xcite where it is believed to be derived from the oxidation of methene ( c@xmath7h@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde was the first polyatomic molecule to be detected in the interseller medium ( ism ) @xcite and is extremely abundant @xcite .",
    "this has made it useful in investigating the isotope composition of carbon in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the proposed mechanism of production is via the successive hydrogenation of co @xcite on icy grain mantles : @xmath9 further hydrogenation produces methanol through an intermediate methyl radical h+h@xmath7co@xmath10 ch@xmath11o@xmath10 h+ ch@xmath11o @xmath10 ch@xmath11oh .",
    "common reactions include that with ammonia which produces amines @xcite and polymerisation with other h@xmath7co molecules . as a result",
    ", formaldehyde is believed to be the major precursor for the formation of complex organic molecules in the ism that include interstellar glycolaldehyde @xcite and amino acids @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde s astrophysical relevance does not end in the ism .",
    "recently , it has been detected in comets @xcite , such as 103p / hartley 2 @xcite , c/2007 n3@xcite and hale - bopp @xcite , where it is thought to originate from the degredation of polyoxymethylene @xcite .",
    "it is also present in protoplanetary discs around low mass young stars ( taurus - auruga class i / ii ) @xcite as circumstellar ice with an abundance ratio of @xmath12 compared to the more ubiquitous water - ice .",
    "because of h@xmath7co s role as a precursor to complex organic molecules , it is considered a possible biomarker .",
    "the rna world hypothesis suggests an early earth with a co@xmath7 , h@xmath7o and n@xmath7 rich atmosphere @xcite . illuminating this mix with ultraviolet ( uv )",
    "radiation should lead to a large amount of formaldehyde being fixed in the atmosphere before being deposited into the prebiotic oceans @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the source of prebiotic chemical compounds may be derived without need of illuminating uv radiation via glancing icy body impacts @xcite .",
    "such impacts would produce shock - compression conditions that lead to formation of hcn molecules .",
    "these hcn molecules can be hydrolyzed to form formaldehyde and from there produce amino acids .",
    "thus a planet rich in formaldehyde may indicate one undergoing the stages of pre - life .",
    "finally , formaldehyde masers @xcite are a reliable and proven tracer for high - density environments such as star - forming regions in galaxies due to its ubiquity and large number of long wavelength transitions @xcite .",
    "currently , there are 19 extragalactic sources @xcite of these masers including iras 18566 + 0408 , which is notable for detection of the first h@xmath7co maser flare @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde masers ( and maser flares ) have mostly been observed via the @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15-doublet transitions at 6.1 cm and 2.2 cm respectively",
    ". the wide - range of interactions in atmospheric , terrestrial , astrophysical and astrobiological phenomena makes formaldehyde a relevant molecule in the chemistry of exoplanets and their atmospheres .",
    "therefore a complete , high - resolution , line list for h@xmath7co should provide an important aid for characterisation and modelling of formaldehyde .",
    "these considerations led us to study formaldehyde as part of the exomol project @xcite , which aims to produce comprehensive molecular line lists for studies of the atmospheres of exoplanets and cool stars .",
    "high - resolution , room - temperature formaldehyde spectra have been well - studied in the laboratory @xcite ; the early work was reviewed by @xcite . currently , the major source of publicly available spectroscopic data on h@xmath7co is the hitran database @xcite which has recently been updated to include long - wavelength data from the cdms database @xcite .",
    "the spectral regions covered in the database are 0  100 @xmath4 , 1600  1800 @xmath4 @xcite and the 2500  3100 @xmath4 @xcite at up to 10@xmath16 cm / molecule sensitivity for @xmath17=296 k. however , this accounts for only 40  000 transitions extending up to @xmath18 and covers only four of the six fundamental vibrational bands as well as the ground state rotational spectrum .",
    "this deficiency arises from an apparent lack of absolute intensities in the 100  1600 @xmath4 range .",
    "additional observed transitions are available @xcite and include line positions @xcite , and intensities @xcite of some of the fundamental bands and hot bands @xcite .",
    "the incompleteness and low rotational excitations available in hitran limits the applicability of this data for temperatures above 300 k. the theoretical spectra presented in this paper aims to provide a more complete and accurate picture of the spectra of formaldehyde up to 10  000 @xmath4 and for temperatures up to 1500 k. our line list should therefore be useful for modelling higher temperature environments as well as studies on non - lte transitions such as those observed in masers .    theoretically , electric dipole transition intensities of h@xmath7co were studied by @xcite and @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite .",

    "coriolis interactions occur strongly between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 modes , and weakly between the @xmath27 and @xmath25 modes @xcite which couples their energy levels and wavefunctions .",

    "the rms error against experimental energy levels with @xmath38 of this semi - empirical pes , called h2co-2011 , is 0.04 @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted however that the excellent accuracy of the refined pes caused serious problems with the absolute intensities of some bands .",
    "the intensities based on the initial , less accurate _ ab initio _  pes , the intensities of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands were observed to agree much better with the experiment .",

    "initially blamed on the dms , it was soon discovered that the original _ ab initio _",
    "pes did not have this problem .    in order to address this issue",
    "we have repeated the refinement process making it less aggressive with careful observation of the transition moments . in the present work",
    "we have also increased the size of the basis set ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we used the same fitting set of experimental energies as well as the same functional form for pes .",

    "trove is designed to compute variational ro - vibrational energy levels , associated eigenfunctions and transition intensities for molecules of arbitrary structure .",
    "variational methods are often limited in their efficiency due to the need to diagonalize increasingly large hamiltonian matrices as the complexity of the molecule increases .",
    "however with the improved computational power and parallelism of modern cpus , it is now feasible to solve ro - vibrational schrdinger equations for polyatomic molecules .",
    "trove has been successfully used to produce high - accuracy line lists and spectra for tetratomic molecules such as hsoh @xcite , nh@xmath11 @xcite , so@xmath11 @xcite , ph@xmath11 @xcite , and sbh@xmath11  @xcite , as well as recently the pentatomic molecule ch@xmath43  @xcite .    trove approximates the kinetic energy operator ( keo ) by a truncated taylor series expansion in generalized coordinates .",
    "previous calculations for h@xmath7o@xmath7 by @xcite show that computations using series representation of the keo for non - linear molecules , such as h@xmath7co , converge as well as exact keo - based programs such as wavr4 @xcite and , particularly for excited rotational states , at cost of significantly less computational time . in this work",
    "we use a kinetic expansion order of @xmath44 for optimal convergence while providing reasonable computation times and similarly , we use a potential energy expansion order of @xmath45 .    in trove , the primitive vibrational basis set is represented by a symmetrized product of six one - dimensional vibrational functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the associated local mode vibrational quanta , @xmath53 are linearized versions  @xcite of the coordinates @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively , and @xmath56 is the dihedral angle between the och@xmath57 and och@xmath6 planes .",
