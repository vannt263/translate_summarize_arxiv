    "the knowledge of the very high - energy ( vhe ; e @xmath0100  gev ) sky has greatly improved during the last few years , thanks to the high sensitivity of current imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , e.g. h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas .",
    "at lower energies , observations using @xmath1-ray satellites like _ cgro_/egret , _ agile _ , and _ fermi_/lat represent the dominant efforts in the field of high - energy @xmath1-ray astronomy .    funk et al .",

    "sources within the region of @xmath230@xmath3 to 30@xmath3 , @xmath43@xmath3 to 3@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "they did not find spatial correlation between the two populations .",
    "however , due to the capabilities of the egret experiment , this study suffers from the following limitations : ( 1 ) the sensitivity of egret is relatively poor .",
    "the lack of photon statistics leads to poor - constrained spectral indices and the spectra end @xmath510  gev at the upper end for a typical source ; ( 2 ) egret sources are only localized to degree - scales , which is much larger than the angular resolution of iacts .",
    "these disadvantages are now largely improved by the better performance of lat over egret .    in february 2009 , the _",
    "fermi_/lat bright source list ( bsl ) was released  @xcite . in this work",
    ", vhe counterparts detected using iacts of each source in this list are searched for based on spatial coincidence , and the gev to tev spectra of several selected coincident sources are depicted .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2009a ) present 205 point - like @xmath1-ray sources detected in the @xmath6  gev band based on three months of observations ( august  4 , 2008 ",
    "october  30 , 2008 ) .",
    "the authors assign for each source a source class , as well as @xmath1-ray and lower energy association ( if any ) .",
    "those sources that are classified as extragalactic ( all agn and the large magellanic cloud ) are not considered below .",
    "most of the lat bright sources studied in this work are , therefore , of galactic origin .",
    "the remaining source list contains 83 sources , that consists of 15 radio / x - ray pulsars , 15 new pulsars discovered using lat , 2 high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , one globular cluster ( 47 tuc ) , 13 snr / pwn candidates , and 37 sources without obvious counterparts at lower energy bands ( unids ) @xcite .",
    "the number of vhe @xmath1-ray sources is larger than 50  @xcite .",
    "the vhe @xmath1-ray source positions and source extension in this work are taken from the corresponding publications . at higher energies , the milagro collaboration reported evidence of multi - tev emission from several lat source positions  @xcite . only those source candidates with significance larger than five are regarded as tev sources here . with several tens of known sources in both the gev and tev bands , a systematic cross - correlation study is conducted .",
    "to quantify the level of spatial coincidence , the following scheme is employed .",
    "let @xmath7 be the distance between a lat best - fit centroid position and a nearby vhe source centroid position .",
    "the radius of 95% confidence region for the lat source is the uncertainty on the centroid position of the given lat source , which is typically @xmath8 .",
    "most vhe sources are extended , with a typical extension of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the sum of the radius of 95% confidence region and the source extension of the vhe source .    for each lat source ,",
    "if a vhe source was found where @xmath11 , the source pair is called a spatial coincidence case ( i.e. category _ y _  yes ) .",
    "given a possible extended nature of many lat bright sources , so that the sources seen by lat and vhe instrument may actually overlap with each other , a category _",
    "( for possible ) is defined for pairs where @xmath12 .",
    "if no reported vhe source was found with @xmath13 : the lat source falls into the coincidence level _",
    "( for no coincidence with any vhe source ) . if there are several nearby vhe sources , only the closest vhe source would be considered .      in the search",
    ", 23 coincident cases ( y , among them three are coincident with milagro source only ) and 5 possibly - coincident cases ( p ) are found .",
    "the results are presented in tables  [ tab : pos_coincidence1 ] , [ tab : pos_coincidence2 ] , and [ tab : pos_coincidence3 ] .",
    "no reported vhe sources are found in the remaining 55 sources , as of october 2009 .    .0fgl",
    "sources with spatially coincident vhe counterpart .",
    "psr : pulsars ; snr / pwn : supernova remnants / pulsar wind nebulae candidates ; unid : unidentified sources ; hmxb : high - mass x - ray binaries . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this study , that largely benefits from the better angular resolution and better sensitivity of lat over its predecessors including egret , for the first time , reveals a correlation between the gev / tev populations .",
    "the high fraction of _ fermi _ bright sources spatially coincident with a vhe counterpart can not be a chance coincidence .",
    "this means that there exists a common gev / tev source population . on the other hand ,",
    "a single spectral component is unable to describe some sources detected in both gev and tev energies .",
    "two spectral components may be needed in these sources to accommodate the spectral energy distribution in @xmath1-rays .",
