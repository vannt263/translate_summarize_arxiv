    "the miniboone collaboration , which studies the interactions of neutrinos from the @xmath6 decays in flight at fnal , has observed an excess of low energy electron - like events in the energy distribution of charge - current quasi - elastic electron neutrino events @xcite .",
    "this anomaly has been recently further confirmed with larger statistics @xcite .",
    "as the collaboration has not yet clarified the origin of the excess , several models involving new physics were considered to explain the discrepancy , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well known , that the neutrino weak flavor eigenstates ( @xmath7 ) need not coincide with the mass eigenstates ( @xmath8 ) , but would , in general , be related through a unitary transformation .",
    "such a generalized mixing : @xmath9 results in neutrino oscillations when the mass differences are small , and in decays of heavy neutrinos when the mass differences are large .     calculated for @xmath10 in the model of ref .",
    "the rectangular area represents the region in parameter space favorable for the suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite explanation of the miniboone anomaly .",
    "[ mix ] ]    in the recent work @xcite it has been shown that the miniboone excess could be explained by the production of a sterile neutrinos , @xmath0 s , of the mass around @xmath11 500 mev , which , being created by mixing in @xmath12 neutral - current interactions , decay ( dominantly ) into photons and light neutrinos in the miniboone detector target .",
    "such kind of @xmath0 could arise in many interesting extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as guts , superstring inspired models , left - right symmetric models , and others .",
    "it can decay radiatively into @xmath13 , if e.g. there is a non - zero transition magnetic moment ( @xmath14 ) between the @xmath0 and active neutrino @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the required mixing strength @xmath16 was found to be consistent with existing experimental data for @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 is the bohr magneton ) @xcite . for illustration ,",
    "experimentally allowed region of the mixing strength @xmath19 in the @xmath0 mass range around 500 mev is shown in fig .",
    "[ mix ] for @xmath20 together with the parameter region favorable for the explanation of the miniboone anomaly .",
    "it worth to mention that the model @xcite is also consistent with the absence of a significant low - energy excess in miniboone antineutrino data @xcite .    in this letter we put forward an idea that sterile - active neutrino mixing in the allowed range shown in fig .",
    "[ mix ] could be tested by searching for the admixtures of @xmath0 in the decay @xmath2 .",
    "in addition we point out that the present discrepancy of about 3@xmath21 between the measured and predicted decay rate of @xmath2 could be explained by the unrecognized contribution from the decay @xmath3 .",
    "if the @xmath0 exists , it could be a component of @xmath12 , and as follows from eq .",
    ", would be produced by any source of @xmath12 according to the mixing @xmath22 and kinematic constraints .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 could be produced in any leptonic and semileptonic decays of sufficiently heavy mesons and baryons .",
    "for the interesting mass range @xmath23  mev the most promising process is the leptonic decay @xmath2 .    in the sm , @xmath24 meson decays leptonically via annihilation of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks through a virtual @xmath27 .",
    "the decay rate of this process is given by @xmath28 where the @xmath29 is the @xmath30 meson mass , @xmath31 is the mass of the charged lepton , @xmath32 is the decay constant , @xmath33 is the fermi constant , and @xmath34 is a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element which value equals 0.97334 @xcite .",
    "the decay rate is suppressed by the lepton mass squared , since the very leptonic decay is due to chirality - flip .",

    "consider now , as an example , the cleo - c experiment , where the search for the decay @xmath3 could be performed . in this experiment",
    "several of the most precise measurements of properties of @xmath41 mesons have been performed by using the cleo - c detector at cesr @xcite .",
    "recently , the cleo collaboration studying the process @xmath42 has reported on measurements of the decay constant @xmath43 of @xmath24 mesons to a precision of a few % @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the detector is well equipped to identify and measure the momenta / energy and directions of charged particles and photons .",
    "the experiment was performed at a centre - of - mass energy of 4170  mev , where the cross section of a charmed meson pair production is relatively large .",
    "this allowed to fully reconstruct the @xmath44 as a tag and study the leptonic decay properties of the other through the decay chains @xmath45 the decays @xmath2 were identified by selecting the events with a single missing massless neutrino , for which the missing mass - squared , @xmath46 , evaluated by taking into account the reconstructed @xmath47 and @xmath48 should peak at zero .",
    "the @xmath46 is calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the centre - of - mass energy and 3-momentum , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy and 3-momentum of the fully reconstructed @xmath44 tag , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the energy and 3-momentum of the photon and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energy and 3-momentum of the muon @xcite .    similarly to this approach , the basic idea of probing the model under discussion is to search for a peak corresponding to the value @xmath58 in the @xmath46 distribution .",
    "it should be calculated taking into account measured properties of observed @xmath59 and photon from the decay chains : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes a photon from the dominant decay mode @xmath62 of sterile neutrino . in the largest part of the ( @xmath63 ) parameter space favored by miniboone , the @xmath0",
    "is expected to be a short - lived particle with the lifetime less than @xmath64  s @xcite .",
    "then , its decay length is significantly less than the radius of the cleo detector ( 95 cm ) , and most of the @xmath62 decays would occur inside the cleo - c detector fiducial volume in the vicinity of the primary vertex .",
    "the experimental signature of the decay @xmath62 is a peak in the mass range @xmath65  gev@xmath66 of the distribution of . using eqs . , and the total number of @xmath67 @xmath68 events observed by cleo - c with 600 pb@xmath69 @xcite",
    ", @xmath70 events are expected to be found at the peak . to obtain the correct @xmath46 value ,",
    "the photon from the decay @xmath62 should not be used in calculations of eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) . for the energy greater than threshold , @xmath71 mev , the @xmath61",
    "could be identified as an extra photon in the event candidate for the decay chains ( [ chain1 ] ) .",
    "finally , note that a search for the decay mode @xmath72 is also of a special interest .",
    "although this decay is sub - dominant , for the mixing as large as in eq .",
    "( [ ran1 ] ) its branching fraction could be of the order of few % @xcite , and a few events could be observed in the cleo - c experiment for the 600 pb@xmath69 of data .",
    "the experimental signature of the event @xmath72 would be two charged tracks originated from a common vertex displaced from the primary vertex . since there is no neutrino in the final state , it is possible to reconstruct the invariant mass of the heavy sterile neutrino , that would manifest itself as a peak in the range 0.16 - 0.36 gev@xmath66 of the invariant mass squared .",
    "an observation of a few @xmath73-events with the same invariant mass would provide an excellent cross - check of the model .",
    "interestingly , the above discussions might be relevant to the discrepancy of about 3@xmath21 between the measured and predicted rates of @xmath2 , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and discussion therein .",
    "presently , in spite of the substantial theoretical and experimental efforts , the decay rates of @xmath2 measured by the cleo - c @xcite , belle @xcite , and babar @xcite experiments are found to be slightly higher than the predicted one , most accurately calculated in the framework of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "taking into account the most precise results on the @xmath2 decay rate from these experiments one arrives at @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the average measured and predicted values for the @xmath2 decay rate , respectively , with the statistical and systematical uncertainties combined in quadrature .",
    "thus , the ratio of eq .   differs from zero by about 2.8@xmath21 standard deviations .",
    "various models of new physics giving additional contribution to the rate of @xmath2 have been investigated in order to resolve the discrepancy , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we propose here that the reason of why the experimental rate of @xmath2 is higher than the theoretical expectations may be due the contribution from the decay @xmath3 .",
    "consider again , as an example , search for @xmath2 events in the cleo experiment @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath61 from the decay chain ( [ chain2 ] ) is used , the calculated @xmath46 should peak at zero regardless of wether or not the @xmath61 is produced in the direct @xmath41 decay .",
    "this is valid under assumption that the @xmath15 from the @xmath62 decay is light .",
    "thus , the events ( [ chain2 ] ) may be accepted and contribute to the number of the @xmath2 signal events . using eqs .",
    "( [ rate1],[rate3],[disc ] ) one finds that in order to explain the discrepancy the branching fraction of decay mode to sterile neutrinos of masses @xmath78  mev should be within the range @xmath79 where factor @xmath80 is the ratio of the overall probabilities for the events ( [ chain2 ] ) and ( [ chain1 ] ) to pass selection criteria in the analysis of @xmath2 events in @xcite . in this search , for the selection of @xmath2 candidates",
    "it was required that there should be no additional photon , not associated with the tag , detected in the ecal with energy greater than 300 mev ( photon veto ) @xcite .",
    "the fraction of @xmath61 from ( [ chain2 ] ) that would pass this veto cut is roughly estimated to be @xmath81 .",
    "this results in @xmath82 the corresponding mixing strength is ( c.f . and ) @xmath83 the explanation of the miniboone anomaly implies somewhat smaller contribution to the decay @xmath2 .",
    "however , the regions for the obtained mixing strength of eq .   and branching fraction of eq .   overlap at the level of less than 2 @xmath21 with the ranges of eqs .   and , respectively , required to explain the miniboone anomaly , see also fig .",
    "this enhances motivation for a sensitive search of the decay @xmath3 .    in close analogy with the case of @xmath41 , the mixing",
    "can also be probed with study of the leptonic decay rates of the @xmath84-meson . in particular",
    ", our model implies the quite similar to contribution to the total muonic decay rate of @xmath85 .",
    "however , the achieved accuracy in measurement of this decay rate @xcite is worse than that for the @xmath24-meson , hence the suggested new contribution is unrecognizable yet .",
    "it should be mentioned that the best precision in measurements of the decay rate of @xmath5 has aslo been achieved at cleo  @xcite , and the result is consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "however from other measurements at cleo  @xcite , based on study of another decay mode of outgoing @xmath86-lepton , the obtained decay rate of @xmath5 is significantly higher than the predicted one , so that combined branching ratio deviates from the theoretical prediction at the level comparable to eq .  .",
    "thus , one may speculate that this discrepancy is due to existence of an additional sterile neutrino coupled to the tau neutrino .",
    "similar to above consideration we found that the mixing strength required to explain @xmath5 discrepancy should be @xmath87 for the mass range much below 190 mev , where phase space suppression is negligible .",
    "note , that this result is consistent with direct experimental limits @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that heavy sterile neutrino of mass about 500  mev and mixing to muon neutrino as strong as , can be searched in other decays of charmed hadrons , beauty hadrons and @xmath86-leptons .",
    "pure leptonic modes are more promising , since heavy neutrino contribution is enhanced with respect to that of the sm by a squared mass ratio of sterile neutrinos and charged lepton .",
    "this is not the case for other decay modes which branching ratios are roughly the same as corresponding decay to active muon neutrino multiplied by @xmath88 , and somewhat suppressed due to reduced phase space volume . by making use of general formulae for meson and @xmath86-lepton",
    "decays to sterile neutrinos presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and similar formulae for baryons @xcite one can obtain more accurate estimates .",
    "to summarize , we show that the recently suggested explanation  @xcite of the miniboone anomaly  @xcite can be probed by studying leptonic decays of charmed mesons .",
    "this study can be undertaken with already collected data .",
    "we speculate that the present 2.8 @xmath21 discrepancy between the measured and predicted rate of @xmath2 can be a hint at the presence of heavy sterile neutrino suggested in ref.@xcite .",
