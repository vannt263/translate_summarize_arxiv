[ ! ]",
    "in order to further increase the luminosity , we can either increase the bunch intensity or reduce @xmath2 . a low-@xmath2 lattice increases the @xmath27 functions in the triplet quadrupoles , and",
    "therefore the particles will sample large non - linear magnetic field errors at these locations . as a result",
    ", the dynamic aperture will be reduced  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the 2009 100  gev p - p run , we used a lattice with @xmath48  m , which gave a short beam lifetime  @xcite . at 250  gev",
    ", we achieved @xmath49  m. the reason is that the transverse beam size is smaller at 250  gev than at 100  gev  @xcite .",
    "a low-@xmath2 lattice also increases the non - linear chromaticity and reduces the off - momentum dynamic aperture .",
    "chromatic analysis shows that the non - linear chromaticities are mostly originating from the low-@xmath27 insertions ir6 and ir8  @xcite .",
    "the non - linear chromaticities increase dramatically with the decreased @xmath2 .",
    "figure  13 shows the calculated second- and third - order chromaticities as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "large second - order chromaticities push the particles with large momentum errors to the third- or 10th - order resonances .",
    "several correction techniques for non - linear chromaticities have been tested and implemented in the rhic  @xcite . to further reduce @xmath2",
    ", we need to balance the hourglass effect , beam lifetime reduction , and the luminosity increase .     in the p - p runs.,width=264 ]     and @xmath50 in ir8 in the yellow ring , based on the offline non - linear ir model.,width=264 ]          to mitigate the coupling between two beams , we would like to mirror the working points of the two rhic rings on both sides of the diagonal in the tune space .",
    "however , in the operation we had to operate with both working points below the diagonal for better beam lifetimes .",
    "it was understood in the 2006 100  gev p - p run that the strong @xmath52 resonances at @xmath53 prevented a working point above the diagonal  @xcite . at that time , the proton bunch intensity was @xmath54 .    in the 2012 100  gev",
    "run , even with both working points below the diagonal , when the bunch intensity was higher than @xmath20 , we observed a larger beam loss due to the @xmath55 resonance , which is located at @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the main contributions to the third - order resonances are from the sextupole and skew sextupole components in ir6 and ir8 . as an example , fig .",
    "14 shows @xmath57 and @xmath50 in ir8 in the yellow ring . to reduce the resonance stop - bands , we routinely correct the local sextupole and skew sextupole errors with ir orbit bumps by minimizing the feed - down tune shifts  @xcite , which improved the beam losses experimentally .",

    "beam simulation shows that there is a wider tune space with good dynamic apertures than the working point ( 0.695 , 0.685 )  @xcite .",
    "the spin simulation shows that there are weaker spin depolarization resonances in this region as well .    however , operating at near - integer tunes turned out to be very challenging  @xcite . with such tunes",
    ", we found that it was difficult to correct the closed orbit and to control the @xmath27-beat .",
    "moreover , both detectors reported high background rates from the beam in the blue ring when two beams were brought into collision .",
    "these backgrounds were caused by horizontal orbit vibrations around 10  hz , which originated from mechanical vibrations of the low-@xmath27 triplets driven by the cryogenic flow  @xcite .",
    "we were able to correct the 10  hz orbit oscillations in the 2011 p - p run by developing a local 10  hz orbit feedback system  @xcite .",
    "figure 15 shows an example of horizontal beam position monitor ( bpm ) readings in the triplet without and with the 10  hz orbit feedback .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of the 10  hz orbit oscillation was reduced by the feedback system from 2500  @xmath58 m down to 250  @xmath58 m .",
