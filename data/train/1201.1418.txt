    "the stability of quantum evolution against parametric changes of the quantum hamiltonian is a subject of wide theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "a widely used concept is the fidelity introduced by peres @xcite , and the closely related loschmidt echo @xcite , which is built as the interference pattern between states which are obtained by propagating the same initial state under hamiltonians , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are slight perturbations of each other .",
    "a standard definition of the fidelity is : @xmath2 the behavior of fidelity in time is known to display some universal properties that reflect the underlying classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "such properties have been mostly explored for the case of systems , which are chaotic in the classical limit . in this paper",
    "we will study the fidelity in the mixed phase space regime .",
    "for this the system under consideration is the quantum kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for our analysis here is twofold .",
    "firstly , there has been a growing interest over the last decade in the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor ( and its variants ) at and close to the so - called quantum resonances @xcite , theoretically ( see , e.g , @xcite ) as well as experimentally ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . secondly , only recently concepts have been developed to actually access the fidelity in setups based on cold or ultracold quantum gases .",
    "the used techniques range from interferometric methods in either internal atomic states @xcite or in the center - of - mass motion of the atoms @xcite to the time reversal of the dynamics by exploiting the properties of the quantum resonant motion @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the quantum kicked rotor under the additional influence of a stark or gravity field @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sectqkr ] the hamiltonian of one kicked atom is quickly reminded and the fidelity , which is the main quantity studied here , is precisely defined for our system .",
    "we then report on a subtle dependence of the fidelity on the arithmetic properties of the relevant parameters ( sect .",
    "[ sectqr ] ) , a result which may be interesting for future precise measurements of fundamental constants ( see the discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . sect .",

    "@xcite , we explain the overall behavior of the fidelity using @xmath3classical phase space densities and quantum tunneling rates from the stable resonance island to the surrounding chaotic sea in phase space .",
    "some technical details are found in appendices .",
    "we are interested in the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in a line , periodically kicked in time , and subject to a constant stark or gravity field .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian in dimensionless variables ( such that @xmath4 ) @xcite : @xmath5 the kicking period is @xmath6 , the kicking strength is @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a discrete time variable that counts the number of kicks .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 yields the change in momentum produced by the constant field in one kicking period . in the accelerated frame of reference @xcite ,",
    "the potential experienced by the particle is periodic in space and so the quasi - momentum @xmath10 is conserved by the evolution . with the chosen units , @xmath10 takes all values between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . using bloch theory ,",
    "the particle dynamics can then be identified with that of a family of quantum rotors , labelled by the values of @xmath10 . for the @xmath10-rotor ( _ i.e. _ ,",

    "the time - dependent hamiltonian that generates the quantum evolution corresponding to ( [ u_tot ] ) is then : @xmath18 we will study the fidelity that measures the stability of the evolution ( [ u_tot ] ) with respect to changes of the parameter @xmath7 . for a given @xmath10-rotor this fidelity is defined by : @xmath19 moreover , having in mind experimental situations with cold atoms @xcite , we will also consider the case when the initial state of the atomic cloud is an incoherent mixture of plane waves with a distribution @xmath20 of the quasi - momentum . in this case the fidelity is given by @xcite : @xmath21",

    "( [ flqt ] ) describes the standard kicked - rotor ( kr ) dynamics , and so - called kr resonances @xcite occur whenever @xmath6 is commensurate to @xmath23 .",

    "here we study the behavior of fidelity in the presence of gravity and for the case of a main kr resonance , i.e. , @xmath25 ( with integer @xmath26 ) . denoting @xmath27 ,",
    "one may explicitly compute @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a global phase , and @xmath30 from now on we assume that the initial state is a plane wave : @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 the fidelity is directly obtained from ( [ psi_mom ] ) using the method described in @xcite .",
    "first write @xmath33 with @xmath34 then from ( [ psi_mom ] ) it follows that the wave function after the @xmath8-th kick is given in momentum representation by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bessel function of order @xmath37 . using this along with the addition formula of bessel functions ,",
    "see e.g. 7.15.(31 ) in @xcite , one finds : @xmath38 where we defined the perturbation parameter @xmath39 , and so the fidelity of a single @xmath40rotor is given by : @xmath41      from eqs .",

    "such facts have the following implications on wave packet dynamics on the one hand and on the behavior of the fidelity on the other hand .",
    "two cases have to be distinguished , according to whether @xmath65 is integer , or not . in the former case ,",

    "the initial sharp decay is due to the part of the initial wave packet that lies in the chaotic component of either of the two dynamics ( defined by the two different kick strengths ) , and is rapidly carried away . the fidelity is thereafter dominated by the parts of the wave packet which are trapped inside the islands . for this reason , in order to bring this stage of fidelity decay into full light , we choose our initial state in the form of a gaussian state mostly located inside one island .",
    "the islands which correspond to the @xmath113 and to the @xmath114 dynamics are slightly displaced with respect to each other , however they travel in momentum space with the same velocity ( [ constv ] ) .",

    "the main contribution to fidelity comes from the part of each factor in the scalar product in ( [ fid_def1rot ] ) which is trapped in the respective travelling island .",
