    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are important high energy sources .",
    "not only are they thought to be the major source of galactic cosmic rays of energies up to at least @xmath1  ev , they are , until a supernova occurs in the galaxy , also the only galactic sources with which can get a direct view on supernova explosions and nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , snrs are sources in which interesting physical processes take place , some of which can now be spatially or spectroscopically resolved with the current generation of high spatial and spectral resolution x - ray telescopes , _",
    "chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_.",
    "that the hot plasma of snrs that we observe with x - ray telescopes exists is somewhat of a surprise .",
    "the reason is that snr shocks take place in the tenuous interstellar medium , with typical densities of @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "two body atomic collisions in such a medium are so rare that , were it not for the generation of plasma waves , plasmas could move through each other without hardly any noticeable interaction .",
    "because of this lack of two body collisions ( coulomb interactions ) snr shocks are called collisionless .",
    "the small collision rates in snrs has two consequences .",
    "one of them , non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , has been well established since the eighties ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for an introduction ) .",
    "snr plasma are usually in nei , meaning that the plasma has not yet have time to reach ionization equilibrium .",
    "in other words the plasma is still ionizing .",
    "nei plasmas are usually characterized by the parameter @xmath4 , i.e. the product of electron density and time .",
    "plasmas with temperatures of @xmath5@xmath6  kev are out of equilibrium when @xmath4@xmath7  @xmath3s .",
    "less well known is that the there is considerable uncertainty how collisionless plasmas are heated by shocks , and in particular whether this leads immediately downstream of the shock to equal temperatures for all particles ( electrons , ions ) involved .",
    "basic considerations , such as conservation of mass , momentum and energy , lead to the rankine - hugoniot relations , but it is not clear whether collisionless shock heating leads to equal temperatures for all particles , or whether it heats different plasma elements to different temperatures . in the latter case one expects that the temperature of each species is proportional to @xmath8 , with @xmath9  the particle mass and @xmath10  the shock speed .",
    "far downstream of the shock the particles will eventually equilibrate their energies .",
    "also the coulomb equilibration of electrons and ions is governed by the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "equilibration is reached when @xmath4@xmath7  @xmath3s .    over the last decade",
    "several observations in the optical @xcite , uv @xcite , and x - rays @xcite have been used to address this issue .",
    "they all rely on the fact that ion temperatures can be measured by observing thermal doppler broadenings . for snrs",
    "this can only be done for the limb brightened edges of the shells , because far inside the shell , bulk motions in the line of sight dominate the line broadening .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_sn1006 ] x - ray evidence is shown that for sn 1006 the ion temperature is much hotter , @xmath11  kev , than the electron temperature @xmath5@xmath12  kev .",
    "of course what is normally measured is the electron temperature , as this determines the x - ray continuum shape and emission line ratios .",
    "sn1006 is a very suitable target for such a study , as its plasma is very far out of equilibrium , @xmath13@xmath4@xmath14 .",
    "however , optical , h@xmath15 , measurements of line broadening do not rely on low @xmath4  values , as h@xmath15  emission only occurs very close to the shock front . using h@xmath15  measurements of several snrs ,",
    "@xcite have shown that slow equilibration of temperatures is probably a function of shock velocity or mach number , as only the fastest shocks appear to have substantial differences between electron and proton temperatures .",
    "one of the important findings of _ chandra _  concerning snrs was that with its ccd detectors it was able to pick out thin , non - thermal x - ray emitting filaments @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these filaments probably emit synchrotron emission , with electron energies @xmath16  tev .",
    "the narrow widths of these filaments are then best interpreted as the result of synchrotron losses .",
    "the reason is that the plasma downstream of the shock sweeps the relativistic particles away from the shock . at the same time",
    "the electrons rapidly lose energy , so that at some point away from the shock front the electrons only emit synchrotron radiation at energies below the x - ray band . for standard shock",
    "high mach number shocks the plasma velocity with respect to the shock front is given by @xmath17 .",
    "so for the width of the filaments one can write @xmath18 , with the synchrotron loss time given by @xmath19 . in order to disentangle the electron energy @xmath20 , and the average downstream magnetic field strength",
    "@xmath21  one has to use the fact that the peak photon energy as a result of synchrotron radiation is @xmath22  kev . fig .",
    "[ bfield ] shows graphically what for cas  a the possible values for @xmath21 and @xmath20 are .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic field is high @xmath23  @xmath24 g for casa , but also for other young snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is much stronger than might be expected if the magnetic is just the shock compressed mean galactic field .",
    "this may be surprising , but it is a nice confirmation of recent theoretical work that indicates that strong cosmic ray streaming close to fast snr shocks may lead to non - linear amplification of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in fact this solves a piece of the puzzle concerning cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "snrs were for a long time thought to be the most plausible sources of cosmic rays up to or beyond @xmath25  ev , at which energy the cosmic ray spectrum has a break .",
    "however , with only mean galactic magnetic field values snrs are not able to efficiently accelerate particles up to even @xmath26  ev @xcite .",
    "it looks now that _",
    "chandra _  has solved this problem .",
    "although , x - ray observations show that one necessary ingredient , large , turbulent magnetic fields are present ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is still no direct evidence that snrs accelerate also ions up to high energies .",
    "note that ions are the main ingredient of the cosmic rays that bombard the earth atmosphere .",
    "in that respect the many snrs that have been observed with cherenkov telescopes , in particular h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , are very promising .",
    "the reason is that collisions of relativistic ions result in the production of pions , and @xmath27  particles decay into two photons , giving rise to @xmath28-ray emission .",
    "however , also inverse compton scattering of background photons by relativistic electrons produces @xmath28-ray emission . in that case",
    "x - ray and cherenkov @xmath28-ray telescopes may observe the same electron cosmic ray population .",
    "it has not yet been resolved which mechanism is responsible for the @xmath28-ray emission from snrs .    ]",
    "the origin of cosmic rays may be an almost century old problem , but an equally fascinating , but more recent problem is the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "it is becoming more and more clear that long duration grbs are probably associated with core collapse supernovae of subclass type ibc @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism that generates the powerful relativistic jets that we observe as grbs is not well known .",
    "the collapsar model @xcite is one of the most popular models . in this model",
    "the stellar core collapses into a black hole that accretes matter , and generates jets .",
    "an alternative model is magneto - rotational jet formation @xcite .    in this light",
    "it is interesting that it was recently discovered that the bright galactic snr cas a seems to have exploded with a jet / counter jet .",
    "a normal x - ray image of cas a does not immediately reveal this , but dividing a narrow band image dominated by si xiii line emission by a narrow band image with mg xi line emission brings out a clear jet / counter jet structure ( fig .  [ jet ]",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra of the jet reveal an apparent absence of ne and mg .",
    "the dominant elements seem to be si , s , and ar , but some fe seems also present .",
    "the emission measure of the jet combined with the average velocity of the plasma suggest quite a high kinetic energy in the jet , @xmath29  erg , about 25% of the total explosion energy .",
    "so in terms of the total explosion energy the jets seem to contain as substantial , but not a dominant fraction of the energy .",
    "the jets seem not have been relativistic jets , like those of grbs .",
    "nevertheless , perhaps the same underlying mechanism produces both types of jets . in that respect",
    "it is interesting that cas a is likely the result of a type ib explosion , i.e. it belonged to the same supernova subclass with which grbs are associated .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the collapsar model in its present form is responsible for the jets in cas a , because there is the simple fact that the explosion appears to have resulted in the formation of a recently detected neutron star @xcite rather than a black hole .",
    "interestingly , not only the presence of a jet / counter jet makes cas a an interesting snr from the point of view of the explosion mechanism .",
    "equally interesting is that fe - rich knots seem to have been ejected with greater speed than the si - rich material synthesized further away from the core .",
    "this is clear from the presence of fe - rich knots in the southeast of the remnant , outside of the main si - rich shell @xcite .    in the north",
    "the fe is projected to the inside of the si - rich shell .",
    "however , this appears to be a projection effect , because the measured doppler velocities of fe in the north is higher than si @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how much of the fe in cas a is still unshocked , but some of the shocked fe must have been ejected with velocities of up to 7800  kms@xmath30 .",
    "there is no obvious symmetry to the fe - rich ejecta , so their emergence is probably related to hydrodynamical instabilities close to the core of the explosion @xcite .",
    "the 3d morphology of cas a as reconstructed from the doppler imaging obtained from _ xmm - newton _  gives further evidence that the explosion was from spherical 1@xcite .",
    "apart from the jets and fe - rich knots , the ejecta can best be described by a donut shape .",
    "this morphology also appears to describe best the high resolution spectroscopy data of the small magellanic cloud remnant 1e0102.2 - 7219 , obtained by the grating spectrometers of _ chandra",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "there is one other observational fact concerning cas a that may point to an intrinsically asymmetric explosion : the presence of @xmath31ti , which suggest a high initial @xmath31ti  yield of @xmath32  @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath31ti  is exclusively an explosive nucleosynthesis product , and is synthesized close to the core of the explosion .",
    "it is an alpha - rich freeze out product @xcite , and as such very sensitive to explosion energy and explosion asymmetries .",
    "the decay of @xmath31ti  ( @xmath34  yr ) is accompanied by three strong @xmath28-ray lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ti44 ] ) , which have been detected by _ cgro - comptel _   ( the 1157 kev line , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ bepposax _   ( the 68 and 78  kev lines , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the line emission is caused by radio - active decay makes that with @xmath31ti  we can also probe the unshocked @xmath31ti  ejecta .",
    "casa  is therefore a target of esa s @xmath28-ray observatory integral .",
    "preliminary results of the observations have been published in @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ti44 ] ) .",
    "core collapse supernovae obtain their energy from the gravitational potential energy released when the core of a massive star collapses .",
    "the classical view is that core collapse would either result in the creation of a radio pulsar with typical magnetic fields of @xmath35  g , or otherwise in the formation of a black hole .",
    "however , over the last decade it has become clear that some neutron stars appear to have very high magnetic fields , up to @xmath36  g. such neutron stars are called `` magnetars '' .",
    "it is thought that two classes of x - ray pulsars are manifestations of magnetars .",
    "depending on the presence or absence of ( soft ) @xmath28-ray flashed , these pulsars are either labeled soft - gamma - ray - repeaters ( sgrs ) , or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "it is not clear what causes the creation of a magnetar , but two mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "perhaps the most popular explanation is that magnetars are created during the core collapse of massive stars with a high angular momentum .",
    "this results in the formation of a proto - neutron star which rotates non - uniformly with an average rotation period close to the break up limit @xmath37  ms .",
    "this allows for the efficient operation of an @xmath38 dynamo , which rapidly amplifies the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "once the high magnetic field is in place , a magnetar will lose most of its angular momentum due to magnetic breaking in less than a few hunderd seconds ,",
    "i.e. during the supernova explosion self ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this means that most of the rotational energy will be rapidly pumped into the supernova ejecta .",
    "a neutron star with @xmath39  ms has a rotational energy of @xmath40  erg , which should be compared to an average core collapse supernova energy of @xmath40  erg .",
    "what interests us here is the fact that of the dozen or so magnetar candidates , three are associated with bright snrs : kes 73 , n49 , and ctb 109 .",
    "so one would expect that the kinetic energy of these snrs is exceptionally high , as the ejecta have been energized by the rapid spin down of the rapidly rotating magnetar .",
    "however , the kinetic energies of these snrs are unremarkable : a study of the energetics with _ xmm - newton_-epic spectroscopy reveals that the kinetic energies of kes 73 , n49 , and ctb 109 are resp .",
    "@xmath41  erg , @xmath42  erg , and @xmath43  erg ( vink & kuiper , 2005 , mnras submitted , and * ? ? ?",
    "this is far short of the @xmath44  erg expected if magnetars owe their existence to the operation of an @xmath38 dynamo @xcite .",
    "in fact one can put a lower limit on the initial spin period , by equating the observed snr energies to the initial rotational energy of the pulsar .",
    "this gives @xmath45  ms , which is closer to the classical initial spin period of radio pulsars , 10  ms , than to the break - up limit of a neutron star .",
    "so the unremarkable energies of snrs associated with magnetars imply that magnetars are the result of collapses of the cores of massive stars with high magnetic fields ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than from stars with a high angular momentum .",
    "i have shown that x - ray studies of snr provides us with important information on collisionless shock physics , cosmic ray acceleration and magnetic field amplification by snrs .    moreover , by studying snrs",
    "we can learn about the details of the supernova explosions that caused them .",
    "for example , the kinematics and spatial distribution of metals in cas a reveal that the explosion was intrinsically asymmetric , and was accompanied by the emergence of a jet / counter jet system .",
    "and i have discussed that the most remarkable property of snrs associated with magnetars is that they are unremarkable : their energies are similar to those of other snrs , which suggests that magnetars were _ not _ formed from proto - neutron stars with period close to 1  ms ."
