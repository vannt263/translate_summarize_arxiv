    "lehmann representation for the propagator of the unstable @xmath134 meson , smoothes the logarithmic singularities of the amplitude and hence makes the compensation of the contributions of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 intermediate states more strong .",
    "this results in both the diminishing of the calculated width of the decay @xmath143 by a number of times in comparison with the case of @xmath140 , and in the concentration of the main effect of the isospin breaking in the domain of the @xmath74 invariant mass between the @xmath20 thresholds .",
    "we also analyze the difficulties related with the assumption of the dominance of the @xmath147 decay mechanism and discuss the possible dynamics of the decay @xmath148 @xcite .",
