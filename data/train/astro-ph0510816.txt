    "over the past few years there has been a heightened interest in testing the statistical properties of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data .",
    "the process has been accelerated by the release of the wmap first year results .",
    "the wmap data provide the first ever , full - sky maps which are signal dominated up to scales of a few degrees .",
    "thus , for the first time we can test the gaussianity and isotropy assumptions of the cosmological signal over large scales in the sample variance limit .",
    "ever since the release of the cobe - dmr results @xcite a consensus has been hard to reach on tests of non - gaussianity with some studies reporting null results @xcite while others claimed detections of non - gaussian features @xcite . with the release of the wmap first year",
    "results a limit on the non - gaussianity of primordial perturbations in the form of an estimate of the non - linear factor @xmath2 was obtained by @xcite .",
    "however a number of authors @xcite have also reported analysis of the maps that suggest violations of the gaussian or isotropic nature of the signal .",
    "one of problems with testing gaussianity is that one can devise a plethora of tests to probe the infinite degrees of non - gaussianity , therefore different tests represent different perspectives on the statistical patterns of the signal . for wmap",
    "there are already a number of detections of so called anomalies , most pointing to different unexpected features in the microwave sky .",
    "the most documented case @xcite is the low amplitude of the quadrupole and octupole in comparison to the inflationary prediction , something we can categorize as _ amplitude anomalies_. although it is simple to design inflationary spectra with sharp features which reproduce , more or less closely , the amplitude anomaly ( see e.g. @xcite ) these invariably suffer fine tuning problems . another approach is to relate the anomaly to the breakdown of statistical isotropy or gaussianity .",
    "other reported features relate to the correlation of phases in the multipole coefficients which are an indication of non - gaussianity .",
    "these can be dubbed _",
    "phase anomalies_. one example is the hemisphere asymmetries @xcite ; the northern ecliptic hemisphere is practically flat while the southern hemisphere displays relatively high fluctuations in the power spectrum . other functions , such as the bispectrum @xcite and n - point correlation functions @xcite also show related asymmetries .",
    "furthermore , there is the anomalous morphology of several multipoles , in particular , the striking planarity of the quadrupole and octupole and the strong alignment between their preferred directions @xcite .",
    "overall , there is a strong motivation to continue probing the statistical properties of the data and find possible sources for these signals , be it instrumental , astrophysical or cosmological .    the first test to have provided indications of possible non - gaussian features in the cmb data",
    "was reported by @xcite and @xcite using a bispectrum estimator , the fourier analog of the three point function .",
    "both those detections were later found to be caused by systematic effects rather than by cosmological source as reported by @xcite .",
    "for the case of the bispectrum signal detected by @xcite , which used an estimator tuned to detect correlations between neighbouring angular scales , finding the source of the signal had to wait for the release of the high precision wmap data @xcite which was able to provide a comparative test of the cosmological signal .",
    "the wmap data did not reproduce cobe s result and systematic errors were found to be the cause @xcite .",
    "the wmap data was later analysed with the bispectrum in more detail by @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the bispectrum of the clean , coadded maps was analysed and a connection between the hemisphere asymmetries in the 3-point correlation function and the bispectrum was established , although the full sky as a whole was found to be consistent with gaussianity .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect that foreground contaminations have on bispectrum estimators . in section  [ sec : def ]",
    "we define a set of bispectrum estimators with set @xmath1 configurations . in section  [ sec : foregrounds ] we describe the template dust , free - free and synchrotron maps used to characterize the effect on the bispectrum . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we determine the distribution of the estimators in the presence of residual foregrounds with different amplitudes and discuss the application of this method to detect residuals in the data by introducing a number of statistical and correlation measures . in section  [ sec : application ] we discuss the application of the the statistical tools developed in the previous sections to the raw and cleaned wmap first year maps .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our method and results in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we now introduce the angular bispectrum estimator @xcite . the bispectrum is related to the third order moment of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath3 of a temperature fluctuation map @xmath4 .",
    "the coefficients describe the usual expansion of the map over the set of spherical harmonics @xmath5 as @xmath6    given a map , either in pixel space or harmonic space , and assuming statistical isotropy , one can construct a set hierarchy of rotationally invariant statistical quantities characterizing the pattern of fluctuations in the maps .",
    "these are the n - point correlation functions in the temperature fluctuations @xmath7 or in the spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath8 .",
    "the unique _ quadratic _ invariant is the angular power spectrum defined as @xmath9 , whose estimator can be written as @xmath10 .",
    "this gives a measure of the overall intensity for each multipole @xmath1 .",
    "following @xcite , the most general _ cubic _ invariant defines the angle averaged bispectrum , @xmath11 where the @xmath12 is the wigner @xmath13 symbol .",
    "parity invariance of the spherical harmonic functions dictates that the bispectrum be non - zero only for multipole combinations where the sum @xmath14 is even .",
    "an unbiased estimator ( for the full sky ) can be evaluated as @xmath15 with the normalization factor defined as @xmath16 the bispectrum can be related to the three - point correlation functions of the map just as the power spectrum @xmath17 can be related to the correlation function @xmath18 through the well known expression @xmath19 for example , the pseudo - collapsed , three - point correlation function , @xmath20 , is related to our definition of the bispectrum @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "it is important to use both tools , the bispectrum and the three - point correlation function , to probe the sky maps as they have the capacity to highlight different features of the data . in principle , harmonic space based methods are preferred for the study of primordial fluctuations whereas real space methods are more sensitive to systematics and foregrounds , which are strongly localized in real space .",
    "in addition , the three - point correlation function is intrinsically very sensitive to the low-@xmath1 modes , whereas the bispectrum can pick up different degrees of freedom with respect to the different mode correlations we want to probe    for the choice @xmath24 we can define the single-@xmath1 bispectrum @xmath25 @xcite , which probes correlations between different @xmath26 s .",
    "other bispectrum components are sensitive to correlations between different scales @xmath1 .",
    "this can be extended to study correlations from different angular scales .",
    "the simplest of these is the @xmath0 inter-@xmath1 bispectrum between neighbouring multipoles defined as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to consider estimators normalized by their expected gaussian variance @xmath28 which have been shown to be more optimal and more gaussian distributed than the unnormalized estimators , and are not sensitive to the overall power in the maps . here",
    "we will introduce the @xmath29,@xmath30 , and @xmath31 bispectra defined as @xmath32 and @xmath33 where have extended the formalism to a separation @xmath34 to probe signals with both odd and even parity in the inter-@xmath1 correlations .",
    "the standard method of foreground removal used by cosmologists makes use of a set of template maps for each of the dominant sources of foreground contamination in the cmb frequency maps .",
    "these are maps obtained from independent astronomical full - sky observations at frequencies where the respective mechanisms of emission are supposed to be dominant .",
    "these templates are the h @xmath35 map @xcite , for the free - free emission , the 408 mhz haslam map @xcite , for the synchrotron emission , and the fds 94 ghz dust map @xcite .",
    "these are then subtracted from the wmap data with coupling coefficients determined by cross correlating with the observed maps in the q ( 41 ghz ) , v ( 61 ghz ) , and w ( 94 ghz ) bands .",
    "nevertheless the templates are a poor approximation of the of the real sky near the galactic plane , so a kp2 mask must still be used in the analysis .",
    "the method is described in @xcite and @xcite ; @xmath36,\\nonumber\\\\ \\overline{t}_{v } & = & t_{v } - 1.100\\,[0.619\\ ,   t^{\\rm fds } + \\frac{1.923}{\\eta } \\,\\left(\\frac{\\nu_{v } } {   \\nu_{q}}\\right)^{-2.15}\\,t^{h\\alpha } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 1.006   \\,\\left(\\frac{\\nu_{v } } { \\nu_{q}}\\right)^{-2.7}\\,t^{\\rm sync}],\\\\   \\overline{t}_{w } & = & t_{w}- 1.251[0.873\\ , t^{\\rm fds } +   \\frac{1.923}{\\eta}\\ , \\left(\\frac{\\nu_{w } } {   \\nu_{q}}\\right)^{-2.15}\\,t^{h\\alpha } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + 1.006\\,\\left(\\frac{\\nu_{w } } { \\nu_{q}}\\right)^{-2.7}\\,t^{\\rm   sync}],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a correction factor due to reddening in the free - free template and @xmath38 ghz , @xmath39 ghz and @xmath40 ghz .",
    "the values in front of the left bracket convert the detector s temperature to thermodynamic temperature .",
    "it is considered that this is a sufficiently good method to remove the foregrounds outside the kp2 plane since it matches the correct amplitudes quite well , however the usual doubts remain , especially in the light of the alignment / low multipoles controversies .",
    "another point one can make is that whereas this may be a satisfactory technique to correct the foregrounds at the power spectrum level , its effect on higher order statistics is unknown and may actually induce unexpected correlations .",
    "we have generated a set of 3000 gaussian , cmb simulations of the wmap first year q , v , and w maps in healpix@xcite format with a resolution parameter @xmath41 .",
    "each simulation is smoothed with the q , v and w frequency channel beams and channel specific noise is added .",
    "we adopted the wmap best - fit @xmath42cdm with running index power spectrum to generate the @xmath3 coefficients of the maps .",
    "the kp2 galactic mask is imposed on each map .",
    "the masked maps are then decomposed into spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath3 using the anafast routine .",
    "we then calculate the four spectra ; namely the the power spectrum @xmath43 , single-@xmath1 bispectrum @xmath44 , @xmath0 inter-@xmath1 bispectrum @xmath45 and @xmath34 inter-@xmath1 bispectrum @xmath46 as described in section  [ sec : def ] .",
    "we then add channel - specific foregrounds outside the kp2 zone to the same set of gaussian simulations with amplitudes set as in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) .",
    "the addition of the foreground is scaled linearly by a factor @xmath35 as @xmath47 which we use to check the sensitivity of the bispectra to the foregrounds ( typically @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) .",
    "the power spectrum and bispectra are then calculated for the set of contaminated maps .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bisp ] we show the mean angular spectra of the simulations obtained by averaging over the ensembles .",
    "we show the mean spectra for the gaussian ( solid , black ) and the contaminated simulations for @xmath50 ( short - dashed , red ) and @xmath51 ( long - dashed , blue ) . the shaded area shows the variance of the three bispectra obtained directly from the gaussian simulations .",
    "we see that even for the fully contaminated set of maps ( @xmath51 ) the average signal is not significantly larger than the expected gaussian variance indicating that a detection would require averaging over a large number of modes",
    ". however we see some important distinguishing features in the signal in that it is sensitive to the parity of the multipole , being suppressed for odd @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the approximate symmetry of the foreground emission about the galactic plane which means that most of the signal will be in even @xmath1 modes since these have the same symmetry .",
    "this effect can be seen in all the spectra but most significant is the suppression of the odd inter-@xmath1 bispectrum @xmath52 with respect to the even inter-@xmath1 bispectra @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "another obvious feature of the even parity nature of the signal is the correlation between the spectra .",
    "in particular the absolute values of the @xmath44 and the @xmath46 are correlated with the structure visible in the fully contaminated power spectrum .",
    "overall the @xmath46 is the most sensitive statistic with the largest amplitude with respect to the gaussian variance although still quite small even at @xmath55 contamination .",
    "we now describe a number of statistical estimators we use to test the detectability of the template matched foregrounds in the q , v , and w channel maps .",
    "having seen how foregrounds affect the angular statistics of cmb maps , we can now devise specific tests to probe these properties on the bispectrum and test their sensitivity . the standard way to use the bispectrum as",
    "a test of general non - gaussianity is to use a reduced @xmath56 statistic @xcite .",
    "this is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a given bispectrum statistic , @xmath59 is its mean value computed over the monte carlo ensembles , and @xmath60 is the variance for each angular scale . the @xmath61 test is a measure of the deviation of the observed data from the expected mean , weighted by the gaussian variance of the estimator .",
    "foregrounds increase the amplitude of the bispectra foregrounds , but as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bisp ] , we can see that only @xmath46 seems to stand of chance of significant detections since the average amplitude of the signal is comparable to the variance , unlike the other components of the bispectrum .",
    "the detectability of the template matched signals using any of the bispectra can be tested by comparing the distribution of the @xmath62 values obtained from the contaminated simulations with that obtained from gaussian simulations .",
    "we compute the @xmath61 values for the contaminated maps using the mean and the variance obtained from the gaussian simulations , ie , the expected gaussian functions .",
    "we compare the distribution of the @xmath61 values for the gaussian simulations against the distribution obtained for the simulations with contamination ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we concentrate on the q band since it is the most contaminated frequency .",
    "the histograms of the @xmath63 are shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] . for the @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "spectra the histograms overlap completely .",
    "this means that the probability of finding contaminated simulations with a high @xmath63 is the same as for the gaussian simulations indicating that the @xmath56 test is insensitive to the presence of foreground contaminations at this level .",
    "however the @xmath46 spectrum tells a different story . there is a significant shift between the two distributions which implies that this component of the bispectrum has more sensitivity to foregrounds .",
    "the sensitivity can be quantified in terms of the fraction of the contaminated simulations ( with @xmath64 ) with a @xmath63 larger value than 95.45 @xmath65 ( i.e. 2 @xmath66 ) of the gaussian simulations ( with @xmath67 ) .",
    "the sensitivity for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 is low ( < 0.05 ) , whereas for @xmath46 the fraction increases to 0.355 .",
    "a template matched statistic can be defined by correlating the observed bispectra in the data with those of the foreground templates .",
    "this is more sensitive to the structure in the template signal as opposed to the @xmath63 test introduced above .",
    "we define a cross correlation statistic @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the bispectra obtained from the data and the @xmath71 are those obtained from the foreground templates .    in the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] we display the histograms for the @xmath72 values for the gaussian simulations against the distribution obtained for the contaminated ( @xmath73 ) simulations of the q band maps .",
    "the sensitivity has improved over the @xmath61 test , with the histograms of the input and output data sets being clearly shifted , meaning that there is a higher probability of detection of foregrounds using this method . again",
    "the effect is stronger in the @xmath46 .",
    "this result simply quantifies the statement that a matched template search for a contamination signal is more sensitive than a ` blind ' statistic such as the @xmath63 test .",
    "the values for the sensitivity of the test are given in table  [ tab : corr ] for all three wmap bands .",
    "for a gaussian field , the normalized bispectrum is statistically uncorrelated with the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , foreground residuals in the map induce non - gaussian correlations which in turn will induce correlations between the normalized bispectra and the power spectrum of the maps .",
    "this can provide another specific signature that one can use to detect the presence of foreground contamination .    for gaussian simulations ,",
    "the average power spectrum is just the input @xmath42cdm power spectrum and the bispectrum is effectively zero .",
    "on the other hand , the average angular spectra of the contaminated simulations have an emerging pattern of intermittency in both first- and second - order statistics .",
    "correlations between the power spectrum and the bispectra therefore come about due to the even parity induced by the characteristic galactic foregrounds .",
    "this means that the even modes of the power spectrum will be correlated with the even modes of the bispectra , whereas odd modes will remain uncorrelated . in order to test this effect on the maps ,",
    "we introduce the @xmath74 correlation statistic defined as @xmath75 + 1 } \\hat c_\\ell x_\\ell\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the observed power spectrum .",
    "we have chosen @xmath77 and @xmath78 as we are interested in the large angular scales where the effects of foreground contamination will dominate .",
    "we use the absolute value of the bispectrum in order to avoid the discrimination between negative and positive correlations which would affect our sum .",
    "we are only interested in the discrimination between the existence of absolute correlations against null correlations between the @xmath79 and the bispectra @xmath80 .",
    "again we test the sensitivity of this method by computing a distribution of @xmath74 for gaussian ensembles against the contaminated ensembles .",
    "we make sure that for gaussian ensembles we use the correlation of @xmath81 with @xmath82 and for the contaminated ensemble the correlation of @xmath83 with @xmath84 where @xmath85 stands for the gaussian cmb signal and @xmath86 indicates contaminated ensembles .",
    "this allows us to cancel the effect of the increase of power due to foregrounds in the correlation of the two statistics between the two tests .",
    "the results for the contaminated ensemble , @xmath73 , are plotted in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] and are summarized in table  [ tab : corr ] for all three bands .    .",
    "sensitivity of the @xmath68 and @xmath74 tests in terms of the fraction of the contaminated simulations ( @xmath51 ) with a larger value than 95.45 @xmath65 , ie 2 @xmath66 , of the gaussian simulations ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we present values for the q , v and w frequency channels and for the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath88 , where @xmath80 is a given bispectrum component stands for the correlation between @xmath89 with@xmath90 , whereas @xmath91 , represent the correlation of that specific bispectrum component with the respective power spectrum of the map .",
    "the values in the table quantify what can be seen in the histograms in figure  [ fig : histo ] .",
    "applying the tests for the @xmath46 component provides better sensitivity to the foregrounds . between the two tests @xmath68 seems to provide a marginally better sensitivity",
    "also , the q channel , being the most foreground contaminated yields the higher chances of detection . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : data ]",
    "we have applied the statistical tools described above to the wmap first year data @xcite .",
    "we considered both the raw and cleaned maps of the q , v , and w channels using the kp2 exclusion mask .",
    "we summarise the results in table  [ tab : data ] showing the separate confidence limits from each channel for both the raw and cleaned maps .    for the raw maps",
    "we find that only the q channel @xmath92 result is above the 95% threshold while for the q channel @xmath68 statistic , all confidence levels are above the 90% level with the @xmath93 above the 95% level .",
    "this is consistent with there being a component most correlated to the foreground templates at the lowest frequencies and with significant correlations between the @xmath94 inter-@xmath1 bispectrum and the power spectrum .",
    "since the raw maps do not have any foreground subtracted from them this is not a surprise although the confidence level suggests that the correlations are larger than what was found for the expected amplitude ( @xmath73 ) of the foregrounds .    for all @xmath44 and @xmath46 statistics the cleaned map results show confidence levels below the 95% level and indeed show an overall reduction in the significance of the correlations , indicating that the cleaning has removed a component correlated to the foreground templates , as one would expect .",
    "however for the @xmath45 statistics , which should in principle be the least sensitive to the foregrounds considered , we see that the confidence levels have all increased . indeed all three channels now have correlations significant above the 95% level in the @xmath68 statistic with the w channel also having a  @xmath95 confidence level .",
    "the cleaning algorithm appears to have introduced significant correlations with the foreground templates in the @xmath0 inter-@xmath1 bispectra and significant correlations between the @xmath0 inter-@xmath1 bispectrum and power spectrum of the w channel which is indicative of a non - gaussian component .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bisp_data ] we show the bispectra for each cleaned channel map and compare to the bispectra of the foreground template ( @xmath73 ) for each channel .",
    "this shows the nature of the result above .",
    "for both the @xmath44 and @xmath46 the cleaned map bispectra are anti - correlated with the foreground templates .",
    "in addition the the @xmath46 for all channels are heavily suppressed in the cleaned maps for multipoles @xmath96 compared to the expected gaussian variance shown in figure  [ fig : bisp ] .",
    "the @xmath45 gives the only bispectra that are correlated with the those of the templates .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ] shows the break down of the @xmath97 result into individual multipole contributions for each of the three bands . in particular it is interesting to note how the w band @xmath98 result shown in table  [ tab : data ] is dominated by an outlier at @xmath99 .",
    "at first sight our results appear contradictory . we have studied the effect of foreground contamination on the maps and concluded that foregrounds mainly affect the @xmath44 and @xmath46 components of the bispectrum due to its parity . by comparing the results for the raw and the foreground - cleaned maps , we are able to verify that the amplitude of @xmath44 and @xmath46 reduces as expected after foreground subtraction .    on the other hand , as shown in table  [ tab : data ] , the correlations induced in the @xmath45 appear to be close to inconsistent to a gaussian hypothesis with the correlation with the foreground templates at a significance above the @xmath100 level for the q - band , cleaned map .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the cleaned maps do worse in all bands for the @xmath68 measure .",
    "this is not what we naively expected since the foregrounds considered here have the wrong parity and their @xmath45 signal is heavily suppressed .",
    "however the cleaning procedure used by the wmap team _ does _ appear to increase the correlations @xmath68 of @xmath45 bispectrum to the input maps and its correlation @xmath101 with the power spectrum . recall that we expect the normalized bispectra to be independent of the power spectrum only in the gaussian case .",
    "the possibility of the foregrounds being more complex than accounted for in this type of treatment is to be considered carefully as this work has shown .",
    "the results shown here would suggest that the procedure used to go from the _ raw _ to _ cleaned _ wmap maps is under or over subtracting a component with @xmath102 parity in the bispectrum .",
    "this is probably not an indication that the procedure is faulty but rather that the templates used are not accurate enough to subtract the foregrounds .",
    "one source of inaccuracy is the simple scaling of the templates with respect to frequency .",
    "the _ cleaned _ maps are obtained assuming uniform spectral index and @xcite acknowledge that this is a bad approximation particularly for the 408 mhz haslam ( synchrotron ) template .",
    "this is seen when producing the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map which accounts for variation of the spectral index of the various component .",
    "unfortunately ilc maps can not be used in quantitative studies as their noise attributes are complicated by the fitting procedure and one can not simulate them accurately .",
    "future wmap ilc maps or equivalent ones obtained by ` blind ' foreground subtraction @xcite may be better suited for this kind of analysis once their statistical properties are well determined .",
    "it is expected that the impending second release of wmap data will allow more accurate foreground analysis and the statistical tools outlined in this work will be useful in determining the success of foreground subtraction .    it may be worthwile to include information of the higher order statistics when carrying out the foreground subtraction itself , for example by extending the ilc method to minimise higher order map quantities such as the skewness and kurtosis of the maps .",
