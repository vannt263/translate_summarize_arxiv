    "the interest in low - mass white dwarfs has increased recently because they appear frequently as a binary component , especially in several millisecond pulsar systems .",
    "detailed evolutionary calculations of possible binary scenarios existed only for isolated cases or limited mass ranges with @xmath1  m@xmath0 ( kippenhahn et al .  1967 , 1968 , refsdal & weigert 1969 , giannone et al .",
    "1970 , iben & tutokov 1986 , castellani et al .  1994 ) .",
    "only recently also calculations for @xmath2  m@xmath0 have been presented ( alberts et al .",
    "1996 , sarna et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the need for more extended sets of white dwarf models with helium cores prompted several authors to generate them from ad hoc assumed , simplified starting configurations which appear not to be consistent with evolutionary considerations ( althaus & benvenuto 1997 , benvenuto & althaus 1998 , hansen & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "these calculations are based on the implicit assumption that the contraction time to a _",
    "real _ white dwarf structure is short compared to the cooling time itself .",
    "since also the size of any unprocessed hydrogen - rich envelope can only be guessed , no definitive statement on the importance of residual hydrogen burning can be made .",
    "thus , we felt it necessary to provide a grid of evolutionary models for low - mass white dwarfs with structures being as consistent as possible with their expected evolutionary history , which can be used with confidence for interpreting observational data . in our study",
    "we aimed at addressing the following questions in a systematic way :    * how large are the masses of the outer , still unburned hydrogen - rich envelopes on top of the helium cores ?",
    "since the size of a white dwarf depends critically on the mass content of its unprocessed envelope , this question is closely related to the mass - radius relation of white dwarfs .",
    "* can the cooling properties of low - mass white dwarfs be reconciled with estimated spin - down ages of millisecond pulsars ? * are simplified model calculations useful in interpreting observational data ?",
    "we used an evolutionary code with the following basic input physics ( blcker 1995 ) : nuclear burning was accounted for by a nucleosynthesis network including 31 isotopes and 74 reactions up to carbon burning .",
    "radiative opacities were taken from iglesias et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , complemented with those of iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) and alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for the low temperature range , all for @xmath3 .",
    "convection was treated according to the mixing length theory .",
    "the mixing length parameter was chosen to @xmath4 , calibrated by computing a solar model .",
    "coulomb corrections of the equation of state have been taken from slattery et al .",
    "( 1982 ) .",
    "the outcome of the mass transfer in a close binary system was simulated in the following simple way : the evolution of a 1 m@xmath0 model was calculated up to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and depending on the desired final mass , high mass loss was switched on at the appropriate positions .",
    "when the model started to leave the rgb , mass loss was virtually switched off ( cf .",
    "iben & tutukov 1986 , castellani et al .",
    "more details of our calculations are given in driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "our method ensures that these red - giant remnants (= pre - white dwarf models ) have a structure which is consistent with their previous evolutionary history , with an electron degenerate helium core and a ( mainly ) unprocessed envelope .",
    "the following evolution of the models across the hertzsprung - russell diagram and down the cooling path depends only on their actual structure ( and mass - loss for larger luminosities ) , and not on the details of previous heavy mass - loss episodes during the supposed binary evolution , provided the mass donor regains its thermal equilibrium before it finally shrinks below its roche lobe .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the result of our calculations in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , encompassing remnant masses from well below 0.2 up to above 0.4  m@xmath0 .",
    "the two sequences between 0.2 and 0.3  m@xmath0 experienced typical thermal instabilities of thin burning shells when the cno cycle shuts off ( cf .",
    "kippenhahn et al .",
    "1968 , iben & tutukov 1986 , castellani et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the latter authors find cno flashes for masses above 0.3 m@xmath0 only for pop .",
    "ii compositions .",
    "we found a steep correlation between the remnant masses and the sizes of their hydrogen - rich envelopes , ranging from @xmath5 m@xmath0 for our 0.179 m@xmath0 model , down to @xmath6 m@xmath0 for 0.414 m@xmath0 .",
    "our envelope masses agree , for the mass range in common , @xmath7 m@xmath0 , with those given in castellani et al .",
    "for @xmath2 m@xmath0 they agree in mass _ and _ helium enrichment with those of the sarna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models .",
    "it should be emphasized that these evolutionary envelope masses are larger , for a given remnant mass , than those adopted recently by benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) and hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "hydrogen burning continues to increase the helium core at the expense of the envelope , and the pp cycle takes over on the cooling branch and completely determines the cooling rate for the lower - mass models ( webbink 1975 , castellani et al .",
    "the continued burning at the base of the envelope reduces its mass considerably along the cooling path , leading to a complicated dependence of the white dwarf s size on total mass and effective temperature . using our evolutionary mass - radius relationships instead of the ones available in the literature",
    ", larger white dwarf masses would follow for given surface gravities and effective temperatures ( see driebe et al .",
    "1998 for more details ) .",
    "at the hot end of the cooling branch the hydrogen luminosity can exceed the gravothermal contribution to the white dwarf s energy budget by up to a factor of 100 . even at effective temperatures as low as 5000  k the pp cycle still dominates in the models with @xmath2  m@xmath0 .",
    "since the evolution along the cooling sequence is slowed down accordingly , the isochrones for helium dwarfs differ in shape from those for co dwarfs : they are shifted and turned over to the left ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the position of the psr j1012 + 5307 white - dwarf companion is met by our 0.195 m@xmath0 track for a cooling age of 6 gyr , which agrees well with the spin - down age estimate of the pulsar , 7 gyr .",
    "it should be mentioned that this result is in close agreement with that of sarna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who made a rather detailed modeling of this particular system ( see also alberts et al .",
    "it is very instructive to compare the behaviour of our evolutionary models with that of non - evolutionary ones , as is done in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( see also blcker et al .",
    "1997 ) . despite the completely different initial structures of the two sets of non - evolutionary models shown in the figure , and somewhat different physical assumptions as well",
    ", the cooling properties are identical , and the models predict an age of only 0.4 gyr for the psr j1012 + 5307 companion , in variance with the pulsar s spin - down age .",
    "note also that the structure of our non - evolutionary model does not approach that of the evolutionary model before an effective temperature of about 5000 k is reached .",
    "* evolutionary white dwarf models are more compact than non - evolutionary models of the same mass and chemical structure .",
    "* envelope masses are inversely correlated with the white - dwarf mass .",
    "* at lower masses , hydrogen burning via the pp cycle controls the pace of cooling . * the thermo - mechanical structures of low - mass non - evolutionary models do not converge with those of evolutionary models within a reasonable time .",
