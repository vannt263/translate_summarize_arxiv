    "the question why macroscopic superpositions are not observable in everyday life has been raised most strikingly by schrdinger in his famous cat paradox .",
    "recent experiments @xcite , however , show that at least mesoscopic superpositions can be observed in quantum - optical systems . in quantum optics one",
    "usually speaks of a schrdinger cat ( sc ) state if one has a superposition of two different coherent states of a harmonic oscillator . in one of the experiments @xcite a superposition of two different coherent states",
    "have been created for an ion oscillating in a harmonic potential . in the other one @xcite two coherent states of a cavity mode",
    "were superposed , and also the process of the decoherence between these states could be followed by monitoring the field with resonant atoms .",
    "the unusual properties of such states have been discussed theoretically in several publications , see e.g. @xcite .    a different type of schrdinger cat like state can be created in principle in a collection of two - level atoms , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the terminology we may use , is the following : the individual two - level atoms can be regarded as the `` cells '' of the cat , and the cat is definitely alive , if all of its cells are alive , i.e. they are in the @xmath0 state , and it is definitely dead , if all the cells are in the ill , @xmath1 state . in the case of @xmath2 atoms",
    "a prototype of a sc like state is then : @xmath3 where each of the terms contain @xmath2 pluses and @xmath2 minuses .",
    "we shall call this state the polar cat state , because the two components are in the farthest possible distance from each other .",
    "this state is in the totally symmetric @xmath4 dimensional subspace of the whole @xmath5 dimensional hilbert space , and if such states are manipulated by a resonant electromagnetic field mode with dipole interaction , then the atomic system will remain in this subspace .",
    "this is the arena of the collective interaction of the atoms and the electromagnetic field , called superradiance @xcite . in this work we present results concerning the properties and dynamics of polar cat states",
    "( [ sc0 ] ) , and also of more general collective atomic states , the generation of which have also been considered recently @xcite .",
    "our approach of discussing the properties of quantum states like @xmath6 is based mainly on the method of the wigner function , which is one of the possible quasi - probability distributions .",
    "it has become a customary tool for investigating quantum states of an electromagnetic mode oscillator , or an ion oscillating in an appropriate trapping field @xcite .",
    "the method of wigner function is much less exploited , however , in the description of atomic states like ( [ sc0 ] ) .",
    "that is why we first summarize the essentials of this method , and then turn to the determination of the wigner function for the cat state ( [ sc0 ] ) in section ii .",
    "next , in section iii .",
    "we consider more general cat like states , which we call `` nonpolar cats '' and deteremine their squeezing properties . finally , in section iv .",
    "we write down and solve the master equation for a cat state in an environment with finite temperature .",
    "we define and determine the dissipation and decoherence times of the system , and the characteristic time when the system becomes essentially classical .",
    "the @xmath2-atom dipole interaction with the electromagnetic field is equivalent to the dynamics of a spin of @xmath7 , and the phase space of the atomic subsystem is the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 ) , which is sometimes called the bloch sphere .",
    "this phase space and quasiprobability distributions corresponding to various operators acting in the @xmath10 dimensional hilbert space have been introduced first by stratonovich @xcite .",
    "similar constructions have been considered independently by several authors @xcite .",
    "we use here the construction and notation introduced by agarwal @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of oscillator quasidistributions @xcite , the quasiprobability functions for angular momentum states are not unique either . beyond the natural requirements that the possible quasiprobability distribution functions have to satisfy",
    ", there is a special property , called the product rule , that distinguishes the most natural choice among the possible quasiprobability distributions .",
    "this rule requires that the expectation value of a product of two operators could be calculated by integrating the product of the corresponding quasiprobabilities .",
    "this choice is essentially unique , and in accordance with most authors we call it the wigner function for spin @xmath11 .",
    "we note that the construction can be extended to include several values of @xmath11 @xcite , and in the same spirit wigner functions can be defined for arbitrary lie groups @xcite .",
    "we also note that it is possible to define joint wigner functions for atom - field interactions , and then a fully phase space description of atom - field dynamics can be considered @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the problem of angular momentum with a fixed value of @xmath11 .    using the procedure proposed in @xcite we shortly summarize here the method of quasiprobability functions in the @xmath10 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one first chooses an operator basis in this space , and the most straightforward set of operators is the set of the spherical tensor operators @xmath12 which transform among others irreducibly under the action of the rotation operators@xcite .",
    "their explicit expression is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wigner @xmath15 symbol .",
    "they form a basis in the sense that any operator of the hilbert space can be expanded in terms of them and they fulfil the hilbert - schmidt orthonormality condition @xmath16 .    introducing the characteristic matrix of the density operator @xmath17 with respect of this operator basis as : @xmath18 the wigner function of the state @xmath19 is defined as : @xmath20",

    "@xcite considers that the static environment continously influences the dynamics of the atomic subsystem , which besides exchanging energy with the environment loses the coherence of its quantum superpositions and evolves into a classical statistical mixture .    in this section",

    ". therefore the spherical wigner function of a polar cat state , while subject to dissipation and decoherence , has its minimum value always at @xmath167 .",
    "thus in order to calculate @xmath144 , it is sufficient to follow the time evolution of the section @xmath168 . further , in connection with the calculation of the measure of non - classicality @xmath142 , it is sufficient to consider the above mentioned @xmath162-range when evaluating the integrals @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we have considered a class of states in an ensemble of two - level atoms , a superposition of two distinct atomic coherent states which are called atomic schrdinger cat states . according to the relative positions of the constituents we have defined polar and nonpolar cat states .",
    "we have investigated their properties based on the spherical wigner function , which has been proven to be a convenient tool to investigate the quantum interference effects .",
    "we have shown that nonpolar cat states generally exhibit squeezing , for which we have introduced the measure @xmath169 .",
    "the squeezing depends on the separation of the components of the cat and on the number of the atoms the cat is consisting of . by solving the master equation of this system embedded in an external environment",
    "we have determined the characteristic times of decoherence , dissipation and non - classicality of an initial polar cat state .",
    "we have shown how these depend on the number of the microscopic elements the cat consists of , and on the temperature of the environment .",
    "our results show that the decoherence of the polar cat state is surprisingly slow : @xmath146 is less then a half of an order of magnitude for zero temperature , making these states potentially significant in several areas of quantum physics , e.g. experimental studies of decoherence , quantum computing and cryptography .",
    "we have visualised the process , governed by the interaction with the external environment , using the spherical wigner function .",
    "its transformation in time reflects the characteristics of the behaviour of the atomic subsystem in a suggestive way .",
