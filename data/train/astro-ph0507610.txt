    "studies of galaxies in the local universe have demonstrated an apparent relation between the stellar mass of a spheroid and that of the super - massive black hole ( smbh ) which lies at its heart .",
    "the relation for spheroids , with the mass of the smbh typically @xmath3% of the spheroid mass , suggests that the growth of the black hole and the surrounding galaxy are related .",
    "this provides an important clue to understanding galaxy formation , as smbhs have been suggested as a highly efficient mechanism for regulating star formation in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "feedback _ is an essential part of current galaxy formation models and provides a physically - motivated explanation for the form of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "however , observational evidence for feedback , in particular driven by activity from smbhs , is sparse , especially for the youngest and most massive galaxies  for which it is expected to be most important @xcite .",
    "modeling agn - driven feedback is more difficult than the traditional star - formation feedback recipes . in part",
    "this is because we still lack a clear model for the early growth of the smbh , where bh  bh mergers and super - eddington accretion may both play a part .",
    "there is thus an urgent need for observations of the earliest phases of the evolution of spheroids and smbhs to guide development of theoretical models .",
    "studies of the submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that luminous far - infrared galaxies are likely to be associated with an early - phase in the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the intensity of their starbursts , the resulting high metallicity , along with their large dynamical masses , high gas fractions and strong clustering @xcite are all suggestive of a close link to the formation phase of the most massive spheroids @xcite . if these are indeed young spheroids , what can we learn about their black holes ?",
    "deep x - ray observations provide a sensitive probe of agn activity in submillimeter galaxies ( smg ) and can be used to place smbh mass constraints , even in the presence of heavy gas and dust obscuration . exploiting the unique sensitivity of the 2-ms exposure of the _ chandra _  deep field north (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite study a small sample of _ spectroscopically identified _ smgs and find that most host weak agn with modest absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities .",
    "this suggest two things : 1 ) the agns do not typically dominate the bolometric emission from smgs , and 2 ) the masses of the smbhs are likely to be @xmath4m@xmath2 ( eddington - limited smbh masses are typically @xmath5m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the large agn fraction in the smg population ( @xmath640% for sources with @xmath7mjy ) further indicates that the smbhs are growing almost continuously throughout these vigorous , but obscured , star - formation episodes .",
    "the stark contrast between the agn fractions in the smg and coeval uv - bright galaxy populations ( @xmath83% ; @xcite ) suggest that this joint black hole  stellar growth activity is most strongly connected with the smg population @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare estimates for the stellar and smbh masses for a sample of 13 high - redshift proto - spheroids ( identified with far - infrared luminous galaxies detected in the submillimeter and radio wavebands ) in the region .",
    "these all have precise spectroscopically identified redshifts and have hard x - ray emission dominated by an agn .",
    "the stellar mass estimates are derived from optical , near - infrared and most importantly the mid - infrared observations of this region by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ taken as part of the goods survey @xcite , while the smbh mass estimates are taken from @xcite based on the 2-ms _ chandra_observations .",
    "together , these data allow us to investigate the origin of the relation for young spheroids in the early universe . throughout",
    ", we adopt a cosmology with h@xmath9kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , masses and luminosities are given in solar units .",
    "for local galaxies , spatially resolved kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or reverberation mapping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are useful techniques for weighing the smbhs at the center of galaxies and relating these to the stellar masses of their spheroids .",
    "however , neither of these techniques can currently be applied to smgs at high redshifts and so by necessity we have to adopt much cruder methods to estimate both the black hole and spheroid masses . in this study",
    "we use the emission arising from accretion onto the smbh as a tracer of the black hole mass and the rest - frame near - infrared luminosity of galaxy as an indicator of its stellar mass .",
    "unfortunately , the rest - frame uv and optical spectra of the smgs provides an ambiguous tracer of the nuclear activity in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of merely identifying an agn from these observations , let alone reliably estimating their luminosities is likely caused by heavy obscuration towards the smbh or faint broad lines from intrinsically weak agn being lost against the continuum of the galaxy . conversely the weakness of the agn and their obscuration makes the use of the rest - frame near - infrared luminosity a much more reliable measure of the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "in contrast , hard x - ray emission from the accretion disk emerges relatively unattenuated from all but the most obscured regions , hence the x - ray emission from smgs may provide the most reliable probe of their smbh masses .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , only the _ chandra _ 2-ms observation of the region @xcite reaches the necessary depth to provide constraints on the x - ray luminosities of typical smgs . for this reason our analysis focuses on the sample of smgs with reliable spectroscopic redshifts from @xcite which lie within this field .",
    "we stress that precise redshifts are essential for our analysis .",
    "not only are the mass estimates dependent on a well - constrained luminosity distance , but more critically there are strong degeneracies in redshift and age in the fitting of their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) described in  3 .",
    "using the sample of spectroscopically identified , radio - detected smgs in the cdf - n from @xcite , obscuration - corrected x - ray luminosities were derived for 15 galaxies and smbh masses estimated assuming eddington accretion by @xcite .",
    "we discard two of these galaxies from our analysis : j123716.01 + 620323.3 falls outside the mid - infrared coverage , and the optical / mid - infrared photometry of j123632.61 + 620800.1 is contaminated by a diffraction spike from a bright ( @xmath13 ) object only 11@xmath14  away .",
    "these conditions prevent us from estimating the stellar masses needed in  3.2 , hence we concentrate on 13 smgs with optical , near - infrared and mid - infrared photometry or limits and reliable spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "these galaxies range in redshift from @xmath152.9 , with a median comparable to that of the entire smg population ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectral analysis in @xcite shows that the bulk of the hard x - ray emission from the smgs in our sample is likely to be due to accretion onto the smbh , with star formation contributing only at the softest energies , @xmath16kev in the rest - frame .",
    "the luminosity from the x - ray waveband is only a few percent of the bolometric luminosity from the smbh , and @xcite adopted a bolometric correction ( bc@xmath17 ) of @xmath18% consistent with other studies .",
    "they also employed eddington arguments to show that @xmath19 , where the bolometric luminosity is in units of ergs@xmath10 .",
    "the factor @xmath20 is unity for eddington - limited accretion , and @xmath21 for sub - eddington . as our bench - mark",
    "we adopt eddington - limited accretion and use this to investigate the relation between black hole and stellar masses for our sample .",
    "in addition to the x - ray constraints on the luminosities and hence masses of the smbhs , our analysis also requires estimates of the stellar masses of the host galaxies .",
    "a particularly simple and relatively robust way of deriving the mass of a stellar population is to use the rest - frame near - infrared luminosity and a theoretical mass to light ratio . for all but the youngest stellar populations ,",
    "the rest - frame near - infrared emission is dominated by light from main sequence stars and hence , for example , the rest - frame @xmath22-band luminosity changes by only a factor of two between stellar populations with ages of 100myr and 1gyr @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath23-band luminosities of the same populations on the other hand vary by a factor of ten .",
    "in addition to its relative insensitivity to age variations , the rest - frame @xmath22-band is over ten times less sensitive to reddening than @xmath23-band , which is important to consider for these dusty smgs .    at the redshift of our targets ,",
    "the rest frame @xmath22-band is shifted towards the mid - infrared and hence _ spitzer _ observations are required to estimate the stellar mass .",
    "for this reason , we obtained the irac images of goods - n from the _ spitzer _  archive ( v.1 20041027 and v.1 20050505 enhanced data products ) .",
    "we used sextractor to measure the photometry and uncertainties in these for each of the galaxies on the irac imaging . by constructing curves of growth for several isolated objects",
    ", we determined that 6@xmath14  diameter apertures were necessary to measure the total irac flux from our targets . since source confusion is an issue for these extremely deep exposures",
    ", we used 4@xmath14  diameter apertures and then applied a small aperture correction , determined to be 0.22 , 0.26 , 0.33 , and 0.30 mag for the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath24 m  bands respectively .",
    "even so , we were unable to adequately constrain the 3.6@xmath24 m  flux for three sources due to confusion noise from nearby sources .",
    "we provide the irac photometry for all 13 sources in table  [ tab : phot - spitzer ] . at 5.8@xmath25 m , which corresponds to a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath26 m ,",
    "the ten high - redshift smgs at @xmath27 have a bright mean magnitude of @xmath28 , with the entire sample spanning under an order of magnitude in flux .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath29-band fluxes , which cover well over an order of magnitude .",
    "the modest dispersion in the mid - infrared fluxes of the smgs already suggests that we are dealing with a relatively homogeneous population of luminous , high redshift galaxies .",

    "however , focusing on the ten higher - redshift smgs , at @xmath27 , of those with full coverage of their rest - frame uv and optical seds , 80% show a detectable discontinuity in their seds around 4000  in the rest - frame ( fig .  [",

    "we interpret this break as arising from the balmer limit in stellar populations with ages of @xmath181 s myrs .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the likely nature of smgs as luminous far - infrared sources seen during a phase of intense star formation .",
    "we note that age - related differential reddening may also account for the relative strength of this feature in an even younger on - going starburst @xcite .",
    "due to the complex mix of extinction expected within smgs @xcite , which may influence different age stellar populations to different degrees , we have adopted a very simple approach in determining our stellar masses .",

    "this approach has the added advantage that the properties of the best - fit spectral templates may provide some insights into the properties of the stellar populations within these galaxies .",

    "j123549.44 + 621536.8 also has a moderate near - ir excess , but the significance is muted somewhat by its proximity to the edge of the irac map , where photometry was more difficult to estimate .",

    "this difference most likely reflects the increased sensitivity to reddening corrections in the rest - frame @xmath23-band , in addition to the fact that near - infrared luminosities better probe the evolved stellar population .",

    "such a correlation would also be expected if the @xmath22-band light were due to hot dust powered by the agn . however , with only a few exceptions , the seds seem to be dominated by stellar light , as evident from a well - defined stellar bump peaking near 1.6@xmath24 m ( fig .  [",

    "with the assumptions about the l@xmath183/m and eddington fraction @xmath20 we have adopted , our results suggest that the black holes in smgs require significant growth in order to approach the present - day relation . to understand the significance of this conclusion ,",

    "this demonstrates how difficult it is for any one factor to explain the difference between our sample and the local relation , and suggests that either the discrepancy is real , or that biases in the parameters must conspire if , in fact , smgs have a black - hole / stellar mass ratio comparable to local systems .",
    "we now discuss these potential biases in more detail .",
    "we begin by pointing out that the stellar masses we derived are on average five times higher than those reported from modeling the uv / optical seds of smgs in @xcite .",

    "we attribute the difference in our masses to those from @xcite to the absence of mid - infrared information to constrain the sed modeling in the earlier work , which is then much more sensitive to the reddening corrections derived from the sed fits to these very dusty galaxies and the possibilities of strong differential reddening within their young stellar populations .    in our modeling of the stellar mass of the systems we adopted a l@xmath183/m ratio of 3.2 , characteristic of a burst with an age of @xmath260myrs .",
    "if we require that the smg and the present - day m@xmath237m@xmath238 relations agree , then from eq .",

    "this corresponds to l@xmath183/m@xmath261 , which is not possible with the miller - scalo imf . for a salpeter imf ,",
    "such a high l@xmath183/m ratio implies ages for the smgs of @xmath262myrs .",
    "we discuss the implications for varying the imf later in this section .",
    "however , we note that there are fundamental inconsistencies in our calculations if we rigidly interpret the star formation histories we used .",
    "the smgs in our sample have been selected on the basis of their intense far - infrared luminosities , which implies high star formation rates .",
    "the fast decline in the far - infrared emission from a starburst after star formation ceases indicates that star formation is currently on - going in these systems or has declined significantly in only the last few 10 s of myrs .",
    "the submm detection of these sources is therefore formally inconsistent with the star formation history in our burst model  where there has been no star formation within the galaxy in the past @xmath261myrs .",
    "although the alternative csf models include on - going star formation , the much higher ages derived from these fits are equally inconsistent with a constant rate of star formation at the level indicated by the observed far - infrared emission from the smgs , @xmath812@xmath263m@xmath2yr@xmath10 . to form an @xmath264 galaxy with a constant sfr at this level",
    "would take just @xmath8100myrs , not the 2gyrs derived from the fits .",
    "there are two solutions to solve these inconsistencies within our models : 1 ) allow a more complex star formation history , most likely involving a recent burst of activity ; 2 ) apply age - dependent dust extinction to the stellar populations , with the youngest stars being most extincted .",
    "as both solutions involve additional free - parameters to what is already a weakly - constrained problem , we will only qualitatively discuss their impact .",
    "bursts of star formation are a natural consequence of interaction - induced activity due to the cyclic behavior of bound orbits @xcite .",
    "they lead to a dispersion in the properties of smgs dependent on the number of previous bursts they have experienced .",
    "the main consequence in terms of our analysis is the realization that the present activity may not have produced the total stellar population we observe .",
    "mixing in a fraction of older stars will systematically decrease the effective l@xmath183/m , potentially increasing the masses of the galaxies .",
    "this would therefore push the smgs even further away from the @xmath265 m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .",
    "age - dependent or selective extinction of the stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within smgs can preferentially extinguish the uv emission from the youngest stars .",
    "this results in seds with much redder spectral indices between the uv and near - infrared than can be achieved with a simple foreground dust screen acting upon the whole stellar population .",
    "when the diffusion timescale for stars to escape their obscured birth - places is around a few 100 s myrs , this process can also help reproduce the strength of the spectral breaks at @xmath84000 , even in galaxies with significant on - going star formation . as a result ,",
    "selective extinction would provide the opportunity to fit the sed of our smg sample with relatively young csf models , @xmath8100myrs , consistent with the ages needed to produce their observed near - infrared luminosities given the star formation rates inferred from their far - infrared emission .",
    "attempts to estimate typical ages for smgs include the spectral dating of the few examples with high - quality uv spectroscopy .",
    "such an analysis by @xcite indicates an age for a uv - bright smg of @xmath266myrs , similar to the minimum age we require .",
    "however , as @xcite state the smg they model may be a rare system and the small proportion of smgs showing similar signs of young stellar populations in their spectra suggests a more typical age for an smg would be 50100myrs .",
    "another estimate of the likely age of smgs can be derived via gas - depletion timescales using the measured mass of the gas reservoir and the estimated star formation rates suggest likely lifetimes of @xmath267myrs @xcite , where we have assumed an agn contribution to the far - infrared luminosities in line with @xcite . finally , taking our estimated stellar masses and the median star formation rates derived from the far - infrared luminosities of the smgs in our sample using our adopted imf",
    ", we determine lifetimes of @xmath181myrs to produce the stellar populations we see . balancing these estimates with those from the sed fitting ,",
    "we conclude that the typical ages of smgs are likely to be @xmath268myrs .",
    "hence the stellar masses are inconsistent with what would be predicted from the local m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation assuming our black - hole masses are accurate .",
    "are there other ways to change the effective l@xmath183/m without invoking such young ages ? one way to reduce it is to have a significant contribution to the rest - frame @xmath22-band light from the agn .",
    "however the bulk of our sample , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : allseds ] , are well - fit by a stellar component only . in the few cases where agn cause the sed fits to diverge at the longer wavelengths ,",
    "the estimated luminosity we derive at 2.2@xmath25 m is still dominated by the stars .",
    "we used the 8@xmath24 m  excess ( the ratio of the measured 8@xmath24 m  flux over that derived from the best fit model template ) to quantify possible agn contamination .",
    "we find that the @xmath27 sources ( excluding the 3 marked as having an obvious near - ir excess ) have an average excess of 1.0 , suggesting little or no contribution from an agn .",
    "the remaining three sources however , have an average excess of @xmath269 , which means a nearly equal contribution to the rest - frame @xmath22-band from agn as stars . scaling down the stellar masses of these three galaxies to account for this results in only a @xmath184 reduction in the mean stellar mass of the sample , which is small considering the other factors we discuss .",
    "in addition to contribution of light from the agn , we note that our analysis includes light from _ all _ of the stars , and not simply the bulge component used in deriving the local relation . while the high - resolution _ hst_/nicmos imaging verifies that the rest - frame @xmath23-band light in smgs are reasonably fit by a @xmath82 surface brightness profile @xcite",
    ", some systems do show a significant disk component .",
    "whether these stars are still in a disk component at the present - day or whether they would have been driven into the bulge through , for example , bar - instabilities , is impossible to verify , and so we flag this to the reader as a fundamental uncertainty of our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we note that any correction to the stellar masses due to a disk component is unlikely to change the inferred spheroid mass by more than a factor of 2@xmath270 for a small fraction of the smgs .",
    "the imf also has a significant effect on stellar mass estimates .",
    "@xcite argue that an imf biased to more massive stars is required to reproduce the properties of smgs in current semi - analytic galaxy formation models , and invoke a power - law imf with an index flatter than the canonical salpeter @xcite slope of @xmath271 .",
    "we used starburst99 to study the effect of this top - heavy imf on our mass estimates , but find that the stellar mass estimates change by at most a factor of @xmath272 for the range of likely ages for smgs .",
    "an additional factor of three in the light - to - mass ratio can be picked up by truncating the imf at @xmath273m@xmath2 , and there are different imf prescriptions ( such as the one proposed by @xcite that has an increased @xmath22-band contribution from thermally pulsating agb stars ) that can also increase the effective light - to - mass ratio . altogether it is possible that these effects could conspire to decrease our stellar masses by up to a factor of @xmath274 .",
    "however , we conclude that any bias present in the stellar mass is insufficient by itself to account for the difference between our results and the local relation .",
    "are the high stellar masses we derive in conflict with other estimates of the masses of smgs ?",
    "dynamical masses for smgs from co spectroscopy with millimeter interferometers indicate a median gas+stellar masses of @xmath275 within the central @xmath262kpc of typical smgs with 850-@xmath25 m fluxes of a few mjys @xcite .",
    "in addition , five of the galaxies in our sample have dynamical mass estimates from h@xmath276 spectroscopy @xcite , which all give constraints on the masses of @xmath27711.3 , again on @xmath278kpc scales . in a recent analysis , @xcite use the integrated co line luminosities for 12 smgs to estimate an average contribution from gas of @xmath279 within @xmath262kpc for these systems . thus taking into account the contribution from gas ,",
    "the dynamical estimates are consistent with the presence of @xmath280 of stars within the central regions of the smgs .    as highlighted by @xcite the h@xmath276 dynamical mass estimates derived from the h@xmath276 line widths for smgs are five times higher than similar constraints on uv - selected galaxies at comparable redshifts @xcite .",
    "to see if this difference is also reflected in the stellar mass estimates for the two populations , we ran our hyper - z  analysis on the sample of 72 spectroscopically confirmed , uv - selected , and irac - detected , galaxies at @xmath281 presented in @xcite .",
    "these uv - selected galaxies @xcite make an ideal comparison set , as they are more modestly star - forming galaxies at roughly the median redshift of our sample . as with our analysis , the fits to the data from @xcite were degenerate in sed template , age and reddening .",
    "roughly one - third of the objects are best fit by a young ( @xmath282myr ) burst while the remainder are better modeled by a constant star - formation history with age of @xmath283myr .",
    "again we find that the choice of model has little impact on the derivation of the stellar mass , and we obtain a mean of @xmath284 for this sample .",
    "the estimated ages and masses are in good agreement to the results which @xcite derive using a more detailed analysis ( @xmath285 ) .",
    "this confirms that our approach to stellar mass estimation is robust and also suggests that the smgs in our sample are on average @xmath274 times more massive than the uv - selected population at @xmath286 .",
    "overall , we conclude that our stellar masses are consistent with dynamical limits on the masses of the smg population and support the suggestion that the central regions of these galaxies are baryon dominated .",
    "we note that the co detections of smgs indicate that there is sufficient gas present to continue to build the black hole , but at the same time the gas masses are small enough that they will not appreciably change the stellar masses even if the bulk of it is converted into stars . only by bringing in more gas or stars into these systems ( through cooling or mergers )",
    "can their stellar masses be significantly increased from what we measure .",
    "is it possible that the sources only appear to lie below the local relation because the black - hole mass estimates from @xcite are too low ? certainly , in the light of the discussion above it appears that the black hole mass estimates are probably the more important source of uncertainty in our analysis . in estimating the black - hole masses , @xcite assumed eddington - limited accretion and a @xmath18% bolometric correction to convert the observed absorption - corrected l@xmath17 to m@xmath246 . since the eddington limit appears to provide a reasonable upper bound to the accretion rate of black holes ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , this approach essentially provides a lower limit on the black - hole masses and sub - eddington accretion would imply larger black holes .",
    "however , an average black - hole mass @xmath258 times higher is needed to reconcile our data at the characteristic stellar mass of the smgs , @xmath1m@xmath2 .",
    "this would require @xmath287 , which is low given the gas - rich environments in which the smbhs are likely to reside .",
    "although we do not know the eddington rate of these galaxies , the large fraction of smgs that host agn activity suggests that the accretion is likely to be reasonably efficient ( see @xcite ) . there is tangential support for this claim from studies that have estimated black - hole masses for other active high - redshift populations independently of the eddington rate , finding @xmath2880.11.7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the smallest accretion efficiencies found in these studies , the black - hole masses would still be @xmath85 times too small for our estimated stellar masses .",
    "there is further support for eddington - limited or near eddington - limited accretion from the similarity between the optical / near - infrared spectra of some smgs with those of local narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies ; see  4.3 of @xcite . if the spectral similarities of the agn signatures in these two populations are suggestive of comparable physical conditions in the accretion disk around the smbh , then the approximately eddington - limited rates estimated for local nls1s may be appropriate for smgs .",
    "moreover , nls1s appear to have smaller black holes than those predicted from the local m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation ; using reverberation mapping , @xcite and @xcite show that that the smbhs in nls1s are an order of magnitude smaller than predicted for galaxies having a stellar mass of @xmath289m@xmath2 .",
    "thus physical models for the accretion disks and smbhs in nls1s may be very relevant for understanding the growth of smbhs in massive , young galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "we do caution the reader that the broad - line region in smgs may be missed due to heavy extinction in these dusty galaxies , and hence the spectra may be dominated by a less obscured narrow - line region .",
    "high signal - to - noise spectra would be useful to search for faint , broad wings that may be otherwise missed .",
    "there is also theoretical support for @xmath290 efficiencies : @xcite and @xcite predict that this condition will be met near the peak epoch of star formation , where these objects have a stronger chance of being detected at submm wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , these models also predict black hole masses @xmath291  12 orders of magnitude smaller than the local relation during the obscured , star - bursting phase , similar to what our data suggest .",
    "hence , while the assumption of eddington limited accretion is a large one , it is not a unreasonable choice .",
    "we reiterate that even an efficiency 10 times smaller would still result in the black - holes in smgs being smaller than would be predicted by the local relation .",
    "another uncertainty in the smbh estimates comes from the bolometric correction applied to the x - ray luminosities .",
    "@xcite assumed that @xmath18% of the energy output due to accretion was emitted in the x - ray waveband @xcite , but if this was lower , the inferred mass of the smbh would rise .",
    "however , they also pointed out that this correction is similar to the estimated bolometric corrections for obscured and unobscured agn of similar luminosity to the agns in the smgs ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a final potential source of uncertainty in the smbh masses comes from the possibility that a substantial fraction of the x - ray emission from the smbh is still obscured at rest - frame energies of @xmath820kev .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that the _ chandra _",
    "2-ms exposure of the cdf - n fails to recover approximately 40% of the hard x - ray background .",
    "this may in part be hidden within highly - obscured ` type-2 ' quasars @xcite , but dusty smgs also harbor obscured agn ( and could in some cases be type-2 quasars ) .",
    "indeed , not all smgs are detected in the _ chandra _",
    "2-ms x - ray image and so potentially some fraction of the x - ray emission from the smbh in this population could be missed from the _ chandra _  analysis . in  3.5 of @xcite ,",
    "it is pointed out that while obtaining tight constraints on the obscuring column densities for individual sources is difficult , the agreement between their models and x - ray spectra of smgs ranked by obscuration class is excellent , suggesting that most of the x - ray emission in these sources is accounted for .",
    "if a large fraction of the x - ray emission in smgs is still absorbed , we will need to wait for the next generation of x - ray observatories to find it .      to summarize the previous two subsections",
    ", it is possible to find combinations of the parameters used to estimate the stellar and black hole masses of smgs which would reconcile them with the local m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .",
    "for example , if we assume a 6% bolometric correction , then we require a combination of a typical smg age of just @xmath292myrs and an eddington efficiency of @xmath293 to place the high - redshift data on the local relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : range ] ) .",
    "this combination is plausible , and if it is the case then the implication is that the stellar and black hole mass grow simultaneously , with a mass ratio that is similar at high redshift as well as low .",
    "however , the need for both low eddington accretion and a very short lifetime for the smgs is uncomfortable and hence we should also explore the possibility that the black holes in smgs are , in fact less massive than expected from their stellar masses and the low redshift m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .",
    "the following discussion assumes that this is indeed the case .",
    "the theoretical models of @xcite suggest that smbhs may grow exponentially , taking only a few 10 s of myr to mature @xcite .",
    "this is a short enough time - scale that smgs with more evolved smbhs , which lie on the local relationship , should fall within the redshift range probed by our sample . that we do not see such systems",
    "implies that as the black hole rapidly builds up its mass , it either shuts down the star - formation that powers the far - infrared luminosities ( hence they drop out of the submillimeter samples ) or they become so obscured that they are no longer detected in the x - ray waveband .",
    "the former argument supports a scenario that links the qso and smg populations .",
    "as the black hole undergoes a rapid buildup of mass , the ensuing strong radiation field strips away the obscuring gas and dust , terminating star formation and eventually allowing the agn to be visible for a short time as a luminous optical quasar .",
    "the close similarity between the redshift distribution of radio - identified smgs and qsos @xcite also lends support to this hypothesis , as does the relative space densities of smgs and qsos given our estimates of their respective lifetimes @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent high resolution adaptive optics imaging by @xcite has shown that the black hole masses and host galaxy luminosities of @xmath294 quasars are consistent with the local m@xmath295m@xmath238 relation , suggesting that qsos could be the end - product of the rapid growth of smbhs seen soon after an smg - like phase .",
    "finally , work by @xcite using scuba to measure the rest - frame far - infrared luminosities of unobscured and moderately obscured qsos at @xmath296 verify that the former class represent a phase of significant smbh growth but not bulge growth , while the latter may be a transition phase between the star - formation dominated smgs and agn - dominated quasars .",
    "thus , if smgs are the progenitors of quasars , they _ must _ lie below the locally determined m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .    in conclusion",
    ", there is good qualitative and quantitative agreement for an evolutionary sequence which connects moderate mass smbhs in far - infrared luminous , star - forming galaxies at @xmath2963 ( when most of the spheroid is produced ) , with subsequent growth of the smbhs during a short phase as a luminous quasar to result in massive spheroids at the present - day which lie on the m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .",
    "using deep _ chandra _ , _ spitzer _ , and ground - based optical and near - infrared imaging data , we have estimated the stellar and black hole masses for a sample of 13 smgs with precise spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .   there is a tentative correlation between the rest - frame near - infrared and x - ray luminosity in this sample of smgs .",
    "the x - ray emission likely arises from accretion of matter onto a smbh , and so can be used to estimate its mass .",
    "we find a similar correlation between rest - frame x - ray and @xmath23-band luminosities , but this exhibits more scatter , suggesting that it is more sensitive to dust and age variations in these young , obscured galaxies . 2 .",
    "the restframe uv  optical  near - infrared seds of most of our smgs are dominated by stellar emission and not light from the agn , and are well - described by either a young burst model , or by an older galaxy with a more continuous star - formation history . in both cases , the derived light - to - mass ratios , and hence stellar mass estimates , are similar .",
    "the mean stellar mass for the sample is @xmath251 , consistent with h@xmath276 and co dynamical mass estimates for the smg population .",
    "hence the _ spitzer_observations have shown that these intense star - forming galaxies have a significant stellar population in place at @xmath286 .",
    "we find that smgs are typically 10 times more massive than typical uv - selected galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "we use the assumption of eddington - limited accretion to estimate the black hole masses for each galaxy in the sample .",
    "we find that for a given stellar mass , the black holes are @xmath258 times less massive than those for spheroids with similar stellar masses in the local universe .",
    "6 .   in order to determine if the high - redshift smgs lie of the local m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation , we explore the range of assumptions that are used to estimate both the stellar and black hole masses .",
    "we find that most reasonable combinations of parameters lead to lower black hole masses at a fixed stellar mass in smgs at @xmath294 compared to the low redshift relation for spheroids .",
    "we suggest the nls1 galaxies may be a good template for understanding the growth of smbhs at high redshift .",
    "they have spectral properties common with many smgs , and ( locally ) have black hole masses smaller than predicted for less active spheroids .",
    "our results are consistent with a model where the smbhs in smgs subsequently undergo rapid growth to reach the local m@xmath237m@xmath238 relation .",

    "<S> we analyze deep x - ray , optical and mid - infrared _ spitzer_observations of the cdf - n / goods </S>",
    "<S> - n region to study a sample of 13 submillimeter - detected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( median @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are among the most active and massive at this epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a power - law correlation between the estimated stellar and x - ray luminosity , implying that masses of the black holes may be related to the stellar masses of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the rest - frame uv  near - infrared spectral energy distributions for these galaxies , believed to be young spheroids , and fit them with model templates . using the rest - frame near - infrared luminosities , which are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in stellar ages and reddening in these young dusty galaxies , and theoretical mass - to - light ratios </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate their stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> although the submillimeter emission implies that these galaxies are undergoing an epoch of intense star - formation , the _ spitzer _  </S>",
    "<S> data reveal a massive stellar population already in place . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our submillimeter galaxies have a median stellar mass of @xmath1m@xmath2 , which is roughly ten times more massive than typical uv - selected star - forming systems at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> these stellar masses are then compared to previously published black hole mass estimates derived from the x - ray luminosities under the assumption of eddington - limit accretion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the black hole masses for our high - redshift sample are approximately 12 orders of magnitude smaller than galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> although our estimates of black hole masses will increase if the accretion is sub - eddington , and our stellar masses will decrease if we assume a much younger stellar population or a different initial mass function , we find that only through a combination of effects is it possible to shift the high redshift galaxies such that they lie on the local relation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the black holes need to grow substantially between @xmath0 and the present - day , with much of the black hole growth occurring _ after _ the current obscured , far - infrared luminous phase of activity which is likely associated with the formation of the spheroid . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation supports a scenario where submillimeter galaxies pass through a subsequent accretion - dominated phase , where they would appear as optically bright quasars . </S>"
