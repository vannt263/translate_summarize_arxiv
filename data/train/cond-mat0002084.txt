    "one observes long ballistic flights in which the diffusing particle moves at a constant velocity .",
    "the transport is characterized by a distribution of free flight times which follows a power law decay .",
    "these processes have been usually analyzed using the lvy walk framework ( see more details below ) @xcite .",

    "it has been also shown @xcite that pore chord distributions , in certain three - dimensional porous media decay as a power law , at least for several length scales .",

    "this has motivated the investigation of a fractal lorentz gas .",
    "levitz @xcite has simulated trajectories of a light particle reflected from a three - dimensional intersection of a four - dimensional weierstrass  mandelbrot hyper surface , and found an enhanced lvy type diffusion .",
