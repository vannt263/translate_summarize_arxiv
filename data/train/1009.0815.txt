    "this can not be the case for our samples as the [ @xmath240]@xmath4 in - plane orientation would result in reciprocal space maps with both the ( 620)@xmath4 and the ( 260)@xmath4 peak visible in the same plot . in e.g. figure",
    "[ xrd]f this is clearly not the case .",
    "together with the presence of the satellites in figure [ xrd]b and [ xrd]d only in the [ 001]@xmath4 direction , we conclude that sample d is twinned in domains with different [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 and [ 001]@xmath4 orientations .",
    "for the two thinner samples we observed the same behavior as the thicker samples with equal substrate treatment ( not shown ) .",
    "sample u12 was untwinned as concluded from the positions of the bragg reflections , but here no satellites could be observed .",
    "sample t29 was twinned with satellites in both directions in reciprocal space .    to explain the absence of twinning in the samples with smooth surfaces we compare our results to the more widely studied srruo@xmath2 ( sro ) thin films on sto substrates .",
    "sro is orthorhombic and single domain films can be realized by growth on smooth vicinal substrates with stepedges approximately aligned with the main crystal axis . in that case",
    "the [ 001]@xmath4 lattice directions aligns with the stepedge direction @xcite .",
    "this has been explained in three different ways .",
    "gan et al . suggested that single domain growth is related to the observed stepflow growth mode @xcite .",
    "maria et al . suggested that stepedge strain is the dominant mechanism as the films are not orthorhombic at deposition temperature @xcite .",
    "finally vailionis et al . suggested that the films are tetragonal at deposition temperature and that the [ 001]@xmath25 lattice direction aligns preferentially with the stepedges @xcite .",
    "in contrast to sro the lsmo films have a preferred orientation with the [ 001]@xmath4 lattice direction aligned perpendicular to the stepedges and does not grow in stepflow mode",
    ". therefore the explanation by maria et al .",
    "is the most likely candidate to explain the single domain growth . during cooldown",
    "orthorhombic domains nucleate at the stepedges and the stepedge strain favors octahedra buckling in one direction and the domains continue to grow across the terraces resulting in a single domain film . for the samples with a rough surface the orthorhombic domains can nucleate at defects at the substrate surface and no preferential orientation exists , resulting in twinned films .    in summary , growth on a relatively smooth surface results in untwinned lsmo films , while growth on terraces with reduced crystalline quality results in twinned lsmo films .",
    "we used the difference in magnetic properties between twinned and untwinned films to identify the contribution from the orthorhombicity as it should be reduced for the twinned samples .",

    "the ratio @xmath40 changes by a factor of 10 .    the anisotropy field @xmath41 can be obtained from the slope d@xmath42/d@xmath43 at @xmath43=0 in the hard axis magnetization loop of a material with uniaxial anisotropy by the relation @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath42 is the magnetization and @xmath43 is the applied field .",

    "we obtained a value for @xmath29 of 540@xmath195 j / m@xmath48 for the almost uniaxial sample u40 .",
    "this would imply a biaxial anisotropy constant of 600@xmath1910 j / m@xmath48 which corresponds well with earlier obtained results @xcite .",
    "therefore one can assume that the @xmath30 value is the same for all films and independent of thickness .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy constants are calculated from the @xmath40 ratios and presented in table  [ table ] as well .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy is very weak for these samples , only in the range 50 - 600 j / m@xmath48 .",
    "next we turn to the origin of both contributions to the anisotropy .",
    "the biaxial contribution with easy axes aligned with the @xmath12110@xmath13@xmath14 lattice directions corresponds well with earlier results of magnetic anisotropy of lsmo on sto ( 001)@xmath11 substrates @xcite .",
    "this represents the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy of lsmo strained to in - plane cubic symmetry . for the uniaxial contribution",
    "different explanations exist .",
    "it is well known that a weak uniaxial anisotropy in lsmo can be the result of stepedge induced anisotropy @xcite . however , the thickness dependence of the uniaxial anisotropy is at odds with an interpretation in terms of stepedge induced anisotropy .",
    "the stepedge induced anisotropy compared to the biaxial anisotropy should scale with the ratio of the volume of the surface layers containing the stepedges ( in practice the monolayers at the interfaces ) to the volume of the film .",
    "therefore the stepedge induced anisotropy should be most pronounced for the thinnest films as the miscut of the samples was comparable . here the opposite is observed .",
    "also the uniaxial easy axis was not aligned with the stepedge directions in most of the samples , sometimes even 90 degrees perpendicular to the stepedges .",
    "this rules out the contribution of stepedge induced anisotropy .",
    "the uniaxial easy axis is aligned with the [ 001]@xmath4 lattice direction while the hard axis is aligned with the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 lattice direction .",
    "this , together with the reduced uniaxial anisotropy for the twinned samples , relates the observed anisotropy to the orthorhombicity of the lsmo films .",
    "it is unclear what the origin of the magnetic anisotropy in the orthorhombic crystal structure is . in general magnetic anisotropy in manganites",
    "is explained by a global strain field which relates the easy axis to the maximum strain direction @xcite .",
    "this can not be applied for these samples , as the lsmo has equal strain in the [ 001]@xmath4 and the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 lattice directions due to the cubic symmetry of the substrate .",
    "note that for the case of orthorhombic lsmo on ngo ( 110)@xmath4 the uniaxial easy axis is aligned with the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 lattice direction and is due to strain anisotropy @xcite , in contrast to the observed anisotropy of lsmo on lsat .",
    "the difference between the two lattice directions in the orthorhombic symmetry is due to the different oxygen octahedra rotations .",
    "we therefore suspect that the microscopic origin of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in lsmo is effected by the oxygen octahedra rotations . a plausible scenario would be that the difference in octahedra rotations along the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 and [ 001]@xmath4 directions results in a different mn - o - mn bond angle ( @xmath49)in these two directions . for manganites",
    "it is well known that the bandwidth , due to the double exchange mechanism , depends on the mn - o - mn bond angle according to @xcite @xmath50 in which @xmath51 is the bandwidth , @xmath52 is proportional to the amount of octahedra rotation and @xmath53 is the mn - o distance .",
    "this suggests that for lsmo on lsat the mn - o - mn bond angle is larger in the [ 001]@xmath4 direction than in the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 direction , resulting in an increase in the bandwidth and therefore the easy axis is aligned with this direction .",
    "this explanation is also consistent with the increase of @xmath40 with film thickness . due to structural reconstructions at the interface and the surface @xcite",
    ", the oxygen octahedra rotations in the surface and interfacial regions deviate from those of the bulk of the film .",
    "the biaxial anisotropy is intrinsic to mno@xmath7 octahedra and not sensitive to the structural reconstructions . in a follow up",
    "work we will investigate the crystal structure , and especially the octahedra rotations , in more detail , in order to resolve the microscopic origin of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in lsmo .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the magnetic data is that the anisotropy is somehow related to the lattice modulations observed with the satellites in the xrd measurements .",
    "as the lattice modulations only occur in the orthorhombic [ 001]@xmath4 direction , it is not possible to discriminate between anisotropy induced by the orthorhombic crystal structure and anisotropy induced by the lattice modulations in our experiment .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the lattice modulations result in microtwins which have reduced magnetic coupling at the microtwin boundaries .",
    "the shape anisotropy of each microtwin would then be aligned with the [ 1@xmath30]@xmath4 direction , contrary to the observation of a magnetic [ 001]@xmath4 easy axis .",
    "although one would suspect that the uniaxial anisotropy would disappear for the twinned samples , this is not the case .",
    "we assume that this is due to the dominant presence of grains with one orientation .",
    "lsmo films with an orthorhombic crystal structure can be grown coherently and untwinned on cubic lsat substrates .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy of the films is described by a combination of biaxial anisotropy with easy axes along the @xmath12110@xmath13@xmath14 directions and a uniaxial anisotropy with easy axis along the [ 001]@xmath4 direction . for thicker films",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy becomes more pronounced .",
    "the uniaxial part of the anisotropy is induced by the orthorhombic symmetry of the lsmo .",
