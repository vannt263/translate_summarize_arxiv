    "in addition to understanding which phase the system would be in for dipolar interaction , which may be realized experimentally in the future , our work also clarifies a long - standing theoretical issue , namely the nature of the haldane - rezayi state .",
    "our results clearly indicate that it represents a critical point separating the strong and weak pairing d - wave quantum hall phases .",
    "this also has implication on the more general issue of whether wave functions based on non - unitary conformal field theories ( of which the haldane - rezayi state is an example ) can represent stable quantum hall phases or not .    more generally , our work represents another example that novel quantum hall states ( not possible in electronic systems ) can be realized with cold atom systems , due to the very different types of atomic interactions they afford . in particular , the dipolar interaction which is partially attractive , can be very useful in realizing other types of paired quantum hall states as well .",

    "<S> we study bilayer fermionic cold atom systems with dipolar interactions , as well as a two - component tunable pseudopotential ( tctp ) model which keeps only the zeroth and first haldane pseudopotentials , at total landau level filling factor 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results on the tctp model indicates that haldane - rezayi state describes the critical point between strong and weak d - wave pairing quantum hall phases . further increasing the attractive zeroth pseudopotentials , the system transits from the strong - pairing phase to a stripe phase , and then to a cluster phase ( or phase separation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar interaction can be mapped onto the tctp model in the strong - pairing phase , if high order pseudopotentials are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that this is indeed the case , so the strong - pairing phase exists in the cold atom system . </S>"
