( 1997 ) have demonstrated that the uncertainties in calculating the mass of dust responsible for the optically thin , thermal , submillimetre emission are : ( i ) our limited knowledge of the rest - frame mass absorption coefficient , @xmath30 , and how this quantity varies with frequency ; ( ii ) the dust temperature ( @xmath64 ) , and , finally , ( iii ) the unknown values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . unfortunately , these problems are coupled .",

    "( 1993 ) noted that there is a trade off between @xmath26 and the critical frequency at which the dust becomes optically thick , @xmath65 .",

    "1997 for more details ) .",
    "however , a conservative value for the dust mass can be obtained if the paramaters we use to estimate the dust mass are taken such that the dust mass is minimised .",
    "we further note that ( since for high-@xmath9 objects the submillimetre observations sample the rayleigh - jeans region ) the slope of the dust spectrum is not a function of temperature .",
    "our measurements of mg1019 + 0535 at 240 and 384ghz suggest that the submillimetre spectral index ( @xmath3 , where @xmath67 ) is large and positive ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we recall that the maximum allowed spectral index for self - absorption is + 2.5 .",
    "our result therefore rules out the possibility that the emission is due to self - absorbed synchrotron radiation ( chini et al.1989 ) .",

    "strong support for the thermal nature of the submillimetre emission is provided by our deep measurements at 22 and 43ghz using the vla .",
    "these show that the steepening centimetre spectral index ( figs .",
    "1 and 3 ) becomes still more negative as it approaches the millimetre domaine ; the predicted contribution at 240ghz from the dominant centimetre component lies several orders of magnitude below the measured 240-ghz flux density .    at first sight",
    "this indicates that the frequency dependence of the dust grain emissivity ( or the emissivity index , @xmath69 ) is @xmath70 , which encompasses the range normally quoted for interstellar grains ( @xmath71 ) as well as some less physical values ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , the redshift is high and the rest - frame frequency of the observed 374-ghz emission is close to the turnover of the dust spectrum , so we do in fact require a high value of @xmath69 to fit both the 240- and 384-ghz data . for @xmath73 , we find that @xmath74 .",
    "the lowest temperatures ( 35k ) are found for an optically thin solution ; the highest temperature ( 180k ) is permitted when we allow the dust to become optically thick ( say at @xmath75thz or 200@xmath49 m ) and to be constrained by the _",

    "although it is clear that our observations do not constrain stringently the dust temperature , we can make use of the usual theory ( hughes et al .",

    "we find an interesting result : these data are well matched by models which always correspond to a 0.81-gyr - old host galaxy , accounting for a non - thermal contribution ranging from 50 to 90% of the total flux density at 0.6@xmath49 m ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "according to this result , mg1019 + 0535 can not be considered a `` primaeval '' galaxy candidate because the bulk of its stellar population is significantly evolved . for @xmath15kms@xmath16mpc@xmath16 ,",
    "the formation redshift , @xmath85 , of mg1019 + 0535 is between 10 and 4 if @xmath17 and @xmath86 if @xmath87 . in the following",
    "we will refer to the first value of @xmath32 .",
    "the expected bolometric luminosity is always larger than @xmath88 ; in particular , this rises by a factor 2.5 if @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to a residual gas fraction of 2% , i.e.  to a total gas mass of about @xmath90m@xmath5 , which is well below the evans et al .",
    "( 1996 ) upper limit , with @xmath91 , a total barionic mass , @xmath92 , of around @xmath93m@xmath5 , and a star - formation rate of 800m@xmath5yr@xmath16 . in this scenario ,",
    "the hot stars are almost completely obscured by dust which , heated by their radiation field , transfers their bolometric luminosity to the far - ir wavelength regime . models with lower @xmath84 require larger @xmath92 and higher star - formation rates .",
    "we derive @xmath94 for a residual gas fraction as large as 30%  the largest allowed by models  and @xmath95 .",
    "the available data can be fully accounted for by opaque models like those already used by mazzei & de zotti ( 1994 ) to fit the spectrum of the ultraluminous galaxy iras@xmath96 . however , there is still considerable latitude for modelling .",
    "crucial constraints may be provided by ground - based submillimetre measurements and by observations with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ ; these measurements will help to define the shape of the far - ir sed , so settling the dust temperature , and the role of pahs in the near - ir spectral range .",
    "the three quasars show a sharp steepening of their synchrotron spectra between rest - frame radio and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "it is important to recall that variability may affect the flux densities of radio - loud quasars obtained at different epochs . in order to estimate the magnitude of the spectral break in the millimetre region , we evaluate the expected synchrotron flux density at @xmath22=230ghz , deriving the spectral index from the available data and extrapolating the 5-ghz radio flux densities to 1.3 mm .",
    "if two flux densities are available at the same frequency , we adopt the average value . for pks1251@xmath2407 , we use only the quasi - simultaneous 1.415-ghz data of shaver et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . for mrc1043@xmath2291 , we find that @xmath97 , and that the expected flux density at 230ghz is @xmath98mjy . for pks1251@xmath2407 and pks1354@xmath2107 ,",
    "we find @xmath99 , @xmath100 , with @xmath101mjy and @xmath102mjy , respectively . if we compare the expected flux densities with the observed upper limits , we find that @xmath103 , i.e.  the observed flux density can be more than an order of magnitude lower than expected",
    ". we can not know what fraction of this cut - off _ may _ be due to variability ; however , the typical maximum amplitude of the variability of flat - spectrum radio sources at @xmath104 1mm11 cm , over timescales of months  years , is 4060% ( jones et al .",
    "1981 and references therein ) .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that variability alone can explain the sharp cut - offs observed in the three quasars in our sample .",
    "moreover , high - frequency spectral turnovers have been often observed in radio - loud quasars at lower redshifts ( chini et al .",
    "1989 ; antonucci , barvainis & alloin 1990 ; klein et al .",
    "in particular , the spectral break occurs in radio - loud quasars with either flat or steep radio spectra , whereas in bl  lac objects the submillimetre flux densities lie on an extrapolation of the radio spectrum ( knapp & patten 1991 ) .",
    "our observations show a turnover at log@xmath105 , but the lack of further spectral information does not allow us to infer whether the steepening of the synchrotron  sub - mm spectra is related to thermal emission from dust peaking at the higher frequencies .",
    "it is important to recall that the question of dust in high - redshift , radio - loud quasars is very relevant to unification models ( see baker & hunstead 1995 for a discussion of dust in radio - loud quasars ) and to test the hypothesis that many quasars may be missed in optical surveys ( see webster et al .",
    "future observations with _ iso _ and scuba will extend the sed coverage to higher frequencies for a large number of objects .",
    "we have presented observations of the rest - frame far - infrared continuum of a small sample of radio - loud agn ( 4 radio galaxies and 3 quasars ) with @xmath106 .",
    "one of the main findings is the detection of thermal continuum emission from the radio galaxy mg1019 + 0535 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is particularly important since it confirms the suggestion that its weak ly@xmath3 emission is probably due to dust extinction .",
    "we attempt to estimate the temperature of the dust in order to derive the dust total mass , but the present data data do not allow us to constrain stringently the range of possible temperatures .",
    "however , we estimate that the total dust mass should be of order @xmath107m@xmath5 for temperatures @xmath108k .",
    "the overall rest - frame uv ",
    "fir sed can be accounted for by a relatively evolved host galaxy ( age @xmath430.8gyr ) experiencing an episode of vigorous star formation .",
    "the radio galaxy 1243 + 036 ( @xmath109 ) , on the other hand , seems to have a lower amount of dust and molecular gas than those active galaxies that have so far been detected at high redshifts , indicating that the properties of the ism in active objects at @xmath10 can be rather inhomogeneous .    finally , the three flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars ( @xmath106 ) observed at 1.3 mm show evidence of a spectral turnover at high frequencies .",
    "our data do not allow us to understand what fraction of the turnover is due to the effects of variability , but we conclude that variability can not be the only cause .",
    "we acknowledge the referee , a. omont , for the useful suggestions .",
    "we thank raphael moreno and goeran sandell who did some of the observations in service mode at the iram and jcmt telescopes respectively , and roberto fanti for useful discussions .",
