    "most of the dla systems in our sample ( with total neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath7hi@xmath8 ) were observed at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) with uves between 2000 and 2003 to search for h@xmath9 molecules at @xmath10 ( petitjean et al .",

    "one notable characteristics of this large dataset is that it samples well both the low and the high ends of the dla metallicity distribution , from [ x / h@xmath11\\approx -2.6 $ ] up to about half of solar .    for each dla system",
    ", we also measured the velocity widths of the metal absorption line profiles .",
    "low - ionization transition lines that are not strongly saturated were selected ( see prochaska & wolfe 1997 ; wolfe & prochaska 1998 ) . for high - ionization lines , the velocity width could be dominated by extended galaxy halos and galactic winds .",
    "we calculated the velocity width of the selected profiles as the second moment of the distribution of apparent optical depth along these profiles .",
    "the correlation between dla low - ionization metal line width and average metallicity , as observed in fig .  1 , over more than two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity , can be understood as the consequence of an underlying mass - metallicity relation for the galaxies responsible for dla absorption lines .",

    "while the slope of the dla velocity - metallicity relation is the same within uncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample , there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation with decreasing redshift .",

    "_ this suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass ( resp .",

    "haehnelt et al .

    "they found @xmath21 . according to haehnelt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the luminosity function of @xmath22 galaxies can be reproduced if a simple linear scaling of the luminosity with the mass of the dark matter halos is assumed , i.e. , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the galaxy apparent @xmath25-band magnitude and @xmath26 . using our linear best - fit to the velocity - metallicity relation for @xmath1 dla systems ( @xmath27 ) , we get : @xmath28=-0.18(\\pm 0.02)m_b -4.70(\\pm 0.18)-0.18k_b,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-correction in the @xmath25-band , which should be positive .",

    "[ eq1 ] implies that the more than two orders of magnitude spread in dla metallicity reflects a more than ten magnitudes spread in dla galaxy luminosity . in other words ,",
