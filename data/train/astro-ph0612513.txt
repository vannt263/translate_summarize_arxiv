    "the availability of the infrared array camera ( irac ) of the spitzer space telescope has recently made it possible to measure the rest - frame optical light from high - redshift galaxies , up to redshifts of @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". indeed , in just the past few years large numbers of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and ly-@xmath0-emitting galaxies ( laes ) have been studied , and irac data have enabled mass and age estimates for these objects to be derived . historically , lbgs and laes are two distinct classes of objects that have been observed over a very wide range of redshifts , thanks in large part to the fact that they are relatively straight - forward to identify by virtue of the presence of either a significant break in their spectral light distribution ( lbgs ) or the presence of a strong ly-@xmath0 emission line ( laes ) . as the number of known @xmath8 lbgs and laes increased over the past few years (",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; references therein ) , the mass estimates of these objects have remained somewhat uncertain .",
    "nevertheless observations have shown that some high redshift lbgs tend to already be quite massive ( @xmath9 ) and to be a few hundred million years old .",
    "the relatively large masses of these objects at a time when the universe was still quite young has been taken as an indication that these objects have had a star formation history ( sfh ) that allowed for most of their stellar mass to have formed early on .",
    "mass estimates for laes , on the other hand , have been much more difficult to assess .",
    "either the laes are very young , as indicated by the strong ly-@xmath0  line emission or the faintness of the continuum , for some other reason ( e.g. , extinction ) makes it difficult to derive mass estimates using their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as is done for lbgs .",
    "@xcite , for example , required the use of a stack of 18 field laes to infer an average mass of @xmath10 .",
    "this low estimated mass , and the low luminosity of these objects in the rest - frame optical , is exactly what makes estimating their masses somewhat more difficult than in the case of lbgs .",
    "while the latter are usually selected based on broad band observations and colors , hence ensuring that these objects have bright continuum luminosities , laes selected based on the presence of ly-@xmath0  emission can be significantly fainter in the observed bands .",
    "for the handful of laes for which detections by irac have been obtained , a large mass in older populations has been derived @xcite .",
    "there is however a _ detection bias _ here : the only published mass / age estimates so far are the ones for which irac detections exist ; that is , they would tend to have significant old stellar populations .    in this paper , we investigate the population of high redshift laes in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a field that is relatively small ( 11 @xmath11 ) but has the advantage of having been observed down to very faint magnitudes , and in a wide range of wavelengths . our lae sample makes no _ apriori _ assumptions as to the specific redshift of these sources , or as to whether these objects have been detected in all of the available data .",
    "we therefore aimed at reaching down to potentially fainter objects , and over a wider range of redshift , than previously done .",
    "section [ observations ] describes the object selection and the available data . in section [ phot ] , we summarize the broad - band luminosities of these objects , while in sections [ morphology ] , [ popsynth ] , and [ ages ] we discuss the morphology and sed - fitting process and",
    "provide mass and age estimates of the hudf laes , irrespective of whether these objects were detected in the spitzer irac bands or not .",
    "the sources described in this paper were selected from the grapes survey ( grism acs program for extragalactic science , pi : s. malhotra ; see description in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a slitless grism spectroscopic survey using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . the grapes project obtained low resolution spectra of 1421 objects in the hudf down to a continuum level of @xmath12 mag .",
    "the grapes grism observations proved able to detect emission lines with fluxes as low as @xmath13 in objects as faint as @xmath14 mag in the continuum .",
    "a complete list of grapes emission line objects was published in @xcite and contains 115 objects with redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "grapes identified a total of 9  laes at @xmath16 ( listed in table [ objecttable ] ) .",
    "we show individual spectra of these nine sources in figure [ specs ] . in most cases ,",
    "the spectra shown are a narrow extraction of the grapes program data . in two cases , where the galaxy is comparatively large , we show a wider extraction ( 5225 and 6139 ) . finally , in another two cases ( 631 and 9040 ) , the grapes data have relatively few uncontaminated roll angles , and we therefore instead plot spectra from the subsequent pears program ( probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically ; pi : s. malhotra ) , which reobserved the hudf in four new roll angles . the emission lines in the largest objects ( 6139 , 9040 , and especially 5225 ) are not shown to best advantage in these one - dimensional extractions , because the spatial extent of the object gives a wide line - spread function in the slitless data , which tends to blur the line .",
    "detailed two dimensional images of the observations of object 5225 are available in @xcite .",
    "the grapes emission line object selection was performed automatically using an emission - line search code and methodology described in details in @xcite .",
    "some of the objects shown in table [ objecttable ] have rather faint emission lines .",
    "all lines were nevertheless significant at the level of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of grapes position angles in which the line was detected , and where @xmath19 was required for inclusion in @xcite . for an emission line object to be classified as a ly-@xmath0  galaxy , it had to also have ( 1 ) no other emission lines in the g800l grism wavelength coverage  plus civ @xmath201549 emission did not occur in the grapes data set . ] and ( 2 ) broad band photometry in the hudfimages consistent with a lyman break at the redshift corresponding to the ly-@xmath0  line identification .",
    "given less accurate photometry , a ly-@xmath0  line plus lyman break may be difficult to distinguish from an [ oii ] 3727  line plus 4000  break @xcite .",
    "fortunately , even the faintest object in our sample is detected witha signal - to - noise ( s / n ) greater than 5 two filters , and the rest are detected with ( s / n)@xmath21 in two or more filters .",
    "this deep photometry shows that every object has a break where the flux is attenuated by a factor of at least 15 ( see table [ phottable ] ) .",
    "the strengths of these breaks are several times greater than would be expected from the d(4000 ) break , and are much more consistent with the decrement expected from absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) for objects at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "also , although it was not part of the grapes lae selection process , these objects typically have very blue observed @xmath23 colors ( corresponding to @xmath24 rest - frame near - uv colors ) , based on the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) hudf observations @xcite .",
    "this makes it highly unlikely that any large amount of extinction is present in these objects and so further supports the interpretation of their colors as a lyman break at high redshift .",
    "further spectroscopy could certainly help secure the redshifts and ly-@xmath0  line identification for these objects .",
    "for example , higher resolution ( @xmath25 ) could help by verifying that the lines show the asymmetry characteristic of ly-@xmath0  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , bluer optical coverage could confirm the absence of other lines , and infrared coverage could confirm the presence of [ oii ] @xmath26   at the same redshift as ly-@xmath0  . however , all present evidence points to these objects being ly-@xmath0  sources at @xmath27 . +",
    "the hudf , which lies within the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) field , has the advantage of having been observed in a wide range of wavelengths . in this paper , we take advantage of the availability of hst nicmos , vlt isaac , and spitzer irac observations of this field , as well as the list of nine spectroscopically identified grapes laes . at the redshifts considered in this paper ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "combining these observations together allows us to examine these objects at rest - frame wavelengths of approximately @xmath28 , and down to unprecedented depths .",
    "the acs observations , using the , , , and  bands each reach down to approximately 29 mag , with a final mosaic image resolution of 0.030  @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "nicmos was used to observe a large sub - set of the hudf in the near infrared @xcite using both the j and h bands . while the resolution of the nicmos observations ( @xmath30 @xmath29 ) is lower than that of the acs observations , it is nevertheless high enough to clearly separate laes from their neighbors .",
    "we additionally used the isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ) ks - band observations of the hudf , but the depth of these data is relatively shallow ( 25.1 mag ) and with a resolution limited by atmospheric seeing ( @xmath31  ) .",
    "lastly , the hudf was also observed in the infrared using irac as part of the goods legacy program ( m. dickinson et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",

    "flux estimates were obtained using simple aperture photometry so that we could set meaningful upper limits to the flux of undetected sources , while the local noise level was estimated using a small annulus surrounding each source . how we specifically dealt with non detections is explained in more detail in section [ popsynth ] .",

    "we compared these measured fluxes with sextractor measurements and found that the two agreed very well , to better than 1% .",
    "we used an aperture of 1.25  with the nicmos data and applied aperture corrections of 1.06 and 1.09 in the j and h bands , respectively ( nicmos support 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "when measuring fluxes from the ground based isaac data , we used an aperture size that was twice as large as the size of the source , as measured in the acs z - band image and after accounting for a seeing disk of 0.5  .",
    "as discussed above , the irac data both have a lower resolution and suffer from a higher level of contamination from neighboring sources than the rest of our data .",
    "the irac photometric measurement process was therefore more involved than when using acs , nicmos , and isaac data .",
    "since many of the grapes laes were only marginally resolved in the irac observations , and because contaminating flux from nearby objects would cause flux measurements to be systematically higher ( leading to systematically higher masses , as we discuss further below ) , we developed a technique to remove as much of the contaminating flux as possible .",
    "our approach consisted of performing two - dimensional general srsic profile fits of all neighboring sources ( whose positions were derived using the acs @xmath35 object catalog ) using the program galfit @xcite .",
    "the centermost 4  region surrounding each lae was masked and therefore not used during the fitting process .",
    "each object was individually and interactively processed until the best possible fit was achieved , while avoiding over - subtraction of the flux contribution from the neighboring sources . following this ,",
    "the two dimensional models of the light profiles of nearby sources were subtracted from the original irac images and aperture photometry was performed on the resultant images , just as we did with the acs , nicmos , and isaac data .",
    "the reduced @xmath36 of the galfit fitting of the nearby sources was usually near unity .",
    "in the few cases where nearby sources were not perfectly fitted using a srsic profile , we made sure that we did not end up over - subracting the amount of light contributed by these nearby objects . at the presumed redshifts of these objects , undersubtracting the contaminating light produced by nearby object ultimately results in an overestimate of the rest - frame optical flux of the grapes laes .",
    "this , in turn , can only lead to an inflation of the stellar mass estimates .",
    "we used a fixed aperture of 3  for all irac data and applied aperture corrections of 1.78 and 1.77 to irac channel 1 and channel 2 , respectively ( b. mobasher 2006 , private communication ) .",

    "we only used bands where an object was detected , and in addition , we excluded observations in the  band , which we knew to be contaminated by potentially a large , but uncertain , amount of ly-@xmath0  emission .",
    "we did not attempt to simply correct the broad band  measurements using the fluxes listed in table [ objecttable ] , because of the large uncertainties associated with the aperture correction applied to the measured slitless spectroscopic fluxes .",
    "we also excluded the  and  bands that we knew to be strongly affected by igm absorption .",
    "+ this fitting process , while determining a mass estimate for each object , does not however take into account any of the upper limit estimates in cases of a non - detection .",
    "we incorporated this additional information in two distinct ways .",
    "first , we computed the kendall rank correlation value for censored data sets @xcite between individual models ( each scaled to best fit bands where the object was detected ) and the observations .",
    "this method allowed us to quantitatively determine how badly upper limit constraints might be violated by a particular model , but it has the drawback of not being able to take into account the errors in the flux measurements .",
    "it has the additional drawback of producing a goodness - of - fit estimator that is strongly quantized because of the limited number of available measurements .",
    "while models that strongly violated upper limit constraints could be identified , many of our models led to similar kendall correlation values , making it difficult to select one model over another . we therefore also relied on another method based on a more generalized version of the error - weighted @xmath89 described above .",
    "this method takes into account upper limit estimates and assigns a @xmath89 penalty when a model predicts flux values that exceeds established upper limit values ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the value of this additive penalty is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the probability that the actual flux is less than @xmath93 if the flux is assumed to be normally distributed with mean @xmath94 and width @xmath93 , where @xmath93 is the flux detection limit of the data and @xmath94 is the flux of the model in that bandpass .",
    "this method was used in @xcite where it is described in more details .",
    "we found a good agreement between the kendall rank method and the @xmath90 method , and both methods could indeed be used to reject models that over predicted fluxes in non detected bands .",
    "however , and because the @xmath90 method allowed us to take flux measurements into account , which was crucial for some data points ( such as the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio isaac ks observations ) , we eventually relied more on the @xmath90 method .",
    "models were thus rejected by first computing individual @xmath90 values and then subsequently determining whether a given @xmath90 value was an indication that a model was a statistically bad fit to the observations .",
    "the exact cut - off value of @xmath90 used to reject a set of models was determined separately for each object since the number of bands used to compute @xmath90 differed from one object to the next .",
    "we defined @xmath95  as the probability of obtaining a value of @xmath90 as large as the observed @xmath96 if the observations really did follow the assumed distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we then assumed that observations and models differed _ significantly _ when @xmath97 was less than 5% ( @xmath98 level ) and rejected the corresponding model on the basis that it was a poor fit to the observations .",
    "models that could fit the observations could often be identified , using one of the three sfh scenarios that we considered .",
    "some notable exceptions is object 5183 , that we found to be somewhat poorly fitted by all of the models that we generated . cut - off values of @xmath95  were therefore loosened for these two objects , and hence the selected best fits for these objects have higher @xmath90 values than the rest of the grapes laes . + it is important to stress that we found that properly accounting for the non detection of an object , particularly in the irac bands , was crucial when attempting to either include or exclude a particular set of models .",
    "the irac fluxes , especially the ones that we corrected for the effect of neighbor contamination , allowed us to determine an upper limit to the optical rest frame flux emitted by the source .",
    "we found that such an upper limit imposed a strict upper limit to the number of older stars that could be accounted for in that object .",
    "this in turn allowed us to exclude a large subset of our original models . in the following section , we examine the mass estimates for the grapes laes and further summarize the range of acceptable input bc03 model parameters .",
    "colors of the grapes laes ( filles squares ) in z-3.6@xmath99 vs. i - z space .",
    "these objects appear to be extremely blue , similarly to previously identified high - redshift laes ( circles ) from @xcite , and significantly bluer than the i - dropout lbgs ( open squares ) from @xcite . in the left panel ,",
    "colors of a z=5 single - burst galaxy are shown ( solid line ) for comparison with ages ( shown in gyr ) .",
    "this points to the grapes laes potentially being very young , low - extinction objects .",
    "similarly , assuming low values of extinction ( right ) , these sources appear to be fainter in the rest - frame optical ( @xmath100 ) than either the lbgs or laes that were previously observed at these high redshifts.,width=672 ]",
    "as expected with such a large number of input parameters , we found that a wide range of bc03 models provided an adequate fit to the observations .",
    "while a best fitting model could always be identified by simply selecting the model with the lowest value of @xmath90 ( which we call the best fit model ) , we also determined the largest mass estimate and the oldest age estimate for each grapes lae by simply examining the subset of bc03 models , and hence the corresponding parameters that went into creating these models , that were not rejected at the @xmath98 level .",
    "the model producing the best fit to observations was not always the most massive , or the oldest , model that properly fitted the observations .",
    "we defined the maximum - mass models and the maximum - age models as those with the largest mass and age , respectively , that were good fits to the observations ( e.g. , @xmath101 level or higher when possible , or highest possible confidence otherwise ) .    table [ bestssp0 ] summarizes our results using the ssp sfh scenario .",
    "this is a simple model that assumes that all of the stars were created in a single burst event and then simply passively evolved . examining the best - fit models shown in table [ bestssp0 ] , we find that all laes appear to have very young stellar populations ( a few times @xmath102 ) and low stellar masses , with only one object ( 6139 ) having a mass estimate that exceeds @xmath103 .",
    "extinction values were consistently low , while the metallicities were found to be subsolar in most cases . however , it should be noted that metallicity was not well constrained and that a wide range of metallicities were found to be acceptable .",
    "naturally , a wider range of models were found to properly fit the observations and the masses and ages of the grapes laes could possibly be somewhat larger than those of the best - fit models , as shown on the last two columns of table [ bestssp0 ] .",
    "similarly , a range of age estimates were found to be acceptable . yet",
    ", we found that acceptable ages remained below a few tens of millions years , while masses remained below a few times @xmath104 . note that none of our bc03 models successfully fitted object 5183 , ot 9040 [ @xmath95  @xmath105 , and that all of our bc03 models could hence formally be rejected at the @xmath106 level . in these cases ,",
    "table [ bestssp0 ] shows the model with the highest possible confidence level .",
    "+ table [ bestexp ] is similar to table [ bestssp0 ] but shows the results obtained using the exp sfh scenario . in this scenario ,",
    "star formation occurred in a burst that was not instantaneous but instead exponentially decayed as a function of time , with an e - folding time of @xmath79 .",
    "unlike the previous ssp model , not all of the stars have the same age in this scenario , and this scenario allows for an increasingly larger proportion of stars to be older as the galaxy ages .",
    "the exp models would therefore be expected to result in slightly larger age and mass estimates than the ssp scenario . as shown in table [ bestexp ] , this is indeed marginally the case .",
    "the maximum ages shown in table [ bestexp ] are found to be in some cases up to 10 times larger than those produced using the ssp scenario .",
    "the maximum masses , in most cases , did not exceed a few times @xmath103 and were only slightly larger than the maximum masses derived using the ssp model .",
    "the mass and ages estimates derived using our third sfh scenario ( 2bp ) are shown in table [ bestssp ] . by design , the two - burst scenario was conceived to allow us to fit the seds of objects that are intrinsically very blue in their rest - frame uv light yet appear to produce a significant amount of light in the rest - frame optical .",
    "the 2bp scenario allows for the presence of two distinct stellar populations , one young and blue and another older and therefore relatively redder .",
    "this scenario should therefore provide better fits to observations with both large acs and irac fluxes .",
    "it should also be expected to yield higher mass estimates in cases of high upper flux limits in the irac bands .",
    "this scenario is similar to the @xcite maximally old population model .",
    "as shown in table [ bestssp ] , the age estimates derived from the best fit to the data are in some cases significantly larger than those derived using either the ssp or exp scenario .",
    "this is of course achieved by allowing a significant fraction of the stellar population of the galaxy to be in the form of a maximally old ( @xmath107 ) population of stars .",
    "as previously observed , extinction values were low , and we found that lower extinction values were generally preferred using this sfh scenario .",
    "but we did find that a range of extinction values and burst mass ratios could fit the observations , leading to larger mass estimates , as long as at a few times @xmath108 of the galaxy mass was in the form of a young stellar population with an age of @xmath109 . the younger stellar population accounts for the significant uv flux in these objects , while the much older stars ( often up to the age of the universe at the object s redshift ) account for an increase of the total mass of the galaxy by a factor of about 2 , when compared with the maximum - mass ssp results .",
    "figure [ plots ] shows the best - fit 2bp model for each grapes lae ( solid lines ) , as well as the maximum - mass selected from models that were not rejected at the @xmath101 level ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that , as mentioned above , two of the grapes lae sources ( 5183 , and 9040 ) are not very well fitted by any of our chosen models .",
    "it is worth addressing again the possibility that one , or both objects could be a low redshift interloper .",
    "however , and as pointed out in section [ observations ] , every single one of these three objects has a very significant color break , consistent with what we would expect from igm absorption at high redshifts , as well as very blue observed -  colors .",
    "we performed additional simulations of the -  and -  colors of these objects that would be expected if they were at much lower ( @xmath110 ) redshifts , assuming that the detected line was not ly-@xmath0  but [ oiii ] @xmath111 , and that the color break was the result of the @xmath112 break .",
    "we concluded that the presence of a strong @xmath112 break , together with a very blue rest - frame near - uv color , can not be properly accounted for anything but a young stellar population at high redshift , independently of the amount of extinction present , the metallicity of the stellar population , and the age of the stellar population .",
    "the latter led us to favor the interpretation that objects 5183 and 9040 are indeed very faint high redshift ly-@xmath0  emitters .",
    "we recognize however that future high - resolution spectroscopy will be required in order to unequivocally address this issue .",

    "<S> high redshift galaxies selected on the basis of strong ly-@xmath0 emission tend to be young and have small physical sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by analyzing the spectral energy distribution of nine ly-@xmath0-emitting galaxies ( laes ) at @xmath1 in the hubble ultra deep field . </S>",
    "<S> rest - frame uv to optical @xmath2 luminosities , or upper limits , are used to constrain old stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we derive best fit , as well as maximally massive and maximally old , properties of all nine objects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these faint and distant objects are all very young , most likely only a few million years old , and not massive , the mass in stars being @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> deep spitzer infrared array camera observations of these objects , even in cases where the object was not detected , proved crucial in constraining the masses of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the space density of these objects , @xmath4 , is comparable to previously reported space densities of laes at moderate - to - high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> these ly-@xmath0 galaxies show modest star formation rates of @xmath5 , which is nevertheless strong enough to have allowed them to assemble their stellar mass in less than a few million years . </S>",
    "<S> these sources appear to have small physical sizes , usually smaller than @xmath6 , and are also rather concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> they are likely to be some of the least massive and youngest high redshift galaxies observed to date . </S>"
