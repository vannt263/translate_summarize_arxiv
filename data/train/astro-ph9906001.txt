    "recent observational studies with the sub - millimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) ( holland et al . 1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope have revealed possible candidates of heavily dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies at intermediate and high redshift , which could be counterparts of low redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",

    "although optical morphology of these sub - millimeter galactic sources should be treated with caution owing to the absence of high resolution sub - mm imaging capability ( richards 1999 ) , more than 50 % of those are suggested to show the indication of galactic interaction and merging ( smail et al .",
    "the huge amount of molecular gas ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) derived from co emission and the inferred large star formation rate ( @xmath4 ) in a few sub - millimeter extragalactic sources ( e.g. smmj14011 + 0252 ) are suggested to be consistent with the scenario that the formation of some intermediate and high redshift elliptical galaxies is associated with galaxy mergers with their starburst activities heavily hidden by dust extinction ( frayer et al .",

    "although low redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) are generally considered to be ongoing galaxy mergers with the triggered prominent nuclear activities ( starburst or agn ) heavily obscured by dust ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , the origin of the faint scuba sources is not so clearly understood . in this letter , we numerically investigate both morphological and photometric properties of dusty starburst galaxy mergers in an explicitly self - consistent manner and thereby demonstrate when and how a gas - rich merger between two spirals becomes an ulirg .",
    "we particularly discuss the origin of very faint and compact hst optical morphology of possible host galaxies of some faint scuba sources recently revealed by smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) by demonstrating how intermediate and high redshift dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies can be seen by the hst wfpc2 and nicmos ( nic2 ) .",
    "the most remarkable difference in investigating photometric evolution of dusty galaxies between the present model and previous one - zone models ( e.g. , mazzei , xu , & de zotti 1992 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1994 ; guiderdoni et al .",
    "1998 ) is that we derive spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies based on the result of numerical simulations that can follow both dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the numerical techniques for solving galactic chemodynamical and photometric evolution are given in bekki & shioya ( 1999a , b ) , and accordingly we describe only briefly the present numerical model of dusty starburst galaxy mergers here .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies with equal mass by using fall - efstathiou model ( 1980 ) .",
    "the total mass and the size of a progenitor disk are 6.0 @xmath5 @xmath2 @xmath3 and 17.5 kpc , respectively .",
    "the collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium with the initial total mass equal to @xmath6 @xmath2 @xmath3 is modeled by the sticky particle method ( @xcite ) .",
    "star formation is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless new stellar particles according to the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with the exponent of 2.0 .",
    "chemical enrichment through star formation during galaxy merging is assumed to proceed both locally and instantaneously in the present study .",
    "the fraction of gas returned to interstellar medium in each stellar particle and the chemical yield are 0.2 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "initial metallicity @xmath7 for each stellar and gaseous particle in a given galactic radius @xmath8 ( kpc ) from the center of a disk is given according to the observed relation @xmath9 of typical late - type disk galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) .",
    "mean ages of old stellar components initially in a merger progenitor disk at the redshift z=0.4 , 1.0 , and 1.5 are assumed to be 7.14 , 3.80 , and 2.46 gyr , respectively .",
    "the orbital plane of a galaxy merger is assumed to be the same as @xmath10-@xmath11 plane and the initial distance between the center of mass of merger progenitor disks is 140 kpc .",
    "two disks in the merger are assumed to encounter each other parabolically with the pericentric distance of 17.5 kpc .",
    "it is assumed in the present study that the sed of a model galaxy is a sum of the sed of stellar particles .",
    "we first calculate dust extinction of star light for @xmath12 stellar particle and dust temperature for @xmath12 gaseous particle , based on the three dimensional spacial distribution of stellar and gaseous particles .",
    "we then sum each stellar particle s sed corrected by dust extinction and the dust re - emission of each gaseous particle .",
    "the method to derive the dust extinction and re - emission for each particle is described as follows .",
    "absorption of star light of a stellar particle is modeled according to the following reddening formulation ( black 1987 ; mazzei et al .",
    "1992 ) ; @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are gaseous column density and gaseous metallicity , respectively . using the derived redding @xmath16 and extinction law by cardelli et al . ( 1989 ) , we adopt the so - called screen model and calculate the absorption of the stellar particle . by assuming the modified black body radiation with the emissivity ( @xmath17 ) law @xmath18 , we determine the dust temperature of a gas particle such that total energy flux of dust absorption is equal to that of dust re - emission .",
    "we here do not include the albedo for dust grains , which means that only stars and new stars heat dust . for calculating the sed of each stellar particle with a given age and metallicity , we use the spectral library gissel96 which is the latest version of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) . using the derived sed ,",
    "we investigate how dust - enshrouded starburst galaxy mergers at z=0.4 , 1.0 , and 1.5 can be seen in the hst .",
    "the method to construct the synthesized hst images of galactic morphology in the present study is basically the same as that described by mihos ( 1995 ) . in the followings ,",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are set to be 50 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 and 0.5 respectively .",
    "figure 1 and 2 describe the time evolution of star formation rate and the rest - frame sed in a dusty gas - rich major galaxy merger at z=1.0 and the mass distribution of stellar and gaseous components of the merger at the epoch of the maximum secondary starburst , @xmath22 gyr , respectively . from now on ,",
    "the time @xmath23 represents the time that has elapsed since the two disks begin to merge at each redshift .",
    "as is shown in figure 1 , star formation rate in the present prograde - retrograde merger becomes maximum ( @xmath24 ) at @xmath22 gyr , when two disks of the merger become very close to suffer from final violent relaxation .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with those in mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) .",
    "the sed at @xmath22 gyr in figure 1 is rather similar to the observed sed of typical ulirgs , which implies that the present dusty starburst merger model can be observed as an ulirg in the late of galaxy merging .",
    "the sed of a dusty merger depends on encounter parameters in such a way that a prograde - retrograde merger shows stronger infrared re - emission in the merger late phase than prograde - prograde one ( bekki & shioya 1999b ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that both new stars and gas are more centrally concentrated than old stellar components , which means that star light from new stars formed by secondary massive starburst are more heavily obscured by dusty interstellar medium than that of old stellar components .",
    "these results in figure 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that starburst population in the merger is very heavily obscured by dusty interstellar medium ( @xmath25 mag ) and consequently the dust re - emission in far - infrared ranges becomes very strong at the maximum starburst ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the reasons for this heavy dust extinction are firstly that column density of dusty interstellar medium becomes extremely high owing to the strong central accumulation of gas and secondly that the central gaseous metallicity , which is a measure of total amount of dust , also becomes rather large ( @xmath27 ) because of efficient and rapid chemical evolution in galaxy merging with secondary starburst . the galaxy merger 0.05 gyr before and after the maximum starburst does not show the sed characteristics of ulirgs , which suggests that the time - scale during which the merger remnant can be observed as an ulirg is very short ( less than 0.1 gyr ) .",
    "owing to the heavy dust extinction , the merger shows very red rest - frame color @xmath28=0.97 for a starburst galaxy .",
    "figure 3 shows how the optical and near - infrared morphology of this ulirg merger at @xmath22 gyr can be observed by the hst wfpc2 and nicmos if it locates at the redshift z=0.4 , 1.0 , and 1.5 ( see also figure 2 for the raw image of the merger ) .",
    "outer diffuse large arc - like structure composed mainly of old stars , which is discernibly seen in the upper left part of figure 2 , can not be seen even in the merger at z=0.4 .",
    "tidal feature indicative of major galaxy merging can be discernibly seen at z=0.4 and can not be seen at all at z=1.0 and 1.5 .",
    "the faint and compact morphology of the present merger remnant at z=1.0 and 1.5 is similar to some possible faint optical counterparts of the first scuba sources observed by smail et al .",
    "we furthermore stress that it is hard to observe the tidal feature even in the hst image with the exposure time equal to @xmath29 sec corresponding to that for the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "these results imply that it is not so easy task to clarify the origin of high redshift ulirgs ( @xmath30 ) solely by optical and near - infrared hst morphological studies ; if the formation of high redshift ulirgs is closely associated with major galaxy merging , even the deepest existing hst surveys have some difficulties in proving that .",
    "the 850 @xmath31 sub - millimeter energy flux of the ulirg merger is found to be 10.85 mjy for z=1.0 and 2.36 mjy for z=1.5 . considering the flux value of the merger at z=1.0 and 1.5 exceeding the observed scuba flux @xmath32 mjy by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and @xmath33 by barger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and faint compact morphology of the merger , a high redshift dust - enshrouded starburst merger ( z@xmath341.0 ) can be observed as a very compact scuba source .",
    "furthermore the apparently compact remnant shows very red @xmath35 color ( 4.70 mag for z=1.0 and 4.86 for z=1.5 ) for its @xmath36 band magnitude ( 21.26 mag for z=1.0 and and 22.42 for z=1.5 ) , which implies an evolutionary link between dusty mergers and the high redshift extremely red objects ( eros ) .",
    "the present model describes the detectability of only @xmath37 merger model with the initial disk mass @xmath38 = 6.0 @xmath5 @xmath2 @xmath3 in the @xmath39 optics of the hst .",
    "accordingly we must stress that the detectability of tidal feature of a high redshift ulirg in the hst can depend on mass and luminosity of a merger and furthermore that the future improved hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) is expected to reveal the more detailed morphology of a high redshift ulirg .",
    "our numerical results have demonstrated that a dust - enshrouded starburst merger can be observed as a scuba source with faint and compact morphology at high redshift .",
    "the present results furthermore provide clues to the understanding of the evolutionary link between the extremely red objects ` ero ' ( e.g. , elston , rieke , & rieke 1988 ) and the present day elliptical galaxies .",
    "recent observational studies have revealed that ero j 164502 + 4626.4 ( hr 10 ) is not a red elliptical galaxy passively evolving at high redshift but a dust - enshrouded starburst galaxy at redshift z=1.44 ( cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ; dey et al .",
    "peculiar morphological properties in rest - frame far - red and near - uv range , the large 850 @xmath31 energy flux , and the inferred huge star formation rate in this hr 10 are qualitatively consistent with the present numerical results of dusty starburst mergers , which implies that @xmath40 eros are dusty starburst major mergers and thus evolve eventually into the present - day elliptical galaxies .",
    "then , what fraction of the present - day ellipticals have experienced the past dusty ero phase ? considering both the very short time - scale ( less than 0.1 gyr in the present study ) during which dusty mergers can be identified as eros and the high surface density of eros ( 0.14 @xmath41 for eros with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) derived by beckwith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the discovery of the possible dusty starburst galaxy merger hr 10 implies that the fraction is likely to be fairly large .",
    "furthermore , the increase of number fraction of apparently interacting / merging galaxies with redshift in the hdf ( driver et al .",
    "1998 ) , the very small fraction ( less than 8 % ) of early - type e / s0 galaxies in the hdf ( marleau & simard 1998 ) , and the observed high surface density of eros ( beckwith et al . 1998 ; dey et al . 1998 ) combine to motivate us to interpret that a sizable fraction of the present - day elliptical galaxies were previously ongoing major mergers with dusty starburst at intermediate and high redshift .",
    "however , spectroscopic studies of eros have not been so accumulated yet which can reveal unambiguously the redshift of eros thus determine whether eros are really dusty starburst galaxies or such high redshift red elliptical galaxies as have been recently discovered by the vlt ( bentez et al",
    "future extensive spectrophotometric studies which can reveal whether the extremely red colors of eros result from dust effects or from galaxy aging will determine the relative importance of major galaxy merging in the formation of high redshift eros .",
