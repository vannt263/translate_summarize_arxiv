    "the future and ultimate fate of the universe can be predicted given a knowledge of the recent expansion history of the universe ( assuming the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on scales greater than the current horizon size ) .",
    "this recent expansion history can be probed by studying the coordinate distance to sources at redshifts of one or two ; the coordinate distance is equivalent to the luminosity distance or angular size distance multiplied by factors of @xmath4 .",
    "the advantage of determining cosmological parameters using the coordinate distance ( luminosity distance or angular size distance ) is that this distance depends on global , or average , cosmological parameters .",
    "it is independent of the way the matter is distributed spatially , of the power spectrum of density fluctuations , of whether the matter is biased relative to the light , and of the form or nature of the dark matter ( assuming that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ) .",
    "it was shown in 1994 that powerful double - lobed radio galaxies provide a modified standard yardstick that can be used to determine global cosmological parameters ( daly 1994 , 1995 ) , much like supernovae can be used as modified standard candles .",
    "the method was applied and discussed in detail by guerra & daly ( 1996 , 1998 ) , guerra ( 1997 ) , and daly , guerra , & wan ( 1998 ) who found that the data strongly favor a low density universe ; a universe with @xmath5 was ruled out at 97.5 % confidence .",
    "it was shown by daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) that the radio properties of these sources could be used not only to study global cosmological parameters , but also to determine the ambient gas density , beam power , mach number of lobe advance , and ambient gas temperature of the sources and their environments .",
    "the characteristics of the sources and their environments are presented and discussed in a series of papers ( wellman & daly 1996a , b ; wan , daly , & wellman 1996 ; daly 1996 ; wellman , daly , & wan 1997a , b ; wan & daly 1998a , b ; wan , daly , & guerra 2000 ) .",
    "radio maps of six powerful double - lobed radio galaxies were extracted from the very large array ( vla ) archives at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , and analyzed in detail .",
    "new results on global cosmological parameters , ambient gas densities , and beam powers are presented here .",
    "the expanded sample is described in  2 .",
    "the new results are presented in  3 .",
    "the implications of the results are discussed in  4 .",
    "each powerful extended radio galaxy ( also known as a `` classical double '' ) has a characteristic size , @xmath6 , that predicts the lobe - lobe separation at the end of the source lifetime ( daly 1994 , 1995 ; guerra & daly 1998 ) . the parameters needed to compute the characteristic size are the lobe propagation velocity , @xmath7 , the lobe width , @xmath8 , and the lobe magnetic field strength , @xmath9 .",
    "these three parameters can be determined using radio maps with arc - second resolution at multiple frequencies , such as those produced with the vla or merlin ( multi - element radio linked interferometer network ) .",
    "multiple - frequency data are needed to use the theory of spectral aging to estimate the lobe propagation velocity ( e.g. , myers & spangler 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , these maps must have the necessary angular resolution and dynamic range to image sufficient portions of the radio bridges .",
    "two published data sets , leahy , muxlow , & stephens ( 1989 ) and liu , pooley , & riley ( 1992 ) , have radio maps of powerful extended radio galaxies at multiple frequencies which are sufficient to compute all three parameters used in determining @xmath6 . these data were used to compute @xmath6 for 14 radio galaxies ( guerra & daly 1996 , 1998 ; guerra 1997 ; daly , guerra , & wan 1998 ) .",
    "current efforts to expand the data set are underway , and include searches through the vla archive .",
    "the vla archive search has already yielded the desired data for six radio galaxies , and new results including these six sources are presented here .",
    "data were selected from observations of powerful extended radio galaxies from the 3cr sample ( bennett 1962 ) on the basis of the observation frequency and array configuration used .",
    "an observation in the vla archive was a candidate if the lobe - lobe angular size of the source was 10 to 40 times the implied beam size , and four hours separated the first and last scans .",
    "these observations should resolve the source sufficiently and have enough @xmath10-coverage to image the bridges . from candidate observations at both l and c band , we have successfully imaged data from six sources .",
    "the vla archive data sets used here are listed in table [ tab : arch ] .",
    "radio imaging was performed using the nrao @xmath11 software package .",
    "the @xmath10 data needed minimal editing , and initial calibration was performed in the standard manner using @xmath11 . as diagnostics ,",
    "initial images were made using the @xmath11 task imagr both without and with the clean deconvolution algorithm .",
    "the final radio maps were produced with the scmap task , which performs self - calibration along with the imagr and clean tasks .",
    "parameters used in @xmath11 for imaging , deconvolution , and calibration are chosen to produce radio maps for a given source that can easily be used for spectral aging analysis .",
    "this is particularly important where observations at different frequencies are produced by different observers .",
    "although some of these radio maps exist , different choices of parameters ( such as the restoring beam ) are often used to produce these radio maps .",
    "thus , reducing the raw @xmath10 data insures that the data analysis can be performed consistently between radio maps .",
    "radio intensity maps produced from vla archive data are presented here ( figures [ fig:2441]-[fig:437 ] ) .",
    "the 4.872 ghz map of 3c 244.1 was created with a restoring beam identical to the synthesized beam of the 1.411 ghz map of 3c 244.1 , and the 4.885 ghz map of 3c 194 was created with a restoring beam identical to the synthesized beam of the 1.465 ghz map of 3c 194 .",
    "thus , radio maps at both frequencies for a particular radio galaxy have similar angular resolutions .",
    "radio maps created with three of these archive data sets have appeared in the literature .",
    "a 1.411 ghz map of 3c 244.1 appeared in leahy & williams ( 1994 ) , and 4.88 ghz maps of 3c 244.1 and 3c 325 appeared in fernini , burns , & perley ( 1997 ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 were performed here in the same manner as wellman , daly , & wan ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "the deconvolved lobe width , @xmath8 , is measured @xmath12 kpc from the hot spot toward the host galaxy .",
    "the lobe magnetic field strength , @xmath9 , is computed from the deconvolved surface brightness and bridge width measured @xmath12 kpc from the hot spot toward the host galaxy .",
    "the lobe propagation velocity , @xmath7 , is computed on the basis of spectral aging along the imaged portions of the bridge , and the magnetic field used in spectral aging is computed using values measured @xmath12 kpc and @xmath13 kpc from the hotspot .",
    "the errors on each of these quantities are discussed in  5 of wdw97b ,  5.2 of wdw97a , and the appendix of this paper .",
    "all parameters presented here are computed with @xmath14 , which means magnetic fields are computed to be 0.25 times the minimum energy values , and without an @xmath15 correction which refers to a correction related to the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift ( see wellman 1997 ; wellman , daly , wan 1997a , b ; guerra 1998 ; guerra & daly 1998 for details ) .",
    "it was found by guerra & daly ( 1998 ) that constraints on cosmological parameters did not depend on these choices , and very similar results are obtained independent of the value of @xmath16 and of whether an @xmath17 correction is applied .",
    "the small dispersion in the average size of 3cr radio galaxies at a given redshift suggests that , at a given redshift , all of the sources have a very similar average size .",
    "this size may be estimated by the average size of the full population of powerful extended radio galaxies at that redshift , @xmath18 , or by the average size of a given source at that redshift , @xmath6 . if the total time a source produces powerful jets , with beam power @xmath19 , that powers the growth and radio emission of the source is @xmath20 , then the average source size will be @xmath21 , assuming the rate of growth of the source , @xmath7 , is roughly constant over the source lifetime .",
    "the source velocity @xmath7 , estimated via synchrotron and inverse compton aging techniques , increases with redshift ( leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ; liu , pooley , & riley 1992 ; daly 1994 , 1995 ; wdw97b ) , and there is no indication that the rate of growth of the sources decreases with redshift .",
    "however , the average size of the full population decreases monotonically with redshift for redshifts greater than about 0.5 ( see table 3 in this paper , and figure 1 in guerra & daly 1998 ) .",
    "this means that , for sources of this type , @xmath20 must decrease with redshift . for the sources studied here , it was shown by wdw97a that the radio power of a given source is roughly constant over the lifetime of that source , making it very unlikely that the radio power of a given source decreases with time , causing sources at higher redshift to fall below the radio flux limit of the survey when they are smaller .",
    "thus , since @xmath18 decreases with redshift for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with @xmath7 either increasing with redshift or independent of redshift , the data require that @xmath20 decrease with redshift .",
    "the rate of growth of the source , @xmath7 , depends on one parameter that is intrinsic to the agn , the beam power @xmath19 , and on two parameters that are extrinsic to the agn , the ambient gas density @xmath24 and the cross sectional area of the radio lobe @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "the total time for which the agn produces a powerful outflow , @xmath20 , must depend on properties intrinsic to the black hole , and the only intrinsic parameter that appears in @xmath7 is @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we write @xmath27 , which defines the one model parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the other intrinsic property of the black hole that might enter is the total energy available to power the outflow , @xmath29 , but since @xmath30 , any dependence on @xmath29 is absorbed into the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "a power law relation between the total time the agn produces powerful jets and the beam power of the jets is not unexpected .",
    "it means that there is a power law relation between the beam power @xmath19 and the total energy available initially @xmath29 ; it is assumed that the beam power is roughly constant over the lifetime of the source , but the value of @xmath19 is set by the initial energy available @xmath29 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the power law relation for main sequence stars between luminosity and lifetime , or between total energy available and luminosity for main sequence stars , and of other power law relations that arise so frequently in astrophysics .",
    "for example , for a value of @xmath28 of 2 , the beam power of the jet is related to the total energy available by the relation @xmath31 , which is similar to the relation between luminosity and mass for main sequence stars : @xmath32 .",
    "note , that for main sequence stars , the luminosity is determined by the total energy available initially , and remains roughly constant over the lifetime of the main sequence star . for a value of @xmath28 of 1.5 ,",
    "the relation between beam power and total energy available is @xmath33 .",
    "the excellent fits obtained by comparing @xmath18 with @xmath6 assuming that @xmath27 supports this choice for the parameterization of @xmath20 . as shown in figure [ fig : lin ] , if the zero - redshift bin containing cygnus a is excluded from the analysis , and the best fit value of @xmath28 and the constant @xmath34 ( defined below ) are determined , we can predict the value of @xmath6 for cygnus a , and it matches the value of @xmath6 for cygnus a to very high accuracy .",
    "this is quite extraordinary if we consider the large drop in @xmath18 that occurs from the first redshift bin to the zero - redshift bin , which is mirrored by the large drop in @xmath6 of cygnus a ( see figures [ fig : dave ] and [ fig : dstar ] ) .",
    "the theory requires that @xmath6 track @xmath18 with redshift , thus it requires @xmath35 where @xmath34 is a constant , independent of redshift .",
    "we do not require that @xmath36 , but we require that this ratio is a constant , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the use of this equation for cosmology is _ independent _ of any factor that might be used to normalize the quantity @xmath6 .",
    "the ratio @xmath37 depends on cosmological parameters and the model parameter @xmath38 the way that this ratio depends on coordinate distance is given by equation ( 6 ) of guerra & daly ( 1998 ) , and the full dependence of @xmath6 on observable parameters is given in appendix a of this paper .",
    "the confidence with which cosmological parameters and the model parameter can be constrained depends on the uncertainty of the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "this is obtained by combining the uncertainty of @xmath18 and the uncertainty of @xmath6 in quadrature .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath18 is given by the dispersion in radio source size at a given redshift .",
    "the errors in @xmath18 range from 10 % to 35 % ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this dominates the uncertainty of the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath6 depends on the uncertainty of each of the quantities used to determine @xmath6 , and is discussed in detail in appendix a of this paper .      in terms of quantities that can be estimated from radio observations , @xmath39 so @xmath40 @xmath41 for perfectly symmetric lobes and bridges .",
    "the three parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 are computed for the bridge on each side of the six radio galaxies obtained from the vla archive , with the exception of one bridge in 3c 324 which was not imaged along its length sufficiently .",
    "the characteristic core - lobe size , @xmath42 , was computed for each bridge using using the equation described above and in guerra & daly ( 1998 ) , and daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) : @xmath43 the characteristic ( lobe - lobe ) size , @xmath6 , is taken to be the sum of both @xmath42 ( or in the case of 3c 324 , @xmath44 ) , and is normalized so that @xmath6 of cygnus a ( 3c 405 ) , a very low redshift source in our sample , is equal to the average size of the full population of powerful classical double radio galaxies at very low redshift ; this does not impact the determination of the model parameter , @xmath28 , or constraints on cosmological parameters , in any way ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters determined using this method are independent of the normalization of @xmath6 , as described in  2.2 . as discussed in  [ ssec : cosmo ] , the best fit value of the one model parameter @xmath28 is determined simultaneously with the best fit values for the two cosmological parameters that enter , @xmath0 and @xmath45 , the normalized values of the current values of the mean mass density and the cosmological constant ( see guerra & daly 1998 ; daly , guerra , & wan 1998 )",
    ".    table [ tab : dstab ] presents the six new @xmath6 values in the last column , assuming the best fit value of @xmath46 ( see  [ ssec : cosmo ] ) . source name and redshift",
    "are listed in the first two columns .",
    "the third column lists the redshift bin corresponding to the assignments in guerra & daly ( 1998 ) and table [ tab : phys ] below .",
    "the lobe - lobe angular size of the source is listed in the fourth column , the fifth and sixth columns list the core - lobe characteristic sizes , @xmath42 , and the characteristic source size is listed in column seven .",
    "the subsample of sources with estimates of the characteristic size , @xmath6 , has been increased from 14 to 20 , as discussed above in  [ sec : samp ] .",
    "only sources with physical sizes , defined as the projected separation between the radio hot spots , greater than @xmath47 kpc can be used to determine a characteristic size .",
    "this is because smaller sources are typically not sufficiently resolved so that the radio data are useful , and the radio lobes of smaller sources are interacting with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy rather than the intergalactic / intracluster medium .",
    "it was decided that this same criterion should be applied to the larger comparison sample of powerful 3cr radio galaxies .",
    "thus , the sample of radio galaxies used to determine the redshift evolution of the physical size has been reduced from 82 to 70 ; twelve radio galaxies were cut because the physical separation between their lobes was less than @xmath47 kpc .",
    "this has a rather small impact on the actual means and standard deviations of the parent population , as can be seen by comparing table [ tab : phys ] of this paper with table 1 of guerra & daly ( 1998 ) .",
    "the average lobe - lobe separations as a function of redshift are listed in table [ tab : phys ] for three example choices of cosmological parameters ( matter - dominated , curvature - dominated , and spatially flat with non - zero cosmological constant ) .    to solve simultaneously for the model parameter @xmath28 and the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath45 , the ratio of @xmath6 for each source to @xmath48 , the average lobe - lobe size of the parent population in the corresponding redshift bin , is fit to a constant , independent of redshift : @xmath49 , where the constant @xmath34 is allowed to float when the best fit parameters are determined .",
    "the value of the constant is a free parameter , so the normalization of @xmath6 does not affect the fits in any way .",
    "figure [ fig : lin ] illustrates the cosmological dependence of @xmath50 on the coordinate distance @xmath51 . as described below , the best fit value of @xmath28 obtained here is @xmath52 ; for this value of @xmath28 , @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath54 is independent of cosmological parameters .",
    "the data can be compared to several different sets of cosmological parameters on a single figure by plotting @xmath54 for each data point and comparing this with @xmath55 curves obtained for different sets of cosmological parameters , as is shown in figure [ fig : lin ] .",
    "note that , for the fits shown , the lowest redshift bin , which includes cygnus a , was excluded from the analysis .",
    "even so , the lines all go directly through this point ( denoted by a star ) indicating the predictive power of this model .",
    "the hypothesis is that , for the correct choice of cosmological parameters , @xmath56 = constant , so that the values of @xmath54 for all 20 radio galaxies should follow a curve that , at each z , tracks the curve @xmath55 obtained for that particular choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : lin ] , shows @xmath57 for the the six new points and 14 original points as a function of z ( the six new points are denoted by open squares ) .",
    "also drawn on this figure are the best - fit curves of @xmath55 obtained for specified values of cosmological parameters and excluding cygnus a from the fits . * in this figure , all of the curves pass through cygnus a , though this is not required when we actually solve for best fitting cosmological parameters . * including cygnus a has a negligible effect on the normalization of these curves and a small effect on cosmological constraints .",
    "it is clear that curves obtained for a low density universe describe the data points quite well , and the curve describing a universe with @xmath58 does not follow the data points .    for all 20 sources , the chi - squared for fitting the ratio to a constant",
    "is computed for relevant values of @xmath28 , @xmath0 , and @xmath45 .",
    "it is found that the best fit value of @xmath28 is @xmath59 .",
    "this result is insensitive to the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath45 , and there appears to be no significant covariance between @xmath28 and cosmological parameters ( see figures [ fig : ombet]a and [ fig : ombet]b ) .",
    "the confidence contours in the @xmath0 - @xmath45 plane are shown in figures [ fig:2d ] and [ fig:1d ] . the probability associated with a given range of @xmath0 and @xmath45 independent of @xmath28",
    "is shown in figure [ fig:2d ] ( referred to as two - dimensional confidence intervals ) . in figure",
    "[ fig:1d ] , the projection of a confidence interval onto either axis ( @xmath0 or @xmath45 ) indicates the probability associated with a given range of that one parameter , independent of all other parameter choices ( referred to as one - dimensional confidence intervals ) .",
    "both figures illustrate how this method and the data are most consistent with a low density universe ; @xmath60 with 68% confidence , @xmath61 with 90% confidence , and @xmath62 with 99% confidence .",
    "the constraints on @xmath45 are not as strong , and values of @xmath45 from zero to unity are consistent with the data .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath59 is consistent with the previous estimates of @xmath63 ( daly 1994 ) , and @xmath64 ( guerra & daly 1996 , 1998 ) , but with significantly reduced uncertainties .",
    "similarly , the constraints on cosmological parameters are consistent with previous estimates , ( daly 1994 ; guerra & daly 1996 , 1998 ; guerra 1997 ; daly , guerra , & wan 1998 ) but with smaller error bars .",
    "it is apparent in figures [ fig:2d ] and [ fig:1d ] that these data and method strongly favor a low density universe ; a universe where @xmath58 is ruled out with 99.0 % confidence independent of @xmath45 and @xmath28 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in  [ sec : disc ] . to further illustrate the insensitivity of cosmological constraints to including cygnus a",
    ", figures [ fig : cyg2d ] and [ fig : cyg1d ] show the confidence intervals when cygnus a is excluded from the fits .",
    "figures [ fig : cyg2d ] and [ fig : cyg1d ] also illustrate that that data are most consistent with a low density universe .",
    "fits excluding cygnus a rule out an @xmath58 universe at 97.5% confidence .",
    "these results are quite similar to those obtained when cygnus a is included .",
    "this further illustrates that the method does not rely upon a low - redshift normalization .",

    "an independent estimate of the mean or characteristic size of a given source was possible for a subset of 20 of these radio galaxies for which extensive multiple frequency radio data was available .",
    "requiring that the two measures of the mean source size have the same redshift behavior allows a simultaneous determination of three parameters : the one model parameter @xmath28 , and the two cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath45 ( assuming that the only significant cosmological parameters today are the mean mass density , a cosmological constant , and space curvature ) .",
