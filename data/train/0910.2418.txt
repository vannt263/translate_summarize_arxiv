    "ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources are point like , nonnuclear sources observed at other galaxies , with observed luminosities greater than the eddington luminosity for a @xmath0 stellar mass black hole ( bh ) , with @xmath1@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the true nature of these objects is still open to debate @xcite .",
    "one fundamental issue is whether the emission is isotropic or beamed along our line - of - sight .",
    "a possible scenario for geometrical beaming involves super - eddington accretion during phases of thermal - timescale mass transfer @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the emission is isotropic and the eddington limit is not violated , ulx must be fuelled by accretion onto intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) , with masses in the range 100 - 10000 @xmath3 @xcite . currently , there is no agreement regarding the nature of these sources .",
    "it is possible that some ulx appear very luminous because of a combination of moderately high mass , mild beaming and mild super - eddington emission .",
    "it is also possible that ulx are an inhomogeneous population , comprised of both a subsample of imbh and moderately beamed stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "ngc  5408 x1 , holm  ii x1 , m 81 x9 ( which is in the companion - dwarf galaxy holmberg ix , hereafter called holm  ix x1 ) , the ulx in ngc  1313 and m 81  x6 are ulx located in dwarf ( ngc  5408 x1 , holm  ii x1 and holm  ix x1 ) and spiral ( ngc  1313 x1 , ngc  1313 x2 and m 81 x6 ) galaxies , respectively .",
    "all these ulx peak in x - ray luminosity above @xmath4@xmath2 , thus being excellent targets for testing spectral models to the data .",
    "they are nearby and located at distances of @xmath5mpc ( @xcite ) , for ngc  5408 x1 , holm  ix x1 , ngc  1313 x1 , m  81 x6 and holm  ii x1 respectively .",
    "ngc  5408 x1 is among the few ulx for which ( 10 - 200mhz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) have been found ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  5408  x-1 exhibits x - ray timing and spectral properties analogous to those exhibited by galactic stellar - mass black hole in the _ very high _ or _ steep power - law _",
    "state @xcite , but with the characteristic variability timescales ( qpo and break frequencies ) consistently scaled down @xcite . for ngc  5408 x1 the inferred characteristic size for the x - ray emitting region is @xmath6 100 times larger than the typical inner disk radii of galactic black holes .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise spectra of ulx can often be fitted by composite models of a thermal disk together with a hard - powerlaw tail , with a low measured disk temperature of @xmath7kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "if such factors are entirely due to a higher black hole mass , they imply an imbh with @xmath8@xmath3 .",
    "both the morphology and flux of the optical high - excitation nebulae detected around some ulx probably rule out strong beaming as the origin of the x - ray emission ( @xcite ) .    the detection for most ulx of spectral curvature , in the form of a deficit of photons at energies @xmath9kev ( @xcite ) has led to the suggestion that most ulx have spectral properties that do not correspond to any of the accretion states known in black hole binaries ( bhb ) , making it unlikely that ulx are powered by sub - eddington flows onto an imbh @xcite .",
    "the application of comptonization models to the data ( @xcite and references therein ) results in strikingly high and low values for the coronal opacity ( @xmath10 ) and the electron temperature ( @xmath11kev ) , difficult to explain for the expected physical conditions in a corona surrounding the black hole .",
    "this is very different to the typical values found for bhb during the _ low / hard _ state , with spectra dominated by comptonization , kev and @xmath10 , have been found in the description of the spectra of bhb during the _ steep powerlaw _ state ( e.g. gro  j165540 and grs  1915 + 105 ; @xcite ) . ] and appears irreconcilable with the imbh model , which assumes that they operate as simple scaled - up bhb .    here",
    ", we present an alternative interpretation of the spectral shape , based on a physically - justified model commonly used on other accreting black holes .",
    "the soft part of the spectrum ( @xmath12kev )  the soft x - ray excess  and the high - energy curvature are just aspects of a reflection spectrum expected from accretion ( @xcite ) . a major component of reflection , the broad iron k line , has been found in many seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) , accreting stellar - mass black holes ( @xcite ) and even accreting neutron stars ( @xcite ) . both the soft excess and the relativistic broad iron k line have recently been demonstrated to be part of the same physical process , i.e. , the reaction of the disk to irradiation from a high - energy source , in the seyfert-1 galaxy 1h 0707 - 495 @xcite . in this paper we investigate whether reflection models can account for the spectra of these ulx and , if so , we put them in the context of the accreting black holes known so far .    for this study , we choose the ulx with the best available data and with the longest exposure time observations ( @xmath13ks of exposure time ) of the _ xmm - newton _ satellite . by using only the highest quality data from the widest band pass , highest sensitivity instruments available",
    "we expect to make good statements on the accretion processes in these ulx . in section [ observ ]",
    "we describe the observations and data used , in section [ spec_anal ] we report on the results of the application of fits with the reflection model to the spectra and in section [ discuss ] discuss the results obtained .",
    "in this work , we consider the time averaged _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn spectra from the longest available observations of sources with a rate @xmath14counts / s in the x - ray band .",
    "the datasets were obtained through the _ xmm - newton _ public data archive .",
    "the epic - pn camera has a higher effective area than the epic - mos cameras , and drives the results of any joint spectral analysis . the reduction and analysis reported in this work used sas version 8.0.0 .",
    "we checked for pile - up in all the observations and found that this was not significant ( i.e. less than 5 per cent for the high energy channels ) for all the observations .    in table",
    "[ log_obs ] we present a log of the observations .",
    "we applied the standard time and flare filtering ( rejecting high - background periods of rate @xmath15counts / s , as recommended for the pn camera ) .",
    "we filtered the event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath16 for the pn ) , and rejecting flagged events ( flag@xmath17 ) .",
    "for each exposure , we extracted the flux from a circular region on each source .",
    "the background was extracted from a circular region , not far from the sources .",
    "both the coordinates of the centroids and the radius used for the regions were the same as those employed by @xcite .",
    "we built response functions with the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "we fitted the background - subtracted spectra with standard models in xspec 12.5.0 @xcite .",
    "all errors quoted in this work are @xmath18 confidence errors , obtained by allowing all variable parameters to float during the error scan .",
    "owing to the uncertainties in the epic calibration , we used only the 0.310kev range .",
    "the resulting spectra were grouped with the ftool grppha to bins with a minimum of 20 counts each .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "remarkably , a relativistically - blurred , reflection - dominated model gives a very good fit to the sample of ulx with best quality ( 100ks of time exposure ) _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "very skewed iron line profiles have been found , implying that the emission region is very close to the black - hole and this fact allowed us to determine their spin .",
    "we find that all the ulx in our sample are close to maximally rotating , with the exception of ngc  5408 x1 and holm  ii x1 , for which the steep powerlaw did not allow us to properly determine parameters from the fe line .",
    "we have found that , the sources showing a _ reflection dominated _ spectrum ( ngc  1313 x1 , ngc  1313 x2 and m  81 x6 ) have maximally spinning black - holes .",
    "this fact can be understood if light bending is an important effect for these sources . for these sources ,",
    "the high - energy source ( i.e. the jet or corona ) is very close to the black hole and the observed direct continuum ( i.e. powerlaw ) is very low .",
    "this would correspond to regime i of @xcite , corresponding to a low height of the primary source , where strong light suffered by the primary radiation dramatically reduces the observed powerlaw emission component at infinity .",
    "holm  ix x1 shows a _ powerlaw dominated _ spectrum with a slightly narrower fe line profile .",
    "this would correspond to regime ii of @xcite , when the height of the primary source is larger , and the observed direct continuum ( i.e. powerlaw ) stronger .",
    "the line profile is narrower than in regime i because the emissivity profile of the disk is flatter , as result of a nearly isotropic illumination . for ngc  5408 x1 and holm  ii x1",
    ", we find a clear reflection component but the steepness of the spectra means that the fe k features are less well - measured .",
    "the spectral solution we have found here for ulx suggests a new explanation for accretion onto spinning black holes .",
    "our model assumes that the dominant source of radiation is a power - law continuum produced a few gravitational radii above a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "little thermal radiation is produced by the disc and is undetected by the current data .",
    "we assume that the power for this source is extracted magnetically from the disc and transferred to the emission region by magnetic fields .",
    "some of the power may even be extracted magnetically from the spin of the black hole @xcite . since radiation is only produced above the disc , radiation pressure need not oppose accretion .",
    "indeed it will help squash the disc and maintain the high surface density required for our relatively low ionization parameters and thus observable reflection .",
    "( note that strong light bending occurs in the region being considered which is very close to a black hole , meaning that there is beaming but in the _ _",
    "o__pposite sense to that normally envisaged . )",
    "the relevant radiation for computing the physical eddington limit in this situation is the thermal disc radiation , not the power - law continuum and reflection associated with it .",
    "since we detect no such thermal radiation , then the situation may be sub - eddington , even for stellar mass black holes .",
    "whether this solution can work depends on the extent to which magnetic energy extraction can be clean , in the sense of not requiring considerable thermal energy release .",
    "we note that the accretion flow is super - eddington in the conventional interpretation in which the total energy release is considered ( especially since some radiation falls straight into the black hole )",
    ".    if the above solution is appropriate for these objects then they can either be stellar mass black holes with masses of @xmath19 or imbh of @xmath20s@xmath21 .",
    "their spin is then likely to be natal .",
    "if they form through stellar collapse and the progenitor star was highly spinning , then it would be likely that the black hole would remain highly spinning .",
    "many studies have argued that a binary companion can spin up a massive star but the magnitude of the spin up is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accretion would presumably come from a binary companion .",
    "an interesting alternative is that they accrete from a debris disc produced by fallback from the ( failed ) supernova or collapsar @xcite .",
    "this could account for the high metallicity we infer ( note that hydrogen - poor accretion would also slightly raise the eddington limit ) .    in summary",
    ", some ulx may consist of fast spinning black holes accreting rapidly from a metal - rich disc .",
    "accretion power passes magnetically to the primary emission region which lies just outside the accretion flow .",
    "strong reflection occurs , creating a soft excess and very broad iron - k features in the 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray spectrum .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray spectra in the 1050  kev band may test this scenario .",
    "this work is based on observations made with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
