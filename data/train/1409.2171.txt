    "kagome lattice spin systems have been a topic of intense research for quite some time .",
    "it is believed that the high level of frustration in these systems can give rise to exotic spin liquid phases .",
    "a good model to look for these phases is the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice . in the past , many theoretical and numerical methods have been used to study such frustrated spin systems .",
    "more recently , with the discovery of materials like volborthite and herbertsmithite there is the possibility of realizing some of these phases in actual experiments .",
    "the ground state of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice is considered to be a promising candidate for realizing spin liquid phases .",
    "however , so far the many theoretical and numerical studies still remain inconclusive .",
    "recent numerical and theoretical studies strongly agree in favor of a gapped @xmath7 spin liquid state.@xcite .",
    "other studies argue instead in favor of a gapless @xmath8-dirac spin liquid state.@xcite a few other studies also indicate the possibility of a valence - bond ( vbc ) type of crystalline state,@xcite while some other studies find symmetry breaking states @xcite or even a chiral spin liquid state.@xcite further , recent experiments on herbertsmithite do indicate that its ground state may indeed be a quantum spin liquid.@xcite    in the presence of an external magnetic field , frustrated quantum antiferromagnets are expected to give rise to magnetization plateaus of which the plateau at @xmath9 should be most prominent and , for this reason , there has been a lot of work analyzing the properties of these plateaus . numerical works focusing on the isotropic and ising regimes of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field do identify magnetization plateaus at many different values .",
    "however , in the ising regime , the simulations favor a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) type state with an enlarged unit cell based on a @xmath10 structure at these plateaus.@xcite    experimentally it is difficult to observe these magnetization plateaus in herbertsmithite ( the most structurally perfect kagome compound ) since its exchange coupling is quite high , @xmath11 , which implies that it would require fields close to 200 t to be able to observe the @xmath1 plateau . as a result okamoto _",
    "looked at volborthite ( with @xmath12 ) and vesignieite ( with @xmath13 ) and found a plateau at @xmath14 which is a little off from the expected value at @xmath9.@xcite another study did observe the @xmath9 plateau in another kagome compound ( cu - titmb ) .",
    "however , the plateau is unstable in cu - titmb and the nearest neighbor interactions and next nearest neighbor interactions are comparable in this material,@xcite complicating the physics of the plateaus .",
    "common approaches used to study frustrated spin systems involve either representing the spin operators in terms of slave fermions@xcite or in terms of slave bosons.@xcite these methods have been used extensively in theoretical and numerical works .",
    "both these approaches work well at the mean - field level but suffer from the limitation that there is no small parameter about which the fluctuations can be treated in a consistent manner .",
    "controlled calculations have been performed by generalizing the @xmath15 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic model to an @xmath16 or @xmath17 spin model on the kagome lattice@xcite but it is not clear if the results obtained in the large-@xmath18 limit remain valid for the experimentally relevant case of @xmath19 .    here , we present an alternative approach based on a lattice chern - simons theory on a kagome lattice which implements a two - dimensional jordan - wigner transformation that maps hard - core bosons ( flipped spins of the antiferromagnet ) onto spinless fermions coupled to the chern - simons gauge fields.@xcite lattice chern - simons theories were defined for a system on a square lattice,@xcite and within a consistent lattice chern - simons approach , they were used to study the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice.@xcite    chern - simons theories have been very successful in studying and explaining fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) type states .",
    "these theories yield reliable results in gapped systems and thus may present some new insight into the problem of frustrated quantum systems . for these reasons",
    "they have been used for quite some time to study quantum antiferromagnets on frustrated lattices ( triangular , kagome , shastry - sutherland , and others ) yielding of intriguing results of possible spin liquid phases.@xcite in these works these systems were treated only at the level of the average field approximation , and the role of the quantum fluctuations of the chern - simons gauge field were ignored .",
    "these fluctuations are crucial to the physics of this systems .",
    "this is a well known issue from the analogous theories of the fqh fluids where these fluctuations they play a key role in the physics of the excitations , and in particular their fractional statistics ( for a detailed recent discussion of this problem in the fqh fluids see ref .",
    "however the existing lattice chern - simons theory@xcite ( and its more refined and consistent version by eliezer and semenoff@xcite ) can only be used for systems on a square lattice and , in particular , it can not be used for frustrated systems on non - bipartite lattices .",
    "the chern - simons action encodes two key features : 1 ) the local constraint requiring the states to be locally gauge invariant ( in the form of a gauss - type law ) and 2 ) a definition of the canonical pairs of fields . the first condition , which for a chern - simons theory is a relation between the charge on a site and the gauge flux in an adjacent `` plaquette '' ,",
    "must be obeyed at all sites of the lattice and not just on average .",
    "this condition requires that the gauge fluxes on different `` plaquettes '' must commute with each other since otherwise the constraints do not commute with each other ( even through while they may still commute locally with the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this consistency condition sets a restriction on the commutation relations of the gauge fields .",
    "eliezer and semenoff@xcite showed how to impose these conditions consistently for the case of square lattice , at the expense of making the chern - simons action less local than would have naively expected.@xcite it is easy to see that these constraints , even in a non - bipartite lattice , can only be imposed consistently provided that there is a one - to - one correspondence between sites and `` plaquettes '' of the lattice . in this paper",
    "we will show that this can be done for the ( non - bipartite ) kagome lattice . in a separate publication",
    "we discuss the generalizations of this construction to more complex lattices .",
    "however , this approach does not work for the triangular lattice , for which there are two different adjacent triangles ( `` plaquettes '' ) for each site of the lattice .",
    "similarly , this procedure does not work for the ( bipartite ) hexagonal lattice for which two sites are associated with each hexagon .",
    "in this paper we study the nearest - neighbor @xmath20 frustrated quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice using a generalization of the construction of the chern - simons gauge theory of eliezer and semenoff to the non - bipartite kagome lattice which we present here .",
    "this construction is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "the generalization of this construction for a class of frustrated 2d lattices is presented elsewhere.@xcite in this picture the flipped - spins are represented by hard - core bosons which in turn are described as a problem of fermions coupled to a chern - simons gauge field on the same lattice .",
    "further , the effect of an external magnetic field can also be easily mimicked by adjusting the density of fermions in the equivalent problem .",
    "more importantly , this approach will also allow us to go beyond mean - field theory and analyze the effect of fluctuations in such systems .",
    "it is here that the effects of the consistent constriction are crucial . here",
    "we will focus on the simpler case of the 1/3 magnetization plateau .    within our approximations",
    "we find that , in the @xmath2 limit and for a wide range of the anisotropy parameter @xmath21 , the ground state of the 1/3 magnetization plateau of the @xmath20 model on the kagome lattice is equivalent to a laughlin fractional quantum hall state of hard - core bosons with filling fraction @xmath4 .",
    "this fully gapped state is a topological fluid with a broken time reversal invariance .",
    "this is a state with spin currents in the ground state and with a fractional hall spin conductance , has a two - fold ground state degeneracy on the torus , has a single chiral gapless edge state on a disk geometry , and that the excitations of this state are semions .",
    "we also found two other plateaus states , one at magnetization @xmath6 ( which is equivalent to the @xmath3 plateau ) and another one at @xmath5 .",
    "the plateau at @xmath5 magnetization is also a topological fluid and is equivalent to the first jain daughter state of the laughlin fqh state for bosons at filling fraction @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the state has two chiral edge states , has a three - fold ground state degeneracy on the torus and the excitations are anyons with statistical angle @xmath22 .",
    "we also showed that , as expected , the spin - spin correlation functions decay exponentially as a function of distance while exhibiting an oscillatory behavior which reflects the breaking of time - reversal symmetry . for large enough anisotropy we find a quantum phase transition to time - reversal invariant states which extend all the way to the ising limit , where it has been shown@xcite that the ground state is governed by a quantum order - by - disorder mechanism and that it equivalent to a complex valence - bond solid . a possible time - reversal invariant @xmath7 spin liquid has been conjectured to exist at intermediate values of the anisotropy .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : jordan - wigner_transformation ] , the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is introduced and the jordan - wigner transformation is summarized along with the difficulties related to defining a chern - simons term on a lattice . the procedure to obtain a consistent chern - simons theory on the kagome lattice is described in subsection [ sec : cs_kagome ] .",
    "a more detailed discussion on the lattice chern - simons theory and when such a procedure works will be presented elsewhere.@xcite t in section [ sec : mft ] , we analyze the consequences of this theory at the mean - field level and set up the saddle - point equations for the nearest - neighbor @xmath20 model after performing the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the mean field theory of the magnetization plateaus is presented in section [ sec : mft ] .",
    "subsection  [ sec : xy - mft ] deals with the simpler case of the @xmath2 regime and the possible magnetization plateaus that can arise are discussed at the mean - field level where this problem reduces to a problem of interacting fermions hopping on a kagome lattice in the presence of a background statistical gauge field .",
    "this mean field state closely resembles integer quantum hall type states , typical of the composite fermion approach to the fqh states . in subsection",
    "[ sec : xxz - mft ] we discuss the @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 plateaus , and analyze the full @xmath20 heisenberg antiferromagnetic model at these fillings .",
    "the effect of fluctuations on the @xmath1 and @xmath24 plateau states are considered in section  [ sec : effects_of_fluctuations ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of the fluctuations and how they alter the mean - field physics .",
    "the states now correspond to a _",
    "fractional _ quantum hall type state for bosons with fractional ( spin ) hall conductivity of @xmath25 and @xmath23 respectively and are thus identified with the laughlin fqh state for bosons at @xmath26 and the first jain state ( for bosons ) at @xmath27 .",
    "lastly , we also present asymptotic calculations of the spin correlations in the magnetization plateaus based on the effective continuum theory ion section [ sec : spin - correlations ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to our conclusions and some open problems .",
    "details of the calculations are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we discuss our results and open questions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the jordan - wigner transformation that maps heisenberg spins to fermions coupled to a chern - simons gauge field .",
    "this transformation was first discussed in ref .",
    "an important property of the chern - simons gauge field is that it imposes a constraint that relates the local density of the fermions to the flux through an adjacent plaquette of the lattice .",
    "this flux attachment allows us to identify the spins ( which are hard - core bosons ) with fermions carrying half a flux quantum . as a result of this constraint , it is crucial to be able to define the chern - simons term in a consistent manner on the lattice so that the flux attachment may be performed at each and every site on the lattice .",
    "the model that we will study is the nearest - neighbor @xmath20 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath28 @xmath29 - h \\sum_i s^z_i      \\label{eq : heisenberg}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 for antiferromagnetic interactions , @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) are the three spin-1/2 operators at lattice site @xmath33 , @xmath34 stands for nearest neighboring sites , and @xmath21 is the magnetic anisotropy parameter along the @xmath35-direction .",
    "after the jordan - wigner transformation , the resultant action with fermions and the chern - simons gauge field becomes @xmath36 where the fermionic and interacting parts are @xmath37               \\label{eq : lagrangian - free}\\\\          s_{\\rm int}(\\psi , \\psi^ * ) = & \\lambda j \\int_t \\sum_{<x , x'>}\\left(\\frac{1}{2 } - n(x , t ) \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } - n(x',t ) \\right )      \\label{eq : lagrangian_fermions }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the covariant time derivative , @xmath39 is the fermion density operator ( i.e. the site occupancy ) , and @xmath40 stands for nearest neighboring sites @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the kagome lattice . under the transformation",
    "the @xmath35 component of the spin operator , @xmath43 , is mapped to the local fermion occupation number @xmath44 we can then absorb the external magnetic field term in the hamiltonian , @xmath45 , in the definition of the chemical potential @xmath46 in eq .. hence , the effect of the external magnetic field can easily be mimicked by adjusting the fermionic filling .    in the jordan - wigner transformation",
    "the parameter @xmath47 is selected so that the statistics of the spins ( which are hard - core bosons ) are changed in to fermions",
    ". this can be done by choosing @xmath48 for any @xmath49 .",
    "although the hard - core boson to fermion mapping holds for all integer ( positive and negative ) values of @xmath50 , we will see below that for two special values , @xmath51 ( or , equivalently , @xmath52 ) , there is a mean field approximation with a fully gapped spectrum .",
    "the resulting states for these two choices of @xmath47 are related to each other by time reversal and hence by a reversal of the sign of the magnetization .    in order to complete the jordan - wigner transformation ,",

    "this lattice chern - simons theory was subsequently used to successfully study the ( unfrustrated ) spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice.@xcite    by generalizing the procedure outlined by eliezer and semenoff , we were able to develop a chern - simons theory that can be consistently defined on the non - bipartite kagome lattice .",
    "this will now allow us to use the jordan - wigner mapping to study the nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice .",
    "the next section will briefly outline this procedure .",
    "a construction of the lattice chern - simons term for more general non - bipartite lattices is presented elsewhere.@xcite      we begin by writing down the below generic form for the lattice chern - simons term @xmath55 where the @xmath56 fields are defined on the sites of the lattice and the @xmath57 fields are defined on the links of the lattice .",
    "see fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] for our definitions of these gauge fields on the unit cell of the kagome lattice .",
    "note that in eq . we have omitted the factor of @xmath47 .    the first term in eq .",
    "is the gauss law term that imposes the constraint between local density and flux through the plaquettes of the kagome lattice .",
    "the vector kernel @xmath58 enforces the condition that relates the charge ( i.e. the site occupancy by a fermions ) to the gauge flux in the adjacent plaquette . once a gauss law has been fixed , the first term in eq .",

    "a key feature of the kagome lattice ( shared with the square lattice ) is that there is a one - to - one correspondence between sites of the lattice and plaquettes of the same lattice .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in other planar lattices , e.g. honeycomb and triangular , which leads to flux attachment prescriptions which are ambiguous and break the symmetries of the lattice .",
    "we elaborate more on this issue in ref . [ ] .",
    "the structure of the matrix kernel , denoted by @xmath59 in the second term in eq . , determines the commutation relations between the different ( spatial ) gauge fields as follows @xmath60 = - i k_{ij}^{-1}(x - y ) \\label{eq : acommutation}\\ ] ] it is the structure of the matrix kernel @xmath59 in the second term of eq . that will allow us to consistently impose the gauss law constraints on the lattice .",

    "the last condition is primarily included to obtain the simplest form of the lattice chern - simons term .",
    "now , we will proceed by establishing these conditions on the kagome lattice and obtaining the chern - simons term .",
    "we should note that the matrix @xmath65 of eq .",
    "is unrelated to the so - called @xmath61-matrix that appears in the classification of abelian fqh states.@xcite          the first step in writing down the chern - simons term is to determine how to impose the gauss law ( flux attachment ) on the kagome lattice .",
    "the unit cell of the kagome lattice has three inequivalent sites ( denoted by @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] ) and three plaquettes ( two triangles , denoted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 in fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] , and one hexagon , denoted by @xmath66 in fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] ) .",
    "thus , there is a natural correspondence between sites and plaquettes ( just as in the case of a square lattice ) .",
    "it turns out that this is the crucial condition that needs to be satisfied in order to write down a chern - simons lattice term on a generic lattice.@xcite    on the kagome lattice , whose unit cell is shown in fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] , we define the flux through each plaquette ( defined by the associated sites @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) to be @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are vectors along the two directions of the lattice as shown in fig.[fig : kagome_unit_cell ] .",
    "these equations attach the flux at sub - lattice @xmath66 to that of the hexagon ( @xmath72 ) and the fluxes of sub - lattices @xmath67 and @xmath68 to each of the two corresponding triangles ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively ) .",
    "the second step in writing down the chern - simons term is to demand that eq .",
    "is gauge invariant under the gauge transformations @xmath75 for time component of the gauge fields and @xmath76 for the space components of the gauge fields ( where @xmath77 is the difference operator on the kagome lattice ) . as an example , the field @xmath78 gets transformed as @xmath79 under a gauge transformation where the labels @xmath67 and @xmath66 again refer to the sub - lattices and the field @xmath80 lives on the sites of the lattice .",

    "the matrix @xmath61 is invertible .    the above form of the matrix @xmath61 in eq .",

    "this will allow us to impose the gauss law constraint consistently on each and every site of the kagome lattice .",
    "more precisely , any two wilson loops on the lattice commute , and wilson lines on the lattice obey a signed intersection rule analogous to what happens in the continuum case of a chern - simons theory .",
    "this completes the mapping of eq . for the nearest - neighbor @xmath20 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice into a system of fermions coupled to chern - simons gauge fields .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the construction of the chern - simons theory on other non - bipartite lattices will be presented in another publication.@xcite here , we continue by looking at the consequences of this theory on the kagome lattice .      in the preceding subsections we showed that a system of hard - core bosons on a kagome lattice , representing the flipped spins of the spin-1/2 anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice ( relative to the uniformly magnetized reference state ) , is equivalent to a system of fermions on the same kagome lattice minimally coupled to a chern - simons gauge field ( defined on the links of the kagome lattice ) .",
    "the same result was obtained earlier on for the case of the square lattice.@xcite    a consequence of this mapping ( actually , an identity ) is the operator identification @xmath93 which follows from the local ( gauss law ) constraint of the chern - simons theory , discussed in subsection [ sec : gauss ] , which relates the _ local _ fermion occupation number of lattice site @xmath94 to the flux @xmath95 on the adjoining plaquette .",
    "a second consequence is the following formal identification of the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath96 in terms of fermion operators coupled to wilson lines of the gauge field @xmath97 where the sum in the exponent has to be interpreted as the oriented sum of gauge fields defined on the links of the lattice on an ( arbitrary ) open path @xmath98 ending at the site @xmath94 .",
