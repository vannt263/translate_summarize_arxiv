    "on one hand , a magnetic field parallel to the plane of the 2d gas lifts the spin degeneracy and allows for a measurement that distinguishes between the transport properties of up  and down  spins : as long as the confining potential that determines the 2d electron gas is sharp , it does not significantly affect the electron s orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "conventionally , the main signature of spin - orbit coupling in the 2d electron gas in gaas heterostructures is the observation of weak anti - localization , a small positive quantum correction to the conductivity that is suppressed by a magnetic field.@xcite weak anti - localization is the counterpart of weak localization , a negative correction to the conductivity at zero magnetic field caused by the constructive interference of back - scattered electron waves in a phase - coherent disordered conductor in the absence of spin - orbit scattering.@xcite only recently , spin - dependent phase coherent transport was considered for a quantum dot , a small island of the electron gas confined by gates @xcite .",

    "not only does the crossover regime between weak localization and anti - localization represent an interesting issue of its own , understanding features imposed upon quantum transport by spin - orbit coupling is needed for a correct extraction of the decoherence time from experimental data . for electrons in a small dot with weak but finite spin - orbit coupling , the the crossover of weak localization to anti - localization manifests itself as a suppression of the zero - temperature value of localization correction to the dot conductance .",
    "this suppression of the weak localization correction may be misinterpreted as a saturation of the decoherence time @xmath0 at low temperatures . without a priori knowledge of the spin - orbit coupling constants for a given semiconductor dot",
    ", one must use the features of spin - orbit coupling induced interference effects in order to identify the origin of what can be mistaken for a suppression of the interference part of conductance , when the observed weak localization correction is less than the prediction of the quantum transport theory for to the crossover between orthogonal and unitary symmetry classes .    in this publication ,",
