    "the search for compact - body solutions of general relativity began in 1915 .",
    "a century on , our perspective is that neutron stars and black holes are abundant in our universe , and that the supernovae which create them are vital in seeding galaxies with heavy elements .",
    "compact - body solutions divide into two classes : ( 1 ) _ black holes _ , causally - nontrivial geometries with spacetime horizons ; and ( 2 ) _ solitons _ , regular geometries sourced by matter fields . broadly interpreted ,",
    "the latter class comprises white dwarfs and neutron stars , as well as exotic hypothetical possibilities , such as quark , preon , electroweak or boson stars @xcite .",
    "solitons can become black holes in gravitational collapse ( cf .",
    "the chandrasekhar and tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff mass limits ) .",
    "but are there other possibilities ?    in certain scenarios , black holes may support `` hair '' , in the form of non - trivial matter fields ( for a recent review , see e.g.  ref .",
    "a hairy black hole may be thought of as a hybrid : a nonlinear superposition of a vacuum black hole and a soliton @xcite , or , `` horizons inside lumps '' @xcite . like a soliton",
    ", a hairy black hole possesses externally - accessible degrees of freedom , yet like a vacuum black hole , it divides spacetime into causally - distinct regions .",
    "many matter models that admit solitonic solutions also admit hairy black hole solutions . in this paper , we seek soliton solutions to accompany the hairy black hole solutions we identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of einstein charged scalar field theory @xcite in a cavity .    in @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory in four - dimensional ,",
    "asymptotically flat spacetime , the discovery of solitons @xcite was followed closely by the discovery of hairy black hole solutions @xcite . however , both the solitons and hairy black holes were soon found to be unstable @xcite . under perturbation , the black holes lose their gauge - field hair and evolve towards a ( stable ) vacuum black hole solution ; the solitons either collapse to form a vacuum black hole or else the gauge field is radiated away to infinity , leaving pure minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "this prompts an intriguing question : are there scenarios in which the converse occurs , i.e. , in which a vacuum black hole spontaneously evolves towards a hairy configuration which is stable ?",
    "it has long been known that , in a penrose process @xcite , a vacuum black hole may shed energy and angular momentum ( and/or charge ) whilst also increasing its horizon area .",
    "one such penrose process is superradiance @xcite . in the kerr black hole context",
    ", superradiance implies that the low - frequency corotating modes of a bosonic field are scattered with a reflection coefficient of greater than unity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if superradiant modes are trapped in the vicinity of the black hole they suffer repeated amplification , causing exponential growth in the field : a `` black hole bomb '' instability @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms for confinement of superradiant modes have been explored , such as a mirror @xcite , a field mass @xcite , or a spacetime boundary @xcite .",
    "what is the outcome of a black hole bomb instability , in the case of a massive bosonic field bound to a kerr black hole ?",
    "one possibility is that the black hole ejects the field in an explosive `` bosenova '' outflow @xcite , to return to a near - vacuum configuration .",
    "a second possibility is that the black hole evolves towards a hairy configuration which is stable .",
    "the latter possibility has been given credence by the recent discovery of an asymptotically - flat family of kerr - like black holes possessing ( complex , massive ) scalar - field hair @xcite , and a single ( helical ) killing vector @xcite .",
    "this one - parameter family of solutions to the einstein - klein - gordon equations bifurcates from the kerr solution @xcite , and furthermore reduces to `` solitonic '' boson star solutions in a well - defined limit .",
    "an important open question is whether such solutions are stable under perturbation .",
    "the timescale for the growth of a massive scalar field instability on kerr is rather long ( @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it challenging to track the development of the instability from a weak perturbation into the nonlinear regime using a time - domain evolution ( though see @xcite and @xcite for scalar and proca field evolutions , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that there is a _ charged _ version of superradiance @xcite , whereby low - frequency modes of a charged scalar field incident on a spherically - symmetric reissner - nordstrm black hole are scattered with a reflection coefficient of greater than unity . although superradiant bound modes do not form naturally for a charged massive field , due to the electrostatic repulsion that out - competes the gravitational attraction in the superradiant regime , the charged black hole bomb can nevertheless be triggered with two mechanisms : either by placing the charged black hole in a cavity ( i.e.  confining the bosonic field within a reflecting mirror ) @xcite ; or by embedding the charged black hole within an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime @xcite .",
    "these systems are more tractable for nonlinear studies than the superradiant instability on kerr , not only because of the simplification afforded by spherical symmetry , but also because the timescales for the development of the charged black hole bomb instability are typically shorter than those in the kerr case .",
    "two recent studies of the nonlinear development have shed new light on the ultimate fate of the charged black hole bomb instability . in the cavity scenario , sanchis - gual _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite evolved the einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equations in the spherically - symmetric sector , and demonstrated that a reissner - nordstrm black hole in electrovacuum , after weak perturbation , can develop into a hairy configuration @xcite in which some , but not all , of the charge has transferred from the black hole into the scalar field . for low field charge , the approach to the final state is smooth , whereas for high charge an overshoot triggers an explosive bosenova phenomenon .    in the ads scenario in four dimensions , bosch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated a compatible result : a reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole , under generic perturbation by a charged scalar field , will develop into a stable hairy configuration , by transferring mass and charge into the surrounding field .    previously , in ref .",
    "@xcite we constructed hairy black hole solutions for einstein charged scalar field theory @xcite in a cavity . by applying a first - order perturbation analysis , we argued that the configuration without zeros in the scalar field between the horizon and mirror would be stable ; and that higher overtones with nodes would be unstable .",
    "this result was then borne out by the dynamical investigation of sanchis - gual _ et al . _",

    "[ fig : twelve ] we see that the solitons with smaller values of @xmath52 and @xmath51 are stable and have @xmath194 , while @xmath196 and the solutions become unstable for large @xmath52 and @xmath51 on the @xmath104 contour . as we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nine ] , the two parts of the @xmath104 contour correspond to two branches of solutions , one ( the `` low charge '' branch ) having smaller soliton electric charge @xmath57 and the other ( the `` high charge '' branch ) having larger values of @xmath57 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : twelve ] and [ fig : thirteen ] we find both stable and unstable solitons on both branches . from fig .",
    "[ fig : thirteen ] , on the `` low charge '' branch , solitons with smaller values of @xmath57 are stable while those with larger @xmath57 are unstable .",
    "in contrast , for the `` high charge '' branch , it is those solitons with smaller values of @xmath57 which are unstable while those with large @xmath57 are stable .",
    "we investigated other constant @xmath83 contours and found similar behaviour .",
    "in this paper we have presented new regular soliton solutions of the einstein - charged scalar field equations in a cavity .",
    "the static , spherically symmetric solutions are regular everywhere inside and on a reflecting boundary at @xmath55 , on which the scalar field vanishes . as with the corresponding black hole solutions @xcite , these solitons do not exist in asymptotically flat spacetime in the absence of the mirror - like boundary .",
    "the mirror is placed at the zero of the equilibrium scalar field nearest the regular origin .",
    "the static field equations possess a scaling symmetry which means that we can fix the scalar field charge @xmath16 without loss of generality .",
    "the system then has a single length scale , set by the radius of the mirror @xmath83 .",
    "this is in contrast to the black hole case , where there are two length scales : the radius of the mirror @xmath83 and the radius of the event horizon @xmath210 .",
    "the phase space of soliton solutions is therefore simpler than the black hole phase space described in @xcite . with the scalar field charge @xmath16 fixed",
    ", the soliton solutions are parameterized by two quantities : the value of the scalar field at the origin @xmath51 , and the electromagnetic potential at the origin , @xmath52 .    in the black hole case , there is an upper bound on the corresponding phase space parameter describing the electromagnetic field , which arises from the requirement of a regular event horizon . in the soliton case",
    ", there are no _ a priori _ constraints on the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath51 . for each value of @xmath52",
    ", we find regular soliton solutions in a finite range of values of @xmath51 .",
    "however , we have not been able to find an upper bound on the value of @xmath52 for which there are nontrivial soliton solutions .",
    "when @xmath52 is very large , the size of the interval in @xmath51 for which there are soliton solutions increases and the mirror radius can be extremely small .",
    "we then examined the stability of the above soliton solutions under linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations of the metric , electromagnetic potential and scalar field , considering time - periodic perturbations with frequency @xmath195 .",
    "all the solutions we examined with sufficiently large mirror radius @xmath83 are such that the lowest value of @xmath168 found is positive ( and hence the frequency @xmath195 is real ) .",
    "therefore the solitons appear to be stable if the mirror radius is large .",
    "however , for sufficiently small values of the mirror radius @xmath83 , corresponding to sufficiently large values of @xmath52 and @xmath51 , we find that for some ( but not all ) solitons the lowest value of @xmath168 is negative , so that the frequency @xmath195 is imaginary and the solitons are unstable .",
    "although the stability of the solitons depends in a complicated way on the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath51 , we may understand our results heuristically by considering a fixed , but large , @xmath51 .",
    "as the parameter @xmath52 increases , the electric field strength also increases , as does the matter energy density at the origin .",
    "it seems to be the case that if @xmath52 , and hence the matter energy density at the origin , gets too large , then the soliton becomes unstable .",
    "are there scalar solitons in analogous situations which share the qualitative stability features we find here ?",
    "our spacetime has a time - like boundary , the reflecting mirror , and a natural analogue would be charged - scalar solitons in ads where the boundary of the spacetime is time - like .",
    "the phase space of charged - scalar solitons in four - dimensional ads is extremely rich @xcite ( see @xcite for a similarly comprehensive study of charged - scalar solitons in ads@xmath211 ) .",
    "the work in @xcite considers in depth the @xmath212-phase space of solutions , where @xmath117 is the mass of the asymptotically ads solitons .",
    "it is therefore difficult to draw analogies with our cavity system since we are unable to consistently define a mass for our soliton solutions .    instead",
    ", we consider a more helpful analogy to be boson stars , that is , solitons in models involving a time - dependent complex scalar field with a self - interaction potential but no electromagnetic field ( see , for example , @xcite for a review of boson stars in asymptotically flat spacetime ) . in",
    "asymptotically flat spacetime , ground - state boson stars have a scalar field profile which has no zeros . for these boson stars ,",
    "if the central density is larger than a particular critical value they are unstable ; if the central density is smaller than the critical value the boson stars are stable @xcite .",
    "similar behaviour is observed for charged boson stars in asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite and also for boson stars in asymptotically ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear analysis @xcite reveals that an unstable ground - state boson star in asymptotically flat spacetime may collapse to form a black hole or scalar radiation may escape to infinity , with a stable boson star as the end - point configuration .",
    "it is also possible for an unstable boson star to dissipate completely , so that ultimately the spacetime is pure minkowski .",
    "what then might be the end - point of the instability we have found for some charged - scalar solitons inside a small cavity ?",
    "one possibility is that the configuration settles into an alternative ( stable ) charged - scalar soliton , although the presence of the mirror makes this unlikely in our view , as there is no mechanism in this scenario for scalar radiation ( and thus charge ) to escape the system .",
    "we conjecture instead that an unstable charged - scalar soliton , when perturbed , collapses to form a black hole . this black hole could have charged - scalar hair , or could be a reissner - nordstrm black hole without scalar hair .",
    "recent results @xcite suggest that the outcome will depend on the mirror radius .",
    "one could start by evolving our linear perturbation equations in the time domain , to verify our frequency - domain analysis in this paper . to determine the ultimate fate of",
    "the instability would require an evolution of the full nonlinear system employing techniques from numerical relativity @xcite .    in summary",
    ", our investigation complements recent work @xcite which casts fresh light on the fate of the black hole bomb instability . in the einstein - charged scalar field system ,",
    "a consensus has emerged : generically , in both the cavity @xcite and ads @xcite contexts , a charged black hole in vacuum can evolve towards a hairy configuration which is stable .",
    "here , we have shown that , as expected , the hairy black holes in a cavity are accompanied by a wider class of solitonic solutions ; and , further , that both stable and unstable solitons exist .",
    "we have conjectured that the unstable solitons collapse into black holes , though this remains to be investigated .",
    "an important open question is whether any conclusions drawn from studying the charged superradiant instability will apply in the ( potentially astrophysically - relevant ) rotating case , where a class of scalar - hairy four - dimensional kerr black holes @xcite appears to be a plausible candidate for end products of the black hole bomb instability .",

    "in this appendix we outline the proof of the nonexistence of asymptotically flat , static , spherically symmetric , charged - scalar solitons .",
    "we essentially follow the argument in @xcite , adapted to soliton rather than black hole solutions , and restricted to spherically symmetric configurations only .",
    "we start with the static scalar field equation ( [ eq : phiprimeprime ] ) , multiply throughout by @xmath213 and integrate from @xmath49 to @xmath214 : @xmath215 \\ , dr \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\left [ -r^{2}f{\\sqrt { h } } \\phi \\phi ' \\right ] _",

    ", we require that the metric functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 have the following behaviour as @xmath124 : @xmath220 for some @xmath221 . in ( [ eq : metricasympt ] ) , we mean that the largest nonunity term in _ one _ of @xmath41 or @xmath42 is @xmath222 ; it may be that this is the largest subleading term in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but we do not assume that this is necessarily the case .",
    "it is therefore possible that in ( [ eq : metricasympt ] ) , one ( but not both ) of the @xmath222 terms should be @xmath223 according to the strict definition of this notation . in the following , any terms written @xmath224 for some @xmath225 should be interpreted to mean `` no larger than @xmath226 as @xmath124 '' , whether @xmath225 is positive or negative .    using ( [ eq : metricasympt ] )",
    "as described above , the relevant components of the ricci tensor have the following behaviour as @xmath124 : @xmath227 the corresponding components of the trace - reversed stress - energy tensor @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor , must have the same behaviour as ( [ eq : ricciinf ] ) as @xmath124 .",
    "the relevant components of the trace - reversed stress - energy tensor are : @xmath230 considering @xmath231 , we immediately have @xmath232 as @xmath124 .",
    "then @xmath233 and @xmath234 give , respectively , that @xmath235 and @xmath236 as @xmath124 .",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : aprimeprime ] , [ eq : phiprimeprime ] ) then imply that @xmath237 and @xmath238 as @xmath124 . combining these conditions on @xmath43 , @xmath46 and their derivatives as @xmath124",
    ", we deduce that @xmath239 as @xmath124 , where @xmath240 .",
    "therefore the boundary terms from @xmath124 in ( [ eq : phiint ] , [ eq : aint ] ) vanish .    now turn to ( [ eq : aint ] ) . on the right - hand - side of the equality we have the sum of two positive terms .",
    "the only way this sum can be zero is if both positive terms are individually zero",
    ". therefore it must be the case that @xmath241 for all @xmath242 , and furthermore that @xmath243 , so that @xmath43 is a constant everywhere and either @xmath43 or @xmath46 vanishes identically .      in summary ,",
    "the only possible asymptotically flat soliton solution of the field equations ( [ eq : static ] ) is minkowski spacetime with @xmath245 and @xmath46 , @xmath43 constant .",
    "since we have shown that @xmath46 and @xmath43 both tend to zero as @xmath124 , they must both vanish identically .",
    "the above proof begins with the assumption that neither @xmath46 nor @xmath43 vanish identically .",
    "if we have @xmath48 but @xmath246 as a starting point , then ( [ eq : aint ] ) is trivial and the second term in the integral in ( [ eq : phiint ] ) vanishes . in this case",

    "as a result of this assumption , the boundary term in ( [ eq : phiint ] ) vanishes .",
    "the integrand in ( [ eq : phiint ] ) is a single positive term which must therefore vanish identically , giving @xmath47 .    on the other hand , if we assume that @xmath251 but @xmath252 , the system reduces to pure einstein - maxwell theory , for which it is well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that there are no nontrivial soliton solutions .",
