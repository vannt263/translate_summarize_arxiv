    "black hole quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) become ( after some suitable damping timescale ) the dominant contribution arising from arbitrary perturbations of any black hole spacetime .",
    "thus they form the black hole s characteristic `` sound '' .",
    "they are solutions of regge  wheeler ( axial ) , or zerelli ( polar ) equation , with outgoing radiation boundary conditions .",
    "the regge  wheeler ( zerelli ) equation becomes a time - independent schrodinger - like equation for the `` eigenvalues '' @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 are non - real quasi - normal frequencies .",
    "the real parts of the qnm frequencies are spaced symmetrically with respect to the imaginary axis , and with suitable conventions the imaginary part is always positive .",
    "the background black hole spacetime is encoded in the regge ",
    "wheeler ( zerelli ) potential , which typically shows exponential fall - off as one moves towards the event horizon(s ) .",
    "the rate of this fall - off is given by the horizon s surface gravity .",
    "originally , interest was focused on the fundamental lowest damped modes .",
    "one of the methods to calculate them was to approximate the real potential by the analytically solvable pschl  teller potential @xcite . to obtain the fundamental modes one needs to fit the pschl  teller potential by the real potential s peak height and peak curvature .",
    "interest in the highly damped modes ( @xmath3 being large ) significantly increased after hod s conjecture about their relation to black hole thermodynamics was formulated @xcite .",
    "there are good physics arguments to expect that the highly damped modes depend qualitatively on the behavior of the tails of the potential .",
    "( the wave - pocket formed from such modes spreads quickly to the region of the tails of the potential . ) thus approximating the tails of the potential by analytically solvable potentials is expected to bring considerable _ qualitative _ understanding regarding the behavior of highly damped qnms .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , such an approximation is both tractable and informative , at least for the schwarzschild spacetime and schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime .",
    "detailed calculations are contained in @xcite and the basic results are summarized in this paper .",
    "there is a wide agreement regarding the behavior of asymptotic ( highly damped ) quasi - normal modes in the case of schwarzschild asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "they are described by the formula ( see for instance @xcite ) : @xmath4 in this case the tails of the regge ",
    "wheeler ( zerelli ) potential are approximated by the exactly solvable piecewise smooth potential : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the surface gravity of the black hole horizon .",
    "for @xmath7 the solutions giving the outgoing radiation ( for @xmath8 ) are  @xcite @xmath9 , \\qquad(x > 0),\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 are bessel functions with @xmath11 on the other hand , for @xmath12 we have  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hypergeometric function with @xmath15 the equation for qnm modes is obtained from the junction condition : @xmath16 the derivatives of both hypergeometric and bessel functions can be rewritten in terms of hypergeometric and bessel functions themselves . furthermore , at the specific point of interest , the hypergeometric functions can themselves be rewritten in terms of gamma functions , but it is still difficult to look for solutions of ( [ flat ] ) without taking some approximations @xcite .",
    "fortunately from the beginning of the problem we were interested only in highly damped modes , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this case we can approximate both bessel functions and also gamma functions ( after playing with some gamma identites we can apply the stirling formula ) by trigonometric functions",
    ". then ( [ flat ] ) simplifies to the extremely simple condition : @xmath19 the solution of this is : @xmath20 , qualitatively recovering the result ( [ asymptotic ] ) at leading order .",
    "in this situation the exactly solvable potential approximating the tails of regge  wheeler ( zerelli ) potential is  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) : @xmath21 here @xmath22 again denotes the surface gravities of the two horizons ( black hole and cosmological ) .",
    "the solutions of the regge ",
    "wheeler ( zerelli ) equation are @xmath23 where @xmath24 now after applying the junction condition ( [ flat ] ) we can proceed in the same way as previously .",
    "( rewriting derivatives of hypergeometric functions in terms of hypergeometric functions , evaluating the hypergeometric functions at the particular point of interest in terms of gamma functions , using gamma function identities and the stirling approximation for @xmath17 and @xmath25 . ) after some calculations @xcite we obtain : @xmath26 ) - \\cos(-i\\pi\\omega[\\kappa^{-1}_+ + \\kappa^{-1}_- ] ) = 2   \\ ;   \\cos(\\pi\\alpha_+)\\cos(\\pi\\alpha_-).\\ ] ] the solutions of equation ( [ qnf ] ) have numerous interesting properties . in particular : [ section ]    take the case when @xmath27 .",
    "take @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , hence @xmath30 .",
    "then the solutions of ( [ qnf ] ) are given by equi - spaced families of quasi - normal modes : @xmath31 here @xmath32 if @xmath33 is odd and @xmath34 if @xmath33 is even .",
    "the @xmath35 are related to roots @xmath36 of the specific polynomial : @xmath37 } - z^{2p_+ } -   z^{2p_- } - 4\\cos\\left(\\pi\\alpha_+\\right ) \\cos\\left(\\pi\\alpha_-\\right ) z^{[p_+ + p_- ] }   + 1.\\label{polynomial}\\ ] ] [ one ]    [ one]theorem    assume that ( [ qnf ] ) has some set of solutions of the form @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . then the ratio @xmath40 must be rational.[two ]    thus existence of infinite equi - spaced sets of solutions of the equation ( [ qnf ] ) is _ equivalent _ to the rational ratio of surface gravities .",
    "whenever the ratio is rational , the generic number of different equi - spaced families is @xmath41 , as it is related to the number of roots of the polynomial ( [ polynomial ] ) .",
    "we have presented strong physics arguments why our model is likely to give good _ qualitative _ estimates for the qnfs of the real regge - wheeler potential of the sds spacetime .",
    "but `` _ _ qualitative _ _ '' means that only the periodicity with the correct gap structure is recovered , the modes do not have to necessarily _ quantitatively _ match .",
    "( specifically , the @xmath42 mode might differ . ) now , since different families of modes are distinguished only by different @xmath43 the following question can be asked : does the multi - family splitting transfer from our approximate model to the real sds case ?",
    "the answer to this question is suggested by the following statement ( which can be exactly proven ) :    _ assume that the gap structure is of the form given in ( [ one ] ) . assume also that the number of families is a bounded function of the variables @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "then for every point @xmath46 it holds that maximally one qnf can be a continuous function of @xmath44 variables at the point @xmath46 .",
    "_    this statement strongly suggests ( since there are good reasons to expect that qnms are continuous functions of surface gravities ) that if the gap structure transfers to the real physical situation , also the basic features of multi - family splitting must transfer . furthermore @xcite we are able to show that the limit @xmath47 gives in our model the same results as the case @xmath48 . in both cases",
    "we obtain the qnfs of schwarzschild spacetime , which is the expected result .    a complementary set of semi - analytic results for qnfs is obtained by using monodromy techniques @xcite .",
    "all the equations derived by this method ( for schwarzschild , schwarzschild  de sitter , reissner  nordstrm , reissner",
    " nordstrm ",
    "de sitter ) are of the form  @xcite @xmath49 as a result of this , the theorem [ one ] can be completely generalized for all the known analytic results , and the theorem [ two ] is very generic as well ( it holds with very rare and mostly unphysical exceptions ) @xcite .",
