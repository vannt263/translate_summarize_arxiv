    "recently , choptuik , chmaj and bizo @xcite have studied the gravitational collapse of an @xmath2 yang - mills field restricted to spherical symmetry . near the boundary in initial data space between data which form black holes and data which do not ( `` critical collapse '' ) they found two regions with qualitatively different behavior . in `` region",
    "i '' they found a mass gap , with the minimum black hole mass equal to the mass of the bartnik - mckinnon solution , while in `` region ii '' they found the mass scaling and echoing which are by now familiar from critical collapse in other matter models",
    ". the two kinds of behavior are reminiscent of first and second order phase transitions .",
    "we review type i and type ii behavior in section ii .",
    "we shall see that each type of behavior can be understood through the presence of an intermediate attractor .",
    "the type i attractor is the well - known bartnik - mckinnon solution , which is static and asymptotically flat .",
    "the type ii attractor is self - similar and was not known before .",
    "after having derived the necessary field equations in section iii , we construct it as an eigenvalue problem in section iv of this paper . in section",
    "v we construct its linear perturbations in another eigenvalue problem and verify that only one of them is growing .",
    "this allows us to calculate the critical exponent governing the mass scaling semi - analytically , without numerical collapse simulations . in section",
    "vi we summarize our results , which are in good agreement with collapse simulations , discuss how the einstein - yang - mills system differs from other systems in which critical collapse has previously been studied , and put the present paper into perspective .",
    "the analytic and numerical methods of this paper are a generalization of those developed for the spherical scalar field in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the scalar field system the field equations contain a length scale @xmath3 ( in units @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the coupling constant in the yang - mills - covariant derivative @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of a scale in the field equations excludes the existence of an exactly self - similar solution .",
    "instead we make a series ansatz for a solution which becomes self - similar asymptotically on spacetime scales much smaller than @xmath3 , or equivalently for curvatures much greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the echoing period @xmath8 is determined by the leading term of the expansion alone . for the linearized equations we also make a series ansatz , but",
    "the spectrum @xmath9 of lyapunov exponents is once more determined by the first term of that series alone . moreover , to calculate the first term of the perturbation expansion one only needs to know the first term of the background expansion .",
    "therefore the higher terms of either expansion are not required in order to calculate both the echoing period @xmath8 and critical exponent @xmath10 exactly , and will not be calculated here .",
    "here we summarize the findings of choptuik , chmaj and bizo @xcite and explain them in dynamical systems terms .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show that critical phenomena are , in hindsight , easy to explain , to stress the mathematical similarities between type i and type ii critical behavior , and to motivate the more technical calculations in the following sections .    for introductory reviews of critical collapse ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "very briefly , one wants to study the limit in phase space between initial data which eventually form a black hole and data which do not .",
    "choptuik @xcite pioneered the method of ( numerically ) evolving initial data taken from one - parameter families of initial data which cross this boundaries , families of data , in other words , which form a black hole for large values of the parameter , @xmath11 , but not for small values .",
    "generic families have this property . by bisection",
    "one can numerically determine the critical value @xmath12 of @xmath11 for a given family .",
    "for the spherically symmetric massless scalar field choptuik found that the black hole mass could be made arbitrarily small , and scaled like @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the same for all families of data .",
    "furthermore , before forming the black hole , the time evolution from all data with @xmath15 sufficiently small , from all families , approached one universal solution with the strange property of being periodic in the logarithm of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or @xmath18 , with a period of @xmath19 .",
    "the smaller @xmath15 , the more `` echos '' were visible before the black hole formed or before the fields dispersed to infinity .    for the spherically symmetric @xmath20 yang - mills field , choptuik , chmaj and",
    "bizo @xcite found the same behavior , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 in some region of initial data space , and called it `` type ii behavior '' because the black hole mass resembles the order parameter in a second - order phase transition . in another region of initial data space",
    "they found that as @xmath11 went through @xmath12 , the black hole mass jumped to a finite value instead of showing power law behavior . before the black hole formed ,",
    "the solution approached a regular static solution of that mass , and remained there for the longer the smaller @xmath15 was .",
    "they named this `` type i behavior '' , in analogy with a first - order phase transition .    without keeping up the sense of mystery any longer",
    ", we now explain these phenomena in dynamical systems terms @xcite through the presence of an `` intermediate attractor '' , a solution which has precisely one growing perturbation .",
    "we shall introduce a compact notation which focuses on the essential similarities and dissimilarities of the two types , while hiding the details , and which will also be useful later on : by @xmath23 we denote the vector of variables of some first - order form of the field equations , such that , for example , the complete field equations in spherical symmetry can be compactly written as @xmath24 .",
    "the presentation is best begun with type i behavior .",
    "type i behavior is dominated by the bartnik - mckinnon solution @xcite , which is static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat .",
    "it has exactly one unstable perturbation mode @xcite , which makes it an intermediate attractor in dynamical systems terms .",
    "let @xmath25 denote this solution .",
    "as it depends only on @xmath16 , its general linear perturbation must be of the form @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are free constants .",
    "there is exactly one unstable mode , that is @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the final state arising from initial data @xmath31 is a black hole for one sign of @xmath32 , and flat space with outgoing waves for the other .",
    "let @xmath11 be the parameter of a one - parameter - family of initial data , such that for @xmath33 a black hole forms , and for @xmath34 the solution disperses .",
    "then for @xmath35 sufficiently small , the time evolution of data from the family enters an intermediate asymptotic regime of the form @xmath36 where the decaying perturbations ( @xmath37 ) can already be neglected , and where we have approximated @xmath38 linearly .",
    "this solution leaves the intermediate asymptotic regime to form a black hole or disperse at a time @xmath39 when the amplitude of the perturbations , @xmath40 , has reached some small fiducial value @xmath32 .",
    "this gives a lifetime @xmath41 of the meta - stable state , where @xmath42 depends on the one - parameter family , but where @xmath43 is universal .",
    "this was in fact observed by choptuik , chmaj and bizon , and used to estimate @xmath44 , in good agreement with perturbation theory .",
    "the intermediate attractor in regime ii is self - similar instead of static .",
    "it is in fact discretely self - similar , but that is not an essential detail , and for clarity of comparison with regime i we pretend in the introduction , and only here , that it is continuously self - similar .",
    "we also disregard the fact that the self - similarity is only asymptotic on small scales . in suitable coordinates",
    "@xmath45 then depends only on @xmath46 instead of only on @xmath16 .",
    "its general linear perturbation must be of the form @xmath47 once more there is exactly one growing mode .",
    "( this is required for the explanation we are about to give to work , and we will demonstrate it explicitly in section iv . ) the intermediate asymptotic regime for type ii behavior is @xmath48 one now argues from scale - invariance @xcite that the black - hole mass @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath39 , and obtains for the black hole mass @xmath50 where @xmath51 is universal , and @xmath42 is a family - dependent constant .    if the scale - invariance is only asymptotic , as it is for scalar electrodynamics or einstein - yang - mills , the scaling argument to calculate the black hole mass goes through unchanged @xcite . if the critical solution is discretely self - similar , as for the scalar field or the model considered here , with an echoing period of @xmath8 in the logarithm of the length and time scales , a periodic `` wiggle '' @xcite or `` fine structure '' @xcite is superimposed on the mass scaling law , which becomes @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a universal periodic function with period @xmath54 .",
    "( note that the same family - dependent constant @xmath42 appears a second time in the argument of @xmath53 . )",
    "the form of the critical solution and its perturbations is also more complicated , and will be discussed in section iv.a and v.a respectively .",
    "in this section we introduce coordinates and field variables for the spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills system that are adapted to type ii behavior , where scale - invariance plays a crucial role . in the following we consider only type ii behavior , and",
    "no longer write the index ( ii ) .",
    "we adopt the conventions and notation of @xcite , which include making both the yang - mills field and the coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 dimensionless by absorbing suitable factors of @xmath55 , @xmath42 and @xmath5 into them .",
    "the spherically symmetric spacetime metric is written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend only on @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the yang - mills field strength is given in terms of a single potential @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the pauli matrices . in order to write the field equations in first order form , we define @xmath62 the complete field equations , reduced to spherical symmetry , are @xmath63 these equations are the yang - mills equation , and three of the four algebraically independent components of the einstein equations .",
    "the fourth component is obtained by combining derivatives of the other three , and is therefore redundant .    in order to construct a discretely self - similar solutions",
    ", we follow @xcite in defining new coordinates @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a periodic function to be determined , with period @xmath8 .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , discrete self - similarity is equivalent to @xmath57 and @xmath58 being periodic in @xmath68 . in the field equations",
    "we make the replacements @xmath71 , \\qquad r = e^{\\tau + \\zeta + \\xi_0(\\tau)}\\ ] ] to transform to the new coordinates .",
    "we shall be looking for a solution in which @xmath57 and @xmath58 are periodic .",
    "what does this mean for the matter variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ?",
    "the einstein equations suggest that @xmath72 and @xmath73 should be periodic too , but @xmath74 can not be periodic because of the explicit presence of the factors @xmath75 in the equations . nor",
    "can we simply absorb such a factor into the definition of @xmath74 to make it periodic .",
    "this means that the equations have no nontrivial self - similar ( periodic ) solutions .",
    "the physical reason is the presence of the length scale @xmath3 in the problem , which is only hidden by the dimensionless variables . following a suggestion by matt choptuik @xcite",
    ", we define a new scalar field @xmath76 by @xmath77 with this definition , the two potential terms arising in the field equations , @xmath78 split into the sum of a term which no longer contains @xmath16 explicitly , plus terms containing positive powers of @xmath16 , which become negligible on small spacetime scales ( as @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) .",
    "two further definitions , namely @xmath81 and @xmath82 , will be useful because @xmath83 alone determines the ingoing and outgoing null geodesics , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the components of the matter field propagating along them .    in the following ,",
    "we use the coordinates @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the fields @xmath86 . in these variables , the complete field equations , including the definitions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 in terms of @xmath76 , are @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 as suggested by the way we have written the equations , the first five can be treated as evolution equations in @xmath67 , with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath68 , and the last two as constraints which are propagated by the evolution equations . note",
    "that now only positive powers of @xmath75 appear explicitly , so that in the limit @xmath89 we are left with a set of nontrivial , scale - invariant equations for @xmath23 .",
    "the terms multiplied by @xmath75 are `` irrelevant '' in the language of renormalisation group theory @xcite .",
    "the equations are invariant under @xmath90 , and the potential for @xmath74 has the two minima @xmath91 . in ( [ sdef ] ) we have assumed that @xmath92 asymptotically . a solution tending to @xmath93",
    "can be trivially obtained from one tending to @xmath94 by changing the sign of @xmath74 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while leaving @xmath76 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 unchanged .",
    "the field equations are left unchanged .",
    "in this section we construct the solution @xmath95 which dominates type ii behavior . to find a solution which is asymptotically self - similar in the limit @xmath80 , that is on spacetime scales smaller than the intrinsic scale of the field equations",
