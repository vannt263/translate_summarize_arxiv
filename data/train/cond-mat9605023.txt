    "electronic transport through n - s and s - s junctions and weak links has been the object of interest for many years @xcite .",
    "much of the theoretical understanding of these systems has been obtained by analyzing simple models where a one - dimensional character is assumed @xcite .",
    "these kind of models have been very useful for clarifying the microscopic origin of basic phenomena like the excess current in n - s and s - s contacts and the subgap structure in s - s and s - insulator - s ( s - i - s ) junctions . in particular , the one - dimensional scattering model introduced by blonder et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as btk ) has provided a simple way of analyzing the transport properties in terms of normal electron transmission and andreev reflection probabilities .    with the recent advances in the fabrication of nanoscale devices",
    "@xcite , a closer comparison between the predictions of simple quasi one - dimensional theories and experimental results is now at hand . refs .",
    "@xcite provide two different examples of the progress made in the experimental achievement of a superconducting quantum point - contact ( sqpc ) .",
    "this possibility has provoked a renewed interest in more detailed and quantitative analysis of models involving a few conducting channels .",
    "it turns out that , in spite of its apparent simplicity , the case of a single channel sqpc still contains non - trivial physical behavior at certain regimes .",
    "single mode contacts have been analyzed recently by different authors @xcite who have obtained new quantitative results for the case of small applied voltage where multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) play a crucial role .",
    "some of these recent works @xcite illustrate the existence of a variety of regimes controlled by the contact transmission and quasiparticle damping in the small bias limit .",
    "a full understanding of the different regimes , together with the transitions between them remains to be explored .",
    "this will be thoroughly analyzed in this paper .",
    "traditionally , quantum transport in microelectronic devices has been mainly addressed by two different approaches : one is based on the scattering picture first introduced by landauer @xcite in which the transport properties are expressed in terms of transmission and reflection scattering amplitudes .",
    "this approach is generally used in a phenomenological way by replacing the device with a simple scattering structure .",
    "the natural extension of this picture to the superconducting case was provided by the already mentioned btk model .",
    "a different point of view arises when the problem is analyzed starting from a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "we shall very generally call `` hamiltonian approach '' the theories which take this starting point",
    ". the origin of this approach can be traced back to the work by bardeen who introduced the tunnel hamiltonian approximation for describing a tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "most of the calculations based on this tunnel hamiltonian were restricted to the lowest order transport processes like in the calculation of the josephson current in a s - i - s junction @xcite .",
    "multi - particle tunneling processes ( mpt ) were first discussed by schrieffer and wilkins @xcite as a possible explanation for the observed subgap structure in superconducting tunnel junctions .",
    "the contributions of these higher order processes were found to be divergent , which has led to the quite extended belief that the hamiltonian approach is pathological except for describing the lowest order tunneling processes .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is to show that starting from a very simple model hamiltonian describing a single channel contact it is possible to obtain results for n - s and s - s contacts in agreement with those provided by scattering theory .",
    "as will be shown below inclusion of higher order processes up to infinite order eliminates the pathologies associated with finite order perturbation theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the hamiltonian approach in combination with non - equilibrium green function techniques presents its own advantages . in recent publications",
    "we have shown how this approach can be generalized for dealing with situations where self - consistency of the superconducting order parameter is needed @xcite . moreover , the formulation in terms of green functions is specially well suited for dealing with correlation effects when strong e - e interactions are present @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the general model for a superconducting weak link in a local representation is introduced .",
    "in particular , we discuss how this model can be simplified in order to describe a single mode contact .",
    "we then introduce the non - equilibrium green function formalism by means of which the total current through the contact can be expressed . in section iii",
    "we analyze the more simple",
    "n - n and n - s contacts .",
    "the study of the n - n case allows us to define the contact transmission coefficient in terms of the microscopic parameters of our model . the complete correspondence with the results of the btk scattering theory is then established by analyzing the n - s contact . for this last case",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the total current as a function of the contact transmission .",
    "section iv is devoted to the s - s case .",
    "we first show how the problem of the calculation of the ac current components can be reduced to the evaluation of an algebraic set of linear equations .",
    "this allows us to study in detail the general features of the dc and ac @xmath0 characteristics for the whole range of voltages and transmissions .",
    "we finally concentrate on the limit @xmath1 where the more interesting and less understood physics takes place .",
    "section v is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper we shall consider  point contact - like \" geometries consisting very generally of two wide ( 3d or 2d ) electrodes connected by a narrow constriction .",
    "the constriction length , @xmath2 , is assumed to be much smaller than the superconducting coherence length and its width , @xmath3 , comparable to the fermi wavelength , @xmath4 . for a sufficiently short constriction",
    "the detailed form of the self - consistent order parameter and electrostatic potential in the region between the electrodes becomes irrelevant @xcite allowing us to represent them by simple step functions . on the other hand",
    ", the condition @xmath5 implies that there is only a reduced number of quantum transverse channels through the constriction .",
    "one can think of different experimental realizations of such a physical situation , like for instance the recently developed atomic size break - junctions @xcite and the split - gate s-2deg - s sqpc of takayanagi et al .",
    "these two situations are schematically represented in fig . 1 .",
    "the analysis of the transport and electronic properties of such a system would involve , for the most general case where both electrodes are superconductors , the solution of the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdeg ) equations @xcite . in previous works",
    "we have developed an approach to these kind of problems in which the bdeg equations are formulated in a site representation @xcite .",
    "this representation can be viewed either as a tight - binding description of the electronic states or as a discretization of the bdeg equations .",
    "the first case would be more suitable for describing systems like an atomic size contact ( fig .",
    "1 a ) , while the second could be used to represent constrictions involving a 2deg in semiconducting heterostructures ( fig .",
    "1 b ) . in the absence of applied fields",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian giving rise to the bdeg equations would take the form    @xmath6    where @xmath7 run over the sites used to represent the system . by appropriately choosing the different parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 one can model different junction geometries @xcite . in order to analyze the case of biased contacts",
    "it is convenient to simplify this model hamiltonian taking the step - like behavior of the order parameter and electrostatic potentials in a point contact geometry into account .",
    "to do this we take the complex order parameter and the chemical potentials as constants on the left and right electrodes ( denoted by ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) respectively ) .",
    "the case of a single quantum channel connecting both electrodes can then be described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the uncoupled electrodes while the hopping term describes the electron transfer processes between the outermost sites on both electrodes .",
    "we would like to stress that , although this is a very simple model hamiltonian ( formally equivalent to a tunnel hamiltonian ) , it contains the relevant physics of a quantum point contact which depends essentially on the contact normal transmission coefficient . in our model",
    "this transmission can vary between @xmath16 ( tunnel limit ) and @xmath17 ( ballistic regime ) as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this will be discussed in section iii .    for the case of a symmetric superconducting contact in the presence of an applied bias voltage",
    "@xmath19 it is convenient to perform a gauge transformation @xcite by means of which hamiltonian ( 2 ) adopts the following time - dependent form    @xmath20    where the superconducting phase difference @xmath21 appears as a phase factor in the hopping elements .      within the previously introduced model , the average total current through the contact is given by    @xmath22    where , depending on the gauge choice , @xmath18 can include a time dependent phase like in eq .",

    "calculation of the integrals in eq .",
    "( 29 ) leads to    @xmath137    in agreement with the recent prediction of bratus et al .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath138 the subgap structure is completely washed out and there appears an excess current even in the small bias limit .",
    "the other relevant feature of the dc current , namely the large voltage excess current , can be analytically evaluated within our model for any transmission value .",
    "the main simplification in this limit comes from the fact that only the lowest order andreev reflection process gives a significant contribution to the excess current @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can truncate the system of equations ( 26 ) for harmonic indexes @xmath139 , the resulting simplified system can then be solved explicitly for @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( for details see appendix b ) . as shown in this appendix",
    "the simple result @xmath142 is obtained for any value of the transmission .",
    "although this is the expected physically sound result , to our knowledge , it has not been shown explicitly before except for the ballistic case @xcite . moreover , some authors have reported the existence of a negative excess current for low transmissions @xcite which seems to be in contradiction with the above result .",
    "however , one should notice that the excess current as defined above is an asymptotic quantity ( only valid in the @xmath143 limit ) .",
    "when corrections of order @xmath144 are taken into account one actually can have a defect instead of an excess current for sufficiently low transmission .    the algorithm described in subsection",
    "a allows an efficient evaluation of the higher order ac components of the current . for the following analysis",

    "the analysis of the higher order components reveals a decay for @xmath152 close to a inverse power law . as a consequence of this slow decay ,",

    ". this will be the subject of the next subsection .",
    "in this subsection we concentrate on the @xmath153 case , which turns out to exhibit a remarkable variety of different regimes according to the values of the parameters @xmath154 and the inelastic scattering rate @xmath33 .",
    "as it is well known , the main difficulty for obtaining quantitative results in this limit lies in the fact that the number of mar contributing to the current grows with decreasing @xmath125 as @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes of these multiple processes do not decay when @xmath156 leading to the appearance of divergencies in the perturbative expansion in the coupling @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "again , a complete summation of the perturbative series is needed in order to regularize these divergencies .",
    "an additional difficulty arises , as will be discussed below , from the fact that the limits @xmath157 and @xmath158 do not actually commute .",

    "we summarize the main results for both regimes and analyze the conditions for their actual observability in a real sqpc .    within our formalism ,",

    "the presence of a small but finite @xmath33 or @xmath125 ( whichever is larger ) introduces an effective damping into the otherwise infinite series of mar .",
    "when this effective damping is due to a finite @xmath33 ( @xmath166 ) a linear regime can be defined where the total current is given by @xmath167 , @xmath168 being a phase - dependent linear conductance @xcite . within this linear regime",
    ", one can identify two different sub - regimes according to the ratio @xmath169 .",
    "the case @xmath170 corresponds to a situation where mar are very weakly damped and give the dominant contribution to the current .",
    "the physical picture one can have in mind is that of electrons and holes andreev - reflecting between the electrodes for a very long time before being inelastically scattered @xcite . in order to illustrate the dominant contribution of the processes inside the gap for the weakly damped case",
    ", we represent in fig .",
    "5 the current density corresponding to the @xmath171 component for three values of the transmission .",
    "three important features of this linear regime are displayed in this figure : firstly , the current density inside the gap increases as @xmath172 therefore giving the dominant contribution in the weakly damped case ; secondly , there is a region inside the gap of width @xmath173 in which the current density vanishes .",
    "this is the forbidden energy region for bound states at a given transmission . finally , in fig .",
    "5 ( c ) one can observe that the contribution of the continuum outside the gap becomes important as @xmath174 . in the limit @xmath175 a second sub - regime is reached where the contributions of mar are heavily damped and the current is dominated by single quasi - particle tunneling processes .",
    "the transition between these two sub - regimes has been analyzed with detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to identify the actual sub - regime for a real sqpc an estimation of the order of magnitude of @xmath33 is needed . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath33 is estimated from the electron - phonon interaction to be a small fraction of the gap for traditional superconductors .",
    "thus , our theory predicts that a real sqpc would generally fall into the weakly damped case except for extremely low transmissions .    for this sub - regime",
    "the supercurrent @xmath176 and the linear conductance @xmath168 can be obtained analytically as discussed in appendix c. in particular , for @xmath168 one obtains    @xmath177 ^ 2 \\beta , \\ ] ]    where @xmath178 is the position of the bound states inside the gap and @xmath179 .",
    "this expression for large transmission and small temperatures gives a phase - dependence which is in qualitative agreement with the few available experimental results , performed in non - mesoscopic contacts @xcite .",
    "the unusual phase - dependence of eq .",
    "( 34 ) which deviates strongly from the @xmath180 form predicted by the standard tunnel theory may explain the old controversy between tunnel theory and experiments known as the @xmath180 problem @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when the truncation of the infinite series of mar is caused by a finite @xmath125 ( with negligible @xmath33 ) , analytical results have only been obtained in the quasi - ballistic limit , i.e. @xmath138 . a closer inspection of the @xmath0 curves in the small bias region and for @xmath57 reveals that the supercurrent components decay exponentially from its value at @xmath80 with a collapsing width @xmath181 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 ( a ) where a blow up of the behavior of @xmath182 for small bias voltages and quasi - ballistic transmissions is shown . in the limit @xmath138",
    "the supercurrent becomes a delta function at @xmath80 . on the contrary ,",
    "the dissipative components in this same limit tend to a finite value outside the region of width @xmath181 .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig . 6 ( b ) where @xmath183 is plotted in the same magnified scale as @xmath182 .",
    "the summation of these dissipative components for @xmath184 and very small @xmath125 yields ( see appendix c )    @xmath185    in agreement with the result recently derived by averin and bardas @xcite .",
    "the existence of a region of decreasing width @xmath186 in which this crossover from supercurrent to dissipative current takes place can be associated with the collapse of the forbidden region for mar inside the superconducting gap taking place when @xmath138 . in this way , when @xmath125 is small compared to the width of the forbidden region the excitation of quasi - particles from states at @xmath187 into states at @xmath188 is negligible and there is no appreciable dissipative current ; whereas the opposite situation holds for @xmath189 .",
    "averin and bardas @xcite have described this crossover as a landau - zener transition in which the non - dissipative and the dissipative components scale with @xmath51 and @xmath125 as @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively , where @xmath192}$ ] .",
    "the numerical results for sufficiently small @xmath193 and @xmath194 are well fitted by these scaling laws . however",
    ", a careful analysis reveals that their range of validity around @xmath195 and @xmath96 decreases strongly when increasing the component number .    in summary ,",
    "in this small bias limit one can identify four different sub - regimes depending on the relative values of parameters @xmath33 , @xmath154 and @xmath196 .",
    "the prediction of the actual behavior of a real sqpc in this limit would therefore require a careful estimation of all these parameters . in this respect",
    ", one should keep in mind that while @xmath196 and @xmath51 can be varied experimentally in a rather controlled way , the inelastic scattering rate @xmath33 is an intrinsic property of the superconducting electrodes much more difficult to control .",
    "the unavoidable presence of some degree of inelastic scattering can prevent the actual observability of the crossover from non - dissipative to dissipative behavior described after eq .",
    "the requirement of @xmath197 together with that of @xmath57 can actually imply @xmath198 which would rather correspond to the linear regime .",
    "finally , when considering the experimental test of all these theoretical predictions the relevance of noise in a real sqpc should be taken into account .",
    "recent theoretical predictions @xcite suggest that the magnitude of thermal noise in a single mode superconducting device can be extremely large near ballistic conditions .",
    "in the present work we have presented a hamiltonian approach for describing the transport properties of single mode n - s and s - s contacts .    it has been explicitly demonstrated that this approach is , with some simplifying assumptions , equivalent to the phenomenological scattering approach .",
    "we believe that the present work can help clarifying the somewhat recurrent discussion about the unsuitability of a hamiltonian approach for obtaining the transport properties of a n - s or s - s contact : when performing the calculations up to infinite order in the coupling @xmath18 all the unphysical divergences are eliminated and the results become equivalent to those of scattering theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the present approach has been applied to discuss in detail the dc and ac @xmath0 characteristics of a sqpc . in particular ,",
    "we have concentrated on the less understood small bias voltage limit where one can identify four different sub - regimes depending on the values of the contact transmission and inelastic scattering rate . finally , we have discussed the conditions for the experimental observability of the theoretical predictions in this limit .",
    "although in the present work we have restricted the discussion to the simplest single - mode case with an energy - independent transmission coefficient , the general model introduced in section ii can describe more complex situations which may be relevant for a closer comparison with recent experiments @xcite .",
    "work along this line is under progress .        in this appendix",
    "we describe the algorithm for evaluating the ac current components in a s - s biased contact .",
