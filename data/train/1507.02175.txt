    "interaction quenches in quantum many body systems have become an active research field @xcite , mainly thanks to the great degree of controllability of ultracold atoms with feshbach resonances and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "recently , a complementary platform for quantum many body physics that has been developed , namely exciton - polariton quantum fluids @xcite .",
    "the distinctive characteristic of these systems is that the polaritons are a superposition of light and matter excitations .",
    "a first advantage of the light component is that it allows for a straightforward diagnostic of the fluid by means of standard quantum optical techniques .",
    "a second advantage is that polaritons can be created by an external laser field .",
    "it is this feature of polariton condensates that is of particular interest in the context of quantum quenches , since it allows to implement a sudden change in the many body system .",
    "the situation that we will consider here is an instantaneous injection of polaritons in a coherent state @xcite .",
    "since this is not the ground state of the interacting many - body system , a non - trivial time evolution will result . in our previous work",
    ", we have shown that a dynamical casimir effect @xcite takes place in terms of the bogoliubov excitations on top of the coherently created polariton state . indeed , the sudden creation of a condensate quenches the vacuum from the trivial one to the bogoliubov vacuum , resulting in an excitation of the system .",
    "part of the motivation for the study of the dynamical casimir effect stems from connections with the hawking - unruh effect , whose sonic version @xcite is getting within the reach of experiments with polaritons @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the analogy with an interaction quench in cold atom systems is direct , since our proposal is equivalent to a sudden increase of the interaction strength , from zero to a finite value .",
    "such experiments have been performed with ultracold atoms , for example , hung _",
    "@xcite suddenly decreased the interaction strength in a weakly interacting atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the resulting density oscillations were related to sakharov oscillations in the early universe @xcite .",
    "an even closer connection can be made with the splitting quench by langen _",
    "_ in one - dimensional atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "when a condensate is rapidly split in two parts , there is initially perfect phase coherence between them .",
    "however , at later times , the two parts start to develop a different phase .",
    "this dephasing due to interactions is entirely analogous to the one in our dynamical casimir proposal , showing a light - cone - like emergence of thermal correlations .",
    "an important difference between polaritonic and atomic condensates concerns the ratio of the life time with respect to the characteristic time scale of the dynamics . whereas for ultracold atoms",
    ", this ratio is very large , in polariton systems losses are more important .",
    "their theoretical modelling should therefore be carried out in an open system setting .",
    "this raises the interesting issue of the competition between losses and thermalization dynamics .    we will treat the open system quantum dynamics within the truncated wigner approximation , which is a popular tool in both the study of conservative cold atoms @xcite as for lossy polariton systems @xcite .",
    "when the condensate depletion is small , the equations of motion can be linearized in the fluctuations , which is equivalent to the bogoliubov approximation .    in sec . [",

    "when a microcavity is excited sufficiently close to the lower polariton branch and all the relevant energy scales ( linewidth , interaction energy ) are much smaller than the rabi splitting , it is well justified to restrict the dynamics to the lower polariton branch .",

    "the polariton field is in a coherent state with amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the external laser drive then only sets the initial condition and does not affect the polariton dynamics , which is governed by the free bose gas dynamics and the losses only",
    ".    we will solve the master equation within the truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) , a method that is widely used for the simulation of weakly interacting one - dimensional atomic condensates .",
    "the addition of losses makes the twa even a better approximation to the exact dynamics .",
    "the resulting stochastic equations of motion read @xcite : @xmath12 \\phi(x , t ) \\ , dt \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\gamma}{4 \\delta v } } dw(x , t ) , \\label{eq : wigev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the volume of a single cell of the discretized grid .",
