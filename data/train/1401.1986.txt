    "the effective description of the low - energy degrees of freedom , known as landau fermi liquid theory , is obtained after coarse graining the high - energy fluctuations of the system by means of a renormalization group procedure .    in our case",
    "such a coarse - graining does not apply as we are interested in the short to intermediate time dynamics of an interacting many body system which is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "thus , in order to work only with the low energy degrees of freedom , we must appeal to the observation made in the main text that for long - range interactions ( i.e. those for which the characteristic momentum transfer is smaller than the fermi momentum , @xmath77 ) and short to intermediate times after the interaction is quenched , the production of particle - hole pairs with small momentum dominates the dynamics .",

    "the only exchange terms left are those with @xmath138 which are indistinguishable of the diagonal terms of the forward scattering terms .",

    "the bosonized hamiltonian can be finally written as @xmath147 one important thing to notice is that the interaction potential @xmath40 that appears in the bosonized interaction hamiltonian above is the _ bare _ interaction between the fermions .",

    "<S> the latter drive the system to its ultimate stationary state , which often correspond to a thermal state . a simple model to understand this is the response of a conductor to a quench in the electric field , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the heaviside function . </S>",

    "<S> is the characteristic time scale at which the system crosses over from stage one to stage two . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we take this separation for granted and construct a non - perturbative description of the first stage of the thermalization of a fermi gas after a quench in which the interaction is suddenly switched on . unlike earlier studies  @xcite , the fermions are assumed to be spinless and the interaction long - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> this type of quench can be realized experimentally ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : protocol ] ) in atomic quantum degenerate dipolar fermi gases , which have recently become available  @xcite .    on the theory side , our approach also allows us to identify the integrals of motion that constrain the dynamics leading to the prethermal state . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by first truncating the interaction term of the hamiltonian and retaining only forward - scattering interactions between the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> interactions leading to inelastic inter - particle collisions , which , according to what has been described above , set in at longer times are therefore neglected . </S>",

    "<S> the major difference is that our truncated hamiltonian is written in terms of the _ bare _ interaction , instead of a renormalized interaction between landau quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as in landau flt  @xcite , the truncated hamiltonian exhibits a gauge @xmath16 symmetry in momentum space , which renders the dynamics exactly soluble .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we solve for the dynamics of the truncated hamiltonian by performing a change to a basis where the particle - hole excitations of the fermi gas are described by a set of a harmonic oscillator modes ( tomonaga bosons ) at each point of the fermi surface ( fs )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because the density operator , when projected to the neighborhood of the fs , obeys a set of anomalous commutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> the approach , known as fs bosonization  @xcite , allows to threat the truncated hamiltonian non - perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> the technique focuses on the low - energy fs degrees of freedom , which are most affected at short times after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , for a long - ranged interaction , small - momentum interactions are dominant , and thus particle - holes in the neighborhood of the fs are created at short times .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the conserved quantities of the truncated hamiltonian can be identified as the occupation operators of the tomonaga bosons . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also allows us to unveil the close relationship linking prethermalization , dephasing dynamics , and gge for a generic fermi liquid of _ finite _ dimensionality , which is very similar to the phenomena observed in exactly solvable models in one space dimension ( 1d )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for 1d systems recent numerical studies  @xcite have shown that the description provided in refs .   </S>",
    "<S> is fairly accurate and universal and that even the dynamics at rather long times can be described by the gge although mode coupling has been shown to lead to thermalization  @xcite . in the two dimensional case , we find similarities and also important differences with 1d . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the picture that emerges from the bosonization treatment of the two - dimensional fermi liquid suggest that the first stage following the quench can be regarded as a collective _ non - equilibrium _ quasi - particle dressing by the interactions of the non - interacting fermions ( or , for that matter , the bare quasi - particles ) that are the fermionic excitations of the initial hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ non - equilibrium _ dressing is best displayed by the time - evolution of the discontinuity at the fermi momentum of the ( zero - temperature ) momentum distribution , @xmath17 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a similar behavior of @xmath17 has been observed in interaction quenches in 1d  @xcite , but a major difference with the present case is that @xmath19 , indicating the non - equilibrium dressing leads to a complete destruction of the fermionic quasi - particles in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau exhibited by @xmath17 after the initial rapid ( gaussian - like ) decay can be regarded as a consequence of the system reaching a state that relaxes very slowly . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this plateau is a signature of a prethermalized state . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , this relation implies that , to the lowest order in the interaction strength , all the energy injected into the system by the quench , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , is transformed into kinetic energy in the stationary ( prethermalized ) state  @xcite . as to the role of higher order corrections to this picture </S>",
    "<S> , we find by direct diagonalization of the bosonic hamiltonian that the quench also excites the collective mode of the fermionic system and that the excitation energy is _ almost _ completely transferred for long times after the quench into kinetic energy , i.e. , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) is the kinetic energy in the steady ( ground ) state and @xmath89 is a correction arising from the collective mode that is of order @xmath90 for weak interactions , and therefore not seen in perturbative calculations at the lowest orders .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the statistical description of the stationary prethermalized state . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we recall that the truncated hamiltonian is a ( bosonic ) bilinear and , consequently , that dephasing implies that _ all _ correlations in the steady state are described by a gge  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote with @xmath91 the bosonic basis that diagonalizes the hamiltonian  , the gge density matrix can be written as @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are the conserved quantities , @xmath94 $ ] and the lagrange multipliers @xmath95 are obtained from the initial conditions , @xmath96 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also have explicitly checked that the density matrix   reproduces all the studied quantities in the prethermalized state . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the conserved quantities can be easily refermionized , at least formally . using the matrix transformation that diagonalizes the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> they can be expressed as linear combination of products of two patch densities .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally take up the dynamics at finite @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> an isotropic horizon effect in the correlations  @xcite arises at the lowest order in the expansion of @xmath98 $ ] in powers of the interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it can be shown  @xcite that in the spatio - temporal region defined by @xmath99 we can approximately neglect the spatial dependence of @xmath100 and , with it , the patch index . outside the light cone , @xmath99 , the interaction correction is therefore approximately the same for all patches : @xmath101 and the full correlation function thus reads @xmath102 , i.e. , the correlations retain the same spatial dependence as in the initial state up to a time - dependent prefactor . this factor defines the time - dependent quasiparticle residue that is analyzed below . in the opposite limit , @xmath103 </S>",
    "<S> , we can neglect the temporal dependence and the steady state correlations dominate : @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turn to the dynamics of the discuntinuity of the momentum distribution at @xmath105 . for short times </S>",
    "<S> @xmath106 we find a gaussian decay of @xmath17 from its initial value of one : @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the density of states at the fs and @xmath109 is an @xmath110 constant that stems from the angular integration over the fs . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian decay at short times is independent of the form of the interaction and it also occurs in 1d  @xcite . for @xmath111 , the form of the interaction is required , and upon choosing @xmath112 , we find : @xmath113,\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the stationary - state quasiparticle residue and @xmath115 a positive constant . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : z ] we illustrate the dynamics of the quasiparticle residue for different interaction strengths and @xmath116 .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the quench dynamics of a fermi gas with long - range interactions using fs bosonization . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to obtain the full space - time dependence of the non - equilibrium density - matrix as well as the evolution of ( the zero - temperature ) discontinuity of the momentum distribution at @xmath105 after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that prethermalization can be understood as the result of dephasing between the bosonic fs excitations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the statistical description of the prethermalized state in terms of the generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) has been obtained and the integrals of motion needed for its constuction have been identified as the eigenmodes of the bosonic fs hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the interaction quench described above can be experimentally realized in a quantum degenerate dipolar fermi gas of , e.g. , @xmath117er atoms  @xcite confined to a 2d trap . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the protocol are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : protocol ] . based on the results of this work </S>",
    "<S> , we predict that , for a weak to moderate interaction quench , the system will exhibit a prethermalized state . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will show up as a quasi - stationary state in a two stage thermalization process : after an initial rapid change , the momentum distribution will settle down in a non - thermal behavior different from the final thermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the kinetic energy should rapidly reach its final value . in future work , grounded on the results reported here </S>",
    "<S> , we shall explore different aspects of the quench dynamics , in particular , the final stage of the thermalization dynamics when terms that break integrability are included .    </S>",
