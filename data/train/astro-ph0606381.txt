    "linear polarization can be an important diagnostic of relativistic jets and accretion flows associated with black hole systems . in the case of the massive black hole in the galactic center , sgr a * , the properties of its mm - wavelength linear polarization probes the accretion environment on scales inaccessible with other techniques ( bower et al.1999a , b ; aitken et al.2001 ; bower et al.2001 ; bower et al.2003 ; marrone et al.2006 ) . the apparent absence of linear polarization at wavelengths exceeding 2.7 mm and sharp rise in polarization fraction at shorter wavelengths sets an upper limit to the rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "this limits the mass accretion rate to @xmath11 at distances of @xmath12 schwarzschild radii from the black hole , which eliminates certain classes of accretion flow ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ; agol 2000 ) , but is consistent with cdaf and jet models ( e.g. falcke , mannheim and biermann 1993 ) .",
    "the rm measures the accretion rate by serving as a proxy for the electron column density once coupled with assumptions about the magnetic field .",
    "equipartition between kinetic , magnetic and gravitational energy is often assumed to relate the electron density and magnetic field ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "1999a ; melia & falcke 2001 ; marrone et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the discovery of variations in both the polarization angle ( bower et al.2005 ) and fraction ( marrone et al.2006 ) suggests two potential sources of variability .",
    "the variations may be intrinsic and , therefore , offer evidence on the nature and structure of the emission region on a scale of @xmath13 .",
    "changes in the rm along the line of sight may also induce external polarization variability .",
    "structure in the accretion region on all scales within the bondi radius can contribute to rm variations .",
    "there is thus strong motivation to accurately characterize the rm , its fluctuations , and the intrinsic variability of the polarized source .    in  2 we present the detection of linear polarization of sgr a * at 3.5 mm , showing that it varies on short timescales as well as relative to historical non - detections . combining this in  3 with other data , our detection yields the best constraints so far on the rm .",
    "we discuss the nature of the accretion flow and on the intrinsic source properties in  4 .",
    "sgr a * was observed with the bima array at 3.5 mm between 28 march and 01 april 2004 ut .",
    "all five observations were obtained in identical lst time ranges that corresponded roughly to 11 to 16 ut .",
    "observations were obtained in a polarimetric mode that produced stokes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 images , with the two frequency bands centered on 82.76 and 86.31ghz , each with 800 mhz bandwidth .",
    "data were calibrated assuming that the flux density of j1733 - 130 was steady at its mean value of 2.7jy .",
    "j1733 - 130 was observed for 5 minutes every 30 minutes .",
    "observations were obtained in the b configuration giving a resolution of @xmath18 in position angle ( p.a . )",
    "the data were filtered to remove spacings shorter than 20k@xmath20 , similar to the processing of previous sgr a * polarization experiments .",
    "this @xmath21@xmath22 distance cutoff gives a total flux estimate accurate to better than 10% from 8.4 to 86 ghz ( bower et al.2001 ) .",
    "a priori amplitude calibration using system temperature and default gain information was applied to j1733 - 130 .",
    "both sources were phase self - calibrated .",
    "polarization leakage terms from observations of 3c279 on 11 november 2003 were applied .",
    "numerous sources of error contribute to the accuracy with which we can measure the polarization fraction and p.a .. in addition to statistical errors that include noise from the sky and the telescope , the leakage of polarization from one polarization handedness to the other is an important effect .",
    "this converts a fraction of the total intensity into a false polarization signal .",
    "leakage calibration uses observations of a bright calibrator source and simultaneously solves for the polarization of the source and the leakage terms appropriate for individual antennas .",
    "imperfect correction leaves a residual false polarization signal and introduces errors that exist in the calibrator observation .",
    "bima leakage solutions at 1.3 mm were found to be stable over periods of months to years ; variability in the solutions were due to changes in receiver orientation ( bower , wright & forster , 2002 ) .",
    "typical variations in antenna leakage terms were @xmath23 over 2 years , indicating a @xmath24 variation in the average leakage solution for the 9 bima antennas . solutions at 3.5 mm are expected to have the same characteristics although this has not been studied in depth .",
    "in addition to variations in the leakage error , statistical errors in the calibrator data introduce errors .",
    "a comparison of actual measured p.a.s of 3c 279 at 3.5 mm and 1.3 mm from bima with measured p.a.s at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm from the vla indicate excursions of 10@xmath3 20@xmath3 ( bower et al.2002 ) .",
    "these deviations exceed those expected from leakage corrections and statistical errors .",
    "they are possibly real source effects but may also be uncorrected instrumental errors .",
    "the average flux densities of sgr a * and linear polarization e - vectors are listed in table [ fluxtable ] . in the polarization fraction and p.a .",
    "errors we include the effect of a 0.5% polarization leakage error .",
    "this error propagation is accurate in the case of the high snr detections in the lsb but presents a lower limit to the errors in the low snr detections in the usb .",
    "inter - day flux density variations are detected at a significant level , with a reduced-@xmath25 of 4.9 for the hypothesis of constant flux density for sgr a * for 4 degrees of freedom .",
    "the mean flux density is @xmath26jy and the rms variability amplitude is @xmath27jy .",
    "polarization was detected in all five epochs , making this the first detection of polarization at 3.5 mm , the longest wavelength at which polarization has been detected in sgr a*. the mean polarization fraction is @xmath1% and its mean p.a .",
    "is @xmath28 . the polarization fraction and p.a",
    ".  vary from day to day .",
    "the detection of polarization is more robust in the lsb ( 82.8 ghz ) than in the usb ( 86.3 ghz ) .",
    "the origin of this difference is unclear",
    ". it may be due to changes in the leakage corrections and/or poor phase stability at the higher frequency .",
    "we have previously seen data from bima in which polarization results in one sideband were more reliable than in the other ( bower et al.2001 ) .",
    "the bandwidth used in these observations is sufficiently small that the linear polarization is not depolarized by rotation of the polarization vector across the observing band , as discussed below .",

    "the consistency of the observations over a large number of disjoint epochs and frequencies with a single rm further suggests that the underlying accretion rate is constant on the timescale over which the observed polarization pas were averaged .",
    "the uncertainty in our rm fit places an upper bound on the accretion rate variations using @xmath90 , valid under the assumption of equipartition between magnetic , kinetic and gravitational energy ( e.g. marrone et al.2006 ) .",
    "the 7% uncertainty in the rm implies @xmath91 fluctuations less than @xmath10% .",
    "the limit on @xmath91 variations is largely consistent with the limits imposed by source flux density variations . in the jet model",
    "the flux density scales as @xmath92 ( falcke et al.1993 ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the 3.5 mm fluxes is 10% , comparable to the errors on the individual measurements , which imposes an upper limit of 14% on @xmath91 fluctuations .",

    "the five intensity measurements from bower et al.(2005 ) at 216230ghz exhibit 29% modulations , implying @xmath91 fluctuations of 40% .",
    "variability in polarization fraction is detected by all multi - epoch observations ( fig.[figpolnlabel ] ) , at 85 , 230 and 340ghz , and presumably occurs at 112ghz , where it was not detected at the 1.8% ( 1-@xmath30 ) level by a previous search ( bower et al .",
    "2001 ) . a previous limit of 1% linear polarization at 86ghz ( bower et al.1999b ) demonstrates that it also varies on long timescales .",
    "since the faraday screen is external to the source the polarization amplitude fluctuations must be intrinsic .",
    "instrumental depolarization effects are too low to explain the variability : bandwidth depolarization is only important for rms greater than @xmath93radm@xmath6 at 85ghz , while beam depolarization is similarly improbable given the sub - mas size of sgr a * at mm wavelengths ( bower et al . 2004 ; shen et al .",
    "spatial variation in the rm across the transverse extent of the source could depolarize the emission , but at even 85ghz this requires rm fluctuations @xmath94radm@xmath6 ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "both the high variability of the mm and sub - mm emission ( zhao et al.2004 ; wright & backer 1993 ; tsuboi et al.1999 ) and the linearly polarized emission of sgr a * are possibly associated with its excess sub - mm emission ( serabyn et al.1997 ; falcke et al.1998 ; melia et al.2001 ) .",
    "adaf models that fit the cm to - sub - mm spectrum include at least two distinct populations of radiating particles ( yuan et al.2003 ) , with the second important at @xmath95ghz in order to explain the sub - mm bump .",
    "the model of yuan et al.(2003 ) , in which the sub - mm emission is dominated by thermal electrons , overpredicts the polarization fraction at 85ghz ( cf .",
    "fig.[figpolnlabel ] ) . in this model",
    "the degree of linear polarization ranges from 32% at 85ghz to 70% at 400ghz assuming a uniform magnetic field and that faraday depolarization intrinsic to the source is unimportant ( see their fig.3b ) . in the context of this model",
    "the ratio of the predicted to observed polarization levels can only be attributed to magnetic field inhomogeneity intrinsic to the source .",
    "this ratio is a factor of 3 higher at 85ghz relative to the fraction in the range @xmath96ghz , over which it is constant within the errors .",
    "it is hard to account for such an increase in magnetic field inhomogeneity at 85ghz , particularly if the source size only scales @xmath97 , as expected if its emission is self - absorbed . on the other hand , including synchrotron self - absorption effects , goldston , quataert & igumenshchev ( 2005 ) show that the polarization fraction is expected to increase by a factor of three over the range @xmath98ghz . the quasi - spherical accretion polarization model of melia ,",

    "previous 86 and 112ghz non - detections are marked with arrows .",
    "the error bars in the aitken et al.(2001 ) measurements , marked with triangles , reflect uncertainty in the contribution from dust emission rather than variability associated with the source . ]",
    "we have reported here the detection of linear polarization in sgr a * at 3.5 mm .",
    "this enables us to calculate the rotation measure and set a limit on the accretion rate .",
    "the lack of frequency dependence for position angle fluctuations indicates that they are intrinsic to the source .",
    "our result favors riaf / cdaf accretion models , with a shallow density distribution , over adaf and bondi - hoyle accretion flows , which have a steep profile and are more likely to produce rapid rm variations .",
    "future wide bandwidth simultaneous observations with carma and the sma will fully characterize intrinsic and extrinsic changes in the polarization properties of sgr a * and allow us to investigate the accretion environments of other nearby low luminosity agn , such as m81 * ( brunthaler , bower & falcke 2006 ) .",
