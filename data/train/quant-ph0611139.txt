    "in other work @xcite two dimensional fields of quantum reference frames were described that were based on different quantum theory representations of the real numbers . because the description of the fields does not seem to be understood , it is worthwhile to approach a description in a way that will , hopefully , help to make the fields better understood .",
    "this the goal of this contribution to the third feynman conference proceedings .",
    "the approach taken here is based on three main points :    * there are a large number of different quantum theory representations of natural numbers , integers , and rational numbers as states of qubit strings .",
    "these arise from gauge transformations of the qubit string states . * for each representation , cauchy sequences of rational string states give a representation of the real ( and complex ) numbers .",
    "a reference frame is associated to each representation . *",
    "each frame contains a representation of all mathematical and physical theories .",
    "each of these is a mathematical structure that is based on the real and complex number representation base of the frame .",
    "this approach is summarized in the next section with more details given in the following sections .",
    "as is well known , the large amount of work and interest in quantum computing and quantum information theory is based on quantum mechanical representations of numbers as states of strings of qubits and linear superpositions of these states .",
    "the numbers represented by these states are usually the nonnegative integers or the natural numbers",
    ". examples of integer representations are states of the form @xmath0 and their linear superpositions @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a state of a string of @xmath3 qubits where the qubit at location @xmath4 denotes the sign ( as @xmath5 ) and @xmath6\\rightarrow            \\{0,1\\}$ ] is a @xmath7 valued function on the integer interval @xmath8 $ ] where @xmath9 this last condition removes the redundancy of leading @xmath10    this description can be extended to give quantum mechanical representations of rational numbers as states of qubit strings @xcite and of real and complex numbers as cauchy sequences of rational number states of qubit strings @xcite . as will be seen , string rational numbers",
    "can be represented by qubit string states @xmath0 where @xmath11 is a @xmath7 valued function on an integer interval @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the sign qubit @xmath15 , at position @xmath4 .",
    "a basic point to note is that there are a great many different representations of rational numbers ( and of integers and natural numbers ) as states of qubit strings .",
    "besides the arbitrariness of the location of the qubit string on an integer lattice there is the arbitrariness of the choice of quantization axis for each qubit in the string .",
    "this latter arbitrariness is equivalent to a gauge freedom for the choice of which system states correspond to the qubit states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this arbitrariness of gauge choice for each qubit is discussed in section [ gt ] in terms of global and local gauge transformations of rational string states of qubit strings .",
    "a different representation of string rational numbers as states of qubit strings is associated with each gauge transformation .    as will be seen in the next section",
    ", there is a quantum representation of real numbers associated with each representation of the rational string states .",
    "it is clear that there are a large number of different representations of real numbers as each representation is associated with a different gauge gauge representation of the rational string states .    the gauge freedom in the choice of quantization axis for each qubit plays an important role in quantum cryptography and the transfer of quantum information between a sender and receiver .",
    "the choice of axis is often referred to a reference frame chosen by sender and receiver for transformation and receipt of quantum information @xcite .    here",
    "this idea of reference frames is taken over in that a reference frame @xmath18 is associated with each quantum representation @xmath19 of real numbers .",
    "since each real number representation is associated with a gauge transformation @xmath20 , one can also associate frames directly with gauge transformations , as in @xmath21 instead of @xmath22    it should be noted that complex numbers are also included in this description since they can be represented as an ordered pair of real numbers . or they can be built up directly from complex rational string states . from now on real numbers and their representations will be assumed to also include complex numbers and their representations .",
    "an important point for this paper is that any physical or mathematical theory , for which the real numbers form a base or scalar set , has a representation in each frame as a mathematical structure based on the real number representation in the frame .",
    "since this is the case for all physical theories considered to date , it follows that they all have representations in each frame as mathematical structures based on the real number representation in the frame .",
    "it follows that theories such as quantum mechanics , quantum field theory .",
    "qed , qcd , string theory , and special and general relativity all have representations in each frame as mathematical structures based on the real number representation associated with the frame .",
    "it is also the case that , if the space time manifold is considered to be a @xmath23 of the real numbers , then each frame contains a representation of the space time manifold as a @xmath23 of the real number representation .    to understand these observations better",
    "it is useful to briefly describe theories . here",
    "the usual mathematical logic @xcite characterization of theories as being defined by a set of axioms is used .",
    "all theories have in common the logical axioms and logical rules of deduction ; they are distinguished by having different sets of nonlogical axioms .",
    "this is the case whether the axioms are explicitly stated or not .",
    "each theory described by a consistent set of axioms has many representations ( called models in mathematical logic ) as mathematical structures in which the theory axioms are true . depending on the axiom set the representations may or may not be isomorphic .",
    "the real numbers axiomatized as a complete ordered field are an example of a simple theory . for this axiomatization",
    "all representations of the real numbers are isomorphic .",
    "however they are not the same .",
    "all theories based on the real ( or complex ) numbers include the real ( and complex ) number axioms in their axiom sets .",
    "these well known aspects of theories are are quite familiar in the application of group theory to physics .",
    "each abstract group is defined by a set of axioms that consist of the general group axioms and additional ones to describe the particular group considered .",
    "each group has many different representations as different mathematical systems .",
    "these can be matrices or operators in quantum theory .",
    "these are further classified by the dimensionality of the representation and whether they are reducible or irreducible .",
    "the importance of different irreducible representations to describe physical systems and their states is well known .    as sets of axioms and derived theorems , physical theories , unlike mathematical theories , also have representations as descriptions of physical systems and their properties .",
    "it is immaterial here whether these representations are considered to be maps from theory statements to physical systems and their properties or from different mathematical representations of the theory to physical systems and their properties .",
    "it is , however , relevant to note that theoretical predictions to be tested by experiment are or can be represented by equations whose solutions are real numbers .",
    "spectra of excited states of nuclei , atoms , and molecules are examples .",
    "the same holds for observables with discrete spectra such as spin , isospin , and angular momentum . here",
    "the eigenvalues are the real number equivalents of integers or rational numbers .",
    "it is useful to begin with a question `` what are the real numbers ? ''",
    "the most general answer is that they are elements of any set of mathematical or physical systems that satisfies the real number axioms .",
    "the axioms express the requirements that the set must be a complete , ordered field .",
    "this means that the set must be closed under addition , multiplication and their inverses , a linear order must exist for the collection , and any convergent sequence of elements converges to an element of the set .",
    "it follows that all sets of real numbers must at least have these properties .",
    "however they can have other properties as well .",
    "a study of most any mathematical analysis textbook will show that real numbers are defined as equivalence classes of either dedekind cuts or of cauchy sequences of rational numbers .. ] a sequence @xmath24 of rational numbers is a cauchy sequence if@xmath25 the proof that the set of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences are real numbers requires proving that it is a complete ordered field .",
    "a similar situation holds for rational numbers ( and integers and natural numbers ) .",
    "rational numbers are elements of any set that satisfies the axioms for an ordered field .",
    "however the field is not complete .",
    "the representation of rational numbers used here will be based on finite strings of digits or kits in some base @xmath26 along with a sign and @xmath27 point .",
    "use of the string representation is based on the fact that physical representations of rational numbers ( and integers and natural numbers ) are given as digits or states of strings of kits or qukits ( with a sign and @xmath27 point for rational numbers ) in some base @xmath28 .",
    "such numbers are also the base of all computations , mainly because of the efficiency in representing large numbers and in carrying out arithmetic operations .",
    "the usefulness of this representation is based on the fact that for any base @xmath29 these string numbers are dense in the set of all rational numbers .    here , to keep things simple ,",
    "representations will be limited to binary ones with @xmath30 the representations will be further restricted here to be represented as states of finite strings of qubits .",
    "this is based on the fact that quantum mechanics is the basic mechanics applicable to all physical systems .",
    "the cauchy condition will be applied to sequences of these states to give quantum theory representations of real numbers .",
    "it should be noted that there are also quantum theory representations of real numbers that are not based on cauchy sequences of states of qukit strings .",
    "besides those described in @xcite there are representations as hermitian operators in boolean valued models of zf set theory @xcite and in a category theory context @xcite .",
    "these representations will not be considered further here because of the limitation here of representations to those based on finite strings of qubits .      here",
    "a compact representation of rational string states is used that combines the location of the @xmath31 point and the sign .",
    "for example , the state @xmath32 is a state of eight @xmath7 qubits and one @xmath33 qubit representing a rational string number @xmath34 in the ordinary decimal form .",
    "qubit strings and their states can be described by locating qubits on an integer lattice rational string states correspond to states of qubits occupying an integer interval @xmath35.$ ] here @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the location of the @xmath33 qubit , and the @xmath7 qubits occupy all positions in the interval @xmath35.$ ] note that two qubits , a sign one and a @xmath7 one , occupy position @xmath38 for fermionic qubits this can be accounted for by including extra variables to distinguish the qubit types .",
    "one way to describe rational string states is by strings of qubit annihilation creation ( ac ) operators @xmath39 acting on a qubit vacuum state @xmath40 also present is another qubit type represented by the ac operators @xmath41 .",
    "here @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are integers .    for this work",
    "it is immaterial whether the ac operators satisfy commutation relations or anticommutation relations : @xmath44=            \\delta_{j , j^{{\\prime}}}\\delta_{{\\alpha},{\\alpha^{{\\prime } } } } \\\\",
    "\\mbox{$[{a^{\\dag}_{{\\alpha},j}},{a^{\\dag}_{{\\alpha}^{{\\prime}},j^{{\\prime}}}}]=[{a_{{\\alpha},j}},{a_{{\\alpha}^{{\\prime}},j^{{\\prime}}}}]=0$}\\end{array}\\]]or @xmath45 with similar relations for the @xmath46 operators .",
    "the @xmath46 operators commute with the @xmath47 operators .",
    "rational number states are represented by strings of @xmath47 creation operators and one @xmath46 creation operator acting on the qubit vacuum state @xmath16 as @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 integers , and @xmath52\\rightarrow           \\{0,1\\}$ ] is a @xmath53 valued function on the integer interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "alternatively @xmath11 can be considered as a restriction to @xmath12 $ ] of a function defined on all the integers .",
    "an operator @xmath54 can be defined whose eigenvalues correspond to the values of the rational numbers one associates with the string states .",
    "@xmath54 is the product of two commuting operators , a sign scale operator @xmath55 , and a value operator @xmath56 one has@xmath57 the operator is given for reference only as it is not used to define arithmetic properties of the rational string states .",
    "there is a large amount of arithmetical redundancy in the states .",
    "for instance the arithmetic properties of a rational string state are invariant under a translation along the integer axis .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that these properties of the state are determined by the distribution of @xmath58 relative to the position @xmath37 of the sign and not on the value of @xmath37 .",
    "the other redundancy arises from the fact that states that differ in the number of leading or trailing @xmath59 are all arithmetically equal .",
    "these redundancies can be used to define equivalence classes of states or select one member as a representative of each class . here the latter choice will be made in that rational number states will be restricted to those with @xmath60 for the sign location and those with @xmath11 restricted so that @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 if @xmath64 this last condition removes leading and trailing @xmath10 the state @xmath65 is the number @xmath4 . for ease in notation from now on the variables",
    "@xmath66 will be dropped from states . thus states @xmath67",
    "will be represented as @xmath0 with the values of @xmath68 included in the definition of @xmath11 .",
    "there are two basic arithmetic properties , equality , @xmath69 and ordering @xmath70 arithmetic equality is defined by @xmath71 here @xmath72 the set of integers @xmath73 for which @xmath74 and similarly for @xmath75 that is , two states are arithmetically equal if one has the same distribution of @xmath58 relative to the location of the sign as the other .",
    "arithmetic ordering on positive rational string states is defined by @xmath76 where@xmath77 the extension to zero and negative states is given by@xmath78    the definitions of @xmath79 can be extended to linear superpositions of rational string states in a straightforward manner to give probabilities that two states are arithmetically equal or that one state is less than another state .",

    "it is often useful to write the addend state as @xmath88 more details on the arithmetic operations are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that these operations are quite different from the usual quantum theory superposition , product , etc . operations .",
    "this is the reason for the presence of the subscript a.      the arithmetic operators can be used to define rational number properties of rational string states and their superpositions .",
    "they can also be used to define the cauchy condition for a sequence of rational string states .",

    "this view from the parent frame @xmath195 is the same view that we have as observers outside the whole frame structure .",

    "viewed from the outside there is no fixed abstract space time representation as a 4-tuple of real numbers associated with the field as a whole .",
    "all space time representations of this form are internal and associated with each frame .",
    "this is based on the observation that the points of a continuum space time as a 4-tuple of representations of the real numbers are different in each frame because the real number representations are different in each frame .",
    "also , contrary to the situation for the fields in figs .",
    "[ rcst1]-[rcst3 ] , there is no representation of the space time points that can be considered to be as fixed and external to the frame field .",
    "the lack of a fixed abstract , external space time manifold representation for the two - way infinite and cyclic frame fields is in some ways similar to the lack of a background space time in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "there are differences in that in loop quantum gravity space is discrete on the planck scale and not continuous @xcite .",
    "it should be noted though that the representation of space time as continuous is not a necessary consequence of the frame fields and their properties .",
    "the important part is the real and complex number representation base of each frame , not whether space time is represented as discrete or continuous .",
    "it is useful to summarize the views of observers inside frames and outside of frames for the different field types .",
    "for all the fields except the cyclic ones an observer in any frame @xmath253 at stage @xmath73 sees the real number base @xmath255 of his frame as abstract and external with no properties other than those given by the axioms for a complete ordered field .",

    "this includes the point that , to internal observers in a frame , the real and complex number base of the frame is abstract and external .    for frame fields with a fixed ancestor frame @xmath195 , figs .",
    "[ rcst1 ] , [ rcst2 ] , [ rcst3 ] , the view of an outside observer is almost the same as that of an observer in frame @xmath195 .",

    "both can also see the field structure for all frames in the fields .",
    "however the outside observer can see that frame @xmath195 has no ancestors .",
    "this is not available to an observer in @xmath195 as he / she can not see the whole frame field .",
    "the cyclic frame field is different in that for an observer in any frame at stage @xmath257 frames at other stages are both descendent and ancestor frames .",
    "this suggests that the requirement that a frame observer can not see the field structure for ancestor frames , but can see it for descendent frames , may have to be changed , at least for this type of frame field .",
    "how and what one learns from such changes are a subject for future work .",
    "so far , frame fields based on different quantum mechanical representations of real and complex numbers have been described .",
    "each frame contains a representation of physical theories as mathematical structures based on the real number representation base of the frame .",
    "the representations of the physical theories in the different frames are different because the real ( and complex ) number representations are different .",
    "they are also isomorphic because the real ( and complex ) number representations are isomorphic .",
    "the description of the frame field given so far is incomplete because nothing has been said about the relation of the frame field to physics .",
    "so far the only use of physics has been to limit the description of rational number representations to quantum mechanical states of strings of qubits .",
    "the main problem here is that to date all physical theories make no use of this frame field .",
    "this is evidenced by the observation that the only properties of real numbers relevant to physical theories are those derivable from the real number axioms for a complete , ordered field .",
    "so far physical theories are completely insensitive to details of different representations of the real numbers .",
    "this problem is also shown by the observation that there is no evidence of this frame structure and the multiplicity of real number representations in our view of the existence of just one physical universe with its space time manifold , and with real and complex numbers that can be treated as absolute and given .",
    "there is no hint , so far , either in physical theories or in properties of physical systems and the physical universe , of the different representations and the frame fields .",
    "this shows that the main problem is to reconcile the great number of different representations of the real and complex numbers and the @xmath194 space time manifold as bases for different representations of physical theories with the lack of dependence of physical theories on these representations and no evidence for them in our view of the physical universe .",
    "one possible way to do this might be to collapse the frame field to a smaller field , ideally with just one frame . as a step in this direction one could limit quantum theory representations of rational string numbers to those that are gauge invariant .",
    "this would have the effect of collapsing all frames @xmath253 at any stage @xmath73 into one stage @xmath73 frame is a gauge transformation .",
    "it is not the @xmath258 element of one . ] .",
    "the resulting frame field would then be one dimensional with one frame at each stage .",
    "the idea of constructing representations that are gauge invariant for some gauge transformations has already been used in another context .",
    "this is the use of the decoherent free subspace ( dfs ) approach to quantum error correction .",
    "this approach @xcite is based to quantum error avoidance in quantum computations .",
    "this method identifies quantum errors with gauge transformations @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the goal is to find subspaces of qubit string states that are invariant under at least some gauge @xmath20 and are preserved by the hamiltonian dynamics for the system .",
    "one way to achieve this is based on irreducible representations of direct products of @xmath133 as the irreducible subspaces are invariant under the action of some @xmath20 . as an example",
    ", one can show that @xcite the subspaces defined by the irreducible 4 dimensional representation of @xmath259 are invariant under the action of any global @xmath20 .",
    "the subspaces are the three dimensional subspace with isospin @xmath260 , spanned by the states @xmath261 and the @xmath262 subspace containing @xmath263 the action of any global @xmath20 on states in the @xmath260 subspace can change one of the @xmath264 states into linear superpositions of all states in the subspace . but it does not connect the states in the @xmath260 subspace with that in the @xmath262 subspace .",
    "it follows that one can replace a string of @xmath265 qubits with a string of @xmath90 new qubits where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states of the @xmath258 new qubit correspond to any state in the respective @xmath260 and @xmath262 subspaces of the 4 dimensional representation of @xmath266 any state of the @xmath90 new qubits is invariant under all global gauge transformations and all local gauge transformations where @xmath267    this replacement of states of strings of @xmath265 qubits by states of strings of @xmath90 new qubits gives the result that , for all @xmath20 satisfying eq . [ ueq ] , the @xmath188 frames at any stage @xmath73 all become just one frame at stage @xmath73 .",
    "however this still leaves many gauge @xmath20 for which the new qubit string state representation is not gauge invariant .",
    "another method of arriving at a gauge invariant description of rational string states is based on the description of the kinematics of a quantum system by states in a hilbert space @xmath268 based on the @xmath133 group manifold .",
    "details of this , generalized to all compact lie groups , are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in essence this extends the well known situation for angular momentum representations of states based on the manifold of the group @xmath269 to all compact lie groups .    for the angular momentum case",
    "the the action of any rotation on the states @xmath270 gives linear combinations of states with different @xmath37 values but with the same @xmath128 value .",
    "the hilbert space spanned by all angular momentum eigenstates can be expanded as a direct sum @xmath271 where @xmath272 labels the irreducible representations of @xmath273 qubits can be associated with this representation by choosing two different @xmath128 values , say @xmath274 and @xmath275 then any states in the subspaces @xmath276 and @xmath277 correspond to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 qubit states respectively .",
    "these states are invariant under all rotations .",
    "extension of this construction to all finite qubit strings gives a representation of natural numbers , integers and rational numbers that is invariant under all @xmath269 gauge transformations .",
    "this development can also be carried out for any compact lie group where the quantum kinematics of a system is based on the group manifold @xcite . in the case of @xmath133 eq .",
    "[ hl ] holds with @xmath278 .",
    "the momentum subspaces @xmath279 are invariant under all @xmath133 transformations . as in the angular momentum case one",
    "can use this to describe states of qubits as @xmath280 that are @xmath133 invariant .",
    "this construction can be extended to states of finite strings of qubits .",
    "details of the mathematics needed for this , applied to graphs on a compact space manifold , are given in @xcite . in this way one can describe representations of rational string numbers that are @xmath133 gauge invariant for all gauge @xmath20 .",
    "there is a possible connection between these representations of numbers and the ashtekar approach to loop quantum gravity .",
    "the ashtekar approach @xcite describes @xmath281 valued connections on graphs defined on a @xmath282 space manifold where @xmath281 is a compact lie group .",
    "the hilbert space of states on all graphs can be represented as a direct sum of spaces for each graph .",
    "the space for each graph can be further decomposed into a sum of gauge invariant subspaces .",
    "this is similar to the spin network decomposition first described by penrose @xcite .",
    "the connection to qubit strings is made by noting that strings correspond to simple one dimensional graphs .",
    "states of qubit strings are defined as above by choosing two @xmath128 values for the space of invariant subspaces as in eq .",
    "[ invqub ] .",
    "it is hoped to describe more details of this connection in future work .",
    "implementation of this approach to reduction of the frame field one still leaves a one dimensional line of iterated frames .",

    "[ rcst3 ] , two way infinite , fig .",
    "[ rcst4 ] , or closed , fig .",
    "[ rcst5 ] .",
    "because the two way infinite and cyclic fields have no abstract external sets of real and complex numbers and no abstract external space time , it seems appropriate to limit consideration to them . here",
    "the cyclic field may be the most interesting because the number of the iterations in the cycle is undetermined .",
    "if it were possible to reduce the number to @xmath4 , then one would end up with a picture like fig .",
    "[ rcst1 ] except that the @xmath123 and @xmath193 base of the frame would be identified in some sense with the gauge invariant representations described in the frame . whether this is possible , or even desirable , or not , is a problem left to future work .",
    "another approach to connecting the frame field to physics is based on noting that the independence of physical theories from the properties of different real and complex number representations can be expressed using notions of symmetry and invariance .",
    "this is that @xmath283 note that the gauge transformations apply not only to the qubit string states but also to the arithmetic relations and operations on the string states , eqs .",
    "[ = au ] and [ addau ] , to sequences of states , to the cauchy condition eq .",
    "[ cauchyu ] , and to the definition of the basic field operations on the real numbers .",
    "the symmetry of physical theories under these gauge transformations suggests that it may be useful to drop the invariance and consider at the outset candidate theories that break this symmetry .",
    "these would be theories in which some basic aspect of physics is representation dependent .",
    "one approach might be to look for some type of action whose minimization , coupled with the above requirement of gauge invariance , leads to some restriction on candidate theories .",
    "this gauge theory approach is yet another aspect to investigate in the future .",
    "there are some points of the material presented here that should be noted .",
    "the gauge transformations described here apply to finite strings of qubits and their states .",
    "these are the basic objects . since these can be used to represent natural numbers , integers , and rational numbers in quantum mechanics , one can , for each type of number , describe different representations related by @xmath133 gauge transformations on the qubit string states . here",
    "this description was extended to sequences of qubit string states that satisfied the cauchy condition to give different representations of the real numbers .",
    "a reference frame was associated to each real and complex number representation .",
    "each frame contains a representation of all physical theories as mathematical structures based on the real and complex number representation base of the frame .",
    "if the space time manifold is considered to be a @xmath23 of the real numbers , then each frame includes a representation of space time as a @xmath23 of the real number representation .",
    "if one takes this view regarding space time , it follows that for all frames with an ancestor frame , an observer outside the frame field or an observer in an ancestor frame sees that the points of space time in each descendent frame have structure as each point is an equivalence class of cauchy sequences of ( or a cauchy operator on ) states of qubit strings .",
    "it is somewhat disconcerting to regard space time points as having structure .",
    "however this structure is seen only by the observers noted above .",
    "an observer in a frame @xmath195 does not see his or her own space time points as having structure because the real numbers that are the base of his frame do not have structure .",
    "relative to an observer in frame @xmath195 , the space time base of the frame is a manifold of featureless points .",
    "it should also be noted that even if one takes the view that the space time manifold is some noncompact , smooth manifold that is independent of @xmath284 one still has the fact that functions from the manifold to the real numbers are frame dependent in that the range set of the functions is the real number representation base of the frame .",
    "space time metrics are good examples of this . as is well known they play an essential role in physics .    in quite general terms",
    ", this work is motivated by the need to develop a coherent theory that treats mathematics and physics together as a coherent whole @xcite .",
    "it may be hoped that the approach taken here that describes fields of frames based on different representations of real and complex numbers will shed light on such a theory .",
    "the point that these representations are based on different representations of states of qubit strings shows the basic importance of these strings to this endeavor .",
    "finally it should be noted that the structure of frames emanating from frames has nothing to do with the everett wheeler view of multiple universes @xcite .",
