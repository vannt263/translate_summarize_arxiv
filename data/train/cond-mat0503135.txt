    "the high - energy excitation at @xmath44 , however , does not have a simple interpretation in terms of the sine - gordon model .",

    "the adjusted excitation energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ figdispersion]a , illustrating that magnetic spectral weight generally shifts to lower energies in an applied field",
    ". however , due to the @xmath14-induced gap , this effect is much less pronounced than in a uniform field as the ground state energy increases.@xcite",
    "we now present a simple mean - field theory of interacting @xmath0=@xmath1 fermions which captures both the emergence of a new excitation at high energies and the dispersion of the bound spinon states .",
    "as it is well known , a mean - field approach usually is not adequate to solve a one dimensional system .",
    "this is because , for finite range interactions , the fluctuations are strong enough to preclude a non - zero value of an order parameter at any fine temperature .",
    "moreover , if the order parameter is associated with a continuous symmetry , its mean value is zero even at t=0 .",
    "consequently , a mean field theory that assumes a non - zero value of the order parameter with excitations that are originated by small fluctuations of such quantity can not be a good description of a general one dimensional system .    in the present case , the system is invariant under rotations around the @xmath49 axis for @xmath50 and the candidate to be the order parameter is the @xmath51 planar component of the staggered magnetization @xmath52 .",
    "as expected for a continuous symmetry and a gapless spectrum , the system is critical at @xmath53 , i.e. , the order parameter has divergent fluctuations .",
    "however , the staggered field @xmath50 couples linearly with the order parameter @xmath54 along the @xmath55 direction .",
    "consequently , for @xmath56 , the u(1 ) rotational symmetry is explicitly broken and the mean value of @xmath54 becomes non - zero at any temperature .",
    "this also changes the nature of the excitations .",
    "the spinons ( kink and antikinks ) are no longer the low energy quasiparticles of the system since a pair of them is now confined by a linear potential .",
    "a similar effect occurs when we increase the dimension of the system due to the interchain interaction .",
    "therefore , we expect a mean - field treatment to be good approach for high enough values of @xmath14 .    for @xmath50 , we know that the theory must be critical with the associated linear soft modes shown in fig.[figdispersion]a .",
    "we also know that one dimensional spin system can be mapped into a fermionic system .",
    "in addition , a non - interacting fermionic hamiltonian has a ground state that is also critical and has linear soft modes like the ones shown in fig.[figdispersion]a .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to use a fermionic representation for the mean - field approach . for this purpose ,",
