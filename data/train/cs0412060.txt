    "it is well known that the capacity of a single - input single - output coherent rician fading channel is monotonic in the magnitude of the line - of - sight ( los ) component .",
    "this can be easily deduced from the facts that the channel capacity is achieved by a zero - mean circularly - symmetric gaussian input and that a non - central chi - square random variable is stochastically monotonic in the non - centrality parameter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  6.2  ( b ) ) , @xcite .",
    "this result extends easily to the single - input multiple - output and , with a little more work , to multiple - input single - output scenarios , from the similar stochastic monotonicity for the non - central chi - square random variable of a higher degree .",
    "the extension to the mimo case , which may look straightforward at first , requires some extra care , however .",
    "the first difficulty one encounters is that in order to demonstrate the monotonicity , one has to introduce an ordering on the los matrices and it is _ a priori _ unclear what the natural ordering is for the problem at hand .",
    "the second difficulty is that there is no closed - form expression for the capacity - achieving input distribution .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that the capacity is achieved by a circularly - symmetric multivariate gaussian input , but no closed - form expressions for the eigenvalues of the optimal covariance matrix are known .",
    "finally , as in the single - input case , under a fixed input distribution , one los matrix may give rise to a larger information rate for a given realization than another los matrix , but it may actually perform worse when averaged over all fading realizations .    in this paper",
    "we show that the natural ordering on the los matrices @xmath2 is given by the loewner partial order on @xmath3 , and through this ordering we extend the monotonicity results to the mimo rician channels .",
    "more specifically , we say that the @xmath4 los matrix @xmath0 is `` larger than or equal to '' the @xmath4 los matrix @xmath5 , if @xmath6 is greater than or equal to @xmath7 in the loewner sense , i.e. , if @xmath8 is a positive semidefinite @xmath9 matrix . induces a _ preorder _ on the los matrices @xmath2 , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 implies @xmath12 , but _ not _ @xmath13 .",

    "we shall also extend the discussion to the multiple - access channel ( mac ) .",
    "the mac poses an additional challenge in that the capacity region depends not only on the los matrices of different users individually , but also on how these matrices relate to each other .",
    "this requires a joint preorder on los matrices , as will be made clear in the next section .",
    "it should be emphasized that our monotonicity results are proved when the distribution of the granular component is held fixed .",
    "consequently , as we vary the los matrix the output power is not held fixed .",

    "<S> the dependence of the gaussian input information rate on the line - of - sight ( los ) matrix in multiple - input multiple - output coherent rician fading channels is explored . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that the outage probability and the mutual information induced by a multivariate circularly symmetric gaussian input with any covariance matrix are monotonic in the los matrix @xmath0 , or more precisely , monotonic in @xmath1 in the sense of the loewner partial order . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , it is also demonstrated that this ordering on the los matrices is a necessary condition for the uniform monotonicity over all input covariance matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this result is subsequently applied to prove the monotonicity of the isotropic gaussian input information rate and channel capacity in the singular values of the los matrix . </S>",
    "<S> extensions to multiple - access channels are also discussed . </S>"
