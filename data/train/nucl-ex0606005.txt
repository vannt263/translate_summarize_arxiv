    "the features of high @xmath9  hadron production at rhic suggest the creation of a new state of matter  @xcite@xcite . while nuclear modification factors smaller than one at high @xmath9  are interpreted as a sign for energy loss of high momentum partons in a dense strongly interacting medium , the measured high values in baryon / meson ratios can be explained by hadron production via quark coalescence . studying these effects at the sps can help to enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms . the presented results at the highest sps beam energy of 158@xmath0 gev ( @xmath10 ) exhibit similar trends as previously seen in rhic data .",

    "neutral strange hadrons are identified by a reconstruction of the decay topologies @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( 63.9% ) .",
    "candidates for these decays are selected by geometrical and kinematical criteria and their invariant mass is calculated to extract yields in @xmath19-bins . here , the centrality interval ( 023.5)% and the range @xmath20 around midrapidity were used .",
    "all results are corrected for acceptance and reconstruction inefficiency .",
    "the @xmath11 , proton and pion yields have not yet been corrected for feeddown from the decay of heavier particles , but the bias has been estimated to be below 10% .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath2  is defined as the yield ratio in central over peripheral collisions , scaled by the mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath21 : @xmath22 @xmath21 was calculated for each centrality interval using the venus model .",
