    "in the foregoing we have obtained simple asymptotic expressions for the polarization tensor of graphene and reflection coefficients at nonzero matsubara frequencies suitable for calculation of the casimir free energy and pressure between two parallel graphene sheets . this has been made possible by applying the new form of the polarization tensor @xcite valid not only at the imaginary matsubara frequencies , but over the entire plane of complex frequency . in this paper ,",
    "the analytic asymptotic expressions are derived by means of perturbation expressions in powers of a natural parameter which becomes small over the wide range of physically interesting separations and temperatures .",
    "the respective expressions for the casimir free energy and pressure between two graphene sheets take into account both an explicit dependence of the polarization tensor ( or , equivalently , conductivity , or dielectric permittivity , or density - density correlation function ) on the temperature as a parameter and an implicit temperature dependence through a summation over the matsubara frequencies .    using the obtained asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients , we have compared the casimir free energy and pressure calculated in the framework of our formalism with the previously known ones @xcite calculated numerically using the polarization tensor of ref .",
    "it was shown that our asymptotic approach leads to very accurate results ( the maximum errors are equal to 0.17% and 0.18% at the separation of 5 nm for the casimir free energy and pressure , respectively ) .",
    "these errors decrease with increase of separation . at all separations above 35 nm the asymptotic casimir free energies and pressures coincide with the exact ones .",
    "we have investigated an origin of large thermal effect arising in the casimir interaction between graphene sheets at short separations @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the total thermal corrections to the casimir energy and pressure at zero temperature consist of two parts .",
    "the explicit part is determined by the parametric dependence of the polarization tensor on @xmath3 , whereas the implicit one arises through a summation over the matsubara frequencies . according to our results , in both the casimir free energy and pressure , an explicit thermal effect exceeds an implicit one at shorter separations . at moderate separations both parts of the thermal effect",
    "are similar in magnitudes . with further increase of separation an implicit thermal effect in",
    "the casimir free energy and pressure becomes larger than an explicit one .",
    "we have also confirmed the previously known result @xcite that the thermal effect in the casimir interaction between two graphene sheets contributes more than 80% of the casimir free energy and pressure at relatively short separations exceeding 100 and 150 nm , respectively , and that the major contribution to both the free energy and pressure is given by the electromagnetic field with transverse magnetic polarization .    in future",
    "it would be interesting to extend our asymptotic approach to real frequency axis and obtain simple analytic expressions for the polarization tensor , conductivity , density - density correlation functions and dielectric permittivity of graphene at nonzero temperature for numerous applications other than the casimir effect .",
    "as an example , one could mention calculation of the reflectivity properties of graphene over a wide range of real frequencies .",
