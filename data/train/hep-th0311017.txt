    "the last seven years have been a very exciting time for string theory .",
    "a  new understanding of nonperturbative objects in string theory , such as d - branes , has led to exciting new developments that relate string theory to physical systems such as black holes and supersymmetric gauge field theories .",
    "it has also led to the discovery of unexpected relationships between yang - mills theories and quantum theories of gravity such as closed superstring theories and m - theory .",
    "finally , the analysis of unstable d - branes has elucidated the long - standing mysteries associated with the open string tachyon .",
    "the study of unstable d - branes and tachyons has also led to the realization that string field theory contains significant non - perturbative information .",
    "this has been somewhat of a surprise .",
    "certain forms of string field theory were known since the early 1990 s , but there was no concrete evidence that they could be used to give a non - perturbative definition of string theory .",
    "the study of tachyon condensation , however , has changed our perspective .",
    "these lecture notes give an introduction to string field theory and review recent work in which unstable d - branes and their associated tachyons are described using string field theory . as we will discuss here",
    ", this work suggests that open string field theory , or some successor of it , may give a complete definition of string theory in which all possible backgrounds can be obtained from a single set of degrees of freedom .",
    "such a formulation appears to be necessary to address questions related to vacuum selection and string cosmology .",
    "in the rest of this section we will review briefly the current status of string theory as a whole , and summarize the goals of this set of lectures . in section  [ sec : d - branes ] we review some basic aspects of d - branes . in section  [ sec : tachyon - d - branes ] , we describe a particular d - brane configuration which exhibits a tachyonic instability .",
    "this tachyon can be seen in the low - energy yang - mills description of the d - brane system .",
    "we also describe a set of conjectures made by sen in 1999 , which stated that the tachyonic instability of the open bosonic string is the instability of the space - filling d25-brane .",
    "sen suggested that open string field theory could be used to give an analytic description of this instability . in section",
    "[ sec : sft ] we give an introduction to witten s bosonic open string field theory ( osft ) .",
    "section  [ sec : cft ] gives a more detailed analytic description of this theory using the language of conformal field theory .",
    "section  [ sec : overlaps ] describes the string field theory using the oscillator approach and overlap integrals .",
    "the two approaches to osft described in these two sections give complementary ways of analyzing problems in string field theory . in section 7",
    "we summarize evidence from string field theory for sen s conjectures . in section 8",
    "we describe `` vacuum string field theory , '' a new version of open string field theory which arises when one attempts to directly formulate the theory around the classically stable vacuum where the d - brane has disappeared .",
    "this section also discusses important structures in string field theory , such as projectors of the star algebra of open string fields .",
    "section 9 contains concluding remarks .",
    "much new work has been done in this area since these lectures were presented at tasi in 2001 . except for some references to more recent developments which are related to the topics covered ,",
    "these lecture notes primarily cover work done before summer of 2001 .",
    "previous articles reviewing related work include those of ohmori  @xcite , de smet  @xcite , arefeva _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , bonora _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and taylor  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of major related areas which we do not cover significantly or at all in these lectures .",
    "we do not have any substantial discussion on the dynamic process of tachyon decay ; there has been quite a bit of work on this subject  @xcite since the time of these lectures in 2001 .",
    "we do not discuss the moyal approach to sft taken recently by bars and collaborators  @xcite ; this work is an interesting alternative to the level - truncation method primarily used here .",
    "we also do not discuss in any detail the alternative boundary string field theory ( bsft ) approach to osft .",
    "the bsft approach is well suited to derive certain concrete results regarding the tachyon vacuum  @xcite  for example , using this approach the energy of the tachyon vacuum can be computed exactly . on the other hand ,",
    "bsft is not a completely well - defined framework , as massive string fields can not yet be consistently incorporated into the theory .      to understand the significance of developments over the last seven years , it is useful to recall the status of string theory in early 1995 . at that time",
    "it was clearly understood that there were five distinct ways in which a supersymmetric string could be quantized to give a microscopic definition of a theory of quantum gravity in ten dimensions .",
    "each of these quantum string theories gives a set of rules for calculating scattering amplitudes of string states ; these states describe gravitational quanta and other massless and massive particles moving in a ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the five superstring theories are known as the type iia , iib , i , heterotic @xmath0 , and heterotic @xmath1 theories .",
    "while these string theories give perturbative descriptions of quantum gravity , there was little understanding in 1995 of nonperturbative aspects of these theories .    in the years between 1995 and 2002 ,",
    "several new ideas dramatically transformed our understanding of string theory .",
    "we now briefly summarize these ideas and mention some aspects of these developments relevant to the main topic of these lectures .",
    "* dualities : * the five different perturbative formulations of superstring theory are all related to one another through duality symmetries  @xcite , whereby the degrees of freedom in one theory can be described through a duality transformation in terms of the degrees of freedom of another theory .",
    "some of these duality symmetries are nonperturbative , in the sense that the string coupling @xmath2 in one theory is related to the inverse string coupling @xmath3 in the dual theory .",
    "the web of dualities that relate the different theories gives a picture in which , rather than describing five distinct fundamental theories , each superstring theory appears to be a particular perturbative limit of a single , still unknown , underlying theoretical structure .",
    "* m - theory : * in addition to the five perturbative string theories , the web of dualities also seems to include a limit which describes a quantum theory of gravity in eleven dimensions .",
    "this new theory has been dubbed `` m - theory '' .",
    "although no covariant definition for m - theory has been given , this theory can be related to type iia and heterotic @xmath1 string theories through compactification on a circle @xmath4 and the space @xmath5 , respectively  @xcite . in the relation",
    "to type iia , for example , the compactification radius @xmath6 of m - theory is equal to the product @xmath7 of the string coupling @xmath8 and the string length @xmath9 .",
    "thus , m - theory in flat space , which arises in the limit @xmath10 , can be thought of as the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory .",
    "the field theory limit of m - theory is eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "it is also suspected that m - theory may be formulated as a quantum theory of membranes in eleven dimensions  @xcite .",
    "* branes : * in addition to strings , all five superstring theories , as well as m - theory , contain extended objects of various dimensionalities known as `` branes '' .",
    "m - theory has m2-branes and m5-branes , which have two and five dimensions of spatial extent , respectively .",
    "( a string is a one - brane , since it has one spatial dimension . )",
    "the different superstring theories each have different sets of ( stable ) d - branes , special branes that are defined by dirichlet - type boundary conditions on strings .",
    "in particular , the iia / iib superstring theories contain ( stable ) d - branes of all even / odd dimensions .",
    "each superstring theory also has a fundamental string and a neveu - schwarz five - brane .",
    "the branes of one theory can be related to the branes of another through the duality transformations mentioned above . using an appropriate sequence of dualities",
    ", any brane can be mapped to any other brane , including the string itself .",
    "this suggests that none of these objects are really any more fundamental than any others ; this idea is known as `` brane democracy '' .    *",
    "m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft : * it is a remarkable consequence of the above developments that for certain asymptotic space - time backgrounds , m - theory and string theory can be completely described through supersymmetric quantum mechanics and field theories related to the low - energy description of systems of branes .",
    "the m(atrix ) model of m - theory is a simple supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics , and it is believed to capture ( in light - cone coordinates ) all of the physics of m - theory in asymptotically flat spacetime . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , certain maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theories can be used to describe closed superstring theories in asymptotic spacetime backgrounds that are the product of anti - de sitter space and a sphere .",
    "it is believed that the yang - mills theories and the matrix model of m - theory , each give true nonperturbative descriptions of quantum gravity in the corresponding spacetime geometry . for reviews of m(atrix )",
    "theory and ads / cft , see taylor  @xcite and aharony_et.al _  @xcite .",
    "* unstable d - branes and open string tachyons : * this is in large part the subject of these lectures . the most recent chapter in our new understanding of nonperturbative effects in string theory has been the incorporation of unstable branes and open string tachyons into the overall framework of the theory .",
    "it has turned out that an understanding of unstable d - branes is necessary to properly describe all d - branes .",
    "this is natural from the point of view of k - theory , where brane configurations which are equivalent under the annihilation of unstable branes are identified  @xcite .",
    "the long - mysterious tachyon instability of open string theory has finally been given a physical interpretation : it is the instability of the d - brane that supports the existence of open strings .",
    "the instability disappears in the tachyon vacuum , in which the d - brane decays .",
    "moreover , the belief that d - branes are solitonic solutions of string theory has been confirmed : starting with the appropriate tachyonic field theory of unstable space - filling branes , one can describe lower dimensional d - branes as solitonic solutions .",
    "lower dimensional d - branes are thereby essentially obtained as solitons of the tachyon field theory , so , in some sense , lower - dimensional d - branes can be thought of as being made of tachyons ! it has also been shown that the physics of unstable d - branes is captured by string field theory , thus making it a candidate for a non - perturbative formulation of string theory capable of describing changes of the string background .",
    "the set of ideas just summarized have greatly increased our understanding of nonperturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "in particular m(atrix ) theory and the ads / cft correspondences provide nonperturbative definitions of m - theory and string theory in certain asymptotic space - time backgrounds which can be used , in principle , to calculate any local result in quantum gravity . through string field theory",
    "we have a possibly nonperturbative definition of the theory that appears to capture many open string theory backgrounds .",
    "the existing formulations of string field theory are not manifestly background independent because a background must be selected to write the theory .",
    "nevertheless , as we discuss in these lectures , the theory describes multiple distinct backgrounds in terms of a common set of variables , so it embodies , at least partially , physical background independence .",
    "it remains to be seen if the theory incorporates full physical background independence ; this requires an ability to describe all possible open string backgrounds , as well as all possible closed string backgrounds .",
    "the goal of these lectures is to describe progress towards a nonperturbative formulation of string theory that implements the physics of background independence .",
    "open string field theory , as applied to tachyon condensation and related matters , has shown itself capable of describing non - perturbative objects in string theory , and it has demonstrated an ability to represent various open string backgrounds .    a completely background independent formulation of string theory may be needed to address fundamental questions such as : what is string theory / m - theory ?",
    "how is the vacuum of string theory selected ? ( _ i.e. _ , why can the observable low - energy universe be accurately described by the standard model of particle physics in four space - time dimensions with an apparently small but nonzero positive cosmological constant ? ) , and other questions of a cosmological nature .",
    "obviously , aspiring to address these questions is an ambitious undertaking , but we believe that attaining a better understanding of string field theory is a useful step in this direction . more concretely ,",
    "in these lectures we will describe recent progress on open string field theory .",
    "it may be useful here to recall some basic aspects of open and closed strings and the relationship between them .",
    "closed strings , which are topologically equivalent to a circle @xmath4 , give rise upon quantization to a massless set of states associated with the graviton @xmath11 , the dilaton @xmath12 , and the antisymmetric two - form @xmath13 , as well as an infinite family of massive states . for the supersymmetric",
    "closed string , further massless fields appear within the graviton supermultiplet ",
    "these are the ramond - ramond @xmath14-form fields @xmath15 and the gravitini @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the quantum theory of closed strings is naturally associated with a theory of gravity in space - time . on the other hand , open strings , which are topologically equivalent to an interval",
    "@xmath17 $ ] , give rise under quantization to a massless gauge field @xmath18 in space - time .",
    "the supersymmetric open string also has a massless gaugino field @xmath19 .",
    "it is now understood that the endpoints of open strings must lie on a dirichlet @xmath14-brane ( d@xmath14-brane ) , and that the massless open string fields describe the fluctuations of the d - brane and the gauge field living on the world - volume of the d - brane .",
    "it may seem , therefore , that open and closed strings are quite distinct , and describe disjoint aspects of the physics in a fixed background space - time that contains some family of d - branes . at tree level ,",
    "the closed strings indeed describe gravitational physics in the bulk space - time , while the open strings describe the d - brane dynamics . at the quantum level , however , the physics of open and closed strings are deeply connected .",
    "indeed , historically open strings were discovered first through the form of their scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "looking at one - loop processes for open strings led to the first discovery of closed strings , which appeared as _",
    "poles _ in nonplanar one - loop open string diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the fact that open string diagrams naturally contain closed string intermediate states indicates that in some sense all closed string interactions are implicitly defined by the open string diagrams .",
    "this connection underlies many of the important recent developments in string theory .",
    "in particular , the m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft correspondences between gauge theories and quantum gravity are essentially limits in which closed string physics in a fixed space - time background is captured by the yang - mills limit of an open string theory on a family of branes ( d0-branes for m(atrix ) theory , d3-branes for the cft that describes ads@xmath20 , etc . )    since quantum gravity theories in certain fixed space - time backgrounds can be described by field theory limits of open strings , we may ask if a global change of the space - time background can be described as well . if m(atrix ) theory or ads / cft allowed for this description",
    ", it would indicate that these models may have background - independent generalizations .",
    "unfortunately , such background changes involve the generally intractable addition of an infinite number of nonrenormalizable interactions to the field theories in question .",
    "one tractable situation arises for the addition of a constant background @xmath21 field in space - time ( perhaps because this closed string background is gauge equivalent to the open string background of a d - brane with a magnetic field ) . in the associated yang - mills theory ,",
    "this change in the background field corresponds to replacing products of open string fields with a noncommutative star - product .",
    "the resulting theory is a noncommutative yang - mills theory .",
    "such noncommutative theories are the only well - understood example of a situation where adding an infinite number of apparently nonrenormalizable terms to a field theory action leads to a sensible modification of quantum field theory ( for a review of noncommutative field theory and its connection to string theory , see douglas and nekrasov  @xcite ) .",
    "string field theory is a nonperturbative formulation of string theory in which the infinite family of fields associated with string excitations are described by a space - time field theory action . for open strings on a d - brane configuration ,",
    "this field theory contains yang - mills fields and an entire hierarchy of massive string fields .",
    "integrating out all the massive fields from the string field theory action gives rise to a nonabelian born - infeld action for the d - branes , which includes an infinite set of higher - order terms that arise from string theory corrections to the simple yang - mills action . like the case of noncommutative field theory discussed above , the new terms appearing in this action are apparently nonrenormalizable , but the combination of terms must work together to form a sensible theory .    in the 1980 s , a great deal of work",
    "was done to formulate string field theory for open and closed , bosonic and supersymmetric string theories .",
    "all of this work was based on the brst approach to string quantization  @xcite . for the open bosonic string witten  @xcite constructed an extremely elegant string field theory based on the chern - simons action . this cubic open string field theory ( osft )",
    "is the primary focus of the work described in these lectures .",
    "although this theory can be described in a simple abstract language , practical computations rapidly become complicated .",
    "the formulation of bosonic closed string field theory was completed in the early 1990s  @xcite .",
    "this theory is the natural counterpart of witten s open string field theory , but it is more technically challenging because of its nonpolynomiality .",
    "a nonpolynomial string field theory is also required to describe in a non - singular fashion open and closed string fields  @xcite . for open superstrings ,",
    "a cubic formulation  @xcite encountered some difficulties  @xcite ( for which there are some proposed resolutions  @xcite ) , but the nonpolynomial formulation of berkovits  @xcite appears to be fully consistent . despite a substantial amount of work in string field theory in the early 90 s ,",
    "little insight was gained at the time concerning non - perturbative physics .",
    "work on this subject stalled out until open string field theory was used to test the tachyon conjectures beginning in 1999  @xcite .    one simple feature of the 26-dimensional bosonic string has been problematic since the early days of string theory : both the open and closed bosonic strings have tachyons in their spectra , indicating that the usual perturbative vacua of these theories are unstable . in 1999 , ashoke sen had a remarkable insight into the nature of the open bosonic string tachyon  @xcite .",
    "he observed that the open bosonic string theory ( the so - called veneziano model ) represents open strings that end on a space - filling d25-brane .",
    "he pointed out that this d - brane is unstable , as it does not carry any conserved charge , and he suggested that the open string tachyon is in fact the unstable mode of the d25-brane .",
    "this led him to conjecture that open string field theory could be used to precisely determine a new vacuum for the open string , namely one in which the d25-brane is annihilated through condensation of the tachyonic unstable mode .",
    "sen made several precise conjectures regarding the details of the string field theory description of this new open string vacuum .",
    "as we describe in these lectures , there is now overwhelming evidence that sen s picture is correct , demonstrating that string field theory accurately describes the nonperturbative physics of d - branes .",
    "this new nonperturbative application of string field theory has sparked a new wave of work on open string field theory , revealing many remarkable new structures .",
    "in particular , string field theory now provides a concrete framework in which disconnected string backgrounds can emerge from the equations of motion of a single underlying theory .",
    "although so far this can only be shown explicitly in the open string context , this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of background - independence in quantum theories of gravity .",
    "in this section we briefly review some basic features of d - branes .",
    "the concepts developed here will be useful to describe tachyonic d - brane configurations in the following section . for more detailed reviews of d - branes , see the reviews of polchinski  @xcite , and of taylor  @xcite .",
    "d - branes can be understood from many points of view . in these lectures we primarily focus on the viewpoint motivated by the recent work on tachyon condensation , which is that that d - branes are solitons in string field theory .",
    "the original realization of the importance of d - branes in string theory stemmed from polchinski s realization that d - branes could be described in two complementary fashions : _ a _ ) as extended extremal black brane solutions of supergravity that carry conserved charges , and _",
    "b _ ) as hypersurfaces on which strings have dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we now discuss these two viewpoints briefly .    _",
    "a _ ) the ten - dimensional type iia and iib supergravity theories each have a set of @xmath22-form fields @xmath23 in the supergraviton multiplet , with @xmath14 even / odd for type iia / iib supergravity .",
    "these are the ramond - ramond ( rr ) fields in the massless superstring spectrum . for each of these @xmath22-form fields ,",
    "there is a solution of the supergravity field equations that is invariant under @xmath22-dimensional lorentz transformations , and which has the form of an extremal black hole solution in the @xmath24 spatial directions that are not affected by these lorentz transformations  @xcite .",
    "these `` black @xmath14-brane '' solutions carry charge under the rr fields @xmath25 , and are bps states in the supergravity theory that preserve half the supersymmetry of the theory .",
    "these solutions represent the gravitational and gauge backgrounds created by the branes , in a way similar to that in which the schwarzschild solution represents the gravitational background of a point mass , or the coulomb field represents the electric field of a point charge .    _ b _ ) in type iia and iib string theory , it is possible to consider open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions on some number @xmath24 of the spatial coordinates @xmath26 .",
    "the locus of points defined by such dirichlet boundary conditions defines a @xmath22-dimensional hypersurface @xmath27 in the ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "when @xmath14 is even / odd in type iia / iib string theory , the spectrum of the resulting quantum open string theory contains a massless set of fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these fields can be associated with a gauge field living on the hypersurface @xmath27 , and a set of degrees of freedom describing the transverse fluctuations of this hypersurface in spacetime , respectively .",
    "thus , the quantum fluctuations of the open string describe a fluctuating @xmath22-dimensional hypersurface in spacetime  a dirichlet - brane , or `` d - brane '' .    the remarkable insight of polchinski  @xcite in 1995 was the observation that the stable dirichlet - branes of superstring theory carry ramond - ramond charges , and therefore should be described in the low - energy supergravity limit of string theory by precisely the black @xmath14-branes discussed in _ a _ ) .",
    "this connection between the string and supergravity descriptions of these nonperturbative objects paved the way to a dramatic series of new developments in string theory , including connections between string theory and supersymmetric gauge theories , string constructions of black holes , and new approaches to string phenomenology .",
    "the bosonic d - branes on which we concentrate attention in these lectures do not carry conserved charges , and thus are not associated with supergravity solutions as in _ a ) _ ; rather , these d - branes can be described through open bosonic strings with some dirichlet boundary conditions as in _",
    "b)_.      in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the low - energy super yang - mills description of the dynamics of one or more d - branes .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , the massless open string modes on a d@xmath14-brane in type iia or iib superstring theory describe a @xmath30-component gauge field @xmath31 , @xmath24 transverse scalar fields @xmath32 , and a set of massless fermionic gaugino fields .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath32 describe small fluctuations of the d - brane around a flat hypersurface .",
    "if the d - brane geometry is sufficiently far from flat , it is useful to describe the d - brane configuration by a general embedding @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are @xmath35 coordinates on the d@xmath14-brane world - volume @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are ten functions giving a map from @xmath36 into the space - time manifold @xmath38 . just as the einstein equations which govern the geometry of spacetime arise from the condition that the one - loop contribution to the closed string beta function vanishes , a set of equations of motion for a general d@xmath14-brane geometry and associated world - volume gauge field can be derived from a calculation of the one - loop open string beta function  @xcite .",
    "these equations of motion arise from the classical born - infeld action : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath12 are the pullbacks of the ten - dimensional metric , antisymmetric tensor , and dilaton to the d - brane world - volume , while @xmath42 is the field strength of the world - volume @xmath43 gauge field @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 represents a set of chern - simons terms which will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "this action can be verified by a perturbative string calculation  @xcite , which also gives a precise expression for the brane tension @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the closed string coupling , equal to the exponential of the dilaton expectation value .",
    "a particular limit of the born - infeld action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) is useful to describe many low - energy aspects of d - brane dynamics .",
    "take the background space - time @xmath48 to be flat , and all other supergravity fields ( @xmath49 ) to vanish .",
    "we then assume that the d - brane is approximately flat , and is close to the hypersurface @xmath50 , so that we may make the static gauge choice @xmath51 .",
    "we furthermore take the low - energy limit in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 are small and of the same order .",
    "the action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) can then be expanded as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath14-brane world - volume and the coupling @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 ignoring fermionic terms , the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ eq : action - expansion ] ) is simply the reduction to @xmath22 dimensions of the ten - dimensional @xmath58 super yang - mills action : @xmath59 where for @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the world - volume @xmath43 field strength , and for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .    when multiple d@xmath14-branes are present , the d - brane action is modified in a fairly simple fashion  @xcite .",
    "consider a system of @xmath64 coincident d - branes .",
    "for every pair of branes @xmath65 there is a set of massless fields @xmath66 associated with strings stretching from the @xmath67th brane to the @xmath68th brane ; the indices @xmath69 are known as chan - paton indices . treating the fields ( [ eq : nonabelian - fields ] ) as @xmath64-by-@xmath64 matrices , and letting tr denote the trace operation for such matrices , the multiple brane analogue of the born - infeld action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) takes the schematic form @xmath70 in order to properly define this nonabelian analog of the born - infeld action ( nbi ) , it is necessary to resolve the ordering ambiguities in ( [ eq : nbi ] ) .",
    "since the spacetime coordinates @xmath32 associated with the d - brane positions in space - time become themselves matrix - valued , even evaluating the pullbacks @xmath71 involves resolving ordering issues .",
    "much work has been done recently to resolve these ordering ambiguities  @xcite but there is still no known definition of the nonabelian born - infeld theory ( [ eq : nbi ] ) which is valid to all orders .",
    "the nonabelian born - infeld action ( [ eq : nbi ] ) becomes much simpler when , once again , the background space - time is assumed to be flat and we take the low - energy limit , leading to the nonabelian @xmath72 super yang - mills action in @xmath73 dimensions .",
    "this action is the reduction to @xmath35 dimensions of the ten - dimensional @xmath72 super yang - mills action ( analogous to ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) ) . in this reduction , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the world - volume @xmath72 field strength , and for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where now @xmath76 and @xmath61 are @xmath77 matrices . since the derivatives @xmath78 are set to zero in the dimensional reduction , we furthermore have , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 $ ] .    the low - energy description of a system of @xmath64 coincident flat d - branes is thus given by @xmath72 super yang - mills theory in the appropriate dimension .",
    "this connection between d - brane actions in string theory and super yang - mills theory has led to many new developments , including new insights into supersymmetric field theories , the m(atrix ) theory and ads / cft correspondences , and brane world scenarios .      in this subsection",
    "we describe a remarkable feature of d - brane systems : one or more d - branes of a fixed dimension can be used to construct additional d - branes of higher or lower dimension .    in our discussion of the d - brane action ( [ eq : dbi ] ) , we mentioned a group of terms @xmath45 which we did not describe explicitly . for a single d@xmath14-brane ,",
    "these chern - simons terms can be combined into a single expression of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents a formal sum over all the ramond - ramond fields @xmath83 of various dimensions . in this",
    "integral , for each term @xmath83 , the nonvanishing contribution to ( [ eq : chern - simons ] ) is given by expanding the exponential of @xmath84 to order @xmath85 , where the dimension of the resulting form saturates the dimension of the brane .",
    "for example , on a d@xmath14-brane , there is a coupling of the form @xmath86 this coupling implies that the @xmath43 field strength on the d@xmath14-brane couples to the rr field associated with @xmath87-branes .",
    "thus , we can associate magnetic fields on a d@xmath14-brane with dissolved @xmath87-branes living on the d@xmath14-brane .",
    "this result generalizes to a system of multiple d@xmath14-branes , in which case a trace is included on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : chern - simons ] ) .",
    "for example , on @xmath64 compact d@xmath14-branes wrapped on a @xmath14-torus , the flux @xmath88 of the magnetic field over a two - cycle on the torus is quantized and measures the number of units of d@xmath87-brane charge on the d@xmath14-branes that threads the cycle integrated over .",
    "thus , these branes are encoded in the field strength @xmath61 . the object in ( [ eq : p-2-charge ] ) is the relevant component of the first chern class of the @xmath72 bundle described by the gauge field on the @xmath64 branes .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 encodes d@xmath90-brane charge on the d@xmath14-branes , etc ..    just as lower - dimensional branes can be described in terms of the degrees of freedom associated with a system of @xmath64 d@xmath14-branes through the field strength @xmath61 , higher - dimensional branes can be described by a system of @xmath64 d@xmath14-branes in terms of the commutators of the matrix - valued scalar fields @xmath32 . just as @xmath91 measures @xmath87-brane charge , the matrix @xmath92 \\label{eq : up - charge}\\ ] ] measures @xmath93-brane charge  @xcite .",
    "the charge ( [ eq : up - charge ] ) should be interpreted as a form of local charge density . just as the @xmath64 positions of the d@xmath14-branes are replaced by matrices in the nonabelian theory ,",
    "so the locations of the charges become matrix - valued .",
    "the trace of ( [ eq : up - charge ] ) vanishes for finite sized matrices because the net d@xmath14-brane charge of a finite - size brane configuration in flat spacetime vanishes .",
    "higher multipole moments of the brane charge , however , have a natural definition in terms of traces of the charge matrix multiplied by powers of the scalars @xmath32 , and generically are nonvanishing .    a simple example of the mechanism by which a system of multiple d@xmath14-branes form a higher - dimensional brane is given by the matrix sphere .",
    "if we take a system of d0-branes with scalar matrices @xmath32 given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the generators of @xmath96 in the @xmath64-dimensional representation , then we have a configuration corresponding to the `` matrix sphere '' .",
    "this is a d2-brane of spherical geometry living on the locus of points satisfying @xmath97 .",
    "the `` local '' d2-brane charge of this brane is given by ( [ eq : up - charge ] ) ; here , for example , the d2-brane charge in the @xmath98-@xmath99 plane is proportional to the matrix @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , as one would expect from the geometry of a spherical brane . the d2-brane configuration given by ( [ eq : matrix - sphere ] ) is rotationally invariant ( up to a gauge transformation ) .",
    "the restriction of the brane to the desired locus of points can be seen from the relation @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude our discussion of d - branes with a brief description of t - duality .",
    "t - duality is a perturbative and nonperturbative symmetry which relates the type iia and type iib string theories .",
    "this duality symmetry was in fact crucial in the original discovery of d - branes  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of t - duality can be found in the textbook by polchinski  @xcite . using t - duality",
    ", we construct an explicit example of a brane within a brane encoded in super yang - mills theory , illustrating the ideas of the previous subsection . this example will be used in the following section to construct an analogous configuration with a tachyon .    consider type iia string theory on a spacetime of the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is",
    "a generic 9-manifold of lorentz signature , and @xmath4 is a circle of radius @xmath105 .",
    "t - duality is the statement that this theory is precisely equivalent , even at the perturbative level , to type iib string theory on the spacetime @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a circle of radius @xmath108 .",
    "t - duality symmetry is most easily understood in the case of closed strings , where it amounts to an exchange of winding and momentum modes of the string .",
    "the string winding modes on @xmath4 have energy @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the winding number .",
    "the t - dual momentum modes on @xmath107 have energy @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the momentum quantum number .",
    "these two sets of values coincide when @xmath110 and @xmath112 run over all possible integers .",
    "it is in fact straightforward to check that the full spectrum of closed string states is unchanged under t - duality . for the case of open strings , t - duality maps an open string with neumann boundary conditions on @xmath4 to an open string with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath107 , and",
    "vice versa .",
    "thus , a d@xmath14-brane which is wrapped around the circle @xmath4 is mapped under t - duality to a d@xmath113-brane which is localized to a point on the circle @xmath107 . under t - duality the low - energy @xmath22-dimensional yang - mills theory on the @xmath14-brane is replaced by a @xmath14-dimensional yang - mills theory on the dual @xmath113-brane .",
    "mathematically , the covariant derivative operator in the direction @xmath4 is replaced under t - duality with an adjoint scalar field @xmath32 .",
    "formally , this adjoint scalar field is an infinite size matrix  @xcite , which contains information about the open strings wrapped an arbitrary number of times around the compact direction @xmath107 .",
    "we can summarize the relevant mappings under t - duality in the following table    [ cols=\">,^ , > \" , ]     these results were rather surprising , indicating that while the energy monotonically approaches @xmath114 up to level 12 , at level ( 14 , 42 ) the energy drops below @xmath114 , and that the energy continues to decrease , reaching @xmath115 at level ( 18 , 54 ) .",
    "we will discuss the resolution of this unexpected overshoot shortly .",
    "first , however , it is interesting to consider the tachyon condensation problem from the point of view of the effective tachyon potential .",
    "if instead of trying to solve the quadratic equations for all @xmath64 of the fields appearing in ( [ eq : scalar - potential ] ) , we instead fix the tachyon field @xmath116 and solve the quadratic equations for the remaining @xmath117 fields , we can determine a effective potential @xmath118 for the tachyon field .",
    "this has been done numerically up to level ( 16 , 48 )  @xcite . at each level , the tachyon effective potential smoothly interpolates between the perturbative vacuum and the nonperturbative vacuum near @xmath119 .",
    "for example , the tachyon effective potential at level ( 2 , 6 ) is graphed in figure  [ f : potential ] . in all level truncations other than ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 2 , 4 ) ( at least up to level ( 10 , 20 ) ) , the tachyon effective potential has two branch point singularities at which the continuous solution for the other fields breaks down ; for the level ( 2 , 6 ) truncation , these branch points occur at @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; the lower branch point is denoted by a solid circle in figure  [ f : potential ] . as a result of these branch points ,",
    "the tachyon effective potential is only valid for a finite range of @xmath116 , ranging between approximately @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in section [ sec :",
    "gauge ] we review results which indicate that these branch points arise because the trajectory in field space associated with this potential encounters the boundary of the region of feynman - siegel gauge validity .",
    "it seems almost to be a fortunate accident that the nonperturbative vacuum lies within the region of validity of this gauge choice .",
    "it is worth mentioning again here that in the bsft approach , the tachyon potential can be computed exactly  @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", there is no branch point in the effective potential , which is unbounded below for negative values of the tachyon . on the other hand ,",
    "the nontrivial vacuum in the background - independent approach arises only as the tachyon field goes to infinity , so it is harder to study the physics of the stable vacuum from this point of view .",
    "another interesting perspective on the tachyon effective potential is found by performing a perturbative ( but off - shell ) computation of the coefficients in the tachyon effective potential in the level - truncated theory .",
    "this gives a power series expansion of the effective potential @xmath124 the coefficients up to @xmath125 have been computed in the level truncations up to ( 10 , 20 )  @xcite . because of the branch point singularity near @xmath126 , this series has a radius of convergence much smaller than the value of @xmath116 at the nonperturbative vacuum .",
    "thus , the energy at the stable vacuum lies outside the naive range of the potential defined by the perturbative expansion .",
    "now , let us return to the problem of the overshoot in energy below @xmath114 found at level 14 by gaiotto and rastelli .",
    "the most straightforward way of determining whether or not this represents a real problem for string field theory would be to simply continue the calculation to higher levels .",
    "unfortunately , at present this is not tractable , as the difficulty of computation grows exponentially in the level .",
    "thus , we must resort to more indirect methods .",
    "it was found empirically by taylor  @xcite that the level @xmath127 approximations of string field theory give on - shell and off - shell amplitudes with error of order @xmath128 .",
    "this work and further evidence  @xcite indicates that amplitudes can be very accurately approximated by computing them in different level @xmath127 truncations , and matching to a power series in @xmath128 .",
    "such an approach can be taken to determine highly accurate values for the coefficients @xmath129 in ( [ eq : v ] ) . as noted above",
    ", the resulting power series has a finite radius of convergence , and the stable vacuum lies beyond this limit .",
    "there is a standard technique , however , known as the method of pad approximants , which allows one to extrapolate a function beyond its naive radius of convergence , if the function is sufficiently well - behaved in the direction in which it is extrapolated .",
    "the idea of pad approximants is to replace a power series having given coefficients for a fixed number of terms with a rational function with the same number of coefficients , choosing the coefficients of the rational function to give a power series which agrees with the fixed coefficients in the original power series .",
    "for example , consider the first three terms in the level @xmath130 approximation to the tachyon effective potential ( [ eq : v ] ) , @xmath131 this truncated expansion has no local minima , while the pad approximant @xmath132 does ; this approximant thus represents a better description of the tachyon potential than the truncated expression ( [ eq : truncated ] ) .",
    "the advantage of pad approximants is that they allow one to incorporate poles into approximations of a function with a desired local power series behavior . for a wide class of functions ,",
    "successive pad approximants converge exponentially quickly in the region where the function is smooth .",
    "empirically , this seems to be the case for the tachyon effective potential .",
    "thus , the energy minimum at any finite level of truncation can be determined to an arbitrary degree of accuracy from the leading coefficients in the potential .",
    "for example , the energy can be computed to 10 digits of accuracy by including approximately 40 coefficients @xmath129 ; this calculation is , however , highly sensitive to the accuracy of the coefficients  @xcite .",
    "combining pad approximants with approximations to the coefficients @xmath129 , computed by matching level - truncated results in a @xmath128 expansion , it is possible to predict not only the exact value of the energy at the stable minimum as @xmath133 , but also to predict the values of the approximate energy at intermediate values of @xmath127 .",
    "such a computation was performed using the level approximated values of @xmath129 up to level @xmath134  @xcite . by first using these values to predict the level - approximated values at higher levels , and then inserting these values into pad approximants ,",
    "the overshoot phenomenon found by gaiotto and rastelli was accurately reproduced .",
    "for example , compared to the value -1.0003678 found by these authors at level ( 16 , 32 ) , extrapolation from results at levels @xmath135 up to ( 10 , 20 ) gives a predicted value of -1.0003773 at level ( 16 , 32 ) .",
    "furthermore , the extrapolated values @xmath136 of the energy at the stable minimum were found to decrease up to approximately level 26 , and then to increase , approaching an asymptotic value as @xmath133 of @xmath137 with error @xmath138 .",
    "these results suggested that the energy at the minimum in the level - truncated theory takes the form shown in figure  [ f : e - l ] .",
    "= 12 cm    in the calculation just described , there were two sources of error : 1 ) the coefficients @xmath129 had some numerical inaccuracy , and 2 ) there is some error introduced in extrapolating from low levels of truncation .",
    "this computation was improved by gaiotto and rastelli  @xcite .",
    "these authors used a different approach : instead of extrapolating the finite @xmath127 results for the coefficients @xmath129 , they extrapolated the nonperturbatively computed effective potential @xmath139 at various values of @xmath116 . because pad approximants are so accurate , for exactly known values of @xmath129 and @xmath118 this approach is equivalent to the combined pad - extrapolation in @xmath129 approach , but generally this approach trades inaccuracy in @xmath129 for inaccuracy in @xmath139 . in practice",
    ", it is much easier to compute the coefficients @xmath129 exactly than the nonperturbative effective potential @xmath139 , which requires numerically solving a large system of quadratic equations .",
    "gaiotto and rastelli were able , however , to use their results on @xmath139 at higher levels , which greatly increased the accuracy of their extrapolations .",
    "they found that while level @xmath135 and @xmath140 approximations tend to be very similar , extrapolations based on level @xmath140 truncations seem more robust . using data up to level ( 16 , 48 ) they found an extrapolated value of @xmath141 , differing from @xmath142 by an order of magnitude less than the value of the energy estimated at level 28 , where the overshoot is predicted to be maximal .",
    "this gives compelling support to the conclusion that the level - truncated approximations to the energy indeed behave as shown in figure  [ f : e - l ] , and approach the value predicted by sen as @xmath133 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss some aspects of the feynman - siegel gauge choice used in most explicit calculations in osft to date .",
    "let us restrict attention to the zero momentum action for even - level scalar fields .",
    "this action is invariant under ( [ eq : sft - gauge ] ) with a general gauge parameter of the form @xmath143the ghost number zero states @xmath144 are annihilated by @xmath145 , so they do not contain @xmath146 .",
    "the variation of a general zero - momentum scalar field takes the form @xmath147 at @xmath148 , we have the linear variation @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 denote fields associated with ghost number one states that contain a @xmath146 .",
    "for example , at level two there is a field @xmath151 associated with the state @xmath152 . at each level , the number of fields @xmath150 is clearly equal to the number of gauge parameters @xmath153 ; the corresponding states are simply related by removing or replacing the @xmath146 . from the formula for @xmath154 , it is easy to verify that @xmath155 is a linear one - to - one map at each level , so @xmath156 holds at each level .",
    "this is why the feynman - siegel gauge , which sets @xmath157 at each level ( and which limits us to gauge parameters associated with states without a @xmath146 ) , is a good gauge choice near @xmath158 , as shown in subsection  [ sec : constraints - symmetries ] .",
    "let us now consider the gauge transformations at a general point in field space @xmath159 .",
    "we have @xmath160 where @xmath161 feynman - siegel gauge breaks down whenever the determinant of this matrix vanishes @xmath162 this condition defines a region in field space within which feynman - siegel gauge is valid . at the boundary of this region , some gauge transformations give field variations which are tangent to the feynman - siegel gauge - fixed hypersurface .",
    "some gauge orbits which cross the feynman - siegel gauge surface inside this region will cross again outside the region , giving a form of gribov ambiguity .",
    "furthermore , some gauge orbits never encounter the region of gauge validity .",
    "thus , feynman - siegel gauge is really only locally valid .",
    "we can study the region of feynman - siegel gauge validity in level truncation , using finite matrices @xmath163 .",
    "it is instructive to consider a simple example of the breakdown of this gauge choice .",
    "consider dropping all fields other than the tachyon @xmath164 and the field @xmath165 .",

    "one result of this computation is that the feynman - siegel gauge boundary condition @xmath172 seems to be very stable near the origin as the level of truncation is increased .",
    "this gives some confidence that there is a well - defined finite region in field space where feynman - siegel gauge is valid , and that the boundary of this region can be arbitrarily well approximated by level - truncation calculations .",
    "another interesting result which can be seen from these calculations is that ( to the precision possible in the level - truncated analysis ) the branch points in the tachyon effective potential arise precisely at those points where the trajectory in field space associated with the effective potential crosses the feynman - siegel gauge boundary .",
    "thus , these branch points are gauge artifacts .",
    "as mentioned previously , the tachyon effective potential computed from boundary string field theory does not suffer from such branch point problems .",
    "it would be very desirable , however , to have an approach which enables one to describe the full string field space , including configurations which do not have gauge representatives in the local region of feynman - siegel gauge validity .",
    "other gauge choices can be made , but those which have been explored to date are only minor variations on the feynman - siegel gauge choice , and do not lead to qualitatively different results . one might have hoped to isolate the true vacuum without gauge fixing at all , given that level truncation breaks the gauge symmetry and thus allows a discrete set of solutions at any level .",
    "this approach , however , is not particularly promising : the solutions found at each level lie at very different places on the gauge orbit , and do not approach any natural limit .",
    "nonetheless , it seems of paramount importance to find some method for exploring the full field space of the theory .",
    "currently inaccessible regions of the field space may contain solutions that have not yet been found ( see subsection  [ subsec : thebackgroundsosft ] ) .",
    "one aspect of the sen conjectures ( item ( 2 ) in the list of section  [ conjectures ] ) , proposes that lower - dimensional d - branes can be viewed as solitons of the d25-brane string field theory .",
    "the solitons involve profiles for the tachyon field which arise because the tachyon potential is non - trivial .",
    "the tachyon solitons are lumps , as opposed to kinks , which appear in superstring field theory solitons .    in this section",
    "we will discuss the basic ideas required to test this conjecture .",
    "we will follow the approach of meller , sen , and zwiebach  @xcite ( other attempts  @xcite do not use level expansion ) . in order to be able to use a level expansion",
    "we curl up one spatial coordinate @xmath98 into a circle of radius @xmath105 ( the corresponding string coordinate is called @xmath173 )",
    ". we will work with @xmath174 .",
    "along this direction , we will wrap a d1-brane .",
    "we will then consider the possibility that a certain process of tachyon condensation results in the d1-brane becoming a d0-brane .",
    "our use of d1- and d0-branes is just a matter of notational ease .",
    "additional d - brane dimensions could be included .",
    "recall that the mass of the d1-brane can be written in the form @xmath175 where @xmath2 is the coupling constant of the open string field theory that describes the d1-brane : @xmath176 a few remarks are in order . in the above string action we have included into the string coupling factor @xmath177 the volume @xmath178 of the compact circle where the d1-brane is wrapped . by doing so , we can still use a cft overlap with unit normalization , and the right - hand side in ( [ md1wvvwsmdo ] ) gives the total mass of the brane .",
    "the zero string field here is supposed to describe the vacuum with a d1-brane stretched around the circle . for time - independent string fields ( the kind of fields we consider here ) ,",
    "@xmath179 is a potential .",
    "more precisely the potential energy p.e . associated with a string field is @xmath180 where we used ( [ md1wvvwsmdo ] ) .",
    "this potential energy is really the potential energy of field configurations measured with respect to the d1-brane background .",
    "therefore , the total energy @xmath181 of the configuration is obtained by adding the energy of the d1-brane to the above p.e .",
    "we find @xmath182 since we will use the level expansion to investigate if a d0-brane can be represented as a lump solution , it is reasonable to use the level expansion to calculate the mass of the d1-brane , as well .",
    "so , we re - express the energy of the d1-brane in ( [ totenergyfs ] ) in terms of the string field potential at the vacuum .",
    "let @xmath183 denote the string field of the d1-brane sft that represents the tachyon vacuum .",
    "then , we have @xmath184 , and we can rewrite @xmath185 indeed , this formula works correctly : when @xmath186 the total energy equals the mass of the d1-brane , and when @xmath187 the energy is zero ( since the d1-brane has disappeared )",
    ".    let @xmath188 denote the lump ( string field ) solution , which is expected to represent the d0-brane in the field theory of the d1-brane .",
    "the energy of the lump solution is obtained from ( [ theenergycalcualtesjnvdkj ] ) for @xmath189 : @xmath190 the tensions @xmath191 and @xmath192 of the d0- and the d1-branes are related by @xmath193 ( the d0-brane tension is the d0-brane energy ) .",
    "we can therefore form the ratio @xmath194 of the lump energy and the d0-brane energy @xmath195 in the exact solution ( or at infinite level ) , the ratio @xmath196 should be equal to one .",
    "this is the content of the second tachyon conjecture . at any finite level @xmath196",

    "testing the conjecture for @xmath197 is quite difficult , and one must go to very high level in the computation . testing",
    "the conjecture for @xmath105 very large is also laborious , since many terms enter into any finite - level expansion .",
    "so , in practice , one chooses some reasonable value of @xmath105 ( the value @xmath198 is convenient ) and calculates to a fixed level .    before reviewing some of the results obtained ,",
    "let s do the simplest computation explicitly .",
    "we consider a tachyon field @xmath199 which is expanded as @xmath200 the corresponding string field is written as @xmath201 we now evaluate the string action , keeping @xmath202 and the first tachyon harmonic  @xmath203 : @xmath204 consider first the contribution of @xmath203 to the kinetic term @xmath205 note that , as mentioned earlier , the overlaps have unit normalization .",

    "the factors of @xmath211 and @xmath202 come from the field expansion , and the factor of two arises because there are two ways in which the momentum can be conserved .",
    "the correlator has been evaluated in a way similar to the previous computation that led to ( [ tachver ] ) .",
    "indeed , the only difference is that the conformal dimension of two of the operators has been shifted from @xmath142 to @xmath212 .",
    "collecting now our results and using the previously calculated potential for @xmath202 ( [ eq : cft - cubic - potential ] ) we find @xmath213 the original tachyon is still there : it corresponds to the field @xmath202 , which in the present expansion has no momentum . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the field @xmath203 is also a tachyon .",
    "this field is present because of the instability to form a d1-brane .",
    "indeed , for @xmath174 the energy of the d1-brane is larger than the energy of the d0-brane , and the decay is possible . for @xmath214 ,",
    "the d0-brane has more energy than the d1-brane . in this case , it is not clear if some high level computation can exhibit the d0-brane as a solution of the d1-brane field theory .",

    "the result is certainly quite good .",

    ", not all states can be written as virasoro descendents of the vacuum @xmath228 .",

    "this potential was obtained  @xcite in an attempt to construct realistic tachyon potentials , and was later confirmed to appear in the bsft approach to string field theory  @xcite .",
    "the tachyon vacuum is at @xmath239 , and surprisingly ( but correctly ! )",
    "the tachyon mass goes to infinity at this vacuum .",
    "this is consistent with the conjecture that perturbative open string degrees of freedom disappear at the tachyon vacuum .",
    "_ exercise_. show that @xmath250 is the lump solution for the potential ( [ pottachecfff ] ) and the schrdinger potential for fluctuations on the lump solution is @xmath251 , a simple harmonic oscillator potential .",

    "thus , such a solution would have positive energy with respect to the original system .",
    "the difficulty of constructing such a d0-brane solution is an example of a more general , and we believe crucial , question for osft : does osft , either through level truncation or some more sophisticated analytic approach , admit classical solutions which describe open string backgrounds with higher energy than the configuration with respect to which the theory is originally defined ? if osft is to be a truly complete formulation of string theory , such solutions must be possible , since all open string backgrounds must be accessible to the theory .",
    "another problem of this type is to find , either analytically or numerically , a solution of the osft formulated with one d25-brane that describes _ two _ d25-branes",
    ". it should be just as feasible to go from a vacuum with one d - brane to a vacuum with two d - branes as it is to go from a vacuum with one d - brane to the empty vacuum . despite some work on this problem  @xcite ,",
    "there is as yet no evidence of a solution .",
    "several approaches which have been tried include : _ i _ ) following a positive mass field upward , looking for a stable point ; this method seems to fail because of gauge - fixing problems  the effective potential often develops a singularity before reaching the energy @xmath255 , _ ii _ ) following the intuition of the rsz model ( discussed in the following section ) and constructing a gauge transform of the original d - brane solution which is @xmath256orthogonal to the original d - brane vacuum .",
    "it can be shown formally that such a state , when added to the original d - brane vacuum gives a new solution with the correct energy for a double d - brane ; unfortunately , however , we have been unable to identify such a state numerically in level truncation .",
    "while so far no progress has been made towards the construction of solutions with higher energy than the initial vacuum , it is also interesting to consider the marginal case .",
    "an example of such a situation is embodied is the problem of translating a single d - brane of less than maximal dimension in a transverse direction .",
    "it was shown by sen and zwiebach  @xcite ( in a t - dual picture ) that after moving a d - brane a finite distance of order of the string length in a transverse direction , the level - truncated string field theory equations develop a singularity .",
    "thus , in level truncation it does not seem possible to move a d - brane a macroscopic distance in a transverse direction . in this case , a toy model  @xcite suggests that the problem is that the infinitesimal marginal parameter for the brane translation ceases to parameterize the marginal trajectory in field space after a finite distance , just as the coordinate @xmath98 ceases to parameterize the circle @xmath257 near @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , an explicit calculation  @xcite of the field redefinition needed to take the osft field @xmath259 associated with the transverse motion to the correct marginal parameter @xmath260 shows that this field redefinition has a subleading term @xmath261 where @xmath262 .",
    "thus , as @xmath260 increases , eventually a point is reached where @xmath259 begins to decrease .",
    "this shows that @xmath259 is not a good parameter for marginal deformations of arbitrary size",
    ". it would be nice to have a clear understanding of how arbitrary marginal deformations are encoded in the theory .    to show that open string field theory is sufficiently general to address arbitrary questions involving different vacua , it is clearly necessary to show that the formalism is powerful enough to describe multiple brane vacua , the d0-brane lump on an arbitrary radius circle , and translated brane vacua .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the obstacles to finding these vacua are technical or conceptual .",
    "it may be that the level - truncation approach is not well - suited to finding these vacua , and a new approach is needed .",
    "the tachyon conjectures state that the classically stable vacuum is the closed string vacuum .",
    "this implies that there should be no open string excitations in this vacuum , given that the d - brane represented by the original osft has decayed and exists no more . without a d - brane conventional perturbative open string states are not expected to exist . if any perturbative states exist in this vacuum , they should be closed string states , which are only expected to appear in the quantum open string field theory .",
    "there are two natural questions concerning this conjecture .",
    "first , we ask : can it be tested ? for this , we can begin with the original osft on the background of a d25-brane , for example , and use the ( numerical ) solution @xmath263 for the tachyon vacuum to expand the classical osft around the tachyon vacuum and to calculate the spectrum .",
    "the conjecture requires that no physical states be encountered .",
    "second , we ask : is there a more natural formulation of open string theory around the tachyon vacuum , in which , for example , the background independence of the theory might be more manifest ?",
    "the theory around the tachyon vacuum , is , no doubt , rather unusual . in the tachyon vacuum",
    "there are no apparent physical states , at least none that take any familiar form .",
    "physical perturbative states can arise only from quantum effects or classically after the theory is shifted to a nontrivial background that represents some d - brane configuration .",
    "the tachyon vacuum is a rather special vacuum : it is the end product of the decay of _ any _ d - brane configuration .",
    "presumably , the theory at the tachyon vacuum is independent of the particular version of osft used to reach it upon tachyon condensation , in the sense that the string field theories associated with different d - brane configurations should be equivalent under field redefinition around the stable vacuum of each theory .",
    "if that is the case , there may exist a theory  which we can call _ vacuum string field theory _ , or vsft  which formulates the physics of the tachyon vacuum directly , _ without _ using a d - brane background to reach the tachyon vacuum .",
    "presently , there is background dependence in the formulation of witten s osft ; some specific d - brane background must be chosen to define the theory , even though this d - brane configuration may be removed through tachyon condensation . as a result ,",
    "even if the theory is in an abstract sense completely background independent , we are stuck with some particular choice of `` coordinates '' on the theory arising from the original choice of background , which may make physics in other backgrounds rather difficult to disentangle .",
    "the tachyon vacuum is also a specific background , but it is certainly a choice that is more canonical than one which picks one out of an infinite number of d - brane configurations .",
    "there are perhaps two canonical choices : an infinite number of space - filling d - branes , which has been motivated from the viewpoint of k - theory  @xcite , and a background with no d - branes whatsoever  the tachyon vacuum . in this section",
    "we investigate the second choice .",
    "a strikingly simple formulation of vsft was proposed by rastelli , sen , and zwiebach ( rsz )  @xcite , in which the brst operator is taken to be purely contained in the ghost sector . in this theory , closed - form analytic solutions that represent d",
    "- branes can be found and take the form of projectors of the star - algebra .",
    "one shortcoming of this vsft is that certain computations are singular and require regularization .",
    "it remains to be seen if a regular vsft exists .    in subsection",
    "[ sec : vacuum - theory ] we describe the form of the osft action when expanded around the classically stable tachyon vacuum . subsection [ sec : decoupling ] describes evidence from witten s osft that the open string degrees of freedom truly disappear from the theory in this vacuum . in [ sec : rsz - model ] we introduce and discuss the rsz model of vsft .",
    "subsection [ subsec : slivers ] describes an important class of states in the star algebra : slivers and projectors , which play a key role in constructing d - branes in the rsz model , and which may also be useful in understanding solutions of the witten theory .",
    "finally , in [ subsec : closedstringsinosft ] we discuss closed strings in osft .",
    "we have seen that numerical results from level - truncated string field theory strongly suggest the existence of a classically stable vacuum solution @xmath263 to the string field theory equation of motion .",
    "the state @xmath263 , while still unknown analytically , has been determined numerically to a high degree of precision .",
    "this state seems like a very well - behaved string field configuration . while there is no positive - definite inner product on the string field fock space",
    ", the state @xmath263 certainly has finite norm under the natural inner product @xmath264 , and is even better behaved under the product @xmath265 .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume that @xmath263 defines a classically stable vacuum for the theory , around which we can expand the action to find a string field theory around the tachyon vacuum .",
    "let @xmath263 be the string field configuration describing the tachyon vacuum .",
    "this string field satisfies the classical field equation @xmath266if @xmath267 denotes the shifted open string field , then the cubic string field theory action ( [ e1 ] ) expanded around the tachyon vacuum has the form : @xmath268 \\,.\\]]here @xmath269 is a constant , which according to the energetics part of the tachyon conjectures equals the tension of the d - brane times its volume ( as before , we assume that the time interval has unit length so that the action can be identified with the negative of the potential energy for static configurations ) .",
    "the kinetic operator @xmath270 is given in terms of @xmath271 and @xmath263 as : @xmath272more generally , on arbitrary string fields one would define @xmath273the consistency of the new action ( [ e2 ] ) is guaranteed from the consistency of the action in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "since neither the inner product nor the star multiplication have changed , the identities in ( [ l1e2 ] ) still hold .",
    "one can also check that the identities in ( [ l1e1 ] ) hold when @xmath271 is replaced by @xmath270 .",
    "just as the original action is invariant under the gauge transformations ( [ l1e5 ] ) , the new action is invariant under @xmath274 for any grassmann - even ghost - number zero state @xmath275 .",
    "since the energy density of the brane represents a positive cosmological constant , it is natural to add the constant @xmath276 to ( [ e1 ] )",
    ". this will cancel the @xmath269 term in ( [ e2 ] ) , and will make manifest the expected zero energy density in the final vacuum without d - brane . for the analysis around this final vacuum it suffices therefore to study the action @xmath277 \\,.\\]]this string field theory around the stable vacuum has precisely the same form as witten s original cubic string field theory , only with a different brst operator @xmath270 , which so far is only determined numerically .",
    "while this is insufficient for a complete formulation , it suffices to test the conjecture that open string excitations disappear in the tachyon vacuum , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : decoupling ]    the numerical solution for @xmath263 provides a numerical definition of the string field theory around the tachyon vacuum .",
    "how could we do better ? if we had a closed form solution @xmath263 available , the problem of formulating sft around the tachyon vacuum would be significantly simplified .",
    "it is not clear , however , that the resulting formulation would be the best possible one .",
    "previous experience with background deformations ( small and large ) in sft indicates that even if we knew @xmath263 explicitly and constructed @xmath278 using eq.([e2p ] ) , this may not be the most convenient form of the action .",
    "typically a nontrivial field redefinition is necessary to bring the shifted sft action to the canonical form representing the new background  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in some cases , such as in the formulation of open sft for d - branes with various values of magnetic fields , it is possible to formulate the various sft s directly  @xcite , but the nontrivial classical solution relating theories with different magnetic fields are not known .",
    "this suggests that if a simple form exists for the sft action around the tachyon vacuum it might be easier to guess it than to derive it .    in fact",
    ", this is exactly the approach to the formulation of vacuum string field theory ( vsft ) taken by rastelli , sen , and zwiebach ( rsz )  @xcite .",
    "these authors postulate that at the tachyon vacuum the action takes the form @xmath279 \\,,\\]]where the new kinetic operator @xmath280 is an operator build solely out of ghosts fields .",
    "if this gives a consistent theory at the tachyon vacuum , they argue , their choice of @xmath280 must be field redefinition equivalent to the @xmath270 that arises directly by shifting the original osft action with the tachyon solution @xmath263 .",
    "we discuss the rsz model in section  [ sec : rsz - model ] .",
    "it may seem surprising to imagine that _ all _ the perturbative open string degrees of freedom will vanish at a particular point in field space , since these are all the apparent degrees of freedom available in the theory .",
    "this is not a familiar phenomenon from quantum field theory . to understand how the open strings can decouple",
    ", it may be helpful to begin by considering the simple example of the ( 0 , 0 ) level - truncated theory .",
    "in this theory , the quadratic terms in the action become @xmath281 \\phi ( p ) \\ , . \\ ] ] taking @xmath282 , we find that the quadratic term is a transcendental expression which does not vanish for any real value of @xmath283 .",
    "thus , this theory has no poles , and the tachyon has decoupled from the theory .",
    "of course , this is not the full story , as there are still finite complex poles .",
    "it does , however suggest a mechanism by which the nonlocal parts of the action ( encoded in the exponential of @xmath283 ) can remove physical poles .    to get the full story , it is necessary to continue the analysis to higher level .",
    "at level 2 , there are 7 scalar fields , the tachyon and the 6 fields associated with the fock space states @xmath284 note that in this analysis we can not fix feynman - siegel gauge , as we only believe that this gauge is valid for the zero - modes of the scalar fields in the vacuum @xmath285 .",
    "an attempt at analyzing the spectrum of the theory in feynman - siegel gauge using level truncation has been made  @xcite , but gave no sensible results .",
    "diagonalizing the quadratic term in the action on the full set of 7 fields of level @xmath286 , we find  @xcite that poles develop at @xmath287 and @xmath288 ( in string units , where the tachyon has @xmath289 ) .",
    "these poles correspond to states satisfying @xmath290 .",
    "the question now is , are these states physical ? if they are exact states , of the form @xmath291 , then they are simply gauge degrees of freedom . if not , however , then they are states in the cohomology of @xmath292 and should be associated with physical degrees of freedom .",
    "unfortunately , we can not precisely determine whether the poles we find in level truncation are due to exact states , as the level - truncation procedure breaks the condition @xmath293 .",
    "thus , we can only measure _ approximately _ whether a state is exact .",
    "a detailed analysis of this question was carried out by ellwood and taylor  @xcite . in their paper , all terms in the sft action of the form @xmath294 were determined , where @xmath295 is a scalar zero - mode , and @xmath296 are nonzero - momentum scalars .",
    "in addition , all gauge transformations involving at least one zero - momentum field were computed up to level ( 6 , 12 ) . at each level",
    "up to @xmath297 , the ghost number 1 states in the kernel @xmath298 were computed . the extent",
    "to which each of these states lies in the exact subspace was measured using the formula @xmath299 where @xmath300 are an orthonormal basis for @xmath301 , the image of @xmath292 acting on the space of ghost number 0 states in the appropriate level truncation .",
    "( note that this measure involves a choice of inner product on the fock space ; several natural inner products were tried , giving roughly equivalent results ) .",
    "the result of this analysis was that up to the mass scale of the level truncation , @xmath302 , all the states in the kernel of @xmath303 were @xmath304 within the exact subspace , for @xmath305 .",

    "this analysis was only carried out for even level scalar fields ; it would be nice to check that a similar result holds for odd - level fields and for tensor fields of arbitrary rank .",
    "another more abstract argument that there are no open string states in the stable vacuum was given by ellwood , feng , he and moeller  @xcite .",
    "these authors argued that in the stable vacuum , the identity state @xmath306 in the sft star algebra , which satisfies @xmath307 for a very general class of string fields @xmath259 , seems to be an exact state , @xmath308 if indeed the identity is exact , then it follows immediately that the cohomology of @xmath292 is empty , since @xmath309 then implies that @xmath310 so to prove that the cohomology of @xmath292 is trivial , it suffices to show that @xmath311 . while there are some subtleties involved with the identity string field , ellwood _ et al .",

    "generalizing this analysis to higher levels , they found at levels 5 , 7 , and 9 , a deviation from exactness of @xmath323 and @xmath324 respectively . at level 9 , for example",
    ", the identity field has 118 components , and there are only 43 gauge parameters , so this is a highly nontrivial check on the exactness of the identity . like the results of ellwood and taylor  @xcite , these results strongly support the conclusion that the cohomology of the theory is trivial in the stable vacuum . in this case",
    ", the result applies to fields of all spins and all ghost numbers .",
    "given that the witten string field theory seems to have a classical solution with no perturbative open string excitations , in accordance with sen s conjectures , it is quite interesting to ask what the physics of the string field theory in the stable vacuum should describe .",
    "one natural assumption might be that this theory should include closed string states in its quantum spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , addressing this question requires performing calculations in the quantum theory around the stable vacuum .",
    "such calculations are quite difficult ( although progress in this direction has been made by minahan in the @xmath14-adic version of the theory  @xcite ) . even in the perturbative vacuum , it is difficult to systematically study closed strings in the quantum string from theory .",
    "we discuss this question again in the final subsection of this section .",
    "our discussion in section  [ sec : vacuum - theory ] suggests that a vsft may be formulated as a cubic string field theory , with some new choice @xmath280 for the kinetic operator .",
    "the choice of @xmath280 will be required to satisfy the following properties :    * the operator @xmath280 must be of ghost number one and must satisfy the conditions ( [ l1e1 ] ) that guarantee gauge invariance of the string action .",
    "* the operator @xmath280 must have vanishing cohomology . *",
    "the operator @xmath280 must be universal , namely , it must be possible to write without reference to the brane boundary conformal field theory .",
    "the first condition is unavoidable ; the theory must be gauge invariant if it is to be consistent .",
    "the second condition is reasonable , but perhaps stronger than needed : all we probably know is that there should be no cohomology at ghost number one , which is the ghost number at which physical states appear .",
    "the third constraint is the most stringent one .",
    "it implies that vsft is an intrinsic theory that can be formulated without using an auxiliary d - brane .",
    "the simplest possible choice is @xmath325 , which gives the purely cubic version of open string field theory  @xcite . indeed",
    ", it has long been tempting to identify the tachyon vacuum with a theory where the kinetic operator vanishes because , lacking the kinetic term , the string field gauge symmetries are not spontaneously broken",
    ". nevertheless , there are well - known complications with this identification .",
    "the string field shift @xmath326 that relates the cubic to the purely cubic osft appears to satisfy @xmath327 as well as @xmath328 .",
    "the tachyon condensate definitely does not satisfy these two identities .",
    "we therefore search for nonzero @xmath280 .",
    "we can satisfy the three requirements by letting @xmath329 be constructed purely from ghost operators . in particular we claim that the ghost number one operators @xmath330satisfy the properties @xmath331 the first property is manifest .",
    "the last property follows because under bpz conjugation @xmath332 .",
    "the second property follows from the conservation laws  @xcite @xmath333these conservation laws arise by consideration of integrals of the form @xmath334 where @xmath335 is a globally defined quadratic differential .",
    "each of the operators @xmath336 has vanishing cohomology . to see this note that for each @xmath112 the operator @xmath337 satisfies @xmath338",
    "it then follows that whenever @xmath339 , we have @xmath340 , showing that @xmath341 is @xmath336 trivial .",
    "since they are built from ghost oscillators , all @xmath336 s are manifestly universal .",
    "it is clear from the structure of the consistency conditions that we can take @xmath342 , where the @xmath343 s are constant coefficients .",
    "as we will see below , many properties of the rsz theory follow simply from the fact that @xmath280 is pure ghost .",
    "but , there are some computations that may require a choice of @xmath280 ( more on this later ) .",
    "the work of hata and kawano  @xcite gave the clue for the choice of @xmath280 taken by rsz : @xmath344 since the canonical zero - time open string in the complex @xmath101-plane is the half - circle @xmath345 that lies on the upper half plane , the operator @xmath346 represents a ghost insertion precisely at the open string midpoint .",
    "this is the most delicate point on the open string given that the three string interaction is a world - sheet with a curvature singularity at the point where the three string midpoints meet .",

    "although the constant @xmath350 can be absorbed into a rescaling of @xmath351 , this changes the normalization of @xmath352 .",
    "we shall instead choose a convenient normalization of @xmath280 and keep the constant @xmath350 in the action as in eq.([eg1 ] ) .    in this vsft",
    "the ansatz was made that any d@xmath14-brane solution takes the factorized form  @xcite @xmath353where @xmath354 denotes a state obtained by acting with the ghost oscillators on the sl(2,r ) invariant vacuum of the ghost cft , and @xmath355 is a state obtained by acting with matter operators on the sl(2,r ) invariant vacuum of the matter cft .",
    "let us denote by @xmath356 and @xmath357 the star product in the ghost and matter sector respectively .",
    "eq.([e2 ] ) then factorizes as @xmath358and @xmath359this last equation is particularly simple : it states that @xmath355 is a projector ( a projector @xmath360 in an algebra with product @xmath361 is an element that satisfies @xmath362 ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath354 appears to be more complicated .    for any string field configuration @xmath363 that satisfies the equation of motion , the action is given by @xmath364 and with the ansatz ( [ eo3 ] )",

    "kawano , and moriyama , showed that the relationship @xmath369 between the d25-brane tension and the string coupling can be tested in vsft without knowledge of the explicit form of the purely ghost @xmath280 .",

    "if @xmath280 is given by ( [ ep1 ] ) , the solution of ( [ eo4 ] ) is simply the sliver state of the twisted conformal field theory .",
    "@xcite    we conclude this subsection with some comments on regularization and the singular aspects of vsft .",
    "arguments by gross and taylor  @xcite , and by schnabl ( unpublished ) indicated that the brane tension associated with vsft solutions is zero for any finite @xmath350 .",

    "therefore the new action is consistent .",
    "the operator @xmath270 is , by construction , regular , while @xmath386 , which we want to be equal to the vsft operator @xmath280 , should be an infinite constant times a ghost insertion at the string midpoint ( the infinite constant is necessary because @xmath2 is finite ) .",
    "a large class of string reparameterizations that leave the open string midpoint invariant can be constructed with operators @xmath382 that satisfy the relations ( [ efderp ] ) .",
    "a reparameterization in which a finite part of the string is squeezed into an infinitesimal neighborhood of the string midpoint will turn a regular @xmath270 that contains a term linear in the ghost field , into an operator @xmath386 whose leading term is precisely a divergent ghost insertion at the string midpoint .  @xcite this happens because the term linear in the ghost field is the term with an operator of lowest possible dimension , and a squeezing transformation , will transform this negative - dimension operator with an infinite factor .",
    "it is thus plausible that a singular squeezing transformation relates the string field theory around the tachyon vacuum to the rsz theory .      from the point of view of the rsz approach to vsft",
    "just discussed , projection operators of the star algebra play a crucial role in the construction of solutions of the theory .",
    "such projection operators may also be useful in understanding solutions in the original witten theory .",

    "we now briefly review some of the important features of projectors .",
    "= 11 cm    the first matter projector which was explicitly constructed is the `` sliver '' state .",
    "this state was identified as a conformal field theory surface state by rastelli and zwiebach  @xcite . as such",
    ", there is a surface associated with the state : a disk with one puncture on the boundary and a specified local coordinate at the puncture .",
    "this conformal field theory picture gives a complete state ; it includes both the matter and the ghost part of the state .",
    "moreover , the state can be constructed for any conformal field theory : @xmath387the geometrical picture of the sliver state is shown in figure  [ f9 ] .",
    "the full punctured disk is the glued surface obtained by attaching the infinite helix and the coordinate patch , which carries the puncture  @xmath360 .",
    "there are many alternative pictures of the sliver .",
    "= 10 cm    to understand why the sliver state squares to itself one must have a picture of star multiplication for surface states . a full discussion  @xcite would take too long , but",
    "the rough idea is easily explained .",
    "the sliver state is essentially the limit @xmath388 , where multiplication is performed via the star product .",
    "a surface state in a bcft can be viewed ( by excising the coordinate patch ) as a disk whose boundary has two parts : a part in which the boundary condition that defines the bcft is imposed , and a part which represents an open string . to star -",
    "multiply two surface states , one glues the right - half of the string in the first surface to the left - half of the string in the second surface ; the resulting surface is the surface that represents the star product .",
    "a particularly simple class of surface states are sector states or wedge states .",
    "one such state @xmath389 is shown to the left of figure  [ f8 ] .",
    "the bcft boundary condition applies to the curved boundary of the sector .",
    "the radial segment am is the left - half of the open string and the radial segment @xmath390 is the right - half of the open string .",
    "the sector state is defined by the angle @xmath319 at the string midpoint @xmath167 . in the figure",
    "we show the multiplication of @xmath389 and @xmath391 .",
    "the result is a sector state @xmath392 with total angle @xmath393 .",
    "the sliver state @xmath394 is the wedge state @xmath395 with infinite angle .",
    "it is then clear that the star product of two slivers is still a wedge state of infinite angle , and thus also a sliver .",
    "the state obtained in the limit when the angle is equal to zero is in fact the identity state of the star algebra .",
    "it is manifestly clear that the product of any surface state with the identity gives the surface state .",
    "the identity state can also be written as an exponential of virasoro operators acting on the vacuum .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in section [ sec : decoupling ] , a very curious result was found  @xcite : @xmath396 with the virasoro operators of higher level stacking to the left .",
    "we thus confirm that the identity is also a virasoro descendent of the vacuum .    in an independent construction , kostelecky and potting  @xcite",
    "constructed a state @xmath397 of the matter sector of the d25-brane bcft that squared to itself ( up to a proportionality constant ) .",
    "the construction used the oscillator language .",
    "this matter state takes the form of a squeezed state @xmath398| 0 \\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sliver - squeezed}\\ ] ] by requiring that such a state satisfy the projection equation @xmath399 , and by making some further assumptions about the nature of the state , an explicit formula for the matrix @xmath400 was found in terms of the matrix @xmath173 from ( [ eq : matx ] )  @xcite .",
    "evidence quickly emerged that the state constructed by these authors is the matter sector of the sliver state , and a proof was given by okuda  @xcite .",
    "there are many other projectors that also have a simple picture as surface states  @xcite . in these projectors , the open string midpoint approaches ( or even coincides with ) the boundary of the surface where the boundary condition is applied .",
    "one particularly useful projector , which arises in the numerical solution of vsft , is the so - called _ butterfly _ state @xmath401 .",
    "this is a very interesting state , whose picture is shown in figure  [ f2butter ] .",
    "when one glues two butterfly surfaces in the manner required by star - multiplication , the resulting surface does not appear to be , at first sight , another butterfly . nevertheless , the resulting surface is conformally equivalent to a butterfly , and this is , in fact , all that is needed in order to have a projector .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the butterfly is the state that can be represented as the tensor product @xmath402 , where @xmath403 is the vacuum of the half - string state space  @xcite . generally , any state of the form @xmath404 where @xmath405 is the same state in the left and right half - string fock spaces is a projector  @xcite .",
    "the butterfly has a remarkably simple expression as a virasoro descendent of the vacuum @xmath406 ) .",
    "particular projectors like the sliver can be constructed which are localized in any number of space - time dimensions , corresponding to the codimension of a d - brane . under gauge transformations ,",
    "a rank one projector can be rotated into an orthogonal rank one projector , so that configurations containing multiple branes can be constructed as higher rank projectors formed from the sum of orthogonal rank one projectors  @xcite .",
    "this gives a very suggestive picture of how arbitrary d - brane configurations can be constructed in string field theory .",
    "while this picture is quite compelling , however , there are some technical obstacles which make this still a somewhat incomplete story . in the rsz model",
    ", singularities appear due to the separation of the matter and ghost sectors .",
    "moreover , projectors are , in general , somewhat singular states .",
    "for example , the matrix @xmath400 associated to the matter part of the sliver state has eigenvalues of @xmath407 for any d@xmath14-brane  @xcite .",
    "such eigenvalues cause these states to be non - normalizable elements of the matter fock space in the dirichlet directions , this lack of normalizability occurs because the state is essentially localized to a point and is analogous to a delta function . in the neumann directions , the singularity manifests as a `` breaking '' of the strings composing the d - brane , so that the functional describing the projector state is a product of a function of the string configurations on the left and right halves of the string , with no connection mediated through the midpoint .",
    "these geometric singularities seem to be generic features of the matter part of any projector , not just the sliver state  @xcite .",
    "the singular geometric features of projectors , which can be traced to the fact that the open string midpoint approaches the boundary , makes certain calculations in the rsz theory somewhat complicated , as all singularities must be regulated .",
    "singularities do not seem to appear in the witten theory , where the brst operator and the numerically calculated solutions seem to behave smoothly at the string midpoint . on the other hand",
    ", it may be that further study of the projectors will lead to analytic progress on the witten theory , as discussed in a recent paper by okawa  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed in earlier sections the fact that open string field theory , formulated on the background of a certain bcft appears to capture many other open string backgrounds as solutions of the theory .",
    "apart from its singular features , the rsz theory admits any bcft as a solution of the theory .",
    "one important question remains : can closed string backgrounds be incorporated in open string field theory ?",
    "the question can be answered both in the context of osft and in the context of the rsz model .",
    "as we will discuss , there is very little concrete evidence as yet that this can be done in any of the two approaches .",
    "we therefore ask a simpler question : can closed string states be seen in open string field theory ?",
    "the answer here is yes , both in osft , and in vsft ( modulo the usual singularities ) , although so far this has been understood only in certain limited contexts .    as has been known since the earliest days of the subject , closed strings appear as poles in perturbative open string scattering amplitudes",
    "this was demonstrated explicitly for witten s theory by exhibiting the closed string poles arise in the one - loop 2-point function  @xcite ( although in this calculation , spurious poles also appear which complicate the interpretation ) .",
    "more recently , in a similar calculation the closed string tadpole generated by the d - brane was identified in the one - loop open string 1-point function  @xcite . while in principle",
    "this type of argument can be used to construct all on - shell closed string amplitudes through factorization , it is much less clear how to think of asymptotic or off - shell closed string states in this context . if witten s theory is well - defined as a quantum theory , it would follow from unitarity that the closed string states should also arise in some natural sense as asymptotic states of the quantum open string field theory .",
    "it is currently rather unclear , however , whether , and if so how , this might be realized .",
    "there are subtleties in the quantum formulation of the theory which have never completely been resolved  @xcite , although most of the problems of the quantum theory seem to be generated by the closed string tachyon , and may be absent in a supersymmetric theory .",
    "both older sft literature  @xcite and recent work  @xcite have suggested ways in which closed strings might be incorporated into the open string field theory , but a definitive resolution of this question is still not available .    in the rsz model ,",
    "one description of _ on - shell _ closed string states is reasonably natural  @xcite and scattering amplitudes have been computed  @xcite . for each on - shell closed string vertex operator @xmath408 one can construct a gauge - invariant open string state @xmath409 , where @xmath363 is the open string field , and the gauge invariance is the open string gauge invariance .",
    "the world - sheet picture of the state is that of an amputated semi - infinite strip whose edge represents the open strings , the two halves of which are glued and the closed string operator is inserted at the conical singularity .",
    "given a set of gauge invariant operators associated with a set of on - shell closed string vertex operators , the rsz correlator of the gauge invariant operators appears to give , up to proportionality factors that need regulation , the on - shell closed string amplitude on a surface _ without _ boundaries .",
    "this result uses a nontrivial and unusual decomposition of the moduli space of riemann surfaces without boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the decomposition , is related to , but distinct from the one used in witten s theory to cover the moduli space of riemann surfaces that have at least one boundary .",
    "other decompositions have been discussed by drukker  @xcite .",
    "if it were possible to encode _ off - shell _ physics naturally into open string field theory it would be reasonable to hope that closed string backgrounds could be changed by suitable expectation values of open string fields although this would presumably be a subtle effect in the quantum theory , and difficult to compute explicitly .",
    "attaining a description of the full closed string landscape  @xcite using quantum osft is clearly an optimistic scenario , but it need not be farfetched ; it may represent an extension of the ads / cft correspondence , in which the cft side is changed from sym into the full open string field theory .",
    "if , as it may be , it turns out to be that the closed string sector of the theory is encoded in a singular fashion in osft , one may be better off directly working with closed string field theory  @xcite , or with open / closed string field theory  @xcite .",
    "because of the nonpolynomiality of these theories , it is not known at present if level expansion can be used to extract nonperturbative information . at any rate , it would be useful to have a clear picture of how far one can incorporate closed string physics from the open string point of view .",
    "even if this can not be realistically achieved in our current models of sft , understanding the difficulties involved may help us in our search for a better formulation of the theory .",
    "the work described in these lectures has brought the understanding of string field theory to a new level .",
    "we now have fairly conclusive evidence that open string field theory can successfully describe distinct vacua with very different geometrical properties , which are not related to one another through a marginal deformation . the resulting picture , in which a complicated set of degrees of freedom defined primarily through an algebraic structure , can produce different geometrical backgrounds as different solutions of the equations of motion , represents an important step beyond perturbative string theory .",
    "such a framework is clearly necessary to discuss questions of a cosmological nature in string theory . for such questions , however",
    ", one must generalize from the work described here in which the theory describes distinct _ open _ string backgrounds , to a formalism where different _ closed _ string backgrounds also appear as solutions of the equations .",
    "ideally , we would like to have a formulation of string / m - theory in which all the currently understood vacua can arise in terms of a single well - defined set of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , how far it is possible go towards this goal using the current formulations of string field theory",
    ". it may be that the correct lesson to take from the work described here is simply that there _ are _ nonperturbative formulations in which distinct vacua can be brought together as solutions of a single classical theory , and that one should search for some deeper fundamental algebraic formulation where geometry , and even the dimension of space - time emerge from the fundamental degrees of freedom in the same way that d - brane geometry emerges from the degrees of freedom of witten s open string field theory . a more conservative scenario , however , might be that we could perhaps use the current framework of string field theory , or some limited refinement thereof , to achieve this goal of providing a universal nonperturbative definition of string theory and m - theory . following this latter scenario ,",
    "we propose here a series of questions aimed at continuing the recent developments in open string field theory as far as possible towards this ultimate goal .",
    "it is not certain that this research program can be carried to its conclusion , but it will be very interesting to see how far open string field theory can go in reproducing important nonperturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "there are , in our mind , two very important concrete problems related to witten s string field theory that so far have resisted solution :    1 .",
    "finding an analytic description of the tachyonic vacuum . despite several years of work on this problem , great success with numerical approximations , and some insight from the rsz vacuum string field theory model ,",
    "we still have no closed form expression for the string field @xmath263 which represents the tachyon vacuum in witten s open string field theory .",
    "it seems almost unbelievable that there is not some elegant analytic solution to this problem .",
    "an analytic solution would almost certainly greatly enhance our understanding of this theory and would lead to other significant advances .",
    "2 .   finding certain open string backgrounds as solutions of open string field theory . as discussed in section  [ subsec : thebackgroundsosft ] , we do not know how to obtain a background with multiple d - branes starting with a background with one d - brane . nor we know how to obtain the background which represents a d0-brane using the background of a d1-brane with lower energy .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the obstacles to finding these vacua are conceptual or technical .",
    "there are other questions that are probably important to the future development of string field theory .",
    "these represent , in our opinion , subjects that merit investigation :    1 .",
    "is there a regular formulation of vsft ?",
    "such a version of the theory may have further similarities with bsft and could turn out to be a complete and flexible formulation of open string field theory .",
    "how do closed string backgrounds appear in open string field theory ?",
    "while osft and vsft appear to give somewhat singular / intractable descriptions of closed string physics , some better understood , or new , version of open string theory might provide a tractable description of closed string physics .",
    "another possibility is that closed string fields are needed in addition to open string fields ; this is the case in light - cone open string field theory and in covariant open / closed string field theory .",
    "what are the new features of superstring field theory ?",
    "the status of the tachyon conjectures for the superstring has been reviewed by ohmori  @xcite .",
    "the large set of symmetries of superstring theory makes them , in many cases , more tractable than bosonic string theories .",
    "nevertheless , as of yet , there is no clear sense in which superstring field theory is simpler than bosonic string field theory  @xcite .",
    "there are also significant conceptual problems that have not allowed a formulation of vacuum superstring field theory  @xcite .",
    "4 .   how do we describe time - dependent tachyon dynamics ?",
    "string field theory gives clear and concrete evidence for the sen conjectures .",
    "although we have not studied this subject in the present review , there is much interest in the process by which the tachyon rolls from the unstable critical point down to the tachyon vacuum .",
    "@xcite in fact , the early attempts to describe the rolling of the tachyon in witten s string field theory  @xcite appear to be in contradiction with the results that follow from conformal field theory .",
    "it is challenging to imagine a single set of degrees of freedom which could encode , in different phases , all the possible string backgrounds we are familiar with , including those associated with m - theory . in principle",
    ", a nonperturbative background - independent formulation of type ii string theory should allow one to take the string coupling to infinity in such a way that the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory remain at some finite point in the configuration space .",
    "this would lead to the vacuum associated with m - theory in flat space - time",
    ". it would be quite remarkable if this can be achieved in the framework of string field theory . given the nontrivial relationship between string fields and low - energy effective degrees of freedom , such a result need not be farfetched .",
    "if this picture could be successfully implemented , it would give a very satisfying representation of the complicated network of dualities of string and m - theory in terms of a single underlying set of degrees of freedom .",
