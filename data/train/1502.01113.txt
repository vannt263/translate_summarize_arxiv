    "deep virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite is the main process to probe the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "recently , the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite have attracted a considerable amount of interest towards this .",
    "gpds allow us to access partonic configurations not only with a given longitudinal momentum fraction but also at a specific ( transverse ) location inside the hadron .",
    "gpds can be related to the angular momentum carried by quarks in the nucleon and the distribution of quarks can be described in the longitudinal direction as well as in the impact parameter space @xcite .",
    "when integrated over @xmath3 the gpds reduce to the form factors which are the non - forward matrix element of the current operator and they describe how the forwards matrix element ( charge ) is distributed in position space .",
    "the gpds are the off - forward matrix elements and it is well known that they reduce to parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the forward limit . on the other hand ,",
    "fourier transform ( ft ) of gpds w.r.t .",
    "transverse momentum transfer gives the distribution of partons in transverse position space @xcite .",
    "therefore , their should be some connection between transverse position of partons and ft of gpds w.r.t .",
    "transverse momentum transfer .    with the help of impact parameter dependent parton distribution function ( ipdpdf )",
    "one can obtain the transverse position of partons in the transverse plane .",
    "however , it is not possible to measure the longitudinal position of partons . in order to measure the transverse position with the longitudinal momentum",
    "simultaneously we can consider the polarized nucleon state in the transverse direction which leads to distorted unpolarized ipdpdf in the tranverse plane @xcite .",
    "distortion obtained in the transverse plane also leads to single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) and it has been shown that such asymmetries can be explained by final state interactions ( fsi ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism gives us a good interpretation of ssas which arises from the asymmetry ( left - right ) of quarks distribution in impact parameter space .",
    "to study the gpds , we use light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) which give a very simple representation of gpds .",
    "impact parameter dependent parton distribution functions have been investigated by using the explicit lfwfs for the two - particle fock state of the electron in qed @xcite . in the present study we use",
    "the model consisting of spin-@xmath4 system as a composite of spin-@xmath4 fermion and spin-1 vector boson .",
    "we have generalized the framework of qed by assigning a mass @xmath5 to external electrons in the compton scattering process , but a different mass @xmath6 to the internal electron line and a mass @xmath7 to the internal photon line .",
    "the idea behind this is to model the structure of a composite fermion state with a mass @xmath5 by a fermion and a vector constituent with respective masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . in our case",
    "we take @xmath0 @xcite which represents the momentum transfer exclusively in transverse direction leading to the study of ipdpdfs in transverse impact parameter space . in order to show the relation of the lfwfs in the two - particle fock state of the electron in qed to a realistic model of nucleon physics ,",
    "we have designed a specific weight function of our model lfwfs and integrated it over the mass parameter .",
    "the dirac and pauli form factors have been simulated to obtain the correct perturbative qcd fall - off of the form factors at large @xmath8 .",
    "also we have simulated the form factor of the nucleon in the ads / qcd holographic lfwfs model @xcite and studied the power - law behaviour of wavefunction at short distances .    for the case of spin flip",
    "gpd @xmath1 , the parton distribution is distorted in the transverse plane when the target has a transverse polarization and when integrated over @xmath3 , @xmath1 yields the pauli form factor @xmath9 .",
    "the study of the fourier transformed gpd @xmath10 is important for a transversely polarized target since it measures the distortion of the parton distribution in the transverse plane .",
    "integrating ipdpdf @xmath10 over @xmath11 and @xmath3 gives us the magnetic moment .",
    "the sign of distortion can be concluded from the sign of the magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "we extend the calculations to determine this sign of distortion from the unintegrated momentum space distribution obtained directly from the lfwfs which can be obtained after performing a ft to relative position space coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "this is the another direct way to determine the sign of distortion from the lfwfs .",
    "the explicit relation between the deformation calculated from gpds in the impact parameter space and the deformation calculated directly from the lfwfs can also be obtained .",
    "the gpds @xmath12 are defined through matrix elements of the bilinear vector currents on the light cone @xcite : & & e^i",

    "the off - forward matrix elements can be expressed as overlaps of the light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) for the two - particle fock state of the electron in qed .",

    "<S> we investigate the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) in impact parameter space using the explicit light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) for the two - particle fock state of the electron in qed . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform ( ft ) of the gpds gives the distribution of quarks in the transverse plane for zero longitudinal momentum transfer ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the relationship of the spin flip gpd @xmath1 with the distortion of unpolarized quark distribution in the transverse plane when the target nucleon is transversely polarized and also determine the sign of distortion from the sign of anomalous magnetic moment . to verify the sign of distortion , </S>",
    "<S> we also compute it directly from the lfwfs by performing a ft in position space coordinate @xmath2 . the explicit relation between the deformation in the two spaces </S>",
    "<S> can also be obtained using the convolution integrals . to show the relation of the model lfwfs to a realistic model of nucleon physics , we have designed a specific weight function of our model lfwfs and integrated it over the mass parameter . </S>",
    "<S> also we have simulated the form factor of the nucleon in the ads / qcd holographic lfwfs model and studied the power - law behaviour at short distances . </S>"
