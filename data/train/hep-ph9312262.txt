    "this is a model independent framework that relates processes where a heavy quark of mass @xmath27 exchanges momenta smaller than @xmath28 with the light degrees of freedom inside the hadron .",
    "hqet makes manifest the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian that occur in the infinite heavy quark limit : a flavor symmetry which relates the mass splittings and decay amplitudes of hadrons with different heavy quark content , and a spin symmetry which simplifies the mass spectrum and relates the decay amplitudes of hadrons with the same heavy quark content , but with different heavy quark spin .",
    "the spin symmetry is analogous to the proton spin symmetry in the hydrogen atom spectrum , which is broken only weakly by the hyperfine splittings .",

    "this is a better way of fitting to perturbative qcd than simply assuming a pole form for the vector and axial - vector form factors because we require the parametrization to match the heavy  light form factors in the perturbative regime .",

    "these values can be systematically improved by higher order ( in @xmath217 ) calculations@xcite . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "we have reason to believe that the @xmath217 contribution is a good approximation to the full result .",
    "we will consider a five parameter fit to the two form factors .",
    "vector dominance ideas , that the amplitude is dominated by intermediate @xmath242 resonances , dictate that reasonable forms for the interpolating form factors are @xmath144 ( single pole ) , @xmath227 ( dipole ) , or a constant ( subtraction ) . a subtraction is not considered for @xmath127 because the physical axial - vector form factor @xmath243 , so that a constant term in @xmath127 would correspond to @xmath244 which is `` inconsistent '' with vector dominance .",

    ", with this result , we find @xmath253 here we have quoted only the experimental uncertainty , about @xmath254 from  data , and @xmath255 from  data , which in turn are added in quadrature .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are discussed in the next section .",
    "this result compares quite well with the standard model value @xmath256 extracted from @xmath257 and the unitarity of the ckm matrix ( discussed in sec .  1 ) .",
    "therefore our analysis shows that the  data agrees with the standard model , and should be used to place constraints on non - standard model physics .",
    "now consider theoretical corrections to our result for  given by eqn .",
    "( [ vts ] ) .",
    "we consider corrections to the heavy quark symmetry relations , to the @xmath258 matching conditions , and uncertainty in the top quark mass .",
    "the corrections to heavy quark symmetry relations are due to physics which violates the assumption that in the rest frame of the heavy meson , the heavy quark is also at rest .",
    "the first of this type is due to the qcd interactions with gluons and light quarks in the heavy meson .",
    "the correction factor is@xcite @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the mass difference between the heavy meson and heavy quark . for a conservatively low value of @xmath261 gev , this correction is roughly @xmath262 for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the second type of hqet correction occurs when the momentum transfer between initial and final mesons is large .",
    "then , the emission of a hard gluon by the heavy quark before its decay can give the heavy quark a large velocity with respect to the meson rest frame . the naive estimate of this effect is@xcite @xmath263 at zero @xmath139 .",
    "however , studies of these qcd corrections indicate that the problem caused by the leading gluon exchange diagram is strongly suppressed by an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "we have used the perturbative qcd calculation of sec .  3 to estimate these corrections .",
    "they are of the form @xmath264 where @xmath265 this correction comes from from the diagram of fig .",
    "( 2a ) . we evaluated it for @xmath266 as defined in sec .  3 , and plot the the ratios @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 in fig .",
    "= 4truein    as @xmath61 grows much larger than @xmath270 , these corrections actually dominate the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the solid line of fig .",
    "7 evaluated at @xmath250 gives an estimate of these corrections to  of about @xmath271 .",
    "while the @xmath272 corrections are impossible to estimate via perturbation theory because @xmath57 so close to one , heavy quark symmetry dictates that they should have the same form as the @xmath273 corrections , that is , they are systematically correlated .",
    "the experimental values for the @xmath95 s at @xmath57 includes these corrections , while our perturbative analysis does not .",
    "therefore these errors systematically compensate each other in the final result , so we use @xmath271 uncertainty total , including both corrections .",
    "another source of hqet violations are perturbative correction which can not be included in the definitions of the heavy  light form factors @xmath116 . from our perturbative calculation , we find that the dominant source of these corrections , which are proportional to @xmath274 , are precisely the same algebraic form as the @xmath275 corrections to the @xmath116 as discussed above .",
    "it is clearly difficult to assign a percentage of uncertainty to these corrections , since we have not calculated the precise way in which they feed into our calculation of , so we make a naive estimate of @xmath276 total uncertainty from them .",
    "this value is smaller than the naive estimate of @xmath277 , but not by an order of magnitude as was hoped@xcite .",
    "we also need to estimate corrections to our perturbative qcd calculation of the matching conditions given by eqns .",
    "( [ ratios ] ) .",
    "that is , we wish to estimate the uncertainty due to the running of the form factors from @xmath55 to @xmath250 .",
    "it has been suggested in the literature that the @xmath217 contribution to the form factors may be producing only @xmath278 of the full result@xcite . in this case , the matching conditions would be meaningless .    to check this , we use eqn .",
    "( [ ekappa ] ) to determine @xmath70 . from the  data and our fits",
    ", we find @xmath279 where we have quoted experimental uncertainties .",
    "to extract @xmath70 from eqn .",
    "( [ ekappa ] ) , we use @xmath280 , and @xmath281 mev from qcd sum rules@xcite . this sum rule estimate of @xmath180 is supposedly is good to about @xmath282 .",
    "this yields @xmath283 this is a rather large value of @xmath70 , when compared to numerous lattice estimates@xcite of @xmath284 to @xmath285 mev .",
    "however , it is not an order of magnitude larger than these values , which would be the case if the @xmath217 corrections contributed only @xmath278 to the full result for the form factors . in addition",
    ", the calculation of @xmath70 done here assumes the leading hqet relations between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson systems .",
    "decay constants are well known to receive large @xmath210 corrections in the hqet@xcite , and these should be taken into account before a real prediction of @xmath70 is made via  and  data .",
    "a final note on this topic is that there is new evidence that the lattice calculations may systematically underestimate heavy quark decay constants .",
    "the recently measured@xcite @xmath286 decay constant s central value is about 1.5 times the central values of the lattice estimates .",
    "we conclude that the order @xmath217 calculation is indeed dominating the form factor calculation at @xmath250 . and a more proper way of calculating @xmath70 would be to include all @xmath287 corrections in the hqet .",
    "since the normalization of the form factors is set by experiment in our case , the error in @xmath70 is not directly correlated with error in .",
    "our input for  from perturbative qcd are the ratios @xmath288 defined in equation ( [ ratios ] ) .",
    "we currently have no systematic way of estimating their uncertainties due to higher order corrections , other that to apply that standard @xmath289 rule for the next to leading order correction .",
    "this yields a naively small error estimate of @xmath290 . clearly , an explicit @xmath291 calculation of the type given by field et .",
    "al.@xcite would pin this uncertainty down further .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath292 is about @xmath278 . our uncertainty in the soft physics which goes into the perturbative calculation",
    "can also be estimated .",
    "the peaking approximation for the heavy meson distribution amplitude yields about @xmath293 , and the uncertainty in the @xmath48 wavefunction about @xmath294 .",
    "in addition , our perturbative qcd calculation is sensitive to the ir cutoff used to regulate our perturbative momentum fraction integrals .",
    "this is the standard `` solution '' to the ir problem in heavy ",
    "light systems as discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "this aspect of the calculation definitively needs to be improved to given more confidence to the application of perturbative qcd to heavy quark systems .",
    "( our philosophy in this paper has been to apply this `` well known '' qcd technology . ) one way of estimating uncertainty due to this ambiguity is to perform the calculation for various distribution amplitudes .",
    "while the results were not displayed , we found that the @xmath223 distribution amplitude gives essentially the same result for @xmath7 , to within about @xmath278 uncertainty .",
    "the similarity of the result is already evident from fig .",
    "3 . finally ,",
    "theoretical uncertainty from the top quark mass adds about @xmath295 .",
    "we combine the theoretical uncertainty into two parts .",
    "the first part consists of uncertainty due to corrections in hqet and the top quark mass .",
    "they give about @xmath296 when added in quadrature , with the dominant contributions comming from @xmath297 type corrections .",
    "the second type of theoretical uncertainties come from running the form factors from @xmath57 to @xmath58 via the perturbative qcd matching conditions .",
    "we estimate uncertainty of about @xmath298 from perturbative qcd uncertainties . clearly , these are very difficult to estimate because we do nt know how the qcd corrections feed into the matching conditions eqns .",
    "( [ ratios ] ) .",
    "however , because we are using perturbative qcd rather than simply making a pole or dipole ansatz for the form factors , we can make an estimate that can be systematically improved as the perturbative calculations become more sophisticated .",
    "hence we find a total estimated theoretical uncertainty of about @xmath299 from all sources when added in quadrature .",
    "we find a value for the mixing angle of about @xmath300 where the second one @xmath301 uncertainty is a naive estimate of total theoretical errors .",
    "it is naive because it is an estimate of higher order corrections that we have not calculated .",
    "we believe that this factor can be substantially reduced by further work on @xmath210 hqet corrections to the heavy quark matching between @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems , and an order @xmath302 calculation of the perturbative qcd matching conditions for the heavy  light form factors at @xmath250 .",
    "the most disturbing theoretical uncertainty seems , at this point , to be the ir sensitivity of the perturbative qcd calculation , which we have estimated to be @xmath278 .",
    "our value compares very well with the standard model result@xcite of @xmath303 , that is , our result is consistent with three generations of quarks , and the standard model contributions to the @xmath6 penguin .",
    "we can compare our result with recent lattice estimates of the hadronic tensor form factor for decay .",
    "the ukqcd group@xcite estimates @xmath304 , and with an additional assumption of spectator mass independence , @xmath305 .",
    "bernard _ et .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath306 using a pole form ansatz .",
    "these results should be compared to our result of @xmath307 , where we quote separately experimental and theoretical uncertainty .",
    "( there is less experimental uncertainty than for  since we do not require  data for this parameter ) .",
    "the qcd sum rule technique has also been applied to help determine the  form factors@xcite , and a single pole ansatz , with no subtractions , has been recently used@xcite . as discussed in sec .  2 , this ansatz is hard to reconcile with leading order hqet , so that @xmath308 corrections play a significant role in determining the form factors by this method .",
    "however , both of these results are in rough agreement with ours .    as part of a self consistency check on the perturbative part of our analysis , we find the @xmath1 meson decay constant @xmath309 mev with @xmath310 uncertainty , where the last @xmath282 is the generic uncertainty in the @xmath180 decay constant from qcd sum rules .",
    "while our value of @xmath7 is _ not _ directly correlated to this value , since we fix the normalization of our form factors from experiment , this value does indicate that the perturbative qcd calculation is correctly estimating the exclusive decay rate at large meson - meson recoil .",

    "we are particularly grateful to ben grinstein for stimulating our interest in this calculation and for many useful discussions .",
