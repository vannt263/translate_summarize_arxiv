    "entanglement is an important resource in quantum information processing and quantum enabled technologies @xcite . besides its important applications in relatively simple systems , that can be described in terms of a few effective quantum variables ,",
    "it is also widely investigated in many - body systems @xcite , where the bipartite entanglement can be given a satisfactory quantitative definition in terms of entropy and its linearized versions , such as purity @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the global features of entanglement is more involved , unveiling in general different features of the many - body wave function @xcite , and it is becoming clear that the multipartite entanglement of a large system can not be fully characterized in terms of a single ( or a few ) measure(s ) .",
    "entanglement measures the nonclassical correlations between the different components of a quantum system and unearths different characteristics of its many - body wave - function .",
    "when the quantum system is large , it becomes therefore interesting to scrutinize the features of the distribution of some bipartite entanglement measure , such as the purity or the von neumann entropy . besides being of interest for applications ,",
    "this is an interesting problem in statistical mechanics . in @xcite",
    "we tackled this problem by studying a random matrix model that describes the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 ( the complementary subsystem @xmath2 having the same dimension as @xmath0 ) . in the limit of large system dimension @xmath1",
    ", we introduced a partition function for the canonical ensemble as a function of a fictitious temperature .",
    "the role of energy is played by purity : different temperatures correspond to different entanglement .",
    "the most important result of our analysis was the proof that the different regions of entanglement , corresponding to different ranges of the fictitious temperature , are separated by phase transitions .",
    "one puzzle was left open in that paper : in the region of negative temperatures our solution suddenly ceased to exist at a critical @xmath3 where the average purity of subsytem @xmath0 was @xmath4 ( a phenomenon quite common in random matrix theory , as this critical point corresponds to tesselations of random surfaces , or 2-d quantum gravity ) .",
    "as the partition function exists for all @xmath5 , the region of factorizable states , where @xmath6 , was not covered .    we will show in this paper that the solution in @xcite becomes metastable for any @xmath7 ( in the scaling of @xcite ) and a new stable solution appears which interpolates smoothly from @xmath8 to @xmath9 as @xmath10 goes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we will also study the metastable solution that is born at @xmath13 and follow it through the region @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : introductionstatisticalapproach ] we introduce the notation and set the bases of the statistical mechanical approach to the problem . in sec .",

    "we start off by describing a statistical approach to the study of bipartite entanglement for large quantum systems .",
    "we will tackle this problem by introducing a partition function @xcite .",
    "consider a bipartite system , composed of two subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the total system lives in the tensor product hilbert space @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the system is in a pure state @xmath17 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath0 reads @xmath18 and is a hermitian , positive , unit - trace @xmath19 matrix .",
    "a good measure of the entanglement between the two subsystems is given by the purity @xmath20 , \\label{eq : purityn}\\ ] ] whose minimum is attained when all the eigenvalues @xmath21 are equal to @xmath22 ( completely mixed state and maximal entanglement between the two bipartitions ) , while its maximum ( attained when one eigenvalue is 1 and all others are 0 ) detects a factorized state ( no entanglement ) .    in order to study the statistics of bipartite entanglement for pure quantum states , we consider typical vector states @xmath23 @xcite , sampled according to the unique , unitarily invariant measure .",
    "the significance of this measure can be understood in the following way : consider a reference state vector @xmath24 and a unitary transformation @xmath25 . in the least set of assumptions on @xmath26 ,",
    "the measure is chosen in a unique way , being the only left- and right - invariant haar ( probability ) measure of the unitary group @xmath27 .",
    "the final state @xmath23 will hence be distributed according to the measure mentioned above ( independently of @xmath24 ) .",
    "notice the analogy with the maximum entropy argument in classical statistical mechanics . by tracing over subsystem @xmath2",
    ", this measure induces the following measure over the space of hermitian , positive matrices of unit trace @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the ( positive ) eigenvalues of @xmath30 ( schmidt coefficients ) , we dropped the volume of the @xmath31 group ( which is irrelevant for our purposes ) and @xmath32 is the difference between the dimensions of the hilbert spaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in order to study the statistical behavior of a large bipartite quantum system",
    "we introduce a partition function from which all the thermodynamic quantities , for example the entropy or the free energy , can be computed : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a positive integer ( either 2 or 3 , as we shall see ) and @xmath10 a fictitious temperature  selecting \" different regions of entanglement .",
    "the value of @xmath36 needs to be chosen in order to yield the correct thermodynamic limit as @xmath37 since @xmath38 is the number of degrees of freedom of the matrix @xmath30 . around the maximally entangled states ( for @xmath39 @xcite )",
    "we have @xmath40",

    "since the purity depends only on the eigenvalues of @xmath30 the partition function reads @xmath46 which by introducing a lagrange multiplier for the delta function yields @xmath47 a physical interpretation of the exponent in the integrand of the partition function can be given as follows @xcite : the eigenvalues of @xmath30 can be interpreted as a gas of interacting point charges ( coulomb gas ) at positions @xmath48 s , on the positive half - line and with a quadratic potential .",
    "the solution of these integrals is known ( as selberg s integral ) for the case in which the integration limits are @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the constraint of the positivity of the eigenvalues makes the computation of this integral far more complicated .",
    "although a exact solution for finite @xmath1 is unlikely to be found grow enormously in complexity with increasing @xmath1 . ]",
    "( but see @xcite for the first few moments ) , the problem arising from the constraint on the positivity of the eigenvalues can be overcome in the large @xmath1 limit , as we will look for the stationary point of the exponent with respect to both the @xmath50 s and @xmath51 . in particular",
    ", the contour of integration for @xmath51 lies on the real axis , but we will soon see that the saddle point for @xmath51 lies on the imaginary @xmath51 axis .",
    "it is then understood that the contour needs to be deformed to pass by this point parallel to the line of steepest descent . for the saddle point",
    "we need to find the minimum of the free energy : @xmath52 by varying @xmath53 we find the saddle point equations @xmath54 in the following sections we will separately analyze the range of positive and negative temperatures , and unveil the presence of two phase transitions for the system , a second order one at a positive critical @xmath10 and a first order one at a negative critical @xmath10 .      before proceeding to a formal analysis of the phase transitions , it is convenient to give a qualitative picture of the behavior of the schmidt coefficients as the temperature is changed . as the inverse temperature is decreased , the density matrix of subsystem @xmath0 changes as follows . as @xmath55 all eigenvalues are @xmath56 ( maximally mixed state ) . as @xmath10 decreases , we encounter two phase transitions : one at a positive critical value @xmath57 and one at a negative critical value @xmath58 , both critical values being to be determined . for @xmath59",
    "all eigenvalues remain @xmath60 , their distribution being characterized , as we shall see , by the wigner semicircle law . after the first phase transition , for @xmath61 , the eigenvalues , all always @xmath60 , follow the wishart distribution , divergent at the origin .",
