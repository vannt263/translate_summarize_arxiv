    "new multiple access technique , i.e. , non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) , which allow multiple concurrent communications , has been recognized as one of most efficient solutions to fulfill these requirements @xcite . recently , several non - orthogonal code division multiple access ( cdma ) schemes , named sparsely spread code division multiple access ( scdma ) @xcite@xcite , low - density spreading @xcite@xcite , and sparse code multiple access @xcite , have been developed for multiple access channels .",
    "all of these techniques rely on sparse signature sequences and near - optimal joint multi - user belief prorogation ( bp ) detections on sparse graphs .",
    "we collectively call these techniques scdma",
    ". it has demonstrated many advantages with respect to the capacity load and detection complexity over the conventional dense cdma and orthogonal multiple access schemes .    in the downlink of a general scdma system",
    ", a base station simultaneously communicates with multiple users .",
    "data streams for the multiple users are first spread ( encoded ) into vectors by multiplying their signature sequences , which are sparse and the elements are usually selected from a given alphabet set .",
    "multiple data streams after spreading are superimposed at the base station and broadcasted to the users over a common channel , i.e. , using the common resources such as time and frequency .",
    "a multi - user bp detection is performed at each user to recover the data streams .",
    "the performance of scdma detection is mainly determined by a signature matrix that consists of all the users signature sequences as its row vectors .",
    "generally , the signature matrix should have a good sparsity , i.e. , without short cycles in the formed factor graph , to achieve a good bp detection performance .",
    "theoretically , if its factor graph has no cycles , the bp detection converges to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) detection performance @xcite .",
    "moreover , the equivalent signal constellation after spreading and superposition should have large euclidean distance which ultimately determines the performance bound of ml detection .",
    "this motivates us to design the elements in the signature matrix in scdma .",
    "signature design has been investigated for dense spreading in conventional cdma @xcite , where an orthogonal or low - correlated sequence set are constructed to maximize an equivalent cdma channel capacity .",
    "the problem becomes more complex for sparse spreading in scdma since the design should be implemented under the sparsity constraint of the signature matrix .",
    "the problem becomes even more difficult when a two - dimensional modulation scheme is employed as in the scenarios of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "works @xcite and @xcite show that a user constellation rotation significantly affects detection performance of multi - user superposition codes .",
    "convolutional code is employed for each user in @xcite @xcite and the multiple access scheme is referred to as trellis code multiple access ( tcma ) , which can be regarded as a spatial case of the scenarios in @xcite and @xcite with unitary spreading length .",

    ". however , many open research problems , including how to efficiently find an optimal signature matrix with the maximum minimum code distance for an scdma system , how to efficiently estimate the ml detection performance , and how to design signature matrix that works well under both ml and bp detections , are still yet to be resolved .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a general scdma system with a two - dimensional quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) and give a theoretical framework for signature design .",

    "we design the optimal signature matrix with the maximum minimum code distance .",
    "we construct two scdma code families whose factor graphs have very few short cycles .",
    "the constructed scdma codes outperform the existing codes in terms of both word error rate ( wer ) performance and detection complexity .",
    "our numerical results show that their bp detections exactly converge to their ml detection performances with few iterations .",
