    "it is well known that inflation presents most compelling solution of many problems of big bang model , namely the horizon , flatness , homogeneity and monopoles problems @xcite .",
    "the most fascinating feature of inflationary universe model is that it interprets the origin of observed anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiations , and also the distribution of large scale structures @xcite .",
    "but some questions arises in theory of inflation , one of them is how to end this inflationary epoch and enter in bing bang phase .",
    "warm inflation provides a possible solution to this problem .",
    "standard inflation known as cold inflation , has two regimes slow roll and reheating . in slow roll limits",
    ", universe expands as potential energy dominates the kinetic energy and interaction of inflation ( scalar field ) with other fields become negligible . in reheating epoch ,",
    "kinetic energy is comparable to potential energy and inflation oscillates around the minimum of its potential while losing its energy to massless particles . after reheating ,",
    "the universe is filled with radiation .",
    "warm inflation provides a mechanism in which reheating is avoided . during the warm inflationary period ,",
    "dissipative effects are important , so that radiation production takes place at the same time as inflationary expansion .",
    "a strong regime in warm inflation is that in which damping effects on inflation dynamics of radiation field are strong , these dissipating effects originates from a friction term which describe the physical process of decay of inflation field into a thermal bath due to its interaction with other field .",

    "warm inflation come to an end when universe heats up and become radiation dominated and gets connected with the big bang scenario @xcite .",
    "in standard inflation density perturbations are generated due to quantum fluctuations associated to the inflation scalar field , which are necessary for the large scale structure formation at the late time in the evolution of the universe .",
