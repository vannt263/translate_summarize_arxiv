    "in the thirteen years that have elapsed since the term `` lyman break galaxy '' ( or lbg ) was coined , samples of galaxies at @xmath124 have increased a thousand - fold .",
    "large surveys , selecting galaxies not only via the break at 912(due mostly to intergalactic hi absorption ) , but also via ly@xmath10  emission , a variety of colour criteria , and sub - mm emission , have given us a broad view of the galaxy population during the epoch when star - formation activity was at its peak in the history of our universe ( see pettini et al .",
    "2008 for a brief review ) .    however , typical galaxies at @xmath14 are faint , with fiducial @xmath15-band magnitude @xmath16 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; reddy et al .",
    "2008 ) , so that , even with the most efficient optical and infrared ( ir ) telescopes and spectrographs currently available , it is only possible to record their spectra with limited resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "until the next generation of 30+m optical / ir telescopes comes into operation , the only strategy at our disposal for studying _ in detail _ the internal properties of normal galaxies at these redshifts is to take advantage of fortuitous alignments with foreground mass concentrations ( massive galaxies or galaxy clusters ) which can provide an order - of - magnitude boost of the flux reaching the earth through gravitational lensing .    for several years",
    ", the archetypal object for this kind of study has been the lyman break galaxy ms1512-cb58 ( or cb58 for short ; yee et al .",

    "1998 ) provided by an intervening galaxy cluster at @xmath18 brings this @xmath19 , @xmath20 , galaxy within reach of high resolution spectroscopy from the ground and has made it the target of extensive observations at wavelengths from the visible to the mm range ( pettini et al .",

    "these studies provided unprecedented clear views of the interstellar medium , young stars , star - formation history , dust , metallicity , kinematics , and many other physical properties of a ` typical ' lbg at @xmath21 .    but how typical is cb58 ?",
    "we know from the work of shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that its ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum is more reddened , and its interstellar absorption lines are stronger , than in an ` average ' lbg .",
    "furthermore , its young age of only 1020myr ( ellingson et al . 1996 ; siana et al .",

    "2006b ) , although it is likely that an older stellar population is present too .",
    "clearly , it is important to study in detail several other similarly bright sources and establish the _ range _ of properties of galaxies at a given cosmic epoch , rather than naively assuming that any particular galaxy is representative of a whole population .",
    "fortunately , the large area of sky surveyed by the _ sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) _ has led to the recent identification of many other examples of highly magnified galaxies ( see , for instance , belokurov et al .",
    "2009 ; kubo et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) . these and other discoveries have spurred a number of follow - up studies ( e.g. smail et al .",

    "to what extent do different metallicity indicators , based on stellar photospheric lines , wind lines from the most massive stars , interstellar absorption lines , and emission lines from hii regions , give consistent answers ? this is an important issue , not only to explore the degree of chemical homogeneity of galaxies undergoing rapid star - formation , but also to clarify the sources of the systematic offsets between different hii region metallicity calibrators , and possibly bring them into better internal agreement ( see , for example , the discussions by pettini 2006 , and kewley & ellison 2008 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) what do the profiles of the interstellar absorption lines tell us about large - scale outflows in actively star - forming galaxies and about the inflow of gas fueling star formation ?",
    "can we see any evidence of the leakage of hydrogen ionizing photons from the sites of star formation into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) which has proved so difficult to detect directly ( e.g. shapley et al .",
    "2006 ; iwata et al .",
    "2009 ) and yet seems to be required by a number of indirect lines of evidence ( e.g. faucher - gigure et al .",
    "2008 ) ?",
    "\\(iii ) can we place limits on possible variations of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) at @xmath123 ?",
    "claims to this effect have certainly been put forward ( e.g. wilkins et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , but the evidence is still controversial ( e.g. reddy & steidel 2009 ) .",

    "recently , hainline et al . (",
    "2009 ) reported observations of several rest - frame optical emission lines formed in the hii regions of the cosmic horseshoe , from which they were able to measure a number of parameters of interest .",

    "the emission line widths indicate a velocity dispersion @xmath43 km  s@xmath3 and a corresponding virial mass @xmath44 .",
    "the oxygen abundance deduced from the ratios of the strongest emission lines is in the range ( o / h)@xmath451.5(o / h)@xmath46 .",
    "these parameters are typical of uv - bright galaxies at @xmath47 ( erb et al . 2006a , b , c ) , although the star formation rate is at the upper end of the distribution of values found by erb et al .",

    "it is of interest now to compare such estimates with those provided by the rest - frame uv spectrum .",

    "make it highly suitable for an in - depth study of the uv spectrum of this galaxy .",
    "the data were collected over two nights ( 2008 march 6 and 7 ut ) in mostly sub - arcsecond seeing ; the total exposure time was 36100s , made up of a number of 1800s or 2000s - long individual integrations .",
    "the esi slit was oriented at sky p.a .",
    "= 10.8 degrees east of north , and positioned so as to encompass the two brightest knots in the einstein ring , as shown in figure  [ fig : horseimage ] . the northern knot , labelled ` aperture 1 ' in the figure , is knot ` a ' in the labelling of the features by belokurov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , while ` aperture 2 ' corresponds to their knot ` d ' .",
    "both knots are due to the same object in the source plane , although ` aperture 1 ' may include a small contribution from the fainter component @xmath39arcsec to the north of the main source of the ring ( dye et al .",
    "the location of the esi slit is the same as that of the nirspec observations by hainline et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the data were processed with standard iraf tasks . each individual two - dimensional ( 2-d ) esi spectrum was geometrically corrected ( to correct for the spectral curvature of each echellette order ) , bias subtracted , flat - fielded , and corrected for cosmetic defects and cosmic - ray affected pixels . in the next step , all of the images thus processed were co - added into a total 2-d frame which was then background subtracted .",
    "the background subtraction process included careful modelling of the distribution along the slit of light from the lens , which is clearly visible above the sky at the longer wavelengths of the esi range .",
    "finally , two 1-d spectra were extracted ( using optimal extraction algorithms ) , one for each ` aperture ' .",
    "the extraction process included merging the 10 echellette orders of esi into one continuous spectrum , with weighted addition of portions of adjacent orders which overlap in wavelength .",
    "we compared carefully the 1-d spectra of aperture 1 and aperture 2 to look for differences which one may expect to be revealed by the gravitational magnification of any spatial structure in the source , but found none .",
    "neither dividing one spectrum by the other nor subtracting one from the other revealed features more significant than the noise . as discussed in section  [ sec : lya ] , this is also the case for the ly@xmath10  emission line which ( a ) has the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , and ( b ) is most sensitive to geometrical effects , being resonantly scattered .",
    "the only difference between the two apertures is in the total flux : emission line and continuum are uniformly higher by a factor of 1.19 in aperture 2 than in aperture 1 .",
    "thus , in order to improve the s / n , the two spectra were averaged and the resulting spectrum mapped onto 0.5  bins .",
    "this final spectrum has a resolution ( full width at half maximum ) fwhm=75 km  s@xmath3 , sampled with three wavelength bins at 6000 , as determined from the widths of narrow emission lines from the cu - ar and hg - ne - xe hollow - cathode lamps used for wavelength calibration , whose spectrum was processed in the same way as that of the horseshoe . from the rms deviation of the data from the mean",
    ", we measured an average s / n@xmath49 per 0.5   wavelength bin between @xmath50 and @xmath51(@xmath52 and @xmath53  in the rest frame ) , with a factor of @xmath54% variation in s / n across each echellette order . at the wavelengths of the ly@xmath10  emission line",
    "the s / n rises to a maximum s / n=44 per 0.5  bin .",
    "we attempted to put our spectrum on an absolute flux scale by reference to those of three flux - standard stars recorded during the two nights of observation , but found a scatter of @xmath55% in the flux calibration among the three stars .",
    "adopting the mean value of the three flux scales , we deduced a mean @xmath56erg  s@xmath3  @xmath57  hz@xmath3 between 42005485 .",
    "this wavelength interval corresponds to the fwhm of the transmission curve of the gunn @xmath58 filter through which belokurov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) measured @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath59erg  s@xmath3  @xmath57  hz@xmath3 ) for the entire einstein ring .",
    "thus , if the flux calibration is correct , the esi slit captured a fraction @xmath60 of the light of the cosmic horseshoe , corresponding to an effective magnitude within the two apertures of @xmath61 .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectra of star - forming galaxies are complex blends of interstellar absorption lines , nebular emission lines , and absorption / emission lines formed in the atmospheres of ob stars .",
    "this wealth of spectral features , properly interpreted , is a rich source of information on the physical properties of the gas and stars in these galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we consider photospheric absorption lines which have been shown to be useful abundance diagnostics , and p - cygni profiles formed in the expanding atmospheres of the most luminous early - type stars whose strength is also sensitive to the upper end of the initial mass function .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the determination of the systemic redshift of the galaxy . while most photospheric features are unresolved blends of multiple lines , a few exceptions allow the redshift of the hot stars to be determined . within the wavelength range covered by our data , we identified the following unblended photospheric absorption lines : sv@xmath62 , niv@xmath63 , and ciii@xmath64 [ @xmath65all three vacuum wavelengths from the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) database available at http://physics.nist.gov/physrefdata/asd/ ] .",
    "the redshifts of these three lines are in good mutual agreement ( see table  [ table : systemic_z ] ) , and define an average @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 error corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath68 km  s@xmath3 , or 1/5 of a wavelength bin in our final spectrum .",
    "also included in table  [ table : systemic_z ] are values of @xmath69 from the ciii]@xmath70 doublet lines which are resolved in our esi spectrum ( see section  [ sec : ciii ] ) , and from h@xmath10 measured from the nirspec spectrum of hainline et al .",
    "the mean @xmath71 } = 2.38115 \\pm 0.00012 $ ] is in excellent agreement with @xmath72 ; @xmath73 differs by only 7 km  s@xmath3 which may include a small systematic offset between the wavelength calibrations of the esi and nirspec spectra .",
    "thus , we conclude that the systemic redshift of the cosmic horseshoe is @xmath74 and we adopt this value throughout the paper .      in this and the following subsection",
    ", we analyse photospheric and wind lines in the spectrum of the cosmic horseshoe by comparing our data with model spectra computed with the population synthesis code _ starburst99 _ which couples libraries of either empirical ( leitherer et al . 1999 , 2001 ) or theoretical ( rix et al . 2004 )",

    "the input set of parameters to _ starburst99 _ can be adjusted to simulate a variety of star formation histories , ages , imf parameters , and metallicities so as to determine the combination that best fits the observations under scrutiny .        in the absence of more detailed information on the previous history of star formation in the cosmic horseshoe",
    ", we shall adopt the simplest case of continuous star formation  with a salpeter slope of the upper end of the imf  which has been proceeding at a steady rate ( as opposed to a declining rate , or a series of bursts ) for 100myr ( this being a safe lower limit beyond which the spectrum no longer changes with time because the stars that contribute to the uv light are born and die at the same rate ) .",
    "while this scenario is undoubtedly an over - simplification , it may not be too different from reality when considering the spectrum of a whole galaxy , rather than individual regions of star formation .",
    "an age of more than 100myr is typical of most @xmath12 uv - bright galaxies in the ` bx ' sample of erb et al .",

    "both indices stabilise after @xmath54myr from the onset of star formation , and increase monotonically with metallicity . in the left - hand portion of figure  [ fig : rixindices ]",

    "there is a startling similarity in this spectral region between these two galaxies which are at different redshifts ( cb58 is at @xmath99 ) and were selected randomly , only by virtue of the fact that they are highly lensed as seen from earth ( although they are both more luminous than the ` average ' galaxy at these redshifts , even after correcting for the lensing magnifications ) . presumably , not only the chemical abundances , but also the young stellar populations of these two galaxies are remarkably similar .",
    "only the interstellar absorption lines are different , with those in cb58 apparently stronger than in the cosmic horseshoe ( but see the discussion in section  [ sec : ism ] ) .",
    "the p - cygni component of the civ complex is due to the most massive ( and luminous ) o stars , which drive the strongest winds . on the other hand , a wider range of stellar spectral types , including all stars with masses greater than about @xmath100 ,",

    "rix et al .",
    "thus , the contrast of the p - cygni features relative to the continuum is sensitive not only to metallicity , but also to the slope and upper end cut - off of the imf , as well as to more subtle effects , such as differential dust extinction among stars at the upper end of the imf ( the most massive and short - lived stars may in principle be more reddened than longer lived ones ",

    "clearly , the same conclusion applies here to the massive stellar population in the cosmic horseshoe .",
    "more generally , the similarity evident in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : civ ] suggests that the minor effects discussed above ( differential dust extinction and the balance between cluster and field stars ) presumably average out in at least a subset of star - forming galaxies at @xmath102 , when their integrated spectra are considered .        summarising the conclusions of this section , we find that the metallicity of the early - type stars in the cosmic horseshoe is approximately half - solar , from consideration of photospheric and wind absorption lines .",

    "the values of @xmath106 listed in column ( 4 ) of table  [ tab : ism ] are those derived from the centroids of the lines ( that is , the mean wavelength of the line weighted by the absorption in each wavelength bin ) ; their mean value is @xmath107 which corresponds to a velocity offset @xmath108 km  s@xmath3 with respect to the stars .",
    "we also measured the redshift at the peak optical depth in the most clearly defined line profiles and found a mean @xmath109 ( @xmath110 km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this net blueshift of the interstellar lines is a common feature of star - forming galaxies at low ( e.g. heckman et al . 2000 ; martin 2005 ) as well as high ( e.g. pettini et al . 2001 ; shapley et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies may offer insights into the factors that control @xmath120 . by fully resolving the interstellar absorption lines in our esi spectrum of the cosmic horseshoe",
    ", we reached the conclusion that the interstellar gas only covers @xmath9% of the stellar uv light , as viewed from earth .",
    "this is a promising prerequisite for large values of @xmath120 , making the horseshoe a high priority candidate in searches for lyc emission from high-@xmath13 galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath122% of the photons from the stars and surrounding hii regions really had a clear path out of the galaxy , we may have expected to see a strong and narrow ly@xmath10  emission line centred at @xmath69 , whereas no such feature is present in our spectrum .",
    "possibly , some 40% of the stars are located behind neutral gas of too low a column density to give discernible absorption in the metal lines , and yet capable of scattering most of the ly@xmath10   photons out of the line of sight ( hansen & oh 2006 ) . whether such gas would be optically thick to lyc photons remains to be established .",
    "another necessary condition for the escape of lyc photons is a weaker h@xmath10 emission line than expected on the basis of the uv continuum luminosity and reddening ( admittedly in the idealised case of continuous star formation at a constant rate ) .",
    "such a disparity would arise from a ` matter - bounded nebula ' , where not all of the lyc photons emitted by the stars are absorbed and reprocessed within the hii region . as discussed in section  [ sec : f_esc ] , in the cosmic horseshoe sfr(h@xmath123sfr(uv ) , although a number of different factors , apart from leakage of lyc photons , can affect this comparison . in conclusion",
    ", it would definitely be worthwhile to search for lyc emission in the cosmic horseshoe at wavelengths below 3085  ( the redshifted value of the lyman limit at @xmath0 ) .",
    "furthermore , it would be of interest to check for partial covering of the stars by the foreground interstellar medium in more galaxies among the newly discovered strongly lensed sources , ideally including galaxies with a range of ly@xmath10   equivalent widths . with such data in hand , we should be in a better position to understand the conditions that determine the escape fraction of lyc photons and the morphology of the ly@xmath10  line .",
    "one of the motivations for the present study was to establish how typical are the properties of the galaxy ms1512-cb58 , the only previous case where the gravitational lensing boost was sufficient to allow a detailed look at the spectrum of a high - redshift star - forming galaxy .",
    "while we have now doubled the ` sample ' of high-@xmath13 galaxies with good - quality esi spectra , it would clearly be premature to draw general conclusions on the basis of just two objects .",
    "nevertheless , one can not help but being struck by how closely these two galaxies resemble each other in many of their properties .",
    "they are very similar in their overall metallicity and probably in their detailed chemical composition , indicating that they have reached comparable stages in the conversion of their gas reservoirs into stars .",
    "their young stellar populations are largely indistinguishable in their uv spectral features , especially the p - cygni lines which are sensitive indicators of the mode of massive star formation and of differential reddening among stars at the upper end of the imf .",
    "most remarkable perhaps is the unexpected similarity in the properties of their outflowing interstellar media , with velocities spanning in both cases @xmath124 km  s@xmath3 , from @xmath8 to @xmath104 km  s@xmath3 relative to the stars , and involving comparable column densities of gas .",
    "presumably , it is just a coincidence that the first two galaxies at @xmath123 whose uv spectra have been put under the ` microscope ' of gravitational lensing have also turned out to be similar in so many respects .",
    "after all , we now know that the cosmic horseshoe and ms1512-cb58 are also forming stars at comparable rates of @xmath54@xmath125  yr@xmath3 , and have similar dynamical masses of @xmath126 ( hainline et al .",
    "2009 for these measurements in the cosmic horseshoe and teplitz et al .",
    "2000 for cb58 ) .",
    "future studies of other gravitationally lensed objects will arguably show a wider range of properties of star - forming galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "what is interesting then , given the underlying similarity of the horseshoe and cb58 , is to consider the aspects in which they _ differ _ : the incomplete coverage of the stellar light by the interstellar absorption lines and the strikingly different ly@xmath10  morphologies .",
    "it is these two factors alone that would lead an observer to ` classify ' the two galaxies differently .",
    "for example , in the rough breakdown of lbgs by shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) according to their uv spectral properties , cb58 would fall in the quartile with the highest interstellar absorption line equivalent widths and reddening , while the cosmic horseshoe would be in the quartile with the second highest ly@xmath10  _ emission _ equivalent width . and",
    "yet , from what we have uncovered in the present study , it may be the case that these differences are perhaps simply due to orientation effects  viewing two intrinsically similar galaxies along differing sightlines through their interstellar media , one ( the horseshoe ) more rarefied and highly ionized than the other ( cb58 ) . with future studies of other strongly lensed galaxies",
    "we shall hopefully learn how to distinguish intrinsic differences from those caused by second - order effects , of which the direction from which we view the central starburst may be one example . for the moment , however , we must remain cautious of overinterpreting differences between different ` classes ' of high - redshift galaxies , especially if such distinctions are based on the morphology and strength of the ly@xmath10  line , whose appearance is so sensitive to a variety of different parameters ( e.g. pentericci et al .",
    "we have presented esi observations of the rest - frame ultraviolet spectrum of a star - forming galaxy at @xmath0 , lensed by a massive foreground galaxy into a nearly complete einstein ring dubbed the ` cosmic horseshoe ' .",
    "the high gravitational magnification affords the rare opportunity of recording the spectrum of this member of the @xmath123 galaxy population at higher resolution and s / n than otherwise achievable , and thereby provides us with a close - up look of a galaxy during the epoch when cosmic star - formation activity was at its peak .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the cosmic horseshoe shares many of its properties with the population of ` bx ' galaxies selected with the colour criteria of steidel et al .",
    "its metallicity @xmath127 , dynamical mass @xmath4 , and reddening @xmath5 are all typical of those galaxies ( erb et al . 2006a , b , c ) .",
    "with a star - formation rate sfr@xmath128  yr@xmath3 , the horseshoe is among the most luminous galaxies in the bx sample .",
    "\\(ii ) generally , there is good agreement between different metallicity indicators based , respectively , on ratios of strong nebular emission lines , on blends of stellar photospheric lines , and on p - cygni lines from the most luminous ob stars .",
    "the @xmath129 index of pagel et al .",
    "( 1979 ) seems to overpredict the oxygen abundance by a factor of @xmath130 , when calibrated with the prescription by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . of the stellar measures , the 1978 index of rix et al . (",
    "2004 ) does not fit the data well due to excess absorption not present in the models and whose identity remains unclear .",
    "\\(iii ) a continuous mode of star formation with a salpeter slope for stars with masses @xmath131 gives a good representation of the uv spectrum ; we see no evidence for a departure from a salpeter imf , nor differential reddening among massive stars , in the contrast of the p - cygni lines over the underlying uv continuum .",
    "\\(iv ) the interstellar absorption lines are broad , extending over a velocity interval of @xmath124 km  s@xmath3 , from @xmath8 to @xmath104 km  s@xmath3 relative to the redshift of the stars and hii regions .",
    "the gas with the highest optical depths is outflowing from the regions of star formation with a speed of @xmath132 km  s@xmath3 , and only covers @xmath9% of the stellar continuum light .",
    "\\(v ) the ly@xmath10  line is in emission and shares many of the properties of the so - called ly@xmath10  emitters , although its equivalent width is a factor of @xmath133 smaller than the lower limit @xmath134commonly adopted to define this subset of galaxies .",
    "the resolved line profile matches well those computed with models of resonantly scattered ly@xmath10  photons in an expanding medium , although such models find it difficult to account for the fact that the velocity dispersion of the gas is comparable to its bulk expansion velocity , and for the existence of gas extending over hundreds of km  s@xmath3 in velocity space .",
    "some @xmath1115% of the ly@xmath10  photons produced escape the galaxy , the remainder presumably being absorbed by dust and recycled into infrared photons , or scattered over a larger area than that covered by our narrow - slit observations .",
    "it remains to be established what fraction of the lyman _",
    "photons emitted by the stars leak into the igm .",
    "\\(vi ) overall , many of the physical properties of the stars and interstellar medium of the cosmic horseshoe are similar to those of the only other galaxy previously studied at comparable resolution and s / n , ms1512-cb58 at @xmath20 .",
    "this may not be surprising , given that both galaxies are fairly typical examples of the star - forming galaxy population at these redshifts .",
    "the fundamental similarities between the two objects highlight the fact that the aspects in which they differ , particularly the very different morphologies of their ly@xmath10lines , may be due to superficial reasons , such as differing viewing angles , rather than to more deeply rooted causes .    in the near future it should be possible to make further progress on all of these topics with the increasing numbers of strongly lensed high - redshift galaxies being discovered by the _ sdss _ and other lensing surveys .",
    "we are grateful to the staff at the w.  m. keck observatory for their competent assistance with the observations , to sam rix and dan nestor who generously provided some of the software used in the analysis of the spectra , and to simon dye for clarifications concerning the lensing models .",
