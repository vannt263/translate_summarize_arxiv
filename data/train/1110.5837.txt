    "the axion is a pseudo - goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of the global axial peccei - quinn @xmath0 symmetry proposed to solve the strong cp problem  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian relevant for this work includes only their coupling to photons @xmath1 considering couplings to electrons and other leptons changes only slightly our conclusions .",
    "the mass and the photon coupling are calculable in chiral perturbation theory as  @xcite , @xmath2 and are related to each other via @xmath3 , a free @xmath4 parameter .",
    "the two - photon coupling allows the decay @xmath5 , at the rate @xmath6    the two photon coupling allows to axions thermalize in the early universe via the primakoff process @xmath7 .",
    "however , at some temperature axions decouple .",
    "additional axion interactions with pions or electrons can lower the decoupling temperature , but are not relevant for this discussion .",
    "this thermal axion population behaves as hot dark matter , which is currently disfavoured , implying the constraint @xmath8 ev  @xcite .    the axion lifetime @xmath9 becomes shorter than the age of the universe if the mass exceeds @xmath10 ev and the above bound looses his meaning .",
    "we have therefore explored the possibility that , above a certain mass , the axion could disappear from the universe without leaving any observable trace  @xcite .",
    "still , the decay of axions would affect bbn , the neutrino temperature and the cmb .",
    "the exquisite precision of cosmological data sets permits to constrain the axion parameters .",
    "all in all , we found that axions are allowed by cosmology to have @xmath11 kev  @xcite .",
    "these cosmological limits become even more interesting in the case of axion - like particles ( alps ) : pseudo - scalars having similar properties of the axion except the relation between the mass and the photon coupling , which are now free to span the whole parameter space  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite , we have extended to alps the axion cosmological bounds we found in  @xcite .",
    "the summary of the constraints we found is in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , together with some other relevant cosmological and astrophysical bounds .",
    "the most interesting bounds arise because of the entropy released during the decay . as the decay products are photons ( and in some axion models also electrons ) , _ this entropy is shared only among the species in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic radiation_. if axions or alps decay when inverse reactions are efficient , @xmath12 , they do it in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "this is the case if alps decay when the temperature exceeds greatly their mass .",
    "the raise in entropy follows from entropy conservation by counting the relevant relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath13 before and after the disappearance , like one usually does for the @xmath14 annihilation .",
    "for instance , if axions or alps decay affects only photons , the photon entropy is increased by a factor @xmath15 .",
    "the other extreme possibility is that the temperature is smaller than the mass when axions or alps decay , which implies far out - of - equilibrium decay . in this case",
    "the energy density in scalars can even dominate the universe expansion thrusting in a huge amount of entropy . in this case",
    ", one finds  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of alps per photon before the decay . solving the boltzmann equations we exactly calculated the entropy emitted during the decay and how this influences the thermodynamics of the other species .",
    "if axions or alps decay after the decoupling of neutrinos , the latter can not be heated by the radiation released and the final ratio @xmath18 would be lower than the standard value @xmath19 .",
    "the number of effective neutrinos is defined as @xmath20 to measure the neutrino energy density . from wmap7 ,",
    "the 7th release of the ssds and the measurement of @xmath21 by the hst , we obtained the following limits on @xmath22  @xcite @xmath23 assuming a prior @xmath24 because we assume only @xmath25 standard neutrinos and in the alp decay scenario sketched the alp decay can only increase @xmath26 , i.e. lower @xmath22 .",
    "we plot our results in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] in the alp mass and lifetime plane .",
    "axion models with @xmath27 lie along the steep line labelled ksvz .",
    "[ fig:1 ]     [ fig:2 ]",
    "the photons emitted in alp decays decrease the baryon to photon ratio @xmath28 , which is well measured from cmb to be @xmath29 .",
    "this value agrees with what inferred from standard bbn .",
    "if a relic population decays before the cmb release but after bbn it means bbn happened with a higher @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath30 . the lte value @xmath31 is enough to create a disagreement between bbn simulations and the observation of primordial elements .",
    "alps with longer lifetimes decay increasingly out - of - equilibrium and rise the tension , unless a decrease in @xmath17 compensates the growth of @xmath32 , c.f .",
    "( the sharp features of our results correspond to the large decrease in @xmath17 when alps decouple around the qcd phase transition ) .",
    "deuterium is the most affected nucleus in a high @xmath28 bbn , where it can be more efficiently processed into heavier elements : it is the best observable to test @xmath33 .",
    "values of @xmath34 are presently excluded at 99% c.l . , which allows only axions with mass larger than @xmath35 kev  @xcite .",
    "the results for the alp case are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : bbn ] .",
    "higher mass alps initiate em and hadronic showers , which dissociate nuclei .",
    "also alps decays produce charged pions , whose presence alters the neutron / proton equilibrium . in general",
    ", they enhance @xmath36 , which can even reach values @xmath37 1 .",
    "this translates into high he and d / h yields  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 , d and he limits are presently the most constraining ones for shorter alp lifetimes ."
