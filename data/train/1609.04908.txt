    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) predicted to have existed in the early universe can be reproduced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and the lhc .",
    "highly energetic particles and jets that traverse the hot and dense qcd medium are powerful and valuable probes of this new state of matter .",
    "in particular , open heavy flavor production is playing a crucial role in elucidating the properties of qgp and has received growing attention from the experimental and theoretical communities in recent years .",
    "the experimental collaborations cms and alice at the lhc have provided high precision data , see e.g.  @xcite , for the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 for both light and heavy mesons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "interestingly , preliminary results from the cms collaboration  @xcite taken at @xmath4  tev show that the suppression rate for @xmath5 mesons is the same as that for light charged hadrons within the experimental uncertainty , contrary to the early expectation  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on heavy flavor production , see @xcite .    in this work , based on recently developed techniques using soft collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite , we present new theoretical calculations for heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions beyond the traditional framework of parton energy loss  @xcite . in order to describe highly energetic",
    "_ massless _",
    "partons traversing the qcd medium , an effective field theory based on scet was developed in  @xcite , which describes the interaction of energetic partons with the qgp through the exchange of glauber gluons and dubbed `` scet@xmath6 '' .",
    "the main purpose of the current work is to extend this calculation and include the finite mass effect for heavy quarks",
    ". the resulting new effective field theory will be labeled as scet@xmath7 , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "glauber modes within scet in a more general context were also discussed in  @xcite .    following the massless calculations in  @xcite",
    ", we derive massive in - medium splitting functions to first order in opacity within the framework of scet@xmath7 . with the new in - medium splitting functions , we are able to go beyond the traditional approach to parton energy loss for heavy meson production in heavy ion collisions , similar to our previous work for light flavor production  @xcite . in addition",
    ", we introduce a new way of implementing the in - medium corrections consistently at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd  @xcite for inclusive hadron production .",
    "this can be achieved by formally defining medium modified fragmentation functions derived from the scet@xmath7 splitting functions . as it turns out , the description of the underlying proton - proton baseline plays an important role  @xcite .",
    "the scet@xmath7 lagrangian is given by a sum of the massive scet lagrangian in the vacuum  @xcite and the glauber gluon interaction terms as in the massless case  @xcite .",
    "the medium interaction terms are not modified due to the finite mass effects , which can be obtained from power counting , see  @xcite for more details . from the resulting lagrangian , we can directly derive the massive vacuum splitting functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which were first obtained using traditional perturbative methods in qcd  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the in - medium results are obtained by taking into account single- and double - born diagrams and by summing over the number of scattering centers .",
    "as it turns out , the in - medium splitting functions have a similar structure as the massless results in  @xcite .",
    "since the final expressions are quite lengthy , we refer the interested reader to  @xcite . in the soft emission limit ,",
    "it is possible to reproduce the splitting functions obtained in traditional energy loss calculations for heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "medium - induced parton splitting in the qgp will modify the production rate of the final - state hadron .",
    "the relevant part of the cross section for a fragmenting quark or gluon @xmath12 can be schematically written as [ eq : mednlo ] _ j^(0)_i _",
    "ijk d_j^h , where @xmath13 is the leading - order production cross section for quarks or gluons .",
    "the @xmath14 describe the splitting process @xmath15 and are given by the sum of vacuum and in - medium splitting functions [ eq : vac+med ] p_ijk(z,)=p^_ijk(z,)+p^_ijk(z , ) , where one has to consider both real and virtual corrections for the splitting  @xcite . the first term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mednlo ] ) and ( [ eq : vac+med ] ) is simply part of the nlo calculation in the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the second term gives the fixed order in - medium correction and can be formally considered as a medium modified fragmentation function .",
    "see  @xcite for a more detailed derivation",
    ". with @xmath16 derived from scet@xmath7 , one can then study the medium modification of heavy meson production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in this section , we present results for the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 for heavy meson production in heavy ion collisions at the lhc , @xmath17 , r_aa = d^h_/ddp_t d^h_pp / ddp_t , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the produced heavy meson , and @xmath20 is the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions for a given centrality .",
    "note that for the proton - proton baseline , we choose to use the zero mass variable number scheme ( zmvfns ) at nlo and the fragmentation functions of  @xcite .",
    "we find that this scheme can be applicable to relatively low @xmath19 of the observed hadron @xmath21 , and gives a good description of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson cross section in @xmath22 collisions at the lhc around midrapidity . for our numerical results below",
    ", we do not take into account cold nuclear matter effects , which are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "first , we present a comparison between our results achieved within scet@xmath7 and those obtained from the traditional energy loss approach in fig .  [",
    "fig : raa - a ] .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa - b ] we compare our scet@xmath7 results to preliminary cms data for @xmath5 mesons  @xcite ( left ) at @xmath2  tev .",
    "overall , we find good agreement with the data .",
    "non - prompt @xmath23 originating from @xmath1-hadrons  @xcite ( right ) at @xmath24 tev is available only as minimum bias data instead of fixed centrality .",
    "we overlay our @xmath1-meson calculation for central and mid - peripheral collisions .",
    "we note that the heavy - ion results crucially depend on whether the heavy meson is produced by a fragmenting heavy quark or a gluon  @xcite . within the zmvfns",
    ", gluon fragmentation can play a dominant role for the heavy meson production in both @xmath22 and @xmath25 collisions , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "we derived a new version of soft collinear effective theory , which describes the interaction of collinear heavy quarks with the medium through glauber gluon exchange  @xcite . from the new effective field theory , we computed the in - medium massive splitting functions for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 to first order in opacity .",
    "in addition , we introduced a new formalism to include in - medium effects consistently at next - to - leading order in qcd .",
    "we further presented numerical results for the suppression of @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons in heavy ion collisions and found good agreement with the recent experimental data from the lhc heavy ion experiments . in the future",
    ", we plan to extend the current framework of the in - medium modification to inclusive jet production  @xcite .",
