    "in quantum information theory the fundamental unit of information is a two - level quantum system , the qubit . as in classical information science with bits , all quantum information tasks can at least in theory be performed through just qubits and quantum gates operating on qubits @xcite . for quantum information purposes and the effective production and processing of robust qubits , as well as that of multi - dimensional quantum states or qudits @xcite , considerable interest has been recently focused on the generation and manipulation of helical laser beams .",
    "these optical waves , which have been shown to carry well - defined values of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , are well described in terms of laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes , containing an @xmath0-charged optical phase singularity ( or optical vortex ) at their beam axis @xcite .",
    "any two of such oam modes with opposite value of @xmath0 and a common radial profile , here denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , define a basis of a bidimensional oam subspace @xmath3 in which one can encode a generic qubit .",
    "these specific oam subspaces are particularly convenient to this purpose as they are not affected by propagation - induced decoherence , because the radial profile factorizes and can be usually ignored @xcite .",
    "experimentally , single - photon qubits in the oam subspace @xmath4 can be efficiently encoded and read - out by means of `` polarization - oam transferrers '' @xcite , which are devices based on a recently introduced optical element called `` q - plate '' @xcite .",
    "the growing number of works demonstrating simple quantum information protocols based on oam - encoded qubits raise questions about how practical is such approach , as compared for instance with the standard polarization encoding .",
    "for example , one can ask how sensitive are these oam - encoded qubits to small optical misalignments or other non - ideality of typical setups .",
    "more in general , studies of the resilience of oam - encoded qubits or qudits in free - space propagation under the effect of perturbations and of imperfect detection are pivotal for the use of the oam of light for quantum communication tasks .",
    "previous works on lg modes in the classical regime showed for example the spread of measured transverse modes when planar restrictions spanning an angular range of less than @xmath5 are placed along the beam @xcite , the consequences of non - coaxial mode detection @xcite , and the effect of turbulence on oam - encoded information @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to characterize the degradation undergone by the information encoded in @xmath4 oam qubits when transverse hard - edged optical apertures are placed along the propagation direction of the beam , both in the classical and quantum regimes .",
    "the apertures considered in this work have one of the two shapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture ] , which are here taken to mimic the typical effect of optical misalignments or of the finite numerical aperture of optical components .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] introduces a classical theoretical model , based on the functional shape of lg modes , used to assess the degradation undergone by states belonging to three different @xmath4 bases as a consequence of the perturbation introduced during propagation by the two kinds of optical apertures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : classicalexperimental ] , we compare the theoretical predictions with the results of experiments performed in the classical regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hybridentanglement ] we finally present the experimental results concerning the effects of the previously introduced obstructions on the entanglement properties of a hybrid polarization - oam entangled pair of twin photons @xcite , that is , a pair of entangled photons whose entanglement is encoded in two different degrees of freedom .",
    "an oam eigenstate @xmath6 is here taken to denote a pure lg mode , corresponding to a wavefunction @xmath7 with azimuthal index @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is the propagation axis , @xmath9 are the cartesian coordinates for the transverse plane , and @xmath10 the corresponding polar coordinates .",
    "lg modes are characterized also by another index @xmath11 , determining the radial profile . in the following , except where explicitly stated otherwise , this radial index is understood to be @xmath12 and will be omitted .",
    "generic oam qubits are described by superpositions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are complex coefficients .",
    "we will consider in particular the following six representative states , belonging to three mutually unbiased bases of the oam subspace @xmath4 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; and @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath22 of these states are given by the corresponding superpositions of pure lg modes .",
    "all input wavefunctions are normalized for integration in any given ( arbitrary ) transverse plane @xmath8 of the beam , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider two sets of optical apertures : ( i ) a half - plane obstruction with its edge located at the variable abscissa @xmath24 , described by the transmittance function @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heaviside step function ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aperturex ] ) ; and ( ii ) an iris with variable aperture radius @xmath27 , described by the transmittance function @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aperturer ] ) . the first kind of aperture is meant to mimic the perturbations arising from small transverse optical misalignments , while the second corresponds to introducing optical elements having a small numerical aperture .",
    "beam ( basis state  @xmath29 ) through a @xmath30 aperture function with @xmath31 .",
    "profiles are drawn to the same scale . from left to right : ( a ) unperturbed transverse intensity profile ; ( b ) intensity profile immediately after the aperture function ( 0.01 nm from the obstruction ) ; ( c ) calculated profile after free - space propagation of the perturbed mode for @xmath32 cm after the obstruction ; ( d ) calculated profile after the insertion of a q - plate optical element ( see ref.@xcite ) , used for the conversion into a @xmath33 mode after the propagation of @xmath32 cm . ]",
    "now , given an arbitrary input qubit @xmath34 as described by the wavefunction @xmath35 , the perturbed state @xmath36 obtained immediately after the aperture is given by a ( not normalized ) wavefunction @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : bprop]a - b ) . given the normalization of the input wavefunction ,",
    "the transmitted fraction of photons after the aperture is given by @xmath39 .",
    "we then introduce the following two projections :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the wavefunction of the orthogonal state within the @xmath4 oam subspace ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "we take the final detection probability of states @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . therefore , @xmath46 represents the probability of information preservation in the oam subspace @xmath4 ( with @xmath12 ) after the initial mode has been transmitted through the aperture .",
    "the complementary fraction @xmath47 of photons is lost either because they are absorbed in the aperture ( as given by the fraction @xmath48 ) or because they are transferred out of the @xmath4 @xmath12 subspace , and therefore are finally filtered out by the measurement process ( note that this implies that the detection optics is assumed to have a small numerical aperture , thus strongly favoring @xmath12 over higher radial modes ) .",
    "the computed oam spectrum broadening induced by the planar aperture ( function @xmath49 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , for different positions of the aperture as specified by the resulting transmittance @xmath50 .",
    "+    the detected photons , however , will transport a partially degraded oam qubit .",
    "the amount of quantum information content that can be reconstructed by a receiver by means of projective measurements can be described through a fidelity parameter @xmath51 defined as @xmath52 $ ] .    for each oam state @xmath34 , and each position @xmath24 ( or radius @xmath27 ) of the obstruction , the probabilities @xmath53 and @xmath54 were computed using numerical integration .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the information preservation probability @xmath55 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotsthb ] , together with the corresponding mode profiles .",
    "+    the computed mean information preservation probability @xmath55 and fidelity @xmath51 for the aperture function @xmath30 , averaged over the six oam states , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotsb ] as solid lines .",
    "the mean @xmath55 relative to the aperture function @xmath56 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotrp ] .",
    "the theoretical fidelity in this second case is constantly unitary , because the rotational symmetry is not broken by the aperture .",
    "classical measurements were performed on coherent beams by generating the oam modes in @xmath4 corresponding to the six states ( @xmath29 , @xmath57 ) , ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , and then placing either a knife ( aperture function @xmath49 ) or an iris ( function @xmath62 ) along the beam path .",
    "the perturbed modes @xmath36 were then projected onto @xmath34 and @xmath63 by the analysis setup .",
    "we assumed that no significant degradation ( except possibly for some additional small losses ) occurs to the quantum information in the analysis setup .    in the experimental implementation ,",
    "a continuous laser beam was coupled to a single - mode fiber in order to collapse its transverse spatial mode into a pure @xmath33 , corresponding to oam @xmath64 .",
    "after the fiber , a polarization set was used to prepare the input polarization state as one of the six qubits .",
    "the beam was then sent through a quantum transferrer @xmath65 , which transferred the polarization quantum state to the oam degree of freedom , thus obtaining one of the input oam state to be studied @xcite . in order to analyze with high efficiency the oam state after the aperture",
    ", we then exploited an inverse @xmath66 transferrer and a polarization analysis set @xcite .",
    "the inverse transferrer includes the coupling to a single - mode fiber , which in our case was achieved with a typical efficiency @xmath67 .",
    "although the q - plate device used in the transferrers is known to generate a radial profile more complex than a pure lg mode @xcite , only the @xmath12 radial modes will be efficiently coupled to the final single - mode fiber used in our analysis setup , so that the @xmath12 assumption used in our theory appears to be well justified .",
    "the experimental average data for aperture @xmath49 and states @xmath60 and @xmath61 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotsb ] , those for @xmath62 and all @xmath4 basis states in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotrp ] .     +     +    a comparison between the theoretical curves and the experimental points in figs .  [",
    "fig : plotsb ] , [ fig : plotrp ] and [ fig : plotstf ] shows a good quantitative agreement .",
    "indeed , as highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotstf ] , even when the position of the obstruction causes a significant decrease of the transmittance , the state fidelity remains always above @xmath68 .",
    "this demonstrates that , even in a high - loss regime , the initial information content encoded in the unperturbed state is preserved in the given oam subspace even if a significant spread of the initial oam spectrum takes place ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "any discrepancies may be explained by an imperfect mode generation and , more appreciably , by a higher sensitivity to small fluctuations of the fidelity parameter when @xmath50 approaches zero .",
    "this result shows that the information content of oam qubits exhibits a remarkable resilience to perturbations such as those here examined .",
    "in particular , the reported high fidelities correspond to the experimental fact that after the aperture one still has @xmath69 .",
    "this result is tied to the moderate spread of the oam spectrum of the perturbed state even for low values of @xmath50 and the progressive shift of the central spectral state when the initial mode is almost completely blocked , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the present work focuses on qubits encoded in the bidimensional @xmath4 subspace .",
    "however , it is worth noting that higher - order subspaces @xmath70 , with lg basis states @xmath71 , are likely to offer higher and higher resilience , the higher the oam winding number @xmath72 ( while we may expect a lower resilience in the @xmath73 subspace ) . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] for the @xmath74 case , the increased distance @xmath75 between the two orthogonal basis states causes the spread of the detection probabilities around a perturbed basis state @xmath76 to have a decreasing overlap with @xmath77 , as @xmath72 increases .",
    "therefore , while the information preservation probability is strongly affected , the fidelity is expected to remain high even for very low transmittance .",
    "of course , these results do not apply to other subspaces of oam not involving opposite values of the oam eigenvalue , so it remains to be seen whether the same resilience can be achieved for oam qudits .",
    "our results are also in qualitative agreement with former investigations on the oam spectrum broadening occurring for lg beams passing through variable angular optical apertures @xcite .",
    "after the classical regime experiments , we moved to a quantum regime .",
    "we are specifically interested in evaluating the resilience of the entanglement involving the oam degree of freedom of a photon , under the effect of an optical aperture .",
    "in particular , we have considered the case of a planar aperture ( function @xmath30 ) inserted in the path of a photon belonging to photon pair that is initially prepared in a hybrid entangled state of oam and polarization .",
    "the choice of using hybrid entanglement is mainly practical , as we start from a polarization - entangled pair of photons and then the quantum state of one of the two photons is transferred into oam by using a polarization - oam transferrer , as recently reported in @xcite .",
    "polarization - entangled photon pairs were created by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ; the spatial profile of the twin photons was filtered through single - mode fibers , and the polarization state of one of them was coherently transferred to the corresponding oam state .",
    "the aperture is then used to perturb the photon carrying the oam entangled information and , finally , the two - photon quantum state is analyzed and the fidelity with the initially - prepared state is computed .",
    "the experimental arrangement , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybentsetup ] , is analogous to that adopted in the high - quality generation of hybrid polarization - oam entangled photon pairs in @xcite , and it extends to the case of entangled photon pairs the setup used in the previous section .",
    "a @xmath78-thick @xmath15-barium borate crystal ( bbo ) cut for type - ii phase matching was pumped by the second harmonic of a ti : sa mode - locked laser beam . via spontaneous parametric fluorescence ,",
    "the bbo generated polarization - entangled photon pairs on modes @xmath79 and @xmath80 with wavelength @xmath81 and pulse bandwidth @xmath82 , as determined by two interference filters ( if ) .",
    "the spatial and temporal walk - off was compensated by inserting a @xmath83 wave plate and a @xmath84-thick bbo crystal on each output mode @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the source thus generated photon pairs in the polarization - encoded singlet entangled state , i.e. @xmath85 .    .",
    "( a ) generation of polarization - entangled photons on modes @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( b ) encoding of the state of one photon in the oam subspace @xmath4 through the @xmath65 transferrer .",
    "( c ) oam analysis .",
    "( d ) polarization analysis . ]    the photon in mode @xmath79 was sent through a standard polarization analysis setup and then coupled to a single - mode fiber connected to the single - photon counter modules @xmath86 .",
    "the photon in mode @xmath80 was coupled to a single - mode fiber , in order to collapse its transverse spatial mode into a pure @xmath33 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "after the fiber output , two wave plates compensated the polarization rotation introduced by the fiber ( cp ) . to transform the polarization - entangled pairs into a hybrid entangled state",
    ", photon @xmath49 was sent through the quantum transferrer @xmath87 , which converted the polarization quantum states into the corresponding oam states .",
    "after the transferrer operation the polarization entangled state is transformed into the hybrid entangled state @xmath88 .",
    "after the aperture @xmath51 , the inverse @xmath66 transferrer and a polarization analysis set was used to analyze the oam photon state .",
    "ultimately , the photon was coupled to a single - mode fiber and then detected by @xmath89 , connected to the coincidence box ( cb ) , which recorded the coincidence counts @xmath90 .",
    "+    the experimental results for the probability @xmath55 and the fidelity @xmath51 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotsbent ] .",
    "we observed that the state fidelity achieves somewhat lower values than what predicted ( and than what is obtained for the classical experiment case ) , particularly when the aperture blocks more than half of the beam .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the fidelity reduction can not be entirely ascribed to the aperture , as it remains constant even when the aperture is moved completely off the beam .",
    "the maximum fidelity of the two photon state is presumably decreased by imperfections in the source , preparation and measurement stages , to which is typically more sensitive than the single photon state . to account for this effect , we plotted the expected theoretical curves rescaled by the maximum value of measured fidelity .",
    "this rescaled curve exhibits a reasonable agreement with the experimental data ( dashed line in fig.[fig : plotsbent]b ) .",
    "in this paper we tested the robustness of oam - encoded qubits , which provide a useful and versatile quantum communication resource . in the classical case",
    ", we first demonstrated that the information encoded in a bidimensional subspace of oam can be retrieved probabilistically in the same subspace even if the state is highly perturbed in such a way as to block a significant fraction of the transverse extension of the mode .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical model .",
    "we then proceeded to demonstrate also in the single - photon regime , by using polarization - oam entangled photon pairs , the high resilience of single - photon bidimensional oam states .",
    "we verified that hybrid entanglement correlations persist even in high - loss conditions ."
