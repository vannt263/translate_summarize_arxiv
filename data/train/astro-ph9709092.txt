    "while magnetic fields seem to play a fundamental role in the production and initial collimation of astrophysical jets ( e.g. knigl & ruden 1993 , shu _ et al",
    ". _ 1995 ) , they have been neglected in most of the analytical and numerical modeling of the structure of protostellar jets since the inferred estimates of their magnitude ( @xmath3 g ) suggest that they may be not dynamically important along the flow ( e.g. , morse _ et al .",
    "however , after amplification by compression behind the shocks at the jet head , they may become relevant as they are carried backwards with the shocked gas to fill the cocoon that envelopes the jet .",
    "moreover , as the magnetized beam propagates through the surrounding medium ( which is possibly also magnetized ) , it may be stretched or bent and the associated compression of the field lines may lead to significant changes in the beam dynamics and the jet head structure .    a considerable amount of theoretical and numerical work on magnetized , adiabatic , light jets has been done to study the structure and evolution of extragalactic jets ( e.g. see birkinshaw 1997 for a review ) .",
    "most of that work has focused on the study of the @xmath4 properties of the beam against the development of the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability at the contact discontinuity between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "such studies indicate that adiabatic , supermagnetosonic jets are generally unstable to the k - h pinch and helical modes which can successfully explain the formation of structures such as knots , wiggles and filaments in those jets ( e.g. , hardee _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) . lately",
    ", these mhd studies have been extended to @xmath5 , @xmath6 jets ( todo _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , hardee & clarke 1995 , hardee , clarke & rosen 1997 ) , but the general effects of @xmath7-fields on the global evolution and morphology of @xmath8 @xmath9 jets have not yet been explored in numerical studies .    in the limit of zero magnetic field , numerical simulations of _ radiatively cooling _ , heavy jets ( i.e. , denser than their surroundings ) @xmath10 a picture believed to be consistent with protostellar jets @xmath10 have shown that thermal energy losses by the jet system have important effects on its dynamics ( e.g. , blondin , fryxell & knigl 1990 ; hereafter bfk ) .",
    "this early work was extended to three - dimensional simulations in a series of papers [ stone & norman 1993a , 1993b , gouveia dal pino & benz 1993 ( gb93 ) , 1994 , chernin _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , gouveia dal pino , birkinshaw & benz 1996 , gouveia dal pino & birkinshaw 1996 ( gb96 ) ] .",
    "all these studies have revealed that the cooling jet develops a dense , cold shell of shocked material at the head which is violently fragmented into clumps by the rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability .",
    "moreover , bfk and gb93 have found that the development of k - h modes along the beam are inhibited by the presence of cooling .",
    "recently , hardee & stone ( 1997 ) and stone , xu & hardee ( 1997 ) ( see also massaglia _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) have examined the dynamics of k - h unstable cooling jets . in the case of a supermagnetosonic jet with longitudinal magnetic field",
    ", the linear analysis of hardee & stone indicates that as long as it does not dominate the pressure , the magnetic field does not significantly impact the qualitative differences in k - h stability properties between adiabatic and cooling jets .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to extend these prior studies by examining the nonlinear effects of magnetic fields ( close to equipartition with the gas ) in the structure of radiatively cooling , heavy jets and by testing their importance on the dynamics of protostellar jets .",
    "a preliminary step in this direction was made in a previous work ( gouveia dal pino & cerqueira 1996 ) .",
    "here we mainly concentrate on the effects of the magnetic field in the jet head structure . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will explore the details of the magnetic field effects over the whole structure of the jet , covering an extensive range of parameters ( cerqueira & gouveia dal pino 1998 , hereafter cg98 ) . in  2 , the numerical method used is briefly described and in  3 , the results of the simulations are shown . the conclusions and the possible implications of our results to protostellar jets are addressed in  4 .",
    "to simulate the jets in the presence of magnetic fields , we have employed the smooth particle magnetohydrodynamics ( spmhd ) technique ( see , for instance , stellingwerf & peterkin 1990 ; meglicki 1995 , for an overview of the method ) .",
    "we solve the mhd equations in the ideal approximation using a modified version of the three - dimensional sph code previously employed by gb93 and gb96 in the investigation of the evolution of purely hydrodynamical ( hd ) jets .",
    "( a more detailed discussion with validation tests of the spmhd will be presented in cg98 . )",
    "our computational domain is a 3d rectangular box filled with particles which are initially distributed in a cubic lattice array and which represent the ambient gas .",
    "the jet of radius @xmath11 is continuously injected into the bottom of the box and propagates through the ambient medium up to a distance of @xmath12 . in the transverse directions ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) the box has dimensions @xmath15 .",
    "we use outflow conditions for the box boundaries ( e.g. , gb96 ) .",
    "the initial resolution , as defined by the initial smoothing length of the particle is @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the ambient gas and the jet , respectively .",
    "the adiabatic index of the ambient medium and the jet was assumed to be @xmath18 , and an ideal equation of state is used .",
    "the radiative cooling , due to collisional excitation and recombination , is implicitly calculated using a time - independent cooling function for a gas of cosmic abundances cooling from @xmath19 to @xmath20 k ( the cooling is set to zero for @xmath21 k ; see gb93 ) .",
    "we assume two different initial configurations for the magnetic field . in one case , we consider an initially constant longitudinal magnetic field permeating both the jet and the ambient medium @xmath22 .",
    "this kind of configuration is suggested by observations that some protostellar jets appear to be aligned with the main direction of the local interstellar magnetic field ( e.g. , appenzeller 1989 ) .",
    "the second geometry adopted here is a force - free helical magnetic field which also extends to the ambient medium and whose functional dependence is given by equations 19 to 21 of todo _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) . in these equations ,",
    "the maximum strength of the magnetic field in the system corresponds to the magnitude of the longitudinal component of the field at the jet axis .",
    "the azimuthal component attains a maximum value ( @xmath23 ) at @xmath24 ( see cg98 ) .",
    "the pitch angle at @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters of the simulations were chosen to resemble the conditions found in protostellar jets . in order to compare with previous purely hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , gb96 ) ,",
    "we adopt a number density ratio between the jet and the ambient medium @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , an ambient mach number @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the jet velocity and @xmath32 is the ambient sound speed ) , @xmath33 km s@xmath34 , and @xmath35 cm . in the mhd simulations",
    ", we assume an initial @xmath36 ( the thermal to the magnetic pressure ratio at the jet axis ) , which corresponds to a maximum initial value @xmath37 g .",
    "the corresponding initial alfvn and magnetosonic jet mach numbers are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "( see cg98 for a wider range of parameters . )",
    "figure 1 ( plate 1 ) depicts the density in a midplane section of the head of three supermagnetosonic , radiatively cooling jets after they have propagated over a distance @xmath40 , at @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 years ) .",
    "the top jet is purely hydrodynamical ( hd ) ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) ; the middle jet has an initial constant longitudinal magnetic field configuration ( with @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ; and the bottom jet has an initial helical magnetic field ( with axial @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . in the hd case ,",
    "the ratio of the radiative cooling length in the post - shock gas behind the bow shock to the jet radius is @xmath47 and the correspondig ratio behind the jet shock is @xmath48 ( gb93 ) .",
    "these cooling length parameters imply that within the head of the jet , the ambient shocked gas is almost adiabatic whereas the shocked jet material is subject to rapid radiative cooling .",
    "similar initial conditions are obtained for the mhd cases .",
    "the time evolution of the corresponding velocity distribution is presented in figure 2 .    in the pure hd jet ( figs . 1 and 2 , top )",
    ", we can identify the same basic features seen in previous work ( e.g , gb93 ) . at the head of the jet , the working surface develops a cold dense shell ( with maximum density @xmath49 , at @xmath41 ) due to the cooling of the shock - heated jet material .",
    "this shell is responsible for most of the emission of the jet .",
    "it becomes r - t unstable ( gb93 ) and breaks into clumps which spill into the cocoon .",
    "the density of the shell also undergoes oscillations with time which are caused by global thermal instabilities of the radiative shocks ( see e.g. , gaetz , edgar & chevalier 1988 , gb93 ) .",
    "the cold clumps seen in the hd jet also develop in the shell of the mhd jet with longitudinal field ( figs . 1 and 2 , middle ) ,",
    "but in this case they detach from the beam as they are expelled backwards to the cocoon .",
    "the fragmentation of the shell is also accompanied by density oscillations ( due to the global thermal instability ) but with a maximum amplitude which is smaller than that of the hd jet ( @xmath50 , at @xmath51 ) .    in the mhd jet with helical magnetic field ( figs . 1 and 2 , bottom )",
    ", a cold shell also develops initially at the jet head , but the toroidal component which is initially less intense than the longitudinal component ( by a factor @xmath52 ) is amplified by compression in the shocks at the head ( by a factor @xmath53 ) .",
    "this amplification reduces the density enhancement and increases the cooling length behind the jet shock . as a consequence",
    ", the shell tends to be stabilized against the r - t instability and the fragmentation and formation of clumps is thus inhibited ( see also cg98 ) .",
    "the dense shell with clumps seen in the pure hd jet ( fig .",
    "1 , top ) is replaced in this helical field case by an elongated , narrow plug of low - density material ( @xmath54 ) which is pushed by magnetic forces towards the jet axis and is mixed with the beam material .",
    "figure 2 also shows the development of some pinching along both mhd jets . in the pure hd case",
    ", constriction occurs only close to the jet head where the beam is overconfined by the gas pressure of the cocoon . in the mhd jet with helical field ,",
    "the toroidal component ( @xmath55 ) is amplified by compression in the shocks at the head , and advected back with the shocked jet material to the cocoon .",
    "the associated magnetic pressure ( @xmath56 ) causes an increase in the total pressure of the cocoon , relative to the pure hd case .",
    "the increase in the total pressure and the inherent discreteness of the sph code in the beam excites ( the fastest growing ) small - wavelength pinch modes of the k - h mhd instability ( see , e.g. , birkinshaw 1997 , cohn 1983 ) .",
    "these modes overconfine the beam and drive the approximately equally spaced internal shocks seen in the mhd jet with helical field at the positions x @xmath57 , 3@xmath11 and 7@xmath11 ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom ) .",
    "the fact that both , the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure in the cocoon have approximately the same magnitude , and the toroidal magnetic field exceeds the longitudinal component , suggests that the unstable modes are driven by both magnetic field effects and the velocity discontinuity at the interface between the jet and the cocoon .",
    "it is interesting to note that the numerical study of todo _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) employed a similar helical field geometry . in that case",
    "however , the collision of the jet with the ambient cloud led to an mhd kink instability that is not seen in our simulations .    along the mhd jet with longitudinal field ( fig .",
    "2 , middle ) , the increase in the total confining pressure of the cocoon also drives the development of k - h mhd instabilities which produce the beam pinching and internal shocks seen in the figure .",
    "consistent with the linear theory for k - h modes in the supermagnetosonic regime , they begin to appear at a distance @xmath58 . as expected",
    ", this destabilization length is smaller than that for the pure hd jet .",
    "also , we found a close correlation between the pinching zones and the appearance of more intense reversed magnetic fields at the contact discontinuity between the jet and the cocoon .",
    "the originally uniform longitudinal fields are reoriented in the non - parallel shocks at the head and swept - back into the cocoon . as a consequence , a predominantly toroidal current density distribution develops around the jet radius ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "such configuration creates a @xmath60 force ( @xmath61 ) that constricts the beam ( this is analyzed in detail in cg98 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of fully three - dimensional simulations of supermagnetosonic , overdense , radiatively cooling jets with two different initial magnetic field configurations ( with magnitude in close equipartition with the gas ) .",
    "our results indicate that magnetic fields can have significant effects on the morphology and dynamics of radiatively cooling jets , particularly at the @xmath62 structure .    as in previous adiabatic mhd calculations ( todo _",
    "_ 1993 ; frank _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , the helical field in the cooling jet is amplified and reoriented by the shocks at the head .",
    "this reduces the post - shock compressibility and thus increases the post - shock cooling length relative to the pure hydrodynamical ( hd ) jet .",
    "this stabilizes the shell at the head against the r - t instability . as a result",
    ", the clumps that develop by fragmentation of the dense shell at the head of the hd jet do not appear in the helical magnetic jet .",
    "instead , the clumpy , dense shell is replaced by an elongated plug of low - density material which is pushed to the jet axis by the development of @xmath63 forces .",
    "this structure resembles the nose cone seen in previous adiabatic simulations of strongly magnetized jets with toroidal fields ( e.g. , clarke , norman & burns 1986 , kssl , mler & hillebrandt 1990 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a cooling jet embedded in a longitudinal magnetic field retains the clumps seen at the head of the hd jet .",
    "the fact that the fragmented , clumpy shell resembles the knotty structure often observed in herbig - haro objects behind the bow shocks of protostellar jets ( e.g. , hh1 , hh2 , hh19 , hh12 , hh95 , hh45 , hh47d @xmath10 herbig & jones 1981 ; brugel _ et al . _",
    "1985 ; reipurth 1989 ; heathcote _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) suggests that a strong helical magnetic field geometry is unlikely in these jets .",
    "if the jet is permeated by strong magnetic fields , these are probably predominantly longitudinal , at least in the outer regions of the jet far from the driving source .    over the simulated time and length scales , in both initial magnetic field configurations but not in the hd run ,",
    "approximately equally spaced internal shock are produced by k - h mhd reflection modes .",
    "these shocks propagate forward with velocities similar to that of the head of the jet ( @xmath64 km s@xmath65 ) .",
    "the mean distance between the internal shocks @xmath66 is in agreement with the observed jet knots .",
    "however , the weakness of these shocks ( @xmath67 ) makes it doubtful that they could produce by themselves knots as bright as those observed in protostellar jets .",
    "finally we note that the beam pinching seen in the mhd cooling jets discussed here is also found in adiabatic jets with similar initial conditions ( see cg98 ) .",
    "their strength is , however , larger in the adiabatic case .",
    "this result is consistent with previous numerical analyses comparing pure hd jets with and without cooling ( e.g. , bfk , gb93 ) , which have indicated that the presence of radiative cooling tends to reduce the strength and the number of internal shocks in the jets .",
    "this result is also compatible with the predictions of the linear stability theory ( hardee & stone 1997 ) when applied in the context of the cooling function employed in the present work .",
