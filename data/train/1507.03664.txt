    "we call this application _ dasasap _ for _ develop all syllogisms as soon as possible_. to introduce this application we show the logical foundations for the game with a system we call @xmath0 ( section  [ sec:1 ] ) , and its interface developed with livecode ( section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",

    "a _ categorical proposition _ is a proposition with a defined quantity ( universal or particular ) , a subject @xmath1 , a quality ( affirmative or negative ) , and a predicate @xmath2 .",
    "the adequate combinations of these elements produce four categorical propositions , each one with a name :    * proposition @xmath3 states @xmath4 .",

    "* proposition @xmath7 states @xmath8 .",
    "* proposition @xmath9 states @xmath10 .",
    "a _ categorical syllogism _ is a sequence of three categorical propositions ordered in such a way that the two first propositions are called _ premises _ ( major and minor ) and the last one is called _",
    "conclusion_. within the premises there is a term @xmath11 , known as _ middle term _ , that works as a _ link _ that gathers the remaining terms , namely , @xmath1 and @xmath2 :    1 .",
    "major premise : _ all _ @xmath11 _ is _ @xmath2 .",
    "minor premise : _ all _ @xmath1 _ is _ @xmath11 .",
    "conclusion : _ all _ @xmath1 _ is _ @xmath2 .    the previous example can be represented as a string of characters using the terms and proposition names stated previously in an infix notation : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 indicates that the premises are to the left and the conclusion to the right . according to the position of the middle term @xmath11 we can build four _ figures _ of the syllogism that encode all the valid and only the valid syllogisms .",
    "these have been named using mnemonics  @xcite ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",

    "when finished , a jigsaw puzzle mechanically produces a complete picture by the adequate interlocking of all the pieces ; when the pieces can not be interlocked , the jigsaw puzzle can not be completed , and thus the picture can not be mechanically produced .",
    "these types puzzles date back as far as archimedes  @xcite , so the historical paths of logic and jigsaw puzzles have a long tradition , although the typical pictorial jigsaw puzzles we are familiar with have their roots in europe when john spilsbury s first dissected maps in the 1760s primarily for educational purposes  @xcite .",

    "@xmath28 is a system that uses adequate combinations of polygons as jigsaw puzzles in order to decide the ( in)validity of categorical syllogisms .",
    "its vocabulary is defined by two elementary diagrams ( i.e. , pieces ) , socket and knobs ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .    , width=188 ]    syntax is given by a single rule : if a diagram belongs to the vocabulary of @xmath28 , the diagrams depicted in figure  [ fig:2 ] , and only those , are well formed diagrams .",

    "width=264 ]    we can arrange this system in a square of opposition ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) . it should be clear that the only rules preserved in this square are the rules for _ contradiction _ between @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath7 ) ; the rules for _ contraries _ , _ subalterns _ , and _ subcontraries _ do not work .",
    "thus , this system s square behaves as a modern square of opposition rather than a traditional square . also , _ conversion _ ,",
    "_ contraposition _ , and _ obversion _ are valid transformations in this square .    , width=264 ]      using a single term , in this case the middle term",

    "* proposition @xmath9 states @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] shows the four categorical propositions using the middle term @xmath11 .",
    "we can observe that from these four cases only @xmath3 encodes a logical truth , that is , a true statement for any structure , provided it is a weak version of the @xmath29 as in @xmath34 .",
    ", width=264 ]    using the @xmath29 we suggest a decision algorithm for syllogistic in @xmath28 with complexity of @xmath35 ( algorithm 1 ) .",
    "hence , this algorithm not only is time efficient but sound and complete :    ( soundness ) if @xmath36 then @xmath37 is valid .    _ proof .",
    "_ let us denote the application of algorithm  [ alg:1 ] to a given syllogism @xmath37 from figure @xmath38 and row @xmath39 in table  [ tab:1 ] by @xmath40 ( thus , for instance , the application of algorithm  [ alg:1 ] to a _",
    "syllogism is @xmath41 ) .",
    "we prove soundness by cases .",
    "since there are four figures , we need to cover each valid syllogism from each figure . here",
    "we only show the first case that covers the syllogisms of figure 1 ( _ barbara _ , _ celarent _ , _ darii _ , and _ ferio _ ) in section  [ subsec : example ] .",
    "the remaining syllogisms can be proven similarly .",
    "thus , we have that for every @xmath37 , when @xmath36 , @xmath37 is valid .",
    "@xmath42    ( completeness ) if @xmath37 is valid then @xmath36 .    _",
    "proof_. we prove this by contradiction .",
    "suppose that for all @xmath43 , the syllogism @xmath37 is valid but for some valid syllogism @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "now , we know @xmath46 is valid and if we apply @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 , as we can see in section  [ subsec : example ] .",
    "so , since all valid syllogisms @xmath49 can be reduced to the valid syllogisms of figure 1 by the rules of equivalence ( conversion , contraposition , and obversion ) , it follows that @xmath50 , and thus , for all valid syllogisms @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which contradicts our assumption .",
    "@xmath42      as an example of how @xmath28 works we prove the four valid syllogisms of figure 1 ( figure  [ fig:10 ] ) , but it should be clear that the other syllogisms can be proven similarly .",
    "we just stack up two well formed diagrams that represent the premises . when the middle terms _ interlock _ each other forming the @xmath29 in a jigsaw puzzle style ( which is a step denoted by the arrows ) , the inference is valid , thus allowing the terms @xmath1 and @xmath2 interlock in the third diagram , i.e. , the conclusion , which is below the turnstile.,width=529 ]",
    "our application , _ dasasap _ , is motivated by the impact of syllogistic in our education and culture , is inspired upon @xmath28 , and is implemented with livecode , which is an event - oriented programming language that allows the development of cross - platform applications .    at this moment _ dasasap _ comes with two modes : _ arcade _ and _ learning_. in the arcade mode the user tries to develop valid syllogisms as quick as possible thinking in a jigsaw puzzle style . the objective of this mode is to fasten the recognition of valid syllogisms .",
    "the learning mode is a tutorial mode that helps users understand how to develop syllogisms in a jigsaw puzzle style assuming the ideas of @xmath28 and thus showing the basic concepts of logic ( propositions , truth values , form - content distinction , and so on ) .    in figure  [ fig:11 ]",
    "we can see the game s home screen running in ubuntu 12.04 .",
    "we also depict fragments of the learning and arcade modes ( figures  [ fig:12 ] and  [ fig:13 ] ) .",
    "the learning mode includes four options . in the option _",
    "what s logic about ? _ the application explains the basic concepts of logic in order to provide an operative definition of logic : proposition , argument , form - content distinction , and truth - valid distinction are some of the concepts included .",
    "the option _",
    "so you think you are logical ? _ leads to a mini - game that produces a ranking : the user is given random syllogisms and the user must decide whether they are valid or invalid",
    ". the options _ what s a syllogism _ and _ what s dasasap ? _ are self - explanatory .",
    "the arcade mode keeps track of the ranking of the user and allows the construction of syllogisms by measuring time efficiency and accuracy in the development of syllogisms .",
    "we have introduced an application we call _ dasasap _ for _ develop all syllogisms as soon as possible_. we showed its logical foundations with a system we call @xmath0 , which is a sound and complete system that uses adequate combinations of polygons as jigsaw puzzles in order to decide the ( in)validity of categorical syllogisms .",
    "we have implemented the mechanics of this system with livecode in order to develop a cross - platform application to aid the teaching - learning process of basic logic .    since this application is a small fragment of a larger project we are currently developing , at the moment we are refining the implementation and the overall design .",
    "we are also adding a reward system and different match - three puzzle styles ."
