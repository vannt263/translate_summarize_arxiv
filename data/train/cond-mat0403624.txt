    "since mandelbrot s work @xcite on analysing cotton prices that lvy distribution has been widely used , but , frequently with lvy scaling coefficients greater than @xmath1 , and so , out of lvy regime@xcite . an alternative way of describing these tailed distributions can be power laws ( usually called @xmath2_-gaussians _ or _ tsallis distributions _ ) obtained by optimising the entropic form proposed by constantino tsallis@xcite .",
    "those distributions , beyond presenting the advantage of finite second ( and higher ) order momenta ( for a certain range of values of its characterizing index @xmath3 ) are also the solution of various kinds of non - linear fokker - planck equations@xcite often used as continuous time approaches to financial systems . in this manuscript",
    "one shows that a generalisation of @xmath4non - extensive formalism permits a good adjustment to the tick - by - tick log - return distributions for lisbon stock market .",
    "it is known that the consecrated boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropic form , @xmath5 , is able to provide a perfect description of an all range of phenomena with microscopic spatial / temporal short - range interactions , but is not capable to give proper answers when systems present microscopic spatial / temporal long - range interactions @xcite or multifractal structure @xcite . in order to deal with this glitch , tsallis presented the entropic form@xcite , @xmath6 ^{q}\\ dx}{1-q}\\ ] ] @xmath7 , which contains bgs as a particular case when @xmath8 . for this entropic form",

    "yields the following power - law ( @xmath3-gaussian ) , @xmath11 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\equiv e_{q}^{-\\beta _ { q}x^{2 } } , \\label{q - gauss1}\\ ] ] which in the limit @xmath12 recovers the gaussian distribution .",
    "the @xmath3-gaussian , @xmath13 , can be rewritten , in a quite interesting way , as the solution for the non - linear differential equation , @xmath14 ^{q}.   \\label{q - gauss2}\\ ] ] from this equation one can obtain the ( simmetrical)@xmath15-exponential distribution changing @xmath16 by @xmath17 and the exponential distribution considering also @xmath12 . for reasons that will be presented in the next section",

    "here one neglets the time spacing between transactions which are , in mean , of order of @xmath36 seconds and its possible influence in the magnitude of variations .",
    "the description of log - return s distribution has been successfully done with @xmath37-gaussians when the lag between elements at least of the order of minutes ( or greater ) , but fails when one deals with time series where lag is smaller for which data seems to be better approached by exponential functions @xcite . however , as can be seen in fig .",

    ", @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 one obtained the full line which presents a very good agreement , and clearly the best compared to other distributions , for data from lisbon stock market for six decades in ordinate and two and a half decades in abcissa .",
    "for the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 used , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "unfortunately , the finiteness of data does not allow the observation of the second crossover which occurs at a value of @xmath46 where it is not possible to have a good statistics .",
    "in conclusion one can state that like in biological and cosmological phenomena , the superposition of power - laws which maximise tsallis entropy can be an excellent approach in order to describe anomalous distributions in finance , fact that could be a sign of a peculiar dynamics ( probably due to market characteristics like volume , number of traders ) different than the ones presented until now . despite the fact that aggregations were not analised here , existing works , where two regions can also be observed in the probability density function of returns @xcite , points that this distribution will relax firstly to the @xmath3-gaussian @xcite and finally to the gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "although the study of tick - by - tick time series is usually negleted in favour of , e.g.,1 minute lag time series , its analysis could be important in the reach of a better understanding of the nature of these ( beautiful financial ) systems , because all phenomena observed at major time scales have their origin in this time scale dynamics .",
