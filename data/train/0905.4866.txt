    "we are currently investigating the results of the application of the gated accretion model to 18483  and 18  ( bozzo et al .",
    ", 2009 , in preparation ) .    in this paper , besides x - ray flux changes , we also measured a spin - period variation in 18483 .  by using our best - determined spin - period , @xmath34=21.033@xmath00.004  s , and that found previously by @xcite",
    ", we obtained a spin - period derivative in 18483  of @xmath73=-(1.3@xmath00.3)@xmath110@xmath2  s  s@xmath3 .",

    "* ) and those induced by accretion torques in wind - fed binaries ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in the present case we believe that the spin - period derivative most likely results from light travel time effects in the binary .",
    "in fact , in a binary system with an orbital period of @xmath418.5  days , these effects can contribute to an apparent spin - period derivative of the order of @xmath4@xmath74/@xmath75=8.6@xmath110@xmath76  s  s@xmath3 , i.e. much larger than the spin - period derivative we reported above ( here @xmath74 is the orbital velocity and @xmath75 is the light velocity ; we used the mass and radius of the supergiant companion measured by * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , since a detailed orbital solution for this source is not yet available , we do not know if accretion torques acting onto the ns in 18483  might also have contributed to the observed spin - period derivative .",
    "note that , in principle , this can be used to study the interaction between the ns and the inflowing matter from the supergiant companion ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an orbital monitoring of 18483  is required in order to understand the origin of the measured spin - period derivative .",
