    "while a considerable amount of work on the strictly - correlated - electrons ( sce ) formalism @xcite within the framework of ground state kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) has been carried out , @xcite the study of its performances in the time domain is just starting .",
    "@xcite the aim of this work is to begin a systematic investigation of the sce functional in the context of time dependent problems , in order to understand its fundamental aspects and its potential in tackling challenging problems for the standard approximations employed in time - dependent ( td ) dft .",
    "we will hence focus on those physical situations described by an explicitly time - dependent hamiltonian , and whose dynamics is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . due to the existence of a time - dependent density - potential mapping @xcite for interacting and non - interacting systems ,",
    "a time - dependent kohn - sham approach can be rigorously set up and employed to study the dynamics of quantum systems at a manageable computational cost .",
    "choosing the initial non - interacting wave function to be a single slater determinant of some spin orbitals @xmath0 , one can reduce the tdse to a set of single - orbital equations , the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equations , of the form ( in hartree atomic units used throughout ) : [ eq : tdks ] i _ t _",
    "j(,t ) & = & - ^2 + v_ext(,t ) + v_h([n ] , , t ) + & + & v_xc([_0,_0,n];,t ) _",
    "j(,t ) , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 initial states of the true interacting and of the non - interacting ks system .",
    "the time - dependent density is thus computed in the familiar way ( for simplicity in this introduction we consider closed - shell systems ) as : n(,t ) = 2^n/2_j=1 |_j(,t)|^2 .",

    "trading the many - body tdse for the one - particle tdks equations has a price to pay , that is the time - dependent exchange - correlation potential @xmath6;{\\mathbf{r}},t)$ ] of tddft is an even more complex object than the @xmath7 for ground state dft , as it is a functional of the density at all times @xmath8 and , additionally , of the initial state of both the interacting and non - interacting systems .",
    "however , whenever the initial state for the evolution problem described by the tdks equations is chosen to be the ground state of the system , then the functional dependence of the xc potential is on the electronic density alone : since this scenario occurs naturally in many problems of interest , it does nt pose actual limitations and thus it is often adopted in practical applications . similarly to ground state dft , in order to make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdks ] ) one needs approximations for the exchange correlation potential @xmath9 . a first drastic approximation , which is used in the large majority of cases in tddft , is the so - called _",
    "adiabatic approximation _",
    ", obtained by inserting in a ground - state approximate @xmath10;{\\mathbf{r}},t ) $ ] the _ instantaneous _ density , ignoring dependence on the density at earlier times .",
    "this approximation has a very specific range of validity  infinitely slowly varying perturbations , such that the system is always in its ground state  but it is very often employed outside it , with results that can vary from very satisfactory to poor , depending on the nature of the problem addressed . in certain cases , it is still difficult to disentangle the errors due to the adiabatic approximation and the errors due to the approximation for the ground - state exchange correlation potential , but considerable progress has been made in recent years , by analysing , when possible , the `` adiabatically exact '' potential .",
    "@xcite in other cases , it is instead well established that neglecting all `` memory effects '' in @xmath9 ( or equivalently frequency dependence in the so called xc kernel , @xmath11 of linear response tddft ) , does not allow tddft to describe excitations with a predominantly double character .",
    "@xcite in the tddft framework , adiabaticity is thus equivalent to locality in time .",
    "the most common approximations used to build the adiabatic @xmath9 ( and @xmath11 in the linear response case ) in tddft , are local and semi - local functionals , which thus add to locality in time locality in space as well . in these cases ,",
    "the time - dependent kernel @xmath12 is approximated as @xmath13;{\\mathbf{r}}t,{\\mathbf{r}}'t')=\\frac{\\delta^2 e_{xc}^{\\rm              appr}[n]}{\\delta n({\\mathbf{r}},t ) \\delta n({\\mathbf{r}}',t ' ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is evaluated at the instantaneous density and it is often a local or semi - local approximate functional , which makes the kernel different from zero only on ( or very close to ) the diagonal @xmath15 .",
    "we have already hinted at the shortcomings of the locality in time in this introduction , but also the locality in space has serious limitations , a notorious example being the description of excitations with a long - range charge transfer ( ct ) character @xcite . in the case of closed - shell fragments ,",
    "the introduction of a considerable portion of hartree - fock exchange ( often introduced at long - range only through range - separation ) is able to fix the ct problem in linear response tddft .",
    "@xcite however , this solution does not work for the very challenging case of homolytic bond breaking excitations , the prototypical example being the lowest excited singlet state @xmath16 of the h@xmath17 molecule .",
    "@xcite in this case , the kernel should diverge in order to compensate the fact that this excitation in the ks system goes to zero as the bond is broken .",
    "@xcite in this context , we will show that , at least in a model one - dimensional case , the adiabatic sce ( asce ) kernel shows a very promising non - local diverging behavior .",
    "+ in order to construct approximations both for potentials and kernels in tddft , one can be guided by trying to satisfy exact properties and constraints of many - body theories . in a series of works",
    "@xcite dobson and vignale devised a number of constraints ( named theorems afterwards ) that the time - dependent @xmath7 should comply to , in order to avoid unphysical results or contradictions in the theory . from their analysis , it appeared for the first time that the interplay between non locality in space and non locality in time is a delicate issue in tddft and this fact needs to be kept in mind when looking for approximations , making this task much more challenging than in ground state dft .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether a highly non - local functional such as sce can satisfy these exact conditions when employed in the adiabatic approximation .",

    "we will complete the section with a discussion on some general features of the kernel , pinpointing at those which arise from its highly non - local nature and which could be promising for the description of bond - breaking excitations .",
    "finally we will give our conclusions and perspectives for future work .",
    "the sce formalism can be put in the dft context starting with the generalization of the hohenberg - kohn functional @xmath18 $ ] to scaled interactions : @xmath19 = \\min_{\\psi \\rightarrow n } \\bra \\psi | \\hat{t } + \\lambda \\hat{v}_{ee } | \\psi \\ket \\label{eq : ghk - func}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the familiar kinetic and two - body interaction operators , while @xmath22 is a parameter varying continuously from 0 to @xmath23 , yielding different scenarios : @xmath24=t_s[n]$ ] corresponds to the non interacting or kohn - sham system , @xmath25 $ ] corresponds to the real physical system , while @xmath26 $ ] defines the strong - coupling limit , @xcite captured by the strictly - correlated - electron functional @xmath27 \\equiv \\min_{\\psi \\rightarrow n } \\bra \\psi |\\hat{v}_{ee } | \\psi \\ket .",

    "the functional is then specified in terms of the so - called co - motion functions @xmath32 ; { \\mathbf{r}})$ ] that determine the set in which @xmath33 , @xmath34=\\frac{1}{2}\\int n({\\mathbf{r}})\\sum_{i=2}^n\\frac{1}{|{\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{f}}_i([n ] ; { \\mathbf{r}})|}d{\\mathbf{r}}.\\ ] ] the functional derivative of @xmath35 $ ] defines the sce potential : @xmath36;{\\mathbf{r } } ) = \\frac{\\delta v^{\\rm sce}_{ee}[n]}{\\delta n({\\mathbf{r } } ) } ,    \\label{eq : sce_def}\\ ] ] which can be computed via a rigorous and physically transparent shortcut @xcite as the repulsion felt by an electron in @xmath37 due to the other @xmath38 electrons at positions @xmath39 ; { \\mathbf{r}})$ ] , @xmath40 ; { \\mathbf{r } } ) = -\\sum^{n}_{i=2 } \\frac{{\\mathbf{r } } - { \\mathbf{f}}_i([n ] ; { \\mathbf{r}})}{|{\\mathbf{r } } - { \\mathbf{f}}_i([n ] ; { \\mathbf{r}})|^3}. \\label{eq:3dsce - pot}\\ ] ] all the @xmath41({\\mathbf{r}})$ ] , whose physical meaning is to give the positions of all the others @xmath38 electrons once the position of a reference electron has been fixed in @xmath37 , satisfy the following non - linear differential equation : @xmath42;{\\mathbf{r } } ) ) d { \\mathbf{f}}_i([n];{\\mathbf{r } } ) = n({\\mathbf{r } } ) d{\\mathbf{r } } \\quad \\quad i = 2, .. ,n-1 \\label{eq : diffeqf}\\ ] ] which shows their non - local dependence on n@xmath43 .",
    "furthermore the co - motion function obey ( cyclic ) group properties @xcite which ensure that the electrons are indistinguishable .    in the recent years , it has been realized that the problem defined by the minimization is equivalent to an optimal transport problem with coulomb cost .",
    "@xcite since then , the optimal transport community has been able to prove several rigorous results . in particular , the sce state has been proven to be the true minimizer for any number of particles @xmath44 in one dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite and in any dimension for @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite for more general cases , it has been shown that the minimizer might not be always of the sce form @xcite . even in those cases , however , sce - like solutions seem to be able to go very close to the true minimum , @xcite and in several cases it is still possible to prove eq .   .",

    "; { \\mathbf{r}})$ ] , to stress that this potential is the strong - coupling approximation to the standard hxc potential of ks dft .",
    "@xcite now that the basics of the sce formalism at the ground state level have been reviewed , we can move to the time - dependent domain .",
    "since the success of tddft relies heavily on the availability and the quality of the approximations for @xmath48;{\\mathbf{r}},t)$ ] and for the linear response exchange - correlation kernel @xmath49,{\\mathbf{r}},{\\mathbf{r}}',t , t')$ ] , there have been intense research efforts towards better approximations . as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "a way to guide such approximations is to resort to the compliance to exact constraints from many - body theories , similarly to what has been done extensively already in ground state dft .",
    "a first exact condition is given by scaling relations , @xcite a second one by a sum rule for the time - dependent exchange - correlation energy @xcite and just like in the static case , the time - dependent xc potential should be self - interaction free . +",
    "in addition to the constraints enumerated above , a very important condition on approximate xc potentials is that they should be _ galilean invariant _ , as a consequence of the fact that the tdse itself exhibits this symmetry .",
    "this condition was first investigated by vignale , @xcite as a generalization of an earlier work by dobson @xcite on the so called harmonic potential theorem ( hpt ) , which states that upon the application of a time - dependent field to a many - body system confined by an harmonic potential , its time - dependent density is rigidly shifted . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the hpt is automatically satisfied whenever the time - dependent xc potential obeys a precise constraint , that is upon a rigid shift of the system s time - dependent density , the time - dependent xc potential is rigidly translated by the same quantity .",
    "we will refer to this property as generalized translational invariance ( gti ) , since it holds also for coordinates frames which are accelerated with respect to the original one .",
    "+ thus in general the gti can be formalized as follows : given an arbitrary ( be or not time - dependent ) shift of the density @xmath50 : @xmath51 the xc potential associated with this density has to transform accordingly to : @xmath52;{\\mathbf{r}},t ) = v_{xc}([n];{\\mathbf{r } } -{\\mathbf{r}}(t),t )    \\label{eq : gtigen}\\ ] ]      we will now show explicitly show that the asce complies to this requirement . + we begin by observing that in the sce limit , upon the shift of the density , all the relative distances between the electrons have still to be the same , thus the co - motion functions transform as : @xmath53 ; { \\mathbf{r } } ) = { \\mathbf{f}}_i([n ] ; { \\mathbf{r } } - { \\mathbf{r}}(t ) ) + { \\mathbf{r}}(t ) .",

    "+ a second important constraint is that the xc potential can not exert a net external force on the system , which is nothing else than the compliance to newton s third law of motion . in dft",
    "this property goes under the name of zero force theorem ( zft ) and in @xcite it was shown how it is automatically satisfied for translationally invariant xc potentials .",
    "one may think that this is a trivial requirement to be satisfied , but in practice it is nt .",
    "for example in @xcite it was demonstrated numerically that computing the dipole moment of small na@xmath56 and na@xmath57 clusters , via the exact exchange krieger - li - iafrate approximation to @xmath7 , yielded an increased amplitude in the dipole oscillations , most likely due to spurious internal forces appearing as a consequence of the violation of the zft .",
    "the zft not only has implications for the approximations to the time - dependent xc potential , but also on another key quantity of tddft , namely the exchange correlation kernel . in @xcite vignale",
    "showed how a frequency dependent ( thus non local in time ) @xmath58 _ can not _ be local in space , in order to satisfy the zft .",
    "a notable example of a kernel which violates the zft and the hpt too , is the gross - kohn @xmath58 @xcite which indeed is frequency dependent , but local in space , as it is based on the homogeneous electron gas .",
