    "the finite - size scaling theory , introduced by fisher , finds extensive applications in the analysis of experimental , monte carlo , and transfer - matrix data , as well as in recent theoretical developments related to conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "it becomes of practical interest due to the recent progresses in fine processing technologies , which has enabled the fabrication of nanoscale materials with novel shapes @xcite .",
    "exact solutions have been playing a key role in determining the form of finite - size scaling .",
    "ferdinand and fisher @xcite pioneered on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model on a finite size square lattice , which extended onsager s exact solution @xcite and stimulated the ideas of finite - size scaling .",
    "since then , exact results of the model on finite size lattices with various boundaries have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge has been obtained for the torus case @xcite , for the helical boundary condition @xcite , for the brascamp - kunz boundary condition @xcite and for an infinitely long cylinder @xcite .",
    "the exact solution on the triangular lattice has also been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "however for the 2d ising model the exact solution with free boundaries , i.e. free edges and sharp corners , is still missed . as we know , the bethe ansatz is a powerful technique to solve the 2d ising model , but this technique would not allow to place the system on a rectangle with free boundary conditions on top and bottom , since the expression of the boundary state in terms of the bethe eigenvectors is unknown , which is a famous unsolved problem in statistical mechanics .",
    "although there are monte carlo and transfer matrix studies on this problem @xcite , the accuracy or the system sizes of the results are not enough for extracting the finite size corrections . meanwhile , for 2d critical systems , a huge amount of knowledge has been obtained by the application of the powerful techniques of integrability and conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "cardy and peschel predicted that the next subdominant contribution to the free energy on a square comes from the corners @xcite , which is universal , and related to the central charge @xmath5 in the continuum limit .",
    "kleban and vassileva @xcite extended the result to a rectangle .",
    "these results are consistent with the conjectured exact analytic formula for the ising model on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "several years ago an efficient bond propagation ( bp ) algorithm was developed for computing the partition function of the ising model with free edges and corners in two dimensions @xcite . making use of this algorithm",
    ", we recently determined numerically the exact partition function of the ising model on the square lattice with rectangle shape and free boundaries @xcite .",
    "we not only confirmed the cft predictions , but also found logarithmic corrections due to corners in the internal energy and specific heat .",
    "in present paper we apply the bp algorithm to study the ising model on finite triangular lattices with free boundaries in five different shapes , focusing on how the shape affects the finite - size scaling .",
    "the five shapes are triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ shape ] . based on accurate data on a sequence of finite systems with linear size up to @xmath1",
    ", we extract the bulk , surface and corner parts of the free energy , internal energy and specific heat accurately .",
    "we verify the conformal field theory prediction of the corner free energy and find logarithmic corrections in higher order terms in the critical free energy for the rhombus , trapezoid , and hexagon shaped systems , which are absent for the triangle and rectangle shaped systems . the logarithmic edge corrections due to edges parallel or perpendicular to the bond direction in the internal energy",
    "are found to be identical , while the logarithmic edge corrections due to the corresponding edges in the specific heat are different .",
    "the corner internal energy and corner specific heat for angles @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are obtained , as well as higher order corrections . comparing with the previous found corner internal energy and corner specific heat on a rectangle of the square lattice @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the corner internal energy and corner specific heat for the rectangle shape are not universal .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] , we briefly describe the bp algorithm used here .",
    "we present in sec .",

    "( e ) the rectangle - shaped lattice with @xmath8 .",
    "three bond directions and the perpendicular direction are shown ( see text).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the partition function of the ising model on the 2d triangular lattice is @xmath9 where the nearest neighbor couplings are dimensionless and @xmath10 is the inverse temperature .",
    "this partition function for finite triangular lattice with five different shapes and open boundaries is calculated with the bp algorithm @xcite at the exact critical point @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ shape ] shows the five shapes : triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle . the linear size @xmath12 of a finite lattice is defined as the length of edges in the triangle , rhombus and hexagon cases , of which the length of edges are equal . for the trapezoid shape , @xmath12 is the shortest edge , of which the lengths of the three short edges are required to be equal . for the rectangle , @xmath12",
    "is defined as the length of the bottom edge , and the number of layers is required to be @xmath12 , which means the actual geometrical vertical length is @xmath13 . according to the finite - size scaling @xcite",
    ", the system size should be the actual geometrical length , not the number of layers .",
    "therefore the aspect ratio of the rectangle , we consider here , is @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 .",
    "the bp algorithm for the ising model on the triangular lattice has been described in detail in @xcite . for the triangle - shaped and rhombus - shaped lattice",
    ", this algorithm can be applied directly . however , for the trapezoid - shaped , hexagon - shaped and rectangle - shaped lattice , the inverse of the bp series reduction should be introduced , which corresponds to generating a new spin between two spins such that @xmath16 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bp](a ) .",
    "it is convenient to use variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then we get the solution @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in each step of the bp algorithm",
    "the transformation is exact .",
    "the numerical accuracy is only limited by the machine s precision , which is the round - off error @xmath21 in the quadruple precision . the bp algorithm needs about @xmath22 steps to calculate the free energy of a @xmath23 lattice ( much faster than other numerical method ) .",
    "therefore the total error is approximately @xmath24 .",
    "this estimation has been verified in the following way : we compared the results obtained using double precision , in which there are 16 effective decimal digits , and those using quadruple precision .",
    "because the latter results are much more accurate than the formal , we can estimate the error in double precision results by taking the quadruple results as the exact results .",
    "we thus found that the error is about @xmath25 . in our calculation , the largest size reached is @xmath1 , the round - off error is less than @xmath0 .",
    "the free energy density , internal energy per spin and specific heat density are calculated at the critical point according to @xmath26 respectively , where @xmath27 is the number of spins on the lattice , which is @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 for the triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle shaped system , respectively .",
    "one can alternatively define the free energy density according to the actual geometrical area , which is different from the present definition by a trivial constant .    with the bp algorithm",
    ", we obtain the free energy density @xmath33 directly .",
    "the internal energy and specific heat are calculated by using a differentiation method @xmath34 in our calculation , @xmath35 is used .",
    "the analysis of error in the calculations of @xmath36 and @xmath5 has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the final estimation of the accuracy of the free energy , internal energy and specific heat is @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the calculations were carried out for @xmath38 systems , with linear size @xmath12 varying from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , for the triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle shaped triangular lattice , respectively .",
    "by fitting the finite size data , we find that the exact expansion of the critical free energy can be written in the following form , with @xmath41 from 3 to 12 for the triangle and rectangle , @xmath41 from 3 to 9 for the other shapes : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the perimeter , which equals to @xmath44 for the triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle , respectively .",
    "this expansion is different from that for the triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , in which there s no surface , corner terms , logarithmic corrections , and only even @xmath41 presents .",
    "the fitting method is the standard levenberg - marquardt method for nonlinear fit .",
    "the standard deviation ( sd ) is defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46 the numerical data , @xmath47 the value given by the fitting formula , @xmath48 the number of data used and @xmath49 the number of fitting parameters .",
    "for all cases , @xmath50 reaches @xmath51 .",
    "the accuracy is seen from the fitted bulk free energy density @xmath52 : the worst fit among the five cases is for the rhombus , which yields @xmath53 , and the best one is for the triangle yielding @xmath54 .",
    "these results coincide with the exact value @xmath55 @xcite in more than 24 decimal numbers .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fitsh ]    following the convention for the critical free energy , we write the coefficient of @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "we denote the corner correction by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the angle of the corner . again , under the assumption that the total correction is the sum of the corners , we have @xmath60 from tab . [ fitien ] , we obtain the corner contribution of the three angles , @xmath61    in the previous study on the square lattice @xcite , we obtained the corner term @xmath62 for the rectangle with various aspect ratios .",
    "it is different from the present result @xmath63 for the rectangle - shaped triangular lattice , which indicates that the corner term of the specific heat depends on the microscopic structure of the lattice , thus is not universal .",
    "we have also tried other forms of fitting formula to fit the critical specific heat data .",
    "for example , we added the terms @xmath64 in the fitting formula and found that their coefficients are extremely small .",
    "[ conclusion ] using the bp algorithm , we have studied the 2d critical ising model on a triangular lattice with free boundaries . for five shapes , triangle , rhombus , trapezoid , hexagon and rectangle , the critical free energy , internal energy and specific heat have been calculated .",
    "we have proved the conformal field theory prediction of the corner free energy and have shown that the corner free energy , which is proportional to the central charge @xmath5 , is indeed universal .",
    "for the edges parallel or perpendicular to the bond direction , the logarithmic edge corrections in the internal energy have been found to be almost identical , while these corrections in the free energy and in the specific heat have been found to be different . comparing with the previous result on the square lattice in the rectangle shape , we have found that the corner internal energy @xmath65 and the corner specific heat @xmath57 for the rectangle shape are not universal , i.e. , the coefficient in front of @xmath66 in the expansion of the internal energy and the specific heat are different for the square lattice and the triangular lattice .",
    "we have also found that there exist logarithmic corrections in higher orders , say , there are terms @xmath67 in the critical free energy for the rhombus , trapezoid , and hexagon shapes .",
    "however these terms are absent for the triangle and rectangle shapes .",
    "this should be an interesting subject to be further investigated ."
