    "graph cut , partitioning the vertices of a graph into two or more disjoint subsets , is a fundamental problem in graph theory @xcite .",

    "there exist several kinds of balanced graph cut @xcite .",
    "the cheeger cut @xcite , which has recently been shown to provide excellent classification results  @xcite , is one of them and its definition is as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 denote a undirected and unweighted graph with vertex set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath3 .",
    "each edge @xmath4 is a pair of vertices @xmath5 . for any vertex @xmath6 , the degree of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 ,",
    "is defined to be the number of edges passing through @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two nonempty subsets of @xmath10 and use @xmath11 to denote the set of edges between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the edge boundary of @xmath8 is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the complement of @xmath8 in @xmath10 ) and the volume of @xmath8 is defined to be @xmath14 the number @xmath15 is called the _ cheeger constant _ , and a partition @xmath16 of @xmath10 is called a _ cheeger cut _ of @xmath17 if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the cardinality of the set @xmath20 .",
    "however , solving analytically the cheeger cut problem is combinatorially np - hard @xcite .",
    "approximate solutions are required .",
    "the most well - known approach to approximate the cheeger cut solutions is the spectral clustering method , which relaxes the original discrete combination optimization problem into a continuous function optimization problem through the graph laplacian @xcite .",
    "the standard graph laplacian ( i.e.  the @xmath21-laplacian ) is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a diagonal matrix and @xmath24 the adjacency matrix of @xmath17 . according to the linear spectral graph thoery ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 and the second eigenvalue @xmath27 can be used to bound the cheeger constant as follows @xmath28 which is nothing but the cheeger inequality @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding second eigenvector is also used to approximate the cheeger cut , i.e.  the @xmath21-spectral clustering or the @xmath29 relaxation .",
    "it should be noted that this second eigenvector is not the cheeger cut , but only an approximation @xcite .    in order to achieve a better cut than the @xmath29 relaxation ,",
    "a spectral clustering based on the graph @xmath30-laplacian defined by @xmath31 with small @xmath32 was proposed , in view of the fact that the cut by threshold the second eigenvector of the graph @xmath30-laplacian tends to the cheeger cut as @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath34 denotes vertex @xmath35 is adjacent to vertex @xmath6 , @xmath36 means the summation is with respect to all vertices adjacent to vertex @xmath6 , and @xmath37 is the standard sign function which equals to @xmath0 if @xmath38 , @xmath39 if @xmath40 , and @xmath41 if @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting @xmath43 relaxation @xmath44 is differentiable but nonconvex , so that standard newton - like methods can be applied , but only local minimizers are obtained . in actual calculations ,",
    "multiple runs with random initializations are taken to approximate the global minimizer .",
    "all above mentioned @xmath30-spectral clustering for any @xmath45 $ ] are _ indirect _ methods .    since the second ( the first non - zero ) eigenvalue of @xmath0-laplacian ( see definition  [ defn:1_lap ] ) for connected graphs equals to the cheeger constant , and the corresponding eigenvectors provide exact solutions of the cheeger cut problem  @xcite .",
    "we study the numerical solution of the second eigenvector of the graph @xmath0-laplacian .    however , the @xmath46 nonlinear eigenvalue problem ( the corresponding object function is obtained by setting @xmath47 in eq .  ) is not only nonconvex but also nondifferentiable .",
    "three types of algorithms have been proposed to minimize the @xmath0-spectral clustering problem .",
    "they are : the split - bregman like ratio minimization algorithm  @xcite , the inverse power ( ip ) method  @xcite , and the steepest descent ( sd ) algorithm  @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", all these methods fail to give global minimizers .    motivated by a recently developed nonlinear spectral graph theory of @xmath0-laplacian  @xcite by the first author of this paper , we propose a cell descend ( cd ) algorithm framework .",
    "the main idea is based on the fact that the feasible set consists of a collection of cells , and the objective function on each cell is convex . at each step , one obtains the minimum on the initial cell , and finding out a suitable direction transfer to a new cell by descending the value of the objective function .",
    "this cd algorithm framework combines the advantages of both the original discrete combination optimization and its equivalent continuous optimization .",
    "preliminary numerical results on several typical graphs demonstrate that the proposed cd algorithm framework could provide better cut than the ip and sd methods . in order to provide a solid theoretical foundation for algorithms",
    ", we also present a unified framework for designing algorithms for the @xmath0-laplacian cheeger cut problem , in which both ip and sd algorithms can be easily recovered but from a totally different angle .",

    "the first one is shown in line 3 and the second one is shown in line 9 , both of which are convex and then can be solved by any standard solver for convex optimization , e.g.  the alternating direction method  @xcite and the mosek solver .",
    "the same situation applies to the cd2 method .",
    "applying the idea of relaxing the objective function in @xmath102 , a cd algorithm framework in solving the @xmath0-laplacian cheeger cut problem is proposed and two specified cd methods ( i.e.  cd1 and cd2 ) are presented .",
    "the cd1 method adopts the inner problem eq .   to search the next cell , while the cd2 method uses",
    "actually , we have shown that both ip and sd methods can be readily recovered from such relaxation .    in this section ,",
    "we conduct a compare study of the cd1 , cd2 , ip and sd methods in terms of performance on several typical graphs , e.g.  the petersen graph , the path graph ( e.g.  @xmath482 ) , the roach graph and the complete graph ( e.g.  @xmath483 ) .",
    "the petersen graph has 10 vertices ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : typical : petersen ] ) and the exact cheeger value is @xmath484 while the second eigenvalue of the standard graph laplacian is @xmath485 .",
    "that is , the cheeger value takes the lower bound of inequality ( [ eq : mu_2&lambda_2 ] ) on the petersen graph , implying that the petersen graph should be one of the most typical graphs on which the @xmath21-spectral clusering fails to determine the cheeger cut .",
    "another interesting graph is the so - called roach graph  @xcite , which has @xmath486 vertices ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : typical : roach ] for @xmath487 , i.e.  a roach graph @xmath488 ) and is a typical graph that the @xmath21-spectral clusering fails , too .",
    "four roach graphs of different size ( i.e.  @xmath489 with @xmath490 ) are tested .",
    "that is , a comparison between the @xmath0- and @xmath21-laplacian cheeger cuts in the roach graphs makes no sense .",
    "moreover , this work focuses on the @xmath0-laplacian cheeger cut , while its comparison with the @xmath30-spectral clusering ( @xmath491 ) methods can be found in @xcite .    to solve all envolved convex inner problems as well as to make a fair comparison",

    ".performance of the ip , sd , cd1 and cd2 methods on typical graphs .",
    "avergae number of iterations and the percent for the numerical cheeger value @xmath493 reaching the exact cheeger value @xmath494 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     during all the experiments , we start from the same @xmath495 initial random cuts and record the numbers of iterations as well as the resulting numerical cheeger values .",
    "let @xmath493 denote the numerical cheeger value .",
    "table  [ tab : htilde = h ] shows the percent for @xmath493 equalling the exact cheeger value @xmath494 ( @xmath494 equals to @xmath496 for the petersen graph , @xmath482 , @xmath483 , @xmath497 , @xmath498 , @xmath499 and @xmath488 , respectively ) and the average number of iterations required in those four methods .",
    "from there it is easily seen that : ( a ) the sd method needs more iterations than the other and its average number of iterations increases quickly on the roach graph as the graph size increases ; ( b ) both cd1 and cd2 methods require almost the same average numbers of iterations on all seven graphs , which are also less than those for the ip method ; ( c ) the cd1 method has the highest percent to reach the exact cheeger value .",
    "table  [ tab : compare ] further presents the pairwise comparison of the numerical cheeger values obtained by the ip , sd , cd1 and cd2 methods .",
    "overall , the cd1 method provides the best cut among those four methods .",
    "for example , on the petersen graph , the percent for @xmath500 is far less than that for @xmath501 , which means , within the 1000 numerical cheeger values from the same @xmath495 initial random cuts , the cd1 method produces much more smaller numerical cheeger values than the ip method . in such sense",
    ", we have the order on the petersen graph : cd1 @xmath502 sd @xmath503 cd2 @xmath502 ip . in summary",
    ", the cd1 method has the better performance in terms of both the number of iterations and the quality of cut , but the cd2 method does not show clear advantage in the quality of cut .",
    "that is , while using the the cd framework to design a specified algorithm , as we expected , the strategy for searching next cell plays a key role . the numerical results here show that the strategy using the inner problem in eq .",
    "is better than that using the inner problem  .",
    "in this paper , we present a systematic review of the theory of the @xmath0-laplacian cheeger cut , where the spectrum of the @xmath0-laplacian @xmath77 , the property of the feasible set @xmath102 and the conncetion between the cheeger value @xmath106 and the second eigenvalue @xmath107 of @xmath77 are studied in details . taking advantage of the cell structure of @xmath102",
    ", we propose a cell descend ( cd ) algorithm framework for achieving the cheeger cut .",
    "combined with the relaxation to guarantee the descrease of the objective value in @xmath102 , we obtain two specified cd methods .",
    "moreover , we also show that the inverse power ( ip ) method and the steepest descent ( sd ) method can also be generally recovered from such relaxation . a compare study of all these methods are conducted on several typical graphs .",
    "we find that , the cd1 method , which adopts the inner problem in eq .   to search the next cell , performs better than both ip and sd methods .",
    "we must admit that all the numerical results presented in this work are preliminary since the size of the graphs is small , but precisely because of small size of those typical graphs the exact cuts can be obtained conveniently for comparison",
