    "following the original discovery by josephson in 1962 @xcite , the so - called external josephson effect was extensively studied in superconducting @xcite , superfluid helium @xcite and atomic bosonic weak links @xcite both theoretically and experimentally . it has also been argued for a system of superfluid @xmath0he-@xmath1 @xcite that josephson - like effects may occur for two condensates which are not spatially separated but occupy different quantum states .",
    "later , experimental observation of internal josephson effect in a two - state bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath2rb atoms was also reported @xcite .",
    "theoretical research on the josephson particle transfer between the ground and an excited state of an atomic bose condensate is provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , a new ground for the josephson physics investigation appeared : microcavities @xcite .",
    "great theoretical and experimental activity was aimed to study josephson phenomena in exciton - polariton becs coupled via a double - well potential @xcite .",
    "bosons participating in the phenomena are composite half - light half - matter quasiparticles interacting via their excitonic component @xcite , while the photon component allows them to condense at high critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that different dynamical regimes which result from the interplay between the tunneling coupling strength of the two condensates and the interparticle interactions depend on the specific system under consideration @xcite , the oscillations discussed in context of polaritons always imply that the two polaritonic becs are spatially separated by a tunnel barrier . however , since polaritons itself are composite and result from strong coupling between the photon and quantum well exciton modes inside a planar optical cavity , they may be considered as a mixture of the two bose - condensed components performing mutual transformations .",
    "the internal dynamics of an exciton - polariton gas was kept behind the scenes until the year of 2014 , when several experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works on polariton rabi oscillations clearly demonstrated that there is a rich variety of dynamical behaviors in the system of exciton - polaritons still to be explored .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to the study of various regimes of internal oscillations in the system of coupled linear ( non - interacting ) and non - linear ( interacting ) becs occupying the same two - dimensional space , depending on the energy detuning between the two states .",
    "the theoretical problem in consideration is general , although we keep the polariton background in mind for the sake of realistic simulation parameters , which we extract from the recent microcavity experiments .",
    "whereas for a pure quantum two - level system with no interactions the dynamics is described by single - particle harmonic rabi oscillations , we show that in a more sophisticated system such as bec with interactions and non - zero energy detuning , various scenarios of _ collective _ non - linear oscillations become possible , including harmonic and anharmonic modifications of rabi oscillations , the analog of internal a.c .",
    "josephson effect , and full suppression of oscillations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce all notations and the theoretical model , and analyze the time - dependent coupled equations describing temporal dynamics of the system . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we solve the evolution equations , both analytically and numerically , and discuss various dynamical regimes of the system which can be realized , depending on the parameters .",

    "@xmath7 is the constant of repulsive interaction in the 1st ( interacting ) component .",
    "particle transfer between the subsystems is described by the coupling term @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rabi splitting energy .",

    "therefore we omit all the spatial derivatives in eqs .",
    "( [ gpe_1 ] ) and ( [ gpe_2 ] ) .",
    "further in this paper , we rescale lengths and energies in terms of harmonic - oscillator units @xmath13 and @xmath9 , respectively , time as @xmath14 and the wavefunctions as @xmath15 . after the madelung transformation @xmath16",

    "the dimensionless effective detuning @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and the dimensionless blueshift value @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are the parameters which determine different regimes of the system behavior .",
    "it is worth noting that for a closed conservative system that we consider the equations ( [ rho ] ) , ( [ s ] ) have hamiltonian form for canonically conjugate variables : @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath54 is quasiperiodic with a modulated `` period '' @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath57 , eq . ( [ s_harmonic ] ) reduces to @xmath58 , and hence the relative phase oscillates with the same frequency @xmath41 as does the population imbalance @xmath59 . if @xmath60 is comparable to @xmath61 or @xmath62 , @xmath54 becomes strongly unharmonic while @xmath59 oscillates with large amplitude @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig01 ] shows population imbalance and relative phase against time for the case of small - amplitude oscillations ( @xmath64 ) and for large - amplitude oscillations ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "speaking of polaritons , these two different initial states may be prepared with the help of different pumping schemes .",
    "upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] assumes that an almost equal population of coherent excitons and photons is taken as initial condition , which can be achieved with non - resonantly excited polariton condensate .",
    "resonant excitation would imply that polaritons are created through their photonic component , then the initial conditions will correspond to the situation shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that the lower polariton state corresponds to the relative phase between the photon and exciton subsystems equal to @xmath33 ( due to the positive sign chosen in eqs .",
    "( [ gpe_1 ] ) , ( [ gpe_2 ] ) in front of the coupling term @xmath66 ) , therefore here and below we will always imply the initial phase difference @xmath67 unless stated otherwise .",
    "if there is no initial population imbalance @xmath68 , the system will stay in the pure rabi regime which consists of density oscillations ( with the imbalance always zero ) without oscillations of the relative phase .     and",

    ", this difference appears as a shift of the oscillation frequency @xmath82 . for large - amplitude oscillations ,",
    "when one considers large values of @xmath19 comparable to @xmath32 , oscillations frequency becomes dependent on the initial values @xmath70 and @xmath83 .",
    "the regimes of oscillations at different values of @xmath80 are not shown here as they are completely analogous to those appearing in the bosonic josephson junction thoroughly discussed in ref .",

    "let us now focus at the main goal of the present research : the case of non - zero effective detuning , in which the system behavior is influenced by the additional term @xmath91 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the resulting dynamics should be governed by a competition of the terms @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "physically , the detuning between the modes is assumed to be less than or comparable to the rabi splitting energy @xmath9 , which in unscaled units used in this paper means that the absolute value of @xmath35 ranges from zero to a number of the order one .",
    "therefore , since the maximum ratio @xmath94 equals 1 , for almost all values of @xmath35 the term containing @xmath93 wins this competition .    whereas for the case @xmath34 and small @xmath80 the time - average @xmath95 was always zero , for @xmath96",
    "the oscillations of @xmath59 always average to a non - zero number dependent on @xmath80 , @xmath93 and the initial conditions .",
    "for vanishing @xmath80 , @xmath97 thus , for a given @xmath70 , the shift of @xmath95 is determined by @xmath93 .",

    "the interplay between the rabi and the `` a.c .",
