    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on board the x - ray satellite _ bsax _ was triggered by a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) on 29 march 1997 , ut 3 h 44 m 30 s and localised by the wide field camera ( wfc ) on _ bsax _ at @xmath2 ( uncertainty @xmath3 radius ) .",
    "grb 980329 was very intense and reached a peak intensity of 6 crab in the 2 - 26 kev range , being the second brightest burst localised so far with the wfcs ( frontera et al .",
    "the event was also detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ , which provided a position consistent with the one given by the wfc ( briggs et al .",
    "a follow - up observation was initiated within 7 hr with the _ bsax _ narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) .",
    "the observation revealed a previously unknown x - ray source , 1sax j0702.6 + 3850 , that faded by a factor of @xmath4 3 over 14 hr of observation ( in ' t zand et al .",
    "radio observations performed with the vla at 8.4 ghz resulted in the detection of a variable radio counterpart that peaked @xmath4 3 days after the burst ( taylor et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "this detection allowed observers to re - examine images taken on the first night after the gamma event .",
    "thus , observations at the position of the radio counterpart revealed a fading source in the i- ( klose 1998 ) , r- ( palazzi et al . 1998 , pedersen et al . 1998 ) , and k - bands ( larkin et al .",
    "1998a , b ; metzger 1998 ) as well as in submillimetre wavelengths ( smith & tilanus 1998a , b ) .    the data provided by the interplanetary network ( ipn ) allowed to derive an annulus that intersected the wfc error and reduced its area ( hurley et al .",
    "the new error box included the 1sax j0702.6 + 3850 x - ray source , the variable radio source and the optical transient ( ot ) .",
    "deep optical observations revealed a faint galaxy ( r @xmath5 mag ) coincident to the optical fading source ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) , that was pointed out as the grb 980329 host galaxy . here",
    "we present the result of the optical observations performed at several observatories .",
    "optical images in the r and b bands were acquired with three telescopes , namely the 1.5-m oan at the german - spanish observatorio de calar alto , the 1.0-m jkt at observatorio del roque de los muchachos and the 1.0-m ogs telescope at observatorio de izaa .",
    "( -375,101 ) ( -124,101 )    the 1.5-m oan telescope is located at calar alto and its ccd provides a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath6 .",
    "the 1-m jkt telescope , placed at la palma , gives a fov of @xmath7 .",
    "the european space agency ogs is a 1-m telescope at the observatorio del teide .",
    "its camera provides a @xmath8 fov .",
    "all three telescopes are equipped with a 1024 @xmath9 1024 pixel ccd .",
    "table 1 displays the log of the performed observations for grb 980329 .",
    "the images were debiased and flat - fielded in the standard way using the iraf reduction package .",
    "magnitudes for the ot and for other objects in the field were obtained using the sextractor software based on the corrected isophotal magnitude , which is very useful for star - like objects ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) . in order to compare the magnitude of the object with others r - band measurements available on 29 - 30 march , we made use of the local standard considered by palazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who on 29.99 march reported r = 23.6 @xmath0 0.2 mag for the ot .",
    "this star is located at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and has a magnitude r = 18.29 @xmath0 0.05 mag ( palazzi 1998 ) .",
    "it has to be pointed out that this calibration is systematically shifted  @xmath12 mag with respect to the one reported by rhoads et al .",

    "however , the jkt image taken on 29.89 march shows the presence of a faint object located at the position of the radio and optical grb counterparts ( taylor et al .",
    "1998b , klose 1998 ) .",
    "astrometry of the object was carried out by means of 15 stars in the image whose coordinates were taken from the usno - a2.0 catalogue . thus we obtain @xmath15 , @xmath16 for the counterpart , which is @xmath1 @xmath17 away from the position of the radio counterpart .",
    "the magnitude of the ot at this time was r = 23.7 @xmath0 0.5 mag .",
    "our detection on 29.89 march is the second earliest optical detection of grb 980329 , corresponding the earliest one to the i - band detection by klose ( 1998 ) . as it can be seen on fig .",
    "2 , this value is consistent with the measurements reported by other authors , namely r = 23.6 @xmath0 0.2 mag on 29.99 march , r = 25.2 @xmath0 0.3 mag on 1.125 april ( palazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) and r = 25.7 @xmath0 0.3 mag on 2.0 april ( djorgovski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of the confidence level of our 2@xmath18 detection by means of sextractor is done following two methods .",
    "first , we considered the peak to peak signal - to - noise ratio , resulting that the peak intensity of the object is 4.5@xmath18 above the background level . on the other hand ,",
    "aperture photometry measurements for the object and for several random points in the surrounding area were obtained by means of a fortran code developed by us .",
    "then , we calculated the confidence level in the same way as we did for the first case but using the integrated fluxes instead of the peak intensities . when aperture photometry of the object was carried out considering radii ranging from 3 to 6 pixels ,",
    "the confidence level of the detection lies in the 3.4 - 2.0@xmath18 range . as expected",
    ", enhancing the aperture makes the background to come in , impoverishing the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the peak signal - to - noise ratio only takes into account the maximum value of the photodensity profile , so usually it will be larger than the one obtained with the aperture photometry .",
    "the ot magnitude and the 3@xmath18 limiting magnitudes displayed in table 1 have been calculated considering the most unfavourable case of a 6 pixels radius , where the detection of the object is at a 2.0@xmath18 level .",
    "this fact explains why the magnitude of the object is below the quoted 3@xmath18 limiting magnitude of r = 22.8 mag .",
    "if a gaussian fit is made to the object photodensity profile , we obtain a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 3 pixels ( or 1@xmath19 ) , which is the typical value of the seeing derived for other objects in the field . on the basis of the confidence levels obtained , we consider the detection as _ real . _      by fitting a power law to the observed flux @xmath20 we obtain an index @xmath21 .",
    "the value of the reduced - chi - squared @xmath22 for the fit is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that the low value of the reduced - chi - squared is due to the fact that the errors in the data points have been overestimated .",
    "this value is in agreement with the one given by palazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who obtained @xmath25 .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the expected light curve for a r = 25.7 mag host galaxy ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) does not match well the observed flux .",
    "this suggests that the total optical flux was still dominated by the contribution of the ot when its magnitude was r = 25.7 mag on 2.0 april .",
    "in fact , if we extrapolate a single power law decay from the first three points to the one of 2.0 april , a value of r = 25.8 mag is obtained for the ot .",
    "this value is consistent , within the uncertainties , with the value measured at that date ( r = 25.7 @xmath0 0.3 mag ) .",
    "if we consider now the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed flux @xmath26 , we can estimate the magnitude of the host galaxy .",
    "the values of @xmath27 exhibits a broad minimum around r = 27.4 mag and so we conclude that the magnitude of the grb 980329 host galaxy should lie in the range given by 26.8 mag @xmath1 r @xmath1 29 mag .",
    "grb 970111 and grb 980329 are two of the most intense grbs detected by _ bsax _",
    ", showing prominent emission above 40 kev .",
    "in fact , their fluence in the 50 - 300  kev range is more than four times larger than the other grbs detected ( with the exception of grb 990123 ) . on the other hand , they displayed the hardest spectra , showing a hardness ratio ( hr ) between 0.5@xmath00.2 and 1.0@xmath00.2 ( in ' t zand et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore ,",
    "at first sight one could speculate that both grbs were originated under similar physical conditions and nearer than the other grbs of the _ bsax _ sample .",
    "if this was the case , the optical decay curves should be somehow similar .",
    "this fact could give us a clue for explaining the non detectability of grb 970111 ot @xmath419 hr after the gamma - ray event ( castro  tirado et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming a similar decay trend and apparent magnitude for grb 970111 than those of grb 980329 , the magnitude of the grb 970111 ot 19 hr after the high energy event would be r @xmath4 23.5 mag , just below the detection limit of our images taken on 20 jan , 1997 ( gorosabel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it could be possible that both grbs were originated from a host galaxy at @xmath28 , a nearby source in comparison to the other _ bsax _ grbs for which redshifts has been measured .",
    "in fact , palazzi et al . (",
    "1998 ) have suggested that grb 980329 could be arised from a strongly obscured starburst galaxy at @xmath29 .",
    "this statement could be supported if a correlation between the @xmath30-ray flux and distance of grbs is present .",
    "however , such a correlation has not been detected among the bsax grbs sample .",
    "furthermore , it is in contradiction to the photometric redshift estimation of fruchter ( 1999 ) , who proposes that grb 980329 host galaxy is at @xmath31 .",
    "we present the optical follow up observations performed for grb 980329 by means of the data acquired at the ogs , oan and jkt telescopes .",
    "only the image taken on 29.89 march with the jkt telescope reveals an object within @xmath32 from the ot and radio positions .",
    "the magnitude of the ot on 29.89 march was r = 23.7 @xmath0 0.5 mag , which is consistent with r = 23.5 @xmath0 0.2 mag on 29.99 march , reported by palazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    based on extrapolations of the light curve",
    "we claim that the r - band magnitude of the grb 980329 host galaxy should lie in the range 26.8 mag @xmath1 r @xmath1 29 mag , considerably fainter as claimed by djorgovski et al .",
    "this prediction should be tested with deep ground - based or _",
    "hst _ observations .",
    "grb 980329 shows similar characteristics to grb 970111 . assuming a similar decay trend and apparent magnitude , the ot associated to grb 970111 19 hr after the high - energy event would be r @xmath4 23.5 mag , just below the detection limit of our data",
    "this fact could explain the non - detection of the grb 970111 ot .",
    "we whish to thank the referee , j. greiner for his valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "we are also indebted to m. tafalla for his valuable support at the 1.5-m oan telescope .",
    "we are very grateful to eliana palazzi and nicola masseti for valuable information on the calibration stars .",
