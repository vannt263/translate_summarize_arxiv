    "the pioneering idea of the rotation of the universe should be attributed to g. gamow @xcite , who expressed the opinion that the rotation of galaxies is due to the turbulent motion of masses in the universe , and  we can ask ourselves whether it is not possible to assume that _ all matter in the visible universe is in a status of general rotation around some centre located far beyond the reach of our telescopes ? _ \" .",
    "the idea of turbulence as a source of the rotation of galaxies was afterwards developed by c.f .",
    "von weizsaeker @xcite , ozernoy and chernin @xcite , ozernoy @xcite , but presently is only of historical value .",
    "[ if the angular momenta of galaxies had orginated in such a way , their spins should be perpendicular to the main protostructure plane @xcite , which is not observed . ] the exact solution of the einstein equation for the model of a homogeneous universe with rotation and spatial expansion was proposed by goedel @xcite .",
    "the observational evidence of global rotation of the universe was presented by birch @xcite .",
    "he investigated the position angles and polarisation of classical high - luminosity double radio sources , finding that the difference between the position angle of the source elongation and of the polarisation are correlated with the source position in the sky .",
    "immediately there appeared a paper by phinney and webster @xcite concluding that  the data are unsufficient to substantiate the claim \" and the statistics are applied incorrectly .",
    "answering , birch @xcite pointed out the difference in the quantity investigated by him and that by phinney and webster , showing that their data exhibit the such effect . at the request ofbirch , phinney and",
    "webster @xcite reanalysed the data , introducting new  indirectional statistics \" and taking into account possible observational uncertainties .",
    "they concluded  that the reported effect ( _ whatever may be its origin _ ) is strongly supported by the observations \" .",
    "bietenholz and kronberg @xcite repeated the analysis for a larger sample of objects , finding no effect of the birch type .",
    "new statistical tests were later applied to the data @xcite .",
    "nodland and ralston @xcite studied the correlation between the direction and distance to a galaxy and the angle @xmath0 between the polarisation direction and the major galaxy axis .",
    "they found an effect of a systematic rotation of the plane of polarisation of electromagnetic radiation , which depends on redshifts .",
    "as usually , the result was attacked for the point of incorrectly applied statistics @xcite see the reply @xcite with a claim that the new , better data do not support the existence of the effect @xcite .",
    "the problem of the rotation of the whole universe has attracted the attention of several scientists .",
    "it was shown that the reported rotation values are too big when compared with the cmb anisotropy .",
    "silk @xcite pointed out that the dynamical effects of a general rotation of the universe are presently unimportant , contrary to the the early universe , when angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "he stressed that now the period of rotation must be greater than the hubble time , which is a simple consequence of the cmb isotropy .",
    "barrow , juszkiewicz and sonoda @xcite also addressed this question .",
    "they showed that cosmic vorticity depends strongly on the cosmological models and assumptions connected with linearisation of homogeneous , anistropic cosmological models over the isotropic friedmann universe .",
    "for the flat universe , the value is @xmath2 .",
    "another interesting problem was the discussions on the empirical relation between the angular momentum and mass of celestial bodies @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "li - xin li @xcite explained this relation for galaxies as a result of the influence of the global rotation of the universe on galaxy formation .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic models of the universe with matter may not only expand , but also rotate relative to the local gyroscope .",
    "the motion of the matter can be described by raychaudhuri equation .",
    "this is a relation between the scalar expansion @xmath4 , the rotation tensor @xmath5 and the shear tensor @xmath6",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "the perfect fluid has the stress - energy tensor : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is mass density and @xmath9 is pressure .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the acceleration vector ( vanishing in our case ) , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are rotation and sheer scalar respectively , @xmath4 is scalar expansion .      because @xmath14 falls off more rapidly than the rotation @xmath15 as the universes",
    "expand it is reasonable to consider such generalization of friedmann equation in which only the  centrifugal \" term is present i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is energy density , @xmath18 is curvature constant , @xmath19 is scalar factor and @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) .",
    "equation ( 2 ) should be completed with the principle of conservation energy momentum ( tensor ) and that of angular momentum : @xmath22 @xmath23 from that we can observe that if @xmath24 ( dust ) then @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while in general @xmath14 falls as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the momentum conservation law should be satisfed for each kind of matter , and consequently the angular velocity of the universe will evolve according to different laws in different epochs . before decoupling ( @xmath28 ) , matter and radiation interact but after decoupling dust and radiation evolve separately with their own angular velocities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "quantities @xmath15 and @xmath8 can be written as @xmath31 , @xmath32 the total mass density of matter and radiation .",
    "the conservation of the angular momentum of a galaxy relative to the gyroscopic frames in dust epochs gives @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the density of matter in the present epoch , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is galaxy radius , and @xmath0 is a parameter determined by the distribution of mass in the galaxy .    in @xcite the ( present ) value of the angular velocity of the universe is estimated .",
    "a suitable value for @xmath18 is 0.4 ( in cgs units ) .",
    "taking @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( peebles @xcite for rich clusters of galaxies , see also @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath41        for us it is important that @xmath47 grows as a function of @xmath48 after the minimal value of @xmath48 . it should be stressed that the value of @xmath43 _ does not depend _ on the value of @xmath15 , i.e. the value of the rotation of the universe .",
    "li - xin li @xcite considered the way an object of the size of our galaxy is gaining angular momentum .",
    "it is an interesting approach to the cosmogonical problem . following the considerations of li - xin li @xcite by accepting @xmath49 , @xmath50 between 1 and 3 , @xmath51 , and assuming the value of @xmath0 @xmath52 or @xmath53 as the coefficient of the inertia momenta in the equation for a celestial object ( i.e assuming disk like spherical shapes ) we obtain the value of @xmath54 .",
    "1 shows dependence of @xmath44 in that case .    from the observational point of view , only absolute values of @xmath47 in relation ( 5 ) are important . due to this fact , the minimum value of @xmath55 is easily observed . from equation",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6a ) it is seen that this value equals 0 for : @xmath56 in the considered case @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "this is sub - globular cluster mass .",
    "it seems to be accepted that such structures are not rotating .",
    "let us consider a proto - solar cloud with a diameter of about @xmath60 @xmath61 . because the formation time of the solar system is certainly shorter than that of the galaxy formation , equation ( 7 ) gives @xmath62 .",
    "such are the masses of giant satellites in the solar system . disregarding the moon ,",
    "their angular momenta are smaller than those of planets and asteroids @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass corresponding to the minimal momentum of a celestial body shows correctly those structures which in reality have the minimal value of angular momenta .",
    "numerical simulations with dark matter taken into account show that primordial picture of large scale structure formation consists of a network of filaments . during gravitational collapse ,",
    "clusters of galaxies are formed at the intersections of filaments .",
    "the question arises : how great @xmath63 ( for dust ) should be . assuming the radius of the proto - structure to be of the order of 30 mpc , which is consistent with the perseus - pisces and hydra - centaurus superclusters @xcite and @xmath64",
    "then we obtain @xmath65 . taking into account that this is the mass of dust",
    ", it corresponds to the total mass of galaxy cluster of the order of @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "these contributions are consistent with observations under the assumption that the evolution of dark matter density follows that of dust density .",
    "we point out that presently there is no evidence of rotation of cluster of galaxies .",
    "in other words , our considerations show that the predicted masses of structures having minimal angular momenta are in agreement with observations .",
    "assuming that the density , in which the proto - structure is formed is equal to the dust density of the universe , the radius of the proto - structure together with the redshift formation univocaly determines the mass @xmath59 for which the absolute value of the angular momentum of the structure is minimal .",
    "this relation is schematicaly presented in the fig.2 . in such a manner it is possible to consider a universal mechanism of structure rotation .",
