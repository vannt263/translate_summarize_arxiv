    "the study of supernovae ( sne ) which are significant sources of radio emission , known as `` radio supernovae '' ( rsne ) , provides unique information on the properties of the progenitor stellar systems and their immediate circumstellar environments . in particular , changes in the density of the presupernova stellar wind established circumstellar material ( csm ) alter the intensity of the radio emission and allow us to probe the mass - loss history of the supernova s progenitor , structures in the csm , and the nature and evolution of the sn progenitor .",
    "significant deviation of the radio emission of sne from standard models has previously been noted and interpreted as due to a complex csm density structure .",
    "sn  1979c ( weiler et al .  1986 , 1991 ) has shown a quasi - periodic variation in its radio emission which may be due to modulation of the csm density by a binary companion ( weiler et al .",
    "1992 ; schwartz & pringle 1996 ) .",
    "sn  1987a , after an initial , faint radio outburst and rapid decline until 1990 june , is now increasing in radio flux density due to the sn shock starting to impinge on the inner edges of the well known , much higher density central ring ( turtle et al .  1990 ; staveley - smith et al .",

    "sn  1980k ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) at an age of @xmath0 years has experienced a sharp drop in its radio emission far beyond that expected from models of its previous evolution .",
    "more recently , sn  1988z has also shown a sharp drop in its radio emission similar to that of sn  1980k ( lacey et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "recent observations of sn  1979c imply that the shock from sn  1979c has entered a new , higher density csm structure different from the modulated decline previously reported ( weiler et al .",
    "the radio emission has apparently stopped declining and has been constant , or perhaps increasing , for the past eight years .",
    "we have monitored sn  1979c [ ra@xmath1 ; dec@xmath2 in ngc 4321 ( m 100 ) since 1979 april 27 , and the results through december 1990 are available in weiler et al .",

    "we present new very large array ( vla ) radio measurements between 1991 july 28 and 1998 october 19 .",
    "routine monitoring observations of sn  1979c have been carried out with the vla at 20 cm ( 1.465 ghz ) and 6 cm ( 4.885 ghz ) a few times a year since 1991 . on 1996",
    "december 21 & 1998 february 10 , observations were additionally made at 3.6 cm ( 8.435 ghz ) and 2 cm ( 14.965 ghz ) .",
    "the techniques of observation , editing , calibration , and error estimation are described in previous publications on the radio emission from sne ( see , e.g. , weiler et al .",

    "the `` primary '' calibrator remains 3c  286 and is assumed to be constant in time with flux densities 14.45 , 7.42 , 5.20 , and 3.45 jy , at 20 , 6 , 3.6 , and 2 cm , respectively .",
    "the `` secondary '' calibrator , 1252 + 119 , was used as the phase ( position ) calibrator with a defined position of ra(1950)=@xmath3 , dec(1950)= + @xmath4 , and , after calibration by 3c  286 , as the actual flux density reference for the observations of sn  1979c .",
    "as expected for a `` secondary '' calibrator , the flux density of 1252 + 119 has been varying over the years , as can be seen in both table [ tab : cal ] and figure [ fig : cal ] .",
    "the flux density measurement error is a combination of the rms map error , which measures the contribution of small unresolved fluctuations in the background emission and random map fluctuations due to receiver noise , and a basic fractional error @xmath5 included to account for the normal inaccuracy of vla flux density calibration ( see , for example , weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) and possible deviations of the primary calibrator from an absolute flux density scale . the final errors ( @xmath6 ) as listed in table [ tab : data ]",
    "are taken as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the measured flux density , @xmath9 is the map rms for each observation , and @xmath10 for 20 , 6 , and 3.6 cm , and @xmath11 for 2 cm .",
    "table [ tab : data ] shows the new flux density measurements from 1991 july 28 through 1998 october 19 , while figure [ fig : lc ] shows a plot of all the available 20 and 6 cm data for sn  1979c from 1979 april 27 through 1998 october 19 , along with the best - fit model through 1990 december ( day @xmath12 ; weiler et al .  1992 ) .",

    "the solid line in figure [ fig : si ] is calculated from the best - fit model to the data through 1990 december and is not adjusted for the change in evolution since that time . the solid line in figure [ fig : spec ]",
    "is calculated for the best - fit spectrum using only data from the 1996 december 21 , 1998 february 10 , and february 13 observations , and may be represented as @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "this spectral index value is clearly flatter than both the best - fit spectral index after day 4,300 , @xmath16 , and the pre-1991 best - fit spectral index of @xmath17 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "even though for the new measurements since 1990 december @xmath18 ranges from about @xmath19 ( figure [ fig : si ] ) , the spectral index retains a completely optically thin , nonthermal character , at least over the wavelength range from 20 to 2 cm ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that , while the evolution of the radio emission ( and presumably the density structure of the csm ) has changed significantly since 1990 december , the best - fit spectral index , since becoming optically thin , has remained fairly constant with @xmath20 ( before day 4,300 ; figure [ fig : si ] ) and @xmath16 ( after day 4,300 ) , although short - term deviations such as that seen in figure [ fig : si ] ( @xmath21 ) appear to be real .",
    "the fluctuations seen in figure [ fig : lc ] in the 6 cm data ( relative to the fairly constant 20 cm data ) after day @xmath12 also appear to be real .",
    "this data was reduced independently by three ( and in some cases four ) of the authors , all with similar results .",
    "the fluctuations are not correlated with fluctuations in the secondary calibrator 1252 + 119 or vla array configuration .",
    "higher frequency observations which would assist in the interpretation of this data are , unfortunately , available on only two dates ( 1996 december 21 & 1998 february 13 ) and have no long - term monitoring values with which to compare .",
    "previous work on rsne ( see , e.g. , weiler et al",
    ".  1986 , 1991 ) has shown that the radio emission can be reasonably well described in its gross properties by a parameterized model of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond formally to the flux density ( in mjy ) and uniform absorption , respectively , at 5  ghz one day after the explosion date , @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the nonthermal spectral index of the synchrotron emission ; and @xmath28 is the decline rate of the radio emission after maximum .",
    "the term @xmath29 describes the attenuation of a local , external medium that uniformly covers the emitting source ( `` uniform external absorption '' ) and is assumed to be purely thermal , ionized hydrogen with frequency dependence @xmath30 . from the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model for radio emission from sne , this csm is assumed to have radial density dependence @xmath31 and to have been established by a constant mass - loss rate , @xmath32 , constant speed wind , @xmath33 , from a red supergiant progenitor .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 describes the time dependence of the optical depth for this local , uniform medium , and @xmath35 is specified in the chevalier model ( chevalier 1984 ) . for an undecelerated sn shock , @xmath36 is appropriate ( chevalier 1982a ) .",
    "chevalier ( 1982a ) also determined the dependence of the radio luminosity on the mass - loss rate ( @xmath32 ) and progenitor wind velocity ( @xmath33 ) or , equivalently , to the average csm density ( @xmath37 ) , as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the power law of the relativistic electron energy distribution and @xmath40 describes the time dependence of the self - similar evolution of the shock radius , @xmath41 . in this model , the magnetic energy density and the relativistic energy density both scale as the total post - shock energy density ( @xmath42 where @xmath43 ) , and both the magnetic field amplification efficiency and the particle acceleration efficiency remain constant as the sn evolves .",
    "weiler et al .  (",
    "1992 ) noted periodic features in the radio light curves of sn  1979c .",
    "since the spectral index was not affected by the observed flux density oscillations , they concluded that the variations were due to emission efficiency changes caused by modulations in the csm density structure , rather than being due to optical depth effects .",
    "they , therefore , introduced a modification to equation [ eq : s ] by multiplying the emission term @xmath24 by the sinusoidally - varying modulation @xmath44\\right\\}^{-(\\alpha + 2\\delta + 3)/2 } \\ .",

    "we are concerned with , @xmath51 , thus the fractional errors in @xmath52 are much smaller than @xmath53 . ] . the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 define the sinusoidal variation of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 represents the fractional amplitude of the density modulation",
    ", @xmath59 represents its frequency ( in cycles day@xmath60 ) , and @xmath55 represents its phase lag ( in radians ) .",
    "the best - fit model parameters to the pre-1991 ( @xmath61  days ) data are listed in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "this fit is slightly different from that of weiler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , due to improved fitting software , but agrees with that work to within the uncertainties . the errors in these new fitting parameters",
    "were estimated using a bootstrap procedure ( press et al .",
    "bootstrap procedures use the actual data sets to generate thousands of synthetic data sets that have the same number of data points , but some fraction of the data is replaced by duplicated original points .",
    "the fitting parameters are then estimated for these synthetic data sets using the same algorithms that are used to determine the parameters from the actual data .",
    "the ensemble of parameter fits is then used to estimate errors for the parameters by examining number distributions for the parameter in question .",
    "the errors in the fitting parameters in table [ tab : fit ] correspond to the values with 15.85% and 84.15% ( i.e. , @xmath62 for a gaussian distribution ) , respectively , of the cumulative distribution for each parameter .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : lc ] , the new measurements for sn  1979c since 1991 july 28 do not fit the model which described the data relatively well through 1990 december . since that time , the flux densities at all frequencies appear to have stopped declining and perhaps even started increasing . accepting our previous interpretation that a constant spectral index indicates an unchanged emission mechanism with constant efficiencies , this flattening implies that the shock wave of the sn is now interacting with a higher density structure in the csm .    under this scenario ,",
    "the flattening of the radio light curve may imply either the presence of denser circumstellar material (  [ sec : den ] ) , or perhaps a geometrical solution , such as the presence of a flared disc or ring (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "such dense shells or rings , similar to those we propose , are present around early type stars , as indicated by observations of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars ( see , e.g. , nota et al .",
    "1995 ) , the recent detections of rings around b type supergiants ( see , e.g. , brandner et al .",
    "1997 ) , and even by sn  1987a with its prominent circumstellar ring .",
    "another example of a sn surrounded by a circumstellar shell denser than a normal rsg wind is provided by sn  1978k , for which montes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found evidence of a constant free - free absorption that produces a characteristic low - frequency curvature in the typical synchrotron radio spectrum of the sn .",
    "the presence of a discrete shell of ionized gas surrounding sn  1978k has been confirmed by chu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) through spectroscopic measurements showing narrow h@xmath27 and [ n ii ] emission lines with widths and intensities characteristic of the environment around lbv stars .    additionally , there is evidence from optical observations of sn  1979c that the h@xmath27 and [ o i ] emission lines are also not decreasing , but have remained flat or perhaps increased slightly ( fesen et al .",
    "the optical emission arises from a different emission mechanism than the radio emission and at a different region of the sn shock , providing a separate line of evidence that sn  1979c has encountered a higher density region of the circumstellar medium .    furthermore , recent results from simulations of young snrs interacting with higher density clouds of varying sizes in an otherwise uniform csm ( jun & jones 1999 and references therein ) have shown that radio emission increases due to the increased ambient density and turbulent magnetic field amplification after a snr / cloud interaction begins .",
    "the simulations also showed changes in the efficiencies over time arising from the snr / cloud interaction , and how , in such interactions , the efficiencies , magnetic fields , and densities do not scale in the simple manner described by the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model .",
    "however , it must be noted that a change in the observed radio emission could be caused by a change in the efficiency of particle acceleration without significant csm density change . since the efficiency of particle acceleration is not well understood , an efficiency change may or may not cause a noticeable change in the spectral index .",
    "if we take the @xmath63 to be the ratio between the number of electrons that are accelerated to the total number of electrons , then @xmath63 is linearly proportional to the measured flux density . while we may not know @xmath63",
    ", we do know that the ratio of the measured flux density to that expected from the chevalier model .",
    "if we assume that _ only _ @xmath63 changes , while the densities and magnetic fields behave as expected from the chevalier model , then @xmath64 .",
    "this would require that the acceleration efficiency had remained roughly constant until @xmath12 days after explosion , then continually increase , being some @xmath65 greater by day @xmath66 than at day @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , given the optical evidence of an increase in the circumstellar density , which does not rely on particle acceleration , we interpret the deviation of the radio emission of sn  1979c from the previously assumed model as due to local density enhancement with the particle acceleration efficiency relatively unchanged .",
    "a denser csm may either be an isotropic shell or be in the form of condensations which have a small combined covering factor @xmath67 relative to the expanding shock front which is overtaking them .",
    "since the flux density increase at @xmath68 days is about a factor of 1.7 greater than that expected from the previous best - fit model ( weiler et al .",
    "1991 ) , and since the radio luminosity has a power - law dependence on the csm density ( @xmath69 , chevalier 1982a ) , the implied density enhancement is a factor of @xmath70 greater than the expected density for a @xmath71 constant mass - loss rate , constant velocity wind established csm .",
    "moreover , the increase relative to the best - fit model behavior is gradual with time , indicating a relatively smooth density distribution , which decreases with radius more slowly than the expected @xmath72 behavior . to produce an increase of density by a factor @xmath73 between 4,300 and 7,100 days a new radial density profile of approximately @xmath74 is required if @xmath75 , i.e. , for a uniform density distribution .",
    "if the density enhancement is the result of discrete features , whether a shell , condensations , or a ring , it is likely to fill a relatively limited fraction of the space around the sn progenitor , and to be present over a limited interval of radii ( @xmath76 ) . thus , this increase of radio emission could be a transient phase that disappears in a relatively short time .",
    "the argument for a limited duration to the increased radio emission , at least for a spherical geometry , is based on the plausible initial mass of the sn s rsg progenitor .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the radio emission at @xmath77 days ( table 3 ) imply a pre - sn mass - loss rate of @xmath78 if one adopts a pre - sn stellar wind velocity of @xmath79 , a shock velocity of 9,250 km s@xmath60 ( bartel 1991 ) , and an electron temperature ( @xmath80 ) of @xmath81 for the csm . at a sn shock velocity of @xmath82 , by 4,300 days after the explosion",
    "the front has reached a distance in the pre - sn wind , with assumed velocity 10 km s@xmath60 , where the material was lost from the star @xmath83 years before the explosion . at such a mass - loss rate ( @xmath32 ) and wind velocity ( @xmath33 )",
    "the csm , through which the shock has already passed , amounts to @xmath84 , a significant amount of material , even from a massive progenitor star .",
    "the additional matter present in the next layers , i.e. between 4,300 and 7,100 days , corresponds to another @xmath85 , making a total mass @xmath86 of swept - up csm by 1998 october . if the flux density continues to evolve in the present manner , the amount of engulfed matter increases rapidly : for example , in another 8 years ( i.e. , by the year 2007 ) the additional swept mass would be @xmath87 , giving a total swept - up mass of @xmath88 .",
    "such a swept wind mass is large , even for a red supergiant star , and it implies a very massive progenitor .",
    "estimates of the mass of the envelope ejected by sn  1979c range from @xmath89 ( chugai 1985 ) to @xmath90 ( branch et al .  1981 ; bartunov & blinnikov 1992 ; blinnikov & bartunov 1993 ) . in particular , in the models by bartunov & blinnikov ( 1992 ) for sn  1979c",
    ", the csm has a reasonable density profile , matching the observed @xmath59 light curves of sn  1979c quite well . adopting their value for @xmath91 , assuming a stellar remnant mass of @xmath92 , and using our above estimate for the current value of the swept - up mass , the initial mass of the progenitor",
    "must have been @xmath93 .",
    "assuming the current evolution of the flux density continues , by 2007 our estimate would rise to @xmath94 . while large , this is still consistent with the estimates of van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . from their hst imaging of the sn  1979c environment",
    ", they find that the stellar ages in that environment are consistent with the sn progenitor having an initial mass of @xmath95@xmath96 .      alternatively",
    ", the increase in flux density could be an effect of the geometry of the csm .",
    "it is conceivable that at small radii the csm was distributed in a disk with constant solid angle . at a radius of @xmath97 ( @xmath98 pc , the radius reached by a 9,250 km s@xmath60 shock after 4,300 days )",
    "the disk thickness increases so that it covers a larger solid angle , reaching about twice the initial solid angle by day 7,100 while maintaining a @xmath71 behavior .",
    "such a flared geometry would ease the mass requirement if the original disk subtended a relatively small angle ( @xmath99 ) and is at a large inclination angle , so as to be seen almost edge - on .",
    "in such a case the mass - loss rate determined by radio light curve fitting ( in which the rate is derived essentially from the free - free absorption of the csm ) would only be valid within the solid angle subtended by the disk , rather than over the full @xmath100 steradians .",
    "then , the mass engulfed by day 4,300 would be reduced by a factor @xmath101 and could be as small as @xmath102 of the estimates in the previous section , without making the requirement on the viewing inclination angle too severe . however , even in such a case , the flux density flattening observed since day 4,300 requires an increase of the interacting surface , so that the mass engulfed at later times increases at the same rate as the flux density does relative to the best - fit model . for example , if we take an initial solid angle of the disk to be @xmath103 , the mass swept by day 4,300 would be @xmath104 and the mass swept - up by day 7,100 would be an additional @xmath105 .",
    "more generally , if we denote with @xmath106 the fraction of solid angle subtended by the disk in the inner region , the mass swept by day 4,300 would be @xmath107 and the mass subsequently swept up by day 7,100 would be @xmath108 , a large , but much smaller amount than for the spherical shell case .",
    "a possible discriminant between the two basic possibilities , an increase of csm density or an increase of csm coverage , is the measurement of free - free absorption at low frequencies . for the case of flattening flux density due to a less rapidly declining ( as @xmath109 rather than @xmath71 ) csm density the emission measure will begin to decrease as em @xmath110 , while for the case of flattening flux density due to increasing coverage factor , the emission measure behavior will be either the same as , or steeper than the canonical stellar wind @xmath71 and could vary as much as em @xmath111 or more .",
    "in temporal terms , the differing density dependence of the em implies that up to 4,300 days the emission measure decreased as em@xmath112 and that for @xmath113 days its behavior changed to em@xmath114 .",
    "however , this behavior can only be tested at those frequencies where the optical depth was of the order of unity at 4,300 days , so that observations at lower frequencies than the 1.4 ghz will be required to distinguish between the two scenarios .    to estimate",
    "how low an observing frequency is required to see the difference , the best - fit model gives an optical depth of @xmath115 so that at 4,300 days the free - free optical depth was of the order of unity at 148  mhz and @xmath116 at 250  mhz .",
    "even 330  mhz observations at the vla are insufficient as they would probe an optical depth of only @xmath117 at day 4,300 .",
    "thus , testing these models may be impractical , since no high resolution , high sensitivity radio telescopes currently exist at such low frequencies .",
    "we have previously postulated that the csm around sn  1979c is highly structured ( weiler et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ) , and we and others have found evidence for a clumpy csm in sn 1986j ( weiler et al .",
    "1990 ) and sn 1988z ( van dyk et al .",
    "1993 ; chugai & danziger 1994 ) .",
    "we may also speculate that there is evidence for a dense clumpy medium surrounding sn  1979c from the fact that the 1.4 ghz flux densities at @xmath118 days remain relatively constant and consistently higher than predictions from the best - fit model , while the 5 ghz flux density values fluctuate from as low as the best - fit model extrapolation , to as high as @xmath119 times the 1.4 ghz flux densities , with a range of spectral indices from about @xmath120 ( as shown in figure 3 ) .",
    "these fluctuations appear real in that they greatly exceed the estimated measurement errors and seem to have a time scale of @xmath121 year . unfortunately , the paucity of observations in the 4,3007,100 day interval makes it hard to test this hypothesis in detail .",
    "if real , this 5 ghz fluctuation and 1.4 ghz stability could indicate a `` cooling '' time of @xmath122 year for the relativistic electrons responsible for the higher frequency emission and an appreciably greater time constant for lower energy electrons .",
    "this could be evidence for the presence of a relatively small number of dense clumps interspersed in the general , stellar wind - generated csm , but requires a cooling effect which is a very strong function of frequency .",
    "synchrotron and inverse compton losses scale only as @xmath123 , and coulomb losses as @xmath124 ( see , for example , the analysis of sn  1993j by fransson & bjrnsson 1998 ) , so that producing such a large variation in time scales over such a small frequency range by these mechanisms is very difficult .",
    "additionally , in order to produce such losses at all , synchrotron cooling would require magnetic fields @xmath125 g , much greater than the expected @xmath126 fields . unfortunately , there are too few measurements at 8.4 and 14.96 ghz ( only two at each frequency ) to determine if the fluctuations are also seen at higher frequencies .",
    "other evidence for dense clumps comes from the estimate of high densities ( @xmath127 ) derived by fesen et al.(1999 ) from optical and uv spectroscopy of sn  1979c .",
    "however , it is hard to assess the significance of their result , because their density estimate is based on a comparison of [ o ii ] and [ o iii ] line intensities measured at two epochs about 4 years apart , with the unverified assumption that the line fluxes do not change with time .",
    "additionally , the optical emission and radio emission probably arise from different physical media , making it difficult to directly compare the densities derived by fesen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with the radio results .",
    "chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) discriminated between equatorial disc and clump models for the case of sn  1988z by using the intermediate velocity component of the emission lines with fwhm of @xmath128 km s@xmath60 .",
    "fesen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) propose that the `` spiky '' profiles of several lines from sn  1979c are suggestive of clumpy emission regions , and individual spikes in the profiles of [ o i]@xmath1296300 and [ o ii]@xmath1297325 in their figure 5 have roughly the same velocity width as the lines used by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) for the case of sn  1988z .",
    "the possible presence of clumps in the csm and the reality of high frequency fluctuations should be tested .",
    "more frequent , multi - frequency radio observations ( @xmath130 every three months ) at a number of frequencies @xmath131 ghz might establish the nature of the apparent radio flux density fluctuations , and simultaneous optical / uv observations would permit an unambiguous determination of the gas density in the clumps .",
    "we have already begun more frequent monitoring of sn  1979c with the vla including both higher ( 8.4 & 14.9 ghz ) and lower ( 330 mhz ) frequencies .",
    "analysis of the radio emission from the type ii rsn  1979c at 20 and 6 cm from 1991 july 28 through 1998 october 19 , has shown that its radio emission has unexpectedly stopped decreasing in flux density and has flattened , or perhaps begun increasing , while maintaining a relatively constant spectral index .",
    "such behavior is in conflict with the best - fit model parameter predictions , based on an assumed @xmath132 csm established by a constant mass - loss rate , constant velocity wind from the pre - sn star .",
    "we interpret this `` flattening '' to indicate that the sn shock wave has encountered a new region of csm which was formed by the sn s progenitor @xmath133@xmath134 years before the sn explosion .",
    "interpretation of the data implies that this new region could either be a higher density shell , which should soon be crossed by the fast moving shock , or a `` flared '' disk - like structure in the csm , if the mass - loss were constrained to a narrow solid angle .",
    "additionally , rapid radio flux density fluctuations at 5 ghz , which are not present at 1.4 ghz , are interpreted as possible evidence for clumps or large scale density enhancements in the csm",
    ".    continued monitoring of sn  1979c at multiple radio frequencies  which is ongoing is needed to determine the form and duration of this new phase in the evolution of the radio light curves and , correspondingly , the structure of this new component of the csm . with the longest , relatively complete , multi - frequency data set available for the emission from any supernova , sn  1979c serves as a unique laboratory for understanding of the evolution of type ii supernova progenitors , their pre - sn mass - loss history , and their interactions with their local environments .",
