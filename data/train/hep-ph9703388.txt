    "one of the main physics goals of lep2 and future @xmath3 colliders is to directly test the gauge nature of couplings among the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the process with largest cross section at lep2 involving these couplings is the @xmath1pair production , @xmath4 , which is sensitive to the trilinear @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings .",
    "the measurement of these couplings and the sensitivity to possible deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions have been extensively studied in the recent years @xcite .",
    "the most general phenomenological parametrization for these couplings @xcite can be achieved by means of an effective lagrangian @xcite that involves operators with dimension higher than four , containing the relevant fields at low energies and respecting the symmetries of the standard model .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach is a model  independent way to describe new physics that can occur at an energy scale @xmath7 much larger than the scale where the experiments are performed .",
    "the effective lagrangian depends on the particle content at low energies and since the higgs boson has not yet been found , there are two logical possibilities to describe the new physics effect at low energies . in one of them ,",
    "the higgs boson can be light , being present in the higher dimensional operators , in addition to the electroweak gauge bosons , and the sm symmetries are linearly realized @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the higgs boson can be very heavy and it must be integrated out at low energies . in this case , the relevant fields at low energies are only electroweak gauge bosons and the sm symmetries are realized non - linearly @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a linearly realized @xmath8 invariant effective lagrangian to describe the bosonic sector of the standard model , keeping the fermionic couplings unchanged .",
    "the same effective lagrangian used to describe anomalous trilinear gauge couplings can , in general , lead to anomalous quartic interaction among gauge bosons and also to anomalous couplings of these particles with the higgs field .",
    "all these interactions should also be investigated at lep2 and at the next linear colliders ( nlc ) in order to search for hints about the nature of the new physics described by these higher dimensional operators .",
    "new quartic gauge boson couplings have been studied before in many different processes at future @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 colliders @xcite . however ,",
    "most of these previous works have focused on the so  called genuinely quartic operators , _",
    "i.e. _ operators that give rise only to quartic gauge boson interactions without altering the trilinear couplings @xcite .",
    "since these operators do not appear in a dimension6 linearly realized @xmath13 invariant effective lagrangian @xcite , they will not be considered here .",
    "anomalous higgs boson couplings have also been studied before in higgs and z boson decays @xcite , in @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath14 colliders @xcite .",
    "the process with largest cross section in @xmath3 colliders that also involves quartic couplings , and possibly anomalous higgs couplings , besides the trilinear couplings , is @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it is the most promising channel to look for possible deviations from the standard model predictions .",
    "this process has been considered by blanger and boudjema @xcite and by leil and stirling @xcite in the context of genuinely quartic operators , where the higgs and trilinear couplings were set to the standard model values and @xmath16 deviations in the total cross section were used to determine the reach of this reaction .",
    "knetter and schildknecht @xcite have considered the effect of a _ single _ higher dimensional operator usually denoted by @xmath17 ( see below ) in the above process , taking into account modifications on both trilinear and quartic couplings .",
    "however , they assumed that the higgs boson mass lies above the energy region to be investigated and therefore they disregarded its contribution .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the sensitivity to these anomalous couplings of the process @xmath0 at lep2 and the nlc .",
    "we consistently include in our calculations _ all _ new couplings introduced by the effective lagrangian that has become widely adopted to describe new physics beyond the standard model . in particular ,",
    "this process is sensitive to operators related to anomalous higgs boson couplings that do _ not _ affect the self  coupling of gauge bosons and hence are not constrained by the lep2 measurements of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath0 may provide important information about these operators at the nlc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ eff :",
    "lag ] , we review the framework of effective lagrangians that we use to parametrize anomalous couplings and explain the methodology used to study the @xmath19 production . in section [ lep ] , we analyze the sensitivity at lep2 based on the total cross section . in section [ nlc ] , we study the improvements arising from going to nlc energies , the effects of having a polarized electron beam , and the impact of being able to measure the @xmath1 boson polarization .",
    "we then concentrate on the analysis of operators which will not be probed by the @xmath4 process , obtaining limits based on the photon energy spectrum .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ con ] .",
    "in order to write down the most general dimension6 effective lagrangian containing all sm bosonic fields , _ i.e. _ @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , we adopt the notation of hagiwara _ et al .",
    "this lagrangian has eleven independent operators in the linear representation that are locally @xmath8 invariant , @xmath27 and @xmath28 even .",
    "we discard the four operators which affect the gauge boson two  point functions at tree  level and therefore are strongly constrained by lep1 measurements .",
    "we also do not consider the two operators that modify only the higgs boson self ",
    "interactions , since they are not relevant for our calculations .",
    "we are then left with five independent operators , and the lagrangian is written as , @xmath29 with each operator @xmath30 defined as , @xmath31 \\\\ { \\cal o}_{ww } & = & \\phi^{\\dagger } \\hat{w}_{\\mu \\nu }   \\hat{w}^{\\mu \\nu } \\phi \\\\ { \\cal o}_{bb } & = & \\phi^{\\dagger } \\hat{b}_{\\mu \\nu }   \\hat{b}^{\\mu \\nu } \\phi \\\\ { \\cal o}_{w }   & = & ( d_{\\mu } \\phi)^{\\dagger }   \\hat{w}^{\\mu \\nu } ( d_{\\nu } \\phi ) \\\\ { \\cal o}_{b }   & = & ( d_{\\mu } \\phi)^{\\dagger }   \\hat{b}^{\\mu \\nu } ( d_{\\nu } \\phi ) \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the higgs field doublet , which in the unitary gauge assumes the form , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the field strength tensors of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 gauge fields respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath39 contributes only to anomalous gauge couplings , @xmath40 and @xmath41 contribute only to anomalous higgs couplings , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whereas @xmath44 and @xmath45 give rise to both types of new couplings .",
    "therefore , the existence of anomalous trilinear gauge couplings could be related to the anomalous quartic gauge couplings and higgs interaction , which are the subject of our investigation .",
    "studies of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings from @xmath1pair production will significantly constrain combinations of the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however they are  blind \" with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we chose to study the reaction @xmath0 since it is the process with the largest cross section involving triple , quartic gauge boson couplings and also anomalous higgs  gauge boson couplings .",
    "therefore , it is also sensitive to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , offering an excellent possibility for a detailed study of these couplings .    the standard model cross section for the process @xmath51 was evaluated in ref .",
    "when we neglect the electron mass , higgs contributions for this reaction do not appear at tree level since the couplings @xmath52 and the @xmath53 are generated only at one loop @xcite . taking into account these contributions , there are 16 feynman diagrams involved in the reaction @xmath0 , which are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( the crossed diagrams are not shown ) which yields , @xmath54 where we have required that the angle between any two particles is larger than @xmath55 .",
    "the cross section peaks at roughly @xmath56 gev and is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the two  body process @xmath4 , used to constrain anomalous trilinear couplings .    in order to compute the contribution from all possible anomalous couplings ,",
    "we have developed a mathematica code to automatically generate the feynman rules for the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) that were then incorporated in helas ",
    "type @xcite subroutines .",
    "these new subroutines were used to extend a madgraph @xcite generated code to include all the anomalous contributions and to numerically evaluate the helicity amplitudes and the squared matrix element . in our calculations , we have taken into account the standard loop higgs contributions besides all the relevant anomalous couplings , which give rise to the 42 contributions shown in fig.[fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] , and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "we have checked that our code passed the non  trivial test of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "we employed vegas @xcite to perform the monte carlo phase space integration with the appropriate cuts to obtain the differential and total cross sections .",
    "moreover , we have studied the angular variables in order to find optimal cuts to improve the anomalous contribution over the sm signal .",
    "we studied the reaction @xmath0 at lep2 assuming a center  of  mass energy of @xmath57 and an integrated luminosity of @xmath58 .",
    "we applied a cut in the photon energy ( @xmath59 ) , and we required the angle between any two particles to be larger than @xmath60 .    our results for the sensitivity of lep2 to the operators appearing in the effective lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) , from an analyses of the total cross section , are summarized in fig.[fig:4 ] for a fixed value of the higgs boson mass , @xmath61 gev .",
    "we plot the contributions of the 5 different operators separately , assuming that only one operator contributes each time .",
    "we also show the result for an extension of the so  called hisz scenario @xcite , where all the coefficient are considered equal , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath62 , in order to reduce the number of free parameters to only one ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the standard model cross section and its value with 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath64 deviations are depicted as horizontal lines .    the most sensitive contribution comes from @xmath39 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "a 1@xmath64 deviation in the total cross section would be observed for the following ranges of the coefficients of these operators , for @xmath65 tev , @xmath66 whereas for the extended hisz scenario , we have , @xmath67    of course , the operators that also give rise to changes in the triple vector boson couplings can also be constrained at lep2 via the reaction @xmath4 .",
    "a recent analyses of @xmath1boson pair production based on a log  likelihood fit to a five  fold differential cross section obtained the 1@xmath64 limits @xcite , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that this reaction is insensitive to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and therefore the study of the process @xmath71 can provide further information on these operators , as we show in this paper .    the contribution of the anomalous couplings involving only the higgs boson , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see fig.[fig:3 ] ) , is dominated by on  mass  shell higgs production with the subsequent @xmath72 decay , @xmath73    for large values of the operator coefficients , the total higgs width is dominated by the anomalous decay @xmath74 @xcite , which is also proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 . on the other hand , the anomalous width @xmath75 depends only on @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the anomalous coupling @xmath50 is much less sensitive than the contributions from the other operators since @xmath76 becomes almost independent of this coefficient .",
    "fortunately , this is not the case if one is sensitive to small values of the coefficients , as will occur at the nlc study in the next section .",
    "we have investigated various distributions to try to improve the lep2 sensitivity .",
    "the most promising distribution is the angular distribution of the @xmath1 bosons with respect to the beam direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "we computed the total cross section with the extra cut @xmath77 , as suggested by this distribution , and found an increase in sensitivity from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "however , due to the small deviations in the shape of the kinematical distributions and small statistics , no further improvement seems to be possible .",
    "the effect of the anomalous operators becomes more evident with the increase of energy , and we are able to put tighter constraints on the coefficients by studying their contribution to different processes at the next linear collider .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of nlc to the process @xmath0 assuming @xmath80 and an integrated luminosity @xmath81 .",
    "we adopted a cut in the photon energy of @xmath82 and required the angle between any two particles to be larger than @xmath55 .",
    "we have analyzed this process for different values of the higgs boson mass .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we show the results for the total cross section , for @xmath83 , including the effects of the anomalous operators .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath63 s for which a @xmath84 deviation is obtained are shown in table [ tab:1 ] , being typically of the order of @xmath85 tev@xmath86 .",
    "as we could expect , the @xmath1pair production at nlc is able to put a limit that is one order of magnitude better for the coefficients @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "however this latter reaction is _ not _ able to constraint @xmath88 .    in an attempt to increase the sensitivity",
    ", we looked at the effects of a @xmath89 polarized electron beam in order to reduce the sm background , mainly the one coming from diagrams of fig.[fig:1]a and [ fig:1]b were just left  handed electrons are present .",
    "we have considered both left  handed ( lh ) and right  handed ( rh ) polarizations , expecting a larger anomalous sensitivity for rh electrons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , we show the results for the total cross section , for a @xmath89 right  handed ( rh ) polarized electron , for @xmath90 gev . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and fig.[fig:7 ] , we notice that the effect of the anomalous contributions in the total cross section are larger for the polarized case",
    ". however , the small absolute value of the cross section for the polarized case reduces the statistics and leads to no improvement in the established limits , as shown in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "since we expect the new interactions to involve mainly longitudinally polarized gauge bosons , we studied the sensitivity for different combinations of the polarizations of the @xmath91pair . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , we show the analogous of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for the @xmath92 case .",
    "again , the effect of the anomalous contributions to the total cross section is increased , but no further improvements are found due to the small statistics . the results for the bounds on the anomalous coefficients for the @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 cases can be seen in table [ tab:3 ] .",
    "these bounds were obtained requiring a 2@xmath64 effect on the total cross section .",
    "it is important to notice that the kinematical distributions of the longitudinally polarized @xmath1 s are quite different from the sm results .",
    "as we could expect , the new physics effects becomes more evident for longitudinal @xmath1 s since the decay @xmath96 is dominated by this state of polarization . in fig.[fig:9 ] , we present the angular distribution of the longitudinal @xmath97 boson with the initial positron and with the final photon , the energy and the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "we can see , for instance , that the @xmath1 energy distribution is very different from the sm prediction .",
    "its characteristic behavior for @xmath98 gev is due to the presence of the higgs boson , which decays into the @xmath1 pair giving rise , at the same time , to a monochromatic photon .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] the percent deviation of the sm prediction in the photon transverse momentum distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath99 for the different polarization of the @xmath1 s",
    ". once again the relevance of the @xmath92 case is evident : @xmath100 for @xmath101 gev .",
    "when a cut of @xmath102 gev is implemented , the background is drastically reduced and the ratio of anomalous over sm events per year goes from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , for @xmath105 tev@xmath86 .    using the reaction @xmath0 , we are also able to establish bounds on the values of the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for which the @xmath1pair process is insensitive , since they only affect the higgs boson couplings . in fig.[fig:11 ] , we present the results of a combined sensitivity analysis in the form of a contour plot for the two free parameter , @xmath50 and @xmath49 , for @xmath90 gev .",
    "these are the most relevant coefficients for the anomalous higgs boson phenomenology and they are not constrained by the @xmath91pair production .",
    "we should keep in mind that the @xmath5 production at lep2 can put a 1@xmath64 bound on @xmath49 ( [ bound : lep ] ) while it is not possible to impose a limit on @xmath50 since the cross section is quite insensitive to this coefficient .",
    "if the higgs boson is found with a mass in the range from 170 to 300 gev , one would have a large sensitivity for the anomalous higgs couplings @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the photon energy distribution of the process @xmath0 .",
    "this increased sensitivity comes about because the existence of a peak in the photon energy spectrum due to the @xmath106body nature of the dominant contribution , _ i.e. _ @xmath107 followed by the subsequent decay @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig:3 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] , we illustrate this effect with a typical photon energy distribution , for @xmath108 tev@xmath86 and @xmath90 gev , where the higgs peak appears very clearly in the photon spectrum of the anomalous contribution .    in order to analyse the significance of the signal based on the photon energy spectrum",
    ", we took different energy bins of @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 gev .",
    "the reason is to roughly mimic the effects of a realistic simulation including the finite energy resolution of the detector and the small spread in the real center  of  mass energy due to initial state radiation .",
    "we have not considered the experimental efficiency , @xmath112 , for @xmath1 reconstruction .",
    "it can be easily incorporated by multiplying the obtained significances by @xmath113 .",
    "table [ tab:4 ] shows the improvement on the sensitivity compared to the total cross section analysis for the @xmath114 tev@xmath86 and @xmath115 case .    in table",
    "[ tab:5 ] , we present our results for the sensitivity on @xmath116 and @xmath117 , assuming @xmath50 = @xmath49 , for the three energy bins above .",
    "we obtained a sensitivity of the order of a tev@xmath86 for @xmath118 , decreasing by a factor of roughly four for @xmath119 , which does not depend in a significant way of the bin size . for larger higgs boson masses ,",
    "the cross section is reduced due to phase space suppression . for smaller higgs boson masses ,",
    "the cross section is reduced since the higgs boson is off  mass  shell , and in this case it would be better to study processes like @xmath120 or @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the search for the effect of higher dimensional operators that give rise to anomalous bosonic couplings should be pursued in all possible processes since the results may provide important information on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have studied here the production of a @xmath1pair plus a photon in @xmath3 colliders in order to analyse the contributions of anomalous couplings arising from dimension6 operators of a linearly realized @xmath8 invariant effective lagrangian .",
    "we have included _ all _ the anomalous trilinear and quartic gauge couplings , as well as the anomalous higgs couplings with gauge bosons .",
    "we present the limits attainable at lep2 and at nlc , including the standard model irreducible background .",
    "polarization of the electron beam and of the @xmath1pair are found to be insufficient to improve the limits obtained from the total cross section .",
    "we also focused on the operators @xmath40 and @xmath122 , which can not be tested in the @xmath91pair production process .",
    "we showed , in particular , that for higgs boson masses in the range @xmath123@xmath124 , the photon energy spectrum provides a sensitive signature for the anomalous higgs couplings .",
    "typical sensitivities of a few tev@xmath86 at the nlc are obtained for these coefficients , providing complementary information on different higher dimensional operators .",
