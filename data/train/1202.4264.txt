    "melnikov theory studies the fate of homoclinic and periodic orbits of two - dimensional dynamical systems when they are periodically perturbed ; see for instance @xcite for an introduction to the subject .",
    "the problem can be stated as follows .",
    "consider in @xmath0 a dynamical system of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 ` sufficiently smooth ' , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5-periodic in @xmath6 for some @xmath7 and @xmath8 a small parameter , called the _",
    "perturbation parameter_. if @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for a suitable function @xmath11 , the unperturbed system is hamiltonian .",
    "assume that for @xmath12 the system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) admits a homoclinic orbit @xmath13 to a hyperbolic saddle point @xmath14 and that the bounded region of the phase space delimited by @xmath15 is filled with a continuous family of periodic orbits @xmath16 , @xmath17 , whose periods tend monotonically to @xmath18 as @xmath19 . because of the assumptions , it is easy to see ( as an application of the implicit function theorem ) that for @xmath20 small enough",
    ", the system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) admits a hyperbolic periodic orbit @xmath21 .",
    "then one can ask whether the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath22 intersect transversely ( in turn if this happens it can be used to prove that chaotic motions occur ) . another natural question is what happens to the periodic orbits @xmath16 when @xmath20 .",
    "in particular one can investigate under which conditions ` periodic orbits persist ' , that is there are periodic orbits which are close to the unperturbed ones and reduce to them when the perturbation parameter is set equal to zero . if such orbits exist , they are called _ subharmonic _ or _ resonant _ orbits .",
    "both the existence of transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath22 and the persistence of periodic orbits are related to the zeroes of suitable functions .",
    "more precisely if one define the _ melnikov function _ as @xmath23 then if @xmath24 has simple zeroes the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath22 intersect transversely , while if @xmath25 for all @xmath26 no intersection occurs ; essentially @xmath24 measures the distance between the two manifolds along the normal to the homoclinic orbit at @xmath27 . concerning the periodic orbits ,",
    "if the period @xmath28 of @xmath16 is not commensurable with the period @xmath5 of the functions @xmath29 , in general such an orbit will not persist under perturbations . otherwise , set @xmath30 and define the _",
    "( subharmonic ) melnikov function _ as @xmath31 if @xmath32 has a simple zero then admits a subharmonic orbit @xmath33 with period @xmath34 ; in particular , if the functions @xmath2 are analytic , then @xmath33 is analytic in both @xmath8 and @xmath6 . if there are no zeroes at all , no periodic solution persists .",
    "the proof of the claims above is rather standard and it is essentially based on the application of the implicit function theorem . a possible approach for the case of subharmonic orbits consists in splitting the equations of motion into two separate sets of equations , the so - called _ range equations _ and _ bifurcation equations _ : one can solve the range equations in terms of the free parameter @xmath35 and then fix the latter by solving the bifurcation equations , which represent an implicit function problem .",
    "the assumption that the zeroes of the melnikov function are simple corresponds to a ( generic ) non - degeneracy condition on the perturbation .",
    "when the zeroes are not simple , the situation is slightly more complicated . in the case of subharmonic orbits ,",
    "the same result of persistence extends to the more general case of zeroes of odd order @xcite , and interesting new analytical features of the solutions appear @xcite ; indeed the subharmonic solutions turn out to be analytic in a suitable fractional power of @xmath8 rather than @xmath8 itself . on the other hand",
    "if the zeroes are of even order one can not predict a priori the persistence of periodic orbits . finally , if the melnikov function is identically zero , one has to consider higher order generalisations of it and study the existence and multiplicity of their zeroes to deal with the problem @xcite .    if one considers a quasi - periodic perturbation instead of a periodic one , that is @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , one can still ask whether there exist hyperbolic sets run by quasi - periodic solutions with stable and unstable manifolds which intersect transversely and one can still study the existence of quasi - periodic solutions which are `` resonant '' with the _ frequency vector _",
    "@xmath40 of the perturbation ; see below ",
    "after ( [ eq:1.4 ] )  for a formal definition of resonant solution for quasi - periodic forcing .    also in the quasi - periodic case , non - degeneracy assumptions are essential to prove transversality of homoclinic intersections .",
    "existence of a quasi - periodic hyperbolic orbit close to the unperturbed saddle point and of its stable and unstable manifolds follows from general arguments , such as the invariant manifold theorem @xcite , without even assuming any condition on the frequency vector @xmath40 .",
    "palmer generalises melnikov s method to the case of bounded perturbations @xcite using the theory of exponential dichotomies @xcite . a suitable generalisation of the melnikov function for quasi - periodic forcing is also introduced by wiggins @xcite .",
    "he shows that if such a function has a simple zero then the stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversely .",
    "then , generalising the smale - birkhoff homoclinic theorem to the case of orbits homoclinic to normally hyperbolic tori , he finds that there is an invariant set",
    "on which the dynamics of a suitable poincar map is conjugate to a subshift of finite type ; in turn this yields the existence of chaos .",
    "similar results hold also for more general almost periodic perturbations ( which include the quasi - periodic ones as a special case ) : meyer and sell show that also in that case the dynamics near transverse homoclinic orbits behaves as a subshift of finite type @xcite and scheurle , relying on palmer s results , finds particular solutions which have a random structure @xcite ; again , to obtain transversality the melnikov function is assumed to have simple zeroes .",
    "such assumption can be weakened to an assumption of `` topological non - degeneracy '' ( i.e. the existence of an isolated minimum or maximum of the primitive of the melnikov function ) as in the case of subharmonic orbits , and one can deal with the problem by use of a variational approach ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "a natural application for the study of homoclinic intersections , widely studied in the literature , is the quasi - periodically forced duffing equation @xcite .",
    "often , especially in applications , the frequency vector is taken to be two - dimensional , with the two components which are nearly resonant with the proper frequency of the unperturbed system ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then a different approach with respect to @xcite is proposed by yagasaki @xcite : first , through a suitable change of coordinates , one arrives at a system with two frequencies , one fast and one slow , and then one uses averaging to reduce the analysis of the original system to that of a perturbation of a periodically forced system for which the standard melnikov s method applies : the persistence of hyperbolic periodic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds for the original system is then obtained as a consequence of the invariant manifold theorem .",
    "transversality of homoclic intersections plays also a crucial role in the phenomenon of arnold diffusion @xcite : non - degeneracy assumptions on the perturbation are heavily used in the proofs existing in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) in order to find lower bounds on the transversality , which in turn are fundamental to compute the diffusion times along the heteroclinic chains ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a physically relevant case , studied within the context of arnold diffusion , is that with frequency vectors with two fast components @xcite or with one component much faster and one component much slower than the proper frequency ( ` three scale system ' ) @xcite . in such cases",
    "the homoclinic splitting is exponentially small in the perturbation parameter and this makes the analysis rather delicate , as one has to check that the first order contribution to the splitting ( the melnikov function ) really dominates ; in particular non - degeneracy conditions on the perturbation are needed once more .",
    "the problem of existence of quasi - periodic orbits close to the center of the unperturbed system is harder and does not follow from the invariant manifold theorem .",
    "second - order approximations for the quasi - periodic solutions close to the centers of a forced oscillator are studied in @xcite , using the multiple scale technique for asymptotic expansions @xcite .",
    "but if one wants to really prove the existence of the solution , one must require additional assumption on @xmath40 to deal with the presence of _ small divisors_. in @xcite , moser considers duffing s equation with a quasi - periodic driving term and assumes that ( i ) the system is _ reversible _ , i.e. it can be written in the form @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , and there exists an involution @xmath43 such that @xmath44 ( so that with @xmath45 also @xmath46 is a solution ) , and ( ii ) the frequency vector of the driving satisfies some diophantine condition involving also the proper frequency of the unperturbed system linearised around its center .",
    "then he shows that there exists a quasi - periodic solution , with the same frequency vector as the driving , to a slightly modified equation , in which the coefficient of the linear term is suitably corrected .",
    "if one tried to remove the correction then one should deal with an implicit function problem ( see @xcite for a similar situation ) , which , without assuming any non - degeneracy condition on the perturbation , would have the same kind of problems as in the present paper .",
    "quasi - periodically forced hamiltonian oscillators are also considered in @xcite , where the persistence of quasi - periodic solutions close to the centers of the unperturbed system is studied , including the case of resonance between the frequency vector of the forcing and the proper frequency .",
    "however , again , non - degeneracy conditions are assumed .    on the contrary the problem of persistence of quasi - periodic solutions far from the stationary points , corresponding to the subharmonic solutions of the periodic case ,",
    "does not seem to have been studied a great deal .",
    "( we can mention a paper by xu and jing @xcite , who consider duffing s equation with a two - frequency quasi - periodic perturbation and follow the approach in @xcite to reduce the analysis to a one - dimensional backbone system ; however the argument used to show the persistence of the two - dimensional tori is incomplete and requires further hypotheses . ) again the existence of resonant solutions is related to the zeroes of a suitable function , still called melnikov function by analogy with the periodic case . if the zeroes are simple , assuming some diophantine condition on @xmath40 , the analysis can be carried out so as to reach conclusions similar to the periodic case , that is the persistence of resonant solutions . in this paper",
    "we study the same problem in the case of zeroes of odd order and additionally investigate what can still be said when the melnikov function is identically zero .",
    "as remarked before , considering non - simple zeroes means removing non - degeneracy  and hence genericity  conditions on the perturbation .",
    "this introduces nontrivial technical complications , because one is no longer allowed to separate the small divisor problem plaguing the range equations from the implicit function problem represented by the bifurcation equations .",
    "the method we use is based on the analysis and resummation of the perturbation series through renormalisation group techniques @xcite ; for other renormalisation group approaches to small divisors problems in dynamical systems see for instance @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", the frequency vector of the perturbation will be assumed to satisfy the _ bryuno condition _ ; such a condition , originally introduced by bryuno @xcite , has been studied recently in several small divisor problems arising in dynamical systems @xcite . with respect to @xcite",
    ", we consider here also non - hamiltonian systems : what is required on the unperturbed system is a non - degeneracy condition on the frequency map of the periodic solutions ( _ anisochrony condition _ ) . in the hamiltonian case ,",
    "such a condition becomes a convexity condition on the unperturbed hamiltonian function , analogously to cheng s paper @xcite , where the fate of resonant tori is studied . in the hamiltonian case , the main difference with respect to @xcite  and what prevents us from simply relying on that result  is that we consider isochronous perturbations ( while in @xcite the unperturbed hamiltonian is convex in all action variables ) and assume a weaker diophantine condition on the frequency vector of the perturbation ( the bryuno condition instead of the standard one ) .",
    "furthermore , as we said , our method covers also the non - hamiltonian case , where cheng s approach , based on a sequence of canonical transformations _",
    " la _ kam , does not apply . in the hamiltonian case",
    ", we do not require any further assumption on the perturbation ( besides analyticity ) , as in @xcite . in the non - hamiltonian case we shall make some further assumptions .",
    "more precisely we shall require that some zeroes of odd order appear at some level of perturbation theory and a suitable positiveness condition holds ; see section [ sec:1 ]  in particular hypotheses [ hyp3 ] and [ hyp4 ]  for a more formal statement .",
    "of course , one could also investigate what happens if the non - degeneracy condition on the unperturbed system is completely removed too .",
    "however , this would be a somewhat different problem and very likely a non - degeneracy condition could become necessary for the perturbation . not even in the kam theory for maximal tori ,",
    "the fully degenerate case ( no assumption on the unperturbed integrable system and no assumption on the perturbation , besides analyticity ) has ever been treated in the literature  as far as we know .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we consider systems of the form ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) and assume that for @xmath12 there is a family of periodic solutions satisfying the same hypotheses as in the case of periodic forcing .",
    "in fact the analysis we will be interested in will be essentially local , so we can allow a more general setting and assume that , in suitable coordinates @xmath47 , with @xmath48 an open subset of @xmath49 , the unperturbed system reads @xmath50 with @xmath51 analytic and @xmath52 ( anisochrony condition ) . as a particular case we can consider that @xmath53 are canonical coordinates ( action - angle coordinates ) , but the formulation we are giving here is more general and applies also to non - hamiltonian unperturbed systems ; see also @xcite .",
    "then we add to the vector field a small analytic quasi - periodic forcing term with frequency vector @xmath54 which satisfy some weak diophantine condition ( bryuno condition ) and concentrate on a periodic solution of the unperturbed system which is resonant with @xmath40 , that is a solution with @xmath55 such that @xmath56 for suitable integers @xmath57 . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we state formally our two main results on the persistence of such a solution : theorem [ thm:2.2 ] takes into account the case in which the system is not assumed to be hamiltonian and a zero of odd order appears at some order of perturbation theory , while theorem [ thm:2.3 ] deals with the case in which the system is hamiltonian and no further assumption is made on the perturbation . in sections",
    "[ sec:3][sec:5 ] we shall prove theorem [ thm:2.2 ] . as we shall see , the quasi - periodic solution will be only continuous in the perturbation parameter .",
    "in fact , in contrast to the case of periodic perturbations , in general the quasi - periodic solution is not expected to be analytic in @xmath8 nor in some fractional power of @xmath8 ; already in the non - degenerate anisochronous hamiltonian case the solution has been proved only to be @xmath58 smooth in @xmath8 @xcite and analyticity is very unlikely . in section [ sec:6 ]",
    "we shall prove theorem [ thm:2.3 ] : we shall see that either ( a ) one is able to reduce the analysis to theorem [ thm:2.2 ] or ( b ) suitable `` cancellations '' occur to all orders in the perturbation series formally defining the solution . in particular we shall see how the hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion is fundamental in order to prove such cancellations . in turn",
    "this will imply , in case ( b ) , the convergence of the perturbation series and hence the existence of a solution which is analytic in the perturbation parameter : we stress since now that this is a highly non - generic  and hence very unlikely  possibility .",
    "the cancellation mechanism turns out to be quite similar to the one performed in @xcite , where moser s modifying terms theorem @xcite is proved by using cartesian coordinates instead of action - angle coordinates",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the deep reason of such a similarity .",
