    "despite the great success of the standard model ( sm ) , it offers no explanation of the origin of fermion flavor , or of the existence of three families .",
    "the flavor physics of the third family is particularly mysterious for the smallness of the mixing angles and the huge hierarchy in masses . in this letter",
    ", we consider a model @xcite based on the gauge symmetry g=  @xmath21 .",
    "the third generation of fermions ( top quark , @xmath22 , bottom quark , @xmath23 , tau lepton , @xmath24 , and its neutrino , @xmath25 ) experiences a new gauge interaction , instead of the usual weak interaction advocated by the sm . on the contrary",
    ", the first and second generations only feel the weak interaction supposedly equivalent to the sm case .",
    "the new gauge dynamics is attributed to the @xmath26 symmetry under which the left - handed fermions of the third generation transform in the fundamental representation ( doublets ) , while they remain to be singlets under the @xmath27 symmetry . on the other hand , the left - handed fermions of the first and second generation",
    "transform as doublets under the @xmath27 group and singlets under the @xmath26 group .",
    "the @xmath28 group is the sm hypercharge group .",
    "the right - handed fermions only transform under the @xmath29 group as assigned by the sm . finally the qcd interactions and the color symmetry @xmath30",
    "are the same as that in the sm .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry - breaking of the group @xmath31 is accomplished by introducing two scalar matrix fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are assigned as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( the scalar doublet @xmath33 carries equivalent quantum numbers as the sm higgs doublet . )",
    "we assume that the first stage of symmetry breaking is accomplished through the @xmath36 field by acquiring a vacuum expectation value @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 the second stage is through the scalar @xmath39 field by acquiring a vacuum expectation value @xmath40 , so @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is at the same order as the sm symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "because of this pattern of symmetry breaking , the gauge couplings are related to the @xmath42 gauge coupling @xmath43 by the relation @xmath44 we can define @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the usual weak mixing angle and @xmath47 is a new parameter of the model .    to derive the mass eigenstates and physical masses of the gauge bosons , we need to diagonalize their mass matrices . for @xmath48 ( equivalently @xmath49 )",
    ", we require @xmath50 ( which implies @xmath51 ) so that the perturbation theory is valid .",
    "similarly , for @xmath52 , we require @xmath53 . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on the region where @xmath54 is much larger than 1 , and ignore the corrections which are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath55 . to the order @xmath55 , the light gauge boson masses are found to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 . while for the heavy gauge bosons , one finds @xmath58 up to this order , the heavy gauge bosons are degenerate in mass because they do not mix with the hypercharge gauge boson field .",
    "the first and second generation fermions acquire their masses through the yukawa interactions to the @xmath39 doublet field , while the third generation fermion masses have to be generated through higher dimension operators .",
    "given the fermion mass matrices , one can derive their physical masses by diagonalizing the mass matrices using bilinear unitary transformations .",
    "for example , in terms of the fermion mass eigenstates , we have the interaction terms : @xmath59 \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } d_l \\\\   s_l \\\\   b_l \\end{array }",
    "\\right ) w_\\mu ^{+}\\,+h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath60 \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } d_l \\\\",
    "s_l \\\\   b_l \\end{array } \\right ) z_\\mu \\ , , \\label{qu2}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are unitary matrices needed to diagonalize the up and down quark matrices , respectively , and @xmath63    for the charged - current interactions in the quark sector , one observes that in the case of ignoring the new physics effect , quark mixing is described by a unitary matrix @xmath64 which is identified as the usual cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix . with the inclusion of new physics",
    ", the mixing acquires an additional contribution proportional to @xmath65 , with @xmath66 therefore , we would expect the extracted values of the ckm matrix elements to be slightly modified due to the new contributions of the model .    in this model",
    ", lepton mixing is an exciting possibility .",
    "however , the almost vanishing partial decay widths of @xmath67 and @xmath68 have severely suppressed any possible mixing between the first and second family leptons .",
    "since the lepton number violation processes involving the third family are not as well constrained , and the mixing strength between leptons may be directly related to their masses , we assume in this paper that lepton flavor mixing is only allowed between the second and the third family .",
    "the strength of the lepton flavor mixing in this model is parametrized by @xmath69 .",
    "the minimal mixing corresponds to @xmath70 , and a maximal mixing implies @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , flavor mixing can exist in the neutrino sector despited that neutrinos are massless , which may induce an interesting effect to the neutrino oscillation phenomena .",
    "as to be shown later , quark mixing must be present in the model , although lepton mixing is merely a possibility . hence , flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are unavoidable in the quark sector . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the effect of the new physics predicted by this model to low - energy experiments , as well as the constraints derived from the present data on the parameter space of the model .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the changes in the relevant physical observables relative to their sm values to leading order in @xmath55 .",
    "namely , any observable @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the sm prediction including the one - loop sm correction , and @xmath75 represents the new physics effect to leading order in @xmath55 . using the most recent lep and slc measurements @xcite ( including the total width of the @xmath1 boson @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , the vector @xmath80 and the axial - vector @xmath81 couplings of the electron , the ratios @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , the hadronic cross section @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) , and the sm predictions of the above observables @xcite , we find that the precision @xmath1-pole data requires the heavy gauge boson mass to be larger than about @xmath96 tev at the @xmath3 level , and the parameter @xmath97 to be larger than 20 for @xmath98 . in figure 1 ( solid curve )",
    "we show the minimal @xmath99 mass as a function of @xmath100 at the @xmath3 level , assuming no mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "the @xmath1-pole observable that imposes the most stringent constraint on the model is @xmath79 , which is the ratio of the partial decay widths of @xmath1 boson into the @xmath101 and the hadronic modes .",
    "the measurement of @xmath76 also plays an important role secondary to @xmath79 , especially for small @xmath100 , due to the high precision of data .",
    "we find that @xmath97 can be as small as 20 for the smallest allowed value of @xmath100 ( @xmath102 ) , and it increases as @xmath100 increases .",
    "furthermore , the quantity @xmath103 is constrained by data to be less than about @xmath104 for a large range of @xmath100 . as also shown in figure 1 ( dotted curve ) , without including the leptonic observables from the @xmath1-pole data , the bounds on @xmath105 and @xmath97 is about 900 gev and 5 , respectively .",
    "( in this case , the important constraint is coming from the measurement of @xmath91 . )",
    "if a mixing between @xmath5 and @xmath4 is allowed , we also need to include the limit on the branching ratio of @xmath106 from lep / slc data @xcite . in figure 1 ( dashed curve )",
    ", we depict the new constraints on @xmath100 and @xmath105 for @xmath107 .",
    "we find that the lower limit on the heavy mass is reduced to @xmath108 tev .",
    "the reason for this slightly lower bound is due to the reduced non - universal effect in @xmath79 .",
    "we find that for the smallest allowed value of @xmath109 , the value of @xmath97 can be as low as 20 , which is similar to the case of @xmath110 .",
    "the reason is that for small values of @xmath100 ( @xmath111 ) , the measurement @xmath76 , which is independent of the mixing angle @xmath112 , plays the important role in constraining the parameter @xmath97 .",
    "again , the quantity @xmath103 is found to be less than about @xmath113 .",
    "even though the @xmath1-pole data already impose significant constraints , this model has a rich structure that can be further examined at much lower energy scales . in the following sections",
    ", we would like to examine those constraints obtained from the low - energy hadronic , leptonic , and semi - leptonic data .",
    "we will concentrate on the very low - energy regime , i.e. , physics at zero - momentum transfer , and examine whether the parameters of the model can be better constrained than those imposed by lep and slc data . for clarity",
    ", we shall separately discuss below the effects from the lepton and quark sectors to lepton number violation phenomena , as well as to kaon and bottom physics .",
    "it is easy to see that if the third family lepton does not mix with the first family lepton , then the partial decay width of @xmath114 and @xmath115 will not be modified .",
    "however , if the lepton mixing involves the third family , then the lifetime of the @xmath24 lepton will be modified .",
    "the only modification to the total decay width , to the order @xmath55 , is coming from the partial decay width @xmath116 .",
    "we find @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a phase factor @xcite given by @xmath119    after comparing with data @xcite , we find that the above ratio constrains the parameter @xmath120 . also the lepton number violation process @xmath121 provides the constraint @xmath122 consistent with the above measurement .",
    "therefore , the above two measurements give a stronger constraint than the @xmath1-pole data for @xmath123 . on the other hand , giving its present experimental limit , the decay process @xmath124 has not yet played a significant role .",
    "nevertheless , if the above discussed decay widths can be measured to a better accuracy in future experiments , they can further test the proposed model .",
    "hereafter , when discussing the predictions of our model to low - energy processes , we will consider @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath107 .      to completely describe the interactions of gauge bosons and quarks , it requires two mixing matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 because both the up- and down - type quarks are massive .",
    "as noted in eq .",
    "( [ qu2 ] ) that the neutral - current mixing matrices ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) are related to the charged - current mixing matrix ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "because of the experimental evidence of the ckm matrix in charged currents , fcncs must occur in this model between the interaction of quarks and gauge bosons , and can be realized in three different ways : ( i ) in the down - quark sector only , ( ii ) in the up - quark sector only , and ( iii ) in both sectors .",
    "all these three possibilities have to confront the existing low - energy data . in the following , we investigate these three possibilities , separately .",
    "first , we consider the case that only down - type quarks can mix , so that @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "this implies that fcnc processes are completely determined by the ckm matrix @xmath133 , in addition to @xmath134 and @xmath97 .",
    "since the matrix elements of @xmath135 are naturally small , we generally do not expect large effects in fcnc processes . under the assumption that the @xmath4 lepton does not mix with the electron @xmath43 ,",
    "the decay width of @xmath136 is not modified at tree level .",
    "however , @xmath137 will be modified through the fcnc interaction @xmath138 . the expected branching ratio , normalized to the predicted branching ratio for @xmath139 , can be written as @xmath140 for @xmath141 , we find that @xmath142 is a few times larger than the sm prediction . in the above result we summed over all neutrino flavors , therefore , the @xmath112 dependence cancels .",
    "furthermore , since the above observables do not depend on the parameter @xmath100 , they can directly constrain the parameter @xmath97 of the model .",
    "the effect to the @xmath143-@xmath144 mixing is of the same order as the sm prediction , which can only be useful if the long distance contribution can be better understood theoretically .",
    "this model also predicts non - standard effects for bottom physics . the important process to consider is @xmath145-@xmath146 mixing where new effect is expected to occur at tree level . after substituting all the relevant variables by their numerical values , we find @xmath147 given the constraint on @xmath97 ( @xmath148 ) imposed by the @xmath1-pole data , without lepton flavor mixing ( i.e. , @xmath149 )",
    ", the new contribution can be a few times of the sm predictions . in the case",
    "that @xmath4 and @xmath5 mix with the maximal strength ( i.e. , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , the new contribution to @xmath145-@xmath146 mixing is expected to be less than @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , our model predicts tree - level contribution to the process @xmath153 , whose branching ratio , when normalized by @xmath154 , is given as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "the typical size of the predicted branching ratio is listed in table 1 . another interesting process to consider is the decay @xmath158 . at tree level ,",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath159 using the values @xmath160 , @xmath109 , @xmath161 gev , and @xmath162 gev @xcite , we find that the current data on the branching ratios of @xmath163 does not impose a better constraint on the model than that by the @xmath1-pole data .",
    "since this model also predicts the non - sm decay modes , such as @xmath164 and @xmath165 , with comparable branching ratios , they should be measured to test the model prediction on the lepton flavor mixing dynamics ( i.e. , @xmath112 dependence ) . as a summary to this scenario , in table 1",
    "we tabulate the predictions of our model for various processes in two cases : ( i ) @xmath126 and @xmath141 , ( ii ) @xmath107 and @xmath166 . for both cases we set @xmath109",
    ".    under the scenario that only up - type quarks can mix , there will be no non - standard effect present in the hadronic decays of @xmath10 , @xmath167 and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "this is because in the pure hadronic interaction , the new physics effect is only expected in processes that @xmath168 vanishes , i.e. , the number of @xmath23 quark must be the same in the initial and final states of a reaction .",
    "it is easy to see that new effects in the charged - current semi - leptonic decays are only expected in the @xmath23-quark system . as an example",
    ", it can modify the decay branching ratio of @xmath169 and @xmath170 to be @xmath171 where all the three lepton ( including neutrino ) flavors are included .",
    "( note that the @xmath112 dependence cancels . ) however , with @xmath172 , imposed by the @xmath1-pole data , we do not expect the new physics effects to exceed @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore , the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix will be modified , but its change is extremely small for the values of @xmath97 that agree with @xmath1-pole data . at one - loop level ,",
    "the @xmath143-@xmath144 , @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing and the decay width of @xmath174 can be modified , but the one - loop effects are generally small and do not exceed the level of @xmath175 compared with the sm prediction . although fcnc decay of charm meson is expected to be modified at tree level , the non - standard effect is again small because of the natural suppression imposed by the fcnc couplings ( which are the products of ckm matrix elements ) .",
    "the only suspected new effect in the @xmath23-quark system is through the @xmath176 decay , which proceeds through @xmath177 .",
    "we find the expected maximal deviation in the ratio @xmath178 is less than @xmath179 for @xmath125 .",
    "it vanishes for the maximal lepton mixing scenario , i.e. for @xmath107 , and the partial decay width of @xmath176 into the @xmath180 has to be measured to test this scenario .    under the general mixing scenario ,",
    "the model requires two additional free ( real ) parameters , which can be chosen to be any two of the 31 , 32 and 33 elements ( i.e. , @xmath181,@xmath182 and @xmath183 ) of the @xmath62 mixing matrix , although additional phases can be introduced to generate a new source of cp violation .",
    "( note that the unitarity condition of the matrix @xmath62 requires @xmath184 . )",
    "it turns out that depending on the values of the parameters , sizable effects in various fcnc processes are expected . in table 2",
    ", we summarize the results under this scenario by giving the constraints on the mixing parameters , extracted from various experiments .",
    "similar to the discussions given for the other two scenarios , the general mixing scenario also allows lepton number violation processes , such as @xmath185 and @xmath164 .",
    "since their branching ratios are of the same order as those for the @xmath186 mode , they can be very useful for further testing the model .",
    "finally , we note that in the sm neither @xmath61 nor @xmath62 can be separately determined , and only the ckm matrix @xmath133 , which is the product of @xmath187 and @xmath62 , can be measured experimentally .",
    "however , in this model , the elements in the third column of the @xmath188 mixing matrices can be determined , and can be further constrained by including the other low - energy data . in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the current low energy data ( including the @xmath1-pole data ) still allows the third family fermions to have different gauge interactions from the first and the second family fermions , though the mass of the heavy gauge bosons in this case has to be larger than 1.7 tev . fortunately ,",
    "as summarized in tables 1 and 2 , many of the predicted new effects of this model can be further tested at the tau / charm , kaon and bottom factories .",
