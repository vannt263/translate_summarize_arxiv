    "with the advent of space infrared missions in the last two decades , the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution has undergone a dramatic advance . prior to this",
    ", the state of knowledge concerning the subject had been critically limited to the information which could be obtained mainly from the ultraviolet and optical ( e.g. , lilly et al.1995 , 1996 ; madau et al .",
    "1996 ) . while such studies allowed for some significant advances in the understanding of these processes , the sparsity of detailed information from the infrared presented a major obstacle to any significant further progress .",
    "the relative importance of the infrared , with regard to galaxy evolution , derives primarily from the fact that the majority of light emitted by nascent stars , in the characteristically dusty star - forming regions of galaxies , is reprocessed by the surrounding dust and re - emitted at infrared wavelengths ( see , e.g. , calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , a great deal of the information concerning star formation , its history , and hence galaxy evolution , is expected to be encoded in the infrared . in the local universe",
    ", such infrared emission is known to constitute about one third of the total light emitted from galaxies ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) . however , as can be inferred from the cosmic background light , this contribution increases significantly with redshift , accounting for half of the total energy produced by extragalactic sources , and is due to a corresponding increase in dust - obscured star formation and/or accretion activity ( dole et al .  2006 ;",
    "puget et al .  1996",
    "; see also hauser & dwek 2001 for a review ) .    with the launch of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) in january 1983 ,",
    "a number of studies of faint sources provided the first evidence for evolution in the infrared galaxy population ( hacking , condon & houck 1987 ; lonsdale et al .",
    "1990 ) . however , it was nt until the launch of the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) that the first detailed studies of the deep universe were undertaken , providing new insights on galaxy evolution based on higher redshift sources .",
    "in particular , discoveries such as the excess of faint sources with respect to no - evolution models , measured in the 15  number counts ( e.g. , elbaz et al .  1999 ; flores et al .  1999 ; lari et al .  2001 ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2003 ) , led to several evolutionary models for infrared galaxies ( see , e.g. , franceschini et al .",
    "2001 ; chary & elbaz 2001 ; lagache et al .",
    "in addition , an initial attempt was also made with iso to study the 15  local luminosity function ( pozzi et al .",
    "however , the success of this study was somewhat hampered by the insufficient quality of the data for the task , and by limited redshift information .",
    "more recently , the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ opened the door to further advances and discoveries , with its significantly improved detector technology , providing both better resolution and sensitivity ( werner et al .",
    "the first survey to be performed by _ spitzer _ ,",
    "the public first look survey ( fls ) , included an extragalactic component which consisted of shallow observations of a 4.4 sq .  deg .  field , centered at @xmath8 = 17@xmath918@xmath1000@xmath11 , @xmath12 = 593000 .",
    "the observations were obtained using the four infrared array camera ( irac ) channels ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the three multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) bands ( rieke et al .",
    "an important aspect of the fls was that it was also augmented by a large pool of ancillary data .",
    "specifically , the survey was complemented at other wavelengths by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) observations , obtained in several optical bands ( hogg et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ; fadda et al .  2004 ) ; by deeper optical and near - infrared imaging , obtained with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and the 200 inch telescope at palomar ( shim et al .  2006",
    "; glassman et al .  2007 , in preparation ) ; by imaging of the same field with both the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) ( see , e.g. , bridge et al.2007 ; damjanov et al .  2006 ) ; and finally , by 1.4  ghz radio data , obtained with the very large array ( vla ) , contributing the deepest radio survey in such a wide area to date ( condon et al .  2003 ) .",
    "some of the new science made possible by this survey included the estimation of the 24  galaxy number counts ( marleau et al .",
    "2004 ) and the mmt / hectospec redshift survey of papovich et al.(2006 ) .",
    "galaxy evolution was inferred from the 24  counts measured in the fls and other deep _ spitzer _ surveys ( marleau et al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et al .",
    "2004 ) , and this led to a revision of existing models ( e.g. , lagache et al .",
    "following the fls , other _ spitzer _ surveys were conducted to study the infrared galaxy population .",
    "for example , the 24  luminosity function was constructed in the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey ( babbedge et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) and hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) surveys ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    ". however , an important limitation of these studies was the fact that they were based completely on photometric redshift determination , and so lacked the reliability of spectroscopic surveys .",
    "indeed , although multi - wavelength imaging provides a wealth of information regarding the nature of extragalactic sources , spectroscopic observations are in the end necessary to probe deeper into the nature of these sources , by providing a more accurate and detailed determination of the chemical properties , redshift distributions , luminosity functions , star - formation rates and evolutionary effects .",
    "the survey presented in this paper , which we shall now detail , aimed at doing just that .",
    "our program of observations and research commenced in 2002 , prior to the august 2003 launch of _ spitzer _ , with follow - up optical spectroscopy , using the hydra spectrograph on the wiyn telescope at kpno , and continued through until 2005 .",
    "the first sources to be targeted by our survey were radio sources detected with the vla at 1.4  ghz . based on the infrared - radio correlation ( see , e.g. , dickey & salpeter 1984 ; de jong et al .",
    "1985 ; helou et al .",
    "1985 ; condon & broderick 1986 ) , we expected these sources to be infrared - bright sources and , therefore , to be detected by _",
    "spitzer_.    a study of the galaxy radio population offers the additional advantage that radio emission does not suffer from extinction and , therefore , is a more accurate tracer of both star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity .",
    "the 1.4  ghz luminosity function of star - forming galaxies and agns is well known only for the relatively local universe ( e.g. , condon , cotton & broderick 2002 ; sadler et al .",
    "in fact , very little is known about the evolution of the radio luminosity function as , until recently , the deepest large scale radio survey reached 2.5  mjy .",
    "moreover , attempts at measuring evolution of the radio luminosity function have remained inconclusive due to large uncertainties ( machalski & godlowski 2000 ) .",
    "after the fls observations were completed in december 2003 , we targeted the infrared sources detected at 24  with mips .",
    "the database of optical spectra we present in this paper provides a firm basis for the study of the bright end of the 1.4  ghz and 24  luminosity function , and can also be used , for example , as the training set for photometric redshifts estimation , using the neural network method ( see , e.g. , collister & lahav 2004 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : wiyn observations and data reduction are presented in section  2 , spectral analysis and completeness of the survey are discussed in section  3 , measurement of emission lines , diagnostic diagrams and star formation rates are presented in section  4 , luminosities and the infrared - radio correlation are computed in section  5 , and in section  6 , luminosity functions at 1.4  ghz and 24  are derived .",
    "section  7 describes how to access the database of the wiyn / hydra spectra .",
    "finally , section  8 summarizes the main results of the paper .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath13 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "our wiyn / hydra target sample was selected from two datasets of sources detected in the fls .",
    "the first set was comprised of sources detected at 1.4  ghz and with an r - band magnitude @xmath16 . this set was used during our 2002 and 2003 observing runs , prior to the _ spitzer _ launch ( 2003 august 25 ) .",
    "the second set was constructed from the 24  sources , using the same r - band magnitude cut .",
    "these were targeted during our 2005 observing run after the _ spitzer _ observations of the fls were completed ( 2003 december 9 - 11 ) . a few companions of 1.4  ghz and 24  sources were also part of the sample .",
    "our list of targets was divided into 15 separate pointings ( see table  [ tbl : fields ] ) .",
    "each hydra field covered a circular area 0.9 degrees in diameter , as shown in figure  [ fig : fields ] .",
    "note that some of the fields seen in figure  [ fig : fields ] are overlapping . in these fields ,",
    "the source density was larger than the maximum number of allowed fibers and therefore these regions were observed more than once .",
    "optical spectra of the selected radio and infrared galaxies were obtained with the hydra multi - object spectrograph on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "hydra has a total of 288 fiber positions ( numbered @xmath17 ) , distributed evenly around the focal plate with every third position being a red fiber .",
    "of these @xmath18 98 red fibers , only 93 were working properly at the time of our observations .",
    "each red fiber was assigned a target by taking into account a minimum fiber - to - fiber placement distance of 37 arcsec .",
    "the fibers in each field were assigned to either a target , the sky , or a guide star . on average ,",
    "ten fibers were assigned to the sky in each pointing .",
    "an additional set of eleven fibers were available for guide stars .",
    "target selection was carried out by running the assignment code _",
    "whydra_. the code optimized fiber placement based on a set of user - defined weights , subject to a set of fiber placement rules . once at the telescope , the instrument program _",
    "hydrawiyn _ made the final assignment of fibers to targets .",
    "we found that typically , @xmath19 fibers were assigned to selected survey targets in each field .",
    "multi - fiber spectroscopy , using 2 arcsec diameter fibers , required that the relative errors of the target coordinates be better than 0.5 arcsec . to achieve this precision , we used coordinates from the sdss and the kpno r - band images ( fadda et al .",
    "the relative errors in these optical catalogs were less than 0.1 arcsec .",
    "also important was the choice of guide stars , as at least three stars were selected for each configuration .",
    "we selected guide stars with magnitudes @xmath20 from the tycho2 catalog ( h@xmath21 g et al .",
    "the coordinates had an absolute position error less than 60  milliarcseconds , allowing for accurate acquisition and guiding .",
    "our sample was observed on the nights of 2002 august 14 - 15 , 2003 june 30-july 01 , and 2005 july 17 .",
    "we selected the @xmath22  band and the red fiber set to observe emission lines from [ oii ] @xmath233727 to h@xmath4 @xmath236563 , for typical objects in our sample ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the red fiber set , combined with the bench spectrograph camera , was optimized for the @xmath25  wavelength range .",
    "however , because of the presence of strong sky lines , the spectra redward of @xmath187500  were not usable .",
    "the size of the fibers was ideally suited for our sample as each fiber covered a significant portion of a target .",
    "we used a grating with 316  lines / mm and a blaze angle of 7 degrees , yielding a dispersion of 2.64  pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the final resolution , measured from the fwhm of comparison lines , was @xmath18 5 .",
    "exposure sets of 3@xmath2620 minutes were used for all fields . for each configuration we took dome flats and cu - ar comparison lamp exposures for wavelength calibration . between each field observation",
    ", we took exposures of spectroscopic standard stars for flux calibration .",
    "a total of 772 spectra were obtained .",

    "the 24  sources in the fls catalog of fadda et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and those targeted with wiyn / hydra are also shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] ( right ) .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using a combination of tasks run with the interactive data language ( idl ) and the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "first , we created average dome flats and comparison arc lamps for each configuration and an average bias for each night .",
    "images were then trimmed and the bias was subtracted .",
    "next , we identified the hot pixels , caused by cosmic ray hits , by subtracting consecutive images and using the _ la_cosmic _ task ( van dokkum 2001 ) . after identifying these bad pixels , we coadded all the images relative to one configuration by averaging their values and discarding the masked pixels",
    ".    further processing of the science frames was done using the hydra reduction package _ dohydra _ ( valdes 1995 ) , which is specifically designed for the reduction and spectral extraction of the hydra multi - fiber spectra .",
    "the package allows one to extract the spectra , compute and apply a flat - field and fiber throughput correction , calibrate in wavelength and subtract the sky .    to flux calibrate the spectra ,",
    "the typical approach is to fit the spectrum of the standard star with a high - order polynomial .",
    "however , this removes the fine - scale features , found especially in the red part of the spectrum , making the detection of the h@xmath4 emission lines of medium - redshift objects very difficult .",
    "therefore , to calibrate in flux , we used a different method .",
    "we filtered the spectrum of the standard star , divided by the library spectrum , with a multiscale transform ( see , e.g. , fadda , slezak & bijaoui 1998 ) .",
    "this method removes the high - frequency noise and conserves the significant short - scale features . the obtained response function",
    "was then applied to the spectra .",
    "the analysis of the spectra , including redshift and line measurements , was carried out using an idl code written by the authors .",
    "examples of the reduced spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the redshifts of the infrared and radio sources in our wiyn survey were calculated by identifying spectral features ( see section  4 below ) and taking the average .",
    "when no lines were present and the 4000 - break was detected , the location of the break was used to determine the redshift . of the 772 spectra , we measured redshifts for 498 extragalactic sources . of these , eight were broad emission line objects  one of which was at @xmath27 ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] )  and eleven were stars .",
    "we were able to identify lines in 395 sources , whereas a redshift based on the 4000 - break was obtained for 72 sources .",
    "the features were flagged as `` break '' , `` emission '' , or `` absorption '' .",
    "we visually identified the spectroscopic classification as either `` galaxy '' , `` broad emission line '' , or `` star '' , and assigned each target with a redshift quality assessment value of `` unknown '' , `` tentative '' or `` good '' .",
    "the results of the wiyn / hydra spectroscopic survey are given in an ascii table , available in the electronic edition of the _ astrophysical journal _",
    ", with the format explained in table  [ tbl : speccat ] .",
    "our final wiyn / hydra redshift catalog consists of 382 radio and 412 infrared emitters , of which 322 sources are both .",
    "there are also fifteen sources with redshifts that have neither 24  nor 1.4  ghz flux densities ( within the flux limits of the surveys ) .",
    "these are close companions of radio or infrared sources that make up a pair , and for which we wanted to obtain both redshifts .",
    "to increase the completeness of our survey at lower redshift , we queried the release 5 of the sdss archive for the fls region ( 17@xmath907@xmath10 @xmath28 17@xmath929@xmath10 , 5821@xmath29 6034 ) .",
    "a total of 812 sources with sdss redshifts were retrieved . of those ,",
    "70 sources were identified as wiyn / hydra sources as well , allowing us to do a redshift comparison for a sub - sample of objects .",
    "we found excellent agreement between the wiyn / hydra and sdss spectroscopic redshifts , with only two cases where the redshifts are significantly ( @xmath30z@xmath31-z@xmath32 @xmath33 0.01 ) discrepant . given that these sources were classified as `` tentative '' under our quality index , we assigned the sdss redshifts to these objects .",

    "the discrepant 15% of the matched sources fell either under the `` tentative '' quality assessment or had their redshift estimated from the `` 4000 - break '' , which is likely less reliable than identifying features .",

    "following equation  ( 28 ) of condon , cotton & broderick ( 2002 ) , we can write    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the measured radio luminosity in w hz@xmath3 , and the sfr@xmath55 is given in m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the more massive stars in normal galaxies are responsible for most of the radio emission .",

    "the star formation rate computed from the radio luminosity is on average consistent with the one derived from the h@xmath4 optical line emission .",
    "the star formation rates start to deviate slightly from this simple correlation at the upper end of the sfr range , as the optical extinction increases ( see figure  [ fig : sfr ] , left ) , and therefore the h@xmath36 flux measurement becomes more uncertain .",
    "moreover , we do nt necessarily expect a perfect agreement between the two methods as the current radio emission is proportional to the rate of massive star formation occuring during the past 100  myr , whereas the h@xmath4 line emission is associated with more recent , i.e.  @xmath50  myr , star - forming activity .",
    "the star formation rates are plotted as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : sfrz ] . at low redshift ( @xmath56 ) , our survey is detecting sources with a wide range of star - forming activity . however , at higher redshifts , we are only detecting sources with a sfr @xmath57 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "radio and infrared luminosities were calculated for a total of 830 radio sources and 1753 24  sources .",
    "the observed radio flux densities were corrected to the rest - frame flux densities by applying a multiplicative factor of @xmath58 , assuming a power law emission of @xmath59 at these frequencies .",

    "was computed using redshifted spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates .",
    "the majority of 24  sources are star forming galaxies , but their seds are not known a priori . however ,",
    "if fluxes are also measured at other wavelengths , such as 4.5 , 24 and 70  , it becomes possible to select a best fit sed from a database of seds , such as the one of siebenmorgen & krgel ( 2007 ) , and compute a correction specific to each source . to see if we could apply this technique , we used the 70  source catalogs of frayer et al .",
    "unfortunately , only 22% of all sources with measured redshifts were detected at 70  .",
    "with most of the 24  population unknown , and with luminosities in the range of normal star - forming galaxies , we therefore elected to use the sed of the typical starburst galaxy m82 as our template for calculating the k - correction ( data from sturm et al .",
    "we obtained identical results when using the average irs spectrum of 13 starburst galaxies ( brandl et al .",
    "2006 ) . as can be seen in figure  6 of brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this is not surprising , as this average irs spectrum and the m82 sed are virtually the same at these wavelengths .",
    "however , extreme sources , such as high redshift luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and agns , are not expected to be well represented by this template . to estimate the error on the luminosity calculations at the bright end of the luminosity function of star forming galaxies , we re - computed the k - correction using two additional templates : ugc  5101 ( data from armus et al .",
    "2007 ) , a typical ulirg , and arp  220 ( data from sturm et al.1996 ) , one of the most extreme objects of this type ( see figure  2 of armus et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the 24  luminosities computed using the m82 and arp  220 templates differed by @xmath61  % , over the redshift range of our survey .",
    "the difference was even less when comparing to our typical ulirg , ugc 5101 .",
    "similarly , the impact on the measurement of q@xmath5 ( see below ) was found to be insignificant ; using arp  220 , we found a difference of 0.8  % in the median and 0.2  % in the dispersion .",
    "the use of m82 for the k - correction was therefore found to be completely adequate for our sample .",
    "moreover , this result is consistent with the work of appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who performed a comparison between the k - correction computed from best fit model seds and the sed of m82 .",
    "we stress , however , that this assumption is likely to break down at higher redshifts , i.e.  @xmath62 , when differences in the seds start to have a large impact on the 24  flux densities . as for the agns identified in our sample , the circinus galaxy , a seyfert 2 object ,",

    "we plotted the optical extinction as a function of 1.4  ghz and 24  luminosity for the 134 wiyn / hydra sources with measured h@xmath4 and h@xmath36 fluxes .",

    "the monochromatic 24  infrared - radio correlation can best be plotted as a function of redshift by computing the parameter    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the flux density in the 24  band and at 1.4  ghz , respectively .",
    "the median value of q@xmath5 is a measure of the slope of the infrared - radio correlation , whereas the dispersion is related to the strength of the correlation for the given sample of galaxies . for our wiyn / hydra sources , the 1.4  ghz and 24  raw flux densities , i.e.  no k - correction applied ,",

    "this is not too surprising as there is some overlap between our sample and the one of appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , although the latter is derived mostly from keck / deimos redshifts ( see choi et al .",
    "2006 ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : q24 ] ( right ) , we can see that there is clearly a population of radio - loud agn objects which falls off the correlation .",
    "these sources were not classified as optical agns .",
    "they are possibly buried agns , or sources that have not been corrected properly using the m82 template for the 24  luminosity calculation .",
    "the former explanation is most probably correct , as this population is also seen when the raw flux densities are plotted ( figure  [ fig : q24 ] , left ) .",
    "we also note a slight tendancy for the radio - quiet agns to lie below the average correlation , i.e.  higher q@xmath5 ( see figure  [ fig : q24 ] , left ) .",
    "this effect , however , is less noticeable when the k - correction is applied ( see figure  [ fig : q24 ] , right ) .",
    "it is not clear how significant this is , since the k - corrected 24  flux densities depend on the assumed infrared sed , mostly for the high redshift sources .",

    "nevertheless , a preliminary estimate of the incompleteness correction at low redshift is presented here .",
    "we queried the sdss archive for photometric redshifts in the fls region .",
    "a total of 58321 sources with sdss photometric redshifts were retrieved .",
    "we matched our 24  and 1.4  ghz source lists with the sdss photometric redshift catalog and found 8441 and 2348 matches , respectively . as the sdss photometric redshift catalog is contaminated by agns , we corrected the luminosity function with added photometric redshifts by applying a correction factor , derived from the measured fraction of agns per luminosity bin in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lf ] as the dotted lines .",
    "as we are less complete at 1.4  ghz than at 24  ( see figure  [ fig : zfracvla ] and [ fig : zfrac24um ] ) , the completeness correction is more important in the radio .",
    "both luminosity functions are split into the redshift bins @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , to investigate evolution in the 24  and 1.4  ghz sample ( see figure  [ fig : lfz ] ) .",

    "the 1.4  ghz luminosity function derived for the redshift bin @xmath100 agrees well with the 1.4  ghz local luminosity function of condon , cotton & broderick ( 2002 ) and sadler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at the bright end , and is larger at fainter luminosities .",
    "this difference can be explained by the lower flux density limit of our survey ( 0.09  mjy compared to 2.5  mjy ) .",
    "moreover , the greater depth of our radio survey , compared to previous surveys , allows us to present the first 1.4  ghz luminosity functions at high redshift ( see figure  [ fig : lfz ] ) .",
    "luminosity evolution over the redshift range @xmath101 is clearly detected in both 1.4  ghz and 24  luminosity functions , as shown in figure  [ fig : lfz ] .",
    "this is very interesting as it shows that the infrared and radio galaxy populations were forming stars more actively in the past , like the ultraviolet and optical populations ( e.g. , lilly et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; madau et al .",
    "1996 ) , and that therefore this increase in activity at earlier times appears to be a generic property of galaxies .",
    "we also make use of the @xmath102 method ( schmidt 1968 ) to test the evolution of the uniformity of the space distribution of sources .",
