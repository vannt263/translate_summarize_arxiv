    "this work is motivated by emerging experiments with cold divalent atoms mg , ca , sr and yb  @xcite .",
    "for example , the recently attained bose - einstein condensate of the ground - state yb @xcite may offer new insights into the physics of degenerate quantum gases due to a vast number of available isotopes and relative simplicity of molecular potentials .",
    "as to the @xmath8 metastable states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : levels ] ) , it was realized that the non - scalar nature of the @xmath8 states may be used to overcome the unfeasibility of magnetic trapping of the spherically - symmetric @xmath9 ground states  @xcite .",
    "knowing radiative lifetimes of the other , @xmath10 , metastable states is required in developing the next generation of ultraprecise optical atomic clocks  @xcite . here",

    "the hyperfine quenching predominantly is caused by the admixture of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states . ]    for all _ bosonic _ isotopes of mg , ca , sr , and yb , the nuclear spin @xmath15 vanishes and these isotopes lack hyperfine structure . for bosonic isotopes",
    "the @xmath10 state may decay only via very weak multi - photon ( e.g. , e1-m1 ) transitions .",
    "however , for _ fermionic _ isotopes ( table  [ tab : nucparams ] ) , @xmath16 , a new radiative decay channel becomes available due to the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) .",
    "the hfi , although small , admixes atomic levels of the total angular momentum @xmath17 thus opening an electric - dipole branch to the ground state .",
    "the resulting hfi - induced e1 decays do determine the lifetimes of the @xmath10 states .",
    "as to the @xmath8 states , here the single - photon decays are allowed , but being of non - e1 character , are very weak .",
    "the lifetimes are long and range from 15 seconds for yb to 2 hours for ca  @xcite . as we demonstrate here",
    ", depending on an isotope , the hyperfine quenching of the @xmath8 states is either comparable to or is much faster than the small non - e1 rates .    .",
    "nuclear parameters of the stable fermionic isotopes of mg , ca , sr , and yb .",
    "here @xmath15 are the nuclear spins and @xmath18 are the nuclear magnetic moments expressed in units of the nuclear magneton @xmath19 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to summarize , here we employed the relativistic many - body methods to evaluate the hyperfine quenching rates for the metastable @xmath0 and @xmath1 states of mg , ca , sr , and yb",
    ". the tabulated rates may be useful for designing novel ultra - precise optical clocks and trapping experiments with fermionic isotopes of metastable alkaline - earth atoms and yb .",
    "the resulting natural widths of the @xmath2 clock transition are 0.44 mhz for @xmath3 mg , 2.2 mhz for @xmath4ca , 7.6 mhz for @xmath5sr , 43.5 mhz for @xmath6yb , and 38.5 mhz for @xmath7yb . compared to the bosonic isotopes ,",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath1 states in fermionic isotopes is noticeably shortened by the hyperfine quenching but still remains long enough for trapping experiments .",
