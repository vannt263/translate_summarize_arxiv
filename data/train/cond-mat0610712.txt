    "gross refers this situation  as a _",
    "cathastrophe _ of the legendre transformation @xcite .",
    "thus , the existence of an ensemble inequivalence associated to the convexity of the microcanonical entropy leads to a significant lost of information when the canonical description is performed instead the microcanonical description : the gibbs canonical ensemble is unable to describe the system features during the phase coexistence , i.e. the existence of a non vanishing interphase tension @xcite .    _ summarizing _ : the concavity of the boltzmann entropy is a necessary condition for the ensemble equivalence and the validity of the legendre transformation @xmath91 between the thermodynamic potentials which supports the applicability of the well - known thermodynamic formalism in the conventional thermodynamics .",

    "the existence of the multimodal character of the canonical energy distribution function under the presence of first - order phase transitions is the origin of the phenomenon of critical slowing down in the neighborhood of the critical point during the monte carlo simulations based on the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] .      as already discussed in the subsection above",
    ", the concavity of the microcanonical entropy is a very important condition within the conventional thermodynamics .",
    "however , the consideration of the reparametrization invariance leads naturally to the _ ambiguous character of the concavity of the microcanonical entropy _ : the concave or convex character of a scalar function like the entropy depends crucially on the parametrization used for describe it .",
    "let us consider a trivial example .",
    "let @xmath55 be a positive real map defined on a seminfinite euclidean line @xmath94 , @xmath95 , which is given by the concave function @xmath96 in the coordinate representation @xmath97 of  @xmath94 ( where @xmath98 ) .",

    "an analogue situation was used by ruppeiner  for establish a riemannian interpretation of the thermodynamics in the ref.@xcite ( see in appendix [ ruppeiner ] ) .",
    "reader may object correctly that such ambiguity of the concave character of the entropy is irrelevant within the conventional thermodynamics because of the only one _ admissible _ representation @xmath104 in this framework is the total energy , @xmath105 .",
    "this viewpoint follows directly from the fact that most of applications of the equilibrium statistical mechanics start from the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] ( or more general , from the _ boltzmann - gibbs distributions _ ) .",
    "however , it is necessary to recall that the reparametrization invariance is only relevant in the microcanonical description since the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] is not reparametrization invariant .",
    "their different background physical conditions are crucial : the microcanonical ensemble describes an isolated system while the gibbs canonical ensemble describes the same system with a weak interaction with a thermostat , that is , an open system .    at first glance ,",
    "the above ambiguity suggests us that _ the first - order phase transitions associated with the existence of convex regions of the entropy could not be a phenomenon microcanonically _ _ relevant due to the reparametrization invariance of this ensemble_. this preliminary idea contradicts our common sense educated in the everyday practice where the phase coexistence is a very familiar phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , most of these experiences are observed under those background conditions which lead to the applicability of the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] .",
    "we shall demonstrate in the next subsection that this ensemble can be generalized in order to develop a thermodynamic framework where the reparametrization invariance plays a more fundamental role than in the conventional thermodynamics .",
    "the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] belongs to a family of equilibrium distribution functions called the _ boltzmann - gibbs distributions _",

    "although the boltzmann - gibbs distribution functions play a fundamental role in most of applications of the statistical mechanics and the classical fluctuation theory , they are not the only physically admissible : an open system could be arbitrarily affected by many other external conditions so that the whole experimental setup ( the interest system + its surrounding ) do not correspond necessarily to a closed environment .",
    "it is important to mention that although an open system should exhibit a stationary macroscopic state when the external conditions are also stationary , most of these stationary states do not correspond to _ equilibrium conditions _ since the probability currents between microstates may not vanish .",
    "let us consider certain experimental setup which allows the interest short - range hamiltonian system @xmath107 to interchange energy with its surroundings in some stationary way that leads this system to a thermodynamic equilibrium described by the following _ generalized canonical ensemble_:@xmath108 where @xmath109 corresponds to certain reparametrization of the total energy @xmath110 preserving the extensive character of the energy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "obviously , the generic form of the distribution function [ g.canonical ] contains the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] as a particular case , where the only explicit difference is the introduction of the energy reparametrization @xmath111 .",
    "the generalized distribution function [ g.canonical ] can be straightforward derived from the maximization of the shannon - boltzmann - gibbs extensive entropy [ sbg ] by preserving the average value of the microscopic observable @xmath104:@xmath112 this observation allows us to understand that the role of the experimental setup which leads to the generalized canonical ensemble [ g.canonical ] is just to preserve the average [ average ] instead the energy average:@xmath113 obviously , the present experimental setup is a more sophisticate version of the thermostat of the gibbs canonical ensemble which keeps fixed the `` canonical '' parameter @xmath114 instead the inverse temperature @xmath74",
    ". we shall refer this external setup as a _ generalized thermostat _ whose canonical parameter @xmath114 exhibits in the present framework the same thermodynamic relevance of the ordinary temperature in the conventional thermodynamics .",

    "this affirmation follows directly from the reparametrization invariance of the microcanonical ensemble:@xmath115 which allows us to express the partition function of the generalized canonical ensemble ( [ g.canonical ] ) by using the following laplace transformation : @xmath116 the analogy between the equations [ lap2 ] and [ lap1 ] allows us to understand that the generalized canonical ensemble admits a simple extension of the features of the gibbs canonical ensemble by using the reparametrization @xmath104 instead the total energy @xmath50 of the extensive system .",

    "global ensemble equivalence _ when these ensembles are locally equivalent everywhere .",
    "two macroscopic states corresponding to different generalized canonical descriptions ( with reparametrizations @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively ) are _ mutually equivalent _ when these macroscopic states are locally equivalent to the same macroscopic state in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it is very easy to derive from the stationary conditions [ station2 ] that the canonical parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 of mutually equivalent macroscopic states are related by the following transformation rule:@xmath127 this is exactly the transformation rule during the reparametrization changes of unidimensional covariant vectors expressed in the equation [ covariant_vector ] .",
    "while a microcanonical state remains invariable under the reparametrization changes , this kind of transformations provokes the transition among macroscopic states associated to different generalized canonical ensembles [ g.canonical ] which could non necessarily be mutually equivalent among them .",
    "the transformation rule [ transf_2 ] allows us a better understanding about the nature of the generalized thermostat associated to a generalized canonical ensemble by compared this last one with an ordinary thermostat during their interaction with a very large system . during a reparametrization change from a generalized canonical ensemble with reparametrization @xmath128 towards the gibbs canonical ensemble the respective canonical parameters @xmath114 and @xmath74",

    "the critical slowing down observed in the neighborhood of the critical point of the second - order phase transitions is intimately related with the existence of the long - range order ( divergence of correlation length ) which characterizes the microscopic picture of this kind of phase transitions .",

    "particularly , the missing of the lost of analyticity of the entropy allows us to think that the above anomaly can not be associated to the occurrence of an ergodicity breaking .",
    "for example , the analytical character of the entropy per particle in the thermodynamic limit of the above hypothetical system allows us to approximate the caloric curve @xmath208 in the neighborhood of the critical point @xmath300 by the taylor power series : @xmath315 where @xmath316 and @xmath317 a positive integer , expression leading to a power law divergent behavior of the heat capacity [ power ] with critical exponent @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "consequently , this result corresponds to a critical phenomenon with universal ratio @xmath320 and critical exponent @xmath305 related to a odd number @xmath321 .",
    "the above result allows to claim that the existence of divergent power laws with nontrivial critical exponents @xmath305  and universal ratio @xmath322 in most of real physical systems exhibiting a continuous phase transition associated to the occurrence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking is a clear indicator of the lost of analyticity of the entropy per particle in the thermodynamic limit in such cases .",
    "an anomaly like the one exhibited by our hypothetical system can be seen as an asymptotic case of a discontinuous phase transition , which shall be referred in this work as a _ 1st - kind continuous phase transition_.    the discontinuous character of the first derivatives of the entropy per particle in the thermodynamic limit during the occurrence of the microcanonical discontinuous phase transitions can lead to discontinuity of some of the first derivatives of the planck potential ( or other thermodynamic potential characterizing an open system ) or even provoke the discontinuity of the thermodynamical potential itself . this last mathematical anomaly is unusual for the systems dealt within the conventional thermodynamics , but it can be observed in the astrophysical context and others long - range interacting systems .",
    "the interested reader can find in the ref.@xcite an example of a discontinuity of the caloric curve @xmath208 observed in the thermodynamical description of astrophysical model , indicating the existence of metastable states at the same total energy with different temperature ( mathematical anomaly leading to a discontinuity of the planck potential @xmath91 ) .",
    "while the thermodynamical behavior associated to the discontinuity of the planck thermodynamic potential could be referred as a _ zero - order phase transition _ within the well - known ehrenfest classification , the discontinuity of some of its first derivatives is just a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "although we can not provide in this work a  rigorous demonstration about the relationship between the lost of analyticity of the entropy per particle in the thermodynamic limit with the occurrence of ergodicity breaking in the microscopic dynamics , we have considered in this work some examples suggesting that such connection exists .",
    "loosely speaking , the ergodicity breaking takes place as a consequence of the dynamical competition among metastable states , where the predominance of any of them depends crucially on the initial conditions of the microscopic dynamics and the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "particularly , the thermodynamical study of the @xmath190 states potts model presented in the section [ potts ] suggests that the microcanonical continuous phase transition observed in this model system is provoked by the competition among metastable states which essentially identical ( states with the same magnetization density ) since they are related by a symmetry transformation ( @xmath269 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the microcanonical discontinuous phase transition observed in this model system is also provoked by the competition among metastable states , which are essentially different ( states with different spontaneous magnetization density ) since them can not be related by a symmetry transformation .",
    "the reader may notice that the discontinuity of the first derivative of the entropy described in the ref.@xcite ( a microcanonical discontinuous phase transition ) can be associated to the occurrence of ergodicity breaking originated from the competition among metastable states with different temperature .",
    "as already shown in this work , the existence and the features of anomalies observed in the thermodynamical description of given hamiltonian system depends crucially on the external conditions which have been imposed .",
    "it means that a phase transition is not only an intrinsic thermodynamical anomaly of a given system , but also a specific response to the nature of the external control of its thermodynamic equilibrium . generally speaking ,",
    "the mathematical description of the phase transitions for systems in thermodynamic limit starts from the consideration of the lost of analyticity of the thermodynamic potential which is relevant in a given application .",
    "the most simple characterization of the thermodynamical anomalies of a given hamiltonian system is obtained within the microcanonical description , which is relevant when the interest system is isolated .",
    "phase transitions here can be recognized by the lost of analyticity of the entropy  @xmath288 in the thermodynamic limit , a mathematical anomaly ( type * b.i * or * b.ii * ) which is reparametrization invariant and should be originated from the occurrence of the ergodicity breaking phenomenon .",

    "such ambiguity leads necessarily to a reconsideration of any classification scheme of the phase transitions based on the concavity of the microcanonical entropy @xcite .",

    "particularly , we have shown that the well - known ensemble inequivalence of the gibbs canonical ensemble [ gibbs ] can be avoided within an appropriate generalized canonical ensemble [ g.canonical ] , which describes an open system put in contact with a generalized version of the gibbs thermostat ( heat bath ) whose inverse temperature @xmath74 exhibits _ correlated fluctuations _ with the fluctuations of the total energy @xmath50 of the interest system ( see in subsection [ gen.can.ens ] ) .",

    "the analysis of such questions demands a further study .",
    "particularly , we have only consider in the present work a generalization of the gibbs canonical ensemble , while it is reasonable a generalization of any boltzmann - gibbs distributions .",
    "the possibility of avoid the ensemble inequivalence by using the generalized canonical ensemble [ g.canonical ] allows us to improve some monte carlo methods based on the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "this aim was carried out in the subsection [ gmmc ] and the ref.@xcite as a example of application of the present reparametrization invariance ideas for the implementation of a generalized version of the well - known metropolis importance sample algorithm @xcite .",
    "the most important conclusion obtained from our subsequent analysis is the recognition about the fundamental role of the arbitrary external conditions ( the using of different experimental setups ) which can be imposed to the interest system in order to control its thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "particularly , the existence and nature of the phase transitions ( admitting them as a sudden change of the thermodynamic behavior of a given system while a smooth change of a _ control parameter _ ) depends crucially on the nature of the external experimental setup . this fact was shown in the section [ potts ] by considering the microcanonical description of the @xmath190 states potts model system , where the gibbs canonical description predicts the occurrence of a first - order phase transition and the microcanonical description exhibits two microcanonical phase transitions which are hidden by the ensemble inequivalence .    while there are only two thermodynamical anomalies which can be classified as phase transitions within the microcanonical ensemble ( presumably associated to the occurrence of ergodicity breaking phenomenon @xcite ) , there are five of them in an open system ( `` within a generalized canonical description '' ) : two of them closely related with the ensemble inequivalence ( 1st - kind discontinuous pt and  its limiting case , the 1st - kind continuous pt ) and the other three with the lost of analyticity of the entropy @xmath288 in the thermodynamic limit ( zero - order pt , 2st - kind discontinuous pt and the 2st - kind continuous pt ) . to our viewpoint",
