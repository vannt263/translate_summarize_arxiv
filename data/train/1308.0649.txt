    "in this work , we apply the relativistic linearized coupled - cluster single - double ( sd ) approximation to calculate positron binding energies for the atoms in the whole periodic table . calculating the positron - atom bound states",
    "is a challenging theoretical problem due to the strong electron - positron correlation effects and virtual positronium ( ps ) formation  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such states was predicted by many - body calculation  @xcite and verified variationally  @xcite more than a decade ago . since that time",
    "a number of theoretical papers were published but only few atomic systems were studied .",
    "the most accurate calculations were performed for eleven positron - atom systems involving li , na , ag , cu , au , be , mg , ca , zn , sr and cd atoms  @xcite .",
    "recent empirical fitted expression involving the polarizabilities ( @xmath0 ) , ionization potentials ( @xmath1 ) , and numbers of valence @xmath2 electrons has also been based on the best calculations mentioned above @xcite .",
    "a number of positron - atom bound states involving atoms with open @xmath3 subshells were studied in our previous paper  @xcite . in spite of all these predictions",
    "no experimental evidence for positron - atom bound states has been found so far .    the situation is better for positron - molecule interaction since the resonant annihilation",
    "is observed for positrons in many polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "the incident positron is captured into the bound state with the target molecule , with the excess energy being transferred to vibrations .",
    "since the vibrational motion of the molecules is quantized , these transitions can only take place at specific positron energies .",
    "these energies correspond to vibrational feshbach resonances of the positron - molecule complex @xcite .",
    "the majority of the resonances observed are associated with individual vibrational modes of the molecule .",
    "the energy of the positron binding is then extracted from the downshift of the resonance energy , relative to the energy of the vibrational excitation @xcite .",
    "hence , by observing the resonances , the positron binding energy can be found . in this way",
    ", binding energies for over 60 polyatomic species have been determined @xcite by measuring positron annihilation using a high - resolution , tunable , trap - based positron beam @xcite .",
    "a similar effect in atoms has been proposed for experimental detection of positron - atom bindings in @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the resonances in the positron annihilation with atoms can be observed and associated with binding of positron to a low - energy electronic excitations .",
    "these resonances can be found in open - shell atoms .",
    "if such atoms can bind a positron in the ground state , then it is very likely that they can bind a positron in the excited state of the same configuration .",
    "one can then consider the following process , @xmath4 first , a positron loses some energy by exciting the atom and becomes trapped to a bound state with the excited atom .",
    "then , it annihilates with one of the electrons , and the resulting gamma quanta can be detected .",
    "the first step of the process ( [ eq : ae+ ] ) is obviously reversible .",
    "hence , to estimate the efficiency of the resonant annihilation one needs to evaluate the rates of both positron annihilation ( @xmath5 ) and autodetachment ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "one may estimate @xmath7 mev for a feshbach resonance at @xmath8 ev , populated through a quadrupole transition  @xcite .",
    "hence , the resonances are sufficiently narrow to produce observable sharp features in the energy dependence of the annihilation rate @xmath9 . for a binding energy @xmath10 mev ,",
    "the estimated annihilation width is @xmath11 ev and the branching ratio @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the total width of the resonance ) . for a positron beam with the energy",
    "spread @xmath14 mev , the peak resonant value of the annihilation rate is given by @xmath15 in ref .",
    "this indicates that the positron - atom resonances could be observed with a trap - based - beam - technique similar to what was used for measuring resonances in the positron - molecule annihilation @xcite .",
    "resonances also manifest themselves in the positron scattering .",
    "another method - measurement of the positron binding energies through laser assisted photorecombination - was suggested in @xcite .",
    "we also would like to mention a possibility to capture positron to a shallow bound level using a pulse of a very strong magnetic field .",
    "such field of the strength up to 100 tesla is available , for example , in the los alamos laboratory . indeed , energy of an upper zeeman component of the shallow positron - atom bound state may come above the ionization threshold and cross with the level of free positron resulting in the positron capture ( the same mechanism may be used to capture electron to a negative ion state ) .",
    "this possibility deserves a separate publication , and we do not proceed any further in the present paper .    these possibilities to create the positron - atom bound states motivate us to survey the whole periodic table for positron binding and tabulate the results for experimentalists .",
    "in present paper we extend the study started in our previous paper  @xcite to all atoms in the periodic table up to uranium .",
    "almost all previous calculations considered positron interacting with either a closed - subshell atom or an atom with a single electron above a closed - subshell core .",
    "the only exceptions are our recent works  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is simple , there is no adequate theoretical method to perform accurate calculations for positron binding to open - shell atoms . in our previous paper@xcite",
    "we suggested to use the linearized coupled - cluster single - double ( sd ) approach for this purpose . in this approach the interparticle interaction is included to all orders via an iterative procedure .",
    "the corresponding subset of terms includes the so - called _ ladder _ diagrams .",
    "this class of diagrams is very important in the positron - atom problem since it describes the effect of a virtual ps formation .",
    "summation of the electron - positron ladder - diagram series was performed earlier by solving a linear matrix equation for the electron - positron vertex function for hydrogen @xcite , noble - gas atoms  @xcite , and halogen negative ions  @xcite .",
    "the linearized coupled - cluster method in its single - double approximation has been applied for a number of very accurate calculations for atoms and ions with one external electron above closed shells ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is expected that the modified sd equations for the case of a positron interacting with a closed - shell atom should also give a reliable and accurate result .",
    "a very brief summary of the sd equations for positron - atom interaction is provided in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the details of the theory are given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "comparison of our results for closed shell atoms with the available most accurate calculations is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : closed ] .",
    "this provides us with an estimate of our accuracy . how the method is applied to the open - shell atoms",
    "is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : open ] where we also present positron binding energies to the ground state configuration of every atom in the periodic table .",
    "determination of the energies of the resonances and excited bound states is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : excited ] .",
    "the calculations for the positron binding to the excited electronic configurations of atoms are also presented in the same section .",
    "the paper ends with section [ sec : conclusion ] where all our results are summarized .",
    "the recommended values of the positron binding energies are presented in table [ t:5 ] .",
    "the recommended values of the excited bound states and resonances are presented in tables [ t:6 ] , [ t:7 ] and [ t:10 ] .",
    "many - body atomic calculations for the positron - atom binding need construction of the single - particle basis sets separately for electron states and positron states .",
    "we use relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) method and the b - spline technique  @xcite to do this .",
    "the self - consistent rhf procedure is initially done for the atom without a positron",
    ". then full sets of single - electron and positron states are constructed using b - splines in a cavity of a reasonably large radius @xmath16 .",
    "the radius must be larger than the size of the atom and should be chosen in such a way that the total positron - atom system fits into the cavity .",
    "we use @xmath17 a.u .",
    "the effect of the finite cavity size on the positron - atom binding energy was studied and found to be negligible .",
    "the single - particle basis states are found by constructing them as linear combination of b - splines and diagonalizing the matrix of the rhf hamiltonian @xmath18 here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the dirac matrices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the direct and exchange rhf potentials respectively .",
    "the pair @xmath23 is taken @xmath24 for electron and @xmath25 for positron .",
    "the wave function of an atom with a positron in state @xmath26 can be written in the single - double ( sd ) approximation as an expansion @xmath27    @xmath28 is the zeroth - order wave function of the frozen - core atom in the relativistic hartree - fock approximation with the positron in state @xmath26 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the rhf wave function of the atomic core .",
    "note that the following notations have been used to label the basis state in the rest of the paper : indices @xmath31 refer to electron states in the core , indices @xmath32 refer to electron states above the core , indices @xmath33 refer to positron states , and indices @xmath34 refer to any states .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiv ] ) represent single- and double - electron excitations from the core .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 represent excitations of the positron , and the coefficients @xmath38 represent simultaneous excitations of the positron and one of the electrons .",
    "the sd equations for the core excitation coefficients ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) do not depend on the external particle and they are the same in the electron and positron cases .",
    "these are well known equations from the linearized coupled - cluster theory , the details of the theory can be found , for instance , in ref .",
    "the first step is to solve these equations iteratively to obtain the single - electron coefficients @xmath39 and the double - electron coefficients @xmath36 for the core and to fix them in the rest of the calculation .",
    "the convergence of the core equations is maintained by observing the correlation correction to the energy of the core .",
    "one can refer to our previous paper  @xcite for the explicit form of the core equations .",
    "after solving the sd equations for the core , one can start iterating the sd equations for the external particle .",
    "the sd equations for the positron can be obtained by substituting the state @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiv ] ) into the relativistic many - body schrdinger equation , @xmath41 projecting this equation onto @xmath42 gives the equation for @xmath43 , @xmath44 projecting eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) onto @xmath45 gives the equation for the double - excitation coefficient @xmath46 , @xmath47 in these equations @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the coulomb integrals for the electron - electron interaction and electron - positron interaction respectively .",
    "when solving these equations , the correction to the energy of the positron state @xmath26 , @xmath52 is used to control the convergence .",
    "in contrast to the electrons - only case the calculations do not stop here .",
    "when the sd equations are used to calculate the energy and the wave function of the atom with single - valence electron above closed shells the rhf approximation is already a good approximation for the valence electron and only small correction is needed .",
    "the correction is given by expressions similar to ( [ eq : v1],[eq : v2],[eq : dev ] ) ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in the positron case there is no good zeroth - order approximation for the wave function of the bound positron . in the rhf approximation",
    "the positron - atom interaction is repulsive , and all of the single - particle positron basis states lie in the continuum .",
    "since we can not use a single positron rhf state as initial approximation we have to use all of them as a basis .",
    "the wave function of the positron bound to an atom is presented as a linear combination of the positron rhf states @xmath53 the energy @xmath54 and the expansion coefficients @xmath55 are found by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vector of expansion coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath58 is the lowest eigenvalue ( which must be negative ) , and the elements of the effective hamiltonian matrix @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) represents the positron energies in the static rhf approximation .",
    "the second and third terms describe the effect of the electron - positron correlations",
    ". the sd equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) must be iterated for every state in the expansion ( [ eq : psip ] ) . since these equations depend on the energy @xmath54 which is found later from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sx ] ) , we start with an initial guess for @xmath54 .",
    "the calculations are then performed iteratively , solving the sd equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) and diagonalizing the matrix ( [ eq : sigma ] ) several times until @xmath58 has converged .",
    "the virtual ps formation is described by electron - positron ladder diagram series .",
    "they are included in sd equation in all orders .",
    "however , some third order diagrams are missed by sd method .",
    "it is well known that the missing third - order terms can give sizeable corrections to the energy in atomic systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . including these terms can lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of the results ( see the section [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "consequently , we include these contributions for the positron - bound states with atoms in this work .",
    "the list of the missing third - order diagrams in sd equations and the corresponding perturbation - theory corrections to the energy of the positron state are derived and listed in ref .",
    "in our previous paper  @xcite , we have reported the calculations of positron binding to 26 neutral atoms by using the current method .",
    "the rest of atoms in the periodic table is examined in this paper up to atomic number @xmath61 ( uranium ) .",
    "all raw data are presented in tables [ t:1 ] to [ t:4 ] .",
    "although there is no rigorous criterion for the positron binding to a neutral atom , it is widely accepted that the static dipole polarizability @xmath62 and ionization potential @xmath1 of the atom play an important role .",
    "indeed , positron feels strong attractive polarization potential @xmath63 outside the atom .",
    "therefore , large value of @xmath64 and small radius of the atomic core increase the binding",
    ". small radius of the atomic core corresponds to a large ionization potential @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be combined as a single parameter which we have called the strength of the polarization potential  @xcite .",

    "the arrangements of the first four tables are as follows .",
    "firstly , the atoms with similar valence shells are grouped and placed in the same table in increasing order of atomic number @xmath68 .",
    "a group with similar ground configurations is divided into two sub - groups according to condition @xmath69 ev . for atoms with @xmath70 ev",
    ", the ps - formation channel is closed .",
    "the closest decay channel will be e@xmath71a .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath72 ev the lowest channel is ps@xmath73a@xmath74 . in this work ,",
    "the positron binding energies have always been obtained with respect to the decay channel e@xmath71a while in many papers the binding energies have been reported relative to the closest decay channel .",

    "the best calculations in the literature are presented in last columns of tables [ t:1 ] and [ t:4 ] .",
    "there are eleven atoms studied accurately to predict the positron binding energies .",
    "the results for positron bound with closed - subshell atoms are shown in table [ t:1 ] .",
    "we use these atoms to test our method because these are the easiest systems from the computational point of view and a number of accurate calculations is available .",
    "the positron binding energies of @xmath78 mev , @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 mev , and @xmath81 mev for sr , ca , cd , and zn atoms relative to the lowest thresholds ( a@xmath71ps for sr and ca and e@xmath71a for cd and zn ) have been obtained by the ci@xmath82fc@xmath83 method in refs .",

    "a stochastic variational method ( svm ) was used for atoms with a small number of electrons .",
    "the positron binding energies of @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev were obtained for mg and be by the svmfc@xmath83 and svm methods in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most accurate value is probably for be atom because it is the simplest system ( four electrons in closed shells plus positron ) .",
    "our calculations give the binding energy of 214 mev which is 128 mev larger than the 86 mev energy obtained in @xcite . a somewhat similar binding energy access",
    "is observed when comparing our results with available accurate calculations for other systems , see table [ t:1 ] ( we will use this @xmath89 mev correction to improve our results for a number of atoms where other accurate calculations are not available - see below ) .",
    "note that the difference between our and the best earlier calculations for heavier atoms ( mg , ca , zn , sr , and cd ) could be slightly larger due to the relativistic effects which have not been taken into account in the works by mitroy group .",
    "in contrast , our calculations are relativistic .",
    "our final raw results for the binding energy ( @xmath90 ) is the sum of the solution of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : sx ] ) ( sd ) and the third order contributions ( e3 ) .",
    "the negative @xmath91 means that there is no positron binding to an atom .",
    "the positron - atom binding energy is very sensitive to the correlations .",
    "this leads to a large uncertainty in the calculations .",
    "therefore , some negative values of @xmath90 might be within theoretical error bars .",
    "as expected , increase of @xmath1 and decrease of @xmath0 lead to decrease of the positron - atom binding energy @xmath90 ( see table [ t:1 ] ) .",
    "the first subgroup has larger @xmath90 than the rest of the table .",
    "this is also expected since atoms in this subgroup have larger potential strength @xmath67 .",
    "tables [ t:2 ] , [ t:3 ] and [ t:4 ] show the positron binding energies to the ground state configurations of the open - shell atoms , which were suggested in our previous works  @xcite as good candidates for experimental detection of positron - atom bound states via resonant annihilation or scattering .    to deal with the positron binding to open - shell atoms with the sd approach we use an approximation in which open shells are treated as closed ones but with fractional occupation numbers  @xcite .",
    "for example , the ground - state electron configuration of neutral fe is @xmath92 above the ar - like core .",
    "we treat it as a closed - shell system but reduce the contribution of the @xmath93 subshell to the potential and ci matrix elements ( [ eq : sigma ] ) by the factor @xmath94 .",
    "both members of the fine - structure multiplet , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are included and corresponding terms are rescaled by the same factor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "note that the positron - atom binding has no strong sensitivity to the valence shell being open or closed because the pauli principle is not applicable to the positron - electron interaction .",
    "table [ t:2 ] shows the results of our calculations of positron binding energies @xmath90 for atoms with an open @xmath3-shell and an open @xmath97-shell .",
    "their common feature is that they have an @xmath2 orbital as the upper subshell in their ground configurations .",
    "our numerical calculations have shown that this upper @xmath2-shell provides dominating contribution to the positron binding . as a result",
    "the positron is bound relative to the threshold of the channel ( a+@xmath98 ) for all atoms .",
    "the situation is different for atoms in table [ t:3 ] where atoms with an open @xmath99-shell are presented . here only in",
    "and tl have positron binding on their ground state configuration relative to the channel ( a+@xmath98 ) .",
    "however , in and tl are still unstable against ps - formation , see table [ t:5 ] .",
    "all other atoms in table [ t:3 ] have no bound states with positron . these results are also consistent with the magnitude of the strength parameter @xmath67 which is @xmath100 in table [ t:2 ] and @xmath101 in table [ t:3 ] .",
    "atoms in table [ t:4 ] are different from the rest of the periodic table .",
    "first of all , they have very simple electronic configurations , one @xmath2 electron above closed subshells , so they are the second simplest systems from the computational point of view after the closed shell atoms in table [ t:1 ] .",
    "two particles ( an electron plus a positron ) above closed shells can be treated using a sophisticated atomic many - body theory .",
    "some best calculations are presented in the last column of the table . on the other hand ,",
    "the ps formation channel is open for alkali metals ( the first set of atoms in table [ t:4 ] ) since @xmath72 ev for them .",
    "therefore , these systems are better described as positronium orbiting the positive ion a@xmath74 @xcite ( a molecular type of bonding ) .",
    "such systems are hard to describe in our present approach where a single - center basis with the origin on the atomic nucleus is used . to achieve a convergence ,",
    "a very large number of partial waves @xmath102 must be included to describe the total wave function .",
    "the fact that we could not get any convergent values for the positron binding energies to rb , fr , and cs supports this argument .",
    "comparison of our result for li with the accurate variational calculation of mitroy @xcite shows that our method underestimates the positron binding energies for alkali atoms .",
    "however , we obtained good agreements with the previous accurate calculations for cu , ag , and au ( see table [ t:4 ] ) . therefore , accurate description for alkali atoms requires higher values of the maximum angular momentum @xmath102 .",
    "the value @xmath103 has been fixed in our computation for all atoms .",
    "hence it is reasonable to estimate the extrapolated positron binding energies for alkalis in the limit of @xmath104 .",
    "this is done by using of the asymptotic formula @xmath105 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the perturbation theory . here",
    "@xmath106 is the binding energy for @xmath102 and @xmath107 is a constant which is different in different atoms .",
    "when the convergence is achieved for a given @xmath102 , all @xmath108 must lie on a straight line with respect to @xmath109 .",
    "for instance , the figure [ f:1 ] shows that the positron binding energy for li has not been convergent yet at @xmath103 .",
    "however , we can estimate the extrapolated positron energy by assuming the straight line obtained from the last two points ( for @xmath110 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "we see that our extrapolated binding energies for li and na are still smaller than the previous accurate calculations shown in table [ t:4 ] .",
    "now we will try to improve our predictions of the positron binding energies for all atoms based on comparison of our calculations and available accurate calculations for be , li , and cu .",
    "be is the simplest closed - shell atom that can bind positron ( see table [ t:1 ] ) , li is the simplest alkaline atom that can bind positron , and cu has one electron above closed shell core ( see table [ t:4 ] ) .",
    "each of them belongs to a different type of group in the periodic table .",
    "we assume that atoms in the same group or in nearby similar group interact with positron in the same way .",
    "the previous presumably accurate calculations of the positron binding to these three atoms ( be , li , cu ) can be used to estimate the errors in the present calculations .",
    "our method overestimates the binding energy for be  @xcite , underestimates it for li  @xcite , and is in good agreement with previous calculation for cu @xcite . using these differences between our results and the most accurate results of other calculations ,",
    "we derive recommended values for the positron - atom binding energies for the whole periodic table in table [ t:5 ] .",
    "the recommended binding energies for the atoms with closed shells or open @xmath97 , @xmath3 or @xmath99 shells are obtained by subtracting @xmath89 mev from our results presented in tables [ t:1 ] , [ t:2 ] , and [ t:3 ] .",
    "this is done to eliminate the difference between our value of @xmath111 mev and the accurate result @xmath88 mev @xcite for be atom .",
    "the recommended positron binding energy to mg has been taken from ref .",
    "we use our previous accurate results for cu , ag , and au obtained by the relativistic ci+mbpt method  @xcite as recommended values for these systems ( @xmath112 ev , @xmath113 ev , @xmath114 ev respectively ) .",
    "the previous result for cu is very close to the current calculation ( @xmath115 ev ) anyway .",
    "the binding energies for rb , cs , and fr are estimated by the linear extrapolation of the values for li , na , and k with respect to the ion ( a@xmath74 ) radius which is inversely proportional to the ion ionization potential ( @xmath116 ) . in this estimation",
    "we have used the literature results for li and na and the corrected result @xmath117 mev for k atom ( our raw number is @xmath118 mev is assumed to be underestimated similar to li and na ) . note that all positron binding energies for li , na , and k lies on a straight line with respect to @xmath119 . using values of @xmath119 for the rb@xmath74 , cs@xmath74 , and fr@xmath74 ions",
    "we obtain the extrapolated positron binding energies for them by putting them on the same line ( a linear extrapolation ) .",
    "we conclude that positron systems with k , rb , cs , and fr atoms are unstable due to decay to positronium and positive ion ( see table [ t:5 ] ) .",
    "we also present in table [ t:5 ] the positron - atom binding energies relative to the ps - formation threshold , a@xmath71ps .",
    "the closest decay channel is emphasized by the bold number in the table [ t:5 ] .",
    "we also present the results of the table [ t:5 ] in the graphical form on fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] .",
    "therefore , more than a half of atoms in the periodic table may bind positron .      in our calculations we do not distinguish between different electron states of the same configuration .",
    "if positron is bound to an atom in particular configuration , it is bound to all states of this configuration with approximately the same binding energy .",
    "therefore , the energy splitting inside the ground state configuration is assumed to be the same for atoms with or without a positron .",
    "this assumption is supported by similar features of atomic scalar polarizabilities .",
    "the scalar polarizabilities have very close values for the different states of the same ground - state configuration of many - electron atoms  @xcite .",
    "the values of the scalar polarizabilities determine the strength of the attractive polarization potential @xmath63 acting on positron .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that if the polarizabilities are equal the positron binding energies will also be equal .",
    "since the energy splitting within a configuration is assumed to be the same for the atom with or without a positron , the energies of the excited states of the positron - atom system can be obtained as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the experimental value of the atomic excitation energy relative to the ground state and @xmath76 is the positron binding energy to the ground state .",
    "these excited states are also bound as long as @xmath122 .",
    "positive values of @xmath123 correspond to resonances in continuum . to close the positronium formation channel we also need the condition @xmath124 where @xmath1 is the atomic ionization potential and",

    "table [ t:6 ] shows resonances and bound states for the atoms with ionization potential larger than @xmath128 ev while table [ t:7 ] is for atoms with @xmath129 ev .",
    "due to the limited accuracy of our calculations ( @xmath130 mev ) the weakly bound positron states shown in table [ t:6 ] may turn out to be low - lying resonances and vice versa .",
