    "cold , dilute fermi gases in which the interaction between the atoms can be tuned using an external magnetic field provide a new paradigm for strongly correlated quantum fluids @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been significant interest in the transport properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "this interest was triggered by three independent developments .",
    "the first was the experimental observation of almost ideal hydrodynamic flow in the normal phase of a cold fermi gas in the limit of infinite scattering length @xcite .",
    "the second was the discovery of almost ideal flow in a completely different system , the quark gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . both of these experiments constrain the shear viscosity of the fluid .",
    "remarkably , while the absolute value of the shear viscosity of the two systems differs by about 26 orders of magnitude , the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath5 to entropy density @xmath6 is very similar , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is planck s constant and @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant @xcite .",
    "the third development was the theoretical discovery of a new method to compute the shear viscosity of strongly coupled field theories @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the holographic duality between four dimensional field theory and string theory in higher dimensional spaces @xcite . using the holographic equivalence",
    "one can show that in a large class of field theories the strong coupling limit of @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this value is remarkably close to the experimental results for @xmath10 quoted above .",
    "initially the value @xmath12 was derived only for scale invariant relativistic field theories , but it was later shown that the same value of @xmath10 is obtained in the strong coupling limit of many non - conformal and non - relativistic field theories @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will use kinetic theory to compute another important transport property of a dilute atomic fermi gas , the thermal conductivity @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider both the high temperature as well as the low temperature , superfluid , phase .",
    "our results complement earlier studies of the shear and bulk viscosity in the high and low temperature phase .",
    "the shear viscosity was studied in @xcite . in the unitarity limit",
    "the bulk viscosity of the high temperature phase vanishes @xcite . in the superfluid phase",
    "there are three bulk viscosities , one of which is non - vanishing in the unitarity limit .",
    "the bulk viscosities in the superfluid phase were recently computed in @xcite . combining our results for the thermal conductivity with the existing calculations of the shear viscosity we can study the relative size of momentum diffusion and thermal diffusion .",
    "the ratio of these quantities is known as the prandtl number @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the specific heat at constant pressure and @xmath15 is the fluid mass density .",
    "the prandtl number also controls the relative importance of shear viscosity and thermal conductivity in sound attenuation .",
    "measurements of sound attenuation have the potential to provide new experimental constraints on transport properties of dilute atomic gases .",
    "current estimates of the shear viscosity are based on the study of scaling flows , such as collective modes or the expansion out of a deformed trap @xcite .",
    "these experiments do not directly constrain the density independent part of the shear viscosity .",
    "this is a problem , because kinetic theory predicts that the shear viscosity at high temperature is only a function of temperature , and not of density .",
    "sound attenuation , on the other hand , is sensitive to this contribution . using our results for the prandtl number it is possible to use measurements of sound attenuation to constrain the shear viscosity .",
    "conversely , in the regime where shear viscosity is well constrained it is possible to extract thermal conductivity from sound attenuation .",
    "first sound was observed in @xcite , and ideas for detecting second sound are discussed in @xcite .",
