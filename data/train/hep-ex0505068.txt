    "the cleo - c physics program is focused on the study of charm decays in @xmath1 collisions in the cesr - c storage ring at energies near the @xmath2 and @xmath9 resonances and above @xmath10 threshold .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on approximately 60  pb@xmath11 of data collected at the @xmath2 , just above @xmath8 threshold .    for many electroweak quantities measured by the @xmath12 factories at slac and kek , in particular many that contribute to constraining the ckm unitarity triangle@xcite ,",
    "the precision is limited by theoretical uncertainties rather than experimental precision .",
    "one of the primary goals of these measurements is the calibration and validation of lattice qcd .",
    "lattice qcd will soon be able to predict many quantities such as the decay constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath5 and @xmath15 mesons with few percent uncertainties .",
    "measurement of @xmath13 will lead to a determination of @xmath16 , since lattice qcd can predict the ratio @xmath17 better than the absolute decay constants .",
    "it is critical , however , that the uncertainties of the lattice calculations be verified by experimental measurements .",
    "cleo - c measurements of absolute branching fractions and form factors for a full isospin set of semileptonic decays will provide a stringent test of form factor calculations and models .",
    "in addition to verification of lattice qcd , cleo - c will improve on the existing measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and measure absolute branching fractions for many important hadronic normalization modes which contribute significant uncertainties to important measurements at higher energies .",
    "the decay constant @xmath13 is an important parameter which quantifies the annihilation probability of the valence quarks of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "this parameter can be determined from the absolute branching fraction @xmath20 . a first measurement of the absolute branching fraction of the decay @xmath21 was recently made by cleo - c .",
    "the analysis relies on fully reconstructing or `` tagging '' one @xmath5 or @xmath22 meson in the @xmath8 pair produced in the @xmath2 decay .",
    "this technique works quite well at the @xmath2 resonance , since there is not enough energy in the event to produce hadrons other than the @xmath8 pair . using the decay modes @xmath23 for the tag side @xmath5 ,",
    "an efficiency of approximately 25% for the tag reconstruction is achieved .",
    "a very pure sample of @xmath24 tagged @xmath5 mesons is selected .",
    "the tag @xmath5 meson is combined with an additional charged track of the correct sign , presumed to be a muon .",
    "the distribution of `` missing mass squared '' , defined to be @xmath25 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : missmass ]",
    ". a significant and well - defined peak of eight events at the neutrino mass around zero is observed .",
    "the peak at 0.25  gev@xmath26 corresponds to a background from decays to the @xmath27 final state , which is well separated from the signal region .",
    "the total contribution of backgrounds in the signal region is estimated in a maximum likelihood fit to be one event .",
    "this leads to a branching fraction of @xmath28 and a @xmath5 meson decay constant of @xmath29  mev , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic@xcite .",
    "the analysis of exclusive semileptonic decays also uses a tag of the other @xmath5 meson in the event .",
    "these tag @xmath5 mesons are selected using the beam - constrained mass of the candidate , defined as @xmath30 and the energy difference between the beam and the candidate , defined to be @xmath31 the remaining observable tracks are then reconstructed to form the daughter meson .",
    "the missing energy , @xmath32 , and missing momentum , @xmath33 , in the event are used to form the kinematic variable @xmath34 , which is fit to determine the signal and background contributions .",
    "these distributions and fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0exsemi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dplusexsemi ] for the neutral and charged @xmath5 meson modes , respectively .",
    "these raw numbers of events are corrected for efficiency and divided by the number of tag @xmath5 mesons to produce absolute branching fractions .",
    "the efficiencies are determined using a combination of geant monte carlo and data .",
    "these measurements include first observations of the modes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the absolute branching fraction measurements for these modes are summarized in table  [ tab : semi ] .",
    "even with only a small fraction of the final sample , the sensitivity is already an improvement over previous measurements@xcite for most modes .    0.1 in    .",

    "cleo - c is producing results that will have a large impact on electroweak physics .",
