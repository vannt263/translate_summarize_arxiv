    "the transport follows a master equation .",
    "the transfer rates between the participating centers can be related to the spatial arrangement of the centers .",
    "the arrangement is captured by the so - called laplacian matrix @xmath0 which we will identify here with the transfer matrix of the ctrw .",
    "however , when dealing with quantum particles at low densities and low temperatures , decoherence can be suppressed to a large extent : the study of transport in this regime requires different modeling tools , able to mimic the coherent features .",

    "indeed , this realizes a quantum mechanical analog of the ctrws defined on a discrete structure , i.e. the so - called continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) . however , apart from formal analogies , coherence can give rise to very peculiar properties ( e.g. anderson localization [ anderson , 1958 ] , crucial dependences of the transport on the starting position [ mlken _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ] and a quadratic speed - up of the chemical distance covered [ agliari _ et al .",

    "these effects allow interesting and cross - disciplinary applications and can also be exploited in experiments in order to distinguish whether the transport is rather classical or rather quantum mechanical [ mlken _ et al . _ , 2007 ] .",
    "in particular , a common means for probing the transport relies on the interaction with other species , such as impurity atoms or molecules ( found in or doped into the medium ) which irreversibly trap the charges or quench the excitations .",
    "consequently , a great deal of recent theoretical work has focused on investigating essential features of basic trapping models , wherein a single particle moves in a medium containing different arrangements of traps .",
    "indeed , much is known about the decay when the motion is incoherent [ van kampen , 1981 ; blumen _ et al .",
    "_ , 1983 ; 1986 ; ben - avraham & havlin , 2000 ] , while ( as we will show here ) when quantum effects become important , strong deviations from the classical results occur .",
    "in a set of early works the dynamics of coherent excitations on a chain with randomly distributed traps has been investigated using several methods [ hemenger _",
    "et al_. , 1974 ; kenkre , 1978 ; huber , 1980 ; parris , 1991 ] which provided a reasonably description of the process at short times and in the asymptotic limit . on the other hand , from the experimental point of view , the most relevant regime is the one of intermediate times ; in this time interval some striking effects have been recently highlighted [ mlken _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; mlken _ et al .",

    "here we focus on trapping processes taking place on a finite ring where the traps are distributed according to different arrangements : the traps are either gathered in a cluster or distributed periodically or randomly . in these cases the classical survival probability",
    "@xmath2 has been studied intensively ( see e.g. [ ben - avraham & havlin 2000 ] ) .",
    "in fact , under ordered conditions @xmath2 is known to exponentially decay to zero .",
    "conversely , for a random distribution of traps @xmath2 exhibits different time regimes : at long times it follows a stretched exponential which turns into a pure exponential when finite size effects dominate . as for the ctqw",
    ", the emergence of intrinsic quantum - mechanical effects , such as tunneling , prevents the decomposition of the problem into a collection of disconnected intervals and , as we will see , the mean survival probability @xmath3 is strongly affected by the trap arrangement .",
    "hence , by following the temporal decay of @xmath3 we can extract information about the geometry .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the cases analyzed here @xmath2 and @xmath3 exhibit qualitatively different behaviours ; this allows to determine the nature , either rather coherent or rather incoherent , of the transport process .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ctrw ] we provide a brief summary of the main concepts and of the formulae concerning ctqws . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trapping ] we introduce a mathematical formalism useful for analyzing trapping in the ctqw picture . in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbative ] , we consider special arrangements of traps on a ring and we investigate the mean survival probability by means of a perturbative approach ; these analytical findings are corroborated by numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : random ] we study the case of random distributions of traps and finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we present our comments and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath4 made up of @xmath5 nodes and algebraically described by the so - called adjacency matrix @xmath6:the non - diagonal elements @xmath7 equal @xmath8 if nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected by a bond and @xmath11 otherwise ; the diagonal elements @xmath12 are @xmath11 . from the adjacency matrix",
    "we can directly derive some interesting quantities concerning the corresponding graph .",
    "for instance the coordination number of a node @xmath9 is @xmath13 and the number of walks of length @xmath14 from @xmath9 to @xmath10 is given by @xmath15 [ biggs , 1974 ] .",
    "we also define the laplacian operator @xmath0 according to @xmath16 ; the set of all @xmath5 eigenvalues of @xmath17 is called the laplacian spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the laplacian spectrum is intimately related not only to dynamical processes involving particles moving on the graph , but also to dynamical processes involving the network itself ; these include energy transfer and diffusion - reaction processes as well as the relaxation of polymer networks , just to name a few ( see for example [ mohar , 1991 ; galiceanu & blumen , 2007 ] and references therein ) .    in the context of coherent and incoherent transport it is worth underlining that , being symmetric and non - negative definite , @xmath0 can generate both a probability conserving markov process and a unitary process [ childs & goldstone , 2004 ; mlken & blumen , 2005 ; volta _ et al .",
    ".    now , continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) [ montroll & weiss , 1965 ] are described by the following master equation : @xmath18 being @xmath19 the conditional probability that the walker is on node @xmath20 when it started from node @xmath10 at time @xmath11 . if the walk is unbiased the transmission rates @xmath21 are bond - independent and the transfer matrix @xmath22 is related to the laplacian operator through @xmath23 ( in the following we set @xmath24 ) .",
    "we now define the quantum - mechanical analog of the ctrw , i.e. the ctqw , by identifying the hamiltonian of the system with the classical transfer matrix , @xmath25 [ farhi & gutmann , 1998 ; mlken & blumen , 2005 ] .",
    "hence , given the orthonormal basis set @xmath26 , representing the walker localized at the node @xmath10 , we can write @xmath27 where in the second sum @xmath20 runs over all nearest neighbors ( nn ) of @xmath10 .",
    "the operator in eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] is also known as tight - binding hamiltonian . actually , the choice of the hamiltonian @xmath28 is , in general , not unique [ childs & goldstone , 2004 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] has two important advantages : it allows to take into account the local properties of the arbitrary substrate and , remarkably , it yields a mathematical formulation displaying important analogies with the classical picture .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the ctqw can be described by the transition amplitude @xmath29 from state @xmath30 to state @xmath31 , which obeys the following schrdinger equation : @xmath32 structurally very similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : master_cl ] .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : schrodinger ] can be formally written as @xmath33 whose squared magnitude provides the quantum mechanical transition probability @xmath34 .    in general",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the orthonormal basis @xmath35 $ ] which diagonalizes @xmath28 ; the correspondent set of eigenvalues is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath37    it should be underlined that while both problems ( ctrw and ctqw ) are linear , and thus many results obtained in solving ctrws ( eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) can be readily reutilized for ctqws , the physically relevant properties of the two cases differ vastly : thus , in the absence of traps ctqws are symmetric under time - inversion , which precludes them from attaining equipartition for the @xmath38 ( such as the @xmath19 for ctrws ) at long times .",
    "also , the quantal system keeps memory of the initial conditions , exemplified by the occurrence of quasi - revivals [ mlken & blumen , 2005 ; mlken & blumen , 2006 ] .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the operators describing the dynamics of ctqws and of ctrws share the same set of eigenvalues and of eigenstates . however , when new contributions ( arising e.g. from the interaction with external fields or absorbing sites ) are incorporated , the eigenvalues and the eigestates start to differ . in the following",
    "we introduce a formalism useful to analyze the dynamics of ctqws and ctrws in the presence of traps ; for this we will denote with @xmath39 and @xmath40 the unperturbed operators without traps .",
    "let us consider a system where @xmath41 out of the @xmath5 nodes are traps ; we label the trap positions with @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , and we denote this set with @xmath44 .    for substitutional traps",
    "the system can be described by the following effective ( but non - hermitian ) hamiltonian [ mlken _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the trapping operator defined as @xmath47 the capture strength @xmath48 determines the rate of decay for a particle located at trap site @xmath42 ; here we will take the @xmath48 to be equal for all traps , i.e. @xmath49 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the limit @xmath50 corresponds to perfect traps , which means that a classical particle is immediately absorbed when reaching any trap .    due to the non - hermiticity of @xmath28 , its eigenvalues",
    "are complex and can be written as @xmath51 ; moreover , the set of its left and right eigenvectors , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , can be chosen to be biorthonormal ( @xmath54 ) and to satisfy the completeness relation @xmath55 . therefore , according to eq .",

    "now , in the incoherent , classical transport case trapping is incorporated into the ctrw according to @xmath63 the transfer operator @xmath22 is therefore real and symmetric , and it leads to real , strictly negative eigenvalues which we denote by @xmath64 ; to them correspond the eigenstates @xmath65 .",
    "analogously , the mean survival probability for the ctrw can be written as @xmath66 from eq .",
    "[ eq : p ] one may deduce that @xmath2 attains in general rather quickly an exponential form ; furthermore , if the smallest eigenvalue @xmath67 is well separated from the next closest eigenvalue , @xmath2 is dominated by @xmath67 and by the corresponding eigenstate @xmath68 [ mlken _ et al . _ , 2007 ; mlken _ et al . _ ,",
    "2008 ] : @xmath69    lower estimates of the gap @xmath70 between the two smallest eigenvalues have been found in the past for special choices of operators ( see e.g. [ chen m. , 1997 ] and references therein ) . for instance , the operator @xmath71 has @xmath72 ; its next smallest eigenvalue represents the algebraic connectivity of the graph , namely the relative number of edges needed to be deleted to generate a bipartition . in the case of a @xmath20-regular graph @xmath70",

    "now , the @xmath147 decay differs qualitatively from that of the @xmath3 analyzed in the previous section . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rand ] , for intermediate times the average survival probability displays a power law , which decays more slowly than exponentially : @xmath149 a similar result has already been obtained for ctqws on a finite chain with two traps at its ends ( @xmath150 ) , in the presence of either nearest - neighbour [ mlken _ et al .",

    "[ fig : rand ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have modeled the coherent dynamics by continuous - time quantum walks and studied interactions with traps : taking a periodic chain as substrate , we calculated the mean quantal survival probability @xmath3 and we compared it to the classical @xmath2 for different trap arrangements . the quantum problem was approached both analytically ( by means of perturbative theory ) and numerically , showing that the spatial distribution of the traps significantly affects @xmath3 . in particular , when the traps are arranged periodically throughout the substrate , @xmath3 decays asymptotically to a nonvanishing value which depends directly on the system size @xmath5 and on the number of traps @xmath41 ( e.g. , when @xmath118 , @xmath153 for @xmath122 ) .",
    "this is a genuine quantum - mechanical effect with no counterpart in classical mechanics , where @xmath2 decays to zero for finite systems .",
    "another interesting , deterministic trap configuration is realized by distributing the traps consecutively such to form a cluster ; then at intermediate and long times the survival probability decays exponentially with the characteristic time @xmath154 .",
    "now , for the same trap configuration , the characteristic time for the classical survival probability doubles , being @xmath155 .    when the traps are distributed randomly on the substrate , a further , qualitatively different behaviour of @xmath3 is obtained .",
    "in fact , by averaging over different independent configurations we find in this case that at intermediate times @xmath147 decays algebraically , i.e. @xmath156 , where @xmath152 depends on @xmath41 and @xmath5 and is related to the imaginary part of the hamiltonian spectrum . on the other hand , for systems of relatively small size we find that in the same time range finite - size effects dominate @xmath148 , giving rise to an exponential decay .",
    "these results establish that studying the decay due to trapping is indeed an advantageous means to monitor the system s evolution , as it allows to determine the nature of the transport , which can be either rather coherent or rather incoherent .",
    "moreover , the behaviour exhibited by @xmath3 , being qualitatively affected by the trap configurations , may be used to distinguish between these .",
