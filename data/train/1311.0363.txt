    "+ let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-theory . the _ range property _ for @xmath1 states that if @xmath3 is a closed @xmath2-term , then its range ( considering @xmath3 as a map from @xmath4 to @xmath4 where @xmath4 is the algebra of closed @xmath2-terms modulo the equality defined by @xmath1 ) has cardinality either 1 or @xmath5 .",
    "it has been proved by barendregt in @xcite that the range property holds for all recursively enumerable theories .",
    "for the theory @xmath0 equating all unsolvable terms , the validity of the range property has been an open problem for a long time .",
    "very recently a. polonsky has shown ( see @xcite ) that it fails .    in an old attempt to prove the range property for @xmath0 , barendregt ( see @xcite )",
    "suggested a possible way to get the result .",
    "the idea was , roughly , as follows .",
    "first observe that , if the range of a term is not a singleton , it will reduce to a term of the form @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "assuming that , for some @xmath7 , @xmath8 \\neq_{\\mathcal{h } } f[x:=\\o]$ ] , he proposed another term @xmath9 ( the term @xmath10 of conjecture 3.2 in @xcite ) having a free variable @xmath11 that could never be erased or used in a reduction of @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "he claimed that , by the properties of the variable @xmath11 , the terms @xmath13 $ ] should be different where @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 is , for example , the church numeral for @xmath16 .",
    "it has been rather quickly understood by various researchers that the term proposed in @xcite actually _ had not _ the desired property and , of course , polonsky s result shows this method could not work .",
    "moreover , even if the term @xmath9 had the desired property it is , actually , not true that the terms @xmath13 $ ] would be different : see section [ bp ] below .",
    "+ even though the failure of the range property for @xmath0 is now known , we believe that having conditions which imply that the range of a term is infinite is , `` by itself '' interesting .",
    "we also think that the idea proposed by barendregt remains interesting and , in this paper , we consider the following problem .",
    "say that @xmath17 has the _ barendregt s persistence property _",
    "if for each @xmath7 such that @xmath8 \\neq_{\\mathcal{h } } f[x:=\\o]$ ] we can find a term @xmath9 that has a free variable @xmath11 that could never be erased or applied in a reduction of @xmath12 $ ] ( see definition [ applied ] ) .",
    "we give here some conditions on terms that imply the barendregt s persistence property .",
    "our main result is theorem [ cases ] .",
    "it can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath17 be a term having a unique free variable @xmath18 and @xmath7 be a closed term such that @xmath8 \\neq_{\\mathcal{h } } f[x:=\\o]$ ] .",
    "we introduce a sequence @xmath19 of reducts of @xmath17 that can simulate ( see lemma [ fk ] ) all the reductions of @xmath17 . by considering , for each @xmath20 , the different occurrences of @xmath18 in @xmath21 we introduce a tree @xmath22 and a special branch in it ( see theorem [ tree ] ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath23 the corresponding occurrence of @xmath18 in @xmath21 , theorem [ cases ] states that :    1 .   if , for @xmath24 , the number of arguments of @xmath23 in @xmath21 is bounded , @xmath17 has the barendregt s persistence property .",
    "2 .   otherwise and assuming the branch in @xmath25 is recursive there are two cases . 1 .   if some of the arguments of @xmath23 in @xmath21 come in head position infinitely often during the head reduction of @xmath8 $ ] , then @xmath17 has the barendregt s persistence property .",
    "2 .   otherwise , it is possible that @xmath17 does not have the barendregt s persistence property .    in case",
    "( 1 ) we give two arguments .",
    "the first one is quite easy and uses this very particular situation .",
    "it gives a term @xmath9 where @xmath11 can not be erased but we have not shown that it is never applied ( it is not applied only in the branch defined in section 2 ) . the second one ( which is more complicated ) is a complete proof that @xmath17 has the barendregt s persistence property . it can also be seen as an introduction to the more elaborate case 2.(a ) . for case 2.(b ) we give examples of terms @xmath17 for which there is no term having this property .",
    "+ [ bp ]    note that , actually , even if a term @xmath9 _ having _ the barendregt s persistence property can be found this would not give an infinite range for @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the property of @xmath9 does not imply that @xmath26 \\neq_{\\mathcal{h } } f[x = a_m]$ ] for @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 is the church integer for @xmath20 .",
    "this is an old result of plotkin ( see @xcite ) .",
