    "in the wavelength region of the vacuum ultraviolet , i.e. the range @xmath0 nm , most molecules exhibit an unstructured continuum spectrum , since the high energy photons probe the level structure above one or more dissociation limits . however , some important molecules exhibit a spectrum of narrow lines even at wavelengths as short as 100 nm .",
    "the carbon monoxide ( co ) molecule has its first dissociation limit beyond 10 ev , and its spectrum in the range 80 - 120 nm is characterized by strongly perturbed rovibronic resonances , where virtually all lines undergo predissociation .",
    "these phenomena are of great importance for the investigation of the chemical dynamics of the interstellar medium , in particular of star - forming regions , where the photodissociation of co is the governing dynamical process and co is , at the same time , the coolant molecule  @xcite . the nitrogen molecule ( n@xmath1 ) , iso - electronic to co , has an onset of a dipole - allowed absorption spectrum at 100 nm , while its spectrum is similarly perturbed and prone to predissociation .",
    "the photoabsorption of n@xmath1 is of great importance for the dynamics of the upper layers of the earth s atmosphere , and recently the importance of n@xmath1 photo - predissociation for the interstellar medium is increasingly recognized  @xcite .",
    "the dipole - allowed absorption spectrum of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) has its strongest lines in the lyman and werner bands in the wavelength range @xmath2 nm .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic studies and high - accuracy wavelength calibration studies of these sharp h@xmath1 resonances has become of specific relevance for studies searching for a possible variation of the proton - electron mass ratio on a cosmological time scale  @xcite .    in the domain of high - resolution studies of atoms in particular",
    "the ground state of the helium atom has been the target of many detailed studies over decades .",
    "this two - electron system is amenable for accurate _ ab initio _ calculations including quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects .",
    "the accurate determination of the ground state lamb shift has been a driving force for the development of vuv - lasers and vuv - laser spectroscopic techniques since the first laser excitation of the first resonance line in the helium atom  @xcite .",
    "techniques of harmonic generation in gases for the production of tunable radiation in the vuv domain have become well - established over the years .",
    "although resonant sum- and difference - frequency techniques have many advantages to produce the best intensities and to cover a wide wavelength range  @xcite , the approach of non - resonant third - harmonic generation has certain advantages for studies where absolute frequency calibration is the central concern . the setup displayed in fig .",
    "[ pda ] shows an example of a narrowband tunable laser system , based on a traveling - wave pulsed three - stage pulsed dye amplifier ( pda ) , which is seeded by the output of a continuous wave ( cw ) ring dye - laser  @xcite . by this",
    "means laser pulses of fourier - transform limited bandwidth are produced , corresponding to the pulse duration ( 5 ns ) of the frequency - doubled nd : yag laser employed for pumping the pda .",
    "the intense pda pulses ( typically 200 mj ) are easily converted to the uv via second harmonic generation in a kdp crystal . upon focusing the uv pulses underneath the orifice of a pulsed valve in a jet of xenon ,",
    "third harmonics are generated , therewith producing vuv pulses at the exact 6@xmath3 harmonic of the fundamental . when running the ring dye laser in its operating range of @xmath4 nm , tunable radiation in the vuv range of @xmath5 nm can be produced . in view of the pulses",
    "being somewhat shortened in the non - linear upconversion process , the typical duration is @xmath6 ns and the bandwidth in the vuv is about 250 mhz .",
    "this bandwidth slightly exceeds the fourier - bandwidth due to chirp effects in the dye amplifier and harmonic upconversion .    * figure  [ pda ] *    the main advantage of the system displayed in fig .",
    "[ pda ] is that the vuv output is governed by the exact 6@xmath3 harmonic of the seed - frequency , a property which may be exploited in the accurate calibration of the measured resonances in the vuv .",
    "the frequency of the ( cw ) seed - light is accurately calibrated by performing saturated absorption spectroscopy on i@xmath1 , for which the individual hyperfine components are known to an accuracy of 1 mhz  @xcite .",
    "the separation between an i@xmath1 resonance at the the fundamental and the vuv - resonances at the 6@xmath3 harmonic is then bridged in terms of fringes from a stabilized etalon , locked to a stabilized hene - laser .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ h2line ] , showing a recording of a specific line in the lyman band system of the h@xmath1 molecule . as in many experiments employing laser - based vuv radiation ,",
    "a measurement scheme is chosen employing 1 vuv + 1 uv resonance - enhanced two - photon ionization . in this scheme",
    "the vuv radiation resonantly excites a high - lying state in the atomic / molecular system , which is then further ionized by the spatially and temporally overlapping uv beam , i.e. the leftover beam from the harmonic conversion in the gas jet .",
    "the error budget of vuv absolute frequency measurements contains contributions of statistics , and of systematic effects related to the ac stark effect ( induced primarily by the uv beam ) , and the residual doppler effect due to non - perfect perpendicular alignment of the laser beams with respect to the collimated molecular beam .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is related to possible chirp effects in the pulsed laser beams , as a result from time - dependent gain in the dye amplifiers .",
    "experimental methods have been developed to determine the effect of this chirp on the measured transition frequency , and even to compensate the chirp effect by adapting the phase of the incident seed - light by an electro - optic modulator  @xcite .",
    "* figure  [ h2line ] *    a comprehensive study has been performed on the vuv absorption spectrum of h@xmath1 with the focus on accurate wavelength calibration for all the lines in the lyman ( b@xmath7 - x@xmath8 ) and werner ( c@xmath9 - x@xmath8 ) bands  @xcite .",
    "similar calibrations were performed on the hd isotopomer  @xcite .",
    "these studies provide a database of accurate absolute wavelengths for all h@xmath1 and hd absorption lines , at an accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "this database forms an ingredient for a study of possibly varying constants on a cosmological time scale .",
    "thereby use is made of the equation : @xmath11 making a comparison of the wavelengths @xmath12 as obtained from astronomical observations at high redshift @xmath13 to the wavelengths @xmath14 in the database ( at zero redshift @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the overall redshift of an absorbing galaxy with observable h@xmath1 abundance in the line of sight toward a quasar source .",
    "the final factor on the right hand side of the equation represents the possible effect of a drifting proton - electron mass ratio @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the relative change in its value . for a comparison based on eq .",
    "( [ drift - eq ] ) a calculation of sensitivity coefficients @xmath19 is required .",
    "their values can be calculated from the known level structure of the h@xmath1 molecule , by semi - empirical methods via  @xcite : @xmath20 data on high - redshift h@xmath1 absorptions are derived from astronomical observations using the largest optical dishes and high - resolution spectrometers ( the very large telescope with the uves spectrometer , and the keck telescope with the hires spectrometer ) .",
    "a comparison to accurate laboratory wavelengths , and invoking the calculated @xmath19 sensitivity constants then leads to estimates on a possible variation of the proton - electron mass ratio .",
    "the most detailed studies  @xcite yield the overall result that the proton - electron mass ratio has not changed by more than 0.001 % , or @xmath21 for redshifts of @xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to look - back times of 10 - 12 billion years .",
    "this important result relies on the accurate laboratory calibration of h@xmath1 and hd spectroscopic lines in the vuv .",
    "* figure  [ he - resonances ] *    harmonic generation in the perturbative regime , hence at power densities of @xmath23 w/@xmath24 , usually is restricted to @xmath25 harmonics .",
    "however , with the high - power frequency - doubled pda - laser system of fig .",
    "[ pda ] small amounts of @xmath26 harmonics could be produced , therewith producing the narrowest bandwidth pulses at wavelengths as short as 58 nm  @xcite .",
    "based on such a vuv system the @xmath27 - @xmath28 resonance line of the helium atom could be excited at a resonance width of 600 mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ he - resonances ] ) .",
    "careful analysis of systematic effects , in particular the chirp - effects in the pda - system and in the harmonic conversion process , allow for an experimental accuracy on the resonance line of @xmath29 and a determination of the lamb shift in the he ground state at an accuracy of 45 mhz  @xcite .",
    "at incident power densities of @xmath30 w/@xmath24 a sequence of harmonics can be produced , known as the plateau region  @xcite . in order to reach the plateau threshold with laser pulses as narrow as possible in the frequency domain",
    ", a laser system was built generating high - power pulses at 300 ps duration  @xcite .",
    "a combination of techniques was employed as shown in the setup of fig .",
    "powerful pump pulses at 300 ps duration were generated by stimulated brillouin scattering in a compact configuration using liquid methanol as the nonlinear medium  @xcite .",
    "these pulses pumped a pulsed - dye amplifier , injection seeded by the output of a cw ti : sa laser , running on infrared dyes with typical excited state lifetimes of 300 ps .",
    "this allows for producing pulses of 300 ps , tunable in the range 700 - 850 nm at a repetition rate of 10 hz .",
    "further amplification in a ti : sa preamplifier and a seven - pass ti : sa bow - tie amplifier resulted in pulses of @xmath31 mj / pulse at a fourier - transform limited bandwidth of 1.5 ghz with a fourier - product of @xmath32 . after focusing the pulses with a lens with a focal distance of @xmath33 cm , harmonics up to @xmath34 were generated  @xcite . in this",
    "process chirp phenomena cause a rather large broadening of the bandwidth of the pulses in the vuv  @xcite .",
    "this is the result of blue - shift effects from ionization in the early part of the pulse , and red - shift effects due to the plasma expansion in the trailing part of the pulses .",
    "moreover , the combination of pulse duration and peak intensity causes the interaction volume to become fully ionized already during the front part of the pulse .    *",
    "figure  [ pico ] *    this vuv picosecond source was employed in a spectral recording of the he @xmath27 - @xmath35 resonance line at 52.2 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ he - resonances ] .",
    "the linewidth in the spectrum , amounting to 30 ghz , is mainly the result of the chirp effects in the harmonic generation process .",
    "this is a limiting factor to the achievable resolution for this design of a vuv source .",
    "the ultra - short pulses from a femtosecond laser are seemingly not useful for spectroscopic studies in view of the fourier - principle , dictating that such pulses exhibit an almost white spectrum . however",
    ", if the phase relationships between consecutive pulses are controlled and used in combination , the perspective alters drastically .",
    "this is ultimately reached in a frequency comb laser where full control is achieved for an infinite pulse train , thus delivering a mode spectrum : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the repetition frequency of the modelocked frequency comb , @xmath38 the carrier - envelope offset frequency , and @xmath39 a large integer number .",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be measured or locked against an atomic clock reference so that all modes of the comb laser are known with high precision  @xcite .",
    "the production of high - order harmonics in the plateau region can be easily achieved for the ultrashort pulses from a frequency comb laser , in particular when a single pulse - pair is selected from the pulse train and subsequently amplified in a non - collinear optical parametric amplifier  @xcite . under the condition that no extra phases are imposed upon the laser pulses in the amplification process nor in the harmonic conversion process ,",
    "the resulting comb spectrum after conversion into the vuv is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is again an integer and @xmath42 is the integer harmonic order .",
    "the phase build - up in the amplifiers can be measured by interferometric techniques  @xcite , while the phases acquired in harmonic conversion can be measured as well  @xcite , and are therefore left out of consideration .",
    "it is noted however , that only the _ difference _ in phase build - up between consecutive pulses under consideration , @xmath43 , is of relevance .    in case",
    "two consecutive pulses are selected from a full pulse train emanating from a frequency comb laser the mode spectrum stays the same , except for the fact that the modes are no longer sharp spikes , but are diffused into a cosine - modulated mode spectrum . upon harmonic conversion of the double - pulse structure the same mode structure as in eq .",
    "( [ vuv - modes ] ) is retained  @xcite but again as a cosine modulation .",
    "this sequence of manipulative steps on the comb structure and the spectrum is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ xuv - steps ] .",
    "* figure  [ xuv - steps ] *    when using such double pulses for measuring a transition at frequency @xmath44 in an atomic system , one has to scan the time separation @xmath45 between the two pulses so that an excitation spectrum is obtained of the form : @xmath46   \\label{excitation}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that additional phase difference effects are controlled and may be neglected , so that @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "the resulting cosine - modulated excitation spectrum is displayed in fig .  [ fc - comb ] representing a measurement of the @xmath27 - @xmath48 transition in helium , using the 15@xmath3 harmonic of a ti : sa frequency comb laser at a wavelength of 51 nm in the vuv .",
    "* figure  [ fc - comb ] *    this form of two - pulse delayed time - domain spectroscopy may be compared to ramsey s separated zone oscillatory field spectroscopy , where now the separation is in the time domain rather than in the spatial domain . in particular when using all pulses from a frequency comb laser it is usually referred to as _ direct frequency comb spectroscopy _",
    "@xcite , and as in all absolute frequency measurements employing frequency comb lasers the central mode number , in this case the integer @xmath41 of eq .",
    "( [ vuv - modes ] ) , must be determined .",
    "this is accomplished by performing the measurement for a number of repetition rates @xmath37 of the laser ; for this purpose the cavity of the comb laser was redesigned to allow for settings between 100 mhz and 185 mhz  @xcite .",
    "this study results in an accurate value of the ionization potential of the helium atom as well as a determination of the he ground state ( at the @xmath49 accuracy level ) , including a value for the lamb shift of the he ground state as accurate as 6 mhz  @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of non - laser based spectroscopies the technique of fourier - transform ( ft ) spectroscopy has been been known as an important tool combining high resolving power and accurate intrinsic wavelength calibration .",
    "moreover , the interferometric technique exhibits a multiplex advantage .",
    "the entire spectrum of the light source employed is covered at once in the spectral decomposition obtained by fourier - transforming an interferogram . while ft - spectroscopy is widely used in the infrared domain as an analytical sensing tool , it is used in the optical domain and even in the vuv domain down to wavelengths of 140 nm  @xcite , but operation in all cases",
    "depends on a beam - splitter as a crucial optical element of the interferometer .",
    "a recent development in vuv spectroscopy is the operation of a wave - front division setup to generate an interferogram between two spatial parts of a propagating beam at vuv wavelengths , without the use of transmitting materials .",
    "the scanning interferometer , shown in some detail in fig .",
    "[ rooftop ] , exploits the delay imposed by two rooftop reflectors shifted with respect to each other .",
    "the stability and step - increments of the reflector displacement of the spatial scanning instrument should be kept under extreme control , i.e. within a fraction of the wavelength , in order to generate the interferograms .",
    "this is accomplished by probing the motion of one of the roof - shaped reflectors using a hene laser control interferometer .",
    "such a ft - vuv device was developed at the soleil synchrotron , where it is operated at the beam - line desirs at wavelengths in the range 40 - 200 nm  @xcite .    * figure  [ rooftop ] *    the output of the undulator - based beam line delivers a beam of sufficient transverse spatial coherence to operate in wave - front division .",
    "a bell - shaped output spectrum of typically 7% bandwidth against the continuum background with sufficient power allows for the recording of interferograms on a vuv silicon photodiode , even in case of the lossy reflections on the roof - shaped reflectors .    as an application example , a spectrum of high - resolution study of the hd molecule is shown in fig .",
    "[ hd - ft ]  @xcite .",
    "an aspect of the ft - vuv spectrometer is that only linear _ absorption _ spectra can be recorded , imposing the disadvantage of doppler broadening as a limitation . in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ hd - ft ] , taken at room temperature , the doppler width is the dominant factor in the linewidth amounting to 0.85 @xmath50 .",
    "recently , also static gas spectra with liquid - n@xmath1 and liquid - he cooling of the windowless flow cell were recorded to reduce the linewidth .",
    "in addition the operation of the novel ft - vuv instrument was also demonstrated in a gas - jet configuration thereby obtaining a linewidth of 0.2 @xmath50  in a spectrum of d@xmath1  @xcite .",
