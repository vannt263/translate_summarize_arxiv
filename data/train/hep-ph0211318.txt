    "we may quote renk , schneider and weise [ 1]:evidently , investigating the changes of spectral distributions of pseudoscalar and vector ( as well as axial - vector ) excitations of the qcd vacuum with changing temperatures and baryon densities , from moderate to extreme , is a key to understanding qcd thermodynamics , its phases and symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "\" studies related to that program may carried forward using lattice simulations of qcd or by using effective lagrangians .",
    "a good deal is known concerning the properties of qcd at finite temperature .",

    "we have also studied the excitations of the quark - gluon plasma by calculating hadronic current correlation functions at finite temperature [ 10 , 11 ] . in the present work we report upon calculations of such correlators at finite matter density in the deconfined phase . as in the large number of applications of the njl model and related models to the study of high - density matter [ 12 - 15 ]",
    ", we do not consider explicit gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "our calculations do not take into account the formation of diquark condensates associated with color superconductivity .",
    "one reason for not studying diquark condensates and related matters at this time is that we have some concerns as to the use of the njl model with constant values of the coupling constants at high density or high temperature .",
    "it is easier to discuss the matter of temperature - dependent effective coupling constants [ 8 , 10 ] than to discuss density - dependent coupling constants [ 9 ] , since a good deal is known about qcd thermodynamics at finite temperature .",
    "we denote the critical temperature for the confinement - deconfinement transition as @xmath3 and have used @xmath4 mev in our work [ 8 , 10 ] . from studies of a pure gluon system in qcd",
    ", it is found that at high temperatures one approaches a weakly interacting system slowly , with some nonperturbative effects still present at temperatures @xmath5 or 4@xmath3 [ 16 ] . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that we can neglect nonperturbative effects for @xmath6 .",
    "for these high temperature we would expect to be able to calculate hadronic current correlators using the njl model and obtain the result expected in lowest - order perturbation theory at energies for which the effective lagrangian may be used .",
    "( in that regard , we limit our applications to @xmath72 . )",
    "however , we found in our studies that the calculated hadronic current correlations functions had resonant features for @xmath8 , when _ temperature - independent _ coupling constants were used [ 11 ] .",
    "that was one of a number of reasons that we replaced the temperature - independent coupling constants of the njl model by @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "( we remark that other dependence on the parameter @xmath10 may be assumed , however , we have only explored the linear dependence described here . ) by analogy , we may introduce @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath2 is the critical density for the confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "in our earlier work [ 9 ] we took @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the density of nuclear matter .",
    "our introduction of the parameter @xmath14 was not done in a systematic fashion in ref . [ 9 ] , but the values used were @xmath15 .",
    "for the present work , we have used the same value of @xmath12 and have taken @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath17 , we have assumed that the system has limited nonperturbative features .",
    "since we are not describing diquark condensation in this work , we might limit ourselves to consideration of @xmath18 values larger than , but not too different from @xmath2 . however , here we will also study the larger values of @xmath19 in order to gain information about a possible density - dependence of the njl coupling constants , in analogy to what was done in the case of our finite temperature studies [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] .",
    "our calculations are made for zero values of the chemical potential .",
    "thus , we can present our results for hadronic current correlators for various values of @xmath20 .",
    "when calculations are made in that manner , we can present a particularly transparent discussion of the role of  pauli blocking \" .",
    "our model for quark matter is that of two ideal fermi gases of up and down quarks with fermi momentum @xmath21 .",
    "the density of the quark matter is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of colors .",
    "that expression may be put in contrast to the expression for the density of nuclear matter , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fermi momentum of the ideal gas of nucleons . with our form of @xmath26",
    "we see that , in our model , we have assumed that at @xmath27 the system is weakly interacting , since @xmath28 at that density",
    ". we may ask if we can apply the njl model at such high densities . when @xmath29 , we find @xmath30 gev . here",
    "we have used @xmath31 gev for nuclear matter . since",
    "a typical ( sharp ) three - momentum cutoff for the standard njl model is 0.631 gev [ 11 , 17 ] , we see that it is still possible to use the njl model at the largest density considered here .",
    "( it is possible to extend the range of application by using a larger momentum cutoff for the njl model .",
    "however , the cutoff is usually fixed by fitting the pion decay constant , so that the range of variation of the cutoff parameter is limited [ 17 - 19 ] . )    in this work we study the correlators which involve the excitation of states with the quantum numbers of the @xmath18 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons .",
    "the organization of our work is as follows . in sec .",
