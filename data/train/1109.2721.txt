    "by the end of the 20th century , in particular , since the birth of spintronics , thin films and nanostructures have gained increasing importance in industrial applications .",
    "the increasing demand for ultra - high density magnetic data storage devices had been one of the greatest driving forces of research and development involving nanostructures . with current hard disk technology approaching the superparamagnetic limit , the study of finite temperature magnetism in thin films and nanostructures is inevitable . _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure methods give , in general , a very good description of the ground ",
    "state properties of solids .",
    "when trying to describe complex magnetic structures or finite temperature magnetism these methods are often used to generate parameters of spin models .",
    "it is by now widely accepted that relativistic corrections to the heisenberg model , especially the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) interaction , play an important role in determining the magnetic ground state of some systems.@xcite moreover , higher order interaction terms ( multiple spin interactions ) also have to be considered in many cases @xcite to give an accurate description of magnetism .",
    "very recent studies indicate that such interactions may even lead to the formation of exotic states like magnetic skyrmion lattices.@xcite    in the present work we demonstrate the use of spin models from first principles for the description of magnetism , in particular , determining the ground",
    " state spin configuration of thin film systems .",
    "we use the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) combined with the relativistic disordered local moment ( rdlm ) theory to obtain model parameters .",
    "the sce - rdlm method has just been successfully applied to the irmn@xmath1/co(111 ) interface , a prototype for an exchange bias system , to calculate exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies.@xcite    here we go beyond the tensorial heisenberg model@xcite by including biquadratic couplings in the spin hamiltonian and present our results for thin films of fe on the ( 001 ) surface of fcc ir .",
    "previous theoretical studies have found that in case of a single fe overlayer the favored magnetic configuration depends very strongly on layer relaxations , leading to the formation of spin spiral states near the experimental geometry.@xcite we study the effect of layer relaxations on the magnetic interactions for the case of a monolayer , as well as the effect of higher order interactions on the spin configuration .",
    "we also examine thicker films consisting of two and four layers of fe to see whether the bulk ferromagnetism of fe emerges with increasing film thickness .",
    "experiments have shown that thin films of fe consisting of 4 or more monolayers produce a ferromagnetic signal in magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) measurements with an in - plane easy axis.@xcite the results of our simulations turn to be consistent with the main experimental findings .",
    "the most widely used ab initio methods to describe itinerant magnetic systems rely on the adiabatic approximation separating fast single ",
    "electron spin fluctuations from the slow transversal motion of the spins.@xcite furthermore , in the so - called rigid spin approximation it is assumed that longitudinal fluctuations of the local moments are negligible , so that the system of @xmath2 moments is characterized by a set of unit vectors @xmath3 describing the orientation of each local moment .",
    "then the grand potential @xmath4 of the system may be thought of as a classical spin hamiltonian,@xcite which can be used in numerical simulations to study the various magnetic properties of the system .    for practical applicability",
    ", the energy must be parametrized in a simple yet meaningful way .",
    "the most common approximation is a form of a generalized heisenberg model , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the second order on - site anisotropy matrices and tensorial exchange couplings , respectively .",
    "the latter can be meaningfully decomposed into an isotropic component @xmath8 , an antisymmetric component @xmath9 and a traceless symmetric part @xmath10 .",
    "the isotropic component describes a heisenberg interaction , the antisymmetric part corresponds to the dm interaction@xcite in the form of @xmath11 and the final component contributes to the so - called two - site anisotropy . in this paper",
    "we go beyond the second order expansion of eq .   and include isotropic biquadratic interaction terms of the form @xmath12 .",
    "even though a parametrization of the energy with a spin hamiltonian possesses a much less direct connection to the magnetic properties of the system , it can be used well to simulate the magnetic behavior .",
    "one method for obtaining the parameters of the spin hamiltonian directly from first principles calculations is the so - called spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) combined with the relativistic disordered local moment scheme ( rdlm ) .",
    "the spin - cluster expansion developed by drautz and fhnle@xcite gives a systematic parametrization of the adiabatic energy surface .",
    "up to two - spin interactions , the grand potential may be expanded using real spherical harmonics as @xmath13 where the summations do not include the constant spherical harmonic function of the composite index @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficients in eq .   are defined as @xmath15 where vectors in lower index indicate restricted averages , i.e. , uniform directional averaging has to be carried out with respect to every spin in the system not noted in the lower index .",
    "the terms of the spin hamiltonian can be directly related to the terms of the sce , for instance the isotropic biquadratic couplings can be expressed as @xmath16 clearly the key quantities of the sce are the restricted directional averages of the grand potential .",
    "the dlm scheme gives a description of a magnetic system in accordance with the adiabatic approximation .",
    "its implementation within the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) theory was given by gyrffy _",
    "et al._,@xcite with a relativistic generalization by staunton _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite combining it with the sce provides a highly effective tool for determining the parameters of spin models . for a detailed presentation of the sce - rdlm method",
    "see ref .  .",
    "in the following we will review the most important features of the theory .",
    "the electronic charge and magnetization densities are determined from a self - consistent - field kkr calculation . in good moment systems",
    "the magnitude of local moments may be considered as independent from their orientation . for a given set of self - consistent potentials , charge and local moment magnitudes , the orientations @xmath17 of the local moments",
    "are accounted for by the similarity transformation of the single - site @xmath18-matrices , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath18-matrix for a given energy , @xmath21 ( not labeled explicitly ) , with exchange field along the @xmath22 axis , and @xmath23 is the representation of the @xmath24 rotation that transforms @xmath25 into @xmath26 .",
    "underlines denote matrices in the @xmath27 angular momentum representation .",
    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) is employed to describe the magnetically disordered system .",
    "the strategy of the cpa is to substitute the disordered system with an effective ( coherent ) medium which is independent from the orientation of local moments , such that the scattering of an electron in the effective medium should resemble the average scattering in the disordered physical system .",
    "the scattering path operator of the effective medium is defined as @xmath28 where double underlines denote matrices in site - angular momentum space , @xmath29 is the matrix of structure constants , and @xmath30 is site diagonal . using the excess scattering matrices defined as @xmath31^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the single - site cpa condition can be formulated as @xmath32    within validity of the magnetic force theorem the grand potential of the system can be expressed in terms of the excess scattering matrices and the related impurity matrices @xmath33^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given spin configuration and at zero temperature as @xmath34,\\label{grandpot - rdlm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant term reads as @xmath35 @xmath36 being the integrated density of states of free electrons .",
    "eq .   can be used to calculate restricted averages of the grand potential for the sce , eqs .",
    ". in particular the two - site expansion terms are expressed as @xmath37,\\label{sce - rdlm-2site}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] implying that higher order two - site terms , such as biquadratic couplings , see eq .",
    "( [ bij ] ) , can be calculated just as easily as tensorial heisenberg interactions .",
    "we used the screened korringa  kohn ",
    "rostoker ( skkr ) method@xcite to perform self - consistent calculations for fcc bulk ir and the layered fe / ir(001 ) systems .",
    "the in - plane lattice constant for the fcc lattice was chosen 2.715  .@xcite we used the local spin - density approximation parametrized according to ceperley and alder,@xcite and we employed the atomic sphere approximation with an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath38 .",
    "a scalar - relativistic dlm description was used , corresponding to the paramagnetic state .",
    "matrices of the effective cpa medium were determined to a relative error of 10@xmath39 .",
    "we used 12 energy points on a semicircular path on the upper complex half - plane for the energy integrations , and 78 points were sampled in the irreducible wedge of the 2d brillouin zone ( bz ) for @xmath40-integrations .",
    "the spherical integrations needed for the sce , as in eq .  , were performed according to the lebedev ",
    "laikov scheme.@xcite the logarithm in eq .",
    "was expanded into a power series to avoid the phase problem due to the energy integration of the complex logarithm .",
    "firstly we performed calculations for the case of an fe monolayer .",
    "along with the unphysical case of an unrelaxed fe monolayer , systems with different layer relaxations were considered , namely 5% , 10% , 15% inward relaxations as well as the experimental value of -12% relaxation.@xcite according to kudrnovsk",
    "_ et al._,@xcite we may expect a very strong dependence of exchange parameters on the layer relaxation , with a crossover of dominant heisenberg couplings from ferromagnetic ( fm ) to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) .",
    "the obtained isotropic couplings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fe1ir - isos ] .     as a function of interatomic distance in units of the in - plane lattice constant , @xmath42 . ]    while for the unrelaxed geometry all significant couplings are fm , with increasing inward relaxation the couplings for the three nearest neighbor ( nn ) shells become gradually afm . for the case of experimental layer relaxation ,",
    "the magnitude of the heisenberg interactions is small and comparable up to four shells . while the tendency of the obtained curves is similar to those calculated by kudrnovsk _",
    "et al._,@xcite there are remarkable differences .",
    "in particular , at the experimental layer relaxation our largest isotropic couplings are 1  mry smaller than those obtained in ref .  , corresponding to a difference by a factor of three . since the tb - lmto - sgf method is known to give results that agree very well with kkr we use , we performed a series of check calculations to verify the reliability of our results . increasing the numerical precision of the spherical integrations of the sce , the convergence parameters of the cpa and the number of @xmath40 points for the bz integration all resulted in identical isotropic couplings within linewidth .",
    "increasing the number of energy points from 12 to 16 used for the energy integrations in the self - consistent calculations also leads to relative differences less then 2% .",
    "we also performed calculations with spin - orbit coupling scaled to zero@xcite as well as with the parametrization of the lda according to vosko , wilk and nusair.@xcite the differences in the dominating exchange interactions from both sets of calculations were less then 0.1  mry indicating that such factors are insufficient to explain the quantitative difference between our interactions and those of kudrnovsk _",
    "et al_.@xcite    due to the frustrated nature and small magnitude of the isotropic exchange interactions it is possible that dm interactions or biquadratic couplings affect the ground  state spin configuration .",
    "the magnitude of these interactions for the first two nn  shells is shown in table  [ fe1ir_dms_bijs ] . for higher relaxation values , in particular for the experimental one , the correction terms are indeed comparable to the isotropic couplings . interestingly ,",
    "in our case the biquadratic couplings all have positive sign indicating that these interactions favor collinear spin configurations .",
    "this feature implies a competition between the frustrated afm exchange couplings , the dm and the biquadratic interactions , possibly leading to complex ground  state spin configurations .",
    ".calculated dm interactions and isotropic biquadratic couplings , see eq .",
    "( [ bij ] ) , in @xmath43 .",
    "all values are given in mry units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in contrast to bulk bcc fe , the net magnetization points along the @xmath44 direction , i.e. , towards intralayer second - nearest neighbors , but it is indeed in - plane .",
    "possibly in even thicker films we would see fm order with easy axis along the ( 100 ) direction , as was found experimentally .",
    "we used the recently developed sce - rdlm method to obtain spin hamiltonians from _ ab initio _ calculations , going beyond the anisotropic heisenberg model by including isotropic biquadratic interaction terms .",
    "the obtained interaction parameters allow for a detailed investigation of the magnetic ground state via a mean field approach and atomistic spin dynamics simulations .",
    "we presented results for fe thin films on the ( 001 ) surface of a semi - infinite ir substrate .",
    "for the case of an fe monolayer we found that layer relaxations drastically rearrange the interaction landscape , leading to the appearance of complex non - collinear spin structures .",
    "relativistic corrections , in particular , dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , are needed to be taken into account as anisotropic couplings largely affect the ground state .",
    "spin dynamics simulations also revealed that including biquadratic interactions to the spin model significantly alters the ground state spin configuration by favoring a more collinear state .",
    "this serves as an instructive warning that in some systems the usual heisenberg model might give an insufficient description of magnetic properties .    for thicker films of two and four monolayers we found that biquadratic couplings are irrelevant in determining the ground ",
    "state spin configuration due to the large magnitude of the heisenberg interaction .",
    "while the bilayer system still produces a single-@xmath0 spin spiral as ground state due to the dm interaction , in the quadrilayer system there is nonzero net magnetization superimposed on a cycloidal spin structure .",
    "this finding may be consistent with experimental results showing a ferromagnetic signal in moke measurements above four monolayers of fe deposited on ir(001 ) .",
    "financial support was provided by the hungarian research foundation ( contract no .  otka k77771 and k84078 ) and by the new szchenyi plan of hungary ( project i d : tmop-4.2.1/b-09/1/kmr-2010 - 0002 ) .",
    "josef kudrnovsk and vaclav drchal are gratefully acknowledged for fruitful and stimulating discussions .",
    "for a system of spins @xmath45 governed by the grand potential @xmath46 , the best variational mean field trial hamiltonian @xmath47 , i.e. , the one that minimizes the free energy is given by @xmath48 where the angle brackets now denote thermodynamic averaging with respect to the mean field probability distribution @xmath49/z_0 $ ] , @xmath50 being the corresponding canonical partition function .    for our spin model extended with an inhomogeneous external field ,",

    "note that neither the on - site anisotropy nor the biquadratic couplings contribute to the weiss field .",
    "the spin susceptibility , defined as @xmath56 may be related to the susceptibility of the non - interacting spin system @xmath57 as @xmath58 for layered systems with only two - dimensional translation invariance we may separate site indices according to a layer index and an in - plane index , @xmath59 where capital indices denote layers . due to in - plane translation invariance we may introduce the two - dimensional fourier transform of the quantities , for instance @xmath60 which might be thought of as blocks of matrices in layer and cartesian space , @xmath61_{ij}=\\bm \\chi_{ij } \\!\\left(\\vec q\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using this notation we may easily invert eq .   and arrive at @xmath62 indicating an enhancement of the spin susceptibility due to the heisenberg interaction . in the paramagnetic limit this simplifies to @xmath63 annealing the system from the paramagnetic phase",
    "there will be a temperature , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 becomes singular , indicating that the paramagnetic phase is unstable to the formation of some magnetically ordered state at that temperature .",
    "this transition temperature @xmath64 is given by the condition @xmath66 and the corresponding @xmath67 where this happens gives the characteristic wave vector of the ordered phase ( where the @xmath67 vectors are sought for in the two - dimensional bz ) .",
