    "the off - diagonal response has a leading contribution , the intrinsic spin hall conductivity , that is completely independent of disorder and is property of the host bloch bands .",

    "several researchers have pointed out that in the rashba 2deg case , ladder vertex disorder corrections  @xcite in the kubo formula lead to a vanishing spin hall current .",
    "the same conclusion has been reached via quantum boltzmann theory@xcite calculations which capture the same physics .",
    "these vertex correction claim is specific to the r2des case , and has specifically been discounted for two - dimensional hole gases  @xcite , p - doped bulk semiconductors and the modified rashba coupling case .",
    "@xcite several numerical studies basing on the landuer - buttiker approach in mesoscopic systems with leads also have been performed , but lack of clear trends in the size dependence of the spin hall conductances they evaluate@xcite , and the possibility of edge effects near the contacts , can not be connected to the possibility of the spin hall effect in the thermodynamic limit .    in this article",
    "we approach these issues numerically by evaluating the finite - size kubo formula@xcite for the spin hall conductivity for two - dimensional electrons with three different spin - orbit coupling models .",

    "( the models we study have only two - bands and it is usually convenient to consider them as representing the two spin states of a spin-@xmath5 particle . ) the presence of diagonal matrix elements means that current will not decay in a perfect crystal and the longitudinal conductivity ( and hall conductivity ) is consequently limited by disorder scattering of bloch states .",
    "we start from a linear response kubo formula approach:@xcite _ ^()&=&- where k_^(+i)&=&-_0^dte^i(+i)t , [ eq : kernel ] @xmath6 is the @xmath7 component spin or charge current in @xmath8 direction , and @xmath9 is the volume of the system .",

    "the longitudinal conductivity ends up being dominated by terms that are diagonal in band index at each current vertex and end up being proportional to the bloch state scattering time @xmath4 .",
    "this contribution captures the boltzmann theory physics in which the current is due to field induced changes in the occupation probabilities of bloch states .",
    "it turns out that the spin hall conductivity does in general have a corresponding contribution , but only if scattering violates the principle of microscopic reversibility , _",
    "i.e. _ only if the @xmath13 scattering rate is not equal to @xmath14 scattering rate where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are bloch states .",
    "indeed this property is violated when scattering amplitudes are evaluated beyond the born approximation , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] , and the spin hall conductivity ends up being proportional to @xmath17 , where the _ skewness _ @xmath18 is a measure of the violation of microscopic reversibility . @xcite the terminology we use here is borrowed from the theory of the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors , which is strongly analogous to the spin hall effect in paramagnetic metals and semiconductors .",
    "we identify the contribution to the spin hall conductivity that is proportional to @xmath4 and due to changes in bloch state occupation probabilities , _",

    "this quantity is a property of the band structure of the perfect crystal , hence the term intrinsic .",

    "the renormalized current with the ladder correction is given by solving the vertex equation , & & * j*(;z , z)= ( ) + & &  + _  g(,z)*j*(;z , z)g(,z ) .",
    "explicit evaluation of this ladder sum correction requires some approximations and can normally be accomplished only for very simple disorder models , or in the limit of small spin - orbit interactions",
    ". these limitations of perturbation theory motivate the numerical study reported on here .",
    "we have reported previously on the influence of disorder on the spin hall conductivity of the k - linear rashba model , concluding that it remains finite in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite this conclusion is at odds with our current numerical findings , extrapolating to infinite system size and then to zero frequency , which are consistent with the perturbation theory conclusion that the dc spin hall conductivity of this model is zero .",
    "the numerical studies are complicated by the strong frequency dependence and large fluctuations in the spin hall conductivity that occur in finite - size calculations .",
    "the earlier calculations erred by using the frequency dependence of the longitudinal conductivity , which has corrections that vary like @xmath22 compared to the @xmath23 dependence of the spin hall conductivity discussed below , to judge whether or not the _ dc _ limit has been reached .",
    "the new findings supersede the conclusions reached in ref . [ ] with regards to the thermodynamic _ dc _ limit .",
    "our numerical results for the k - linear and k - cubic rashba models are now consistent with analytic calculations which consider only the thermodynamic limit within the diffusive regime , hence resolving the controversy that has been associated with the linear rashba model.@xcite    in the k - cubic rashba model , which approximately describes two - dimensional valence band holes in a narrow quantum well with structural inversion asymmetry@xcite , the spin hall conductivity does not show measurable @xmath2 dependence .",
    "for this model , its @xmath20 limit is consistent with the pure intrinsic value .",
    "this observation suggests that the spin hall induced edge spin accumulations@xcite recently seen in two - dimensional hole systems@xcite follows from the intrinsic spin hall effect .",
    "we also study a modified rashba interaction which combines elements of the k - linear and k - cubic rashba model and provides an approximate model for conduction band quantum well states in inverted gap materials like hgte.@xcite as we explain below the modified model has spin - orbit splitting that varies like @xmath24 , as in the k - cubic rashba model , but a wavevector dependent zeeman field whose in - plane orientation rotates once when the wavevector rotates once around the fermi surface as in the k - linear rashba model . in perturbation theory , the second property implies that an angular integral that appears in the vertex correction calculation and ( for short - range impurity scattering ) vanishes in the k - cubic rashba model , is non - zero .",
    "vertex corrections to the intrinsic spin hall conductivity survive for the modified model .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate , however , that the corrections are present but do not cause the total spin hall conductivity to vanish as it does for the k - linear rashba model .",
    "the special property of the k - linear rashba model that causes the spin hall conductivity to vanish is related to the equation of motion of the spin - operator.@xcite    our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the spin - orbit coupling and disorder terms in the model we study numerically .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction can be described in terms of a position and momentum dependent zeeman field , whose orientation variation as a function of wavevector plays the key role in spin hall conductivity calculations for these models .",
    "the disorder model we employ assumes a scalar random potential .",
    "we argue that as long as the random potential is dominantly spin - independent , this assumption is not essential . in section iii",
    "we introduce the finite - size - system kubo formula which expresses the spin hall conductivity in terms of hamiltonian eigenstates of a finite size two - dimensional electron system with area @xmath25 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the spin hall conductivity evaluated using this formula tends to fluctuate wildly from disorder realization to disorder realization and is very sensitive to avoided level crossings that occur close to the fermi energy .",
    "these fluctuations are conveniently mitigated by evaluating the spin hall conductivity for a continued complex frequency @xmath26 along the imaginary axis .",
    "the _ dc _ spin hall conductivity should be evaluated by first letting @xmath27 and then @xmath28 . our expectation is that for systems much larger than a mean - free - path in size , @xmath25 dependence will appear only for @xmath29 smaller than or comparable to the finite size level spacing @xmath30 .",
    "thus we should be able to extrapolate to the _ dc _ value as long as systems sizes can be reached numerically that are large enough to make other characteristic energy scales like the spin - orbit splitting and the life - time broadening energy @xmath31 , much larger than @xmath32 . in sec .",
    "iv we present our numerical results for the finite - size kubo formula and discuss its extrapolation to infinite system sizes . in section v we discuss a spectral representation for the spin hall effect and some associated sum rules . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss the equation of motion of the spin operator for the k - linear rashba model .",
    "using the fact that the time derivative of the spin operator is proportional to the spin hall current for this model , we are able to demonstrate that the finite size spin - hall conductivity is always zero when averaged over boundary conditions . the typical size of the spin - hall conductivity fluctuation in a given finite size system , is however , much larger than the intrinsic spin hall conductivity . finally in sec .",
    "vii we present our conclusions .",
    "we base our studies on a series of models with generalized rashba spin - orbit interaction of the form : h=^2 ^2/2m+ig(||)(k_-^_+-k_+^_- ) where @xmath33 is the effective carrier mass , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is either unity or a function of @xmath36 .",
    "( we set @xmath37 for simplicity . ) the rashba model for an inversion asymmetric conduction band quantum well is generated by choosing @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "valence band quantum wells have a more complex structure.@xcite in the thin quantum well limit , light hole bands become energetically irrelevant and the heavy hole bands can be effectively described by eq.(1 ) with @xmath40 , the so called k - cubic rashba model .",
    "we study in addition a modified rashba model with @xmath41 and @xmath38 ( @xmath42 @xmath43\\cdot\\vs$ ] ) , which provides an approximate model for conduction electron quantum well states in inverted gap materials.@xcite in the following we use the fermi energy @xmath44 and the inverse fermi wave number @xmath45 in the absence of both spin - orbit coupling and disorder as the units of energy and length respectively .",
    "we take a disorder model consisting of uncorrelated short - range scalar impurity potentials : @xmath46 which satisfies @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier component of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the number of impurity scatterers which we take to correspond roughly to the number of carriers .",
    "we choose this type of disorder potential model , rather than the more realistic finite correlation length model utilized in previous studies @xcite in order to connect more directly with the analytical results .",
    "we diagonalize the finite - size disordered electron hamiltonian in the @xmath51 eigenstate basis and introduce a hard cutoff at a sufficiently large momentum @xmath52 .",
    "( this means , of course , that the disorder potential has an effective correlation length @xmath53 . )",
    "our calculations are performed at a fixed carrier density @xmath54 and at finite system sizes ( see below ) up to @xmath55 , larger than the mean free path @xmath56 and the fermi wavelength @xmath57 .",
    "finally we introduce the charge and spin current operators .",
    "the charge current definition , @xmath58 follows from the charge conservation continuity equation , where the vector potential @xmath59 must be included to obtain a gauge invariant expression . in a system with a spin - rotational hamiltonian charge spin components along arbitrary quantization axes",

    "a continuity equation expresses local conservation of each cartesian component of spin .",
    "we retain the same definition when spin - orbit interactions are included , although the continuity equation is now violated because the hamiltonian is spin - dependent .",

    "the vector potential change gives rise to a perturbation @xmath131 : ( ) & = & -_0^dte^i(+i)t / l^2 + & = & -_n , nn|s_|nn|j_|n . + [ dsda ] for a square finite size system with side @xmath132 , a change in vector potential by @xmath133 corresponds to a change in the boundary condition phase by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the electron flux quantum .",
    "using the relation between the time dependence of the spin operator and the spin - current operator , it follows that @xmath136 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmash ] ) we find that _",
    "^z(z)=(z ) .",
    "[ eq : sigmar2 ] where @xmath137 is a complex frequency .",
    "this is an exact expression for the k - linear rashba model with arbitrary scalar impurities . for a disordered r2des @xmath138 in general",
    "has a boundary condition and disorder potential dependent expectation value @xmath139 , corresponding therefore to a spin - density per unit volume that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "because the @xmath140 value of the spin density response to vector potential is proportional to the derivative of the ground state spin density with respect to boundary condition phase angle in the direction of the vector potential , @xmath141 it is evident that the average of the @xmath140 value of this response function over boundary conditions is zero .",
    "( since the spin - density must be a periodic function of @xmath142 with period @xmath143 , the integral of its derivative over any period must vanish . in eq.([eq : relationtosx ] ) @xmath142 is the boundary condition phase angle in the @xmath144-direction and @xmath145 $ ] . )",
    "this appears to be the conclusion that can most confidently be drawn about kubo formula properties from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdot ] ) . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the typical value of the spin hall conductivity at a particular boundary condition is large in magnitude , indicative of large persistent spin currents in finite size systems .",
    "our numerical results for the spin - hall conductivity appear to be consistent with the natural _ ansatz _ that averaging over boundary conditions is equivalent to averaging over disorder realizations in finite - system calculations of the spin - hall conductivity .",
    "the fact that these averages at @xmath146 appear to yield the same values for the spin - hall conductivity as extrapolations from @xmath86 , guarantees that the equation of motion argument for vanishing spin hall conductivity in the linear rashba model is valid .",
    "we note that it is possible to establish that the spin - hall conductivity vanishes at integer landau level filling factors in the absence of disorder without appealing to a concrete calculation by using total spin equation of motion identities . in this case",
    ", the boundary condition phase angle @xmath142 just corresponds to an @xmath147-direction guiding center shift in a translationally invariant system . in sharp contrast to the zero field case",
    ", there is no @xmath142 dependence in the absence of disorder ; the result for any boundary condition equals the zero result obtained by averaging over boundary conditions .",
    "because of the gap between landau levels , no subtleties arise in taking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the spin hall conductivity clearly vanishes at any integer filling factor .",
    "there literature contains some arguments that the spin hall conductivity vanishes for any model .",
    "for example ,",
    "sheng et al.@xcite have performed a numerical simulation similar with present work , and have concluded that the spin hall effect of source of the zero spin hall conductivity of the linear rashba model is more general . in particular they argue that because all energy eigenvalues have anti - crossing behavior as a function of boundary conditions ( or equivalently flux @xmath148 through a cylindrically shaped sample ) spin transports can not arise .",
    "we note that the linear response regime attains with external field @xmath149 small compared with all relevant energy scales but larger than the level spacing @xmath30 to generate landau - zener tunneling through anti - crossing gaps .",
    "consequently the adiabatic argument of ref .",
    "[ ] can not capture the linear response of the spin transport .",
    "we rather conclude that strong suppression of the spin hall conductivity is an accidental property of particular models , not a generic effect .",
    "as we have seen in this article the k - cubic model gives a good example of a model for which the intrinsic spin hall effect is dominant .",
    "the spin hall effect observed in this model can be understood as an intrinsic effect@xcite .",
    "we note that the spin hall effect is observed as spin accumulation .",
    "although there is no analytic theory of spin accumulation due to an intrinsic spin hall effect , we note that numerical studies of spin accumulation@xcite show little accumulation in the k - linear rashba model and robust accumulation in the k - cubic model .",
    "these results are consistent with the present spin transport study and a naive theory of spin accumulation .      from the equation of motion for the density matrix",
    "it follows quite generally that the time derivative of the spin - density can be related to the equation of motion for the averaged spin - density : @xmath150.\\ ] ] in the steady state which balances acceleration by an external electric field with disorder scattering , the density matrix @xmath151 is constant and the spin - density is expected to saturate at a finite value .",
    "as discussed above , it follows from this argument that @xmath152 $ ] vanishes .",
    "it is interesting to compare the single - band semiclassical theory of spin transport@xcite with this result . in a homogeneous system this theory describes the spin - density dynamics by the following equation : & = & _ tr + & = & - j^z , int _ - .",
    "[ dsdt ] the first term in the first form for the right hand side corresponds to the spin torque term which describes spin - density dynamics in the absence of collisions .",
    "the effect of collisions which scatter electrons between bloch states is accounted for by the second term.@xcite in the final form for the right hand side",
    "we have introduced the relaxation time approximation for the scattering term and recognized that the collision free expression for the spin - density evolution is proportional to the hall spin - current in the absence of collisions and hence to the intrinsic spin hall conductivity . in the strong spin - orbit scattering limit on which we focus",
    ", the spin relaxation time@xcite that appears in this equation may be approximately identified with the momentum relaxation time .",
    "the steady state in - plane spin - density induced by an electric field is proportional to the intrinsic spin hall conductivity and to the momentum relation time @xmath4 .",
    "we know that above semiclassical argument of the spin - hall conductivity fails to capture vertex corrections , because it does not properly account for the influence of disorder on the interband components of the density matrix response.@xcite since vertex corrections also change the value of the in - plane spin induced by an electric field,@xcite this theory may also fail to account quantitatively for the value of in - plane spin - density induced by an external electric field .",
    "in this article , we have studied spin transport driven by an electrical potential bias in two - dimensional electron and hole systems with spin - orbit coupling due to structural inversion asymmetry , primarily using finite - size exact diagonalization as a tool .",
    "we have studied three different models of spin orbit coupling , the standard k - linear rashba model , a k - cubic rashba model appropriate for two - dimensional hole systems in narrow quantum wells , and a modified k - linear rashba model with eigenspinors like that of the standard rashba model and eigenvalues like that of the k - cubic rashba model . in these systems a current of spins oriented perpendicular to the two - dimensional layer flows perpendicular to the direction of the electric field , an effect known as the spin hall effect . for the models we have studied",
    "the expectation value of the spin current in the perfect crystal bloch eigenstates is zero , implying that there is no skew - scattering - induced bloch state occupation number change contribution to the spin hall effect .",
    "the spin hall effect is entirely due to interband coherence induced in the system by the electric field .",
    "when disorder is treated perturbatively the spin hall effect can be separated into an intrinsic contribution that is a property of the perfect crystal electronic structure along , and a disorder - related vertex correction contribution that remains finite even when the scattering rate vanishes .",
    "this vertex - correction is partially analogous to the scattering angle weighting correction that vertex corrections introduce into the theory of the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "the three models we study differ qualitatively on how vertex corrections alter the intrinsic spin hall effect .",
    "we evaulate the spin hall conductivity numerically for a finite system and at a finite frequency @xmath67 continued to the imaginary axis .",
    "the frequency @xmath29 can be thought of as a turn on rate for an electric field , or as energy level broadening due to the coupling of the small system being studied numerically to the rest of a macroscopic sample .",
    "the thermodynamic limit _ dc _ spin hall conductivity must be calculated by first letting the system size become large and then letting @xmath28 ; the vertex correction appears as a dependence of the spin hall conductivity on @xmath93 . in the k - linear rashba model",
    "we find that the spin hall conductivity depends strongly on @xmath93 , vanishing for @xmath28 .",
    "this finding is consistent with analytical calculations have shown that the vertex correction strongly suppresses the intrinsic contribution to the spin hall conductivity for this model .",
    "for the k - cubic rashba model we find that vertex corrections vanish , a finding that may hold only for the short - range disorder scattering model we apply .",
    "for the modified k - linear rashba model , the vertex corrections do not vanish and alter the intrinsic spin hall effect by a fraction that decreases with increasing spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "taken together , these results demonstrate that the intrinsic interband spin hall conductivity can be altered by vertex corrections , depending on details of the electronic structure and the disorder potential .",
    "the special situation which leads to a vanishing total spin hall conductivity for the k - linear rashba model is related to the relationship between spin equations - of - motion and spin - currents that applies only for systems with spin - orbit coupling that is linear in momentum .",
    "since the spin hall conductivity of the k - cubic model is purely interband , and vertex corrections are weak for this model , we conclude that the spin - hall - induced spin accumulation observed in a two - dimensional hole gas by wunderlich _ et al._@xcite ( for which the k - cubic model is applicable ) , must be due primarily to the intrinsic spin hall effect .",
