    "the velocity of the wave , @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 , is constant over the full propagation range from 200 to 750 mm .",
    "we also studied the wave kinematics separately for different propagation sectors ( not shown in fig .",

    "the velocity derived for different directions is the same within the error bars but the brightness is quite different for the propagation into the western and eastern direction ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1a ] and the online movies ) .",
    "these findings imply that the propagation speed does not vary with the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "the lateral observations of the wave from st - a clearly reveal its 3d nature , with the wave front visible to a considerable height above the solar surface ( last panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we compare the wave kinematics as observed on - disk from st - b with those derived from the limb - observations in st - a .",
    "since st - a has an edge - on view of the wave , the distance measurements are basically free from projection effects . we also show how the data from two observing platforms separated by @xmath290@xmath7 can be used to estimate the typical heights of the wave observations in on - disk measurements .",
    "the red asterisks in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] show the wave kinematics as obtained from st - a by measuring the wave evolution along the solar limb , i.e.  at a height of 0@xmath8 .",
    "the resulting data points lie 50100  mm behind the kinematical curve derived from the on - disk st - b observations , indicating that the wave propagates significantly above the solar surface .",
    "however , if we just increase the spherical surface on which the wavefront observed by st - a is measured , we are not able to obtain a reasonable agreement with the wave kinematics derived from st - b on - disk observations .",
    "this is demonstrated by the red x  symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] , showing the wave kinematics derived along a spherical surface at a height of @xmath9 above the solar limb . considering the 3d nature of the wave ,",
    "projection effects have to be taken into account in the st - b on - disk observations .",
    "the st - b on - disk observations are then a result of integrating the emission from the wave front high above the solar surface along the line - of - sight ( illustrated by the long arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] ) . assuming a height of 130@xmath8 ( @xmath290  mm ) for the wave observations projected onto the solar surface , the wavefront distances and velocities derived from st - a and st - b are in agreement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] ) .    what do we learn from this ?",
    "first , the emission of euv waves observed on - disk originates from high above the solar surface ( @xmath280100  mm ) .",
    "this is similar to the height of @xmath2@xmath10  mm derived for a global euv wave observed with stereo at a spacecraft separation of 45 using triangulation techniques @xcite .",
    "such heights are comparable to the coronal scale - height of 50100  mm for quiet sun temperatures of 12  mk , and consistent with the propagation of a mhd fast - mode wave over quiet sun regions , since the wave perturbs and compresses the ambient coronal plasma with its bulk confined within a coronal scale - height @xcite .",
    "second , the derived wave height of about 80100  mm is not the upper edge ( see also the right panel in fig .  [ fig5a ] ) but reflects the maximum of the line - of - sight integration of the increased intensity due to the plasma compression at the wave front .",
    "third , there may be an underestimation of about 10% of the coronal wave speed derived from the disk - observations ( @xmath11  km  s@xmath1 ) with regard to the `` real '' propagation velocity at heights of 80100  mm , where we find @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the early evolution of the erupting cme associated with the coronal wave is observed with high - cadence by st - a , basically free from projection effects .",
    "this enables us to study the expansion of the erupting cme with relation to the wave propagation . in order to enhance the coronal structures above the limb",
    ", we removed the steep radial intensity gradient by a normalizing - radial - graded filter ( nrgf ; * ? ? ?",
    "a bulb - like pre - cme structure is observed hours before the event , and starts to erupt around 05:3005:35ut ( fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] ) .    in order to follow in detail the cme take - off and lateral expansion in the low corona",
    ", we selected various vertical slices in the plane of sky from the nrgf - filtered euvi - a 171  images ( available at a cadence of 2.5  min ) at different coronal heights . in fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] , we show three stack plots extracted from @xmath13-slices centered at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( indicated in the first panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] ) covering the length @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "these plots reveal the pre - existing cme structure as well as the expansion of the cme flanks .",
    "( though we note that the stack plots include also some contribution of the cme upward movement in addition to the expansion . )",
    "the bifurcation of the bright horizontal feature indicates the onset of the lateral expansion of the cme . in the @xmath18 ( @xmath19  mm ) stack plot ,",
    "the bifurcation starts at @xmath205:32ut with the fastest growth around 05:35ut . for @xmath20 ( @xmath21  mm ) , the fast onset occurs later by about 23  min .",
    "the expansion stops at @xmath205:50  ut for @xmath18 and at @xmath206:00  ut for @xmath20 . in the @xmath14 slice , which is low in the corona ( @xmath22  mm ) ,",
    "only a marginal cme expansion is observed , revealing the anchored ends of the cme flanks .",
    "studying stack plots at various heights ( @xmath23-positions ) , we find that the coronal wave onset ( @xmath205:35ut ) is consistent with the cme lateral expansion at coronal heights in the range 70120  mm . at the slice @xmath18 (",
    "@xmath24  mm ) , shown in fig .  [ fig_kin ] , the expansion starts around 05:32 reaching the fastest growth at @xmath205:35ut .",
    "this suggests that the wave is initiated between @xmath205:3205:35ut by the cme expanding flanks , and thereafter propagates freely . in the last panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] , we show a euvi - a 195  high - contrast ratio image at 06:05ut , which clearly reveals the coronal wave ( above the limb as well as on the disk ) far away from the erupting structure .",
    "from the stereo quadrature observations of a coronal wave observed simultaneously in frontal and lateral view , we find that the euv emission of the coronal wave originates at a height of about 80100  mm .",
    "the wave propagation speed ( corrected for projection effects ) is @xmath2260  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the wave speed is constant over the full range of quiet - sun region it traversed and homogeneous in all directions though the perturbation amplitudes are quite different for different propagation directions ( in particular toward the western and eastern direction as observed from st - b ) .",
    "this is a different behavior compared to the wave observed by stereo on 19 may 2009 , which revealed a distinct deceleration from @xmath2450 to 200  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the associated flare x - ray flux is very weak ( goes b2.3 ) , which suggests that the flare pressure pulse is unlikely to be causing the wave .",
    "the first observations of the wave coincides with the onset of fast expansion of the cme expanding flanks at a height of @xmath2@xmath25@xmath26  mm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] ) suggesting that this expansion initiates the wave .",
    "afterwards , the wave propagates freely and is far ahead of the observed cme flanks ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] ) . such a behavior",
    "was also observed in the euvi event studied in @xcite .",
    "this offset of the wave front with respect to the projected cme flank is not in line with the behavior expected from the `` pseudo - wave '' models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the wave front should be basically co - spatial with the cme front . from the stack plots in fig .",
    "[ fig_kin ] and from direct measurements of the cme expanding flanks , we find that the peak velocity of the lateral cme expansion at a fixed height of @xmath290  mm is @xmath2150  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this provides us with an estimate of the driver speed .",
    "these findings ( driver speed smaller than wave speed ; constant wave velocity over the full observation range , i.e.  not varying with amplitude ) indicate that we are dealing with a fast - mode mhd wave not too far from the linear regime . in this case",
    ", we would expect the wave to propagate at the characteristic speed of the medium ( i.e.  the fast magnetosonic speed ) , independent of the amplitude of the perturbation . a fast magnetosonic speed in the range of 260  km  s@xmath1 is not unreasonable for quiet sun coronal conditions in the deep solar minimum .",
    "recently , direct magnetic field measurements of the corona were deduced by @xcite who obtained a field strength of 4 gauss above an active region at a height of @xmath21.1  r@xmath4 . assuming for quiet sun conditions a magnetic field strength in the range of 1 to 3 gauss and a coronal density of @xmath27  @xmath28 , the fast magnetosonic speed lies in the range 210 to 350  km  s@xmath1",
    "which is consistent with the observed wave velocity .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observed euv transient is a real wave , and that its observational characteristics is consistent with a low - amplitude mhd fast - mode wave ( i.e.  not a shock wave ) .",
    "finally , we note that there is a recent paper on the same event @xcite .",
    "these authors basically arrive at the same conclusions of a fast - mode mhd wave but use a different approach , modeling the cme and wave structures based on euvi and cor observations .",
