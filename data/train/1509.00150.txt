    "one statement of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) is that any uncharged test body traveling in empty space will follow a trajectory independent of its internal structure and composition . for test bodies with macroscale masses",
    ", the accuracy of the eep can be measured in a newtonian context . however , for test particles like photons and neutrinos , newtonian dynamics is no longer precise enough . to test the accuracy of the eep at this level , at least the lowest - order deviations from newton s law of universal gravitation",
    "are required , which can be conveniently described by the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism .",
    "for all metric theories of gravitation in which all bodies satisfy the eep , the ppn formalism explicitly details the parameters in which a general theory of gravity can differ from newtonian gravity .",

    "a gravity theory can be tested through the absolute values of ppn parameters .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out that the time interval required for photons to traverse a given distance is longer in the presence of a gravitational potential @xmath3 by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the location of the source of particle emission and @xmath6 that of observation @xcite .",
    "half of the delay is caused by the warping of space by the gravitational field , the other half can be thought of as a result of gravitational redshift . here",
    "@xmath7 is one of the ppn parameter , representing how much space curvature is produced by unit rest mass .",
    "different gravity theories predict different values for @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , general relativity predicts that @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "many precise methods have been devised to test the accuracy of general relativity through the measurement of the value of @xmath0 , the most precise being the measurement of the gravitational deflection of light near the sun and the round - trip travel time delay of an artificial radar signal due to the solar system gravity @xcite :    * the most precise results from the deflection of light is through very - long - baseline radio interferometry measurement , yielding @xmath9  @xcite ; * the most precise results from the travel time delay of a radar signal , which is also the most precise constraints on the @xmath0 value to date , is from the doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft , yielding @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath8 is not a sufficient condition to identify general relativity , since it is not the only theory that predicts @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "regardless of the absolute value of @xmath0 , all metric theories of gravity that incorporate the eep predict that all test particles ( photons or neutrinos ) must follow identical trajectories and undergo the same time delay , even though the delay time may vary between different theories . in other words , as long as the eep is valid , all metric theories predict @xmath11 ( and @xmath0 need not even be 1 ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent two different test particles . in this case , the accuracy of the eep can be characterized by limits on the differences of @xmath0 value for different species of particles , or the same specie of particle with varying energies .    it has been proposed that the close coincidence in time of arrival of the photon and neutrino bursts from the supernova 1987a provides a strong test of the eep @xcite . comparing the arrival time delay of the photons and neutrinos , @xcite proposed that the @xmath7 values for photon ( ev ) and neutrino ( mev ) are identical to an accuracy of approximately @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the very small dispersion in arrival times observed for neutrinos of different energies ( @xmath15 ) can be used to set a limit on the energy dependence of @xmath16 to the level of @xmath17 .",
    "supernova 1987a is an extragalactic source , but non - cosmological . in this work",
    ", we propose that the time delays between correlated photons from cosmological transients , such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , can also be used to constrain the eep with similar approaches . in the following ,",
    "we first discuss the general picture of using cosmic transients to constrain the eep . taking grbs as an example",
    ", we then show the ability of this method for improving the constraints , and discuss the uncertainties involved .",
    "cosmic transient sources often show some time delays between different energy bands .",
    "the main terms that might contribute to this time delay may be expressed as follows : @xmath18 in the following , we discuss each component in turn .",
    "* @xmath19 is the intrinsic ( astrophysical ) time delay between two test photons , and this has the largest uncertainty since it is impossible to determine it based on the observational data alone .",
    "appropriate assumptions for the radiation mechanism are usually required to assign a chronological order for the different energy photons , but it is still hard to estimate the exact value of @xmath19 . *",
    "@xmath20 represents the potential time delay due to lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) via an energy - dependent velocity of light .",
    "some descriptions of it are based on quantum fluctuations in the back- ground space - time metric causing a non - trivial dispersion in vacuo for light propagating through this space - time foam @xcite .",
    "taking into account the effect on the propagation of photons due to the expansion of the universe , even a tiny variation in photon speed may lead to an observable time delay @xcite , @xmath21 which is the n - th ( first non - vanishing term ) of a series expansion in an effective field theory formulation of quantum gravity including lorentz invariance violating terms . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the energies for two test photons ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the effective energy scale of quantum gravity , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the present hubble expansion rate and @xmath28 the hubble parameter at different redshifts . for a limiting @xmath25 equal to the planck energy , the recent evidence disfavors the existence of linear ( order @xmath29 ) liv terms ,",

    "it is easy to show that the higher order terms of the expansion ( @xmath30 ) , even if they exist , are negligible for the purposes of this work . , the @xmath31-th expansion of @xmath32 becomes negligible for the purposes of this work ( e.g. , much smaller than the order of a second ) .",
    "] we thus ignore this term in the following analysis .",
    "* @xmath33 represents the potential time delay due to special - relativistic effects in the case where the photons have a rest mass which is non - zero , which reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the photon rest mass .",
    "modern experiments have provided the upper limits for the photon rest mass as @xmath36 @xcite . in this case , @xmath33 is negligible even when the energy of test photons are lower than radio band .",
    "* @xmath37 corresponds to the difference in arrival time of two photons of energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 , caused by the gravitational potential @xmath3 integrated from the emission site to the earth , which can be estimated with equation [ eq : gra ] , as long as the expression of @xmath3 is known , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy - independent speed for massless particles . in general , @xmath3 can be divided into three parts : the gravitational potential of our galaxy @xmath40 would be dominant out to a certain distance , say to the edge of the local group ( @xmath41 mpc ) .",
    "based on the cosmological principle and current cmb results , the gravitational potential should gradually approach a flat background intergalactic potential @xmath42 between our galaxy and the host galaxy ( or cluster ) of the transient .",
    "this assumption may be valid at least for sources with @xmath43 , for which the lensing probability is significant only to @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the final contribution is from the gravity well of the host galaxy ( or the relevant galaxy cluster ) @xmath45 .    leaving out the negligible components , equation [ eq : deltat ] is @xmath46 for a specific case where high energy photons arrive later than the low energy photons ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "if we know that @xmath48 , we will have @xmath49 the potential function for @xmath42 and @xmath45 is hard to model , but it is very likely that the effect of these two terms is much larger than if we simply assumed that the potential is just @xmath40 extended to the distance of the transient , i.e. , @xmath50 although the gravitational potential of the milky way at large distances is still not well known , @xcite examined two popular potential models , e.g. , the keplerian potential @xmath51 and the isothermal potential @xmath52 $ ] , for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the circular speed at the solar radius and the potential becomes keplerian for @xmath55 .",
    "they proposed that different models for @xmath40 do not have a strong influence on the results for testing eep . in this work",
    ", we adopt the keplerian potential for our galaxy .",
    "thus , for the purposes of obtaining a lower limit , we can simply extend this galactic potential out to cosmic scales to bracket from below the potential function of @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "we thus have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gravitational constant , @xmath58 is the mass of our galaxy @xcite , @xmath59 is the distance from the transient to earth , and @xmath60 is the impact parameter of the light rays relative to the center of the galaxy . for a cosmic source in the direction ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , the impact parameter can be estimated as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the distance from the sun to the galaxy center , and ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) are the coordinates of the galaxy center in the equatorial coordinate system ( j2000 ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that a more accurate formulation for @xmath40 may provide higher order corrections to equation [ eq : gamma ] , but the correction would be absorbed into the approximation obtained from replacing @xmath42 and @xmath67 with the extension of @xmath40 .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are the most extreme explosive events in the universe .",
    "they were initially observed as short , intense , and non - repeating flashes of @xmath68 @xmath0-rays .",
    "later on , it was found that the initial burst is usually followed by a longer - lived broadband emission ( x - ray , ultraviolet , optical , infrared , microwave and radio ) , showing that grbs are actually multi - wavelength transients , instead of simply bursts of @xmath0-rays .",
    "the initial mev @xmath0-ray emission is often called the ",
    "prompt emission  , while the longer wavelength emission is referred to as the  afterglow emission  .",
    "it is worth noticing that in some bursts , the longer wavelength emission , e.g. optical emission , sometimes already starts during the prompt emission phase .",
    "the duration of the prompt emission is relatively short , ranging from @xmath69 s to @xmath70 s.",
    "morever , the histogram of the duration shows a bimodal structure separated at 2 s , where bursts with duration less than 2 s are classified as short - grbs and those that last for more than 2 s are called long- grbs .",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "grbs are interesting cosmic transients for obtaining eep constraints for the following reasons :    * even the @xmath0-ray photons are usually observed in different energy bands , for instance , the two instruments onboard fermi , the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; @xcite ) and the large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite ) , provide unprecedented spectral coverage for seven orders of magnitude in energy ( from @xmath718 kev to @xmath71300 gev ) . * the observed @xmath0-ray lightcurves in each energy band often have violent variability , with minimum timescales as small as milliseconds @xcite .",
    "it is easy to use these sharp features to identify the arrival time lag between different energy photons . *",
    "thanks to the prompt slewing capability of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the uv - optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) onboard the swift satellite @xcite , longer wavelength photons have been observed at very early times after the grb trigger , even during the prompt emission phase .",
    "it is thus possible to determine the arrival lag between @xmath0-ray photons and low energy photons , such as optical photons .",
    "after four decades of observation , thousands of grbs have been studied in significant detail , making it possible to find some good examples that can be used to constrain the eep . in this work , we take two examples , grb 090510 and grb 080319b .",
    "grb 090510 first triggered the fermi - gbm on a precursor at @xmath72 ut , may 10th , 2009 , and the main emission episode in the @xmath73 energy range started @xmath74 s after @xmath75 , lasting up to @xmath41 s. then , @xmath76 s after the gbm trigger , it was detected and precisely localized by the _",
    "satellite , with coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath77 , @xmath78",
    "@xcite . the emission observed by the fermi- lat started 0.65 s after the gbm trigger and lasted @xmath79 s @xcite .",
    "the @xmath80 of the burst is @xmath81 s , placing it in the short grb category .",
    "subsequent observations determined its redshift as @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed in detail its prompt light curve over the different energy bands observed by fermi .",
    "they found that the total gbm light curve ( @xmath73 ) consists of seven main pulses , where the first one is a dim short spike .",
    "a single 31-gev photon was detected by lat at 0.83 s after the gbm trigger , which coincides in time with the last of the seven gbm pulses .",
    "the directional and temporal coincidence of this photon with the mev radiation of grb 090510 is very significant , at the @xmath83 confidence level @xcite .",
    "no high - energy ( gev ) photon has ever been detected before the onset of the low - energy ( mev ) emission in a grb , and this 31-gev photon similarly appears likely to have been emitted after the onset of grb 090510 . taking as our nominal time delay @xmath84 s , we thus have from eq.([eq : gamma ] ) for this burst @xmath85      grb 080319b was detected by swift at @xmath86 ut , march 19th , 2008 , with coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "it is a long burst with @xmath89s and located at @xmath90 @xcite . at the trigger time of this burst , the wide - field robotic optical telescope",
    " pi of the sky \" @xcite and the wide- field robotic instrument telescopio ottimizzato per la ricerca dei transienti ottici rapidi ( tortora ; @xcite ) both serendipitously had the grb within their fields of view ( as they were both already observing grb 080319a ) .",
    "a bright optical transient was observed starting at @xmath91s and peaking around 18s after the swift trigger .",
    "the peak v - band magnitude reached 5.3 , corresponding to a flux density of @xmath7128.7 jy @xcite .",
    "tortora measured the brightest portion of the optical flash with high time resolution , distinguishing three separate peaks which enabled doing detailed comparisons between the prompt optical and @xmath0-ray emissions .",
    "@xcite calculated the optical-@xmath0-ray correlation function for the entire prompt emission , and they found that for the contemporaneous rise at @xmath92 s and fall at @xmath93 s , the correlation coefficient has a maximum at lags between 0 and 5 s , while for the middle part of the prompt emission , the correlation function still has a peak at lags between @xmath94 to 3 s , but is less prominent . to be conservative , we adopt the largest value @xmath95 s as the arrival lag @xmath96 between the mev photons and the optical photons . from eq.([eq : gamma ] ) we thus have for this burst @xmath97",
    "in the last two sections , we have proposed a practical method for using cosmic transients for testing the energy dependence of the @xmath0 parameter quantifying departures from the eep , and we have taken grbs as an example to illustrate the capabilities of this method . in the following ,",
    "we discuss some of the uncertainties involved in this method and the caveats on our constraint results .",
    "the largest uncertainty is from the intrinsic time delay between two test photons , @xmath98 . since we are only seeking upper limits , in the calculations we neglected the @xmath19 term based on the assumption that @xmath19 has the same sign as @xmath99 .",
    "more specifically , here we assumed that the gev ( optical ) photons are intrinsically emitted later than ( or at most simultaneously with ) the mev photons in grb 090510 ( grb 080319b ) . from the observational point of view , such an assumption is empirically justified , since we have never observed any grbs with gev or optical photons arriving earlier than the mev photons . in standard grb models ,",
    "the mev photons are assumed to arise in internal shock regions via synchrotron emission , while gev photons are usually believed to originate from the inverse compton up - scattering of mev photons , and the optical photons are usually assumed to arise in the external shock region ( which is outer and occurs later than the internal shock ) also via synchrotron emission . in other words , from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "our assumption about the intrinsic order of gev or optical photons with mev photons is also standard practice .",
    "however , if in reality the gev or optical photons are emitted earlier than the mev photons , and @xmath100 , our constraint results would be invalidated .",
    "the second uncertainty comes from the determination of @xmath99 . for grb 090510",
    ", we chose @xmath99 as the time delay between the 31-gev photon and the trigger photons for the swift satellite .",
    "our results could be more stringent if in reality the 31-gev photon were correlated with the other gbm ( mev ) pulses , for example the seventh pulse which coincides in time with the gev photon @xcite .",
    "however , in principle , it would be conceivable that the gev photon is correlated with some other mev photons emitted earlier but which failed to trigger the swift satellite",
    ". this would be similar to a case where intrinsically this gev photon is emitted earlier than the mev photons , which could potentially invalidate our results .",
    "for grb 080319b , we adopted the time delay results from the optical-@xmath0-ray correlation function .",
    "these results should be reliable , since the tortora telescope provided high time resolution measurements for the brightest portion of the optical flash .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that our adopted delay time is even larger than the time delay between the onset times of the optical observations and the mev trigger .    the total mass and the exact gravitational potential function of our galaxy is not well known .",
    "more accurate values for @xmath101 or for the function @xmath40 could improve our constraints , but the correction should be limited to less than an order of magnitude .    in the calculations presented we neglect the time delay terms caused by the host galaxy and the intergalactic background gravitational potential . in principle , these terms could be much larger than @xmath102 . with future observations , and with a better understanding of the potential functions for these terms",
    ", our result could be improved by orders of magnitude .",
    "in principle , the accuracy of the eep may be characterized by limits on the differences between the @xmath0 values ( one of the ppn parameters ) for different species of particles , or for the same specie of particle at different energies . in this work",
    ", we propose that the time delays between correlated photons from cosmological transients , such as grbs , can be used to constrain the accuracy of the eep .",
    "using the data from two observed grbs as an example , and assuming that the observed time delays between photons of different energies are caused dominantly by the gravitational effects of our galaxy , an assumption which we justified in  2 , for the gev and mev photons of one burst we give an upper limit of @xmath103 ; and for the optical and mev photons form another burst we find @xmath104 .",
    "previous to this present work , the most accurate constraints on @xmath0 differences were based on the photons and neutrinos from supernova 1987a , giving an upper limit of @xmath14 for optical photons and mev neutrinos , and an upper limit of @xmath17 for two neutrinos , whose energy difference was of order @xmath71 mev .",
    "if our present interpretation is correct , our results increase the accuracy level of such eep constraints by at least one order of magnitude , to @xmath105 , while extending the energy range tested to the gev - mev and mev - ev range .",
    "a new type of transients , called fast radio bursts , have lately attracted attention @xcite .",
    "although their physical origin is still debated @xcite , if in the future they are proven to be cosmic transients , their simple sharp features make them attractive candidates for constraining the eep , which could further extend the tested energy range to the radio band with high accuracy .",
    "it is worth pointing out that high energy neutrinos have long been proposed to be associated with grbs , although a dedicated search of high - energy neutrinos coincident with electromagnetically detected grbs has so far led to null results @xcite .",
    "if in the future grbs with both high energy photons and neutrinos are detected , better constraints on eep might be achieved . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrino detectors such as icecube have reached the sensitivity to detect high - energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin for the first time .",
    "the three - year discovery catalog of icecube contains a total of 37 neutrino candidate events with deposited energies ranging from 30 to 2000 tev @xcite .",
    "although the origin of these neutrinos is still debated , some of them seem to have both spatial and temporal correlations , such as events 24 and 25 in the catalog @xcite . in the future ,",
    "if the origin of these neutrinos is better understood , or the association between different detected events is confirmed , it will be essential to use these high energy cosmic neutrinos for obtaining better constraints on the accuracy of the eep .",
    "the most precise previous constraints on the absolute @xmath0 value of photons is @xmath106 , which comes from radio photons .",
    "our relative limits are three orders of magnitude lower than this , focusing on the value of the difference between various energies , rather than the absolute value . on the other hand , the shapiro time - delay measurements using the hipparcos optical astrometry satellite yielded an agreement with general relativity of @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "based on our results , we can predict that the constraint on the absolute @xmath0 values mev or gev photons , which from the sources we investigated here differ from that of their corresponding optical photons by @xmath108 , should agree with gr at least to this same @xmath109 level of accuracy .",
    "thus , we have extended the validity of this absolute value bound on @xmath0 at this level from the optical to the gev range , and have constrained the relative variation of @xmath0 between optical and gev to the @xmath108 range .",
