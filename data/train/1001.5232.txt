    "a transport system is used to move goods from sources to targets . in building such a system ,",
    "one typically aims at minimizing the total transportation cost . this consideration has motivated the theoretical studies of many optimal transport problems .",
    "for instance , the well - known monge - kantorovich problem ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , caffarelli , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , villani ) studies how to find an optimal transport map or transport plan between two general probability measures with the optimality being measured by minimizing some cost function .",
    "applications of the monge - kantorovich problem to economics may be found in the literature such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present paper gives another application by introducing the economics notion of an `` exchange value '' which is suitable for a ramified transport system .",
    "_ ramified optimal transportation _ has been recently proposed and studied ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to model a branching transport system .",
    "an essential feature of such a transportation is to favor transportation in groups via a cost function which depends concavely on quantity .",
    "transport systems with such branching structures are observable not only in nature as in trees , blood vessels , river channel networks , lightning , etc . but also in efficiently designed transport systems such as used in railway configurations and postage delivery networks .",
    "those studies have focused on the cost value of a branching transport system in terms of its effectiveness in reducing transportation cost .    in this article , we show that there is another value , named as _ exchange value _ , embedded in some ramified transport systems .    as an illustration",
    ", we consider a spacial economy with two goods located at two distinct points @xmath0 and two consumers living at two different locations @xmath1 .",
    "the spacial distribution is shown in figure 1 .",
    "suppose consumer 1 favors good 2 more than good 1 . however , good 2 may be more expensive than good 1 for some reason such as a higher transportation fee . as a result",
    ", she buys good 1 despite the fact that it is not her favorite . on the contrary",
    ", consumer 2 favors good 1 but ends up buying good 2 , as good 1 is more expensive than good 2 for him .",
    "given this purchase plan , a traditional transporter will ship the ordered items in a transport system like @xmath2 ( see figure g_1 ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite etc , a transport system like @xmath3 ( see figure [ g_2 ] ) with some branching structure might be more cost efficient than @xmath2 .",
    "one may save some transportation cost by using a transport system like @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 .",
    "now , we observe another very interesting phenomenon about @xmath3 .",
    "when using this transport system , one can simply switch the items which leads to consumer 1 getting good 2 and consumer 2 receives good 1 .",
    "this exchange of items makes both consumers better off since they both get what they prefer .",
    "more importantly , no extra transportation cost is incurred during this exchange process . in other words , a ramified transport system like",
    "@xmath3 may possess an exchange value , which can not be found in other transport systems like @xmath2 .",
    "the _ exchange value _ concept of a transport system that we propose here is valuable for both economics and mathematics .",
    "existing market theories ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) focus on the mechanism of exchanges between economic agents on an abstract market with relatively few discussions on its form .",
    "our study complements the existing theories by showing that a transport system actually serves as a concrete market whose friction for exchange depends on the structure of the transport system as well as factors like preferences , prices , spatial distribution , etc .",
    "the existence of such an exchange value is due to the fact that the transport system provides a medium for potential exchange between agents . from the perspective of mathematical theory on optimal transport problem",
    ", our study provides another rationale for ramified structure which usually implies a potential exchange value .",
    "furthermore , a new optimality criterion needs to be considered when building a transport system which leads to a new mathematical problem . instead of simply minimizing the transportation cost , one might have to minimize the difference between transportation cost and exchange value .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the model environment with a brief review of consumer s problem and related concepts from ramified optimal transportation .",
    "sections 3 and 4 contain the main results of the paper .",
    "section 3 proposes an explicit valuation formula to measure the exchange value for a given compatible transport system .",
    "the exchange value is defined by solving a maximization problem , which has a unique solution under suitable conditions .",
    "criteria based on transport structures , preferences and prices are provided to determine the existence of a positive exchange value .",
    "we show that a reasonable combinations of these factors guarantees a positive exchange value .",
    "section 4 studies a new optimal transport problem with an objective taking into account of both transportation cost and exchange value .    in this paper , we will use the following notations :    * @xmath4 : a compact convex subset of a euclidean space @xmath5 .",

    "this follows from an analogous proof of proposition [ collinear2 ] , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "[ picture3 ]     to conclude this section , we ve seen how transport structures , preferences and prices jointly determine the exchange values .",
    "each of these factors may lead to a zero exchange value under very rare situations .",
    "more precisely , when the structure of the transport system yields a singleton feasible set @xmath297 ( corollary [ corollary_kl ] , proposition pairwise_dis)@xmath37 or the utility functions are merely quantity dependent ( proposition [ quantity_u ] ) , or price vectors are collinear across consumers ( proposition [ collinear1 ] ) , the exchange value is zero .",
    "however , under more regular situations , there exists a positive exchange value for a ramified transport system . for instance , if the utility functions satisfy the conditions in ( 3 ) of theorem [ theorem 1 ] with a non - singleton feasible set @xmath25 ( theorem [ theorem 1 ] ) or the transport systems are of ramified structures with some non collinear price vectors ( theorem [ colliner_general ] ) , there exists a positive exchange value .",
    "in the previous section , we have considered the exchange value @xmath170 for any @xmath144 .",
    "a natural question would be whether there exists a @xmath434 that maximizes @xmath435 among all @xmath144 .",
    "the answer to this question has already been provided in proposition upperbound as the particular transport path @xmath436 is an obvious maximizer . however , despite the fact that @xmath124 maximizes exchange value , it may be inefficient when accounting for transportation cost .",
    "nevertheless , as indicated previously , one should not neglect the benefit of obtaining an exchange value from a transport system . as a result",
    ", it is reasonable to consider both transportation cost and exchange value together when designing a transport system .",
    "recall that in @xcite etc , a ramified transport system is modeled by a transport path between two probability measures @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for each transport path @xmath164 and any @xmath437 $ ]",
    ", the @xmath438 * *  * * cost of @xmath21 is defined by @xmath439when @xmath440 , a y - shaped  path from two sources to one target is usually more preferable than a v - shaped  path . in general",
    ", a transport path with a branching structure may be more cost efficient than the one with a linear  structure .",
    "a transport path @xmath441 is called an @xmath442__optimal transport path _ _ if it is an @xmath438 minimizer in @xmath443 .",
    "given two atomic probability measures @xmath19 and @xmath20 on @xmath4 in an economy @xmath15 given by ( [ economy ] ) , find a minimizer of @xmath444among all @xmath144 , where @xmath445 is given by ( [ omega ] ) , and @xmath446 and @xmath447 are fixed constants .",
    "when the utility functions are merely quantity dependent ( proposition quantity_u ) or when price vectors are collinear across consumers ( proposition [ collinear1 ] ) , the exchange value of any @xmath448 is always zero . in these cases , @xmath449 for any @xmath450 .",
    "thus , the study of @xmath451 coincides with that of @xmath452 , which can be found in existing literature ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as seen in the previous section , it is quite possible that @xmath453 does not agree with @xmath452 on @xmath454 for @xmath455 in a general economy @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath456 is topologically invariant ( proposition [ topology ] ) , many results that can be found in literature about @xmath452 still hold for @xmath451 .",
    "for instance , the melzak algorithm for finding an @xmath452 minimizer ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in a fixed topological class still applies to @xmath451 because @xmath435 is simply a constant within each topological class .",
    "also , as the balance equation ( [ balance ] ) still holds , one can still calculate angles between edges at each vertex using existing formulas ( @xcite ) , and then get a universal upper bound on the degree of vertices on an optimal @xmath451 path .",
    "however , due to the existence of exchange value , one may possibly favor an optimal @xmath451 path instead of the usual optimal @xmath452 path when designing a transport system .",
    "the topological type of the optimal @xmath453 path may differ from that of the optimal @xmath452 path .",
    "this observation is illustrated by the following example .",
    "let us consider the transportation from two sources to two consumers . if we only consider minimizing @xmath438 transportation cost , each of the three topologically different types shown in figure [ fig5 ] may occur .",
    "however , when @xmath450 is sufficiently large , only @xmath3 in figure [ gb ] may be selected under suitable conditions of @xmath457 and @xmath140 .",
    "this is because @xmath3 has a positive exchange value which does not exist in either @xmath2 or @xmath458 .",
