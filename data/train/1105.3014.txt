    "recently , significant progress has been made in developing efficient numerical algorithms in the context of the tensor network ( tn ) representations  @xcite , as a consequence of our deeper understanding of the role of quantum entanglement and fidelity in characterizing critical phenomena in quantum lattice systems .",
    "actually , these developments provide significant insights into the working principle of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , which in turn has led to some novel algorithms based on the tn representations . among them",
    "are the matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite in one spatial dimension and the projected entangled - pair states ( peps )  @xcite in two or higher spatial dimensions .",
    "especially , an infinite mps ( imps ) algorithm  @xcite and an infinite peps ( ipeps ) algorithm  @xcite have been developed to compute the tn representations of ground - state wave functions for translationally invariant infinite - size quantum systems in one and two or higher spatial dimensions , respectively .",
    "a remarkable feature of these tn algorithms is that they offer an efficient way to compute the ground - state fidelity per lattice site  @xcite . indeed",
    ", quantum fidelity allows to capture the ground - state phase diagrams for various quantum lattice systems in condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "there are a class of quantum lattice systems lying between one and two spatial dimensions , namely , quantum spin ladders and tubes . both experiments and theories",
    "@xcite have confirmed that the spin 1/2 heisenberg ladders are gapful for an even number of legs and gapless for an odd number of legs .",
    "in fact , the ground state of an odd - leg heisenberg spin ladder is a gapless spin - liquid or a tomonaga - luttinger liquid  @xcite .",
    "once the periodic boundary conditions are applied in the rung direction , spin ladders become spin tubes .",
    "some exotic phenomena occur due to the geometric frustration for an odd - leg spin tube , which has been realized in some materials , e.g. , for three - leg  @xcite and nine - leg  @xcite spin tubes .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to these systems in the context of the tn representations .",
    "given the importance of both the spin ladders and spin tubes in the theory of strongly correlated systems , it is desirable to develop tn algorithms as an alternative means to investigate their fascinating physics .",
    "this paper is a part of our efforts to develop an efficient numerical algorithm for quantum spin tubes in the context of the tn representations , which offers an efficient way to compute the ground - state fidelity per lattice site .",
    "thus , we are able to locate quantum criticalities for quantum spin tubes . as an illustration , we investigate the isosceles spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic three - leg heisenberg tube .",
    "the simulation results suggest that two kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transitions occur as the degree of asymmetry of the rung interaction is tuned .",
    "and @xmath0 along the leg and rung directions , respectively . here",

    "one choice of the unit cell is highlighted in a dash - line box.,width=288 ]    assume that the model hamiltonian @xmath2 describes the nearest - neighbor interaction and is translationally invariant along the leg direction .",
    "for a 3-leg spin tube , there are six sites @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in each unit cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "such a choice of the unit cell is necessary to accommodate a ground state with spontaneously broken translational symmetry , as it does occur in spin tubes . indeed , there are two different choices of the unit cell : one is @xmath9 , as highlighted in fig .",
    "[ model ] , the other is @xmath10 .",
    "any wave function admits a tn representation , which follows from attaching to each site a five - index tensor , as visualized in fig .",

    "the dominant left and right eigenvectors of the transfer matrix are nothing but the environment tensors , in the sense that it accommodates the effect of the remaining part of the infinite - size spin tube system , once the system is partitioned into two parts , with one of them being the transfer matrix .",

    "we take advantage of the translational invariance of the hamiltonian . since there are two different choices of the unit cell , the contribution to the energy gradient involves six hamiltonian densities acting on different plaquettes , i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "it should be emphasized that the gradient decays very fast when the hamiltonian cell falls apart from the hole cell .",

    "we consider the antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 three - leg heisenberg tube , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ model ] , on an infinite - size lattice .",

    "the asymmetric parameter @xmath1 controls the strength of the frustration .",
    "if the asymmetric parameter @xmath1 is varied , the model exhibits two limiting cases : for @xmath68 , it corresponds to the three - leg ladder ; for @xmath69 , it becomes a decoupled system consisting of a single chain and a two - leg ladder .",
    "both of them are gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquids , with the central charge @xmath70 , and possess the @xmath71 symmetry . when @xmath72 , the system is spontaneously dimerized , arising from the geometric frustration .",
    "all the spin excitations are gapful , as follows from the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem  @xcite : two degenerate ground states arise from the broken translational symmetry .",
    "therefore , one may expect that at least one phase transition point occurs if the asymmetric parameter @xmath1 is tuned from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . from now on ,",
    "we fix @xmath67 and @xmath0 to be unity , and focus on the effect of the asymmetry of the rung interaction .",
    "previous studies for this model based on the dmrg simulations leads to somewhat controversial results : nishimoto and arikawa suggested that the spin gap vanishes as soon as the infinitesimally small asymmetry is introduced  @xcite , while sakai _ et .",
    "@xcite argued that a finite spin gap appears in a narrow region around the rung - symmetry line and the phase transitions between the gapless and gapful phases belong to the kt universality class .",

    "the simulation is performed for a randomly chosen initial state .",
    "the algorithm automatically produces degenerate ground states which pseudo - break the @xmath71 symmetry in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid phases . in the pseudo - symmetry - broken phase ,",
    "the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath89 , exhibits different values lying between two ( extreme ) degenerate ground states . in the symmetric phase , @xmath89 yields just one value .",

    "therefore , two phase transition points at @xmath94 and @xmath88 are identified from the bifurcation in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site .",

    "this implies that the degenerate ground states arise from the finiteness of the truncation dimension , an artifact of the algorithm .",
