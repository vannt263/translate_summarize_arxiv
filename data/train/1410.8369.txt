    "political opposition led to north carolina house bill 819/session law 2012 - 202 , which blocked the use of the 1 m projection for regulatory purposes and charged the science panel on coastal hazards to deliver an updated assessment in 2015 that considered _ `` the full range of global , regional , and north carolina - specific sea - level change data and hypotheses , including sea - level fall , no movement in sea level , deceleration of sea - level rise , and acceleration of sea - level rise '' _ @xcite . here",

    "relative sea level ( rsl ) is the difference in elevation between the solid earth surface and the sea surface at a specific location and point in time .",
    "commonly , it is time - averaged to minimize the influence of tides and is compared to the present as the reference period @xcite .",
    "rsl averaged over all ocean basins yields an estimate of gmsl .",
    "gmsl rise is driven primarily by ( 1 ) increases in ocean mass due to melting of land - based glaciers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ice sheets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( 2 ) expansion of ocean water as it warms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "changes in land water storage due to dam construction and groundwater withdrawal also contributed to 20th century gmsl change ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "rsl differs from gmsl because of ( 1 ) factors causing vertical land motion , such as tectonics , sediment compaction , and groundwater withdrawal ; ( 2 ) factors affecting both the height of the solid earth and the height of earth s geoid , such as long - term gia and the more immediate ` sea - level fingerprint ' static - equilibrium response of the geoid and the solid earth to redistribution of mass between land - based ice and the ocean ; and ( 3 ) oceanographic and atmospheric factors affecting sea - surface height relative to the geoid , such as changes in ocean - atmospheric dynamics and the distribution of heat and salinity within the ocean ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    along the u.s .",
    "atlantic coast , the principal mechanism for regional departures from gmsl during the holocene is gia , which is the ongoing , multi - millennial response of earth s shape and geoid to large - scale changes in surface mass load ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( figure [ fig : map]e ) . growth and thickening of the laurentide ice sheet during the last glaciation caused subsidence of land beneath the ice mass @xcite . a compensating outward flow in the mantle created a peripheral bulge around the ice margin in the u.s .",
    "mid - atlantic region .",
    "in addition to uplifting the solid earth in the u.s .",
    "mid - atlantic region , these flows also increased the regional height of the geoid and reduced the global volume of the ocean basin .",
    "these latter two factors led to a rising sea - surface height in the u.s .",
    "mid - atlantic region and thus a total rsl fall less than the regional uplift @xcite .",
    "as the laurentide ice sheet shrunk , mantle flow back toward the center of the diminishing ice sheet caused subsidence and progressive inward migration of the peripheral forebulge .",
    "one commonly used physical model of gia ( ice-5g - vm2 - 90 ) yields contributions to 20th century sea - level rise of @xmath01.3 mm / yr at new york city and @xmath00.5 mm / yr at wilmington , nc @xcite , but exact values depend upon assumptions regarding ice - sheet history and mantle viscosity .    along much of the u.s .",
    "atlantic coast , the tectonic contribution to rsl change is assumed to be negligible over timescales of centuries to millennia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but parts of the north carolina coastal plain are underlain by the cape fear arch @xcite ( figure [ fig : map]b ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the static - equilibrium ` fingerprint ' contribution to rsl changes arises from the immediate response of earth s geoid , rotation , and elastic lithosphere to redistribution of mass between land ice and the ocean @xcite .",
    "as the mass of an ice sheet or glacier shrinks , sea - level rise is greater in areas geographically distal to the land ice than in areas close to it , primarily because the gravitational attraction between the ice mass and the ocean is reduced .",
    "greenland ice sheet ( gris ) mass loss , for instance , generates a meridional sea - level gradient along the u.s .",

    "atlantic coast ( including north carolina ) , which is about 20% higher than the global average due primarily to the effect of wais mass loss on earth s rotation @xcite .",
    "though the magnitude of sea - level fingerprints proximal to a changing ice mass is sensitive to the internal distribution of that mass , this sensitivity diminishes with distance .",
    "for example , at the distance of north carolina , assumptions about the distribution of mass lost from gris have only an @xmath8 effect on the fingerprint ( i.e. , a rsl effect equal to @xmath9 of the global mean ) @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as observed by satellite altimetry , the dynamic sea - surface height off of new jersey averages @xmath060 cm lower than the height off of bermuda . by contrast , off the north carolina coast , the dynamic sea - surface height averages @xmath10 cm lower than off bermuda , and this difference diminishes much more quickly off shore than it does north of cape hatteras , where the gulf stream separates from the u.s .",
    "atlantic coast and turns toward northern europe @xcite .",
    "ocean modeling shows that a slower gulf stream , which can be caused by a weaker atlantic meridional overturning circulation or by shifting winds , would reduce these sea - level gradients , increasing sea level along the u.s .",
    "atlantic coast north of cape hatteras ( figure [ fig : map]d ) .",
    "a northward shift in the position of the gulf stream , which could result from a migration of the intertropical convergence zone ( itcz ) , would similarly raise mid - atlantic sea levels .",
    "in contrast , sea - surface height in coastal regions south of cape hatteras is less influenced by changes in the gulf stream @xcite .",
    "locally in north carolina , rsl also changes in response to sediment compaction @xcite , groundwater withdrawal @xcite , and tidal - range shifts .",
    "north carolina is partly located within the albemarle embayment ( figure [ fig : map]b ) , a cenozoic depositional basin @xcite stretching from the norfolk arch at the north carolina / virginia border to southern pamlico sound at the cape lookout high .",
    "the embayment is composed of @xmath11 km thick post - rift sedimentary rocks and quaternary unconsolidated sediments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the influence of local factors on regional rsl reconstructions is minimized by using proxy and instrumental data from multiple sites .",

    "both have limitations : southport has temporal gaps in the record , while the wilmington record was influenced by deepening of the navigational channels , which increased the tidal range @xcite .",
