    "the polarization of biological cells has a wide scope of practical applications like manipulation , trapping or separation of biological cells @xcite , and thus an accurate characterization of the polarization is needed . while the polarization of biological cells can be investigated by the method of dielectric spectroscopy @xcite as well as by the measurement of field - induced cell movements @xcite ,",
    "the former method has a much higher resolution @xcite . for biological cells ,",
    "the main contribution to the dielectric dispersion is the structural ( maxwell - wagner ) polarization effects @xcite .",
    "because of the practical applications , there is a strong need for intuitive models as well as simplified equations which describe the parameter dependence of the polarization .",
    "thus , various cell models have been proposed for the analysis of the polarization mechanisms . however , due to the complexity of existing theories , these methods have not yet found broader acceptance .    in this work ,",
    "we propose the use of the spectral representation @xcite for analyzing the cell models .",
    "the spectral representation is a rigorous mathematical formalism of the effective dielectric constant of a two - phase composite material @xcite .",
    "it offers the advantage of the separation of material parameters ( namely the dielectric constant and conductivity ) from the cell structure information , thus simplifying the study . from the spectral representation",
    ", one can readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum , with the dispersion strength as well as the characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in terms of the structure parameters and the materials parameters of the cell suspension ( see section ii.b below ) .",
    "the actual shape of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity over the relaxation region can be uniquely determined by the debye relaxation spectrum , parametrized by the characteristic frequencies and the dispersion strengths .",
    "so , we can study the impact of these parameters on the dispersion spectrum directly .",
    "the plan of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review the spectral representation theory @xcite and show that the dielectric dispersion spectrum of a cell suspension can be expressed in terms of the spectral representation . in section iii",
    ", we will apply the spectral representation to the various cell models and present an alternative approach .",
    "we show that a better agreement with the experimental data can be achieved . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the effects of dipole rotation .",
    "we will show that the dipole rotation effect has a strong impact on the dispersion spectrum when the cells are sufficiently long .",
    "discussion on further applications of our theory will be given .",
    "we regard a cell suspension as a composite system consisting of biological cells of complex dielectric constant @xmath0 dispersed in a host medium of @xmath1 .",
    "a uniform electric field @xmath2 is applied along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "we briefly review the spectral representation theory of the effective dielectric constant to establish notations .",
    "the spectral representation is initiated by solving the differential equation = 0 , where @xmath4 denotes the relevant material parameter and @xmath5 is the characteristic function of the cell structure .",
    "the electric potential @xmath6 can be solved formally @xcite ( * r*)=-e_0 z+d*r*(*r* ) g_0(*r*-*r*)(*r* ) , where @xmath7 is the free space green s function . by denoting an operator = d*r*(*r*)g_0(*r*-*r*) , and the corresponding inner product   - - |ze_0 . from the solution",
    ", we obtain the electric field and hence compute the effective dielectric constant @xmath8 in the spectral representation .",
    "we further define the reduced effective dielectric function @xcite : f()=1-_e _ 2 = -1ve_0 z| . by inserting the complete set @xmath9",
    ", we find f()=1v _",
    "n z|nn|z -s_n = _",
    "n f_n -s_n .",
    "[ fs ] @xmath10 is defined as the spectral function : f_n=1v z|nn|z , which satisfies a sum rule @xcite : _",
    "n z|nn|z= 1v z|z= v_1/v = p , where @xmath11 is the total volume of the suspending cells and @xmath12 the volume fraction of the cells .      for cells of arbitrary shape",
    ", the eigenvalue problem of the @xmath13 operator can only be solved numerically .",
    "however , analytic solutions can be obtained for isolated spherical and ellipsoidal cells . for dilute suspensions of prolate spheroidal cells ,",
    "the cells can be regarded as noninteracting .",
    "the problem is simplified to the calculation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 with a single cell , which can be solved exactly .",
    "only two of the @xmath10 are nonzero , due to the orthogonality of @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in subsequent studies , we restrict ourselves to two poles ( @xmath17 ) . from eq.([fs ] ) , the effective dielectric constant is written in the spectral representation : _",
    "e=_2(1-_n=1 ^ 2 ) .",
    "[ sp ] after substituting @xmath18 and @xmath19 into eq.([sp ] ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant , we rewrite the effective dielectric constant after simple manipulations : _ e=_h + _ n=1 ^ 2 + , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the high - frequency dielectric constant and the low - frequency conductivity respectively , while @xmath24 are the dispersion magnitudes , @xmath25 are the characteristic frequencies of the @xmath26th sub - dispersion .",
    "we obtain the dispersion magnitudes @xmath27 and the characteristic frequencies @xmath28 , respectively @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "to compare with experiment data @xcite , we express the dispersion magnitude ratio and characteristic frequency ratio as @xmath32",
    "in a recent work @xcite , we adopted the spheroidal model ( sm ) to analyze the cell suspensions . here",
    "we briefly review the analytic results of the model : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the depolarization factors along the @xmath3-axis and @xmath35-(or @xmath36- ) axis of the prolate spheroid and @xmath37 is the ratio of length @xmath38 to diameter @xmath39 .    in the spheroidal model , we neglected the presence of a cell membrane . to study this effect",
    ", we put forward the shell - spheroidal model ( ssm ) here . in this case , the biological cells are modelled as shell - spheroidal ones with a spheroidal core of complex dielectric constant @xmath40 , covered with a confocal spheroidal shell of @xmath41 . for a small volume fraction @xmath12 of shelled spheroidal cells embedded in a host medium of complex dielectric constant @xmath42 , the effective dielectric constant @xmath8",
    "is given by the dilute - limit expression : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the dipole factor for a single - shelled spheroidal cell along the @xmath3-axis @xcite : @xmath45   + ( \\t{\\ep}_1-\\t{\\ep}_s)y[\\t{\\ep}_s+l_z(\\t{\\ep}_2-\\t{\\ep}_s ) ] }   { ( \\t{\\ep}_s-\\t{\\ep}_1)(\\t{\\ep}_2-\\t{\\ep}_s)yl_z(1-l_z )   + [ \\t{\\ep}_s+l_z(\\t{\\ep}_1-\\t{\\ep}_s ) ]   [ \\t{\\ep}_2+l_z(\\t{\\ep}_s-\\t{\\ep}_2)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the volume ratio of core to the whole shelled spheroid , while @xmath46 indicates the dipole factor along the @xmath35- ( or @xmath36- ) axis , which can be obtained by replacing the subscript @xmath3 with @xmath47 in the expression of @xmath44 .",
    "as a matter of fact , the cell suspension consisting of shell - spheroidal cells dispersed in a host medium is a three - phase system .",
    "although the spectral representation was generally valid for two - phase composites , we have recently shown that it applies to composites of coated spheres as well as to coated spherical particles randomly embedded in a host medium @xcite .",
    "note the sum rule @xmath48 is no longer valid .",
    "similarly , one can show that the spectral representaton also applies to the present system consisting of spheroidal cells with shells of complex dielectric constant @xmath49 dispersed in a host .",
    "the effective dielectric constant is then given by _",
    "e=_2 with @xmath50 being the nonresonant part which vanishes in the limit of unshelled spheroidal inclusions , where @xmath51 }   { x - l_z(x-1)^2(y-1)+l_z^2(x-1)^2(y-1)},\\nonumber\\\\ s_2&=&\\frac{l_{xy}[1+(x-1)y+l_{xy}(-1+x+y - xy ) ] }   { x - l_{xy}(x-1)^2(y-1)+l_{xy}^2(x-1)^2(y-1)},\\nonumber\\\\ f_1&=&\\frac{p x^2 y}{3[x - l_z(x-1)^2(y-1)+l_z^2(x-1)^2(y-1)]^2 } ,   \\nonumber\\\\ f_2&=&\\frac{2 p x^2 y}{3[x - l_{xy}(x-1)^2(y-1)+l_{xy}^2(x-1)^2(y-1)]^2 } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 .",
    "we omit the complicated expression for the nonresonant part here . in what follows , for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we assume : ( 1 ) @xmath36 is a constant for all coated spheroid ; ( 2 ) @xmath35 is a real number .    in fig.1",
    ", we plot the structure parameters @xmath10 and @xmath14 versus @xmath35 for various @xmath36 and for ( a ) @xmath53 , ( b ) @xmath54 and ( c ) @xmath55 , respectively . in all case , @xmath56 .",
    "we find @xmath10 is strongly dependent on @xmath36 for @xmath57 , whereas it is not the case for @xmath14 .",
    "it may be concluded that the dielectric property of the cell membrane has a minor effect on the dispersion magnitude ratio , but plays no role in the characteristic frequency ratio .    to investigate the validity of these models , we compare to experimental data , which was extracted by using a temperature sensitive cell division cycle mutant of fission yeast , @xmath58-@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "theory @xcite results are also plotted for comparison . from fig.2",
    ", it is evident that our model gives a better comparison with experimental data than asami s theory .",
    "the reason for the improvement lies in the introduction of the conductivity contrast @xmath60 by using of the spectral representation .",
    "as stated in ref.@xcite , the large difference between our model and asami s theory is due to a large @xmath61 used in contrast to asami s claim @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we further find that ssm provides a better fit than sm for the dispersion magnitude ratio @xmath63 , while ssm yields the same results as those of sm for the frequency ratio @xmath64 ( both curves overlap in the right panel of fig.2 ) , indicating that the dielectric property of a cell membrane is indeed unimportant .",
    "according to the numerical results , we find that the ssm provides a better fitting with previous experimental data than sm , but this improvement is actually too small . in other words , the dielectric properties of a cell membrane does not play an important role in dielectric dispersion spectrum .",
    "but , those numerical result will also show that both sm and ssm can not obtain a good agreement with experimental data . in the presence of an electric field",
    ", cells of large length may rotate in favor of the applied field , thus we propose another model , namely the dipole - rotation spheroidal model ( drsm ) to obtain a better fitting .",
    "when the cells are long enough , the rotation of dipole becomes very important with the external electric field under consideration , and the system is in general anisotropic .",
    "we have to take into account the effect of dipole rotation on @xmath65 and @xmath66 , even for a weak electric field .",
    "let us compute them from a thermodynamic consideration .",
    "we will show that they in general depends on @xmath37 .",
    "consider a spheroidal cell in an electric field @xmath67 .",
    "its long axis makes an angle @xmath68 with the field .",
    "the dipole energy of the cell is e_d(q,)=-re , [ dipole ] where @xmath44 and @xmath46 are dipole factors along and perpendicular to the long axis : @xmath69 eq.([dipole ] ) can be understood by the energy approach . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose the major axes of the cells all lie along the electric field , i.e. , @xmath70 , then the induced dipole moments of the cells give a contribution to the effective dielectric constant .",
    "in the dilute limit , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the volume fraction of the cells . for a fixed external field condition ,",
    "the total electrostatic energy density of the suspension is given by @xmath73 , which is equal to @xmath74 , and hence the desired results .",
    "we showed that the conductivity contrast @xmath60 attains a small negative value @xcite and thus the complex material parameter @xmath75 can be approximated by @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , both @xmath44 and @xmath46 have positive values .",
    "the probability is given by the boltzmann factor ( q,)=a e^-e_d(q,)/k_bt where @xmath76 is a normalization factor such that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the solid angle , @xmath79 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath65 and @xmath66 by the following integrals @xmath80the @xmath81 ratio may be obtained by integrating with respect to @xmath68 from @xmath82 to @xmath83 by symmetry . in the absence of an electric field , @xmath84 and @xmath85 equals to a uniform distribution . in which case , we obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and hence @xmath88 . when the electric field is weak enough ,",
    "the ratio is still constant and @xmath88 .",
    "otherwise , the ratio will increase rapidly with @xmath37 . for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath88 always .",
    "the above result implies that both @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend strongly on @xmath37 when there is an electric field . for large @xmath37 , @xmath91",
    ", the spheroids tend to align with the applied field and hence @xmath92 becomes very large .",
    "it is found that the mean cell length depends on the cultivation time , whereas the diameter is almost unchanged in an experiment @xcite , which will be applied to compare the different models . in the following numerical calculation , without loss of generality",
    ", we neglect the small imaginary part of @xmath1 , and define a new parameter @xmath93 : = which characterizes the electric field strength",
    ".    we can readily obtain the dispersion magnitude ratio @xmath63 as well as the dispersion frequency ratio @xmath64 by substituting the results of @xmath81 into eqs.([mag ] ) and ( [ freq ] ) , and setting @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in fig.3",
    ", @xmath92 is plotted versus @xmath37 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath92 depends strongly on the axial ratio @xmath37 , especially for large @xmath37 or strong magnitude of external electric field .    to compare with experimental data in fig.2",
    ", we obtain good agreement in the drsm with @xmath96 , which corresponds to a weak field @xmath97 v / m .",
    "the results show that dipole rotation indeed plays an important role in the dielectric dispersion  we can not neglect the effect of the rotation of dipole induced by the applied electric field , especially when the average length of cell is large .",
    "in addition , good agreement exists only for large cytoplasmic conductivity , as attributed to a higher ion concentration in their cytoplasm to avoid the shrinkage of cells due to a loss of water across the cell membrane .",
    "here we would like to make a few comments . at low frequencies ,",
    "the cell membrane effectively insulates the interior of cell . in other words ,",
    "a potential builds up entirely over the cell membrane , leaving the interior of cell rather inactive to the field @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath98 and @xmath99 and it is reasonable to use @xmath100 as fitting parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the host medium has low loss and @xmath101 and at the same time a large cytoplasmic conductivity @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath102 and it is reasonable to use @xmath103 to fit the data .",
    "the resulting equations [ eqs.([mag ] ) and ( [ freq ] ) ] are indeed simple equations arising from the spectral representation .",
    "these equations serve as a basis which describe the parameter dependence of the polarization and thereby enhances the applicability of various cell models for the analysis of the polarization mechanisms . in this connection , the shell - spheroid model may readily be extended to multi - shell cell model . however",
    ", we believe that the multi - shell nature of the cell may have a minor effect on the dispersion magnitude ratio as well as on the characteristic frequency ratio .    in the presence of external electric fields , field - induced motions such as rotation of cells , dielectrophoretic motion or vibrational motion may have a significant impact on the dielectric dispersion spectrum .",
    "with the recent advent of experimental techniques such as automated video analysis @xcite as well as light scattering methods@xcite , the cell movements can be accurately monitored . for purely rotational motions ,",
    "the distribution of surface charge on the cell surfaces may deviate significantly from the equilibrium distribution for cells at rest , leading to a change in the polarization relaxation and in the dielectric dispersion spectrum . in this regard ,",
    "our recent work on dynamic electrorheological effects @xcite , in which the suspended particles can have rotational motions , may be applied to cell rotational motions . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we found that the particles rotational motions do change the polarization relaxation substantially .",
    "in this work , we considered a monodisperse cell suspension , in which the cells are of the same shape ( i.e. , same length and diameter ) . while the diameter of the cells may remain constant during the cultivation process , the cells may possess a wide distribution of cell lengths @xcite . a modified theory , which takes the distribution of length into account , is urgently needed and our spectral representation theory will certainly help . in this connection",
    ", we may apply a strong dc electric field ( in addition to the ac probe field ) to help separating the long cells from the short ones .",
    "our results indicate that even in a moderate field , the long cells can easily be aligned with the applied field , while the short ones remain essentially randomly oriented . in this way",
    ", an emphasis of dispersion spectrum of the long cells can be made possible .    in summary , prompted by the discrepancy between recent theory and experiment on fission yeast cells ,",
    "we have proposed the use of spectral representation to analyze more realistic cell models .",
    "we adopted a shell - spheroidal model to analyze the effects of the cell membrane .",
    "it is found that the presence of a membrane has only a minor effect on the dispersion ratio , but plays no role in the frequency ratio .",
    "we further included the effect of rotation of dipole induced by an external electric field .",
    "it has been found that the dipole - rotation effect plays an important role in the dispersion magnitude , but it does not change the characteristic frequency ratio .",
