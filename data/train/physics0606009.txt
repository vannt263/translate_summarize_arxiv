    "in part 1 we have shown that from the principle of relativity alone , we can infer that there are only two possibilities for space time transformations between inertial systems : the galilean transformations or the lorentz transformations . in special relativity",
    "we use the lorentz transformation and obtain interval conservation .",
    "we also show that the set of all relativistically allowed velocities is a ball @xmath0 of radius @xmath1-the speed of light .",
    "we have shown that similar results hold for proper - velocity - time transformations between accelerated systems .",
    "if an object moves in an inertial system @xmath2 with uniform velocity @xmath3 and @xmath2 moves parallel to @xmath4 with relative velocity @xmath5 , then in system @xmath4 the object has uniform velocity @xmath6 , the relativistic sum of @xmath5 and @xmath7 defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the component of @xmath3 parallel to @xmath5 , @xmath10 denotes the component of @xmath3 perpendicular to @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is the well - known einstein velocity addition formula .",
    "note that the velocity addition is _ commutative only _ for parallel velocities .",
    "the lorentz transformation preserves the velocity ball @xmath12 and acts on it by @xmath13 it can be shown @xcite that the map @xmath14 is a projective ( preserving line segments ) automorphism of @xmath12 .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the group of all projective automorphisms of the domain @xmath12 .",
    "the map @xmath14 belongs to @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be any projective automorphism of @xmath12 .",
    "set @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 is an isometry and represented by an orthogonal matrix .",
    "thus , the group @xmath15 of all projective automorphisms has the characterization @xmath20 this group represents the velocity transformation between two arbitrary inertial systems and provides a representation of the lorentz group .",
    "now we are going to adapt newton s classical dynamics law @xmath21 to special relativity . by definition ,",
    "a force generates a change of velocity . since in special relativity",
    "the velocity must remain in @xmath12 , the changes caused by the force can not take the velocity out of @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that on the boundary of the domain @xmath12 , the changes caused by the force can not have a non - zero component normal to the boundary of the domain and facing outward .",
    "one of the common ways to solve this problem is to assume that the mass @xmath22 approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the boundary of @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the mass of an object to be an intrinsic characteristic of the object .",
    "we therefore keep the mass constant and equal to the so - called rest - mass @xmath23 . under such an assumption we must give up the property that the force on an object is independent of the velocity of the object , since such a force would take the velocity out of @xmath12 .",
    "note that also in non - relativistic mechanics we have forces which depend on the velocity , like friction and the magnetic force .    to derive the relativistic dynamics equation",
    ", we must introduce a new axiom which will allow us to derive such an equation . for alternative axioms used by others , see rindler @xcite , p.109 . based on this new axiom",
    ", we will derive a relativistic dynamics equation .",
    "our equation agrees with the known relativistic dynamics equation obtained by different assumptions",
    ". the difference will be only in the interpretation and the derivation of the equation .",
    "we base our additional axiom for relativistic dynamics on einstein s equivalence principle . in the context of flat space - time ,",
    "the _ principle of equivalence _ states that  the laws of physics have the same form in a uniformly accelerated system as they have in an unaccelerated inertial system in a uniform gravitational field .",
    "\" this means that the evolution of an object in an inertial system @xmath4 under a uniform gravitational field or gravitational force is the same as the free motion of the object in the system @xmath2 moving with uniform acceleration with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the relative velocity of the system @xmath2 with respect to @xmath4 caused by this uniform acceleration by @xmath25 and assume that @xmath26 . since in the system @xmath2 the motion of the object is free , its velocity @xmath27 there is constant and is equal to its initial velocity @xmath28 . by ( [ boostvelball ] ) ,",
    "the velocity of the object in system @xmath4 is @xmath29 in particular , @xmath25 is the velocity at time @xmath30 of an object moving under the force of our gravitational field which was at rest at @xmath31 .    from this observation , we see that the principle of equivalence provides a connection between the action of a force on an object with zero initial condition and its action on an object with nonzero initial condition .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ forceonvelball ] ) implies that a uniform gravitational force in special relativity defines an evolution on the velocity ball @xmath12 which is given by a differentiable curve @xmath32 with @xmath33-the identity of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , from the definition of the lie algebra @xmath34 as generators of such curves , we conclude that the action of a uniform gravitational field on the velocity ball @xmath12 is given by an element of the lie algebra @xmath34 .",
    "we _ extend _ the equivalence principle to a form which will make it valid for _ any _ force , not only gravity and call this the  extended partial equivalence principle \" - @xmath24 for short .",
    "the statement of this principle is : _ the evolution of an object in an inertial system under a uniform force is the same as a free evolution of the same ( or similar ) object in a uniformly accelerated system .",
    "_ since the action of the gravitational force on an object is independent of the object s properties , the @xmath24 for the gravitational force holds for _ any _ object , not only for the same one .    according to the above argument , formula ( [ forceonvelball ] )",
    "will hold for any force satisfying @xmath24 , not only the gravity satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the velocity of an object under a uniform force satisfying @xmath24 in relativistic dynamics is @xmath36 where @xmath25 is the velocity evolution of a similar object with zero initial velocity and @xmath37 is the initial velocity of the object .",
    "it can be shown that the solution of the usual relativistic dynamics equation satisfies this property . also , as above",
    ", the action of any uniform force ( on given objects ) on the velocity ball @xmath12 is given by an element of the lie algebra @xmath34 .",
    "note that forces satisfying the @xmath24 do not generate rotations and thus are represented by a subset of @xmath34 which is not a lie algebra .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a lorentz invariant relativistic dynamic equation we must assume that a force can be represented by an arbitrary element of the lie algebra @xmath34 .",
    "this will allow the force to have a rotational component as well . in the next section",
    ", we derive the relativistic dynamic equation for forces satisfying @xmath24 implying that they are elements of @xmath34 .",
    "to define the elements of @xmath34 , consider differentiable curves @xmath38 from a neighborhood @xmath39 of @xmath40 into @xmath15 , with @xmath41 , the identity of @xmath15 . according to ( [ autd0 ] ) , any such @xmath42 has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a differentiable function satisfying @xmath45 and @xmath46 is differentiable and satisfies @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the element of @xmath34 generated by @xmath42 . by direct calculation ( see @xcite , p.35 ) , we get @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a @xmath52 skew - symmetric matrix @xmath53 . defining @xmath54",
    ", we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the vector product in @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the lie algebra @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the vector field defined by @xmath60    note that any @xmath61 is a polynomial in @xmath62 of degree less than or equal to 2 .",
    "this is a general property of the lie algebra of the automorphism group of a bounded symmetric domain , see @xcite .",
    "the ball @xmath12 is a bounded symmetric domain with the automorphism group @xmath15 of projective maps and @xmath63 is its lie algebra .",
    "it is known that the elements of the lie algebra of a bounded symmetric domain are uniquely described by a triple product , called the @xmath64 triple product .",
    "the elements of @xmath63 transform between two inertial systems in the same way as the transformation of the electromagnetic field strength .    under our assumption ,",
    "the force is an element of @xmath65 thus , the equation of evolution of a charged particle with charge @xmath66 and _ rest - mass _ @xmath23 using the generator @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 or @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the proper time of the particle .",
    "note that the last ( quadratic ) term in ( [ relevolution ] ) keeps the velocity inside the ball and we do not need to introduce varying mass .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this formula coincides with the well - known formula @xmath71    thus , the flow generated by an electromagnetic field is defined by elements of the lie algebra @xmath34 , which are , in turn , vector field polynomials in @xmath62 of degree 2 .",
    "the linear term of this field comes from the magnetic force , while the constant and the quadratic terms come from the electric field .",
    "if the electromagnetic field @xmath72 is constant , then for any given @xmath70 , the solution of ( [ relevolution ] ) is an element @xmath73 and the set of such elements form a one - parameter subgroup of @xmath74 .",
    "this subgroup is a geodesic of the metric invariant under the group .    if we set @xmath75 and denote @xmath76 we obtain the dynamics equation of evolution in relativistic _",
    "mechanics_. thus , also in relativistic mechanics the force is defined by an element of @xmath34 .",
    "if the electromagnetic field is not uniform , it is defined by @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are dependent on space and time . in this case , the action of the field is on a fibre - bundle with minkowski space - time as base and @xmath12 as the fibre .",
    "the field acts on the fibre over the point @xmath79 as @xmath80 defined by ( [ deltaeb ] ) .",
    "explicit solution of the evolution equation ( [ relevolution ] ) exists only for constant electric @xmath81 or constant magnetic @xmath82 fields .",
    "if both fields are present , even in the case where there is an invariant plane and the problem can be reduced to one complex variable , there are no direct explicit solutions .",
    "the reason for this is that equation ( [ relevolution ] ) is not complex analytic .",
    "complex analyticity is connected with conformal maps , while the transformations on the velocity ball are projective .",
    "all currently known explicit solutions @xcite,@xcite and @xcite use some substitutions such that in the new variable the transformations become conformal .    to obtain explicit solutions for motion of a charge in constant , uniform , and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields , we associate with any velocity @xmath62 a new dynamic variable called the _ symmetric velocity _ @xmath83 .",
    "the symmetric velocity @xmath83 and its corresponding velocity @xmath62 are related by @xmath84 the physical meaning of this velocity is explained in figure [ svelmeaning2 ] .    instead of @xmath83",
    ", we shall find it more convenient to use the unit - free vector @xmath85 , which we call the _ s - velocity_. the relation of a velocity @xmath62 to its corresponding s - velocity is @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the function mapping the s - velocity @xmath88 to its corresponding velocity @xmath62 .",
    "the s - velocity has some interesting and useful mathematical properties .",
    "the set of all three - dimensional relativistically admissible s - velocities forms a unit ball @xmath89    corresponding to the einstein velocity addition equation , we may define an addition of s - velocities in @xmath90 such that @xmath91 a straightforward calculation leads to the corresponding equation for s - velocity addition : @xmath92    equation ( [ symveladdition ] ) can be put into a more convenient form if , for any @xmath93 , we define a map @xmath94 by @xmath95 this map is an extension to @xmath96 of the mbius addition on the complex unit disc .",
    "it defines a _ conformal _ map on @xmath90 .",
    "the motion of a charge in @xmath97 fields is two - dimensional if the charge starts in the plane perpendicular to @xmath82 , and in this case eq.([symveladdition ] ) for s - velocity addition is somewhat simpler . by introducing a complex structure on the plane @xmath98 , which is perpendicular to @xmath82 ,",
    "the disk @xmath99 can be identified as a unit disc @xmath100 called the poincar disc . in this case",
    "the s - velocity addition defined by eq.([symveladdition ] ) becomes @xmath101 which is the well - known mbius transformation of the unit disk .    by using the @xmath102 velocity we can rewrite ( as in @xcite ) the relativistic lorentz force equation @xmath103 as @xmath104 which is the relativistic lorentz force equation for the s - velocity @xmath88 as a function of the proper time @xmath70 .",
    "we now use eq.([eb18 ] ) to find the s - velocity of a charge @xmath66 in uniform , constant , and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields . since all of the terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eb18 ] ) are in the plane perpendicular to @xmath105 , if @xmath88 is in the plane @xmath98 perpendicular to @xmath105 , then @xmath106 is also in @xmath98 . consequently , if the initial s - velocity is in the plane perpendicular to @xmath105 , @xmath107 will remain in the this plane and the motion will be two dimensional .",
    "working in cartesian coordinates , we choose @xmath108 by introducing a complex structure in @xmath98 by denoting @xmath109 the evolution equation eq.([eb18 ] ) get the following simple form : @xmath110 where @xmath111 the solution of eq.([ebmain ] ) is unique for a given initial condition @xmath112 where the complex number @xmath113 represents the initial s - velocity @xmath114 of the charge .    integrating eq.([ebmain ] ) produces the equation @xmath115 where the constant @xmath116 is determined from the initial condition ( [ initialconditioneb ] ) .",
    "the way we evaluate this integral depends upon the sign of the discriminant @xmath117 associated with the denominator of the integrand .",
    "if we define @xmath118 then the three cases @xmath119 correspond to the cases @xmath120 greater than zero , equal to zero , and less than zero .",
    "* case 1 * consider first the case @xmath121 the denominator of the integrand in ( [ inteb2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the real , positive roots @xmath125 and the solution then becomes : @xmath126 with @xmath127 this equation shows that in a system k moving with s - velocity @xmath123 relative to the lab , the s - velocity of the charge corresponds to circular motion with initial s - velocity @xmath128 the s - velocity observed in k is shown in figure [ wtaucase3 ] .    from eqs.([velandsvel ] ) and ( [ ebroots ] ) it follows that the velocity corresponding to s - velocity @xmath123 is @xmath129 which is the well - known @xmath130 drift velocity . applying the map @xmath87 defined in eq.([einsteinaddsymaddition ] ) to both sides of ( [ solevoleqncase3 ] ) , we get @xmath131 eq.([solevoleqncase3a ] ) says that the total velocity of the charge , as a function of the proper time , is the sum of a constant drift velocity @xmath132 and circular motion , as expected .",
    "if we let @xmath133 then the velocity of the charge is @xmath134 the position of the charge as a function of the proper time is @xmath135 and the lab time @xmath30 as a function of the proper time is @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",

    "* case 2 * next consider the case @xmath139 .",

    "the space trajectories @xmath147 of the test particles is given on of figure [ spacetrcase2 ]    * case 3 * consider the case @xmath148 .    just as in case 1 , we rewrite the denominator of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ inteb2 ] ) as @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 by introducing @xmath152 as in ( [ nu ] ) and an s - velocity @xmath153 we can write the solution as : @xmath154 this s - velocity is graphed in figure [ wtaucase1 ]    for the velocity of the charge we get @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the drift velocity and @xmath157 is the initial velocity in the drift frame . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath158 and the lab time @xmath30 as a function of the proper time is @xmath159 equations ( [ finalr32 ] ) and ( [ finalt3 ] ) together give the complete solution for this case .",
    "the space trajectory is given in figure [ spacetrcase1 ] .",
    "in this section we will use four - velocity instead of velocity to describe the relativistic evolution .    to define the four velocity , we consider the lorentz space - time transformation between two inertial systems @xmath2 and @xmath4 with axes chosen to be parallel .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 moves with respect to @xmath4 with relative velocity @xmath5 . in order for all the coordinates to have the same units",
    ", we describe an event in @xmath2 by @xmath160 and by @xmath161 in @xmath4 .",
    "the lorentz transformation can be now written as in formula ( 19 ) of part 1 as @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "consider now the space - time evolution of the origin @xmath164 of system @xmath2 .",
    "this origin has space coordinate @xmath165 and thus by ( [ lorentzkk ] ) its evolution in @xmath4 is given by @xmath166 this shows that @xmath164 moves with uniform proper velocity @xmath167 in @xmath4 , which is called the _ four - velocity _ corresponding to @xmath5 , which we will denote by @xmath168 .",
    "in other words @xmath169 which is a four - dimensional vector .",
    "the four - velocity expresses not only the change of the position of an object but also the change of the time rate of the clock comoving with the object .    here",
    "too , we will assume the @xmath24 principle , which implies that the acceleration of an object under a given force in an inertial system @xmath4 is equivalent to free motion in system @xmath2 moving with a variable relative velocity @xmath25 with respect to @xmath4 . also here",
    "we may assume that @xmath170 denote the initial velocity of the object in @xmath2 by @xmath62 .",
    "since the motion of the object in system @xmath2 is free , the velocity of the object will remain constant in @xmath2 .",
    "the four - velocity @xmath171 will also remain constant .",
    "we denote the proper time of the object by @xmath70 . by use of ( [ lorentzkk ] ) and ( [ four velocitytrace ] ) and the well - known formulas ( see @xcite ) for relativistic velocity addition and the transformation of the corresponding @xmath172 s",
    ", we can calculate the world - line of the the object in @xmath4 as @xmath173 @xmath174@xmath175 @xmath176 this shows that @xmath177 and that the four velocity transformation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 is given by multiplication by the @xmath178 matrix of @xmath179 .    as a result ,",
    "the relativistic acceleration , which is the generator of the four - velocity changes , is obtained by differentiating the matrix of @xmath180 with respect to @xmath30 at @xmath31 . since @xmath26 ,",
    "we have @xmath181 and @xmath182 , denoting @xmath183 we get the matrix for _ relativistic acceleration _ @xmath184 using the fact that for small velocities @xmath185 , by newton s dynamic law , the four - velocity and relativistic acceleration in special relativity become : @xmath186 the last expression is called the _ four - force _ , see @xcite p. 123 .",
    "general four - velocity transformations between two inertial systems also include rotations , which can be expressed by a @xmath52 orthogonal matrices @xmath187 .",
    "we will extend such a matrix to a @xmath178 matrix by adding zeros in the time components outside the diagonal and assume that @xmath188 .",
    "the general four - velocity transformation will then be @xmath189 and its generator , representing _ relativistic acceleration _",
    ", is @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a @xmath52 antisymmetric matrix .",
    "we have seen that relativistic acceleration includes both linear and rotational acceleration and is a linear map on the four - velocities .",
    "the matrix representing the relativistic acceleration is antisymmetric if both indices are space indices or both are time indices and is symmetric if one of the indices is spacial and the other is a temporal .",
    "moreover , any _ relativistic force _ , which is a multiple of the relativistic acceleration by @xmath23 , must have the form of the electromagnetic tensor @xmath192 and must transform from one inertial system to another in the same way that this tensor transforms .",
    "the electromagnetic dynamic equation in our notation is @xmath193    in classical mechanics , a force was represented by a differential one - form which expressed the change of the velocity and space displacement of the object in the direction of the force . in special relativity ,",
    "a force ( a non - rotating one ) causes more change then it causes in classical mechanics .",
    "it also causes a change in the rate of a clock connected to the object due to the change of the magnitude of the object s velocity .",
    "thus , it has to be represented by a differential two - form .",
    "on the other hand , forces causing rotation , like the magnetic force need to be described by differential two - forms also in classical mechanics .",
    "thus , only in relativistic dynamics can these two forces be combined effectively as a single force .",
    "we have shown that an analog of the equivalence principle leads to the known relativistic dynamic equation .",
    "the relativistic force is defined by an element of the lie algebra of the group @xmath194 of projective automorphisms of the ball of relativistically admissible velocities @xmath12 .",
    "this lie algebra is a quadratic polynomial on @xmath12 where the constant and quadratic coefficients define an analog of electric force , while the linear term corresponds to a magnetic force .",

    "this explains the known fact that the maxwell equations ( related to electro - magnetic propagation with the speed of light ) are invariant under the conformal group .",
