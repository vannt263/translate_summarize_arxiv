    "the @xmath1 system has been the subject of much attention and recent papers converge to having bindings of about 20 mev and large widths of about 80 mev @xcite .",
    "a fraction of about 30 mev of the width of the state of comes from absorption of the @xmath2 on the pair of nucleons , recently evaluated with precision in @xcite .",
    "the large width can be intuitively understood since the @xmath3 merges into a @xmath4 that has a width of about 30 mev , but since the @xmath4 can be formed with either nucleon , the width can be estimated of the order of 60 mev , to which the absorption @xcite must be added .",
    "it is no wonder that with a width much larger than the binding such state has not been found in spite of searches and claims ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the fate of the analogous @xmath0 system could be quite different .",
    "indeed , the analogous resonance , according to studies of the @xmath5 interaction with coupled channels @xcite , is the @xmath6 , which has a width of 2.6 mev @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the binding of the @xmath5 system , that by analogy to the @xmath7 goes as the relativistic energy of the @xmath8 , should also be bigger than in the case of the @xmath7 system . as a consequence",
    "we are led to have a state more bound and with a smaller width , which could be easily observable . in the study done in @xcite this is what is observed looking into the problem from two perspectives : one is using the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations and the other one using a variational calculation .",
    "both methods converge into a common answer providing a state around 3500 mev with a width of about 30 - 40 mev counting the absorption of the @xmath8 by two nucleons .",
    "in this approach we consider that the two nucleons form a cluster and that the @xmath8 scatters with these nucleons without changing them from their ground state .",
    "this is fair when one has a bound d , which has no energy to excite the @xmath9 system . under this assumption one",
    "has a set of coupled equations involving partition functions which for the @xmath10 system sum the diagrams that we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpp22 ] .",

    "a set of similar , but easier equations , are obtained for scattering of the @xmath0 in isospin @xmath16 such that the proper @xmath17 amplitude where the bound @xmath0 state appears is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the isospin @xmath20 @xmath5 amplitudes and @xmath21 is the @xmath8 propagator folded by the @xmath9 form factor .",
    "@xmath22    the absorption of the @xmath8 by two nucleons is based on the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fcafignew ] , and they are included in a nonperturbative way where the elementary @xmath5 amplitudes are already modified to account by the possibility of the @xmath8 being absorbed by a second nucleon .    the modulus squared amplitude for the @xmath0 amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redtmats0 ] .",
    "we can see a clear peak around 3500 mev with a width of about 20 - 30 mev , which indicates the appearance of a state of the @xmath0 system .",
    "here we calculate the energy of the @xmath0 system with a variational approach formulated for the @xmath23 system in refs .  @xcite . as in the case of the fca",
    ", we consider the @xmath0 system with total isospin @xmath17 and the total spin - parity @xmath24 .",
    "the trial wave function for the state is prepared with two components : @xmath25 ,      \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a normalization constant and @xmath27 is a mixing coefficient . in the main component @xmath28 , two nucleons are combined into spin @xmath29 and isospin @xmath30 so all the two - body subsystems can be in @xmath31 wave .",
    "we also allow a mixture of the @xmath32 component where both spin and isospin are set to be zero , so the orbital angular momentum between two nucleons is odd .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian in this study : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total kinetic energy , @xmath35 is the @xmath5 potential term which is the sum of the contributions from two nucleons , and @xmath36 is the energy of the center - of - mass motion . for the @xmath9 potential @xmath37",
    ", we use three models : hn1r which is constructed from hasegawa - nagata no.1 potential  @xcite , the minnesota force  @xcite , and the gaussian - fitted version of the argonne v18 potential  @xcite .     and @xmath38 including absorption with reduced @xmath9 radius.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the @xmath5 potential in this approach is obtained by studying the @xmath5 scattering in the coupled channels of @xcite and eliminating all except for the @xmath5 one with an effective potential such as to obtain the same scattering amplitude as with the coupled channels @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we consider seven ( eight ) coupled channels in the isospin @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) sector , @xmath5 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ( @xmath5 , @xmath47 , @xmath41 , @xmath48 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) .",
    ".results of the energy compositions in the variational calculation for the ground state of the @xmath0 system with total isospin @xmath17 ( range parameter @xmath51 fm ) .",
    "terms `` bound '' and `` unbound '' are defined with respect to the @xmath52 threshold .",
    "all the numbers are given in mev . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : energy ]    in table  [ tab : energy ] we show some of the properties of the state found for different @xmath9 potentials .",
    "as seen in the table , the @xmath0 system in the @xmath38 channel is bound below the @xmath52 threshold ( @xmath53 mev ) for all the @xmath9 potentials employed .",
    "a large kinetic energy of the deeply bound system is overcome by the strong attraction of the @xmath5 potential , while the @xmath9 potential adds a small correction .",
    "comparing the results with three different nuclear forces , we find that the binding energy is smaller when the @xmath9 potential has a harder repulsive core .    although we will not discuss it here , we also find in @xcite a state with @xmath54 but less bound and more uncertain than the @xmath38 that we have exposed .",
    "as a suggestion to observe experimentally this state we can think of the @xmath55 $ ] reaction , which could be done by fair at gsi . with a @xmath56 beam of @xmath57",
    "there is plenty of energy available for this reaction and the momentum mismatch of the @xmath58 with the spectator nucleons of the @xmath59he can be relatively small .",
    "estimations made in @xcite indicate that one would expect several thousand events per day for the background of the proposed reaction .",
    "a narrow peak could be visible on top of this background corresponding to the @xmath0 bound state formation .",
    "another possibility is the high - energy @xmath60 induced reaction .",
    "an analogous reaction is @xmath61 $ ] where the relevant elementary process is @xmath62 . since the @xmath5 pair in the @xmath0 system is strongly clustering as the @xmath63 , the reaction @xmath64 $ ] is also another candidate .",
    "the elementary reaction @xmath65 is relevant in this case .",
    "such reactions may be realized in the high - momentum beamline project at j - parc .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 system with @xmath17 using two independent methods : the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations and a variational method , and have found that the system is bound and rather stable , with a width of about 20 - 40 mev .",
    "we obtained a clear signal of the quasi - bound state for the total spin @xmath38 channel around 3500 mev .",
    "the small width of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state is advantageous for the experimental identification .",
    "the search for the @xmath0 quasi - bound state can be done by @xmath56 induced reaction at fair , @xmath66 induced reaction at j - parc , and relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
