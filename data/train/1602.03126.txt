    "in a low collisionality plasma , differences in pressure along ( @xmath11 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath2 ) to the local magnetic field @xmath1 are produced by compression , shearing , and/or heating of the plasma .",
    "this is a consequence of the adiabatic invariance of the ` bounce invariant ' and the magnetic moment , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the velocity perpendicular to the local magnetic field , @xmath14 and @xmath4 denotes the particle species @xcite .",
    "thus , absent coulomb collisions , magnetic field amplification and/or plasma compression generically drive @xmath0 , while a decrease in the magnetic field strength and/or plasma expansion generically drives @xmath15 .",
    "these pressure anisotropies can be dynamically important because they modify the effective magnetic tension in the plasma , produce an effective viscosity , and can drive velocity - space instabilities .",
    "systems where @xmath16 is believed to be important are low - luminosity accretion flows around compact objects @xcite , the intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite , and the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "when @xmath17 , the electron whistler instability is excited and can limit the amount of electron pressure anisotropy that develops @xcite .",
    "although the linear behavior of the whistler instability is well understood , the long term , nonlinear evolution of the instability is less clear . indeed , in many astrophysically relevant cases",
    ", the generation of pressure anisotropy occurs over time scales longer than the initial exponential growth phase that characterizes velocity - space instabilities .",
    "moreover , the ions are expected to develop their own pressure anisotropy in synch with the electrons , giving rise to analogous instabilities .",
    "for example , when @xmath18 grows , the mirror and ion - cyclotron ( ic ) instabilities regulate the ion pressure anisotropy @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( using hybrid pic ) and @xcite ( using full pic with ion to electron mass ratios @xmath19 ) studied the saturation of velocity - space instabilities in a model problem where background velocity shear amplifies / reduces the strength of a background magnetic field , thus continually driving pressure anisotropy . @xcite and",
    "@xcite used an expanding / compressing box to accomplish the same goal of continually driving pressure anisotropy .",
    "continuous driving of the pressure anisotropy is important because it allows one to study the nonlinear saturation of velocity - space instabilities , in contrast to more standard initial value calculations .",
    "one of the conclusions of these works is that the mirror instability reaches nonlinear amplitudes with @xmath20 , independent of how slowly the magnetic field is amplified relative to the ion - cyclotron period ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for the volume average of a quantity ) .",
    "a natural question is what effect these large amplitude mirrors have on the electron physics and how the whistler instability grows in the presence of large amplitude mirror modes . in this paper",
    "we use particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to study the combined effect of mirror and whistler instabilities on the electron pressure anisotropy .",
    "this work is thus an extension of our previous study of the ion - scale , kinetic instabilities @xcite . in order",
    "to properly separate phenomena occurring on the ion- and electron - lengthscales , in this work we use larger values of the ion to electron mass ratio : @xmath24 64 and 128 .",
    "we focus throughout this paper on a fiducial case with initial @xmath25 ( in our simulations , @xmath26 decreases in time as the background magnetic field is amplified ) . at sufficiently low @xmath27",
    ", the ion - cyclotron instability is expected to be more important than the mirror instability in regulating the ion pressure anisotropy .",
    "however , @xcite did not find any significant differences in the nonlinear mirror evolution for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and even at @xmath30 the ion - cyclotron instability was sub - dominant .",
    "moreover , @xcite found similar results at higher @xmath31 .",
    "thus we believe that the calculations presented in this paper with @xmath28 provide a good model for the saturation of electron velocity - space instabilities in @xmath32 plasmas ( at least for similar ion and electron temperatures , @xmath33 ; see  [ sec : conclu ] ) .",
    "our work has two important applications .",
    "first , the nonlinear evolution of the mirror and whistler instabilities effectively sets the pitch - angle scattering rate ( and thus the mean free path ) of electrons in low collisionality plasmas .",
    "this in turn determines the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the plasma . in our calculations",
    "we will directly measure the electron mean free path @xmath34 in the collisionless regime , and infer its physical dependence on the plasma parameters .",
    "secondly , electron pressure anisotropy generates an  anisotropic viscosity \" that can contribute to the heating of electrons in accretion disks and other low collisionality plasmas @xcite .",
    "we will see that the magnitude of this heating depends on the magnitude of the electron pressure anisotropy produced by the combined effect of the whistler and mirror instabilities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : numsetup ] we describe the numerical set up of our runs , and our simulation strategy . in  [ sec : interplay ] we determine the saturated pressure anisotropy @xmath35 for the electrons and quantify the electron heating due to anisotropic viscosity . in  [ sec : conduct ] we measure the mean free path of electrons and ions , and determine their dependence on the physical parameters of the plasma . in  [ sec : conclu ] we summarize our results and discuss their implications for galaxy clusters and low - collisionality black hole accretion flows .",
    "we use the electromagnetic , relativistic pic code tristan - mp @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "the simulation box consists of a square box in the @xmath36 plane , containing plasma with a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath37 initially pointing along the @xmath38 axis .",
    "since we want to simulate a magnetic field that is being amplified in an incompressible way , we impose a velocity shear so that the mean particle velocity is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a shear parameter with units of frequency and @xmath41 is the distance along @xmath38 . from flux conservation , the @xmath42-component of the mean field evolves as @xmath43 .",
    "this implies a net growth of @xmath44 , which in turn drives @xmath0 during the whole simulation .",
    "simulations resolving the @xmath36 plane can capture mirror and whistler modes with wave vectors @xmath45 forming any angle with the mean magnetic field @xmath46 . in our previous study , focused on the interplay between the mirror and ic instabilities only @xcite , we found that most of the physics of the relevant instabilities is captured when the @xmath36 plane is resolved ( as in the simulations in this paper ) .",
    "the key parameters in our simulations are the particles magnetization , quantified by the ratio between the initial cyclotron frequency of each species and the shear rate of the plasma , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and the ion to electron mass ratio , @xmath49 . in typical astrophysical environments , @xmath50 .",
    "due to computational constraints , we will use values of @xmath51 , but still much smaller than expected in real astrophysical settings .",
    "because of this , we have made sure to reach the regime where both @xmath49 and @xmath47 are large enough so that their values do not qualitatively affect any of our conclusions .",
    "our simulations have initial @xmath52 . in all of our runs @xmath53 , which implies @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the boltzmann s constant , the electron temperature , and the electron plasma frequency ) .",
    "thus the varying physical parameters in our simulations will be : @xmath58 and @xmath49 ( which uniquely fix @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "some of our simulations use  infinite mass ions \" ( the ions are technically immobile , so they just provide a neutralizing charge ) , with the goal of focusing on the electron - scale physics .",
    "these provide a useful contrast with our finite @xmath49 runs and allow us to isolate the impact of ion physics on the electrons",

    "we ran a series of simulations ensuring that the numerical parameters ( e.g. , different n@xmath61 ) do not significantly affect our results .",

    "thus the whistler thresholds in figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] and subsequent figures are the non - relativistic thresholds multiplied by @xmath91 . ]",
    "we see that in both cases there is a reasonably good agreement between the electron anisotropy obtained from the simulation ( using @xmath72 ) and the theoretical whistler instability thresholds .",
    "this shows that the electron anisotropy is maintained at roughly the marginal stability level for the whistler modes with @xmath95 .",
    "note that in a realistic astrophysical or heliospherical environment , @xmath58 is likely to be larger than in the simulations shown in figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] .",
    "this would lead to somewhat lower saturated @xmath8 ( see  [ sec : whistlerandmirror ] ) .",
    "the pressure anisotropy evolution in figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] is very similar for @xmath83 and @xmath71 .",
    "the primary difference in these two runs is in the amplitude of @xmath70 .",

    "thus , if @xmath86 grows with time ( as occurs here ; see figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] ) , @xmath101 should decrease , reinforcing the need for @xmath107 to decrease as time goes on . ]    we define two magnetic moments to aid in interpreting the numerical results : @xmath108 @xmath109 is the true volume averaged magnetic moment . in @xcite",

    "we see that for the two simulations , @xmath113 decreases on the same time scale ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath113 and @xmath79 are essentially indistinguishable in figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] means that @xmath115 does not fluctuate significantly in space .",

    "this is consistent with an initial  free streaming \" of the electrons ( in which @xmath173 ) , followed by a sudden decrease in the mean free path due to the strong scattering at the end of the exponential whistler growth phase ( where a transient anisotropy  overshoot \" occurs , leading to an overshoot in the mean free path ; see figures [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000]c and [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000]d , corresponding to the same runs ow2 and ow1 ) . by @xmath174 ,",
    "the whistler modes have reached the fully saturated regime , and @xmath175 .",
    "after that , @xmath159 grows with time , increasing by a factor of @xmath176 by the end of the simulation .",
    "the numerically determined evolution of @xmath34 can be understood by considering the expected evolution of @xmath115 and @xmath177 for the case of an incompressible fluid , with homogeneous @xmath115 and @xmath178 , and without a heat flux along @xmath99 @xcite : @xmath179 and @xmath180 for the @xmath181 cases of interest here , @xmath182 , so that @xmath183 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath184 ( @xmath185 in our case ) , one gets that @xmath186 .",
    "equation [ eq:1 ] then implies @xmath187 , or equivalently , @xmath168 .",
    "the saturated values of @xmath188 for the simulations with fixed ions ( figure [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000 ] ) should thus correspond to @xmath189 @xmath171 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the numerically determined values in figure [ fig : mfpmime2000 ] .",
    "the modest increase in the electron mean free path at late times is consistent with the increase in @xmath8 at late times .",
    "both are due to the decreasing @xmath190 ( increasing b ) , which increases the threshold pressure anisotropy for the whistler instability .    figure [ fig : mfpwces2500 ] shows our calculations of the electron and ion mean free paths for simulations with @xmath120 and @xmath191 ( runs mw1 and mw2 , respectively ) .",
    "relatively independent of the mass ratio , the net effect of the mirror modes is to reduce the electron mean free path by a factor @xmath134 relative to the whistler - only results in figure [ fig : mfpmime2000 ] . since the mirror modes also reduce @xmath8 by a factor of @xmath9 , the result @xmath168 derived from equations [ eq:1 ] & [ eq:2 ] continues to describe the behavior of @xmath34 when mirror modes are present .",
    "figure [ fig : mfpwces2500 ] also shows the inferred ion mean free path , @xmath192 .",
    "the ion mean free path is a factor of @xmath176 larger than that of the electrons .",
    "this is consistent with both species satisfying @xmath193 given that @xmath194 is a factor @xmath176 larger than @xmath8 in our simulations ( see figure [ fig : benandanis_wces2500_mime25and64 ] ) .",
    "we have used particle - in - cell ( pic ) plasma simulations to study the nonlinear evolution of ion and electron velocity - space instabilities in collisionless plasmas .",
    "we have focused on instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy with @xmath195 .",
    "the motivation for doing so is in part that this sign of pressure anisotropy describes the typical conditions found in simulations of low - collisionality accretion flows onto black holes @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "an imposed shear velocity in the plasma amplifies a background magnetic field on a timescale long compared to the cyclotron motion of particles .",
    "this drives @xmath195 by the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment .",
    "the pressure anisotropy in turn drives velocity - space instabilities .",
    "the nonlinear staturated state then depends on how the velocity - space instabilities inhibit the growth of pressure anisotropy .    in order to achieve reasonable scale separation between ions and electrons ,",
    "we have focused on moderately large values for the mass ratio @xmath49 , and found that for @xmath120 and @xmath130 our results are fairly independent of the mass ratio .",
    "our calculations have focused on the parameter regime @xmath196 , which is relevant for a wide variety of heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas . in particular ,",
    "our simulations begin with @xmath197 but @xmath26 decreases as the background magnetic field is amplified in time . in this regime",
    "the mirror instability is the dominant ion - scale instability ( although with a subdominant contribution from the ic instability ) . as in previous work",
    "@xcite , the mirror instability grows to large amplitudes @xmath198 , even when the background magnetic field is amplified on a timescale long compared to the ion / electron cyclotron periods .",
    "in addition to the mirror instability , the anisotropic electrons excite the whistler instability on scales of order the electron larmor radius , much smaller than the scale of the mirror modes ( see figures [ fig : fldsmirrorwhistler ] and [ fig : cut ] ) . in the nonlinear saturated state ,",
    "the ion and electron pressure anisotropties saturate near the thresholds for the corresponding instabilty , namely mirror and whistler , respectively . moreover , the magnetic moment decreases in time due to pitch angle scattering by the relevant instabilities ( figures [ fig : benandanis_wces2500_mime25and64]@xmath112 and [ fig : benandanis_wces2500_mime25and64]@xmath82 ) .",
    "more quantitatively , the electron pressure anisotropy in simulations with infinite mass ions ( where the ions simply provide a neutralizing charge , but do not excite mirror modes ) is well described by the linear theory expectation for the whistler instability ( see figures [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000]@xmath84 and [ fig : benandanis_wces1000and5000]@xmath85 ) . for finite mass ratios ,",
    "however , the electron pressure anisotropy is further reduced by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "we attribute this to the effect of the large - amplitude mirror modes on the electrons , which reduce the growth of the perpendicular electron pressure by bunching the electrons into magnetic mirrors on lengthscales comparable to the ion larmor radius .",
    "we have also used our simulations to compute the mean free path of particles , @xmath199 ( @xmath48 ) , during the nonlinear stage of the mirror and whistler instabilities .",
    "the mean free path of both ions and electrons is reasonably well described by @xmath200 where @xmath40 is the shear rate ( the rate at which the strength of the magnetic field is amplified ) , can be dominated by small scales , i.e. , high wave number @xmath68 . however , the shear rate that matters here is related to the timescale for the magnitude of @xmath18 to change , and will thus typically be dominated by large scale dynamics . ] and @xmath132 is the threshold pressure anisotropy for the relevant velocity - space instability .",
    "physically , this equation describes the balance between pitch - angle scattering by velocity - space instabilities ( which limits the pressure anisotropy to @xmath201 ) and driving of the pressure anisotropy by the amplification of the background magnetic field at a rate @xmath40 ( see equations [ eq:1 ] & [ eq:2 ] and associated discussion ) .",
    "the threshold pressure anisotropy found in our simulations is not exactly appropriate for heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas because in the latter the shear rate is much smaller relative to the cyclotron frequency than in our simulations .",
    "the astrophysically relevant threshold for the mirror instability is @xmath202 , while for the electron whistler instability it is @xmath203 equation [ eq : whistler ] is an approximate fit to the whistler instability threshold relevant for both non - relativistic and relativistic electrons , for growth rates @xmath204 ; the relativistic calculations are based on numerical solutions of the dispersion relation derived in @xcite ( see @xcite , appendix b2 ) .",
    "the fit is accurate to about 50% for @xmath205 ( note that @xcite and @xcite found a somewhat shallower slope @xmath206 in non - relativistic calculations over a smaller range of @xmath92 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath207 in equation [ eq : whistler ] depends weakly on electron temperature , varying from @xmath208 for non - relativistic electrons to @xmath209 for @xmath210 ( relevant to hot accretion flows onto black holes ) .    for our calculations that include both ions and electrons with finite mass , we find that the electron mean free path and pressure anisotropy are reduced by factors of @xmath134 and @xmath9 , respectively , relative to the whistler only values by the trapping of electrons by the large amplitude mirrors . in this case",
    ", @xmath8 should be reduced from the whistler only value in equation [ eq : whistler ] by the same factor @xmath9 .",
    "equation [ eq : mfp ] , together with the relevant instability thresholds , provides a deceptively simple prescription for the ion and electron mean free paths in a low collisionality plasma .",
    "this in turn provides an upper limit on the thermal conductivity of low - collisionality @xmath10 plasmas .",
    "of course , these results only apply if the mean free path set by velocity - space instabilities is smaller than the coulomb mean free path for the plasma under consideration .",
    "a second implication of equation [ eq : mfp ] is that a collisionless plasma has a finite viscosity because the particles do not simply free - stream . in our simulations with a background velocity shear , the particles are thus heated by tapping into the background shear , just as in a collisional fluid .",
    "we find that the ion and electron heating rates in our simulations are in good agreement with the analytically predicted heating rate by anisotropic viscosity in the limit of a gyrotropic distribution function @xcite : @xmath211 the good agreement between equation [ eq : htg ] and our numerical heating rates in figure [ fig : energygainwhismirro ] provides additional support for including this ` viscous ' heating in models of the thermodynamics of low - collisionality plasmas .",
    "the velocity - space instabilities studied in this paper can impact the electron pressure anisotropy , mean free path , thermal conduction , and viscous heating in a wide variety of astrophysical environments , including galaxy clusters , low - luminosity accretion flows onto compact objects , and the solar wind . as a concrete example , we scale our estimate of the electron mean free path to conditions relevant to galaxy clusters using equations [ eq : mfp ] & [ eq : whistler ] : @xmath212 where @xmath213 quantifies the suppression of the thermal conductivity due to mirrors .",
    "the precise shear timescale @xmath214 for clusters is uncertain so we have scaled our estimate to about @xmath215 of the typical cluster dynamical time .",
    "this is likely a modest underestimate at large radii ( near the virial radius the timescales are somewhat longer ) and a modest overestimate at small radii ( in the core the timescales are somewhat shorter ) . for comparison ,",
    "the coulomb mean free path for a coulomb logarithm of 10 is @xmath216 note that the whistler mediated mean - free path in equation [ eq : mfp - clusters ] is independent of density .",
    "it may well be shorter than the coulomb mean free path at large radii in massive ( hot ) clusters where densities are typically @xmath217 .",
    "this highlights the importance of velocity - space instabilities in understanding the thermodynamics of the outer parts of massive galaxy clusters .",
    "our results are also relevant for models of low - luminosity accretion flows onto compact objects .",
    "in particular , our results can be incorporated as sub - grid models for electron conduction and heating in numerical simulations of black hole accretion that attempt to directly predict the emission from the accreting plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for concreteness",
    ", we note that in the accretion disk context , equation [ eq : htg ] can be rewritten in terms of the fraction @xmath218 of the total dissipation that goes into the electrons via viscous heating .",
    "the total heating rate per unit volume in magnetized accretion disks is given approximately by @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "as a result , equation [ eq : htg ] corresponds to @xmath220 where we have used equation [ eq : whistler ] .",
    "equation [ eq : htge ] predicts an electron heating rate that is a significant fraction of the total dissipation in accretion disks , and is itself only a weak function of the electron thermodynamics .. the difference lies in our treatment of the whistler instability threshold ( see equation [ eq : whistler ] and associated discussion ) . ]",
    "one limitation of our present study applied to black hole accretion flows is that these environments may be characterized by @xmath221 , which we have not considered here .",
    "@xcite & @xcite argued that for @xmath222 the ion - cyclotron instability becomes more prominent than the mirror instability at @xmath223 and that the electric fields associated with the ion - cyclotron instability can transfer energy directly to the electrons , providing a significant source of electron heating .",
    "the dominance of the ion - cyclotron instability over the mirror instabilty is not captured by the linear stability calculations we have carried out , but for the electrons these are restricted to non - relativistic plasmas .",
    "we also suspect that electron heating by the ion - cyclotron instability is sub - dominant relative to other heating mechanisms ( e.g. , turbulence and viscous heating ) given that for realistic parameters , little of the free energy of the system will reside in the electromagnetic fields associated with the ic waves .",
    "regardless , however , of this subtlety about the physics of the ion - scale instabilities , the electron pressure anisotropy will still be predominantly regulated by the whistler instability , and so the results presented in this paper are applicable for @xmath222 ( aside perhaps from the suppression of the electron mean free path by large amplitude mirrors ) .",
