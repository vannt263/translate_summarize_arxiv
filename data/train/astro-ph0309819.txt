    "the class of high mass x ",
    "ray binaries containing a be star ( be / hmxrbs ) is characterized by transient x  ray outbursts , sometimes reaching eddington luminosities , interleaved by intervals of low luminosity ( @xmath8 erg / s ) .",
    "it is possible to distinguish two types of outbursts @xcite : type  i outbursts , lasting few days and due to the increase of the accretion rate onto the neutron star as it approaches the periastron along the eccentric ( @xmath9 ) orbit ; and type  ii outbursts ( also called `` giant '' outbursts ) , lasting tens of days and thought to be due to sporadic episodes of mass ejection from the be star .",
    "the details of the accretion onto the neutron star are complicated by the poorly known outflow mechanism in be stars : because of the strong spinning of these stars , close to 70% of their break - up velocity @xcite , circumstellar material will accumulate in the equatorial region in the form of a quasi - keplerian disk .",
    "type  i outbursts are thought to originate when the neutron star passes through this slow , dense disk .",
    "quite recently , theoretical works @xcite have shown that tidal interactions can produce truncation of the be disk at a distance smaller than the periastron separation , suppressing the x  ray activity , and therefore explaining the missing of some type  i outbursts . in this model ,",
    "long term ( @xmath10 years ) cycles arise as stellar material accumulate in the be disk until tidal interactions sweep it away .",
    "the precession / warping of the be disk accounts for the irregularity of the type  ii outburst recurrences .",
    "the study of the quiescent emission in be / hmxrbs can give important clues on the accretion flow geometry because of the tremendous difference in luminosity in the quiescent and outburst states ( more than three orders of magnitude ) .",
    "in particular , we expect that the region responsible for the x  ray emission passes from being optically thick at high luminosity to be optically thin in quiescence , because of the formation of a collision - less shock above the polar caps of the neutron star during outburst states @xcite .",
    "these variations in x  ray luminosity are responsible of dramatic variations in the pulse shape @xcite , because for @xmath11 erg / s x ",
    "ray photons escape mainly in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines ( fan beam emission pattern ) , while at lower luminosities photons are emitted mainly in a direction parallel to the magnetic field lines ( pencil beam ) .",
    "the comparison of pulse shapes at different luminosities ( quiescent vs outburst phase , but also at different orbital phases during quiescence ) can give therefore some clues on the emission pattern geometry .",
    "furthermore , the study of the quiescent state in be / hmxrbs can give important information on the properties of mass accretion at very low accretion rates , and on the possible onset of a propeller state ( see section  [ discussion ] below ) , in which the accretion onto the neutron star is centrifugally inhibited .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a campaign of observations performed by bepposax in order to study the quiescent emission of  at different orbital phases , and therefore at different luminosity levels .",
    "simultaneous optical observations of hde  245770 performed at the 1.5 m cassini telescope of the bologna astronomical observatory are also presented .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    is the prototype of the be / hmxrbs .",
    "it was discovered during a type  ii outburst in 1975 @xcite , and since then three other giant outbursts and about a dozen of normal outbursts have been observed @xcite .",
    "x  ray pulsations at @xmath10104  s have been detected both during outburst @xcite and in quiescence @xcite . because of the long database of observations it was possible to resolve the binary system @xcite , that exhibits an orbital period of 111 days , and an eccentricity of 0.47 .",

    "the be star presents @xmath12 photoelectric variability correlated to the x  ray behavior of  @xcite : in particular the @xmath13 luminosity reached its maximum in 1975 ( @xmath14 @xcite ) , in correspondence of a giant x  ray outburst . the minimum was observed in 1998 ( @xmath15 @xcite ) , when the optical spectrum showed a dramatic change , with the emission lines slowly changing from emission to absorption .",

    "because of a previous observation by osse @xcite of a cyclotron resonance feature ( crf ) at 110 kev ( observed during a giant outburst ) , we tried to model the feature with a gaussian in absorption @xcite , as it has been done with other crfs observed by bepposax .",

    "recent rxte observations @xcite of the quiescent emission from  at @xmath77 erg / s ( 210 kev ; two orders of magnitude lower than that observed in past quiescent states @xcite ) pose serious problems for the standard accretion theory ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . indeed , at this luminosity level the corotation radius ( the distance from the neutron star at which the centrifugal force equals the gravitational pull ) is smaller than the magnetospheric radius (",
    "the distance at which the magnetic pressure equals the ram pressure ) , and therefore matter can not enter the magnetosphere and being accreted because of centrifugal forces ( this is the so called propeller state @xcite ) .",

    "ray observations confirm the low luminosity state of the source , and therefore its centrifugally inhibited state .",
    "the lecs observations were able to clearly detect a soft excess that could be explained both in terms of an additional thermal component , as already observed in other accreting x  ray binary pulsars , like her x1 @xcite , or overabundance of mg ( @xmath79 times the solar abundance ) in the proximity of the source .",
    "the almost absence of spectral variability during the orbit seems to point to the absence of any ( temporary ) accretion disk , as observed during a giant outburst phase from the detection of spin and qpo frequency variations @xcite .",
    "the main difference between bepposax and rxte observations is that the be disk around hde  245770 returned in place .",
    "we would have expected a higher x  ray luminosity with respect to the disk - less observations , due to the greater amount of circumstellar matter that can be accreted .",
    "therefore the presence of the be disk seems not to alter the accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "the high energy observations indicate a spectral hardening , which is in disagreement with the x  ray spectra observed during the  active phase , characterized by a spectral softening above 25  kev @xcite .",
    "this is further evidence that the kind of accretion in the quiescent and the active phase seems different . in the first bepposax observation",
    "there is a marginal ( 4@xmath62 ) evidence of a crf at 110  kev , but not of a 55  kev feature ( reported by @xcite ) .",
    "this is a confirmation of the osse observation of the crf detected during the 1994 giant outburst .",
