    "before beginning our story , i d like to state precisely what is the unique contribution of quantum cryptography .    * quantum cryptography provides a new mechanism enabling the parties communicating with one another to : @xmath0 consequently , it provides a means for determining when an encrypted communication has been compromised .",
    "this paper is based on an invited talk given at the conference on coding theory , cryptology , and number theory held at the us naval academy in annapolis , maryland in october of 1998 .",
    "it was also given as an invited talk at the quantum computational science workshop held in conjunction with the frontiers in computing conference in annapolis , maryland in february of 1999 , at a bell labs colloquium in murray hill , new jersey in april of 1999 , at the security and technology division colloquium of nist in gaithersburg , maryland , and at the quantum computation seminar at the u.s .",
    "naval research labs in washington , dc .",
    "my objective in creating this paper was to write it exactly as i had given the talk .",
    "but ...  shortly after starting this manuscript , i succumbed to the temptation of greatly embellishing the story that had been woven into the original talk .",
    "i leave it to the reader to decide whether or not this detracts from or enhances the paper .",
    "we begin our crypto drama with the introduction of two of the main characters , * alice * @xmath1and@xmath1 * bob * , representing respectively the * sender * and the * receiver*.  as in every drama , there is a triangle .",
    "the triangle is completed with the introduction of the third main character , the archvillainess * eve * , representing the * eavesdropper*.     our story begins with alice and bob attending two different universities which are unfortunately separated by a great distance .",
    "alice would like to communicate with bob without the ever vigilant eve eavesdropping on their conversation .",
    "in other words , how can alice talk with bob while at the same time preventing the evil eve from listening in on their conversation ?",
    "hoping to find some way out of her dilemma , alice elects to take a course on cryptography , crypto 351 taught by professor shannon with guest lecturers diffie , rivest , shamir , and adleman .",
    "alice thinks to herself , `` certainly this is a wise choice .",
    "it is a very applied course , and surely relevant to the real world .",
    "maybe i will learn enough to outwit eve ? ''",
    "professor shannon begins the course with a description of classical cryptographic communication systems , as illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "alice , the sender , encrypts her * plaintext * @xmath2 into * ciphertext * @xmath3 using a * secret key * @xmath4 which she shares only with bob , and sends the ciphertext @xmath3 over an * insecure channel * on which the evil eve is ever vigilantly eavesdropping .",
    "bob , the receiver , receives the ciphertext @xmath3 , and uses the secret key @xmath4 , shared by him and alice only , to decrypt the ciphertext @xmath3 into plaintext @xmath2 .",
    "fig1.ps + figure 1 .",
    "a classical cryptographic communication system .",
    "what is usually not mentioned in the description of a classical cryptographic communication system is that alice and bob must first communicate over a * secure channel * to establish a secret key @xmath4 shared only by alice and bob before they can communicate in secret over the insecure channel .",
    "such a channel could consist , for example , of a trusted courier , wearing a trench coat and dark sunglasses , transporting from alice to bob a locked briefcase chained to his wrist .",
    "in other words , we have the famous catch 22 of classical cryptography , namely :    * * catch 22 .",
    "*  there are perfectly good ways to communicate in secret , provided we can communicate in secret ...",
    "professor shannon then goes on to discuss the different types of classical communication security .",
    "a cryptographic communication system is * practically secure * if the encryption scheme can be broken after @xmath5 years , where @xmath5 is determined by one s security needs and by existing technology .",
    "practically secure cryptographic systems have existed since antiquity .",
    "one example would be the caesar cipher used by julius caesar during the during the gallic wars , a cipher that was difficult for his opponents to break at that time , but easily breakable by today s standards .",
    "a modern day example of a practically secure classical cryptographic system is the digital encryption standard ( des ) which has just recently been broken .  for this and many other reasons , des",
    "is to be replaced by a more practically secure classical encryption system , the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) .  in turn",
    ", aes will be replaced by an even more secure cryptographic system should the advances in technology ever challenge its security .",
    "a cryptographic communication is said to be * perfectly secure * if the ciphertext @xmath3 gives no information whatsoever about the plaintext @xmath2 , even when the design of the cryptographic system is known .  in mathematical terms , this can be stated succinctly with the equation : @xmath6 in other words , the probability of plaintext @xmath2 given ciphertext @xmath3 , written @xmath7 , is equal to the probability of the plaintext @xmath2 .",
    "an example of a perfectly secure classical cryptographic system is the * vernam cipher * , better known as the * one - time - pad*.  the plaintext @xmath2 is a binary sequence of zeroes and ones , i.e. , @xmath8 the secret key @xmath4 consists of a totally random binary sequence of the same length , i.e. , @xmath9  the ciphertext @xmath3 is the binary sequence @xmath10 obtained by adding the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath4 bitwise modulo @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 for example , @xmath13{rrcrrrr}p\\ \\ \\   & = & 0110\\quad0101\\quad1101 &   &   &   & \\\\ k\\ \\ \\   & = & 1010\\quad1110\\quad0100 &   &   &   & \\\\ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\ _ &   & \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\ _ &   &   &   & \\\\ c = p\\oplus k\\ \\ \\   & = & 1100\\quad1011\\quad1001 &   &   &   & \\end{array}\\ ] ]    this cipher is perfectly secure if key @xmath4 is totally random and shared only by alice and bob .",
    "it is easy to encode with the key @xmath4 .",
    "if , however , one succumbs to the temptation of using the same key @xmath4 to encode two different plaintexts @xmath14 and @xmath15 into ciphertexts @xmath16 and @xmath17 , then the cipher system immediately changes from a perfectly secure cipher to one that is easily broken by even the most amateur cryptanalyst .  for",
    ", @xmath18 is easily breakable because of the redundancy that is usually present in plaintext .",
    "the only problem with the one - time - pad is that long bit sequences must be sent over a secure channel before it can be used .",
    "this once again leads us to the catch 22 of classical cryptography , i.e. ,    * * catch 22 . *",
    "there are perfectly good ways to communicate in secret , provided we can communicate in secret ...    ... and to the :    * * key problem 1 .",
    "*  _ catch 22 _ : a secure means of communicating key is needed .",
    "finally , there are two other key problems in classical cryptography in need of a solution , namely :    * * key problem 2 . *  _ authentication _ : alice needs to determine with certainty that she is actually talking to bob , and not to an impostor such as eve .",
    "* * key problem 3 . *  _ intrusion detection _ : alice needs a means of determining whether or not eve is eavesdropping .    in summary",

    "a cipher is said to be * computationally secure * if the computational resources required to break it exceed anything possible now and into the future .",
    "for example , a cipher would be computationally secure if the number of bits of computer memory required to break it were greater than the number of atoms in the universe , or if the computational time required to break it exceeded the age of the universe .",
    "cryptographic systems can be created in such a way that it is computationally infeasible to find the decryption key @xmath20 even when the encryption key @xmath21 is known .  to create such a cryptographic system",
    ", all one would need is a trap - door function @xmath22 .",
    "a function @xmath22 is a * trap - door function * if    * @xmath22 is easy to compute , i.e. , polynomial time computable , and * given the function @xmath22 , the inverse function @xmath23can not be computed from @xmath22 in polynomial time , i.e. , such a computation is superpolynomial time , intractable , or worse .",
    "+ figure 2 .",
    "a public key cryptographic communication system    a trap - door function @xmath21 can be used to create a * public key cryptographic system * as illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "all parties who wish to communicate in secret should choose their own trap - door function @xmath21 and place it in a * public directory * , the `` * * yellow pages * * , '' for all the world to see .",
    "but they should keep their decryption key @xmath24 secret .  since @xmath21 is a trap - door function , it is computationally infeasible for anyone to use the publicly known @xmath21 to find the decryption key @xmath20 .",
    "so @xmath20 is secure in spite of the fact that its inverse @xmath21 is publicly known .",
    "if alice wishes to send a secret communication to bob , she first looks up in the yellow pages bob s encryption key @xmath25 , encrypts her plaintext @xmath2 with bob s encryption key @xmath25 to produce ciphertext @xmath26 , and then sends the ciphertext @xmath3 over a public channel .",
    "bob receives the ciphertext @xmath3 , and decrypts it back into plaintext @xmath27 using his secret decryption key @xmath28 .",
    "alice can even do more than this .",
    "she can authenticate , i.e. , sign her encrypted communication to bob so that bob knows with certitude that the message he received actually came from alice and not from an eve masquerading as alice .",
    "alice can do this by encrypting her signature @xmath29 using her secret decryption key @xmath30 into @xmath31 .",
    "she then encrypts plaintext @xmath2 plus her signature @xmath31 using bob s publicly known encryption key @xmath25 to produce the signed ciphertext @xmath32 , and then sends her signed ciphertext @xmath33 over the public channel to bob .",
    "bob can then decrypt the message as he did before to produce the signed plaintext @xmath34 .",
    "bob can verify alice s digital signature @xmath31 by looking up alice s encryption key @xmath35 in the `` yellow pages , '' and using it to find her signature @xmath36 . in this way",
    ", he authenticates that alice actually sent the message because only she knows her secret decryption key .",
    "hence , only she could have signed the plaintext .",
    "the rsa  cryptographic system is believed to be one example of a public key cryptographic system .",
    "there are many public software implementations of rsa , e.g. , pgs ( pretty good security ) .",
    "thus , besides solving the authentication problem for cryptography , public key cryptographic systems appear also to solve the catch 22 of cryptography .",
    "however , frequently the encryption and decryption keys of a public key cryptographic system are managed by a central key bank .  in this case , the catch 22 problem is still there .",
    "for that reason , we have entered ` maybe ' in the summary given below .    @xmath19{ll}\\text{\\underline{\\textbf{check list } } for pks } & \\\\ & \\\\ \\qquad\\blacksquare\\text { catch 22 solved ? } & \\qquad\\qquad\\text{\\textbf{maybe}}\\\\ & \\\\ \\qquad\\blacksquare\\text { authentication ? } & \\qquad\\qquad\\text{\\textbf{yes}}\\\\ & \\\\ \\qquad\\blacksquare\\text { intrusion detection ? } & \\qquad\\qquad\\text{\\textbf{no}}\\end{array } $ } \\ ] ]",
    "in spite of alice s many intense efforts to avoid taking a course in quantum mechanics , she was finally forced by her university s general education requirements ( gers ) to register for the course quantum 317 , taught by professor dirac with guest lecturers feynman , bennett , and brassard .",
    "she did so reluctantly .",
    "`` after all , '' she thought , `` certainly this is an insane requirement .",
    "quantum mechanics is not applied .",
    "it s too theoretical to be relevant to the real world .",
    "but i do want to graduate . ''",
    "professor dirac began the course with a brief introduction to the classical world of information .",
    "in particular , alice was introduced to the classical shannon bit , and shown that he / she / it is a very decisive individual .",
    "the shannon bit is either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , but by no means both at the same time .     `` hmm ... , '' she thought , `` i bet that almost everyone i know is gainfully employed because of the shannon bit . ''",
    "the professor ended his brief discussion of the shannon bit by mentioning that there is one of its properties that we take for granted .",
    "i.e. , it can be copied .",
    "next professor dirac switched to the mysterious world of the quantum .",
    "he began by introducing the runt of the bit clan , i.e. , the quantum bit , nicknamed * qubit*.  he began by showing the class a small dot , i.e. , a quantum dot .",
    "in fact it was so small that alice could nt see it at all .",
    "he promptly pulled out a microscope , and projected a large image on a screen for the entire class to view .",
    "professor dirac went on to say , `` in contrast to the decisive classical shannon bit , the qubit is a very indecisive individual .",
    "it is both @xmath37 and @xmath38 at the same time !  moreover , unlike the shannon bit , the qubit can not be copied because of the no cloning theorem of dieks , wootters , and zurek@xcite@xcite .",
    "qubits are very slippery characters , exceedingly difficult to deal with . ''",
    "`` one example of a qubit is a spin @xmath39 particle which can be in a spin - up state @xmath40 which we label as @xmath38 , in a spin - down state @xmath41 which we label as @xmath37 , or in a * superposition * of these states , which we interpret as being both @xmath37 and @xmath38 at the same time . ''",
    "( the term `` superposition '' will be explained shortly . )     `` another example of a qubit is the polarization state of a photon .",
    "a photon can be in a vertically polarized state @xmath42 .",
    "we assign a label of @xmath38 to this state",
    ".  it can be in a horizontally polarized state @xmath43 .",
    "we assign a label of @xmath37 to this state . or",
    ", it can be in a superposition of these states . in this case",
    ", we interpret its state as representing both @xmath37 and @xmath38 at the same time . ''",
    "`` anyone who has worn polarized sunglasses should be familiar with the polarization states of the photon .",
    "polarized sunglasses eliminate glare because they let through only vertically polarized light while filtering out the horizontally polarized light that is reflected from the road . ''",
    "but where do qubits live ?",
    "they live in a hilbert space @xmath44 . by a hilbert space ,",
    "we mean :    a * hilbert space * is a vector space over the complex numbers @xmath45 together with an inner product @xmath46 such that    * @xmath47 for all @xmath48 * @xmath49 for all @xmath50 and @xmath51 * @xmath52 for all @xmath50 , where the superscript ` @xmath53 ' denotes complex conjugation .",
    "* for every cauchy sequence @xmath54  in @xmath44 , @xmath55    in other words , a hilbert space is a vector space over the complex numbers @xmath45 with a sequilinear inner product in which sequences that should converge actually do converge to points in the space .",
    "the elements of @xmath44 are called * kets * , and will be denoted by @xmath56 where ` @xmath57 ' and ` @xmath58 ' are left and right delimiters , and ` @xmath59 ' denotes any label , i.e. , name , we wish to assign to a ket .",
    "so finally , we can define what is meant by a qubit .",
    "a * qubit * is a ket ( state ) in a two dimensional hilbert space @xmath44 .",
    "thus , if we let @xmath41 and @xmath40 denote an arbitrary orthonormal basis of a two dimensional hilbert space @xmath44 , then each qubit in @xmath44 can be written in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .  since any scalar multiple of a ket represents the same state of an isolated quantum system , we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath63 is a ket of unit length , i.e. , that @xmath64    the above qubit is said to be in a * superposition * of the states @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is what we mean when we say that a qubit can be simultaneously both @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , if the qubit is observed it immediately `` makes a decision . ''",
    "it `` decides '' to be @xmath37 with probability @xmath65 and @xmath38 with probability @xmath66 .",
    "some physicists call this the * `` collapse '' * of the wave function .      given a hilbert space @xmath44 ,",
    "let @xmath67 denote the set of all linear maps from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath68 is actually a hilbert space , called the * dual * hilbert space of @xmath44 , with scalar product and vector sum defined by : @xmath69{lcll}\\left (   \\lambda\\cdot f\\right )   \\left (   \\left|   \\psi\\right\\rangle \\right )   & = & \\lambda\\left (   f(\\left|   \\psi\\right\\rangle ) \\right )   \\text { , } & \\text{for all } \\lambda\\in\\mathbb{c}\\text { and for all } f\\in\\mathcal{h}^{\\ast}\\\\ &   &   & \\\\ \\left (   f_{1}+f_{2}\\right )   \\left (   \\left|   \\psi\\right\\rangle \\right )   & = & f_{1}\\left (   \\left|   \\psi\\right\\rangle \\right )   + f_{2}\\left (   \\left| \\psi\\right\\rangle \\right )   \\text { , } & \\text{for all } f_{1},f_{2}\\in\\mathcal{h}^{\\ast}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    we call the elements of @xmath68 * bra * s , and denote them as : @xmath70    we can now define a bilinear map @xmath71 by @xmath72 since bra @xmath73 is a complex valued function of kets .",
    "we denote this product more simply as @xmath74 and call it the * bra - c - ket * ( or * bracket * ) of bra @xmath75 and ket @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the bracket induces a dual correspondence between @xmath44 and @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath77      all `` activities '' in the quantum world are linear transformations @xmath78 from the hilbert space @xmath44 into itself , called * unitary transformations * ( or , * unitary operators * ) .",
    "if we think of linear transformations as matrices , then a * unitary transformation * @xmath79 is a square matrix of complex numbers such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the matrix obtained from @xmath79 by conjugating all its entries and then transposing the matrix .",
    "we denote @xmath81 by @xmath82 , and refer to it as the * adjoint * of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , an `` activity '' in the quantum world would be , for example , a unitary transformation @xmath79 that carries a state ket @xmath83 at time @xmath84 to a state ket @xmath85 at time @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87      in quantum mechanics , what does an observer observe ?",
    "all * observables * in the quantum world are linear transformations @xmath88 from the hilbert space @xmath44 into itself , called * hermitian operators * ( or , * self - adjoint operators * ) . if we think of linear transformations as matrices , then a * hermitian operator * @xmath89 is a square matrix of complex numbers such that @xmath90 where @xmath91 again denotes the matrix obtained from @xmath89 by conjugating all its entries , and then transposing the matrix .  as before ,",
    "we denote @xmath91 by @xmath92 , and refer to it as the * adjoint * of @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath93 denote the eigenvectors , called * eigenkets * , of an observable @xmath89 , and let @xmath94 denote the corresponding eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath95 in the cases we consider in this talk , the eigenkets form an orthonormal basis of the underlying hilbert space @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we can answer our original question , i.e. , @xmath96    let us suppose that we have a physical device @xmath97 that is so constructed that it measures an observable @xmath89 , and that we wish to use @xmath97 to measure a quantum system which just happens to be in a quantum state @xmath98 .",
    "we assume @xmath99 is a ket of unit length .",
    "the quantum state @xmath99 can be written as a linear combination of the eigenkets of @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath100 when we use the device @xmath97 to measure @xmath99 , we observe the eigenvalue @xmath94 with probability @xmath101 , and in addition , after the measurement the quantum system has `` collapsed '' into the state @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the outcome of a measurement is usually random , and usually has a lasting impact on the state of the quantum system .",
    "we can use dirac notation to write down an expression for the average observed value .",

    "if @xmath105 and @xmath106 are incompatible , i.e. , do not commute , then , by measuring @xmath105 more precisely , we are forced to measure @xmath106 less precisely , and vice versa .",
    "we can not simultaneously measure both @xmath105 and @xmath106 to to unlimited precision .",
    "measurement of @xmath105 somehow has an impact on the measurement of @xmath106 .      for the purpose of illustrating heisenberg s uncertainty principle , professor dirac wheeled out into the classroom a device to demonstrate young s two slit experiment .",
    "the device consisted of an electron gun which spewed out electrons in the direction of a wall with two slits .",
    "the electrons that managed to pass through the two slits then impacted on a backstop which consisted of a @xmath113 rectangular lattice of extremely small counters .  from the back of the backstop ,",
    "all of the 1,920,000 tiny counters on the backstop were individually connected to a pc by a cable consisting of a dense bundle of filaments .",
    "professor dirac pointed to the pc , and explained that the pc was setup to display on the crt s @xmath113 pixel screen the individual running total counts of all the backstop counters .",
    "he went on to say that the intensity @xmath114 of pixel @xmath115 on the screen was proportional to the total number of electrons counted so far by the counter at position @xmath115 in the backstop .",
    "professor dirac proceeded to demonstrate what the device could actually do .",
    "he turned on the electron gun , and turned down its intensity so low that the probability of more than two electrons being emitted at the same time was negligibly small .",
    "his first experiment with the device was to cover slit 2 , allowing the incoming electrons to pass only through slit 1 .",
    "he reset all the counters on the backstop to zero , and then stepped back to let the students in his class view the screen .",
    "initially nothing could be seen on the screen but blackness .",
    "however , gradually an intensity pattern began to form on the screen .  at first",
    "the displayed pattern was indiscernible .",
    "but eventually it began to look like the intensity pattern of a classical two dimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "he then pressed a key on his computer to show a three dimensional plot of the intensity @xmath114 as a surface in 3-space .  then with the click of a mouse",
    ", he displayed a plot of the intensity @xmath114 along the vertical line @xmath116 going down the center of the screen .",
    "the plot was that of the bell shaped classical one dimensional gaussian distribution curve @xmath117 , as shown in fig .",
    "this was a clear indication that the random impacts on the backstop were obeying the classical gaussian distribution .",
    "when he repeated the experiment with the slit 1 instead of slit 2 covered , exactly the same pattern of a classical two dimensional gaussian distribution pattern was seen , but only this time shifted vertically down a short distance on the screen .",

    "young s two slit experiment with one slit closed .",
    "professor dirac then asked the students in the class what pattern they thought would appear if he left both of the slits uncovered .",
    "most of the class responded by saying that the resulting light pattern would simply be the sum of the two patterns , i.e. , the bell shaped curve @xmath119 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3c by the curve labeled @xmath120 .",
    "most of the class was convinced that the two classical probability distributions would simply add , as many of them had learned in the probability course prob 323 .",
    "the remainder of the class stated quite emphatically that they did not care what happened .",
    "what was being illustrated was far from an applied area , and hence not relevant to their real world .",
    "or so they thought ...",
    "professor dirac smiled , and then proceeded to uncover both slits .",
    "what appeared on the screen to almost everyone s surprise was not the pattern with the bell shape @xmath119 .",

    "one finds destructive interference .  in the bright areas ,",

    "`` but what happens when we actually try to observe through which slit each electron passes ? ''    professor dirac pulled out his trusty microscope to observe which of the two slits each electron passed through .",
    "he reset all the backstop counters to zero , turned on the device , and began observing through which slit each electron passed through .",

    "`` on the other hand , i could also take advantage of implementation weaknesses . ''",
    "`` one of the great difficulties with quantum cryptography is that technology has not quite caught up with it .",
    "many devices , such as lasers , do not emit a single quantum , but many quanta at each emission time .",
    "the implementation of quantum protocols really requires single - quantum emitters .  such single - quantum emitters are now under development .  until such emitters become available ,",
    "the quantum protocols can only be approximately implemented . ''     `` for example , for many optical implementations of quantum protocols , the laser intensity is turned down so that on the average only one photon is produced every 10 pulses .",
    "thus , if anything is emitted at all ( one chance out of 10 ) , then the probability that it is a single photon is extremely high .",
    "however , when there is an emission , then there is a probability of @xmath158 that more than one photon is emitted .",
    "so it is conceivable that i ( eve ) could build an eavesdropping device that would detect multiple photon transmissions , and , when so detected , would divert one of the photons for measurement .  in this way",
    ", i ( eve ) could conceivably read @xmath158 of alice s transmission without being detected .",
    "one way of countering this type of threat is to allow for it during privacy amplification .",
    "another is to develop devices which actually truly emit one quanta at a time . ''",
    "`` finally , depending on alice s implementation , it might also be possible for me ( eve ) to gain information simply by observing alice s transmitter without measuring its output .",
    "this may or may not be far fetched . ''",
    "eve then returned to her seat .",
    "her face was lit up with a sinister grin of satisfaction .",
    "before continuing our story , we should mention that quantum cryptographic protocols have been implemented over more than 30 kilometers of fiber optic cable , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and most amazingly , over more than a kilometer of free space @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite in the presence of ambient sunlight .",
    "there have been a number of ambitious proposals to demonstrate the feasibility of quantum cryptography in earth to satellite communications .  and as mentioned earlier",
    ", there is a clear need for the development of single - quantum emitting devices .",
    "much remains to be done .",
    "there has been some work on the development of multiple - user quantum cryptographic protocols for communication networks@xcite .",
    "there also have been at least two independent claims of the proof of ultimate security , i.e. , a proof that quantum cryptographic protocols are impervious to all possible eavesdropping strategies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our story continues :    as alice sat in her seat , she happened to spy in the corner of her eye an abrupt change in eve s demeanor .  eve suddenly became agitated , lit up with excitement , and started to frantically write on her notepad .",
    "the bell rang .",
    "eve immediately jumped up , and raced out of the lecture hall , being pushed along by the usual frantic mass of students , equally eager to get out of the classroom .",
    "as eve whisked past , alice caught just a fleeting glimpse of eve s notepad .",
    "all alice was able to discern in that brief moment was an illegible jumble of equations and ... yes , ... the acronym `` povm . ''",
    "alice thought to herself , `` oh , well ! ... forget it !",
