    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy  @xcite have been able to tightly constrain the curvature of the universe .",
    "the results indicate that the universe is close to being spatially flat , with current limits of @xmath0 at one sigma .",
    "however closed models still take up a significant part of the possible parameter space , and unless the universe is significantly open we shall probably never be able to rule out closed models . in this paper",
    "we discuss an approach to quantum cosmology which yields closed inflationary universes consistent with the current observations .    over the past three years",
    "there has been a development of methods treating open universes  @xcite in the context of euclidean quantum cosmology  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adapt these methods to closed universes , and use them to calculate the perturbation power spectrum for such models .",
    "the reader is referred to the above papers for general details ; here we mainly emphasize the new considerations arising from the closed geometry . in many ways",
    "the closed calculations are easier , with the spatial hypersurfaces being compact and the analytic continuation being simpler .",
    "a major difference is that a different variable must be used to represent the scalar fluctuations about the instanton in the closed case , due to the different ranges of the background variables .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we firstly describe non - singular and singular closed instantons and their analytic continuations to possible universes .",
    "we then introduce variables suitable for the description of scalar fluctuations across the entire instantons and show that in both cases negative modes exist which render these instantons unstable . for the non - singular case we show that at least two negative modes exist , excluding these from even speculative tunneling applications  @xcite . in the singular case",
    "we are able to motivate a constraint at the singularities  @xcite , which projects out these negative modes .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the predicted scalar and tensor perturbations about such constrained singular closed instantons .",
    "we calculate the two - point correlation functions in the euclidean region and analytically continue these expressions into the lorentzian region .",
    "we compute the power spectra at the end of inflation and use these as initial conditions for the radiation dominated era in to order to compute the predicted cmb power spectra for a given cosmological model . the suitability of these models as descriptions of the early history of our universe",
    "is then commented upon .",
    "consider a closed universe with line element @xmath1 and scalar field @xmath2 with potential @xmath3 .",
    "the friedmann equation reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spatial curvature constant , with @xmath6 corresponding to a closed universe .",
    "one sees that it is possible for both @xmath7 and @xmath2 to be stationary at the same time , @xmath8 say , if at this moment @xmath7 and @xmath2 are such that @xmath9 . around @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath2",
    "will then have power series expansions even in @xmath10 .",
    "hence one may consider the analytic continuation @xmath11 , under which both @xmath7 and @xmath2 remain real .",
    "the line element then takes the euclidean form @xmath12 with @xmath13 the radius of the three - sphere , related to @xmath7 by @xmath14 .",
    "the einstein and scalar field equations take the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there are solutions to these equations with various geometries . for the open case of ref .",
    "@xcite the background metric and scalar field behaved appropriately at a pole . here",
    "we are interested in solutions symmetric about an equator ( where @xmath19 ) that have continuations into a real closed universe",
    ".    one can introduce conformal coordinates in both the euclidean and lorentzian regions , defined by integrating @xmath20 and @xmath21 from the matching surface . in this closed case ,",
    "since the scale factor is finite at the matching point , the conformal coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 behave just like @xmath24 and @xmath10 and can be continued into each other similarly .",
    "this is another significant simplification when compared to the open case .    by virtue of the boundary conditions required by the continuation we see that @xmath25 and @xmath2 must be symmetrical about the equator of the instanton . for potentials @xmath26 greater than or equal to zero , evolving the equation for @xmath25 from the equator enables one to see that @xmath25 must twice reach zero a finite distance in @xmath24 away , at @xmath27 say .",
    "these are poles of the instanton . because of the the symmetry about the equator they must be of the same form and can either be regular or singular , as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "singular instantons exist for almost any scalar field potential , whereas the regular instantons can only exist for potentials which have a local maximum and are sufficiently negatively curved in the region of the peak ( from the work of  @xcite we require that @xmath28 ) .",
    "see the illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : contil ] .    to reiterate",
    ", the key difference between open and closed instantons is that the former have their boundary conditions imposed by behavior at a pole whereas the latter have their boundary conditions imposed by behavior at the equator .",
    "one might ask if these conditions ever overlap .",
    "indeed they do , as it is possible to continue any regular closed instanton not from its equator into a closed universe but from one of its poles into an open universe . from the open point of view , these correspond to the `` multibounce '' instantons mentioned in sec .  3 of  @xcite .",
    "from the negative mode argument presented there , one immediately suspects that these solutions will have more than one negative mode and hence not be relevant for cosmological applications .",
    "indeed , we will prove below that a large class of these non - singular models have at least two negative modes .",
    "we now turn to investigate the scalar fluctuations about these instantons .",
    "our starting point is the second order action for scalar perturbations in the lorentzian universe , as discussed in sec . 4 of  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for definitions .",
    "the result we use agrees with that given in  @xcite up to a surface term , and is reproduced here , @xmath29 this is well defined for all values of @xmath30 and the three - space laplacian @xmath31 . in a closed universe @xmath32 and the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a positive integer .    for the spatially inhomogeneous modes",
    "@xmath36 we introduce the momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and rewrite the action in first - order form , as in eq .",
    "( 20 ) of  @xcite",
    ". then we integrate over @xmath40 , leaving us with a delta functional for @xmath41 .",
    "integrating over this effectively sets @xmath41 to zero . for the homogeneous @xmath42 mode",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath38 disappear from the action , so we can only introduce momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "however the action can still be rewritten in first - order form , and has the same form as in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "so we now have the following expression for all modes in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath43 , @xmath39 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 : @xmath46 the @xmath47 mode corresponds to a gauge degree of freedom and is ignored as discussed in sec .  4 of  @xcite .",
    "we now have some choice in deciding which linear combination of variables to use in order to describe the single scalar degree of freedom of the system .",
    "as we shall see , different choices are particularly suited to different background solutions .",
    "from our experience  @xcite with hawking - moss  @xcite and coleman - de luccia  @xcite instantons one expects a variable related to @xmath39 to be a good variable to use in treating closed instantons .",
    "we remind the reader that , as discussed in detail in  @xcite , a good variable is one whose euclidean action is bounded below for all normalized fluctuations of that variable about the instanton in question .",
    "this corresponds to having a positive kinetic term in the euclidean action for all values of @xmath31 .",
    "we discussed closed instantons in sec .",
    "[ sec - closedinst ] .",
    "the simplest instanton is that of hawking and moss , which has the scalar field constant and at a local maximum of the potential .",
    "it is a round @xmath48 and has @xmath49 invariance .",
    "it can be analytically continued to either the closed or the open slicing of de sitter space .",
    "the closed instantons discussed in sec .  [ sec - closedinst ] may , as discussed above , also be continued to open or closed inflationary universes .    under an open continuation , we have  @xcite @xmath50 whereas under a closed continuation , @xmath51 as discussed above .",
    "the differing analytic continuations ensure that if one starts in the lorentzian region in either an open or a closed slicing , one gets an identical expression when continued back to the euclidean region .",
    "for example , the combination @xmath52 occurs in both lorentzian regions .",
    "this continues to @xmath53 in the euclidean region from an open universe , or to @xmath54 from a closed universe .",
    "however , @xmath5 is negative in an open universe , so these two expressions really differ only by a sign .",
    "in fact , the sign is also mopped up by another minus sign originating from @xmath55 so that both continuations produce an identical euclidean action , as long as we interpret @xmath5 in the euclidean region to really be @xmath56 of the lorentzian region .",
    "since this paper only deals with closed universes , for which @xmath5 is positive , we can ignore this subtlety .",
    "4 of  @xcite introduced a variable which made the negative mode structure transparent . here",
    "we attempt to adapt the argument to the case of a closed instanton .",
    "we introduce the gauge invariant perturbation variable @xmath57 , @xmath58 after integrating out the other variables from  ( [ eq : oneact ] ) , analytically continuing to the euclidean region , and introducing the rescaled variable @xmath59 we obtain the action @xmath60 one might think that if @xmath61 across the instanton , so that the @xmath62 always has a positive coefficient , @xmath63 might be a homogeneous negative mode . however , there are two subtleties in the closed case which did not occur in the parallel case for open - only instantons ( for which @xmath64 is always positive . )",
    "firstly , because the scale factor is finite on the matching surface and @xmath64 is zero there , @xmath65 is not well defined in the closed case .",
    "secondly , the natural measure in the open - only case was @xmath66 , but in the closed case this vanishes on the equator and so is inadmissible",
    ". however the variable @xmath67 is well defined , and we can proceed to derive the action in terms of this variable .    starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : oneact ] ) we perform the path integral over @xmath45 which imposes a delta functional allowing us to express @xmath37 in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath68 . after integrating by parts to remove terms in the derivatives of the conjugate momenta",
    "we define @xmath69 as the variable conjugate to @xmath70 . substituting @xmath68 for @xmath69 we find the action is independent of @xmath43 , and so its path integral can be neglected as an infinite gauge - orbit volume . finally performing the gaussian integral over @xmath69 we obtain the euclidean action @xmath71{{\\tilde{q}}}^2\\right ) .",
    "{ \\label{eq : closedact}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath72 is well behaved at the equator because @xmath2 is an even function for the closed instanton , and this action is suitable as long as @xmath73 across the entire instanton .",
    "one can confirm this numerically in any particular case of interest  most regular closed instantons leading to reasonable amounts of inflation satisfy this condition .",
    "as expected one can confirm that @xmath74 is a spatially homogeneous negative mode of the fluctuation operator associated with this action .",
    "however , @xmath64 is odd about the equator so this negative mode has a node .",
    "the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue must be nodeless and hence there must exist a symmetric mode function with a more negative eigenvalue .",
    "( this can be confirmed numerically by substituting a symmetric test function , @xmath75 say , into  ( [ eq : closedact ] ) and checking that the action integral over the instanton is negative . )",
    "so we have proved that these instantons must have at least two negative modes , and therefore can not have anything to do with tunneling  @xcite .",
    "this confirms explicitly the arguments based on spectral flow from the hawking - moss instanton given in sec .  3 of  @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware , there is no way to constrain these instantons to eliminate their instabilities .",
    "thus there is no motivation for considering them as being significant in the euclidean quantum path integral .",
    "no tunneling role being apparent either , we do not consider these instantons further .",
    "instead we now turn to singular instantons , where suitable constraints may be applied .",
    "on singular instantons , as the scalar field runs away to infinity at the poles , the condition @xmath76 is certainly violated .",
    "this means that @xmath57 is not a suitable variable to use when investigating fluctuations around closed singular instantons .",
    "a good physical choice of variable is the gauge invariant combination @xmath77 the comoving curvature perturbation . in the gauge @xmath78",
    "this is just @xmath37 .",
    "notice that in the definition the factors @xmath79 and @xmath64 are combined in such a way as to be finite at the equator of the instanton , since in this closed case both go linearly to zero there .    using the definition we substitute @xmath39 for @xmath80 in equation  ( [ eq : oneact ] ) .",
    "the path integral over @xmath45 imposes a delta functional which allows us to express @xmath37 in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath68 . after integrating by parts to remove terms in the derivatives of the conjugate momenta",
    "we define @xmath81 as the variable conjugate to @xmath80 . substituting @xmath68 for @xmath81 we find the action is independent of @xmath43 , and so its path integral can be neglected as an infinite gauge - orbit volume . finally performing the gaussian integral over @xmath81 and continuing to the euclidean region",
    "we are left with @xmath82 { { { \\cal x}}}^2{\\right)}{\\label{eq : nact}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath83 for clarity .",
    "let us now examine the behavior of this action across the instanton .",
    "for @xmath84 to be a suitable variable we need the coefficient of the kinetic term to be positive everywhere . remembering that the eigenvalues of @xmath85 are @xmath34 ,",
    "where @xmath35 is a positive integer ( and @xmath5 is a positive real number in this closed case ) , we see that this is indeed the case for spatially inhomogeneous fluctuations . in the homogeneous case ( @xmath86 ) it will be positive if @xmath87 across the instanton .",
    "this can be checked numerically for any case of interest , but we can also make analytic arguments for wide classes of cosmological instantons .",
    "let us first examine behavior near the equator . from the scalar field equation in proper euclidean time , we have @xmath88 and from the equation for the scale factor we have @xmath89 .",
    "hence @xmath90 . for a monomial potential @xmath91",
    ", we can link the starting value @xmath92 of the field with the number @xmath93 of e - foldings by the relation  @xcite @xmath94 , leading to the requirement that @xmath95 . for",
    "cosmologically interesting solutions , we require @xmath96 , and so for @xmath97 the kinetic term is positive . now let us examine the behavior near the singularities .",
    "using the background field equations we have the relation @xmath98 if @xmath99 is the conformal distance from a singularity , @xmath100 goes like @xmath99 and @xmath2 goes like @xmath101 .",
    "so @xmath102 goes like @xmath103 and we see that @xmath104 simply goes like @xmath105 , staying positive .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : ant1 ] for a graph showing the behavior of @xmath25 and @xmath106 across a typical instanton .",
    "it remains to examine the behavior of the potential term across the instanton . at the equator",
    "@xmath107 tends to a finite constant , since @xmath106 is even in @xmath24 and has an @xmath108 term .",
    "near a singularity the same term vanishes like @xmath109 .",
    "hence the potential tends to a finite constant , and furthermore in the special case of the spatially homogeneous mode it tends to zero .",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath84 is therefore a suitable variable to use for investigating a wide range of singular closed instantons .",
    "we must now address the question of instabilities of these instantons , which we do by examining the behavior of mode functions near the singularity .",
    "the idea of euclidean quantum cosmology is that the euclidean path integral should uniquely determine the quantum state of the universe .",
    "if the instantons discussed above are to be a useful approximation , it must be that the euclidean action for small fluctuations about these instantons uniquely determines the set of allowed fluctuation modes .",
    "consider first the inhomogeneous modes .",
    "the mode equation associated with the action  ( [ eq : nact ] ) above takes the form @xmath110 near a singularity , with general solutions of the form @xmath111 . substituting back into the expression for the action we see that the logarithmically divergent solution has positive infinite euclidean action and",
    "hence is totally suppressed by the euclidean path integral .",
    "hence the euclidean action uniquely determines the state of the spatially inhomogeneous modes .    for the homogeneous modes the equation takes the form @xmath112 , with general solutions of the form @xmath113 .",
    "now however , substituting back we find that both solutions have finite action .",
    "hence the euclidean path integral can not uniquely determine the state of the homogeneous fluctuations .",
    "this tells us that singular closed instantons are not indeed true saddle points of the euclidean action , as might have been expected from experience with the singular open instantons of  @xcite .",
    "however , as there , one can proceed to introduce a constraint at each of the singularities .",
    "a suitable constraint is provided by the work of kirklin , turok and wiseman  @xcite , as applied in  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to fixing @xmath114 at each singularity .",
    "we must have the same value of @xmath115 at each singularity in order that the instanton be symmetric about the equator .",
    "each value of @xmath115 effectively corresponds to a given value of @xmath2 at the equator via the background field equations .",
    "so we are left with a one - parameter family of instantons , corresponding to lorentzian universes with different starting points for the scalar field in its potential .",
    "we are free to set this parameter to give a universe like that which we see today .",
    "we then require that fluctuations satisfy @xmath116 at the singularities . in the gauge",
    "@xmath78 this condition reduces to @xmath117 at the singularities .",
    "but this , up to a constant , is just our @xmath84 .",
    "hence we require that the homogeneous modes behave like @xmath118 near the singularities .",
    "we can now numerically solve this eigenproblem of finding the lowest eigenvalue such that the associated eigenmode satisfies these boundary conditions .",
    "it has turned out that for the instantons we have considered that this eigenvalue has indeed been positive .",
    "hence the constraint has projected out the unstable negative modes .    thus closed singular instantons , so constrained ,",
    "have been shown to provide a sensible starting point for a perturbation expansion and we now proceed to calculate the correlators for fluctuations about these instantons , and their observational consequences for the cmb .",
    "to work out the observable predictions from the instanton we wish to compute the power spectrum for the perturbations at the end of inflation , and relate it to the power spectrum in the early radiation dominated era .",
    "we define the power spectrum so that the gradient of the 3-ricci scalar on co - moving hypersurfaces ( i.e. in the rest frame of the total energy , denoted by a tilde ) receives power @xmath119 where the @xmath120 . at the end of inflation",
    "the curvature perturbation variable @xmath80 is simply related to the perturbation in the 3-ricci scalar , giving @xmath121 this convention for the power spectrum is the natural closed analogue of that given in  @xcite , where in the flat space limit a scale invariant spectrum corresponds to @xmath122 .",
    "since we are only considering single field inflation the perturbations will be adiabatic and the curvature perturbation is conserved on super - hubble scales . the power spectrum is therefore time independent , and what we compute at the end of inflation will accurately predict the super - hubble power spectrum in the radiation dominated era .",
    "it is convenient to do a harmonic expansion in terms of normalized eigenfunctions @xmath123 , where @xmath124 @xmath125 the curvature perturbation is then expanded in terms of its modes as @xmath126 inserting the mode expansion into the second order action and integrating by parts the action takes the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a second order linear differential operator .",
    "the action for all modes with the same eigenvalue is equivalent , so we drop the @xmath129 and @xmath115 subscripts .",
    "the power spectrum that we wish to compute will be given by the correlator for the modes @xmath130 .",
    "doing the sum over the degenerate modes of the same eigenvalue we obtain @xmath131 for perturbations we are only interested in @xmath132 , and the factor of @xmath133 is just the volume of the three - sphere .",
    "we compute the lorentzian green function @xmath134 by analytic continuation from the euclidean green function . to compute the correlator we need to solve the equation for the euclidean green function @xmath135 the operator",
    "@xmath128 is in sturm - louville form @xmath136 , and we can therefore construct the green function from two classical solutions . to give the delta function at @xmath137",
    "the classical solutions are joined together with a change in derivative of @xmath138 . as discussed in the section above",
    ", the euclidean action infinitely suppresses the logarithmically divergent solution near a singularity , and so @xmath139 is constructed from two classical solutions @xmath140 and @xmath141 satisfying neumann boundary conditions at @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively . for @xmath144we have @xmath145 with the corresponding result for @xmath146 . from the differential equation",
    "the denominator is in fact independent of @xmath147 and is conveniently evaluated on the equator at @xmath148 . by symmetry , we may choose @xmath149 , and so the denominator just becomes @xmath150 evaluated at @xmath148 .",
    "we now have an expression for the euclidean correlator which may be analytically continued into the closed lorentzian universe .",
    "to continue the expression for the correlator to the lorentzian universe , we need to set @xmath151 . for small @xmath22 and @xmath23 we have @xmath152 and @xmath153 is therefore complex . at later times",
    "it will have the form @xmath154 where the real part is even [ @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and the imaginary part is odd [ @xmath157 , @xmath158 . dividing through by the denominator @xmath159 and taking the equal time limit of the lorentzian green function we get @xmath160 for reference the equal - time lorentzian correlator then takes the simple form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the angle between @xmath163 and @xmath164 on the three - sphere .",
    "notice that we have been able to continue @xmath35 by @xmath35 and that we have had no convergence problems since the @xmath165 s just oscillate ; the continuation has been much simpler than in the open case discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it has also become possible to numerically calculate the power spectrum essentially exactly .",
    "we do this by making a taylor expansion of @xmath140 say in the euclidean region near the singularity at @xmath166 , namely @xmath167 .",
    "we then numerically evolve this solution from near the singularity to the equator , and then evolve the lorentzian equations until the modes are well outside the horizon and are constant .",
    "we then compute the lorentzian correlator for the mode . by repeating this for each @xmath35 of interest",
    ", we obtain an accurate numerical power spectrum @xmath168 .",

    "although we do not understand the reheating process it is well known that for adiabatic perturbations the curvature perturbation is conserved on super - horizon scales , as is the tensor metric perturbation .",
    "the power spectra we have computed at the end of inflation therefore accurately predict the curvature perturbation power spectra for the early radiation dominated era that we need as the starting point for the cmb computation .",
    "we use camb  @xcite , a modified version of cmbfast  @xcite , to compute the resulting cmb anisotropies .    since we do not know how reheating proceeds",

    "flat models one can fix the quadrupole ratio to good accuracy analytically  @xcite .",
    "however in general models the presence of curvature or a cosmological constant introduces an additional integrated sachs - wolfe effect at low multipoles that renders the flat result very inaccurate . in closed models",
    "there is also a maximum wavelength cutoff which reduces the contribution to the low multipole tensor anisotropy . to compute the cmb power spectra correctly we computed the initial power spectra normalized as described in this paper .",
    "the camb package was then updated to support absolute computations from normalized initial power spectra so that the scalar and tensor cmb power spectra we compute are in the correct ratio .",
    "this improves the approximate ratio fixing scheme that was used in  @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the power spectra are very similar to the predictions of flat slow - roll inflation on small scales , as expected .",

    "small deviations from the slow - roll predictions are apparent only on the largest scales on which the curvature can be significant . using the power spectra as the initial conditions for the radiation dominated universe we are able to compute predictions for cmb anisotropies in particular closed models .",
