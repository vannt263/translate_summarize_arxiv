    "p - p_collisions is important for improving our understanding of qcd and the hadronization process , as well as providing a vital baseline for comparison to measurements being performed in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are a preliminary study of _ p - p_collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev by the star collaboration from run-6 .",
    "we utilize the mid - rapidity time projection chamber ( tpc ) and barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) to measure both the charged and neutral particle production .",
    "a jet - patch trigger , requiring e@xmath18 gev in a @xmath2 x @xmath3 = 1x1 patch of the bemc , was used to collect the data .",
    "this creates a neutral energy fragmentation bias for the triggering jet , hence charged particle fragmentation functions are presented only for the di - jet partner not associated with the triggered jet - patch .",
    "the k@xmath4 and anti - k@xmath4 recombination and siscone jet algorithms from the fastjet package  @xcite were used to reconstruct jets .",
    "a cut of @xmath5@xmath60.2 gev / c was applied to all charged particles considered in the event , and @xmath7@xmath60.2 gev for all neutral particles reconstructed in the bemc . to investigate how the resolution parameters , r=@xmath8 , used in this study",
    "affect the reconstructed jet energy , the siscone algorithm was first run with r=1 .",
    "the energy contained within the jet cone as a function of r was then studied , fig .",
    "[ fig : jetres ] : left panel .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath675 ( 95)@xmath9 of the jet s energy is contained within r=0.4 ( 0.7 ) for jets with @xmath10@xmath6 20 gev / c .",
    "figure  [ fig : jetres]:left panel also shows that higher energy jets are focussed within smaller jet radii .",
    "the data are not yet corrected to the particle level and are therefore compared to pythia 6.410  @xcite , tuned to the cdf 1.96 tev data ( tune a ) , predictions passed through star s simulations and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "there is a shift of the reconstructed jet @xmath10to lower values caused by detector inefficiences and undetected particles such as the neutron and k@xmath11 .",
    "the single particle reconstruction efficiency in the tpc is @xmath6 80@xmath9 for @xmath10@xmath61 gev / c .",
    "the jet energy resolution was obtained via two techniques .",
    "the first used the pythia simulations to compare reconstructed jet energies at the particle and detector level .",

    "the uncorrected charged particle fragmentation functions ( ff ) for jets with @xmath10reconstructed in the range 20 - 30 gev / c are shown for jet resolution parameters r=0.4 , fig .  [ fig : ff04 ] , and r=0.7 , fig .",

    "there is reasonable agreement between the data and pythia , and the different jet algorithms ( shown as different colors and line types / shapes in the figures ) reconstruct the same ff within errors .",

    "the underlying event ( ue ) in a _",
    "p - p_collision is defined as everything but the hard scattering .",
    "thus , it has contributions from soft and semi - hard multiple parton interactions , initial and final state radiation and beam - beam remnants .",
    "pile - up is not included as part of the ue . since this study",
    "is performed at mid - rapidity the beam - beam contribution is minimal . to study the ue we follow the cdf technique  @xcite .",
    "first the jets are reconstructed , next each event is split into four sections defined by their azimuthal angle with respect to the leading jet axis ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the range within @xmath19@xmath1660@xmath20 is the lead jet region and an away jet area is designated for @xmath19@xmath6120@xmath20 .",
    "this leaves two transverse sectors of @xmath21@xmath16@xmath18@xmath16120@xmath20 and @xmath22@xmath16@xmath18@xmath16 - 60@xmath20 .",
    "one is called the transmax region and is the transverse sector containing the largest charged particle multiplicity .",
    "the second sector is termed the transmin region .",
    "two analyses are then performed , a ",
    "leading \" jet study , where at least one jet is found in star s acceptance , and a  back - to - back \" study which is a sub - set of the  leading \" jet collection .",
    "this sub - set of events has two ( and only two ) found jets with @xmath23@xmath60.7 and @xmath24@xmath6150@xmath20 , this selection suppresses hard initial and final state radiation of the scattered parton .",
    "the transmax region has an enhanced probability of containing contributions from these hard initial and final state radiation components .",
    "thus , by comparing the transmax and transmin regions in the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" sets we can extract information about the various components in the ue .    , using siscone algorithm , r=0.7 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : ue ] shows the measured charged particle density in the ue .",
    "the first observation is that the ue is largely independent of the jet energy .",
    "the second is that the densities are the same within errors for the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" datasets .",
    "this again suggests that the hard scattered partons emit very small amounts of large angle initial / final state radiation at rhic energies .",
    "this is very different in 1.96 tev collisions where the  leading\"/back - to - back \" density ratio is @xmath120.65  @xcite .",
    "the two solid lines show the expected density if events follow a poisson distribution with an average of 0.36 .",
    "the similarity of this simple simulation to the data suggests that at rhic energies the splitting of the measured transmax and transmin values is predominantly due to the sampling .",
    "pythia again shows satisfactory agreement with the data .",
    "in summary , jet fragmentation functions have been measured in _",
    "p - p_collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev and will provide a stringent baseline for the measurements underway in au - au collisions .",
    "pythia , tuned to 1.96 tev data , shows reasonable agreement suggesting that the energy dependence of the underlying physics is well modeled .",
    "finally , the ue is largely independent of the momentum transfer of hard scattering and receives only minor contributions from radiation from this scattering .",
