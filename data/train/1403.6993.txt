    "kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is the hole - doped end member of the well - studied ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath0as@xmath0 family of iron based superconductors  @xcite and it features superconductivity at @xmath5 without the need for application of external pressure  @xcite .",
    "this material is presently under debate since the origin of the superconducting phase and the pairing symmetry are still unclear  @xcite , both on the experimental and theoretical sides : recent laser - based angle - resolved photoemission ( laser arpes ) measurements found the superconducting order parameter to be of @xmath6-wave character with octet line - nodes  @xcite , while a theoretical study  @xcite based of functional renormalization group considerations predicted a @xmath7-wave symmetry in agreement with measurements of thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "however , other theoretical studies  @xcite based on spin pairing theory within the random phase approximation found that @xmath6- and @xmath7-wave pairing channels are strong competitors in electron - doped fe - based systems and , therefore , both are possible in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "transport measurements under pressure  @xcite suggested the presence of a possible phase transition from @xmath7-wave to @xmath6-wave around @xmath8  gpa .    also , strikingly , quantum oscillation experiments  @xcite predicted effective charge carrier masses of up to @xmath9 with an average mass enhancement factor @xmath10 of about 9 , while estimates from arpes  @xcite and cyclotron resonance experiments  @xcite yield mass enhancements factors of about 3 for certain regions of the fermi surface . on the theoretical side , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 show poor agreement to arpes data  @xcite and to de haas - van alphen frequencies  @xcite .",
    "however , an existing dft+dmft study  @xcite for kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 suggested an improved comparison of the fermi surface contour at @xmath11=0 with arpes observations .",
    "the importance of correlations in fe - based superconductors has been pointed out in the past by numerous studies .",
    "a method that has proven to be quite successful in capturing the essential features of this class of correlated metals is dft+dmft  @xcite .",
    "since an accurate knowledge of the electronic structure is essential for understanding both the normal and the superconducting state in fe - based superconductors , we perform here a comprehensive lda+dmft investigation focused on features of the kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound that have not been dealt with in past studies@xcite .",
    "we critically benchmark our theoretical results with arpes and dhva measurements to see in which way these results can improve our current understanding of this system .",
    "we combine density functional theory with dynamical mean - field theory in order to investigate the electronic structure and the resulting dhva frequencies of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "our calculations are based on the experimentally determined tetragonal @xmath12 structures of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 by tafti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which are given for pressure values starting at 0.23  gpa .",
    "we obtained a structure at zero pressure by linear extrapolation of the available data points .",
    "a comparison of this structure to the existing crystal structure by rosza and schuster  @xcite used in previous theoretical investigations , shows that while lattice parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are consistent , the as  @xmath16 position differs significantly between both structures .",
    "the as  @xmath16 position was consistently determined over a large pressure range in the above mentioned study by tafti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and the as  @xmath16 position determined by rosza and schuster does nt follow the trend shown by those data .",
    "therefore we use the new structure with the following parameters : @xmath17   , @xmath18   , fractional as  @xmath19 .    for the dft calculation we employed the full - potential linear augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) framework as implemented in wien2k  @xcite , using the local density approximation ( lda ) as well as the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite to the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "these calculations were converged self - consistently on a grid of 726 @xmath20 points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "we performed calculations both , without and with inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ( so ) .    in order to include the effect of local correlations we employed fully charge self - consistent dmft calculations , using modified routines from the wien2k code .",
    "we considered our implementation of the projection method from bloch eigenstates to the correlated fe @xmath1 orbitals as described by aichhorn _",
    "et al . _",
    "the energy window for the projection onto the localized basis was chosen comparatively large , ranging from @xmath21  ev to @xmath22  ev to capture the higher energy contribution of the fe @xmath1 orbitals to the density of states arising from the hybridization with the as @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "the dmft impurity problem was solved using the continuous - time hybridization expansion quantum monte carlo solver in imaginary frequency space as implemented in the alps  @xcite code .",
    "we considered the legendre polynomial representation  @xcite of the green s function and improved estimators for the self - energy  @xcite .",
    "about @xmath24 monte - carlo sweeps were performed at an inverse temperature @xmath25  ev@xmath26 , corresponding to room temperature .",
    "the interaction parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 were chosen as @xmath29  ev and @xmath30  ev in terms of slater integrals and for the double - counting correction we used the fully - localized limit ( fll ) .",
    "all orbital characters presented here are defined in a coordinate system which is rotated by @xmath31 around the crystallographic @xmath16 axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 are pointing along fe - fe nearest neighbor bonds . for determining the lda+dmft excitation energies that we used to define the fermi surface , we tracked the maximum of the real - frequency spectral function throughout the brillouin - zone .",
    "analytic continuation of imaginary frequency data to the real frequency axis was performed by using the pad approximation for the impurity self - energy and we checked the results against the stochastic maximum entropy method  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional cuts through the fermi surface were extracted from wien2k on @xmath34 @xmath20 point grids for the lda calculations .",
    "the fermi surface was interpolated linearly .",
    "de haas - van alphen frequencies were calculated from the electronic band structure using our own implementation of the dhva frequency extraction algorithm by rourke and julian  @xcite .",
    "band energies were extracted on grids spanning the reciprocal unit cell with 27648 @xmath20 points for the dft(+so ) setups and 50000 @xmath20 points for the dmft calculations .",
    "the frequency calculation was carried out on a @xmath35 @xmath20 point supercell grid containing 64 reciprocal unit cells .",
    "the higher @xmath20 point density in the supercell compared to the input files is achieved by tricubic interpolation  @xcite .",
    "we align the supercell with a fictitious magnetic field vector , which allows us to investigate the angular dependence of dhva frequencies . here",
    "we varied the angle of the magnetic field from the ( 001 ) towards the ( 010 ) direction in reciprocal space . in order to calculate frequencies ,",
    "the supercell is cut into one @xmath20 point thick slices perpendicular to the vector of the magnetic field . on these slices",
    "a stepping algorithm detects crossings of the fermi level between grid points and interpolates the position of the fermi surface linearly .",
    "point ordering is ensured within the stepping algorithm .",
    "if a closed orbit is detected , its area can be calculated from the geometry of the points unambiguously .",
    "the three - dimensional fermi surface is reconstructed by matching orbits slice - by - slice .",
    "only extremal orbits are singled out since non - extremal orbits do not contribute in experiment .",
    "de haas - van alphen frequencies are calculated for the extremal orbits and their positions are matched back to the reciprocal unit cell .",
    "orbits with similar position and frequency are averaged .",
    "and @xmath36 in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 obtained from dft using the lda exchange correlation functional with and without spin - orbit coupling ( so ) .",

    "the two outer hole pockets form cylinders between the @xmath37 and @xmath2 points , while the cylinder of the third inner hole pocket closes shortly before @xmath2 .",

    ", we observe very small hole pockets with fe @xmath38 , @xmath41 character , where the bands with mostly fe @xmath41 character are very shallow right above @xmath43 , which leads to a high sensibility to input parameters and total electron charge in the calculation .    by including the spin - orbit interaction we observe an overall repulsion between touching or degenerate bands , which leads to clear separation of the hole pockets along the high symmetry directions ( see fig .

    "fig : fsoverview ] ( c ) , ( d ) ) .    comparing these dft results",
