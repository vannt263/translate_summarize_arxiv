    "radio quiet and radio loud ( not blazar ) quasars ( rqq and rlq , respectively ) have similar spectral properties in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and infrared ( ir ) , but their radio powers differ by several orders of magnitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "this divergence takes place at millimetre ( mm ) wavelengths . at these wavelengths the contribution from two emission components merge , namely the synchrotron emission dominant in the radio domain and thermal emission from cool dust ( 30 - 50 k ) in the far - ir ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is still not entirely clear whether the distinction between rlq and rqq is a consequence of differences in their central engines or whether it merely reflects differences in their environments .",
    "the primary observational distinctions in the ir domain , and the proposed physical mechanisms to explain them are studied here , using the new insights provided by infrared space observatory ( iso ; @xcite ) measurements .",
    "two main types of rlq can be distinguished on the basis of their radio spectrum : the flat spectrum radio loud quasars ( fsrq ) , and the steep spectrum radio loud quasars ( ssrq ) .",
    "fsrq show highly - collimated structures and very compact features , with flat or inverted radio spectra .",
    "ssrq have radio spectra dominated by synchrotron emission from extended radio lobes .",
    "the lobes and a radio core in the centre of these objects are signs of a relativistic jet . according to the unified scheme ( @xcite ;  @xcite )",
    "fsrq are the counterparts of ssrq in which the jet is aimed at the observer .",
    "the origin of the much weaker radio emission in rqq is far less certain .",
    "the majority of the total radio emission from the rqq comes from the compact features in the nucleus ( @xmath1 1 kpc for unresolved regions , and at least 2 kpc for the resolved ones ) rather than the body of the host galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the activity in rqq is supplied by a starburst , i.e. thermal bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission coming from strongly radiative supernov and supernov remnants ( snrs ) in a very dense environment where shocks accelerate electrons ( @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the energy supply arises from accretion onto a massive black hole , the radio emission from rqq ( as in rlq ) is caused by radio jets , but the bulk kinetic power of these jets is for some reason @xmath2 10@xmath3 times lower than those of rlq ( @xcite ) .",
    "this second hypothesis seems to be favored by recent studies , because of high brightness temperatures calculated ( typical sn / snrs have t@xmath4k ) , by the evidence of a pc - scale jet ( @xcite ) and by observations of flat / inverted and variable radio spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , quasars with intermediate radio luminosities have been discovered and labeled radio intermediate quasars ( riq ) ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "riq may represent the doppler boosted counterparts of radio quiet quasars .",
    "this hypothesis is suggested by the variability observed at radio wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a dominant thermal ( circumnuclear dust emission ) , or non - thermal ( synchrotron radiation from the agn ) component in the ir continuum of quasars is still debated .",
    "many attempts to establish the origin of the ir emission in rlq and rqq have been performed through observations in the sub - millimetre ( sub - mm ) of quasars detected by iras ( rlq in @xcite , and @xcite ; rqq in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; and both in @xcite , this last work is the only one based on an optically selected sample ) .",
    "the main test applied to recognize the presence of thermal emission in the ir spectra of the objects was based on the slope of the continuum emission ( f@xmath5 ) connecting the far - ir and sub - mm data .",
    "a steep , @xmath6 2.5 , continuum is strong evidence for thermal dust emission .",
    "most of the sources studied have @xmath7 2.5 and are consistent with a dominant self - absorbed synchrotron emission component .",
    "however , some rqq have spectral slopes as steep as @xmath8 = 4.35 , which , along with observations of strong molecular gas ( co ) emission ( @xcite ) , give strong support to a thermal mechanism as the origin of the far - ir component in rqq .    among the rlq",
    ", @xmath8 is , at most , @xmath9 0.9 for the fsrq , and 1.1 for the ssrq ( @xcite ) .",
    "variability , shape of the continuum spectral energy distribution and , in some cases polarization , indicate that the radio , mm and far - ir emission of fsrq is dominated by the synchrotron process ( @xcite ) . on the contrary ,",
    "many ssrq show evidence of thermal emission : their far - ir spectra are brighter than extensions of the radio emission ( @xcite ) , suggesting a different origin than the non - thermal radio component ; and the flux is constant , consistent with it arising from a region much larger than a light year ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral energy distributions of some rlq , both fsrq and ssrq , show evidence for a galaxy component : reddening , residual starlight , molecular gas ( @xcite ) , and some thermal dust emission in the near - ir ( @xcite ) . both components , non - thermal synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission , are probably present at ir wavelengths , as observed in the rlq 3c273 ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "a tight , linear correlation is observed between the far - ir flux and the radio fluxes in agn ( @xcite ) , suggesting a common origin .",
    "rqq and rlq occupy well defined regions in log(@xmath10(ir))log(@xmath10(radio ) ) space , and show a relation with a similar slope , just shifted to higher radio power by a factor @xmath210@xmath11 in rlq .",
    "rqq show a similar relation as spirals , starbursts , and ultra luminous ir galaxies ( ulirg ) , suggesting that their ir emission may arise from sufficiently energetic star formation in the host galaxy ( @xcite )",
    ". however , the majority of the bolometric luminosity in over half of known ulirg seems to arise from a buried agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the variable and flat spectra , and high brightness temperatures shown by many rqq at radio frequencies ( @xcite ) suggest that the radio emission is related to the agn rather than to a starburst .",
    "the unified model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) predicts that similar disk  like dust distributions exist in both rqq and rlq .",
    "orientation of the active nucleus , environment , and jet luminosity all affect the relative contributions of thermal and non - thermal sources to the observed infrared luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "other scenarios have been proposed to explain the large differences in radio power between rqq and rlq : different spin of the central black hole ( @xcite ) , or different morphological type of the host galaxy .",
    "indeed , different radio powers are expected if one population of objects is fueled by mergers ( ellipticals ) and one is fueled by mostly internal processes within the galaxy ( spirals ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent studies on the host galaxies of quasars indicate that the host galaxies of rqq are in several cases elliptical and not always spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .      a better knowledge of the radio and ir properties of quasars is required to test the unified model predictions , and answer the following questions :    1 .",
    "what is the dominant mechanism emitting at ir wavelengths in rlq and rqq ? 2 .",
    "do rlq and rqq have the same dust properties ( temperature , source size , mass , and luminosity ) ? 3 .",
    "does an interplay between the radio and the ir components exist ?",
    "these questions can be addressed through the study of the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of rlq and rqq . here , we present the seds from radio to ir frequencies of a sample of 22 agn ( 7 rqq , 11 rlq , 2 radio galaxies ( rg ) and 2 riq ) . the selected sample , even if incomplete and heterogeneous , is useful to address these questions thanks to several properties characterizing the sample ( steep / flat radio spectra , radio loudness / quietness ) , and to the large amount of photometric data available in the radio , mm / sub - mm and ir domains .",
    "this work is based mainly on ir data provided by iso .",
    "iso data reduce the frequency gap between sub - mm and far - ir observations , better sample the ir spectral band with a larger number of filters than previous instruments , and increase the number of detected objects thanks to a higher sensitivity .",
    "the study of the ir emission of quasars will be extended in the future with the results of the european and of the u.s .",

    "the last steps of the data reduction before determining the source flux are the background subtraction , the deletion of remaining highly discrepant points , and the correction for effects depending on chopper plateau time , vignetting ( only for chopper observations ) and point spread function .    in the case of chopper observations with the c100 detector",
    "only the central pixel pointed on the source is considered to derive the flux density , since the eight border pixels contain only a small fraction of the central point source and summing these values would hence only increase the noise .      in chopper observations",
    "the background is measured at each off - source position . since in some cases",
    "the instruments show long term drift effects , the background signal is estimated near the time of each on - source measurement and subtracted . in the case of chopper observations",
    "the background estimates are obtained by computing the weighted mean of each pair of consecutive off - source measurements .",
    "the weights are computed from pia statistical uncertainties . since the sequence of chopper plateaux ends with an on - source position , we used the weighted mean of the two last on - source measurements , and the flux observed in the last off - source position to determine the last pair of on- and off - source values , for a total of 2@xmath36 flux values .",
    "small maps of the regions immediately surrounding ten of the targets were constructed in one or both of the following ways ( fig .",
    "[ figrastmod ] ) : multiple linear scans across the source and rastering the detector about the source .",
    "a scan with the p1 and c100 detectors consisted of three steps of the telescope , with this sequence repeated three times . only the middle row of c100 pixels ( 8 , 5 , and 2 , as depicted in fig .  [ figrastmod ] ) viewed the source .",
    "the c200 scans contained four steps , repeated twice , with the source centered between two pixels .",
    "note that the source was observed in only the middle two steps of the c200 scan .",
    "the raster patterns were 3@xmath263 , 3@xmath263 , and 4@xmath262 or 2@xmath264 , for the p1 , c100 , and c200 detectors , respectively .",
    "each pixel viewed the source once in the raster maps .",
    "the step size between exposures for both scans and rasters was approximately equal to the pixel size , a little more to take into account the gap between pixels , for the c100 and c200 cameras , and equal to the aperture size for the p1 detectors , which resulted in a different total sky coverage for each detector ( see table  [ detprop ] ) .",
    "a background estimate for each on - source measurement was obtained from a weighted average of the flux measured in the raster or scan positions immediately preceding and following the source position by the same pixel . using the same pixel to determine the background reduced the impact of uncertainties in the flat field .",
    "the weighted average background was subtracted from each on - source measurement providing a sequence of source flux values .",
    "residual effects of detector instabilities , in both chopper observations and maps , produced occasional discrepant points , which were culled by one - pass sigma clipping . the threshold number of standard deviations to reject a flux value depended on the number of points in the sequence ( chauvenet s criterion in taylor ( 1982 ) ) , ranging from 1.15@xmath25 to 2.66@xmath25 .    in the case of chopper observations with the c200 camera , the source flux was computed by adding together the fluxes measured by each of the four pixels .",
    "the source flux was divided between pairs of adjoining pixels in the c200 scans ; these were averaged by weighting with their uncertainties .",
    "table  [ detobsrast ] lists the weighted mean of each flux sequence after clipping , or 3@xmath25 upper limits for non  detection , where @xmath25 is the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties ( see section  [ syst_unc ] ) , also reported in the tables .      in the case of chopper observations with the c100 and c200 detectors ,",
    "the data are further corrected for the signal loss outside the beam of the telescope ( vignetting ) .",
    "the pia default vignetting correction factors were computed considering the dependency only on the distance of the chopper positions and on the filter , but recent investigations have shown that they depend also on the time per chopper plateau ( m. haas , private communication ) .",
    "the pia default vignetting factors were applied directly to the data , resulting in little change to the flux values obtained with the c100 camera .",
    "however , the fluxes from the c200 detector are @xmath2 80% , in median , larger after the vignetting correction . given the uncertainty over the accuracy of the vignetting factors , we averaged the fluxes derived with and without the correction and added the respective uncertainties in quadrature .      in the case of chopper observations",
    "a correction for the signal loss due to effects depending on the time per chopper plateau is applied to the computed flux value . since short integration times with the c100 and c200 detectors",
    "do not reach the full signal , the observed flux can be reduced by large factors , typically up to 68 % for the c100 detector , and up to 12% for the c200 detector for the shortest observations .",
    "the correction factors we use are the pia default values .",
    "all the computed fluxes are finally corrected for the point spread function ( psf ) of each detector using the default pia values derived empirically in most of the cases .",
    "the available psf correction values correspond to a source position centered in a pixel or located in a corner of the pixel . in case of scans with the c200 detector we needed the psf correction corresponding to the target located in the middle of a side of the pixel .",
    "we derived it by assuming a bi - dimensional gaussian function for the psf and constraining its parameters using the other two known values for each wavelength ( 30.6% at 150 @xmath23 m , and 29.1% at 170 @xmath23 m ) .      during the data reduction",
    "only statistical errors were taken into account , and not those in the absolute flux density calibration .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute photometric calibration depends mainly on systematic errors ( detector transient effects , calibration response , dark current , point spread function ) , and it is currently known to be better than 30% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the associated statistical and systematic uncertainties are reported in the last two columns of table  [ detobschop ] and  [ detobsrast ] .",
    "we associate to the measured flux an uncertainty that is the quadratic sum of their statistical uncertainties and 30% ( for the c200 measurements obtained in chopper mode we use 40% that corresponds to half of the uncertainty due to the vignetting correction ) of the measured value . among our isophot observations the datasets of b2 1721 + 34 were identified as failed after inspection of their quality by the iso team because they were heavily affected by cosmic rays and thus scientifically useless .",

    "( 1998 ) , to which we added data in the radio ( @xcite ;  @xcite ;  white & becker 1992 ) and in the soft x - ray energy domains ( @xcite ) in the case of rqq , and the template of a giant elliptical galaxy ( @xcite ) in the case of rlq , riq and rg .",
    "the reported host galaxy template was not modified by any normalization . in many cases",
    "this is orders of magnitude below the observed luminosities , and even if it is shifted towards higher luminosities to reach the quasar sed , it will remain below at most frequencies .",
    "the ir emission can have a thermal or non - thermal origin .",
    "several investigation methods can be applied to identify the emission process :    1 .   the value of the slope of the sub - mm / far - ir spectral break can discriminate between optically - thick ( self - absorbed ) synchrotron and thermal emission from dust grains .",
    "the self - absorbed synchrotron model is characterized by a maximum value of the sub - mm / far - ir slope that is 2.5 ( f@xmath5 ) , if the radiation is emitted by an electron population with a simple power - law energy distribution , or somewhat larger ( @xmath44 3 ) if a thermal electron pool or dual power - law energy distribution is invoked ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in either case the maximum synchrotron slope is attained only for a completely homogeneous source , otherwise it will be lower .",
    "the asymptotic thermal sub - mm / far - ir slope is expected to be @xmath45 3 since the optically thin thermal spectrum derives from rayleigh - jeans law with an additional parameter dependent on frequency , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , the dust optical depth , is @xmath48 with @xmath4912 ( see section  [ model_ir ] ) .",
    "a non - thermal origin of the ir emission is indicated if relatively short time scale flux variability is observed , since a synchrotron component is expected to come from a very compact source .",
    "most of the dust emission comes from an extended source with a long variability time scale .",
    "a thermal origin can be attributed to the ir emission if a non - varying excess from any reasonable extrapolation from the radio domain in the plot @xmath42 versus @xmath43 is observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to distinguish the origin of the ir emission based on brightness temperature ( @xcite ) and polarization measurements , but the lack of these kind of data for the sample does not allow us to apply them .",
    "the first test will prove the thermal origin of the far - ir emission only if the coldest dust component is also the brightest one .",
    "colder and less bright dust components will flatten the sub - mm / far - ir spectral slope .",
    "two sources in the sample , pg 1543 + 489 and 3c 405 , have a sub - mm / far - ir spectral index larger than 2.5 .",
    "their far - ir emission is therefore dominated by thermal radiation .",
    "the remaining sources have insufficient data at long wavelengths to constrain the sub - mm / far - ir spectral slope .",
    "the observation of no variability is not conclusive , while if a flux variation is observed the non - thermal hypothesis will be strongly supported .",
    "this method can be applied only to those sources that were observed several times . in our sample , at least two ir observations ( iras and isophot , or several isophot observations ) at different epochs are available for ten sources ( 3c 47 , pks 0637@xmath14752 , pg 1100 + 772 , pg 1543 + 489 , pg 1718 + 481 , b2 1721 + 481 , hs 1946 + 7658 , 3c 405 , b2 2201 + 31a , and pg 2214 + 139 ) ( see fig .",

    "the third test is the simplest , and it can be applied to the whole sample since a broad spectral coverage from radio to the ir is available for all the sources . before applying this test",

    "the orientation of the beamed emission can be estimated from the radio core fraction r. this quantity , defined as the ratio between the core radio luminosity and the luminosity of the extended radio emission at 59 ghz in the rest frame , serves as an orientation indicator of the radio source with respect to the observer , measuring the relative strength of the core component ( @xcite ) .",
    "the core flux was not available for three ssrq and one rg , thus the parameter r was not computed . in the case of fsrq",

    "this difference permits us to estimate the enhancement factor of the beamed emission after a few considerations .",
    "first , the observed radio emission in rlq is mainly produced by the jet and its core rather than a starburst , since star - emitting ulirg have much lower radio luminosity than rlq ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , we assume that the radio source is intrinsically identical in fsrq and ssrq , and that the difference in their radio emission is due only to the orientation of the beamed emission .",

    "the orientation effect is more important in the radio domain , as shown by the stronger correlation , than in the soft x - ray , and negligible in the ir .",
    "this implies that the radio core and a fraction of the total emitted soft x - ray luminosities are emitted anisotropically .",
    "we furthermore verified that r is not correlated with the redshift and thus that the above result is not an artifact of distance related biases in the measurement of r.    assuming that the soft x - ray source is intrinsically identical in fsrq and ssrq , the observed difference in l(sx ) arises from the orientation of the fraction , @xmath108 , that is beamed .",
    "if the fraction of emitted radiation that is beamed is enhanced by a factor a , identical to that of the radio emission , the following relation between the soft x - ray luminosity in fsrq and that in ssrq will be valid : @xmath109 using the average value of the ratio @xmath110 that is @xmath111 , and the range of values obtained for the factor @xmath102 , we derive a fraction @xmath112 312% for the beamed fraction of the soft x - ray component .",
    "the radio and the soft x - ray luminosities are mainly produced by the agn component ( see sections  [ avgsedpar ] and  [ orient ] ) .",
    "the comparison between the luminosities emitted in the radio and soft x - ray domains is then equivalent to a comparison of the agn power in the two types of quasars .",
    "the radio core emission of ssrq is on average 200 times higher than that of rqq ( see fig .  [ hist_jet ] ) and the soft x - ray luminosity is on average 8 times higher in ssrq than in rqq ( see fig .",
    "[ hist_sx ] ) .",
    "since the ssrq show luminosities higher than rqq not only at radio and soft x - ray energies , but also in the hard x - ray domain ( @xcite ) , we argue that the bolometric agn luminosity is much higher in ssrq than in rqq .",
    "the difference in the agn power should be observable at all frequencies where the agn emission dominates .",
    "we have already pointed out the similarity in ir luminosities and spectra of ssrq and rqq ( see figs .  [ avg_sed ] and  [ hist_ir ] ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that the origin of the dominant ir component is not agn - related .",
    "the candidate is then a starburst .",
    "some indication of the dominant ir emission mechanism can be gleaned from the shape of the sed .",
    "an agn can emit a significant fraction , often a majority , of its infrared luminosity at shorter wavelengths , @xmath50 @xmath1 60@xmath23 m , as long as the obscuring columns are not so large as to be optically thick at these wavelengths .",
    "starburst dominated galaxies , on the other hand , produce the bulk of their infrared emission at @xmath50 @xmath51 60@xmath23 m .",
    "the ratio of the luminosities in these two wavelength regimes , @xmath10(60 - 200@xmath23m)/@xmath10(3 - 60@xmath23 m ) , thus provides a rough estimate of the primary driver of the infrared component .",

    "[ hist_sb_agn ] , in which only the sources having at least two grey body components with t @xmath1 1000 k are included . for comparison ,",
    "the luminosity ratio from an average sed of low reddening starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) is also indicated .",
    "all of the agn in the sample have infrared luminosity ratios less than the starburst fiducial value ( = 0.76 ) by a factor or four or more ( the maximum ratio is 0.20 corresponding to 27% of starburst contribution ) , suggesting that the infrared in these sources is dominated by the central engine . the rqq and ssrq have similar average ratios , 8% of the total ir emission is produced by a starburst .    since the dominant ir source is the agn , which differs in ssrq and rqq",
    ", other factors have to be taken into account to explain the similarity of their ir luminosities and average spectra .",
    "these factors can be the dust covering factor , its amount and geometric distribution . a higher dust covering factor in rqq , due to larger total dust mass and/or a particular geometric distribution , may account for the similar ir radiation .",
    "aspects of this hypothesis are attractive , since the presence of more circumnuclear material may be related to the physical conditions that hinder the jet formation and/or development in rqq . however ,",
    "if larger dust covering factors were present in rqq , a higher probability to observe a rqq through optically thick dust would be expected and a large fraction of rqq with absorption features in the soft x - ray would be observed .",
    "observations do not support these predictions ( see section  [ dataset ] ) .",
    "moreover , the similarity in the observed ir luminosities and spectra requires a fine tuning between the dust heating source , the dust amount and its geometric distribution , which makes this explanation improbable .",
    "we propose another scenario in which the dust properties ( amount and distribution ) and the heating source are similar in ssrq and rqq .",
    "the dust distribution contributing in the far - ir probably extends from the more external regions of the agn , and is predominantly heated by the optical and uv radiation fields filling these external regions which are similar in both classes . at relatively large distances from the centre ,",
    "the agn components are similar in both types of quasars , towards the innermost regions , where the soft x - rays are emitted and a jet is formed , ssrq and rqq become different .",
    "the high energy photons escape from the centre without significant dust absorption and provide an important probe of the central radiation source .",
    "observations indicate that the soft x - ray radiation is higher in ssrq ( see fig .",
    "[ avg_sed ] ) in agreement with the proposed scenario .    from this analysis",
    "it is suggested that the main difference between rqq , and ssrq takes place in the innermost nuclear regions where the emitted power is higher in ssrq than in rqq , while the agn external regions ( dust distribution and optical / uv source ) have similar properties in both types of quasars .",
    "since fsrq and ssrq show similar properties in the ir , once the non - thermal contribution is subtracted , this conclusion can be also extended to fsrq .",
    "continuum observations from radio to soft x - ray energies have been presented for a sample of 22 quasars characterized by different degrees of radio emission .",
    "the ir data were obtained with isophot and irac1 , and the mm data with iram , sest and scuba .",
    "further ir and mm data , and some radio and soft x - ray fluxes , were drawn from the literature .",
    "the availability of a broad band sed for several types of quasars allows us to separate the dominant spectral components in the radio and ir energy bands , and thus to compare their spectral properties in different types of quasars . the spectral analysis and",

    "a starburst contributes to the ir emission at different levels , but always less than the agn ( @xmath027% ) .",
    "the presence of thermal ir emission in fsrq remains rather uncertain . among the three fsrq of the sample we can not derive any conclusion for two of them , and for a third one ( b2 2201 + 31a ) the observed data suggest a dominant thermal component at @xmath114 m .",
