    "the understanding of early times dynamics is one of the most interesting and compelling problems of heavy ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energy . according to the standard picture of such collision processes , immediately after the collision an ensemble of strong longitudinal color electric and color magnetic coherent fields known as glasma",
    "is produced @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities in the glasma fields are amplified by plasma instabilities , which eventually lead to loss of coherence of the color fields and to a locally isotropized particle plasma @xcite .",
    "recently the early isotropization problem has been studied also by means of ads / cft methods @xcite .    besides plasma instabilities , a mechanism responsible for the initial field decays is the one introduced by schwinger in the context of quantum electrodynamics @xcite , known as the schwinger effect which consists in a vacuum instability towards the creation of particle pairs by a strong electric field , and it is related to the existence of an imaginary part in the quantum effective action of a pure electric field ,",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the problem of pair formation in strong electric fields has been considered recently by means of real time lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover non abelian generalizations of the schwinger production rate has been found for the case of both static and time dependent field  @xcite . in the context of quark - gluon plasma physics",
    "it has been considered as a mechanism for the color field decays in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to model early times dynamics of the system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions by an initial color electric field which then decays to a plasma by the schwinger effect .",
    "the focus of our study is to compute quantities which serve as indicators of thermalization and isotropization of the plasma . in particular , we couple the dynamical evolution of the color field to the dynamics of the many particles system produced by the decay , the latter being described by relativistic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "as in the previous studies on this subject we assume that the dynamics of the color field is abelian , hence it satisfies the classical field maxwell equations , see @xcite for a review .",
    "moreover in the present approach we neglect for simplicity initial longitudinal color magnetic fields which are present in the more complete description of the glasma state .",
    "we consider two simple cases : the first one is a system evolving in a static box ; then we consider a system with a longitudinal expansion which has a greater physical interest than the static box because it is closer to the picture of the early times dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions .    besides being the first study in which a monte carlo method is used to simulate the schwinger effect in the context of early times dynamics of high energy collisions , we improve previous studies which mainly rely on relaxation time approximation ( rta ) @xcite or on a linearization of the conductive electric current @xcite , by avoiding any ansatz both on the electric current and on the collision integral in the boltzmann equation which permits to go beyond the rta .",
    "the approach developed here , based on a stochastic solution of the relativistic boltzman equation , has in perspective the advantage to be easily extended to @xmath6d realistic simulations , allowing to study the possible impact of the early dynamics on observables like radial and elliptic flow  @xcite .    in both the cases of the static box and of the longitudinal expanding system we have focused on the calculation of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the longitudinal and transverse pressures respectively . for the particular initial field configuration used in this work , namely an electric field along the longitudinal direction",
    ", one has @xmath10 ; however the field decays onto particles thanks to the schwinger effect and particle dynamics removes this initial anisotropy , the efficiency of isotropization being related to the coupling among the particles . in our simulations we fix the ratio @xmath0 where @xmath11 is the shear viscosity and @xmath12 the entropy density , and compute locally the corresponding cross section by means of the chapman - enskog ( ce ) approximation @xcite .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath0 the system is less efficient in removing the initial anisotropy in agreement with previous studies , although regardless of @xmath0 the longitudinal pressure becomes positive within a small fraction of fm / c , @xmath13 fm / c ; moreover for large values of @xmath0 we find persistent oscillations of the color field which affects the evolution of physical quantities like @xmath7 and the proper energy density , in agreement with @xcite . even if we go beyond the rta we find that only the early times evolution is affected , leaving the main behaviours very mildly affected .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review briefly the abelian flux tube model which we implement in our simulations . in section",
    "iii we review relativistic transport theory . in section",
    "iv we present our results of the simulations for the case of a static box . in section",
    "v we discuss in detail our results for the case of a box with a longitudinal expansion . finally in section vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the abelian flux tube model ( aftm ) @xcite which we implement in our simulations of the initial stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the present study we do not insist on implementing the most realistic geometrical condition relevant for heavy ion collisions experiments , in which one should take into account several flux tubes in the transverse plane similar to the glasma configuration ; rather we consider a simpler situation in which there is only one flux tube of a given transverse area , and study its dynamical evolution by coupling the field equations to relativistic kinetic theory for the particle quanta produced by the decay of the field itself , leaving to upcoming works the study of more realistic initial conditions .",
    "the main assumptions of the aftm are :    * in the initial condition a color electric field is present , which is produced by color charges in the colliding nuclei ; * the color electric field decays into particle quanta by the schwinger mechanism ; * the particle quanta propagate in the medium colliding and interacting with the background of the color field ; * particle creation as well as particle currents affect in a self - consistent way the color electric field ; * the field dynamics is abelian , namely it satisfies the abelian maxwell equations .    the last assumption is quite strong because initial gauge fields are quite large , nevertheless it permits the easiest implementation of the coupling of classical field equations to relativistic kinetic theory in presence of the schwinger mechanism , hence we will limit ourselves to consider abelian dynamics of the classical fields leaving the introduction of non abelian field dynamics to future works .",
    "we will discuss more about kinetic theory in the next section , therefore in this section we mainly focus on the schwinger mechanism which is responsible for particle production in the early stage of the collision , and on the monte carlo implementation we use to simulate the schwinger effect .    in this section",
    "we closely follow @xcite at the same time adopting a slightly different notation which is more convenient for this article . moreover , since the very beginning we assume the initial color field to be polarized along the @xmath14 direction of adjoint color space , meaning that only one particular color charge is present in the two colliding nuclei  @xcite .",
    "moreover we assume only one component of the electric field is present , namely the one in the longitudinal direction , which we denote by @xmath15 in the following .",
    "the latter is a consequence of the fact that in the initial condition we assume the field is purely longitudinal , and transverse currents are not produced during time evolution of the system if transverse expansion does not take place implying a vanishing transverse field .",
    "the number of pairs per unit of spacetime and invariant momentum space produced by the decay of the electric field by the schwinger effect is ( we assume massles quanta throughout this article ) @xmath16 with @xmath17 the plus ( minus ) sign corresponding to the creation of a boson ( fermion - antifermion ) pair . in this equation @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 refer to each of the two particles created by the tunneling process ; @xmath20 is the effective force which acts on the tunneling pair and it depends on color and flavor ; it can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the string tension depending on the kind of flavor considered .",
    "moreover @xmath23 corresponds to the single particle kinetic energy .    the @xmath24 are color - flavor charges which , in the case of quarks , correspond to the eigenvalues of the @xmath25 operator : @xmath26 for antiquarks , corresponding to negative values of @xmath27 , the color - flavor charges are just minus the corresponding charges for quarks . finally for gluons ( which in our notation correspond to @xmath28 ) the charges are obtained by building gluons up as the octet of the @xmath29 in color space ; in particular @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the above charges are obtained easily @xcite : for example , the gluon we label with subscript @xmath2 can be represented , from the point of view of transformations in color space , as a red - antigreen state ; its @xmath25 charge is then given by difference of @xmath25 charges of a red and a green state .",
    "we notice that we have only six gluons out of eight , corresponding to the non - diagonal color generators ; the gluon fields corresponding to the diagonal color generators have vanishing coupling with the background field , hence they can not be produced by the schwinger effect .    as a final remark we would like to observe that",
    ", even if the model is named abelian , such nomenclature simply refers to the fact that in the evolution equation for the classical field , self - interacion terms coming from non vanishing structure constants of the color gauge group are neglected @xcite .",
    "however interactions among the classical field and gluons are still present in this calculations , thanks both to the schwinger effect which produces charged gluons , and to conduction currents which affect the evolution of the field , see the next section for more details .",
    "our calculation scheme is based on the relativistic transport boltzmann equation which , in the presence of a gauge field @xmath34 , can be written as follows : @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the distribution function for flavour @xmath27 and color @xmath37 , @xmath34 is the electromagnetic tensor . on the right hand side",
    "we have the source term @xmath38 which describes the creation of quarks , antiquarks and gluons due to the decay of the color electric field and @xmath39 $ ] which represents the collision integral . considering only @xmath40 body elastic scatterings ,",
    "the collision integral can be written as : @xmath41&= & \\int\\frac{d^3p_2}{2e_2(2\\pi)^3 }   \\frac{d^3p_{1^\\prime}}{2e_{1^\\prime}(2\\pi)^3 }   \\frac{d^3p_2^\\prime}{2e_2^\\prime(2\\pi)^3}\\ , ( f_{1^\\prime}f_{2^\\prime } - f_1 f_2)\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\times|{\\cal m}|^2\\delta^4(p_1 + p_2 - p_{1^\\prime } - p_{2^\\prime})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we omit flavour and color indices for simplicity , @xmath42 is the transition matrix for the elastic process linked to the differential cross section through @xmath43 , being @xmath12 the mandelstam variable .    in our simulations",
    "we solve numerically eq . ( [ boltzmann ] ) using the test particles method and the collision integral is computed using monte carlo methods based on the stochastic interpretation of transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the electric field is given by the maxwell equations : @xmath44 where @xmath45 corresponds to the color charge density , @xmath46 where @xmath47 denote flavor and color respectively ; the sum in the above equation runs over quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "on the other hand @xmath27 corresponds to the color electric current which is given by the sum of two contributions : in fact the schwinger effect can be described as a dielectric breakdown in which dipoles are produced by quantum tunneling hence changing the local dipole moment of the vacuum , and the charges move in the medium due to the residual electric field giving rise to a conductive current .",
    "following  @xcite we name displacement current , @xmath48 , and matter current , @xmath49 : @xmath50 here @xmath49 is a colored generalization of the usual electric current density which in a continuum notation is given by @xmath51 the displacement current arises from the polarization of the vacuum due to the decay of the electric field by the schwinger mechanism : more precisely it is given by the time derivative of the local dipole moment induced by the particles pop - up , in the same way a time variation of the local dipole moment in a medium gives rise to a change in the local electric field @xcite .",
    "according to the quantum tunneling interpretation of the schwinger effect  @xcite the dipole moment can be computed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 corresponds to the kinetic energy of the particles coming out from the vacuum ; taking into account eq .",
    "@xmath48 can be written , in the reference frame where particles are produced with vanishing longitudinal momentum , as @xmath54 where @xmath55 corresponds to the number of flavors in the calculation .",
    "the color charge and current densities depend on the particle distribution function : hence they link the maxwell equations   to the kinetic equation  .",
    "we solve self - consistently the field and kinetic equations : in this way we take into account the back reaction of particle production and propagation on the color field .    at variance with the standard use of transport theory , in which one fixes a set of microscopic processes into the collision integral , we have developed an approach that fixes the total cross section in order to have the wanted @xmath0 . by means of this scheme",
    "we are able to use the boltzmann equation to simulate the dynamical evolution of a fluid with specified shear viscosity , in analogy to what is done within hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we use the ce approach to relate shear viscosity to temperature , cross section and density which is in agreement with green - kubo correlator results @xcite .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath0 and compute the pertinent total cross section by mean of the relation @xmath56 which is valid for a generic differential cross section @xmath57 as proved in  @xcite . in the above equation @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the screening mass regulating the angular dependence of the cross section , while @xmath60\\ !",

    "the @xmath65 is the proper function accounting for the correct relaxation time @xmath66 associated to the shear viscosity transport coefficient . for isotropic cross section , i. e. @xmath67 ,",
    "the function @xmath65 is equal to @xmath68 and eq.([eq : sigmatt ] ) reduces to the relaxation time approximation with @xmath69 , while for finite value of @xmath59 , which means anisotropic scatterings , @xmath70 .",
    "we notice that , in the regime where viscous hydrodynamics applies , the specific microscopic details of the cross section are irrelevant , and our approach is an effective way to employ transport theory to simulate a fluid at a given @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the chromoelectric flux tube decay in a static box .",
    "we assume the box is a cube with side of @xmath71 fm .",
    "moreover we assume periodic boundary conditions for particles propagating in the box .",
    "this case is of academic interest , nevertheless it is useful because it allows us to introduce concepts which will be useful when we will consider more interesting case of a longitudinally expanding background , as well as it provides a further test of the numerical solution of eq .  .    given the symmetry of the problem , assuming at initial time a homogeneous electric field along the @xmath72 direction , then the system will remain homogeneous along the whole dynamical evolution : the electric field at later times as well as the currents and the invariant distribution functions will depend only on time and not on space coordinates .",
    "moreover it is easy to verify by maxwell equations that neither magnetic fields nor transverse components of the electric field can develop during the evolution . within these assumptions",
    "the evolution equation for the classical field relevant for our problem is given by @xmath73    in our simulations in the static box case we use eq .   to create particle pairs from the color electric field : at each time step ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 and of the volume box being given , we compute the expected pair number , @xmath74 , integrating eq .   over the volume box , then we distribute the @xmath74 pairs uniformly in the box and with transverse momentum @xmath18 according to the distribution in eq .  ; since the pairs have to pop out from the vacuum with vanishing total and longitudinal momenta , given @xmath18 we extract randomly the azimuthal angle @xmath75 which uniquely determines @xmath76 and @xmath77 of one of the particles in the pair ; finally the momentum direction of the second particle is given by @xmath78 .",

    "[ fig:2 ] we notice that for small coupling among the particles , the electric field rapidly decays through the schwinger mechanism then it evolves with damped oscillations : the smaller the coupling is , the less efficient the damping is . eventually for strong enough coupling",
    "the oscillations disappear and the color - electric fields just decays according to a power law .",
    "this dependence on the coupling strength is very easy to understand and is in last analysis due to the dependence of the electric conductivity of the plasma on the particle interaction strength @xcite .",
    "in fact at initial times the particles are produced by the schwinger effect with zero longitudinal momentum , then in case the coupling is small they are accelerated by the electric field thus generating an electric current @xmath49 which at first gains energy from the field thus lowering its magnitude ; because of the small coupling particles s momenta is not randomized thus currents are efficiently produced by the field . at some point of time",
    "the field is zero but the current @xmath49 is still nonvanishing and positive hence causing a sign flip of the electric field and a negative acceleration of the charges , resulting eventually in @xmath79 and an increase of the electric field .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , for large values of the coupling the scattering processes among the particles randomize momenta hence causing @xmath80 and the time evolution of the field is a pure decay by the schwinger effect . to consider this point more closely we write down the analytical form of equation  , namely @xmath81\\ ] ] for example in the case one considers only the decay into gluons and assuming for simplicity @xmath82 in eq .",

    "[ fig:3 ] we plot the time evolution of the ratio @xmath7 for the case of the static box , for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "as expected we find that for small values of @xmath0 the system is very efficient in removing the initial anisotropy .",
    "we notice that the initial longitudinal pressure is negative and @xmath87 ; indeed at initial time the system is made of pure color electric field for which @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "on the other hand as soon as particles are produced by the schwinger effect , they give a positive contribution to the longitudinal pressure and the field magnitude decreases , eventually leading to a positive pressure .",
    "moreover because of the strong interactions among the particles produced , @xmath8 and @xmath9 tend to the same value within a very short time range , @xmath92 fm / c .",
    "we notice that regardless of the value of @xmath0 the system tends to remove the initial pressure anisotropy , which is quite natural in the case of the static box since collisions always lead to the equilibrium state .",
    "however isotropization times are different and indeed in the case of a weakly coupled system , see for example the case @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the equilibrium state is reached in a much larger time than in the case of @xmath94 .",
    "moreover the oscillations of the electric field strength in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] lead to many oscillations of @xmath7 in the case @xmath93 , such oscilations being damped effectively within the first fm / c in the case @xmath94 .",
    "in this section we study the effect of a boost invariant longitudinal expansion on pair production from the decay of a chromoelectric flux tube .",
    "we assume the expansion takes place along the direction of the electric field ; moreover the dynamics is invariant for boosts along the longitudinal direction . for this case we will discuss more results because it is closer to the description of the central rapidity region in the early stages of a relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "once again we closely follow the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "we remind very quickly the relevant equations in this case .",
    "the evolution equations for the color electric field are given by the pair of maxwell equations @xmath95 where both current and charge densities are computed in the laboratory frame .",
    "assuming boost invariance along the longitudinal direction implies that @xmath96 depends only on proper time @xmath97 .",
    "we can combine the two eqs .   to form a boost invariant equation , namely @xmath98 which can be rewritten as @xmath99 where the right hand side corresponds to the ( minus ) electric current computed in the reference frame where the time is the proper time , namely the local rest frame of the fluid .",
    "equation   is in agreement with the boost invariant form of maxwell equation used in @xcite , see also @xcite .    to solve eq .",
    "we adopt a finite difference scheme and prepare a box with a square cross section in the transverse direction , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and with cells in space - time rapidity , fixing the range of @xmath11 in which we distribute the produced particles by @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "this implementation corresponds to have a box with a longitudinal expansion since from the well known equations of relativistic kinematics one gets @xmath104 which , for @xmath105 sufficiently large , corresponds to a wall moving at ultrarelativistic speed along the longitudinal direction .",
    "we therefore distribute the pairs created by the decay of the flux tube with uniform probability in each of the cells in @xmath106 .    to take into account the longitudinal expansion eq",
    ".   has to be modifed as @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the momentum rapidity ; @xmath109 depends only on transverse momentum and it is not affected formally by the expanding geometry ; moreover we have introduced the two boost - invariant variables @xmath110 and @xmath111 affects the longitudinal momentum distribution by forcing the condition @xmath112 for the produced pairs , with @xmath23 ; such a condition is equivalent to assume that momentum rapidity of the produced pair is equal to space - time rapidity .",

    "we remind that in our calculation the debye mass is used as an infrared regulator of the differential cross section , and as a parameter which controls the anisotropy of the cross section : for very large values of @xmath59 the differential cross section is isotropic , while for small values of @xmath59 we get a forward peaked cross section .",
    "we find that lowering @xmath59 for a given value of @xmath0 the plasma oscillations tend to be damped .",
    "this can be understood because according to  @xcite lowering @xmath59 while keeping fixed @xmath0 amounts to increase isotropization of the distribution function ; as a consequence the conductive currents , which would sustain plasma oscillations in the late times evolution of the plasma , are damped .",

    "in this article we have reported about our results on the simulations of the schwinger effect for color electric flux tubes , focusing on thermalization and isotropization of the fluid produced by the decay of the electric field in the tube .",
    "these simulations are important in the context of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions , where flux tubes of strong color fields are expected to be produced in the early stage . according to the general understanding of high energy collision processes , this work is relevant both for heavy ion collisions , where a large number of tubes is expected , and for proton - nucleus and proton - proton collisions .",
    "we have studied both the cases of flux tube decay in a static box and in a box with a longitudinal expansion .",
    "the flux tube decay is described by the schwinger effect ; the dynamical evolution of the field is assumed to be abelian",
    "so it satisfies maxwell equations , and the dynamics of the fluid produced by the decay is studied by the relativistic transport theory coupled to the maxwell equations .",
    "we have formulated transport theory in terms of a fixed value of @xmath0 rather than scattering amplitude ; in this way we are able to describe the evolution of the fluid in terms of macroscopic quantities ( @xmath0 ) rather than insisting on a set of specific microscopic processes .",
    "the approach developed here , based on a stochastic solution of the relativistic boltzman equation , has in perspective the advantage to be easily extended to @xmath6d realistic simulations , allowing to study the possible impact of the early dynamics on observables like radial and elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "our study well matches @xcite where the same problem has been studied .",
    "the main difference between the present study and @xcite is that in the latter the relaxation time approximation is used to simplify the collision integral in the boltzmann equation , while in our study we do not use such an approximation hence solving the relativistic kinetic equation with the full collision integral .",
    "we have considered the case of a system with boost invariant longitudinal expansion , which is relevant for the case of simulation of early stages in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have studied many aspects characterizing time evolution of the flux tube . in particular",
    "we have computed decay time of the color electric field , which we find to be a small fraction of fm / c ; for large values of @xmath0 we have found plasma oscillations develop within @xmath2 fm / c and persist for several fm / c in agreement with @xcite ; on the other hand for @xmath151 plasma oscillations are very mild or even absent .",
    "we have also computed the time evolution of the longitudinal to the transverse pressure ratio @xmath7 . given the particular initial field configuration and the absence of particle quanta at @xmath152 we have @xmath134 at initial time",
    "; however longitudinal pressure becomes positive in @xmath153 fm / c because particles are produced by the schwinger mechanism , giving a positive contribution to the pressure .",
    "for @xmath151 we have found isotropization times @xmath154 0.8 fm / c ; for larger values of @xmath0 plasma oscillations cause the system to be less isotropic .",
    "our results imply that for a fluid with @xmath155 isotropization time is less than @xmath2 fm / c .",
    "this would justify the use of viscous hydrodynamics with initial times @xmath156 fm / c for @xmath157 .",
    "it remains to be understood if the oscillations of @xmath7 for @xmath158 fm / c affect some observable in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "our approach based on the stochastic solution of the boltzmann equation is already set up to perform simulations starting from more realistic initial conditions and evolutions in 3 + 1 dimensions , which will be useful to understand quantitatively the effect of such early times behaviour of physical quantities on observables .",
    "we have also studied proper energy density and temperature evolution as well as particle spectra in the transverse plane for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that in case of small @xmath0 the dynamics is very efficient in both removing the initial anisotropy and in getting a quick thermalization ; in fact for @xmath94 we find thermalization time @xmath159 fm / c by comparing the particle spectrum at @xmath129 fm / c with the thermal spectrum eq .",
    "where we put the temperature equal to the one we obtain in the simulation , see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2anew ] . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing @xmath0 results in a mismatch between the thermal and the actual spectra at @xmath129 fm / c , meaning thermalization time is larger in these cases .    to check the effect of microscopic details on the quantities we have computed ,",
    "we have turned the microscopic cross section from isotropic to anisotropic by changing the value of the debye screening mass in the two body cross section while keeping @xmath0 fixed .",
    "we have found that changing @xmath59 does not lead to significant changes in the evolution of physical quantities , besides small deviations in the early times evolution and some mild damping of field oscillations in the case of the largest @xmath0 .",
    "we have also considered the effect of turning from the ce to relaxation time approximation ( rta ) formula connecting the shear viscosity to the total cross section , still keeping the full collision integral in the boltzmann equation .",
    "this is not exactly what has been done in @xcite where rta is used as an ansatz for the collision integral .",
    "we have found that in the case of a forward peaked cross section changing from ce to rta affects the behaviour of @xmath7 , increasing oscillations at early times .",
    "nevertheless late times dynamics is almost unaffected by this change .",
    "there are several points we have not considered in this study .",
    "we have neglected rapidity fluctuations in the electric field which would break boost invariance . moreover in our description we have not included a longitudinal magnetic field at initial time which might modify sligthly the schwinger amplitude @xcite . both fluctuations in rapidity and the initial chromomagnetic field are quite interesting ingredients to add to the present study and we plan to add them in future works .",
    "moreover it would be of a certain interest to consider geometries with several flux tubes pinned on the transverse plane , hence pushing our calculations towards more realistic initial state conditions for heavy ion collisions as well as quantitative predictions of observables of phenomenological interest like multiplicities , particle spectra and collective flows .",
    "we will consider these developments in forthcoming publications .",
