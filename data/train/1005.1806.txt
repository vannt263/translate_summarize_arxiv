    "proton - proton collisions at @xmath1 = 900 gev have already appeared at the lhc and the results will be compared with s@xmath0s data on proton - antiproton collisions at the same center of mass energy measured by ua5 collaboration . in this paper",
    "we point out some nuances concerning ua5 measurements and results and show that the uncertainties of measurements are underestimated by ua5 .",
    "this can lead to discrepancies between @xmath2 and @xmath0 at @xmath1 = 900 gev and be wrongly interpreted in future theoretical analyses .",
    "first we investigate the result of measurements of cross - sections and then the result of measurements of charged particles pseudorapidity distribution .",
    "in this section we investigate the results of ua5 measuremnt on cross - sections of single - diffractive , non - single diffractive and inelastic @xmath0 interactions . + * the measurement of @xmath3 ratio at @xmath4 200 and 900 gev*. + the ua5 detector and event analysis procedures are described in @xcite .",
    "two large streamer chambers were placed above and below the s@xmath0s beam pipe .",
    "the chambers were triggered by requiring one or more hits in scintillation counter hodoscopes at each end of the chambers covering @xmath5 .",
    "two triggers were taken in parallel : a `` 2-arm '' trigger requiring hits at both ends to select mainly non single - diffractive events , and a `` 1-arm '' trigger demanding a hit in only one arm to select highly asymmetric events such as single diffractive events . + in case of single - diffraction dissociation ua5 triggered particles produced from anti - proton dissociation and the measured 1-arm triggering cross - section multiplied by factor 2 in order to correct for proton dissociation ( assuming proton and anti - proton dissociations to be the same ) .",
    "+ the triggering cross sections @xmath6 and @xmath7 for 1-arm and 2-arm triggers are related to the single - diffractive and non - single diffractive cross - sections by the trigger efficiencies @xmath8 as follows : @xmath9    solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : trxs ] ) for @xmath3 one finds : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and the result of the measurement is @xcite : @xmath12 determining 1-arm and 2-arm triggering efficiencies for single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events based on mc simulations , ua5 reported the following value for @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 the first error is statistical and the second systematic . + * the evaluation of triggering efficiencies . * + the triggering efficiencies @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trxs ] ) were estimated by ua5 based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "ua5 detector did not have magnet and was not able to measure the transverse momentum of particles .",
    "the mc generator used for simulations was tuned to reproduce multiplicity and pseudo - rapidity distribution of particles , but simulations were done for different values of mean transverse momentum of particles in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties of measurements @xcite .",
    "+ in ua5 mc generator @xcite the cross - section of single - diffraction dissociation as a function of diffracted system mass was parametrized as follows : @xmath15 and masses were generated in the interval from 1.08 gev ( = @xmath16 ) to @xmath17 ( see @xcite and @xcite for more detailes ) .",
    "+ at fragmentation of a diffracted system in single - diffractive interaction the distribution of particles is centered around @xmath18 and covers the rapidity region from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "when the mass of the diffracted system is small then the particles are mainly concentrated at the forward region .",
    "increasing the mass of the diffracted system the distribution over ( pseudo)rapidities moves to mid - rapidities and the spread of the distribution becomes wider .",
    "thus acceptances of different triggers are sensitive to different mass regions of diffracted system ( at given center of mass energy ) .",
    "in particular , if the triggers are not placed in very forward region then the particles produced from low - mass diffracted system will not hit the triggers .",
    "@xcite ua5 claims that masses below 2.5 gev/@xmath21 were almost never seen by the detector . for this purpose",
    "they investigated trigger efficiencies enhancing this low - mass region by 50@xmath22 and studying the consequences of this change in their results .",
    "+ in table [ tb : triggeff ] we present trigger efficiencies for single - diffractive events as reported by ua5 in ref @xcite .    .",
    "1-arm and 2-arm trigger efficiencies for single - diffractive events estimated by ua5 in ref @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     one can see the predictions of both theoretical models are in good agreement with the ua5 data which are `` really '' measured and deviations appear from the extrapolation of single - diffraction cross - section to low - mass region .",
    "+ in regge theory ( see @xcite for details ) the @xmath23 dependence can be obtained assuming the intercept of the pomeron to be unity in the cross - section corresponding to the triple - pomeron diagram . nevertheless , it is a known fact ( and it was known at the times of ua5 ) that the intercept of the pomeron is bigger than one and the cross - section falls steeper ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "in addition to this , at low - mass single - diffraction the contribution of @xmath26 vertex is essential ( @xmath27 ) which falls much steeper than the former one .",
    "thus the low - mass single - diffraction cross - section is bigger than the one expected from @xmath28 dependence if one fixes the spectra at high - masses .",
    "this is the reason of discrepancy between the results of extrapolation of both theoretical models and ua5 .",
    "+ it must be stressed that the low - mass single - diffraction is experimentally studied in details up to at isr energies ( a theoretical analysis of these data can be found in @xcite ) . from s@xmath0s and",
    "tevaton experiments we do not know much about it .",
    "nevertheless , ua4 @xcite from s@xmath0s reported that at @xmath1 = 546 gev the measured cross - section of single - diffraction in the region of masses @xmath29 gev/@xmath21 is higher by about a factor two than the one expected from the extrapolation with @xmath28 dependence from high - masses to low - masses .",
    "this experimental fact argues in favor of both theoretical models used in this analysis .",
    "+ so , the value or the systematic error ( of amount 1 mb , which should include the uncertainty of extrapolation to the single - diffraction dissociation cross - section to the low - mass region ) assigned by ua5 to the inelastic and single - diffractive cross - sections at 900 gev in ( [ eq : inelxs900 ] ) and ( [ eq : sdxs ] ) is underestimated by at least @xmath30 mb .",
    "in this section we consider the results of ua5 measuremnt on charged particles pseudorapidity distribution in single - diffractive , non - single diffractive and inelastic @xmath0 interactions and discuss their consistency / inconsistency .",
    "+ although the ua5 collaboration in @xcite studied only diffraction dissociation of proton , the final results for inelastic events are expected to be corrected also for anti - proton dissociation .",
    "we compare the predictions of quark - gluon string model ( qgsm , see @xcite ) for single and non - single diffractive events with the data and later for inelastic ones . in order to calculate the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles for inelastic events we mixed single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events with the weights predicted by the theoretical model as well as with the weights deduced from experimental data .",
    "+ * charged particles density @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 in single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events * + qgsm predictions on charged particles pseudorapidity in single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events are in reasonable agreement with ua5 data ( see figs [ fig : dndetasd ] and [ fig : dndetansd ] ) .",
    "ua5 data are taken from @xcite and the details of theoretical calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we stress that the description of these data is achieved in a parameter - free way .",
    "+ by definition , in inelastic collisions of two hadrons the diffractive dissociations of each of the incoming hadrons may take place separately ( single - diffractive dissociation ) , and in addition the non - single diffractive interactions may also take place .",
    "this is illustrated by ( [ eq : inel ] ) for proton - antiproton collision .",
    "@xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndetainel ] we compare the predictions of qgsm with the experimental data from ua5 ( @xcite ) for pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles in inelastic events . in order to calculate the @xmath31 for inelastic events we summed charged particles pseudorapidity distributions of single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events with the default theoretically calculated weights ( solid lines ) @xcite as well as with the weights deduced from the experimental data ( dotted lines ) @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath34 using the following expression : @xmath35 as we see , the predictions of qgsm for inelastic evens are significantly different from experimental data in @xmath32 region from 1 to 3 , whereas the predictions for single - diffractive and non - single diffractive events are described well enough . +",
    "at @xmath1 = 900 gev @xmath0 single - diffractive interactions ua5 triggers were not able to register particles produced from diffracted systems with masses below 2.5 gev/@xmath21 . for correcting inelastic and single - diffractive cross - sections for this low - mass diffraction region ua5 used @xmath36 simple parameterization which resulted to underestimation of inelastic and single - diffraction dissociation cross - sections by @xmath30 mb .",
    "+ from an analysis of ua5 data for charged particles pseudorapidity distributions in single - diffractive , non - single diffractive and inelastic events we conclude that ua5 data are not self - consistent .",
    "+ these factes must be taken into account during the tuning of theoretical models ( and mc generators ) and at further comparison of lhc @xmath2 data with ua5 @xmath0 data .",
