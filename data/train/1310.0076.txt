    "the miniboone experiment has , for the last 10 years , searched for @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the booster neutrino beamline at fermilab .",
    "the beam was shut down in april 2012 to enable the fermilab accelerator complex to be upgraded in preparation for delivering higher beam power to the nova experiment . before the shutdown",
    ", miniboone completed an antineutrino phase of running which brought the total amount of beam delivered to the experiment to @xmath8 protons on target ( pot ) in antineutrino mode and @xmath9  pot in neutrino mode .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 oscillation analyses have been conducted with this data individually  @xcite-@xcite and recently as a combined data set with the latest updates to the antineutrino data  @xcite .",
    "there is an excess of events over the calculated background in both modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_nubar_stack ] ) examined individually as well as for the combined data set which contains a total excess of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) events .",
    "a two - neutrino fit to the combined data set yields allowed parameter regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mb_nu_nubar_combined_fit ] ) which are consistent with oscillations in the 0.01 to 1 ev@xmath12 @xmath13 range and are consistent with the regions reported by the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "the excess occurs in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 samples at low energy , and so it is natural to consider more carefully the largest backgrounds in that energy region .",
    "they are dominated by neutral - current ( nc ) @xmath16 and nc @xmath17 radiative decays ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "both of these nc processes are constrained by measurements within miniboone , but an anomalous process such as nc @xmath0 production , not sufficiently accounted for in the miniboone analysis , could lessen the significance of the oscillation excess .",
    "we are proposing to measure these backgrounds with a new technique combined with additional running of miniboone .",
    "the miniboone detector uses 800 tons of mineral oil ( ch@xmath19 ) as a target medium for inducing cc and nc neutrino interactions .",
    "the mineral oil also serves as the detector medium for observing the final state particles resulting from the interactions .",
    "this is achieved via detection of the cerenkov light from charged particles in the 1280 8  photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) that line the inside of the spherical detector tank .",
    "in addition to the cerenkov light produced in a cone around the trajectory of charged particles , some isotropic scintillation light is produced due to the presence of aromatic impurities in the mineral oil .",
    "we propose adding approximately 300  kg of ppo scintillator to the 800 tons of miniboone mineral oil to increase the amount of scintillation light produced by 2.2  mev @xmath0 that result from delayed ( @xmath20s ) neutron capture on protons within the mineral oil .",
    "this will allow an important test of the oscillation signal by checking that the excess is indeed due to cc interactions of low - energy neutrinos and not an incorrectly calculated nc background .",
    "this can be done by counting @xmath21-capture events that follow oscillation candidate events .",
    "if the excess is indeed due to cc interactions of low energy @xmath22 , only approximately @xmath23 of the excess will have associated @xmath21-capture events .",
    "if , instead , the excess is due to a nc process , one would expect many more neutrons produced since the interactions are caused from higher energy neutrinos .",
    "one expects approximately 50% of nc background events to have an associated neutron .",
    "an attractive feature of this method is that the neutron fraction for cc and nc processes may be measured with miniboone via similar channels , thereby eliminating that systematic uncertainty",
    ".    the increased level of scintillation will enable several other important measurements .",
    "the detection of @xmath21-capture enables a measurement of the neutron to proton ratio in nc elastic scattering which is sensitive to the strange - quark spin of the nucleon ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 decay from the @xmath25 in the @xmath5 process will be better reconstructed which will allow a measurement of this process and a check of the low - energy neutrino flux .",
    "low - energy recoil nucleons will be more visible within neutrino events allowing a test of the quasielastic assumption in neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "a main motivation for adding scintillator to miniboone is to provide a test of the nature of the low - energy excess of events observed in both the @xmath22 and @xmath26 appearance searches conducted by miniboone .",
    "the addition of scintillator will also enable an investigation of the strange - quark contribution to the nucleon spin ( @xmath4 ) , a measurement of the @xmath27 reaction , and a test of the quasielastic assumption in neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "miniboone has measured a @xmath11 excess of oscillation candidate events in the combined @xmath28 and @xmath29 data sets collected to date at fermilab  @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_nubar_stack ] , the predicted backgrounds in the low energy regions , where the excess is most substantial , are dominated by neutral current backgrounds .",
    "these nc backgrounds are from two major sources : misidentification of the @xmath16 ( `` @xmath16 misid '' ) and the production of @xmath17 baryons which then radiatively decay ( `` @xmath30 '' )",
    ". a test of these nc backgrounds in a measurement with different systematic errors would be quite valuable to firmly establish the oscillation excess .",
    "miniboone can perform this test by detecting neutrons associated with oscillation candidate events . in brief , at low @xmath31 , true cc oscillation events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fd_ccnc_set : a ] ) should contain final - state neutrons in less than 10% of the events while the nc backgrounds ( figs .  [ fig : fd_ccnc_set : b],[fig : fd_ccnc_set : c ] ) should contain neutrons in @xmath32 of the events .",
    "note that @xmath31 is the reconstructed neutrino energy using the assumption of neutrino quasielastic scattering from a neutron .",
    "this quantity should be a good estimate for the true neutrino energy in true cc oscillation events ( excepting possible nuclear effects , sec .",
    "[ sec : enuqetest ] ) .",
    "however , because of the large missing energy in nc events , the true neutrino energy is , on average , much higher than @xmath31 for nc backgrounds events .",
    "so , in a first approximation , the nc backgrounds will contain more final state neutrons because the events are from higher true neutrino energy .",
    "more energy is transferred to the nucleus which causes more neutron production as compared to the cc signal in which the true neutrino energy is lower and ( neglecting final state interactions ) produces a single proton .    in practice",
    ", we would rerun the miniboone oscillation search in neutrino mode after the addition of scintillator in order to enable neutron detection .",
    "oscillation candidates would be selected with the same strategy as the original search . from this sample ,",
    "we would search for neutron capture events and measure the neutron fraction which would test the nc background estimates .",
    "an important feature of this measurement is that the neutron fraction may be `` calibrated '' for the oscillation search via separate miniboone @xmath28 ccqe and @xmath28 nc@xmath16 measurements which greatly reduces errors from any nuclear model uncertainties .",
    "the nc neutrino - nucleon elastic scattering ( nc elastic ) interaction , @xmath33 , is sensitive to the isoscalar - axial structure of the nucleon  @xcite , so will be sensitive to the effects of strange - quark contributions to the nucleon spin ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , the right type of measurement of nc elastic scattering would contribute substantially to the nucleon spin puzzle , an area of continued interest and effort ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this measurement of nc elastic scattering has not yet been realized .",
    "miniboone has made the most accurate measurement to date of the differential cross section for @xmath33  @xcite and the analysis for the @xmath34 process is almost complete  @xcite . while these are valuable measurements to help with understanding of neutrino - nucleon scattering , they are not sensitive to @xmath4 because miniboone is not able currently to distinguish between neutrons and protons .",
    "the @xmath35 process is sensitive to @xmath4 with the opposite sign as @xmath36 and any strange quark effects cancel in the existing miniboone measurement .",
    "this situation changes abruptly with the addition of neutron - capture tagging . in that case , the neutrons and protons can be separately identified and the neutron / proton ratio , @xmath37 is quite sensitive to @xmath4  @xcite . based on previous studies  @xcite , a rough estimate is that a 10% measurement of @xmath38 should result in an error of @xmath39 uncertainty on @xmath4 .",
    "it should be realized that the recent results from miniboone on the unexpectedly large ccqe cross section  @xcite may call into question the theoretical uncertainty involved in extracting @xmath4 from @xmath38 .",
    "if there are multinucleon correlations contributing substantially to nc elastic scattering , it may not be clear how that affects the extraction of @xmath4 .",
    "regardless , a 10% measurement of @xmath38 will be a valuable constraint and will further more theoretical investigation .",
    "the reaction @xmath5 is an interesting reaction to study with a scintillator - enhanced miniboone for several reasons .",
    "it comes with a distinctive tag from the @xmath24-decay of the @xmath25 with endpoint energy of 16.3  mev and lifetime of 15.9  ms .",
    "this addition of scintillator to miniboone will allow for high efficiency and better reconstruction of the @xmath24-decay .",
    "since it is an exclusive reaction , the theoretical cross section can be calculated to @xmath40 very near threshold  @xcite .",
    "it was measured by lsnd for both @xmath28 and @xmath22  @xcite and by karmen for @xmath22  @xcite to agree with theory to within experimental errors .",
    "a measurement by miniboone of this theoretically well - known reaction would enable a test of the low - energy neutrino flux which could better constrain the low - energy oscillation excess .",
    "the event signature is quite distinct .",
    "the low - energy prompt @xmath41 and subsequent decay @xmath42 would be detected with the usual techniques employed for @xmath28 ccqe events combined with a requirement for a detected @xmath24-decay candidate . with the addition of scintillator to make 2.2  mev @xmath0 visible , the efficiency for detecting the 16.3  mev - endpoint @xmath24 will be quite high .",
    "the challenge is that the fraction of the total @xmath28 scattering events that interact via @xmath5 is small . in the lowest energy bin at @xmath43  mev ,",
    "the cross section is about 4% of the @xmath28 ccqe cross section , falling to about 0.5% by @xmath44  mev  @xcite .",
    "however , with the data sample proposed here the total @xmath28 event sample will be large , the @xmath25 signature quite distinct , and an analysis will be worth the effort .",
    "miniboone has reported absolutely normalized cross sections for various @xmath28-carbon processes including @xmath28 ccqe  @xcite , cc@xmath45  @xcite , cc@xmath16  @xcite , nc elastic  @xcite , and nc@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "they all show a 30 - 40% larger cross section than predicted in previously existing models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one emerging idea is that two - nucleon correlations in carbon are contributing significantly to the interaction cross section  @xcite .",
    "if this is the correct explanation for the extra strength in these neutrino interactions , then it could also have a significant effect on the reconstructed neutrino energy in oscillation events , @xmath31 , which assumes quasielastic scattering from single nucleons within carbon  @xcite .",
    "in short , the reconstructed neutrino energy may be incorrect in a large fraction of the oscillation events leading to incorrect conclusions about the resulting fits to oscillation models .",
    "the addition of scintillator will allow this idea to be experimentally tested . with the scintillator addition proposed here",
    ", the detector response to final state nucleons in a typical ccqe event will be increased by about a factor of five .",
    "this scintillation light is a measure of the total energy in the event ( @xmath46 ) as opposed to that reconstructed from the just the lepton track , @xmath31 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath31 with @xmath46 will allow further insight into the two - nucleon correlation issue in general and , specifically , into its relevance to the low - energy oscillation excess .",
    "in this section , we explore some details of how to prepare and run miniboone with the addition of scintillator .      as of this writing , we plan to add 300  kg of ppo to the @xmath47  liters of miniboone mineral oil ( 300  mg",
    "/ l ) . a preliminary price quote for ppo from the supplier to nova is $ 250/kg or $ 75k for scintillator .",
    "the solubility of ppo will allow us to add the entire 300  kg to the miniboone 10  kl overflow and then introduce that into the main volume by recirculation .",
    "however , it would be prudent to do this addition in at least two steps by taking the concentration to about 50% of the desired amount and monitoring detector response with cosmic muons and muon - decay electrons .",
    "we may do recirculation without the addition of scintillator as a first step , as the miniboone oil has not been recirculated since commissioning in 2002 .",
    "our base plan for running with scintillator is only to add scintillator with no other changes .",
    "new readout electronics could be considered , but are not required for the physics goals set here .",
    "the current rate of pmt and failures extrapolated for a 3-year run is not a problem .",
    "we estimate that the rate of electronics failures over that time period will be covered with our current supply of spares .",
    "there will likely be some changes to the computing infrastructure to keep up with hardware failures and security concerns , but an `` as - needed '' approach is our current plan .",
    "the neutron fraction measurement for oscillation candidates is statistics limited and @xmath2 pot is required for our current desired accuracy .",
    "when the microboone experiment is running , our assumption is that @xmath48  pot / year will be delivered to the booster neutrino beamline ( bnb ) .",
    "this sets a 3-year duration for the proposed scintillator phase of miniboone .",
    "preparation for running only requires the addition of scintillator ( along with modest detector maintenance ) , which we estimate will require about 3 months with no beam requirement .",
    "the addition of @xmath49  mg / l of scintillator to the existing miniboone mineral oil will allow for the detection and reconstruction of 2.2  mev @xmath0 from neutron - capture .",
    "cc oscillation signal events should have an associated neutron in less than 10% of events in contrast to nc background events in which @xmath32 have neutrons .",
    "the neutron - capture rate for both of these event types can be separately measured in miniboone , thus eliminating dependence on neutron production model calculations .",
    "therefore , a measurement of neutron - capture in oscillation events measures the nc backgrounds .",
    "a measurement of the neutron - fraction in a new appearance oscillation search with miniboone will increase the significance of the oscillation excess , if it maintains in the new data set , to @xmath50 . in practice",
    ", the original oscillation search will be conducted again after the introduction of scintillator . with @xmath2 pot",
    ", the results of this search ( before neutron capture cuts ) should have similar sensitivity as existing search but with different systematic errors .",
    "combining this with the neutron capture analysis will raise the sensitivity to the @xmath3 level , perhaps better , depending on final systematics .",
    "this new phase of miniboone would enable additional important studies such as the spin structure of nucleon ( @xmath4 ) via nc elastic scattering , a low - energy measurement of the neutrino flux via the @xmath5 reaction , and a test of the quasielastic assumption in neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "this effort will provide traning for ph.d .",
    "students and postdocs and will yield important , highly - cited results over the next 5 years for a modest cost .",
