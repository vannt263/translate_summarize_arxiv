    "the orbital period @xmath2 is the one parameter of a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) which observers can usually measure with confidence .",
    "roche geometry implies a close relation @xmath3 between this period and the mass and radius @xmath4 of the mass  losing star .",
    "the accretion luminosity of cvs suggests that the mass transfer timescale @xmath5 is considerably shorter than the age of the galaxy , so that @xmath6 change on this timescale .",
    "hence the observed distribution of cv periods is by far the most significant indicator of cv evolution .",
    "as is well known , it is consistent with the idea that the evolution is driven by angular momentum losses from the binary orbit ( see e.g. king , 1988 for a review ) .",
    "the observed cv histogram ( fig .",
    "1 ) cuts off sharply at an orbital period of @xmath7  min .",
    "there are respectively 0 and 12 systems in the period ranges @xmath8  min .",
    "the idea that @xmath9 represents a global period minimum ( @xmath10 for @xmath9 ) for cvs has been widely accepted for the last two decades .",
    "it is clear that such a global minimum can exist ( paczyski , 1981 ; paczyski & sienkiewicz , 1981 ; rappaport , joss & webbink , 1982 ) . as the mass @xmath11 of an unevolved secondary star in a cv",
    "is reduced by mass transfer , the binary period @xmath2 usually decreases also , with @xmath12 .",
    "however for very small @xmath13 , the secondary s kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time @xmath14 exceeds the timescale @xmath5 for mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation . instead of shrinking smoothly to the main  sequence radius appropriate to",
    "its reduced mass , the star can not now reduce its entropy quickly enough and contracts more slowly . from ( [ porb ] )",
    "we see that once @xmath15 decreases more slowly than @xmath16 the orbital period @xmath2 must begin to increase , defining a minimum ( ` bounce ' ) period @xmath1 for the system .",
    "it is important to realize that there is nothing extreme about conditions in the binary at this point ; in particular the mass transfer rate remains almost precisely the same ( @xmath17 ) as when the system was well above the period minimum , cf kolb ( 2002 ) , fig .",
    "3 . nor do conditions change drastically thereafter : since @xmath18 at @xmath9 we have @xmath19  gyr .",
    "hence most cvs do not have time to evolve to significantly longer periods or lower mass transfer rates after reaching @xmath20 : clearly to evolve to @xmath21 would require of order the age of the galaxy .",
    "cvs reaching @xmath9 thus remain clustered there with mass transfer rates similar to those of systems at longer periods .",
    "detailed calculations always predict a value @xmath1 very close to , if slightly shorter than , the observed @xmath9 .",
    "the discrepancy @xmath22 is persistent , but may reflect uncertain or over  simple input physics ( cf kolb & baraffe , 1999 ) .",
    "in particular the difference between the true and spherically approximated radii may account for most of the disagreement .",
    "however there is a much more serious problem with this interpretation of the observed cutoff at @xmath9 .",
    "this concerns the discovery probability @xmath23 here @xmath24 is some ( presumably positive ) power describing observational selection effects . for example @xmath25 for a bolometric flux ",
    "limited sample , while @xmath26 is often assumed for systems detected via optical outbursts . since @xmath10 at @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 must clearly have a significant maximum there unless @xmath29 declines very sharply near this period .",
    "in other words , the observed cv period histogram should show a sharp rise near a global minimum @xmath1 unless the mass transfer rate drops there .",
    "however , as mentioned above , all evolutionary calculations show that @xmath29 changes very little as @xmath1 is approached .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath9 is a global minimum there should be a large ` spike ' in the cv period histogram there ( cf kolb & baraffe , 1999 ) . instead , the observed period histogram ( fig .",
    "1 ) has a ` corner ' at @xmath9 , i.e. a sharp cutoff of a fairly flat distribution , but no spike .    ) . ]",
    "the lack of a spike in the observed distribution has prompted numerous theoretical investigations ( see kolb , 2002 for a review , and barker & kolb 2002 ) .",
    "most of these propose ways in which cvs might become difficult to discover near @xmath9 .",
    "a basic problem for this type of argument is that , as we have seen , there is nothing at all unusual about the system parameters ( mass transfer rate , separation etc ) at this period .",
    "further , attempts to use accretion disc properties as a way of making systems hard to discover founder on the fact that the am  herculis systems , which have no accretion discs , have precisely the same observed short ",
    "period cutoff @xmath30  min , and no spike either .",
    "king & schenker ( 2002 ) suggested that cv formation may take roughly the age of the galaxy , so that the oldest systems have not yet quite reached the minimum period . the fine  tuning here is perhaps worrying , although not easily disproved . in this paper",
    "we suggest a solution to the spike problem invoking a a different new ingredient in the standard picture of cv evolution .",
    "]    the new element we introduce into the standard picture is the idea of a _ distribution _ of minimum periods @xmath20 . at first sight",
    "this may not seem a particularly radical step",
    ". however it amounts to allowing the intervention of a second controlling parameter .",
    "second , note that the difficult part here is not smearing out the spike , but _ simultaneously retaining the sharp cutoff at @xmath9 . _    to fix ideas we first formulate a simplified version of the spike problem which has the virtue of being exactly soluble , and then proceed to a more realistic approach . in the simplified problem we make the following approximations :    \\1 .",
    "we assume that the relative discovery probability for any individual cv depends only on @xmath31 , and can be represented as @xmath32 here the @xmath33 s are heaviside functions , @xmath20 is the bounce period for the individual cv , and @xmath34 are constants . as can be seen by comparison with the lowest panel of figure 3 of kolb ( 2002 ) this is a fair representation if we take @xmath35  min , with @xmath36  min in the case shown there .    \\2 .",
    "the observed cv histogram is taken as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization .",
    "this is a relatively crude representation of the observed histogram ( fig .",
    "1 ) , but does capture in essence its only significant feature , the ` corner ' at @xmath9 .",
    "armed with these assumptions , we determine the relative distribution @xmath39 of cvs with minimum period at a given @xmath20 . clearly the observed histogram @xmath40 is the convolution of @xmath39 with @xmath41 , so using ( [ pp ] , [ hist ] ) we have @xmath42 taking laplace transforms , the convolution theorem gives @xmath43 now since @xmath44{\\rm d}x } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   = \\frac{1}{s } - \\frac{a}{s}e^{-\\delta p s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get @xmath45 hence transforming back we have @xmath46 this result gives a decomposition of the assumed histogram which is completely obvious when plotted ( fig .",
    "however it does illustrate the main point : one can create a rather flat but cut  off distribution ( cf [ hist ] ) from the very spiky individual probabilities ( [ pp ] ) by taking a distribution of bounce periods @xmath47 falling off with @xmath20 ( here as @xmath48 ) for @xmath49 . dropping the higher  order terms @xmath50 produces a downward step at @xmath51 in an otherwise uniform distribution , the discontinuity having size @xmath52 .",
    "if a 15% downwards glitch is regarded at the limit of acceptability when compared with observation , we can estimate the spread in @xmath20 required to wash out the spike as @xmath53  min = 15  min . similarly if we define @xmath54 by @xmath55 then more than 50% of cvs in the period range @xmath56 are close to their local minima @xmath20 ( i.e. are in their local ` spikes ' ) .",
    "we find @xmath57 , so we expect half of the cvs in a 5.6  min range above @xmath9 to be near their local @xmath20 values .",
    "it is now easy to guess a continuous form of @xmath39 which gives a reasonable representation of the corner as @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3 , with the fitting extended to a maximum @xmath20 equal to ( a ) @xmath59 , and ( b ) @xmath60 . as can be seen , extending to the longer period produces a much more acceptable representation .",
    "we can thus state our main result : the cv distribution near the short  period cutoff @xmath9 is well reproduced if cvs have a declining distribution of individual minimum periods @xmath20 above the floor value @xmath9 .",
    "in standard cv evolution ( e.g. king , 1988 ) the global properties of a system at any epoch are specified by two parameters , e.g. the initial primary and secondary masses @xmath61 , corresponding to a white dwarf and an unevolved low  mass star respectively .",
    "given these two quantities we can in principle calculate all others such as period , mean mass transfer rate and discovery probability @xmath62 at any subsequent time . in practice evolutions starting from different initial secondary masses @xmath63 converge very rapidly to an effectively common track ( stehle et al .",
    ", 1996 ) , and even the dependence on white dwarf mass is very weak .",
    "thus in this standard picture all global properties of a cv are essentially specified if we know the orbital period @xmath2 .",
    "this extreme simplicity gives the standard picture its predictive power , but also makes it vulnerable to problems such as the missing spike at @xmath9 .",
    "this is clearly predicted if every cv follows the common evolutionary track . to blunt the spike in the manner considered above",
    "requires sensitivity to a further physical parameter .",
    "paczyski & sienkiewicz ( 1983 ) show that this can not be the primary mass or the assumed mean surface opacities ( in any case the latter do not in principle constitute an independent parameter ) .",
    "we therefore turn to the other effect altering @xmath20 considered by paczyski & sienkiewicz ( 1983 ) , namely increasing systemic angular momentum losses @xmath64 by a factor @xmath65 above the gravitational radiation value @xmath66 .",
    "they found a @xmath67  min spread in @xmath20 for a range @xmath68 .",
    "we checked this using the codes of mazzitelli ( 1989 )  as adapted by kolb & ritter ( 1992 )  and hameury ( 1991 ) , and found that the required @xmath69  min spread results for @xmath70 .",
    "note that in fixing this range of @xmath65 we assume that evolution with @xmath71 , i.e. driven purely by gr , does produce the minimum bounce period @xmath72  min , and thus that theoretical efforts in this direction will succeed .",
    "we could instead in principle use a value @xmath73 to bring @xmath20 and @xmath9 into agreement , but this would rob us of the natural explanation for such a global minimum @xmath74 , namely that this is the limit in which all other angular momentum loss mechanisms are small compared with gr .",
    "we have shown that the corner in the cv period distribution is reasonably well reproduced provided that cv evolution has a second controlling parameter spreading the minimum periods of an exponential tail of cvs by @xmath75  min . the most likely candidate for this parameter",
    "is an increase of the orbital angular momentum loss rate above that provided by gravitational radiation by a factor @xmath65 , ranging from 1 to at least 6 . since gravitational radiation",
    "must always be present , the requirement @xmath76 simply implies another angular momentum loss process whose strength ranges from values latexmath:[$",
    "< <    candidate here is varying admixtures of magnetic stellar wind braking . the physical origin of the extra degree of freedom specified by @xmath65 might then simply be the intrinsic strength of the stellar magnetic field in the region of the ism from which the secondary star formed , which may then influence the strength of any dynamo  amplified or generated field .",
    "it is an observed fact that otherwise similar stars can have very different magnetic field strengths , and this presumably applies to the secondary stars of cvs also .",
    "apparently in most cases this field gives only weak magnetic braking @xmath78 , but there is evidently a tail of systems with stronger braking .",
    "this would for example naturally result if the distribution of intrinsic magnetic fields were a gaussian , with the mean sufficiently high to give strong braking above the period gap , but too low for such braking below the gap in all but an exponential tail of cvs .     in the interrupted magnetic braking picture ( rappaport , verbunt & joss , 1983",
    ", spruit & ritter , 1983 ) illustrated schematically for a cv becoming fully convective at @xmath79  hr with magnetic braking rate @xmath80 .",
    "to form the observed period gap between @xmath81 and @xmath82 hours , @xmath83 must drop rapidly from a value of @xmath84 to @xmath85 , and _ stay low _ for a kelvin time .",
    "after this , any amount of magnetic braking may be possible , leading to significantly different bounce periods @xmath20 as given on the righthand axis . ]",
    "this is a satisfying conclusion , as one of the objections to the usual mechanism for forming the cv period gap between 3  2 hours has been that strong magnetic activity is observed in main  sequence stars with masses low enough to be secondaries in cvs below the gap .",
    "the answer to this objection is now that indeed such activity may well occur in systems below the gap , but in most cases the resulting braking is weaker than gr .",
    "however for @xmath86 much of the tail has values of magnetic braking considerably stronger than the extrapolation of the usual magnetic braking laws adopted for cvs above the gap ( verbunt & zwaan , 1981 mestel & spruit , 1987 ) .",
    "evidently these laws do not describe this regime well , in agreement with the idea that the nature of the braking changes character once the secondaries become fully convective ( taam & spruit , 1989 ) .",
    "it is therefore also plausible that intrinsically stronger fields are required below the period gap in order to give significant braking rates , thus accounting for the exponential tail of systems with strong braking as suggested above .",
    "we note that gap formation requires only that magnetic braking @xmath87 should be _ interrupted _ , not _ suppressed _ , at @xmath79  hr ( plausibly where the secondary first becomes fully convective ) .",
    "figure 4 illustrates cases where the braking after the detached phase almost reaches the value before it .",
    "provided magnetic braking does not resume , at something like its former strength , before the oversized secondary has managed to shrink significantly towards its main  sequence radius ( on a timescale @xmath88  yr ) , a gap of the observed properties will result .",
    "if the association with the change to a fully convective structure is maintained , we would thus require that the resulting change in field topology or strength takes at least a time @xmath89 . to achieve the required smearing in @xmath20",
    "the angular momentum losses of a fraction of cvs must change in a way similar to the curve shown in fig .",
    "this discussion suggests that there is no obvious reason for any upper limit on the factor @xmath65 , given only that the distribution of @xmath65 values drops as @xmath65 increases above unity .",
    "systems with large @xmath65 have high mass transfer rates , and bounce at quite long periods .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with observation , provided that only a minority of cvs below the gap have such high values of @xmath90 .",
    "we thus suggest that magnetic braking has the following properties ( cf fig .",
    "4 )    \\(i ) in most cvs above the period gap it drives mass transfer rates @xmath91    \\(ii ) when a cv secondary becomes fully convective , magnetic braking rapidly drops to very low values for at least the thermal timescale of the star    \\(iii ) magnetic braking is present in all cvs below the period gap , and its strength depends on an inherent property of the secondary , possibly the formation magnetic field . in most cases it is weaker than gravitational radiation , but there is an exponential tail of systems with much stronger braking .",
    "these values are much bigger than given by extrapolating the usual magnetic braking laws to short orbital periods , and may thus require the strongest fields .",
