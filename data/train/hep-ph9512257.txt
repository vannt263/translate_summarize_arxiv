    "one of the most outstanding tasks in strong interaction physics is to calculate the spectrum and the wavefunctions of physical hadrons from quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the method of ` discretized light - cone quantization ' ( dlcq ) @xcite has precisely this goal and has three major aspects :     0ex0ex0ex    a rejuvenation of the hamiltonian approach ,    a denumerable hilbert space of plane waves ,    dirac s front form of hamiltonian dynamics .    in the _ front form _ , using dirac s terminology @xcite , one quantizes at equal ` light - cone time ' @xmath1 , as opposed to the _ instant form _ where one quantizes at equal ` usual time ' @xmath2 .",
    "the front form carries many names like for example _ light - cone quantization _",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the approach has some unique features as reviewed in @xcite : the vacuum is simple , or at least simplier than in the instant form , which in turn implies that the groundstate of the free theory is also the groundstate of the interacting theory . the relativistic wavefunctions transform trivially under certain boost operations @xcite .",
    "both are in stark contrast to the conventional instant form .",
    "discretization , that is the use of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions , provides additional length scales as useful _",
    "regularization parameters _ in a formalism like a quantum field theory which otherwise is littered with divergencies _",
    "ab ovo_. in fact discretization ( or working ` on a circle ' ) is more than only a useful tool for calculations , rather it provides a systematic scheme to formulate the theory _ at all_.    over the years , the light - cone community @xcite has made much progress .",
    "calculations have been done @xcite to verify agreement with other methods particularly lattice gauge theory .",
    "we have learned that _",
    "zero modes _ should not be ignored @xcite , since they can be important carriers of quantum structure .",
    "other calculations in 1-space and 1-time dimension like the dimensionally reduced models @xcite have an interest of their own .",
    "we have learned that there are physical and non - physical gauges , even something like a wavefunction of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "renormalization is a difficult problem within a hamiltonian theory and worth the effort of the best @xcite .",
    "what was _ not _ shown thus far , however , is why all that is useful .",
    "particularly one lacks the contact to phenomenology beyond the perturbative regime @xcite .",
    "we believe that one needs more work like @xcite or like @xcite which relate formalism and actual experimental numbers",
    ". it should be possible to combine rigor with simplicity ! the present work will hopefully be a useful contribution to the extent that we shall derive a rather simple , conventional second order differential equation for the wavefunction in configuration space .",
    "amazingly enough , it seems possible to describe quarks in hadrons by a non - relativistic schrdinger equation to account for the correct retardation and still being in the front form of hamiltonian dynamics applied to quantum chromodynamics .    solving this ` retarded schrdinger equation ' , or better a caricature of this equation , by parametric variation",
    ", we end up with the masses of all pseudoscalar and vector mesons . in comparison with the experimental data @xcite ,",
    "they are no worse than conventional phenomenological models @xcite , or predictions from heavy quark symmetry @xcite , or even predictions based on lattice gauge calculations @xcite . in view of the simplicity of the methods applied we regard this as a success of the front - form approach , particularly since we can and will do better in the future @xcite .",
    "in discretized light - cone quantization one addresses oneself to solve an eigenvalue problem @xmath3 the operator @xmath4 is a lorentz - scalar with the dimension of a @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenvalues have the same dimensions .",
    "we therefore set @xmath6 and interprete @xmath7 as the ` mass of the state @xmath8 ' . in dlcq one works in momentum representation , and thus three of the four components of @xmath9 are diagonal , namely the three total ( light - cone ) momentum operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the fourth component , the total ( light - cone ) energy operator @xmath12 is very complicated and off - diagonal .",
    "the four components of energy - momentum @xmath13 mutually commute ; their matrix elements can be found explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath14 where @xmath15 runs over all partons ( particles ) in a fock state ; each parton has a four - momentum denoted by @xmath16 and sits on its mass shell @xmath17 .",
    "based on the boost - properties of light - cone operators @xcite one always can transform to an intrinsic frame , where @xmath18 and thus @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 is diagonal from the outset , the diagonalization of @xmath21 and of @xmath22 amounts to the same problem .",
    "the hilbert space for diagonalizing @xmath21 is spanned by all possible fock states which have fixed and given eigenvalues of @xmath10 and @xmath23 .",
    "they can be arranged into ` sectors ' @xmath24 , corresponding to their parton composition .",
    "we convene to call the sector with one quark and one antiquark as the sector with @xmath25 . the sector with one quark ( @xmath26 ) , one antiquark ( @xmath27 ) , and one gluon ( @xmath28 )",
    "shall be denoted by @xmath29 , and so on .",
    "it is peculiar to dlcq that the number of sectors is limited for any fixed value of @xmath10 , or of the ` harmonic resolution ' @xmath30 @xcite , since the longitudinal momenta @xmath31 are all positive and non - vanishing numbers .",
    "both k and n can thus be arbitrarily large but are strictly finite . the eigenvalue equation , eq.([eq:1 ] ) ,",
    "can thus be written as a matrix equation for a _",
    "finite _ number of block - matrices @xmath32 , _ i.e. _ @xmath33 the projected wavefunctions are denoted by @xmath34 . the probability amplitude for finding only a @xmath35-pair with no gluons , in a pion for example ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath36 , and correspondingly for the higher sectors .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix eq.([eq:3 ] ) has a finite number of sectors , but thus far each sector has an infinite dimension , since the transversal momenta of each parton can take any positive or negative value , including zero .",
    "the number of states is however finite if one admits only those transversal momenta whose absolute values are smaller than a ` cut - off ' .",
    "the regularization of brodsky and lepage , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 does that in a lorentz - invariant way .",
    "the cut - off mass @xmath38 can but need not depend on the sector number . in the @xmath35 sector , we shall use below @xmath39 such that the ` dynamic ' cut - off @xmath40 is a measure for the off - shell momenta .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is then strictly finite : a finite number of sectors , and within each sector a finite number of fock states .",
    "now , any @xmath41 block matrix equation with the hamiltonian @xmath42 can be transformed identically @xcite into a @xmath43 block matrix equation with the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 as a consequence of working with the front form , the light - cone hamiltonian @xcite and therefore also the effective hamiltonian is additive in the ` kinetic energy ' @xmath46 and the ` effective interaction ' @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath48 note that the effective hamiltonian acts only in the sector with @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the @xmath35 sector . the reduction from eq.([eq:4 ] ) to eqs.([eq:5 ] ) or ( [ eq:6 ] ) is straightforward but complicated , involving only well - defined matrix inversions and multiplications @xcite .",
    "a number of points should be emphasized : no unphysical fock - space truncations are needed as they are advocated sometimes as tamm - dancoff truncations @xcite .",
    "no smallness assumptions on the coupling constant is ever to be made .",
    "the algorithm expresses the ` higher fock space projections ' @xmath34 for @xmath49 as a functional of @xmath50 .",
    "finally , one should emphasize that the procedure @xcite is _ only well defined _ if the fock space is denumerable like in dlcq . as a result one ends up essentially with two contributions to the effective interaction , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a more thorough presentation is presently being prepared .",
    "every finite and well - defined hamiltonian matrix has thus a unique and well - defined effective hamiltonian matrix . in the former @xcite and the present work one considers only the effective interaction as displayed on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and disregards ( not neglects ! ) the annihilation term . without further arguing about that we consider the so defined effective interaction as part of our model .",
    "dlcq was particularly useful to convert the matrix equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) to another matrix equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "once this is done , one can leave the _ discretized _",
    "case by going over to the _ continuum limit_. in the continuum limit the matrix equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) is converted into the integral equation @xcite @xmath51 the kernel is written conveniently in terms of the interaction and the fermion currents , @xmath52 the cut - off function @xmath53 should be a remainder , that the domain of integration is limited according to eq.([eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the four - momentum transfer @xmath54 is defined as the average of the quark and the antiquark , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 finally , @xmath56 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "for qed it takes the value @xmath57 with @xmath58 . for qcd with 3 colors",
    "it takes the value @xmath59 . in either case",
    ", it depends on the momentum transfer due to the renormalization group .",
    "the kernel of eq.([eq:9 ] ) looks different from @xcite without being so . here , we shall work in the bjrken - drell convention for the spinors such that in lowest order of approximation holds @xmath60 , as opposed to the lepage - brodsky convention @xcite were one has @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , a factor of @xmath62 is missing in the denominator due to a typing - error in @xcite .",
    " as illustrated in fig.[fig:1 ] , the effective interaction scatters a single quark with four - momentum @xmath63 and spin - projection @xmath64 into a quark with ( @xmath65 ) , and correspondingly an antiquark from ( @xmath66 ) to ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions generated by eq.([eq:7 ] ) are identical with the probability amplitudes of the fock - state expansion for 3 colors , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath68 they depend on five entries : the three momenta of the quark and the two spin projections .",
    "one may or may not consider eq.([eq:7 ] ) as the point of orign for the present model .",
    "the principal aim of the present work is to generate solutions or reasonable approximations thereto .",
    "having been so explicit , the spin projections and their summation will be suppressed in the sequel as being performed implicitly .",
    "the integral equation can then be written more compactly as @xmath69 in practice it is inconvenient to deal with the invariant mass - squared eigenvalues since binding effects are so much overshadowed by the large value of the total free mass @xmath70 .",
    "it is therefore suggestive to substitute the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath22 by an other operator @xmath71 , which differs by the former only by a constant and a readjustment of scale , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 the ` hamiltonian ' @xmath71 will then have the dimension of a @xmath73 or @xmath74 ; in fact , as we shall see , it will have much in common with a non - relativistic hamiltonian without being one .",
    "since @xmath75 is a lorentz scalar , the approach continues to be frame independent .",
    "all what one does is to remodel the kinetic energy by @xmath76 without changing the substance , the integral equation becomes then @xmath77 the reduced mass @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 , as usually .",
    "the eigenvalue of invariant mass - squared @xmath80 and the eigenvalue of the energy @xmath81 are then related by @xmath82 , distinctly different from non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "the running coupling constant does not depend on whether one calculates it perturbatively in the usual coordinates or by light - cone methods and behaves for sufficiently large momentum transfer like @xcite @xmath83 with the value of @xmath84 as measured at the z - mass @xcite and three flavours ( @xmath85 ) , one gets @xmath86 the value of the ` qcd - scale ' @xmath87 is thus fixed and will not be changed during this work . but here is the problem : in a hamiltonian approach like the present one , one needs the interaction not only at large but also at small momentum transfer , including zero .",
    "taking the above functional at face value implies that hadronic interactions are _ repulsive _ for sufficiently small momentum transfer .",
    "this must plainly be wrong , of course , and the running must be modified .   but how ?   neither canonical renormalization theory nor the present dlcq - formalism has a ready - to - use answer , yet .",
    "we therefore modify it in the simplest possible way , inserting a constant at the right place : @xmath88 right or wrong , it does what one wants : the asymptotic behaviour is untouched and @xmath89 keeps its sign all the way down to @xmath90 .",
    "a similar step was taken by richardson @xcite for the instant form , but the value of @xmath87 was considered a free parameter . in the sequel",
    "we shall follow richardson setting @xmath91 , we shall however go much beyond that by including the correct fine- and hyperfine interaction .",
    "the change from eq.([eq:11 ] ) to eq.([eq:13 ] ) is the only assumption in the present work : despite not completely true , one could say that ` confinement is introduced by hand ' like in conventional potential models .",
    "the crucial difference to other models is that the correct asymptotic freedom @xcite is combined with the virtue of having no free parameter and some further pleasant aspects :    * the model depends only on the _ quark currents _ and is therefore manifestly gauge - invariant . *",
    "the model is formulated in the front form and therefore frame- and boost - invariant .",
    "* the usual ` recoil problem ' is absent in a momentum representation .",
    "finally , one should mention here already that the light - cone formalism has a different operator structure than the conventional instant form : the total angular momentum @xmath92 and its eigenvalues can not be used to classify the eigenstates .",
    "the non - initiated reader might find it quite surprizing that the wavefunctions _ can never be invariant _ under spatial rotations about the y- or the x - axis .",
    "like in other models , the flavor quark masses are free parameters subject to be determined by comparing with experiment .",
    "natural candidates are the pseudoscalar ( @xmath93 ) and vector mesons ( @xmath94 ) , which are believed to have total angular momentum @xmath95 .",
    "their total spin is thus @xmath96 . for two quarks",
    ", the total quark spin @xmath97 can only take the value @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "since the flavor quark masses potentially range from a few mev up to some 100 gev , one faces a tantalizing numerical problem : for any given set of quark and antiquark masses , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , one has to solve eq.([eq:7 ] ) and to perform a calculation of similar complexity as in .",
    "actually , in addition to that , one is confronted with thus far unresolved , technically highly non - trivial problems due to a @xmath102 singularity in the denominator . moreover , of all the calculated _ spectrum _ one only needs the _ lowest _ eigenvalue .",
    "only the latter will be compared with the physical meson mass @xmath103 .",
    "most of the calculated and thus expensive information is thus redundant , not to mention that the calculation will have to be repeated a zillion of times in order to fit @xmath100 and @xmath101 to @xmath103 .",
    " is there a simplier way ?",
    "the following analysis will pave the way for an ultimate , possibly analytical solution .",
    "the fundamental equation is unpleasant to the practitioner . in eq.([eq:7 ] ) two of the three integration variables are dimensionful ( @xmath104 ) and run from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , while the third one is dimensionless and has support only on the finite domain @xmath107 .",
    "it is therefore more than convenient to change variables from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , such that @xmath109 has the same support and dimension as @xmath110 .",
    "this can be achieved by @xmath111 the physical interpretation of @xmath109 is of secondary importance .",
    "one notes with pleasure that @xmath112 and @xmath113 produces the correct ` static value ' @xmath114 and that one can formally define a three - vector @xmath115 .",
    "the practitioner therefore will conclude that @xmath116 is ` something like ' the relative momentum in @xmath117-direction .",
    "the advantages are obvious , particularly the notation is more compact than in the standard front form .",
    "for example , the free part of the invariant mass squared appearing in eqs.([eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) becomes by direct substitution simply @xmath118 _ it looks as if _ one changes the single particle four - momentum state from the front form with @xmath119 and @xmath120 , to a state in the instant form with @xmath121 the transfer and the mean of three - momentum along the quark line is then given by @xmath122 respectively . along the antiquark line , both",
    "have the opposite sign .",
    "but all this does _ not imply _ that one works in the instant form .",
    "indeed , one has explicit residues from the front form , as follows .",
    "because of boost - invariance , eq.([eq:7 ] ) is independent of the total longitudinal momentum @xmath20 .",
    "but @xmath20 still lurks in the background , since the fock - states ` on the left ' ( @xmath123 ) have the same @xmath10 than those ` on the right ' ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "one can express this fact in instant form variables as well , using @xmath125 . since @xmath126 ,",
    "one is left with @xmath127 , and therefore has for every matrix element : @xmath128 because of the latter , one has also individually @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "obviously , the interaction _ does not change the size _ of @xmath131 , it only changes its direction : the frame - independent front - form formalism is equivalent to the center - of - mass frame of the instant form .",
    "this , of course , is a source of great simplification .",
    "for example , the momentum transfer and the mean momentum are always orthogonal , @xmath132 and four - momentum transfer is always identical with the three - momentum transfer .",
    "the latter is verified easily .",
    "one inserts the single four - momenta from eq.([eq:15 ] ) into the defining eq.([eq:10 ] ) and gets @xmath133 = \\vec q ^{\\;2 }   \\ , \\label { eq:20}\\ ] ] this way , the interaction @xmath134 depends _ only _ on the spatial momentum - transfer .",
    "it therefore must be our aim to express all functions appearing in the light - cone integral equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) as functions of the instant form variables @xmath131 and @xmath135 , _ i.e. _ to identically rewrite it as @xmath136 the notation can be chosen such that the jacobian @xmath137 and the current term @xmath138 are dimensionless with value ` 1 ' by lowest order of approximation , as will be unrevealed gradually .",
    "moreover , rather than by @xmath131 and @xmath135 , we shall express them often by the above @xmath139 and @xmath140 , since they have a very special meaning in integral equations like eq.([eq:54 ] ) , as follows .",
    "rewrite the latter conveniently as @xmath141 .",
    "multiply the whole equation with @xmath142 and subsequently integrate over @xmath143 . making use of the definition @xmath144 one straightforwardly arrives at an eigenvalue equation of the _ schrdinger type _ , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath145 thus , the analogue of @xmath139 is @xmath146 , the position of the particle in the center - of - mass frame , and @xmath140 is its conjugate momentum .",
    "consider for example the interaction term in eq.([eq:54 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath147 will hold to lowest order , see below , one gets @xmath148 the fourier transform generates a coulomb potential plus a confining potential with linearly rising walls , to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "this potential is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] versus @xmath149 .",
    "let us begin the programme with the kinetic energy @xmath150 .",
    "it is trivially a function only of @xmath131 .",
    "the cut - off function @xmath151 is related to the mass - scale @xmath152 introduced in eq.([eq:4 ] ) to render the hamiltonian matrix finite .",
    "the latter becomes now @xmath153 , which in turn can be cast identically into @xmath154 as expected , the cut - off is invariant under spatial rotations .",
    "next , using the gordon decomposition , the currents @xmath155 are conveniently decomposed into their convective and spin parts , @xmath156 due to the validity of eq.([eq:18 ] ) these expressions are simpler than usually . along the antiquark line",
    "one must change the sign of both @xmath157 and @xmath158 and can conveniently substitute @xmath159 by @xmath160 in order not to confuse the spin of quark and antiquark .",
    "the current term @xmath161 becomes then explicitly @xmath162 as one expects for a lorentz scalar it is invariant under spatial rotations .",
    "finally , the jacobian of the transformation eq.([eq:14 ] ) is evaluated in terms of the dimensionless transformation function @xmath163 , implicitly defined by @xmath164 by means of the identities @xmath165 one gets straightforwardly @xmath166 here @xmath167 is the only term which explicitly ` breaks ' rotational invariance since only here appears @xmath116 explicitly .",
    "this is no failure , but must be true for any front form hamiltonian . as a consequence , the wavefunction of the singlet state , for example , can not be strictly invariant under rotations in three - space .",
    "one even has numerical evidence for such a ` violation ' due to the pioneering work of krautgrtner : the singlet wavefunction displayed in his fig .",
    "11 show them clearly . first taken as a numerical artifact ,",
    "they are meanwhile confirmed by an independent and improved calculation @xcite . but these ` violations ' occur at a momentum scale much larger than the bohr momentum , in a region where the wavefunction is down typically to @xmath168 of its peak value .",
    "they seem to be unimportant .",
    "having defined all terms in eq.([eq:30 ] ) , it should be emphasized strongly that its solutions _ must be identical _ with those obtained from the original light - cone equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) , of course after having substituted @xmath169 back by @xmath170 according to eq.([eq:14 ] ) .",
    "it is however much simpler to deal with from the point of view of interpretation , of approximation , and last not least from the calculational point of view particularly for @xmath171 .",
    "the instant form has the garstly property of having square - roots scattered all over the place .",
    "this is particularly unpleasant when one aims at fourier transforms .",
    "can one find a systematic approximation scheme to remove them ?",
    " once more this is possible by means of the brodsky - lapage cut - off . indeed",
    ", one always can choose @xmath152 such that @xmath172 if this holds for the lighter particle it even more so holds for the heavier one .",
    "all square - roots can then be expanded safely , _",
    "_ @xmath173 this looks like a non - relativistic approximation but the opposite is true : in the worst case , our choice allows for the ultra - relativistic velocities of the lighter particle up to @xmath174 on the one hand , and on the other hand for a consistent and systematic expansion up to second order like @xmath175 respectively .",
    "the expansion of the current term @xmath176 of eq.([eq:64 ] ) and of the product of the current with the jacobian run analogously and give @xmath177 respectively .",
    "for completeness we finally define @xmath178 , the kinetic energy @xmath46 , and @xmath179 : @xmath180 the last step needs a comment . after having expanded in the manner of eq.([eq:403 ] ) one has to verify in principle , that the results depend on the cut - off @xmath152 at most weekly .",
    "one can conjecture however that the wavefunction decays sufficiently fast as to act itself like a cut - off .",
    "one thus can drop @xmath152 at this stage .",
    "all one has to do at the end of a calculation is to check the condition set in eq.([eq:403 ] ) , but this can and will be done by an expectation value .",
    "one now is prepared to fourier transform the whole eq.([eq:54 ] ) into an eigenvalue equation of the schrdinger type @xmath181 when transforming a momentum - space function like @xmath182 one gets in a first step @xmath183 . by definition ,",
    "the operator @xmath184 can act _ only _ on the next @xmath185 to the right . since @xmath186 is spherically symmetric one sets @xmath187 and absorbs @xmath146 into the angular momentum operator @xmath188 . the hamiltonian operator @xmath71 in ` schrdinger representation ' ( with @xmath189 ) turns then out as @xmath190 for a spherical @xmath185 holds @xmath191 and with @xmath192 one arrives at @xmath193 the rotationally asymmetric @xmath194 is given below",
    "we emphasize here already that the precise form of @xmath185 need not be known in performing the step from eq.([eq:409 ] ) to eq.([eq:414 ] ) .",
    "if one sticks to qcd in the above form , eq.([eq:32 ] ) , one has @xmath195 if one sticks to qed , one chooses @xmath196 and sets the qcd - scale @xmath87 to zero .",
    "these equations are at the core of the present work .",
    "they are still identical with the original equations ( [ eq:30 ] ) or ( [ eq:54 ] ) and include the correct retardation without smallness asumptions particularly on the coupling constant or the mass parameters .",
    "the ` retarded schrdinger equation ' has a wonderfully simple structure and can be interpreted with ease .",
    "one notes that the ` potential ' @xmath186 plays a different role in the different terms of the equation .",
    "the first term is the kinetic energy . like in non - relatistic",
    "quantum mechanics the reduced mass governs the scale . here",
    "the potential plays the role of an ` effective mass ' . in the second term @xmath186",
    "appears in its natural role as a potential energy with an attractive coulomb and a linear string potential . in the second last term ,",
    "the analogue of the ` fine interactions ' of atomic physics , the potential plays the role of a coupling constant for the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "last not least , in the third and the fourth term one finds the analogues of the atomic ` hyperfine interaction ' with the difference that they become of leading importance in the hadronic case .",
    "they contribute in the third term to the true potential energy and for example modify the ` coulomb ' part of @xmath186 , while the coefficient of @xmath197 can be interpreted as a ( color- ) magnetic interaction of the two spins .",
    "one should note that some parts of the retarded schrdinger equation are a direct consequence of working in the front form .",
    "we have tried to account for that in the notation . in eq.([eq:408 ] ) , for example , one notes that the current term has no contribution in @xmath198 , while eq.([eq:409 ] ) does contain a term like that .",
    "they are caused by the explicit appearance of the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath108 , _",
    "i.e. _ are caused by the jacobian @xmath199 .",
    "the asymmetry hamiltonian @xmath194 has the same orign , and following eq.([eq:405 ] ) has the fourier transform @xmath200 it looks like a self - induced hadronic interaction of the quadrupole type .",
    "how serious is the retarded schrdinger equation to be taken ?   we have actually no argument what could have been done wrong in the above , certainly nothing on purpose or with an unjustified assumption . at the very bottom",
    "the omission of zero - modes and , perhaps more important , the omission of the two - gluon effective annihilation graph might perhaps be influential , and has to be investigated in the future .",
    "but not even the ` richardson potential ' can be crucial .",
    "small distances @xmath201 correspond to large momenta in fourier space , and at least there asymptotic freedom must be correct . in the opposite limit , at very large distances corresponding to small momenta in fourier space , the detailed form of the running coupling",
    "constant might possibly matter .",
    "but there , the bound - state wavefunction is small from the outset and possible effects are unlikely to become important .",
    "not even the consistent expansion to second order in the momenta is an assumption , since it can and must be checked _",
    "a posteriori _ by @xmath202 one thus has to live with these equations . rather than to agonize further on these almost philosophical matters , to which we shall come back in the summary",
    ", we proceed now by asking for practical consequences .",
    "it will take some time and effort to work out all the many consequences of the retarded schrdinger equation ( [ eq:414 ] ) , which as mentioned should hold both for qed and qcd . in the sequel ,",
    "we therefore shall restrict ourselves to calculate only the ground - state masses of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "if one leaves aside the recently discovered top - quark @xmath203 and restricts to 5 flavors ( @xmath204 ) , one has thus 30 different physical mesons , since charge - conjugate hadrons have of course the same mass .",
    "one can not calculate these masses , however , without knowing the mass parameters @xmath205 and @xmath206 of the quarks .",
    "these can not be measured in a model - independent way , although some people pretend one can do so . here",
    ", we shall adopt the point of view that the quark masses have to be determined consistently within each model , for the better or the worse .",
    "one has thus 5 mass parameters to account for 30 physical masses .",
    "which ones should be selected to fit ?",
    " there are 142  506 different possibilities to select 5 members from a set of 30 , and we have to make a choice : we choose the five pure @xmath35-pairs . even that is not unique",
    ": shall one take the pseudoscalar ( @xmath207 ) or the vector mesons ( @xmath208 ) ?",
    " we shall take both , and compare the results .",
    "but doing so , one runs into the problem of choosing the chiral composition of the physical hadrons .",
    "one would be rather surprized if the pions , for example , could be understood as eigenstates in a simple potential model like retarded schrdinger equation ( [ eq:414 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the aim to avoid hell s kitchen by choosing a certain flavor composition , we shall do even worse and replace the ` pions ' , for example , by ` quasi - pions ' with the same physical mass : all our hadrons shall be pure @xmath35-pairs   _ by fiat_. for example , we shall identify the @xmath209- , @xmath210- , @xmath211- , or @xmath212-eigenstates with the quasi-@xmath213 , quasi-@xmath214 , quasi-@xmath215 , or the quasi-@xmath216 , and so on .",
    "these ` crimes ' can be revoked easily in future though not the present work .",
    "they are by no means compulsory to the model , as we shall see .",
    "our problems lie in another ball park .",
    "it is clear that we can not deal head - on with the full complexity of the retarded schrdinger equation ( [ eq:414 ] ) .",
    "which part of the hamiltonian should one select in a first assault ?  ",
    "some help is gained by the rather unique property of the light - cone hamiltonian : kinetic energy and interaction are additive , and so is the hamiltonian . because of this additivity one always can select an ` interesting part ' @xmath217 , _ i.e. _ @xmath218 and check _ a posteriori _ , by calculating @xmath219 in perturbation theory , whether the selection makes sense , or not .    since the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons have probably no orbital excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ are primarily @xmath220-waves , one can disregard the spin - orbit couplings and choose @xmath221 even that looks to complicated for a start - up .",
    "we therefore select those terms which in one way or the other have turned out to be important in past phenomenological work , namely a simple central potential plus the triplet - interaction mediated by the total spin .",
    "our first choice is therefore @xmath222 it is always possible to choose a spinorial representation in which @xmath223 and @xmath224 become diagonal . in this case , the latter can be replaced by the eigenvalue @xmath225 , taking the values 0 and 2 for the singlet and the triplet , respectively .",
    "how does the wavefunction for the lowest state look like ?",
    " for a pure coulomb potential , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath226 , the solution has the form @xmath227 one the other hand , ommitting the coulomb part , a linear potential be solved in terms of airy functions or its integral transforms @xcite .",
    "if one has both , one will have some mixture of the two . in a numerical calculation , these can be found with almost arbitrary accuracy .",
    "but for the present start - up check even that requires too much effort .      & 2.3 & 155.6 & 430.6 & 1642.3 & 5330.8 +    ' '' ''    from  fit  to  @xmath208   & 222.8 & 236.2 & 427.2 & 1701.3 & 5328.2 +    rather we shall pursue a variational approach .",
    "we choose eq.([eq:503 ] ) as a one - dimensional parameter family , subject to determine the one free parameter @xmath228 .",
    "of course , one could take other families as well , like for example harmonic oscillator eigenstates , but with the above all expectation values are particularly simple , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath229 that s all what one needs to calculate the expectation value of the energy @xmath230 since we deal only with a variational approach to the ground states , we are not in conflict with the statement that the wavefunction can not be purely coulombic .",
    "for the pure coulomb case , the 2@xmath97- and 1@xmath231-states would be degenerate and the ratio @xmath232 , as opposed to the values @xmath233 and @xmath234 extracted from experiments on charmonium and bottomium @xcite , respectively .    since we address ourselves to calculate the total invariant mass of the hadrons we return to the front form invariant mass - squared operator @xmath235 , _",
    "i.e. _ to @xmath236 . specializing now to equal masses @xmath237 one preferably converts the variational equation ( [ eq:505 ] ) in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath238 we measure thus all energies and masses in units of the one fixed scale in our problem , the qcd scale @xmath87 .",
    "the variational eigenvalue equation reduces then to the handy expression @xmath239 at fixed values of the parameters ( @xmath240 ) , the variable @xmath228 and thus @xmath220 must be varied such that the energy ( or the mass ) become stationary , _",
    "@xmath241 this leads to a cubic equation in @xmath242 which can be solved analytically in terms of cardan s formula . in special cases they",
    "can well be approximated by a quadratic equation , namely when @xmath243 or when @xmath244 .",
    "we got accustomed to refer to these _ two regimes _ as the _ bohr _ and the _ string regime _ , respectively . in the bohr regime",
    "the coulomb potential dominates the solution and the linear string potential provides a correction . in the string regime",
    "the linear string potential dominates , with the coulomb potential giving a correction .",
    "solutions in the string regime , however , imply that the ratio @xmath245 becomes so large that one is in conflict with the validity condition eq.([eq:417 ] ) .",
    "[ t ]     & s & c & b +  & 293 & 1.45 & 0.53 & 0.25 & 0.22 +    ' '' ''    for  fit  to  @xmath208  & 0.79 & 0.76 & 0.48 & 0.25 & 0.22 +    rather than to give explicitly the straightforward but cumbersome formalism , we present the analytical results in the graphical form of figure  [ fig:3 ] , both for the singlet and the triplet",
    ". as displayed there , the total mass @xmath246 is almost linear in the quark mass , with small but significant deviations . in line with expectation , the hyperfine splitting decreases with increasing quark mass . less expected was that the splitting increases so strongly with decreasing quark mass .",
    "as one can see in the figure , the mass of the singlet states takes off from the value 0 at vanishing mass almost like a square - root as opposed to the triplets which start off at a finite value .",
    "therefore , if one determines the mass of the @xmath247-quark by fitting to the quasi - pion mass , as displayed in table  [ tab:1 ] , the value of @xmath220 becomes extremely small .",
    "consequently , one is in the string regime and the @xmath247-quark becomes ultra - relativistic .",
    "the validity condition is then badly violated , as compiled in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of the up - quark mass is rather close to what is reported for the so called ` current mass ' . for the @xmath216 and the @xmath248 ,",
    "the scaling variable @xmath220 is of order unity , while for the quasi-@xmath249 one definitely is in the bohr regime . here",
    "the masses are similar or close to what is referred as the ` constituent - quark ' mass .",
    "since singlet and triplet are so close for @xmath250 and since nobody wants to fit the pion anyway , quasi or not , one fits the quark masses preferentially with the vector mesons . in the lack of empirical data",
    "we have set @xmath251 , which should be of minor importance in the present model , see figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "as seen from table  [ tab:1 ] , the flavor masses are now in close agreement with the constituent quark masses , particularly the up- and down - quarks . as compiled in table  [ tab:2 ] , the smallness condition is now satisfied excellently , everywhere .",
    "obviously , it would be a minor modification to introduce some preferred chiral structure of the light mesons , and to drop the simple and simple - minded construction of quasi - mesons .",
    "but we have an other objection , here .",
    "we ask : with the so fixed flavor quark masses , how bad or how good are the remaining 25 meson masses described ?   the procedure runs quite analogously , except that it is now easier . with fixed masses ,",
    "one varies @xmath228 in eq.([eq:505 ] ) such that the energy becomes stationary .",
    "of course , this has to be done separately for each flavor composition .",
    "we compile the results in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "the table contains also a comparison with the experimental values , to the extent the latter are known .",
    "it is clear why one should exempt the quasi - pions from a detailed comparison with data , but for the rest it was not really anticipated that they would agree on the level of about one part in hundred .",
    "some of these mesons have not yet been found .",
    "the present model predicts then for example @xmath252 such a table was not given before . in all due respect for the work with lattice gauge theory ,",
    "the agreement of the above equations with data is not so much worse , particularly in view of their simplicity and the absence of any free parameters .",
    "applying dlcq to qcd in the light - cone gauge @xmath253 and disregarding _ zero modes _ , one derives first an effective interaction acting in the @xmath35 space .",
    "we emphasize that no assumption on a possible smallness of the coupling constant has to be made , nor that it is necessary to truncate the fock space in the manner of tamm @xcite and of dancoff @xcite .",
    "gauge invariance , therefore , is _ not _ violated .",
    "once this is achieved , one can drop discretization and convert the matrix into an integral equation , eq.([eq:8 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately we can not be more explicit in the present context .",
    "we therefore consider this equation as part of the model and the point of departure in the present work .",
    " we discover next a simple substitution of integration variables , eq.([eq:14 ] ) , which allows to transmute the equation identically into eq.([eq:54 ] ) , in which appear only the conventional instant form variables like the usual momenta and energies .",
    "one wishes to fourier transform the still front form equations to usual space coordinates but is hampered by the ` square roots ' .",
    "a poor man s solution is their consistent expansion up to second order .",
    "the prize to pay is eq.([eq:417 ] ) , _ i.e. _ a smallness requirement _ a posteriori _ which has to be met in the solution .",
    "one ends up with a differential equation in configuration space , eq.([eq:501 ] ) , which looks like a non - relativistic schrdinger equation without being one .",
    "it contains the full retardation of a relativistically correct front form equation , and therefore is referred to as the retarded schrdinger equation .",
    "its solutions can be fourier transformed back to momentum space and subjected to the transmutation equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) , to get the wavefunction expressed in light - cone momenta particularly longitudinal momentum fractions , which are needed so urgently for the theoretical predictions of experimental high - energy cross sections , and of structure functions and the like .",
    "one should emphasize that the retarded schrdinger equation has no free parameter : the coupling constant and the quark masses have to be determined from the experiment .",
    "like in the familiar quantum electro - dynamics one has no way to calculate them .",
    "fitting the strong coupling constant at the z - mass and the 5 quark flavor masses to 5 selected vector mesons fixes all our freedom .",
    "the rest is structure : the 20 remaining pseudoscalar or vector masses are then predicted and presented in table  [ tab:4 ] . in comparison with the experimental data they are not much worse than those from conventional phenomenological models @xcite , or from heavy quark symmetry @xcite , or even from lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "the pions , of course , remain mysterious particles like in every other model not specially designed for them .",
    "one wishes now to solve the full retarded schrdinger equation ( [ eq:501 ] ) rather than only its caricature in eq.([eq:502 ] ) .",
    "conclusion : if such a poor model can do so well one must be on the right track .",
    "it seems that the front form and dlcq have made a big step forward .",
    "unfortunately , it took ten years but one has been faced with all the problems of formulating a hamiltonian approach to gauge field theory , in addition to the problems inherent to the front form .",
    "hcp thanks stanley  j.  brodsky for the many discussions and exchange of ideas over all those ten years particularly for his patience in listening to the ideas still vague at the time of the kyffhuser meeting .",
    "`` of course '' , he said , `` that s what richardson did . ''",
