    "for investigating the spin structure in the nucleon , quark and gluon spin components are determined by global analysis using the asymmetry data from deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the quark component @xmath2 is determined well by present experimental data ; however , the gluon component @xmath3 is not obtained with enough accuracy and still has large uncertainty .",
    "difficulty of the determination of @xmath3 is caused by narrow @xmath4 rage of polarized dis data compared with the unpolarized data , because the polarized gluon distribution @xmath5 contributes to the structure function @xmath6 via @xmath4 evolution given by the dglap equation .",
    "therefore , we need experimental data sensitive to the gluon distribution , for example , in hadron , jet , and prompt photon production of polarized proton - proton collisions . fortunately , the asymmetry data of @xmath1 production are measured by the phenix collaboration at rhic @xcite .",
    "since impact of the data on determination of @xmath3 is interesting , we perform a global analysis with dis and @xmath1 asymmetry data and estimate uncertainties of the polarized parton distribution functions ( polarized pdfs ) @xcite .",
    "for discussing the impact of the @xmath1 data , we perform two analyses . one is the analysis using only the dis data , and the other uses the dis and @xmath1 asymmetry data . in these analyses , we assume two constraint conditions .",
    "one is positivity condition .",
    "it is required as constraint on the large-@xmath7 behavior of the polarized pdfs because the obtained dis asymmetry tends to exceed one due to low accuracy of the experimental data in the large-@xmath7 region .",
    "the other condition is @xmath8 flavor symmetry for the polarized antiquark distributions because of the low accuracy for flavor separation of the antiquark distributions .",
    "moreover , the current @xmath1 data are insensitive to flavor structure of the polarized pdfs because the precise data exist in the low-@xmath9 region where the gluon - gluon scattering process dominates . in our analysis , the dis asymmetry are calculated in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of @xmath10 , and nlo cross sections of the @xmath1 production are estimated by using the k factor method .",
    "uncertainties of the polarized pdfs are estimated by the hessian method .",
    "the polarized pdfs are optimized by @xmath11 analysis , and values of @xmath12 are 0.904 for only dis data and",
    "0.891 for dis@xmath13 data .",
    "figure [ fig : xdg-1&2 ] shows the comparison of the gluon distributions between two analyses . while the distribution itself varies slightly",
    ", its uncertainty is significantly reduced .",
    "obtained @xmath3 is @xmath14 for the only dis data , and @xmath15 for the dis@xmath13 data .",
    "it is clear that the uncertainty of @xmath3 is significantly reduced due to adding the @xmath1 data .",
    "this fact implies that the @xmath1 data has great impact on the determination of @xmath0 in comparison with the present dis data .",
    "solid curve is @xmath16 for dis@xmath13 , and dotted curve is one for only dis data . covered areas by upper and lower curves are these uncertainties.,width=226 ]    there is , however , a problem in the analysis using the @xmath1 data .",
    "although above results are obtained by assuming the positive distribution for @xmath0 , negative distribution can be allowed as a solution of @xmath0 . this is because that the @xmath17 scattering process dominates in the low-@xmath9 region , so that the polarized cross section is roughly proportional to square of the gluon distribution : @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , there are two solutions : positive and negative solutions . in practice",
    ", we perform the analysis assuming negative gluon input at initial scale .",
    "the value of minimized @xmath11 of the @xmath1 data is 11.05 for eight data points , and it is almost the same as the positive solution which is 11.18 .",
    "next , the obtained asymmetries are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asympi0 ] .",
    "the solid curve is the asymmetry of the positive solution , and the dotted - dashed is one of the negative solution .",
    "although the positive solution passes through the region between the second and third data points , the negative solution becomes small negative to fit the second data point .",
    "there are not large difference between the @xmath11 values and the behavior of the asymmetry for both solutions ; therefore , we can not choose a solution at this stage .",
    "asymmetries between two solutions .",
    "experimental data are measured by the phenix collaboration at @xmath19 gev @xcite.,width=226 ]        negative asymmetry caused by functional forms of the gluon distribution is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a distribution with a node is suggested .",
    "we find indeed such a distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xdg-23 ] . as a negative solution",
    ", the distribution has a node at @xmath20 and becomes negative in the small-@xmath7 region .",
    "its uncertainty is large in this small-@xmath7 region .",
    "the values of @xmath3 is @xmath21 .",
    "it indicates negative value , however it has large uncertainty coming from the ambiguity of the small-@xmath7 behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xdg-23 ] .    for discussing reliability of the @xmath3 determination",
    ", we estimate the @xmath3 in the following @xmath7 range ; @xmath22 .",
    "these values are almost the same : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "next , the comparison of the polarization of the gluon distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgog ] . experimental data are measured by di - hadron production in semi - inclusive dis process . although these data are not included in the analysis , two solutions are consistent with the data within these uncertainties .",
    "furthermore these curves seem to be same behavior in the limited @xmath7 range .",
    "the range is covered by the dis and @xmath1 data ; therefore , similar solutions are obtained in this rage .",
    "the ambiguity of @xmath3 comes from no constraint of the @xmath1 data in the small-@xmath7 region .",
    "note that analysis using hadron production has ambiguity of fragmentation function sets .",
    "we should take care of the ambiguity for determination of @xmath0 . in this sense",
    ", jet production plays an important role in the determination without the ambiguity because the fragmentation functions are not needed to calculation of jet cross sections .     for the positive and negative solutions.,width=226 ]",
    "in order to determine the polarized gluon distribution , we performed global analysis using present dis and @xmath1 asymmetry data . although the uncertainty of the gluon distribution is reduced by adding the @xmath1 data , the sign problem occurs .",
    "the positive and negative @xmath3 are allowed at this stage .",
    "however , we obtain consistent results for two solutions in the region @xmath25 which is covered by the present experimental data .",
    "the difference of the sign comes from the extrapolated behavior of the gluon distribution in the smaller-@xmath7 region . in the region , there is no constraint on the gluon distribution . in order to reduce the large uncertainty ,",
    "experimental data covering a wide rage of @xmath7 are required .",
    "in particular , the data in low @xmath9 at @xmath26 gev will provide a constraint on the small-@xmath7 behavior .",
