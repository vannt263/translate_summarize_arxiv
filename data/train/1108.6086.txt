    "in addition , these galaxies have bulges , which can often contain 50% of the light ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but the presence of disk sets these galaxies apart from the more massive elliptical galaxies . in contrast , the most massive galaxies are generally much rounder systems that are triaxial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* vdw09 ) found that there is a threshold mass for the formation of early - type disk galaxies , a result which has been indicated in earlier work @xcite . for galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath6 , there is a broad distribution of projected axis - ratios .",
    "this implies that intrinsically flat systems , such disks or flattened ellipticals , populate these masses . above that mass ,",
    "however , galaxies become distinctly rounder .",
    "@xcite find that this threshold mass is apparent in not just the projected axis - ratio , but in properties of the stellar population such as the color and color - gradients .",
    "the implication is that the most massive passively evolving galaxies are the result of a different formation process than the galaxies below this mass threshold . if one assumes that round galaxies are a result of mergers , than the apparent ceiling in the mass distribution of disk galaxies reflects the limit in mass for disky systems .",
    "the process of galaxy formation , therefore , sets a mass scale above which multiple mergers are the apparently only method of mass assembly .",
    "there is significant evidence for evolution of number density of passively evolving @xmath9 galaxies in field surveys @xcite .",
    "this evolution can occur via two paths , namely the process of merging building up red - sequence or of star - forming spiral galaxies being transformed into red - sequence galaxies with the cessation of star - formation ( see * ? ? ? * for a more thorough discussion ) . by examining the evolution of the threshold mass as found by vdw09 , we can trace out the relative importance of these different formation channels over time .",
    "we have investigated this question by compiling mass - limited samples of passively evolving galaxies from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in a variety of environments .",
    "we will use the projected axis - ratio measurements , which have been robustly tested in previous work ( * ? ? ?",

    "we require that galaxies are in the photometric redshift range @xmath17 , have 2@xmath18 k - band detections , which removes those objects in noisy parts of the image , lie within the b , v , and r images , and have good photometric redshifts .",

    ". we will refer to these magnitudes and colors with subscript 0 , such as @xmath20 . to compute these values",
    ", we build on the approach we have used in the past , see for example @xcite , or @xcite . to compute the conversion",
    ", we use @xcite stellar populations with a variety of @xmath21 models and a range of metallicities . at each redshift of interest",
    ", we compute the relation between a pair of observed magnitudes and a rest - frame magnitude of the following form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnitude of interest at @xmath10 and @xmath24 is the observed magnitude that is closest to covering the same portion of the galaxy spectral energy distribution at a given redshift @xmath25 .",

    ", we can calculate a unique conversion for each galaxy based on its observed redshift and colors .",
    "then , we add @xmath29 to each magnitude .      to select galaxies that have very little or no star - formation activity , we follow the now commonly adopted approach to define a region in color - color space that effectively separates such galaxies from star - forming galaxies @xcite . in figure [ urz ]",
    "we show the rest - frame @xmath20 and @xmath30 color distribution of the full sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample at @xmath2 , computed as described above from the sdss model magnitudes .",
    "quiescent galaxies populate a small region of color - color space as indicated by the pronounced dark area in the figure .",
    "star - forming galaxies populate a much more extended , yet fairly narrow sequence .",
    "@xcite has shown that the galaxies in the quiescent region are morphologically like early - type or elliptical and s0 galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , for the rest of this paper , we will refer to galaxies in that region as early - type systems .      in order to define the optimal color - color selection criteria and establish the reliability of using these criteria to select quiescent galaxies , we compare the color - color distribution with the h@xmath32 detection rate . in figure [ urz ]",
    "we show the color - color distribution of galaxies that are detected in h@xmath32 ( at the 2.5@xmath18 level : @xmath33 ) with blue contours and those that are below that detection threshold in red .",
    "we define a polygon to photometrically select quiescent galaxies as shown in the figure , with the location of the three segments  but not the slope of the tilted segment , which is chosen to run parallel to the star - forming sequence  as free parameters .",
    "we then calculate the fraction of h@xmath32 emitters contained within the polygon ( the contaminating fraction @xmath34 ) and the fraction of h@xmath32-less galaxies outside the polygon ( the missing fraction @xmath35 ) for a each set of polygon parameters .",
    "the optimal parameter values found by minimizing @xmath36 , which ensures that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are essentially equal while their sum is minimized .    for the full spectroscopic sample , the optimal color - color selection criteria are described by the polygon @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with contaminating and missing fractions of @xmath40 .",
    "the color - color distribution peaks at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which is computed by finding the maximum in density of the color - color distribution after integrating over a circle with radius 0.03 mag , the approximate relative error in the colors .",
    "if we pre - select galaxies with a certain minimum stellar mass ( see below ) , the polygon does not change by more than 0.02 mag up until the minimum mass reaches very large values ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the contaminating and missing fractions have a mild dependence , and increase from @xmath44 to @xmath45 if the minimum mass increases from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .    a simple red - sequence selection has a much higher contamination rate .",
    "if we use only the @xmath48 selection , our sample has a higher success rate , we miss only 0.03 of the early - type sample , but at a cost of a contamination fraction of 0.37 .",
    "such a high fraction of star - forming galaxies in red - sequence selections has been seen before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the above results for the sdss sample to define the appropriate color - color selection criteria for the gems and cosmos surveys .",
    "for consistency with the sdss , we derive rest - frame @xmath20 and @xmath30 color ( as well as stellar masses , see below ) using the public photometric redshift estimates for both the gems and cosmos surveys .",
    "the color - color distributions for the gems and cosmos samples are shown in figure [ highz ] , where a similar peaked distribution in color - color space indicates the presence of a quiescent population of galaxies .",
    "of course , we do not have the luxury to compare color - color selection criteria with h@xmath32 line strengths at @xmath50 .",
    "instead we shift the polygon defined above in both @xmath20 and @xmath30 by the difference in the location of the density peaks in the color - color distribution between high-@xmath25 samples and the sdss sample . for gems , the color - color distribution peaks at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and for cosmos at @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as with the sdss , we determine these centroids by integrating over a circle with radius 0.03 mag .",
    "these numbers do not change by more than 0.01 - 0.02 mag in case errors in the color of 0.05 ma are assumed .",
    "there is an unfortunate difference in the locations of the quiescent galaxies in color - color space between the gems and cosmos samples .",
    "this difference should be attributed to systematic effects in the photometry , which would be of the level of @xmath55 .",
    "however , our method to define the color - color selection criteria for quiescent galaxies ensures that these systematic effects do not affect our sample selection and analysis .",
    "the dr7 catalog of @xcite provides stellar mass estimates for the galaxies in our sdss sample .",
    "these estimates use a new methodology for dr7 , namely the spectral energy distributions are fit to the broad band photometry similar to the implementation of @xcite instead of using only the spectra as was done in the past .",
    "these differences are documented at http://www.mpa - garching.mpg.de / sdss / dr7/. the model fit to the photometric data yields a distribution .",
    "we select the median mass value as the best estimate with the 16 and 84 percentile confidence limits as estimates of the errors .    in figure [ mlrgmr ]",
    "can be seen that quiescent galaxies obey a tight relation between color and stellar mass - to - light ratio  this is obviously inherent to the method .",
    "we derive a linear relation by computing the biweight mean in narrow color bins ( 0.02 mag wide ) over the range @xmath56 , where the sequence is well populated .",
    "a fit that minimizes the scatter in the biweight yields : @xmath57 .",
    "the scatter decreases from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in @xmath60 over the probed color range .    for our high redshift samples",
    ", we would like to estimate stellar masses consistently .",
    "however , we can not directly use the above relation because quiescent galaxies at @xmath15 have had different star formation histories than their present - day counterparts , because , if nothing else , the universe was younger .",
    "we use independent constraints on the evolution of @xmath61 and @xmath62 to convert the above relation between color and @xmath63 for @xmath64 galaxies to one appropriate for @xmath15 galaxies .",
    "we take the evolution in @xmath62 from the recently derived fundamental plane evolution by @xcite : @xmath65 .",
    "we infer the @xmath61 color evolution by computing the biweight mean of the photometrically selected sdss , gems , and cosmos samples , for which find , respectively , @xmath66 , 0.61 , and 0.60 .",
    "thus , we shift the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath62 shown in figure [ mlrgmr ] to the left by 0.14 ( cosmos ) or 0.15 ( gems ) mag , and down by 0.38 dex , resulting in stellar mass estimates that are @xmath67 dex lower at @xmath15 than those for @xmath64 at the same @xmath61 color .    to estimate errors on the stellar masses for the high redshift samples , we use the scatter in the @xmath62 versus @xmath68 relation at a the color of a given galaxy .",
    "this scatter is done in the relation after it is shifted by the mean @xmath68 color and @xmath63 evolution .",
    "we then add in quadrature the uncertainties in the zero point of the @xmath63 evolution .",
    "thus the error in the high redshift stellar masses range from 0.06 to 0.11 dex depending on the color of the galaxy .",
    "if use the @xmath63 evolution from the field sample of @xcite , we would estimate smaller masses at @xmath69 by 0.02 dex , a small systematic shift .",
    "this difference is in good agreement with the statistical errors of the @xcite and @xcite samples .",
    "-@xmath62 relation for early - type galaxies in sdss ( @xmath70 ; @xmath2 ) selected by their @xmath48 and @xmath71 colors ( see figure [ urz ] ) .",
    "the solid line is the best - fitting relation . to estimate masses for our @xmath50 masses from cosmos and gems in a consistent manner we use the dashed line which has the same slope but a different zero point to compensate for evolution in the color and the mass - to - light ratio as explained in the text .",
    "[ mlrgmr],width=288 ]      our projected axis - ratio measurements , @xmath72 , come from two approaches . for the gems and cosmos samples , these values are the result of fitting srsic models @xcite to the two - dimensional images using the software galfit @xcite . for the sdss catalog ,",
    "we use the estimates from fitting a de vaucouleurs model as part of the sdss dr7 photometric pipeline @xcite .",
    "the gems fits are contained in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "these are done using galfit as part of larger package known as galapagosm.barden/galapagos/ ] .",
    "galapagos has the advantage of automating the catalog construction and model fitting process .",
    "the software automatically fits neighboring objects and incorporates its own sky subtraction algorithm in order to ensure robust parameter measurements .",
    "a more thorough discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xcite used galapagos to produce publicly available catalogs for both cosmos and gems .",
    "we will use the catalog of @xcite for cosmos and the catalog of @xcite for gems , though , as we show below , there is no measurable difference between the @xcite and the @xcite catalogs .",
    "our analysis hinges on the consistent measurement of the axis - ratios of galaxies at very different redshifts and from very different imaging data sets . in @xcite",
    ", we tested our our axis - ratio measurements from galfit with simulations of observations of high redshift galaxies using real low redshift galaxies as templates .",
    "we found these measurements to be robust , with a negligible shift in the axis - ratio from @xmath10 to @xmath11 of @xmath73 with a scatter of @xmath74 depending on galaxy magnitude .",
    "in addition to data - related differences , the fitting algorithms also differ between the low- and high - redshift galaxy samples .",
    "we use the adaption of galapagos for sdss imaging from @xcite to measure the axis - ratios of a sub - sample of our sdss galaxies in a manner that is fully consistent with the treatment of the high - redshift galaxies . for small axis - ratios ,",
    "systematic differences are expected to be largest .",
    "therefore , we select 412 sdss galaxies from our sample with axis - ratios @xmath75 as determined by the sdss pipeline .",
    "these represent the extreme end of the distribution , where systematic differences in fitting procedures or the point spread function should be the most manifest .",
    "the axis - ratio measurements from galapagos are fully consistent with the sdss pipeline measurements : @xmath76 , where 0.03 is the root mean - squared scatter .",
    "galapagos includes many free parameters that affect source detection , sky subtraction and treatment of neighbors .",
    "however , regardless of the different set ups that @xcite and @xcite used for the gems data set , there is no systematic difference between the two catalogs for the objects in our sample ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "a final test of the robustness of our measurements is a comparison between axis - ratio measurements from those galaxies in the gems that lie within the much deeper acs images from goods @xcite .",
    "the difference is @xmath78 with a scatter of @xmath79 .",
    "the negligible systematic difference is encouraging .",
    "summarizing , all tests and simulations stress that our axis - ratio measurements across the different data sets at different redshifts and performed with different algorithms , are internally fully consistent .",
    "we would like to measure evolution of the axis - ratio as a function of stellar mass . in order to probe as far down the mass function as possible ,",
    "we need to limit our sample to above the mass limit where the initial survey photometry is complete .    for the sdss",
    ", we find that our sample will have no bias as a function of redshift for early - type galaxies with a mass of @xmath80 for the whole redshift range of @xmath2 .",
    "this means that galaxies above that mass range have an equal probability of being included regardless of redshift . for the mass of @xmath81 ,",
    "this is correct for only the redshift range of @xmath82 . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we will include the whole sample to first mass limit , @xmath83 .",
    "for the mass range @xmath84 we limit the redshift range to @xmath82 .    at higher redshifts , we have two different samples with two different selections .",
    "the gems sample was selected using a @xmath85 limiting magnitude .",
    "in contrast , the catalog from cosmos we use was based on a combination of @xmath86 and 3.6 @xmath87 m imaging . combining the completeness computations from @xcite with the 3.6 @xmath87 m magnitude distribution of galaxies with masses @xmath88",
    ", we infer that our sample is complete in this mass range .",
    "we adopt @xmath89 as our mass limit . from a similar estimate for the gems sample",
    "we infer a completeness limit of @xmath83 . for the rest of this paper ,",
    "when we compare samples with masses @xmath7 , we will be comparing the whole sdss sample with the combined gems and cosmos sample .",
    "for masses below that limit , we are only comparing a subset of the sdss sample with @xmath82 with the cosmos sample .      in star - forming disk galaxies ,",
    "dust is often concentrated in the mid - plane .",
    "this causes a strong color - dependence in the axis - ratio .",
    "for example , @xcite finds a slope of @xmath90 - 0.5 in the @xmath48 color with @xmath72 .    for our sample of early - type sdss galaxies , we find that the slopes of the @xmath48 axis - ratio relation are small , -0.07 to -0.09 magnitudes , depending on galaxy mass .",
    "thus , rounder galaxies are mildly bluer than thinner galaxies .",
    "these shallow slopes for our early - type population has two implications .",
    "first , the completeness our sample is not drastically impacted by the apparent axis - ratio of the galaxy .",
    "second , that our sample of early - type galaxies are optically thin .",
    "this second criteria implies that the selection in color - color space removes galaxies with significant amounts of gas and dust , which is typical for passively - evolving systems .",
    "though the slopes of the @xmath48 color with axis - ratio are small in our sdss dr7 sample , they still could be the result of our color - color selection .",
    "therefore , we measured the relation of the @xmath48 color with axis - ratio for the sample of galaxies with @xmath91  for comparison .",
    "we found statistically indistinguishable slopes in the @xmath48 versus @xmath72 relation .",
    "we plot the axis - ratio distribution as a function of stellar mass for the 33086  galaxies in our final sdss dr7 sample in figure [ rix ] . in that figure",
    ", we also plot the axis - ratio distributions in three broad mass bins .",
    "there are two obvious features in figure [ rix ] . at high stellar mass",
    ", there is a clear absence of elongated objects , implying the absence of high - mass , disk - dominated , passively - evolving galaxies at both @xmath92 and at @xmath1 , as was seen in vdw09 .",
    "second , below a threshold mass of @xmath6 , we find a much broader distribution of galaxy axis - ratios , implying a significant population of disk - dominated galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vdw10 ) .          we model the observed , projected axis - ratio distribution to infer the intrinsic axis - ratio distribution , assuming two types of toy models : triaxial systems and oblate spheroids .",
    "we use triaxial models because they are well motivated by other results which include galaxy kinematics ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the triaxial model of @xcite which has two components , a triaxiality , @xmath93 , and an ellipticity @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are the three different axis making up the triaxial system , with @xmath95 being the largest and @xmath97 being the smallest .",
    "we assume that both of these quantities are distribution as gaussian and so fit @xmath98 , @xmath99 , along with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "our second model is a subset of the triaxial model , namely the oblate spheroid model is defined by fewer parameters .",
    "we use the formalism of @xcite to describe the oblate spheroid component of the distribution .",
    "the free values are the minimum apparent axis ratio , @xmath96 , corresponding to thickness of the spheroid .",
    "once again , we assume a gaussian distribution around @xmath102 of size @xmath103 . the oblate spheroid model can be reproduced by a triaxial model with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we fit a number of models to the data simultaneously , ranging from one to three .",
    "if we fit more than one , we add additional fractions , @xmath106 which is simply the fraction of overall model distribution that is represented by a given component . to determine the best fitting model , we maximize the log likelihood assuming a poisson distribution .",
    "because the triaxial models are computationally intensive , we pre - compute the apparent axis - ratio distribution for a grid of values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 . to compare our data with models",
    ", we must then bin the data to same binning as our precomputed triaxial models , or bins of @xmath109 .",
    "for a given set of model parameters @xmath110 , we compute the relative probability for each bin in @xmath72 .",
    "we adjust the normalization such that the model has the same number of galaxies as the input sample , and can now compute the poisson log likelihood @xmath111 for each bin @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number of galaxies in that bin and @xmath114 is the number predicted by the model with parameters @xmath115 .",
    "we use a monte carlo markov chain to fit the distribution of axis - ratio values .",
    "we begin the fitting process with a single model , namely a triaxial distribution . in general , when fitting triaxial models to only the axis - ratio distribution , the triaxiality is not well constrained .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact the data are a single , projected value while our model contains two different axes . for galaxies with @xmath117",
    ", we find that a single component is not an adequate description of the data , with the model producing a deficit of galaxies at larger @xmath72 values and an overabundance of galaxies at small @xmath72 s . above that mass threshold",
    ", a single triaxial model appears to match the data well , however .",
    "the addition of a second , oblate spheroid model matches the data much more closely .",
    "we plot these model fits , along with the sdss data in blue , in figure [ rix ] . comparing the log likelihood values of the single model and two component model",
    "shows that the two component model is a better description of the data at a statistically significant level ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "finally , we add a third triaxial component . in general , whether we fit three independent triaxial components or an oblate disk with two independent triaxial components , the fitting process de - weights the third component .",
    "the resulting model is dominated by only two components , which make up @xmath11990% of the model . for the rest of the paper",
    ", we will use the two component model with one constrained to be an oblate spheroid for simplicity .      for the highest mass bin",
    ", we find a low oblate spheroid fraction , 13 @xmath120 4 % .",
    "the best fitting model has @xmath121 , near a triaxial model in the formalism of @xcite .",
    "this is close to the results found in that paper , and what we expected for large , dispersion supported systems .",
    "below @xmath122 , we can see the long , flat distribution to small axis - ratios well described by an oblate spheroid .",
    "in the middle mass bin , the fraction of oblate spheroids is  and it grows to  in the lowest mass bin . interestingly ,",
    "for the middle mass bin , the triaxial component has a very similar shape distribution as the triaxial component at higher masses .",
    "one of the more robust parameters for even the triaxial models are the minor to major axis - ratios . in figure",
    "[ ctoa ] , we plot the inferred distribution from the monte carlo markov chain of @xmath97 , or the minor to major axis - ratios .",
    "the two different components to our model are readily apparent , along with their relative weight .",
    "most striking , in even the high mass bin , there are no really round galaxies . the modal value for @xmath97 is inferred to be @xmath123 or a ratio of @xmath124 to 1 .",
    "such an apparently small minor axis - ratio is actually in good agreement with the data .",
    "the intermediate axis , assuming a @xmath125 or so , will be @xmath126 and so such systems will often appear to close to but not perfectly round , exactly as we see in figure [ rix ] .",
    "the second result is that , in all mass bins , there are no very thin galaxies . among the star - forming galaxy population ,",
    "disks can can thin @xmath127 , especially at lower masses and even in red pass - bands @xcite .",
    "our modal value for the lowest mass bin in figure [ ctoa ] is 0.25 and the median value for the whole of the distribution is 0.29 .",
    "thus , the low - mass , passively evolving population is @xmath9050% thicker than similar mass active star - forming galaxies which have values more like @xmath128 .",
    "the final @xmath129 samples contain 1332  galaxies in total ( 171  from gems ; 1161  from cosmos ) with masses greater than @xmath89 , though see sec .",

    "we use the parametric models we discuss in sec .  [ model ] to fit the distribution of data in fig .",
    "because of the much smaller sample size , we fit the data with both the same models as we did the sdss but also freeze some subsets of the parameters . in every case , we find that , within the limits of the uncertainties from the fits , the data can be described by the same model at both redshifts .",
    "the clear similarity between the axis - ratio distributions of our low- and high - redshift samples shows that a ceiling mass for quiescent , disk - dominated galaxies exists at least since @xmath132 , generalizing the low - redshift result from vdw09 .",
    "it is clear that , above @xmath133 , we find few flat galaxies .",
    "in contrast , these galaxies make up a much larger proportion of the population at masses below @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath15 , there is the same threshold for the population of `` disky '' early - type galaxies , that is found at @xmath134 .",
    "previous work has found a significant amount of evolution in the mass function of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "generally , the evolution appears at the lower mass end .",
    "as we have found that the axis - ratio distribution also changes with mass , with more disk - like early - types at lower masses , we will investigate if the mass function evolution is different for different sub - populations as selected by axis - ratio .",
    "we fit the mass distribution using a schechter function .",

    "this result , when combined with the observed evolution in the normalization of the mass function , and hints about the shape ( see [ roundmf ] ) , this triaxial population is built up over the redshift range we observe , but is done so in such a way to produce similar shaped systems over that time .",

    "this can be seen in two ways , first , we find more round galaxies , @xmath172 .",
    "second , we find more flattened systems , @xmath136 .",
    "this can be seen in both the minimum axis - ratio we find in figure [ rix ] , and , the distribution of @xmath173 values we infer from our parametric modeling in figure [ ctoa ] .",
    "quiescent galaxies with masses that dominate the cosmic stellar mass budget ( @xmath174 ) show a broad but non - evolving range in axis - ratios , at both @xmath15 and @xmath64 .",
    "the broad range in axis - ratios implies that the population can form through a number of channels . because we find so little evolution in the axis - ratios ,",
    "however , means that , whatever the mechanisms that form early - type galaxies in this mass range , they must have worked at similar rates across the last 7 - 8 gyrs of look - back time .",
    "this evolution can not explained entirely by the increase in the number of bulge - dominated galaxies ( say , merger products ) , nor can it be explained entirely by the cessation of star formation in disk - dominated galaxies without structural changes .",
    "several evolutionary processes that cause the formation of quiescent galaxies must contribute in order to explain the unchanging fractions of bulge- and disk - dominated quiescent galaxies .",
    "moreover , the relative importance of the various evolutionary processes has not strongly changed over the past 7 - 8 gyrs .",
    "this is reminiscent of the general result that the morphological mix of galaxies of these masses does not significantly change over the same time ( vdw07 , h09 , * ? ? ?",
    "our work finds consistent evolution in the number density of passively evolving galaxies with redshift .",

    "how can we explain the existence and continued growth of a population of quiescent , flattened galaxies ?",
    "gas stripping in group and cluster environments has long been argued to play a role @xcite , and was recently shown to explain the existence of the morphology - density relation @xcite . our tentative detection of an increased fraction of `` disky '' , quiescent low - mass galaxies ( @xmath175 ) at late times may indicate that this process is becoming increasingly important at late cosmic epochs .",
    "it is clear that _ all _ disk - dominated , quiescent galaxies can not be the result of gas stripping , especially those outside massive groups and clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while this may be feasible in the form of efficient gas stripping from satellite galaxies , even in sparser group environments @xcite , the observed differences between disky quiescent galaxies and star - forming spiral galaxies of the same mass imply that the former are not , generally , stripped versions of the latter .",
    "quiescent galaxies typically have fewer bars @xcite , larger bulges @xcite and are more concentrated @xcite than star - forming galaxies , though many of these properties are mass dependent @xcite .",
    "finally , the axis - ratio distributions of star - forming galaxies are markedly different , much flatter as expected for an oblate spheroid population alone , then the distributions we observe for early - type galaxies @xcite thus , at least at higher masses , the truncation of star formation must be intimately linked with bulge growth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , even if a sizable stellar disks remains intact .",
    "minor merging may provide a possible path , which would provide a natural explanation for our observation that the mix of bulge- and disk - dominated quiescent galaxies remains unchanged at @xmath176 .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism is that minor merging is common , it produces most of the growth for massive early - type galaxies ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "second , the amount of minor mergers grow bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though that depends on the gas content of the smaller system @xcite .",
    "because of this , @xcite suggests a two stage scenario .",
    "first , some feedback mechanism causes star - formation to cease .",
    "second , because lower gas content galaxies have more rapid bulge growth from minor mergers @xcite , the resulting remnants are both passively evolving and bulge - dominated .",
    "in fact , bulge growth through minor merging may cease star formation as a result of gas exhaustion , some feedback mechanism ( possibly agn ) , or the stabilization of a gaseous disk against star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main problem with such a process is , however , that we find no evolution in the overall axis - ratio distribution .",
    "this means this two stage process must produce as many bulge - dominated systems as new disk - dominated systems are added to the early - type galaxy population .",
    "if the rate of these two processes are not in good agreement , we would see a change in the distribution with time , the opposite of what our data show .",
    "this argues that the bulge growth and disk truncation should go hand in hand .",
    "if merging is the dominate physical process , this would imply some component of the merging    a dynamical process is required to turn the average star - forming galaxy into the typical early - type galaxy , for the reasons we list above .",
    "this process must generate a larger bulge fraction and population with an axis - ratio distribution that is markedly different from the flat population seen for star - forming systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most likely mechanism is merging , as merging changes the axis - ratio of galaxies with low gas masses .",
    "some combination of major merging and minor merging , with more emphasis on the later due to its larger frequency , is the most likely culprit for structurally transforming active star - forming galaxies into the passively evolving galaxies we observe both today and at @xmath132 .",
    "our study uses a simple measurement ( the projected axis - ratio ) to come to arrive at far - reaching conclusions about the evolution of galaxy structure .",
    "the caveat is that we rely on the assumption that flattened systems have significant rotational support .",
    "it also rests on the assumption that one number to characterize the intrinsic shape is a sensible approximation , allowing us to bypass bulge - disk decompositions @xcite and spatially resolved , stellar dynamics @xcite , which are notoriously difficult at high redshift .",
    "so far , such studies support our conclusions , most explicitly by the observation that the fraction of rotationally supported early - type galaxies is similar at @xmath0 and in the present - day universe @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether the absence of a significant population of very massive disk - like galaxies at @xmath176 is a fundamental feature of galaxy formation . perhaps under circumstances that are met at",
    "much earlier epochs than @xmath0 such galaxies can and do exist , and the observations presented in this paper merely show that merging , either minor or major , is the only relevant mechanism to produce very massive galaxies at relatively recent epochs .",
    "observations of significantly large samples of very massive galaxies at @xmath177 may provide answer and do show some hints @xcite .",
    "the structural properties of galaxies at the epoch during which the star formation rate was highest will tell us whether galaxies with stellar masses @xmath178 are always bulge dominated .      in this paper",
    "we analyze the projected axis - ratio distributions of early - type galaxies with stellar masses @xmath179 at @xmath64 and @xmath15 . by modeling the intrinsic distribution",

    "such galaxies are increasingly rare , both at the present day and at @xmath15 ( see figures [ rixtwo ] , [ dist ] and [ mf ] ) .",
    "this suggests that at all cosmic epochs the dominant evolutionary channel for early - type galaxies with higher masses is a dynamical process that transforms systems with a 1:3 intrinsic axis - ratio into a rounder , triaxial system with a roughly 2:3 axis - ratio .",
    "below that mass threshold , the early - type galaxy population becomes more and more dominated by flattened or disk - like systems , with roughly an axis - ratio of 1:3 .",
    "this is manifest in the number of round galaxies as well as in the larger and larger number of galaxies that appear thin in projection .",
    "this geometric picture also fits very well with the kinematic evidence that shows that most such early types are rapid rotators , at least in the present - day universe . once again",

    "the non - evolving shape of the mass function of flat versus round galaxies we find in figure [ mf ] coupled with the overall growth of the normalization implies that @xmath135 early - type galaxies form in a similar way over the last 7 gyrs .",
