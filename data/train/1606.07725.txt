    "outstanding questions related to this endeavor are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) how accurate do the astrometric and velocity / redshift measurements need to be to provide a tight constraint on the mbh spin by using the motion of a star , e.g. , s2/s0 - 2 , the closest one to the mbh currently detected @xcite ? ( 2 ) what is the parameter space for a possibly existing star within the orbit of s2/s0 - 2 that may help to put a strong constraint on the mbh spin and metric with the next - generation ( or future ) facilities ? constraining the metric and the spin of the gc mbh is of fundamental importance for testing general relativity ( gr ) , and a constraint on the spin direction would also provide insights into the assembly history of the mbh . in this paper",
    ", we address the above two questions and obtain guiding maps for future observational endeavors on constraining the gc mbh spin via extensive numerical simulations of the relativistic motion of a surrounding star in a large parameter space .",
    "we adopt the full gr numerical method developed in @xcite to investigate the spin - induced relativistic effects on the trajectory and the redshift of a star measured by a distant observer . as an alternative approach to those previous ones that utilize the perturbative ( post - newtonian or weak - field ) approximations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the full gr method is efficient and accurate in obtaining the orbital motion of a target star rotating around the gc mbh and the photon propagation from the star to the observer .    whether or not those spin - induced effects can be measured and a dynamical constraint on the gc mbh spin can be made depends on how precise the position and velocity measurements that current and future facilities , such as the gravity on the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , and the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , can achieve .",

    ", a star with @xmath216 and @xmath217 may be not so useful in constraining the gc mbh spin within a relatively short period ( e.g. , a decade ) , according to the left panel of figure  [ fig : f6 ] .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : f6 ] shows the quality of the spin constraints by using the motion of three full orbits of hypothetical stars with the same orbital orientation as that of s0 - 102 and assuming the position and the redshift precisions of @xmath218 .",
    "the input spin and its direction are @xmath219 .",
    "for such a spin direction , the spin - induced effects are moderate , though not maximum , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : f3 ] . as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : f6 ]",
    ", the spin can be constrained to an accuracy of @xmath220 by using the motion over a few orbits of a star with @xmath213 and @xmath214 even if the astrometric and the velocity precisions are only about @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore , for more than half of the possible spin directions , the mbh spin can still be constrained by monitoring the motion of a few orbits of such a star with the assumed position and redshift precisions of @xmath221 .",
    "the spin - induced effects also depend on the orbital orientation of a star rotating around the mbh , and this dependence is partly incorporated into the analytic approximations described by equations  ( [ eq : position ] ) and ( [ eq : redshift])-([eq : deltazv ] ) . by applying those analytical approximations to the motion over a few orbits of an assumed star with semimajor axis @xmath222 , eccentricity @xmath223 , but arbitrary orbital orientations , we find that the gc mbh spin can be well constrained for most of the possible spin directions if @xmath224 .",
    "the qualities of the constraints on the mbh mass ( @xmath30 ) and the gc distance ( @xmath48 ) may be defined as @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are the @xmath229 errors obtained from the mcmc fittings to the mock observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : f7 ] shows the qualities of the mbh mass constraint ( left panels ) and the gc distance constraint ( right panels ) , respectively , obtained from the mock observations for s0 - 2/s2 ( top panels ) and a hypothetical star ( bottom panels ) for a large range of the position and redshift accuracies .",
    "as shown in this figure , the accuracies of the mbh mass and the gc distance constraints can be up to a few @xmath230 and @xmath230 , respectively , by using the motion of s0 - 2/s2 over a few orbits if the astrometric and the velocity accuracy of future facilities can reach @xmath231 as expected . using a star with a significantly smaller semimajor axis compared to s0 - 2/s2 , e.g. , @xmath232 , the accuracies of the mbh mass and the gc distance constraints are poorer than those obtained by using s0 - 2/s2 with the same @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "the main reason is that the relative position error is higher for a star with a smaller semimajor axis given the same astrometric precision",
    ". even if the astrometric precision and the velocity precision are @xmath233 , much poorer than the optimistic expectations for the future facilities , the accuracies of the mbh mass and the gc distance constraints can still be up to one thousandth and a few @xmath230 , respectively , by using the motion of s0 - 2/s2 over three full orbits , although the mbh spin can not be well constrained for this case .",
    "in this paper , we adopt a full gr numerical method to investigate possible constraints on the gc mbh spin that may be obtained by future facilities via the relativistic motion of a star surrounding the mbh . in the mapping of the dependence of the spin - induced signals on any spin direction of the mbh for the given example stars , the maximum and the minimum strength of the spin - induced signals can differ by up to two orders of magnitude , and the strength of the spin - induced signals are at the same order of magnitude as the maximum strength if the spin direction is the same as the normal of the clockwise rotating young stellar disk located at the sub - parsec scale of the gc .",
    "the motion of the stars is helpful to test whether those two directions are the same or significantly different and further provide insights into the assembly history of the mbh .",
    "we use the mcmc fittings to demonstrate the quality of constraining the mbh spin , given any set of the astrometric and the redshift precisions of observational facilities .",
    "future facilities , such as the gravity on the vlti , the tmt , and the e - elt , are expected to realize position and redshift ( or velocity ) precisions at the level of @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "we find that in the ranges of astrometric precision and velocity precision with 130 @xmath0as and 0.110@xmath1 , an improvement in astrometric precision would be more effective at improving the quality of constraining the spin than an improvement in velocity precision , although the improvement in velocity precision can be effective at improving the quality of constraining the mbh mass and the gc distance .",
    "we obtain the parameter space of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity for the orbit of the target star that a high - precision constraint on the gc mbh spin can be obtained via the motion of the star .",
    "we demonstrate that the gc mbh spin can be constrained with high precision of 1-@xmath2 error @xmath236 or even @xmath237 by monitoring the motion of a star , if existing , with a semimajor axis of @xmath5 and an eccentricity of @xmath6 in a period of @xmath238yr with future facilities .",
    "with such a star and the optimistically expected position and redshift precisions , the quadrupole moment of the mbh can also be constrained and thus the ` no - hair ' theorem may be tested for optimistic cases in which the spin is pointing close to the direction with the most significant spin - induced effects ; a good constraint on the mbh spin can still be obtained as long as the spin direction is not close to that with the least significant spin - induced effects .",
    "note here that the questions we addressed in this paper are based on some significant simplifications ; therefore , they should be taken as the most optimistic results . in reality",
    ", there are a number of complications , such as , possible perturbation from background stars and tidal dissipation of the target stars .",
    "it has been shown that the tidal dissipation of the target stars is negligible for the parameter space studied in our paper @xcite . in the case",
    "in which the perturbation from background stars is not negligible and the orbit of the target star has some additional precession from the background stars , this precession may be modeled or removed since its evolutionary pattern is different from that of the spin - induced effects , which will be further studied in a separate work by using a hybrid relativistic model .    this work was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under nos.11273004,11373031,and11390372 , and the strategic priority research program `` the emergence of cosmological structures '' of the chinese academy of sciences , grant no . xdb09000000 ."
