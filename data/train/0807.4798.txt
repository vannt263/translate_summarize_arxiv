    "the applications of unitary chiral approaches ( u@xmath3pt ) in studies of low - lying baryons ( mesons ) have revealed many interesting aspects of these hadronic systems .",
    "one of these concerns the @xmath4 , which is found to correspond to two poles on the complex plane , one narrower around 1420 mev and one broader around 1390 mev  @xcite .",
    "this could have tremendous effects on our understanding of the kaon - nucleon interaction , and furthermore , on the idea of superstrong kaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the reason is quite simple because the 1420 mev pole is just 12 mev below the kaon - proton threshold while the position of the nominal @xmath4 is another 15 mev lower .",
    "the attraction for the nominal @xmath4 , therefore , is much stronger than for the former .",
    "the @xmath2 is not less interesting .",
    "studies based on unitary chiral approaches showed that the @xmath5 channel plays such an important role in the formation of this resonance that it qualifies as a bound state of the @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the coupling of the @xmath2 to the @xmath5 channel is almost two times larger than its couplings to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , although the branching ratios of the @xmath2 to these two latter channels are about @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , while the branching ratio to the former is only @xmath10  @xcite . to the various channels",
    "have been defined in a way that the @xmath11-wave couplings incorporate the @xmath12 factor and a normalization such that , up to phase space , the decay widths have the same expression in terms of the coupling constants . hence , a direct comparison of the @xmath13-wave and @xmath11-wave couplings is appropriate  @xcite . ]",
    "the u@xmath3pt description of the @xmath2 has recently been studied in various reactions , including @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18  @xcite , @xmath19 , @xmath20  @xcite , and the radiative decay of the @xmath2 to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 experiments at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) provide an excellent place for studying excited nucleons and baryons , due to the spin- and isospin - filtering of the @xmath23 decay process  @xcite .",
    "the bepc is now being upgraded to a two - ring collider ( bepcii ) with a design luminosity of @xmath25 @xmath26 s@xmath27 at 3.89 gev and will operate between 2 and 4.2 gev in the center of mass . with this luminosity , the new besiii detector will be able to collect , for example , 10 billion @xmath23 events in one year of running . this amount of @xmath23 events will make possible a complementary study of the properties of many excited nucleons and hyperons , which in the past were only accessible in @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) scatterings . in this sense , this work also aims to motivate the bes collaboration to perform a detailed study of the proposed reactions .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : in section ii , we briefly outline the unitary chiral description of the @xmath2 . in section iii , we study the @xmath30 and @xmath31 reactions within the unitary chiral approach , more specifically , we look at the ratio of the invariant mass distributions at the @xmath2 peak position . by studying this quantity , we not only can deepen our understanding of the nature of the @xmath2 and the underlying chiral dynamics , but also can avoid many uncertainties related to the unknown vertices and couplings in the production of the @xmath2 . results and discussions",

    "the inclusion of the @xmath33wave coupled channels is essential to put the @xmath2 at the right position with a proper width .",
    "the matrix containing the tree - level amplitudes is written as ( in the order of @xmath5 , @xmath32 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 )  @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the center - of - mass momentum of channel @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the energy of meson @xmath36 with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) the baryon ( meson ) mass of channel @xmath36 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath40 are provided by the lowest - order chiral lagrangian describing the interaction of the decuplet of the @xmath41 and the octet of the @xmath42  @xcite and have the following values @xmath43 in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath44 is used with @xmath45 mev , the pion decay constant . in the present work",
    ", we also use the same value .",
    "the @xmath32 coupling to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels through @xmath11 wave interactions have been neglected since the @xmath32 threshold is far from the @xmath2 and , therefore , plays a minor role in the description of this resonance .",
    "the @xmath46 s are not determined by chiral dynamics and their values ( together with the subtraction constants appearing in the loop calculations , see below ) are fitted to the experimental results on the @xmath6 and @xmath7 partial - wave amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "and @xmath67.[fig : uchpta ] ]     and @xmath68.[fig : diagram ] ]        the dynamical generation of the @xmath2 implies that the reactions proceed in the following way : the @xmath23 decays into @xmath69 ; the rescattering of the meson baryon , @xmath70 , pairs generates dynamically the @xmath2 , which then decays into either @xmath71 or @xmath72 . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath73 propagates and decays into @xmath74 .",
    "such a process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .    since we are only interested in the ratio of the corresponding invariant mass distributions of these two reaction around the @xmath2 peak position , the vertex of the @xmath23 decaying into @xmath75 is not relevant because it appears in both reactions and cancels in the ratio .",

    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio ] the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath0 and @xmath68 reactions , where the @xmath2 can be clearly seen .",
    "the ratio of the invariant mass distributions at the peak position is @xmath119 this translates into @xmath120    since the @xmath2 is a rather narrow resonance with a width of 15.6 mev , the above ratio can be compared with the branching ratio of the @xmath2 decaying into @xmath6 and @xmath121 . using the numbers given in the pdg  @xcite , @xmath122 for @xmath6 and @xmath10 for @xmath121 , we obtain @xmath123 and indeed it is quite close to our predicted number .",
    "however , it should be noted that the pdg branching ratio for the @xmath2 decaying into @xmath121 include various mechanisms , where the @xmath2 does not necessarily decay first into @xmath5 with subsequent @xmath100 decay into @xmath74 .",
    "in fact three experiments are quoted in the pdg claiming @xmath124 equal to either @xmath125  @xcite , @xmath126  @xcite , or @xmath127",
    "@xcite ,    in the formalism followed here we have created @xmath75 .",
    "however , we could as well produce @xmath128",
    ". in this latter case the @xmath114(1520 ) would decay into @xmath129 , a channel we are not concerned about , but also into @xmath130 and we would finish having the same final state @xmath131 as in the case of @xmath75 production . since these two reactions have the same final state , their amplitudes would sum . yet",
    ", it is easy to see that this new mechanism has a negligible effect on the calculated @xmath132 around the peak of the @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , @xmath133 from @xmath134 can be obtained from @xmath135 of the @xmath136 reaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdabar ] we show these two invariant mass distributions and we see that the one coming from @xmath134 below the peak of the @xmath2 is extremely small and can not change the results already obtained .",
    "the background below the peak of @xmath132 is of the order of @xmath137 .",
    "even if one had a coherent sum of the amplitudes , the effect of this background would still be moderate .",
    "however , since in @xmath132 for a given @xmath138 there are contributions of different pion momenta because of the four body phase space , and also there are contributions of different spins , the two mechanisms are highly incoherent and thus , the background from @xmath139 can be safely ignored in the analysis .     and @xmath140 reactions.[fig : lambdabar ] ]          in the chiral unitary picture ,",
    "all the @xmath121 events are generated through @xmath5 , which should be easily distinguishable experimentally . at the @xmath2 peak",
    ", one can not reconstruct the @xmath100 shape since there is no phase space for its production ; yet , as one can see in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sigmastar]a ) , there is a large concentration of strength at the upper threshold of @xmath141 close to the @xmath100 mass .",
    "note that the peak at lower @xmath74 invariant masses should be attributed to the wrong @xmath74 couples . by this",
    "we mean that if one looks at the @xmath142 invariant mass , one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] that one produces @xmath143 together with @xmath144 .",
    "resonant @xmath142 events come from the production of @xmath145 , but when producing @xmath143 , the @xmath142 state is not resonant and it is what we call the `` wrong couple '' . at higher @xmath121 invariant masses , however , the @xmath100 shape shows up very clearly .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sigmastar]b , c , d ) , we show the invariant mass distribution , @xmath146 , for other values of @xmath147 . in all these cases",
    "the @xmath100 peak in @xmath141 shows up clearly and stays at the same position independent of the @xmath121 mass . on the other hand , the `` background '' created by the wrong couple moves to higher @xmath74 invariant masses as the @xmath121 mass grows , hiding below the @xmath100 peak at @xmath148 gev , and moving to higher @xmath141 values above the @xmath100 peak as @xmath147 increases further ( not shown ) .",

    "the combined experimental study of these reactions and their mass distributions should definitely provide information to contrast the prediction of the chiral unitary approach as well as those of other models , hence helping understand better the nature of the @xmath2 .",
    "note that a similar pattern of the @xmath74 invariant masses as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmastar ] was observed in the @xmath152 reaction  @xcite .",
