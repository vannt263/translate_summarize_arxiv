    "quantum communication holds promise for the secret transfer of classical messages as well forming an essential element of quantum networks , allowing for teleportation of arbitrary quantum states and violations of bell s inequalities over long distances @xcite . while experimental and even commercial implementation of simple quantum communication protocols are well established @xcite , extending these techniques to distances much longer than the attenuation length of optical fiber remains a challenging goal due to exponential attenuation of transmitted signals . quantum repeaters @xcite overcome the exponential time overhead",
    "associated with fiber attenuation and other errors by using a quantum memory and local quantum computation .",
    "several promising avenues for quantum repeater implementation include both atomic ensembles @xcite and using few qubit quantum computers , such as neutral atoms in cavity qed  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite and solid - state single photon emitters  @xcite .",
    "experimental progress  @xcite towards realization of the dlcz protocol @xcite has been especially rapid , with many building blocks demonstrated in the laboratory .",
    "the experimental challenge is now shifting towards the realization of scalable quantum repeater systems which could yield a reasonable communication rate at continental distances ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , the dlcz protocol should be examined and adapted to practical experimental considerations , allowing to remove imperfections such as the finite efficiency of retrieval and single - photon detection and fiber length fluctuations .",
    "our approach extends the dlcz protocol , keeping the experimental simplicity of the original scheme while avoiding fundamental difficulties due to these expected experimental imperfections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we will review the dlcz protocol and describe our new approach which uses a new basis to encode each qubit .",
    "section iii compares both the dlcz protocol and our approach in the presences of imperfections .",
    "section iv estimates the time scaling of our approach and compares three specific implementations .",
    "section v summarizes our results .",
    "the dlcz protocol @xcite starts with entanglement generation ( eng ) by counting the interfering stokes photons scattered from a pair of distant atomic cells @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this generates an entangled state @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the creation operators of spin - wave modes in the two cells respectively , and @xmath7 the phase difference between left and right channels for stokes photons  @xcite .",
    "then , entanglement connection ( enc ) is performed on two pairs of entangled atomic cells @xmath8 and @xmath9 , obtaining a further separated entangled pair @xmath10 probabilistically .",
    "the enc step provides built - in purification against many imperfections ",
    "photon loss , atomic excitation loss and dark counts . in the final step , post - selection",
    "is used to obtain an effectively _ polarization entangled state _",
    "@xmath11 from two parallel pairs @xmath12 , which overcomes static phase errors ( time independent @xmath7 s ) .",
    "there are two important merits of the dlcz protocol .",
    "first , it has intrinsic purification of errors due to photon loss ( in the fiber , the quantum memory , and the photon detector ) and significantly relaxes the experimental requirement for quantum repeater .",
    "in addition , the time scaling of the dlcz protocol is always sub - exponential and very close to polynomial when the retrieval and detection efficiency is high .",
    "however , the dlcz protocol does not purify all kinds of errors .",
    "for example , time dependent @xmath7 s ( due to fiber length fluctuation ) induce phase error , which can not be taken out as a common factor in eq.([pme ] ) , since the two pairs of entangled atomic cells are not produced at the same time .",
    "such phase error is accumulated and doubled after each level of enc .",
    "in addition , combined photon loss during eng and enc may also induce phase error not purified by the dlcz protocol .",
    "furthermore , the dlcz protocol ( dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) still has a significant time overhead for long distances , because of the super - polynomial scaling in the presence of realistic imperfections .",
    "for instance , non - ideal retrieval and detection efficiency ( @xmath13 ) during enc introduces a large vacuum component , suppresses the success probability of later enc , and consequently slows down the protocol .    motivated by these issues , we will extend the dlcz protocol , mitigating the above errors .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure1.eps      we now consider a different approach in which two atomic cells are used at each node @xmath14 , labeled @xmath15 and @xmath16 , to store one qubit , @xmath14 .",
    "the qubit is defined as one single spin - wave excitation shared between two cells : @xmath17 when the stored spin waves are converted back into photons , the photons have a polarization ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) consistent with  that stored in the originating cell .",
    "this qubit basis allows projective measurements along any qubit states , e.g. , @xmath20 , using linear optical operations and photon counting @xcite . we will show that in this logical basis it is possible to perform entanglement purification ( enp ) @xcite to reduce errors within the logical subspace , including phase fluctuation .",
    "since enp can suppress errors within the logical subspace which occur with probability @xmath21 to @xmath22 , only a few enp levels are needed to obtain high fidelity entanglement .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure2.eps    we now describe our procedures for eng , enc and enp .",

    "1(a ) ) is similar to that of the dlcz protocol , but here _ two _ parallel entangled pairs are generated between @xmath14 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 the entangled states are prepared in the quantum memory , so no simultaneity is required for creating the two states comprising @xmath25 . for small excitation probability @xmath26 ,",

    "we now examine the performance of our new scheme by considering the role of errors , starting with how imperfections due to inefficiency limit the protocols .",
    "primarily , we find that inefficiency takes logical states into two types of non - logical states  those with too few excitations ( _ vacuum _ type ) and those with too many excitations ( _ multi - excitation _ type ) .",
    "we represent these errors by density matrix @xmath89 ( a mixed state with at most one excitation between both pairs of cells ) or @xmath90 ( a mixed state with at least one pair of cells with more than one excitation ) . the normalized density matrix after @xmath91th enc ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) can be written as@xmath92 where the @xmath91-dependent operator @xmath93 is the density matrix within logical subspace ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 also depend on @xmath91 ; and the coefficients @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the probabilities for the logical , vacuum and multi - excitation types , respectively .    after the first level of enc , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we can demonstrate that these three probabilities remain stable ( see appendix b ) for all higher levels of enc , by considering the un - normalized state after @xmath101th enc for the new approach : @xmath102 , with@xmath103 where the probability for the new logical error from the multi - excitation states ( accompanied by photon loss ) is@xmath104 the total logical error probability @xmath105 has two contributions : the accumulated logical errors from both input pairs for enc , @xmath106 , and the new logical error@xmath107 we can calculate for the new scheme,@xmath108    a more detailed calculation ( see appendix b ) , in which @xmath89 and @xmath90 are further divided into subspaces with different number of excitations ( e.g. @xmath89 is subdivided into zero - excitation and one - excitation subspaces ) , verifies the stability of the probability distribution of @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "( similarly , dark count can also induce errors in logical subspace with probability @xmath112 , which is however negligible due to very low dark count probability @xmath113 . )    for the dlcz protocol , only two cells are used to store entanglement . besides the logical states ( single excitation in two cells )",
    ", we can similarly define the vacuum states ( with no excitation ) and multi - excitation states ( with two or more excitations ) .",
    "contrary to our approach , the probability distribution is not stable  both vacuum and multi - excitation probabilities increases with distance ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the vacuum probability soon becomes the dominant term , which reduces the success probability of enc significantly , resulting in super - polynomial ( but still sub - exponential ) time scaling ( fig .",
    "the logical error probability for the dlcz protocol has the same form as eq.([logicalerror ] ) up to the coefficient , but the ratio @xmath114 ( thus @xmath106 ) grows with distance ( see appendix a ) , which accounts for the sharp decrease of fidelity for the dlcz protocol in fig .",
    "2(a ) . to maintain good final fidelity , the initial error @xmath115 ( and @xmath26 ) should be very small , which demands much longer generation time of an elementary pair for the dlcz protocol ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    in essence , by requiring at least one excitation in the ensemble , our qubit subspace is automatically purified of vacuum and multi - excitation type errors during enc .",
    "the closest analog to the dlcz protocol is our new scheme without enp , i.e. , only enc . at longer distances ,",
    "our approach is further improved in comparison to the dlcz protocol due to the reduced amplitude of vacuum terms .",
    "so far , we have only considered the effects of inefficiency that maps states between logical and non - logical subspace by changing the number of excitations .",
    "besides inefficiency , there are other imperfections , which preserve the number of excitations but induce errors within the logical subspace , such as interferometric pathlength fluctuation and linear optical misalignment . for example",
    ", the interferometric pathlength fluctuation leads to a phase difference @xmath116 , which changes @xmath117 into a mixture : @xmath118 where @xmath7 is static phase difference between left and right channels .",
    "since the last two terms with @xmath119 will be removed during the first level of enc , the static phase @xmath7 has no effect .",
    "however , the probability of being in an undesired logical state @xmath120 is @xmath121 .",
    "the first level of enc with the combined two inputs of @xmath122 and @xmath123 gives @xmath124 , producing a phase error with probability @xmath125 , proportional to the variance of the interferometric phase fluctuation .",
    "this error will be amplified during subsequent enc s , because the survival probability of the state @xmath126 ( the logical error ) is twice as much as that of @xmath127 ( the desired component ) .",
    "[ sec : diffusionmodel]we expect that there is little correlation in phase fluctuation between different sections of the fiber , and the variance of the phase fluctuation is proportional to the length of the fiber@xmath128 where @xmath129 is the phase diffusion coefficient of the fiber .",
    "if the phase fluctuation satisfies gaussian distribution , the phase error probability @xmath130 for example , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .    also , a small probability ( @xmath134 ) of linear optical misalignment per enc or enp step is modeled as depolarizing errors .",
    "later , we will demonstrate that errors within the logical subspace restrict the final fidelity of the dlcz protocol , while for our new approach additional active purification can correct such logical errors to achieve high fidelity .",
    "based on the calculation of the success probability at each level of connection / purification , we can obtain the estimated average time for various schemes . in fig .",
    "2 , we compare our approach to the dlcz protocol . for the dlcz protocol , the average creation time for a distant pair contains a super - polynomial contribution ( but still sub - exponentially ) with distance , due to instability of the vacuum component . for our new scheme ,",
    "the scaling is strictly polynomial with distance , @xmath135 , where the exponent @xmath136 explicitly depends on the efficiency .",
    "we remark that the dlcz protocol is slightly more efficient for short final distances ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the dlcz protocol can skip the entanglement connection and exploits post - selection to create the polarization entangled state , while the new scheme requires the first level of enc to eliminate those unwanted components and prepare the polarization entangled state .",
    "the post - selection has success probability @xmath37 , two times more efficient than the success probability @xmath138 for the first level of enc of the new scheme .    for the new scheme ( without enp )",
    ", we can use the stable probability distribution to estimate the average time : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the elementary pair generation time , @xmath141 is the elementary pair generation probability , @xmath142 is half the distance between neighboring repeater stations , and @xmath40 is the final distance .",
    "the exponent can be understood as an overhead from the finite success probability for enc , @xmath143 .",
    "the constant @xmath144 in eq.([empirical ] ) is the empirical estimate of the overhead from the waiting time to obtain two independent pairs versus the single pair . in fig .",
    "2 , the differences between the simulated data and eq.([empirical ] ) are attributed to the empirical factor ( @xmath144 ) and an overall factor from the overestimate of the success probability for the first level of enc . according to eq.([logicalerror2 ] )",
    ", one can always reach good final fidelity if the elementary pair generation probability @xmath26 scales as @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the average distant pair generation time scales _ exactly polynomially _ with distance @xmath135 , with @xmath146 .",

    "we may compare these schemes by using @xmath147 plots  a parametric plot of @xmath148 and @xmath149 as a function of excitation probability @xmath26 . for given noise model and efficiency @xmath150",
    ", a repeater scheme corresponds to a curve on @xmath147 plane .    in the absence of interferometric pathlength fluctuation ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the new approach without enp is about @xmath151 times faster than the dlcz protocol , for @xmath152 . as given by the previous discussion",
    ", this improvement is due to better control of inefficiency - induced imperfections .",

    "the higher the efficiency @xmath150 , the faster the quantum repeater . for high final fidelity ( @xmath153 ) ,",
    "the curves approach straight lines with slope @xmath154 , because @xmath155 .    when interferometric pathlength fluctuation ( leading to initial phase error ) is non - negligible , active enp is needed .",
    "we use a diffusion model for the pathlength fluctuation , as detailed in sec .",

    "@xmath147 curves are plotted , assuming the phase diffusion coefficient @xmath131 , corresponding to @xmath133 over @xmath132 . unlike fig .",
    "3 where only inefficiency is considered , there is an upper bound in final fidelity for each implementation .",
    "both the dlcz protocol and new approach ( without enp ) suffer from the initial phase error , with final fidelity no more than @xmath156 , while new approach with enp maintains high final fidelity up to @xmath157 . for high retrieval and detection efficiency ( @xmath158 ) , new approach ( with enp )",
    "can produce @xmath159 entangled pairs with fidelity @xmath160 at a rate of @xmath161 pairs / hour , even in the presence of substantial dynamical phase errors .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure4.eps",
    "in summary , our new approach to long distance quantum communication uses a different qubit basis which prevents the growth of vacuum and multi - excitation probabilities .",
    "this keeps the enc success probability high and error probability low , and leads to true polynomial scaling even in the presence of realistic inefficiencies .",
    "we can achieve a bandwidth of @xmath162 ( or @xmath161 ) entangled pair(s ) per six minutes for @xmath163 ( or @xmath164 ) and negligible initial phase error .",
    "the new approach also allows active entanglement purification , which combined with built - in purification of transmission loss errors allows purification of arbitrary errors in quantum communication .",
    "although the present approach shows a dramatic improvement in communication rates and robustness compared to original the dlcz protocol , the bandwidth remains relatively slow , even when very high efficiencies and very long - lived quantum memory are assumed . while such high efficiencies might ultimately be achievable ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent progress ) , other approaches need to be considered that can further improve the effective communication bandwidth .",
    "for example , we can use many cells per node to improve the bandwidth . in this case , the improvement is at least linear with the number of cells , making it possible to realize long distance ( @xmath159 ) entangled state generation bandwidth of the order of one pair per second .",
    "a simple monte carlo optimization of efficient use of the cells shows that we can increase the bandwidth by a factor of @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the increment of factor of physical resources .",
