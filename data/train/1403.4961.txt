    "specifically , we can approximate the integral directly by performing a reimann sum with bins of luminosity and redshift , with the values of @xmath147 and @xmath47 at any value of @xmath27 and @xmath4 available via simple interpolation of the distribution functions that are the direct output of the methods .",
    "it is simpler to use logarithmic bins of luminosity , in which case @xmath148 .",
    "if one is integrating over fsrqs of all luminosities the surface term @xmath149 is zero because @xmath150 and one is left with @xmath151 we note that at as @xmath4 approaches large values @xmath152 , and also that as @xmath27 approaches large values @xmath153 , so the contributions from high very high redshifts and very large luminosities is vanishing . integrating over all redshifts and luminosities , we find that @xmath154=7.6 ( + 4.0/-1.1 ) @xmath3810@xmath110 mev @xmath14 sec@xmath15 sr@xmath15 .",
    "the uncertainty results primarily from uncertainty in the value of @xmath49 , as well as uncertainty in the mean value of the photon index distribution for fsrqs .",
    "this value of this total @xmath154 can be compared with the total energy density of the egb , i.e. the total gamma - ray output of the universe in the range from 100 mev to 100 gev , which was determined by _ fermi _ in @xcite to be @xmath155=4.72 ( + 0.63/-0.29)@xmath3810@xmath118 mev @xmath14 sec@xmath15 sr@xmath15 , assuming a photon index for the background of @xmath3=2.4 .",
    "we see that fsrq blazars in toto contribute 16 ( + 10/-4)% of the total egb , emphasizing that the egb as defined here is the total gamma - ray output of the universe in the range from 100 mev to 100 gev .",
    "this is consistent with the result we obtained in bp1 where we estimated the contribution of _ all _ blazars ( both fsrqs and bl lacs ) to be between 39% and 100% of the egb if extrapolated to zero flux , and between 39% and 66% if extrapolated to a more reasonable lower limit flux of 10@xmath156 photons @xmath14 sec@xmath15 .",
    "the result here for fsrqs is also in agreement to within errors with the result of @xcite who find the contribution of all fsrqs to the total egb to be 21.7 ( + 2.5/-1.7)% . the larger uncertainty presented here results from the uncertainty discussed above , as well as considering the full uncertainty range in @xmath157 reported by @xcite .",
    "some authors have suggested that blazars could be the primary source of the egb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the results of bp1 did not rule this out , while the results presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite favor blazars being one of several important classes of sources .",
    "other possible source populations for the egb include starforming galaxies , which have been proposed as a possible significant contributor to the egb by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , although this is countered by @xcite , radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and non - blazar agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have used a rigorous method to calculate non - parametrically and directly from the data the redshift evolutions of the gamma - ray luminosity and photon index , as well as the density evolution , gamma - ray lf , and contribution to the egb of fsrq blazars .",
    "we use a data set consisting of the fsrqs in the _",
    "fermi_-lat first year extragalactic source catalog with @xmath5 and which lie at galactic latitude @xmath6 , with spectroscopically determined redshifts provided by @xcite .",
    "the method employed accounts robustly for the pronounced data truncation introduced by the selection biases inherent in the _ fermi_-lat observational catalog . the reliability of the methods employed has been demonstrated and discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and the appendix of bp1 .",
    "we note that since spectroscopic redshifts are available for virtually all of the fsrqs in the _",
    "fermi_-lat first year extragalactic source catalog , there is not a relevant limiting optical flux which must be considered , and the only relevant truncation in the data is that arising from gamma - ray flux and photon index .    in  3.3 of bp1",
    "we discuss the sources of error that may affect these determinations , including measurement uncertainties , blazar variability , and source confusion .",
    "as discussed there , in the determination of the contribution of fsrqs to the egb , these will be sub - dominant to the uncertainty resulting from the range of mean values of the photon index distribution that we consider , as well as the high redshift end of the density evolution function .",
    "subtler issues affecting the derived distributions may arise because of the finite bandwidth of the _ fermi_-lat and lack of complete knowledge of the objects spectra over a large energy range and deviations from simple power laws .",
    "this has the greatest potential to effect determinations of the photon index distribution , which we do not determine in this work but carry over from bp1 .",
    "however the bandwidth 100 mev to 100 gev is wide enough that the contribution of sources which peak outside of this range to the lf and evolution , density evolution , and the egb in this energy range will be small .",
    "we find that fsrqs have a strong luminosity evolution with redshift , well characterized ( at low redshifts ) by the evolution factor ( 1+@xmath4)@xmath158 with @xmath97=5.5@xmath1000.5 .",
    "this , along with positive evolutions in other wavebands such as optical and radio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , favors models in which at higher redshifts agn systems featured on average more massive black hole and accretion disk systems , and/or more rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "we find that fsrqs do not exhibit appreciable photon index evolution with redshift , indicating that the mean spectrum of accelerated high energy particles from agn central engines has remained constant over the history of the universe . given these evolutions , the density evolution , and the local lf and photon index distribution , we determine that the total energy density from fsrqs at all redshifts and luminosities is @xmath154=7.6 ( + 4.0/-1.1 ) @xmath3810@xmath110 mev @xmath14 sec@xmath15 sr@xmath15 , which is 16 ( + 10/-4)% of the total egb .",
    "this indicates that fsrq blazars are a significant , but not dominant , component of the egb .      in order to illustrate the general concept of an associated set applied to truncated data , in figure [ f10 ] we show the simplest case of two - dimensional luminosity - redshift data truncated by a universal flux limit for the survey .",
    "suppose one were performing a statistical test to determine correlation among the variables , with luminosity as the dependent variable and redshift as the independent variable .",
    "in order to form an unbiased set for comparison with object @xmath68 for this test , one should take only those objects that would be in the sample if they were at object @xmath68 s redshift . with the kendall tau test ,",
    "one ranks objects in the dependent variable against those with either a higher or lower value of the independent variable . in this case",
    ", the ranking would have to be against those with a lower value of redshift , in order for the associated sets themselves to be unbiased .",
    "the associated sets for an object will be more complicated if there are additional variables , and/or if the truncation limit is not universal .",
    "both are the case in this work , where both luminosity and photon index are important , and where the truncation is a function in the flux - index plane .",
