    "the pyrochlore antiferromagnet is strongly frustrated and the structure of its ground state represents a challenging problem in the field of magnetism .",
    "it has been argued that , for purely heisenberg interactions , both the classical and quantum versions of the model are magnetically disordered.@xcite it also appears that in the extreme quantum limit ( s=1/2 ) , lattice - symmetry breaking and spontaneous dimerization take place , although the ground state still exhibits macroscopic degeneracy.@xcite thus it is natural to expect that interactions beyond the heisenberg exchange , as well as inclusion of various magnetic anisotropies , can impose their own order , such as orbital , dimer , or magnetic , or combinations of these .",
    "effects due to orbital degeneracy , @xcite long - range dipolar interactions , @xcite and spin - lattice interactions @xcite have been studied .",
    "ising anisotropies can lead to the formation of  spin ice \" , @xcite which bears resemblance to the problem of proton disorder in ice.@xcite various planar @xcite and other anisotropic @xcite versions are also of strong theoretical interest , although they do not necessarily reflect the physics of the full 3d pyrochlore structure .",
    "finally , under certain conditions , even more exotic ground states have been proposed , such as u(1 ) spin liquids , @xcite or non - magnetic chiral states.@xcite    in this work we will discuss certain aspects of the mechanism for magnetic order formation due to the presence of dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interactions.@xcite for the case of classical spins , this mechanism was studied recently @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the quantum case ( s=1/2 )",
    "was discussed @xcite within a technical scheme , similar to the one used in ref .   for the pure heisenberg case .",
    "a puzzling difference between the classical and the extreme quantum case is that in the classical case non planar , chiral - like ( see below ) as well as coplanar spin order is possible,@xcite while in the quantum case only the chiral order was predicted.@xcite naturally , the way spin order emerges is also quite different in the classical and quantum cases , and for s=1/2 the induced antiferromagnetic order is  weak , \" in a sense that the ordered moment is proportional to the dm interaction itself .",
    "we point out that the role of dm interactions has been extensively studied only in the context of non - frustrated lattices , such as the square lattice , where it typically leads to weak ferromagnetic moments ( present , for example , in the copper oxide compounds . ) in frustrated lattices , however , the dm interaction effects can be much more profound , and are expected to lead to complex types of order.@xcite     slice of the pyrochlore lattice .",

    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "our goal is to investigate the possible types of magnetic order arising in this situation .",
    "it is technically very advantageous to consider the anisotropic limit , namely @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the heisenberg exchange between the layers ( thin black lines in fig .",

    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this strong - coupling approach is similar to the one used earlier,@xcite except that now we consider an anisotropic version of it .",
    "the quasi 2d version allows us also to monitor the low - energy excitation spectrum , and determine the conditions under which different types of dm - induced order can arise . in order to implement this program we need to know the exact excitation spectrum on a single tetrahedron , which we calculate below , and",
    "then consider the lattice version of coupled tetrahedra .",
    "the lattice shown on fig .  [ fig1](b ) is a frustrated one , and we will present arguments why the strong - coupling expansion , governed by the parameter @xmath4 , should work well in determining the ground state structure . in order to avoid cumbersome formulas we present below results for the strict limit @xmath5 , while we have checked that the types of order we find are pretty generic ( as long as the system is away from the strictly isotropic 3d case , which requires different considerations . )",
    "notice also that the lattice of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) is not the same as the 2d projection of the 3d pyrochlore , i.e. the checkerboard lattice,@xcite which has valence - bond solid order ( expected , quite generally , to compete with dm - induced magnetic order . )",

    "there is no reason to expect that the induced order in the two cases will be the same ; in fact two different types of order were found in the classical version.@xcite    in the rest of the paper , we first calculate the exact spectrum on a single tetrahedron ( section ii ) , which is then used to analyze the spectrum on the lattice and determine the possible types of order in section iii .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",

    "also , in this work we have not provided a dynamical mechanism for the layer decoupling , which we have taken as our starting point ( the presence of spin - phonon interactions with the correct symmetry can certainly accomplish this task . ) instead , our goal has been the study of time - reversal symmetry breaking in certain anisotropic model situations with strong frustration .    finally , the magnetic order sets in only below the ising transition temperature @xmath119 , as dictated by the pseudospin interactions . since @xmath30 is determined by the dm interaction ( fig",
