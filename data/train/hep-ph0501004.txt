    "one of the most interesting and persistent for a long time spin phenomena was observed in inclusive hyperon production in collisions of unpolarized hadron beams .",
    "a very significant polarization of @xmath0hyperons has been discovered almost three decades ago @xcite .",
    "there is a list of theoretical models which relate polarization mechanism with various aspects of hadron interaction dynamics @xcite but till now it has not obtained a satisfactory explanation .",
    "experimentally the process of @xmath0-production has been studied more extensively than other hyperon production processes .",
    "therefore we will emphasize on the particular riddle of @xmath0polarization because spin structure of this particle is most simple and is determined by strange quark only .",
    "we also provide comments on how this mechanism can be used for the explanation of single - spin asymmetries in the inclusive pion production .",
    "it should be noted that understanding of transverse single - spin asymmetries in dis ( in contrast to the hyperon polarization ) has observed significant progress during last years ; this progress is related to an account of final - state interactions from gluon exchange @xcite  coherent effect not suppressed in the bjorken limit .",
    "experimental situation with hyperon polarization is widely known and stable for a long time .",
    "polarization of @xmath0 produced in the unpolarized inclusive @xmath3interactions is negative and energy independent .",
    "it increases linearly with @xmath1 at large transverse momenta ( @xmath4 gev / c ) , and for such values of transverse momenta is almost @xmath2-independent @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "perturbative qcd with a straightforward collinear factorization scheme leads to small values of @xmath0polarization @xcite which are far below of the corresponding experimental data .",
    "modifications of this scheme and account for higher twists contributions allows to obtain higher magnitudes of polarization but do not change a decreasing dependence proportional to @xmath5 @xcite at large transverse momenta .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile this behavior with the flat experimental data dependence on the transverse momenta .",
    "inclusion of the internal transverse momentum of partons ( @xmath6effects ) into the so called polarizing fragmentation functions leads to similar decreasing polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition it should be noted that the perturbative qcd has also problems in the description of the unpolarized scattering , e.g. in inclusive cross - section for @xmath7-production , at the energies lower than the rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the essential point of the approaches mentioned above is that the vacuum at short distances is taken to be a perturbative one .",
    "there is an another possibility .",
    "it might happen that the hyperon polarization dynamics originates from the genuine nonperturbative sector of qcd ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the point of view that the polarization has its roots hidden in the nonperturbative sector of qcd is not an isolated one and several approaches based on nonperturbative dynamics has appeared up to now .",
    "we briefly mention them later .    in the nonperturbative sector of qcd the two important phenomena , confinement and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( @xmath8sb)@xcite should be reproduced .",
    "the relevant scales are characterized by the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "chiral @xmath11 symmetry is spontaneously broken at the distances in the range between these two scales .",
    "the @xmath8sb mechanism leads to generation of quark masses and appearance of quark condensates .",
    "it describes transition of current into constituent quarks .",
    "constituent quarks are the quasiparticles , i.e. they are a coherent superposition of bare quarks , their masses have a magnitude comparable to a hadron mass scale .",
    "therefore hadron is often represented as a loosely bounded system of the constituent quarks .",
    "these observations on the hadron structure lead to understanding of several regularities observed in hadron interactions at large distances .",
    "it is well known that such picture provides reasonable values for the static characteristics of hadrons , for instance , their magnetic moments .",
    "the other well known direct result is appearance of the goldstone bosons .",
    "the most recent approach to single ",
    "spin asymmetries ( ssa ) based on nonperturbative qcd has been developed in @xcite where , in particular , @xmath0-polarization has been related to the large magnitude of the transverse flavor dipole moment of the transversely polarized baryons in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "it is based on the parton picture in the impact parameter space and assumed specific helicity ",
    "flip generalized parton distribution .",
    "the instanton  induced mechanism of ssa generation was considered in @xcite and relates those asymmetries with a genuine nonperturbative qcd interaction . it should be noted that the physics of instantons ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) can provide microscopic explanation for the @xmath8sb mechanism .",
    "we discuss here mechanism for hyperon polarization based on chiral quark model @xcite and the filtering spin states related to unitarity in the @xmath12-channel .",
    "this mechanism connects polarization with asymmetry in the position ( impact parameter ) space .",
    "as it was already mentioned constituent quarks and goldstone bosons are the effective degrees of freedom in the chiral quark model .",
    "we consider a hadron consisting of the valence constituent quarks located in the central core which is embedded into a quark condensate .",
    "collective excitations of the condensate are the goldstone bosons and the constituent quarks interact via exchange of goldstone bosons ; this interaction is mainly due to a pion field which is of the flavor and spin  exchange nature .",
    "thus , quarks generate a strong field which binds them @xcite .    at the first stage of hadron interaction",
    "common effective self - consistent field is appeared .",
    "valence constituent quarks are scattered simultaneously ( due to strong coupling with goldstone bosons ) and in a quasi - independent way by this effective strong field .",
    "such ideas were already used in the model @xcite which has been applied to description of elastic scattering and hadron production @xcite .",
    "the initial state particles ( protons ) are unpolarized .",
    "it means that states with spin up and spin down have equal probabilities .",
    "the main idea of the proposed mechanism is the filtering of the two initial spin states of equal probability due to different strength of interactions .",
    "the particular mechanism of such filtering can be developed on the basis of chiral quark model , formulas for inclusive cross section ( with account for the unitarity ) @xcite and notion on the quasi - independent nature of valence quark scattering in the effective field .",
    "we will exploit the feature of chiral quark model that constituent quark @xmath13 with transverse spin in up - direction can fluctuate into goldstone boson and another constituent quark @xmath14 with opposite spin direction , i. e. perform a spin - flip transition @xcite : @xmath15 an absence of arrows means that the corresponding quark is unpolarized . to compensate quark spin flip @xmath16 an orbital angular momentum @xmath17 should be generated in final state of reaction ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "the presence of this orbital momentum @xmath18 in its turn means shift in the impact parameter value of the final quark @xmath14 ( which is transmitted to the shift in the impact parameter of @xmath0 ) @xmath19 due to different strengths of interaction at the different values of the impact parameter , the processes of transition to the spin up and down states will have different probabilities which leads eventually to polarization of @xmath0 .    in a particular case of @xmath0polarization the relevant transitions of constituent quark @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "1 ) will be correlated with the shifts @xmath21 in impact parameter @xmath22 of the final @xmath0-hyperon , i.e. : @xmath23 eqs .",
    "( [ spinflip ] ) clarify mechanism of the filtering of spin states : when shift in impact parameter is @xmath24 the interaction is stronger compared to the case when shift is @xmath25 , and the final @xmath26-quark ( and @xmath0-hyperon ) is polarized negatively .",
    "it is important to note here that the shift of @xmath27 ( the impact parameter of final hyperon ) is translated to the shift of the impact parameter of the initial particles according to the relation between impact parameters in the multiparticle production@xcite : @xmath28 the variable @xmath22 is conjugated to the transverse momentum of @xmath0 , but relations between functions depending on the impact parameters @xmath29 , which will be used further for the calculation of polarization , are nonlinear and therefore we will use semiclassical correspondence between small and large values of transverse momentum and impact parameter : @xmath30 @xmath31    we consider production of @xmath0 in the fragmentation region , i.e. at large @xmath1 and therefore use approximate relation @xmath32 which results from eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) for other particles ] .",
    "the mechanism of the polarization generation is quite natural and has an optical analogy with the passing of the unpolarized light through the glass of polaroid .",
    "the particular mechanism of filtering of spin states is related to the emission of goldstone bosons by constituent quarks .",
    "this picture is more physically apparent and justified than the polarization generation due to multiple scattering of constituent quarks in the effective field developed earlier by the authors in @xcite .",
    "we will now obtain an expression for the polarization which takes into account unitarity in the direct channel of reaction and apply chiral quark filtering to conclude on polarization dependence on the kinematical variables .",
    "we use the explicit formulas for inclusive cross  sections of the process @xmath33 where hadron @xmath34 is a hyperon whose transverse polarization is measured , obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this formalism is an account of unitarity in the direct channel of reaction .",
    "the corresponding formulas have the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the impact parameter of the initial particles . here",
    "the function @xmath37 is the generalized reaction matrix ( for unpolarized scattering ) which is determined by the basic dynamics of elastic scattering .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation @xmath38 is related @xcite then to the function @xmath37 by the relation : @xmath39 .",

    "arrows @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote transverse spin directions of the final hyperon @xmath34 .",
    "polarization @xmath47 can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath20 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "now we turn to the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 and will apply chiral quark model to get an information on the hyperon polarization and its dependence on energy , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "we have made replacement in ( [ poll ] ) according to relation ( [ bx ] ) : @xmath66    it is clear that polarization of @xmath0 - hyperon ( [ poll ] ) should be negative because @xmath67 .",

    "we would like to make a brief comment on this subject and to note that the reverse to the filtering mechanism can be used for the explanation of the ssa in pion production observed at fnal and recently at rhic in the fragmentation region . in the initial state of these reaction the proton is polarized and can be represented in the simple su(6 ) model as following : @xmath143    the relevant process for @xmath144production is @xmath145 which leads to a negative shift in the impact parameter and consequently to the positive asymmetry @xmath146 , while the corresponding process for the @xmath147production @xmath148 it leads to the positive shift in impact parameter and respectively to the negative asymmetry @xmath146 .",
    "asymmetry @xmath146 in the fragmentation region should have similar to polarization linear @xmath1dependence which is in agreement with the observed fnal and rhic experimental data @xcite at @xmath149 .",
    "as for the neutral @xmath7production the combination of @xmath20 and @xmath150quarks with up and down polarization makes contributions to cross  sections and asymmetry .",
    "on the basis of the simple su(6 ) model we can assume that the @xmath20quark with up polarization would contribute mainly in the fragmentation region .",
    "then the @xmath7production should have positive asymmetry .",
    "the corresponding behavior and experimental data obtained at fnal and rhic are depicted on fig .",
    "linear @xmath1-dependence agrees with the experimental data at large @xmath1 ( fragmentation region , @xmath149 ) .",
    "the expression for the unpolarized inclusive cross - section of the pion production in the fragmentation region can be obtained in a similar way to the corresponding cross - section of @xmath0 production .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ dsig ] ) leads to @xmath151 dependence at large @xmath2 and is valid also for the pion production .",
    "it is in agreement with @xmath152 ( with the exponent @xmath153 ) dependence of the inclusive cross - section of @xmath7-production observed in forward region at large @xmath2 at rhic @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath1 and choosing relevant function @xmath139 the @xmath154 dependence of experimental data can be reproduced .",
    "the proposed mechanism deals with effective degrees of freedom and takes into account collective aspects of qcd dynamics . together with unitarity , which is an essential ingredient of this approach",
    ", it allows to obtained results for polarization dependence on kinematical variables in agreement with the experimental behavior of @xmath0-hyperon polarization , i.e. linear dependence on @xmath155 and flat dependence on @xmath2 at large @xmath2 in the fragmentation region are reproduced .",
    "those dependencies together with the energy independent behavior of polarization at large transverse momenta are the straightforward consequences of this model .",
    "we discuss here particle production in the fragmentation region . in the central region",
    "where correlations between impact parameter of the initial and impact parameters of the final particles being weakened , the polarization can not be generated due to chiral quark filtering mechanism .",
    "moreover , it is clear that since antiquarks are produced through spin - zero goldstone bosons we should expect @xmath156 .",
    "the chiral quark filtering is also relatively suppressed when compared to direct elastic scattering of quarks in effective field and therefore should not play a role in the reaction @xmath157 in the fragmentation region , i.e. protons should be produced unpolarized .",
    "these features take place in the experimental data set .",
    "the application of this mechanism to description of polarization of other hyperons is more complicated problem , since they could have two or three strange quarks and spins of @xmath20 and @xmath150 quarks can also make contributions into their polarizations .    finally , it was shown that the mechanism reversed to chiral quark filtering can provide description of the ssa in @xmath7 production measured at fnal and recently at rhic in the fragmentation region and it leads to the energy independence of the asymmetry .",
