    "the process of charge transport in molecular junctions has received much attention recently.@xcite single molecule junctions , consisting of single molecules that are chemically bound to metal electrodes , are well - suited systems to study nonequilibrium transport phenomena at the nanoscale and are also of interest for potential applications in the field of molecular electronics .",
    "recent developments in experimental techniques , such as electromigration , mechanically controllable break junctions , or scanning tunneling microscopy,@xcite have made it possible to study transport properties of molecular junctions .",
    "the rich experimental observations , e.g. , coulomb blockade,@xcite kondo effect,@xcite negative differential resistance,@xcite switching and hysteresis,@xcite have stimulated many theoretical developments for understanding quantum transport at the molecular scale .    a particular challenge for the theory of charge transport in molecular junctions is the accurate treatment of correlation effects beyond the mean - field level . in molecular junctions , there are two types of correlation effects due to electronic - vibrational and electron - electron interaction . considering vibrational induced correlation effects , a variety of theoretical approaches have been developed , including scattering theory,@xcite nonequilibrium green s function approaches,@xcite and master equation methods.@xcite in spite of the physical insight offered by these methods , all of them involve significant approximations .",
    "for example , negf methods and master equation approaches are usually based on ( self - consistent ) perturbation theory and/or employ factorization schemes .",
    "scattering theory approaches to vibrationally coupled electron transport , on the other hand , neglect vibrational nonequilibrium effects and are limited to the treatment of a small number of vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "these shortcomings have motivated us to develop a systematic , numerically exact methodology to study quantum dynamics and quantum transport including many - body effects  the multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( ml - mctdh ) theory in second quantization representation ( sqr).@xcite for a generic model of vibrationally coupled electron transport , we have demonstrated the importance of treating electronic - vibrational coupling accurately .",
    "comparison with approximate methods such as negf reveals the necessity of employing accurate methods such as the ml - mctdh - sqr , in particular in the strong coupling regime .    in this paper , we extend the ml - mctdh - sqr method to treat electron - electron interaction . considering the paradigmatic anderson impurity model",

    "furthermore , we consider a model which incorporates both electron - electron and electronic - vibrational interaction . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the results reported for this model are the first obtained by a numerically exact method .",
    "it is noted that a variety of other powerful methods have been developed in the recent years with the same goal , i.e. , to facilitate numerically exact simulations for nonequilibrium transport in model systems .",
    "these include the numerical path integral approach,@xcite real - time quantum monte carlo simulations,@xcite the numerical renormalization group approach,@xcite , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group approach.@xcite , and the hierarchical equations of motion method @xcite . for a comparison and an comprehensive overview of various different methods in the case of nonequilibrium transport with electron - electron interaction see ref .  .",

    "section  [ conclusions ] concludes with a summary .",
    "to study correlated electron transport in molecular junctions , we consider a generic model which includes both electron - electron and electronic - vibrational interaction .",
    "the model comprises two discrete electronic states ( spin up and down ) at the molecular bridge , two electronic continua describing the left and the right metal leads , respectively , and a distribution of harmonic oscillators that models the vibrational modes of the molecular bridge .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    [ htot ] @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 describe the electronic degrees of freedom , the nuclear vibrations , and their coupling terms , respectively @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6    in the above expression @xmath7 denotes the number operator , subscript `` @xmath8 '' refers to the bridge state , `` @xmath9 '' the states of the left / right metal leads , and `` @xmath10 '' the two spin states . operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the fermionic creation / annihilation operators for the electronic states on the molecular bridge , the left and the right leads , respectively .",
    "the second term in ( [ h1tot ] ) describes the on - site coulomb repulsion of the electrons on the molecular bridge with electron - electron coupling strength @xmath14 .",
    "the energies of the electronic states in the leads , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , as well as the molecule - lead coupling parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 are assumed to be independent of the spin polarization and are defined through the energy - dependent level width functions @xmath19    without electronic - vibrational interaction the model introduced above reduces to the well known anderson impurity model,@xcite which has been investigated in great detail both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium.@xcite neglecting , on the other hand , electron - electron interaction , it corresponds to the standard model of vibrationally coupled electron transport in molecular junctions , which has also been studied in great detail , mostly based on approximate methods .",
    "recently a numerically exact treatment of the latter model ( i.e.  without electron - electron interaction ) became possible using path integral techniques,@xcite as well as the ml - mctdh approach.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , the full model including electron - electron and electronic - vibrational interaction has so far not been considered with numerically exact methods .    in principle , the parameters of the model can be obtained for a specific molecular junction employing first - principles electronic structure calculations.@xcite in this paper , which focuses on the methodology and general transport properties , however , we will use a generic parameterization . employing a tight - binding model , the function @xmath20 is given as    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are nearest - neighbor couplings between two lead sites and between the lead and the bridge state , respectively .",
    "i.e. , the width functions for the left and the right leads are obtained by shifting @xmath25 relative to the chemical potentials of the corresponding leads .",
    "we consider a simple model of two identical leads , in which the chemical potentials are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the source - drain bias voltage and @xmath28 the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "since only the difference @xmath29 is physically relevant , we set @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the frequencies @xmath31 and electronic - nuclear coupling constants @xmath32 of the vibrational modes of the molecular junctions are modeled by a spectral density function@xcite @xmath33 in this paper , the spectral density is chosen in ohmic form with an exponential cutoff @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dimensionless kondo parameter",

    "various initial states can be considered .",
    "for example , one may choose an initially unoccupied bridge state and the nuclear degrees of freedom equilibrated with this state , i.e.  an unshifted bath of oscillators with @xmath57 as given in eq .",
    "( [ hnuc ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", one may also start with a fully occupied bridge state and a bath of oscillators in equilibrium with the occupied bridge state @xmath58.\\ ] ] other initial states may also be prepared .",
    "the initial state may affect the transient dynamics profoundly .",
    "the dependence of the steady - state current on the initial density matrix is a more complex issue .",
    "recent investigations for a model without electron - electron interaction seem to indicate that different initial states may lead to different ( quasi)steady states,@xcite although this has been debated.@xcite even without coupling to a vibrational bath , the initial bridge state population may still affect the final stationary current in a time - dependent simulation.@xcite for all results reported in this paper , our calculations show that the stationary state is independent on the initial condition within the error bar of the simulation ( which is estimated to be less than 10% relative error ) .",
    "since different sets of initial conditions also affect the time scale at which the current @xmath59 reaches its stationary value , we typically choose initial conditions that are close to the final steady state , e.g. , an unoccupied initial bridge state if its energy is higher than the fermi level of the leads and an occupied bridge state otherwise .    the transient behavior of the thus defined currents @xmath60 and @xmath61 is usually different .",
    "however , the long - time limits of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which define the stationary current , are the same .",
    "it is found that the average current @xmath62,\\ ] ] provides better numerical convergence properties by minimizing the transient characteristic , and thus will be used in most calculations .    in our simulations",
    "the continuous set of electronic states of the leads is represented by a finite number of states .",
    "the number of states required to properly describe the continuum limit depends on the time @xmath63 .",
    "the situation is thus similar to that of a quantum reactive scattering calculation in the presence of a scattering continuum , where , with a finite number of basis functions , an appropriate absorbing boundary condition is added to mimic the correct outgoing green s function.@xcite employing the same strategy for the present problem , the regularized electric current is given by @xmath64    the regularization parameter @xmath65 is similar ( though not identical ) to the formal convergence parameter in the definition of the green s function in terms of the time evolution operator @xmath66 in numerical calculations , @xmath65 is chosen in a similar way as the absorbing potential used in quantum scattering calculations.@xcite in particular , the parameter @xmath65 has to be large enough to accelerate the convergence but still sufficiently small in order not to affect the correct result .",
    "while in the reactive scattering calculation @xmath65 is often chosen to be coordinate dependent , in our simulation @xmath65 is chosen to be time dependent @xmath67 here @xmath68 is a damping constant , @xmath69 is a cutoff time beyond which a steady state charge flow is approximately reached . as the number of electronic states increases",
    ", one may choose a weaker damping strength @xmath68 and/or longer cutoff time @xmath69 .",
    "the former approaches zero and the latter approaches infinity for an infinite number of states . in practice , for the systems considered in this work , convergence can be reached with a reasonable number of electronic states in the range of 80 - 500 , with a typical @xmath70 30 - 80 fs ( a smaller @xmath69 for less number of states ) and @xmath71 3 - 10 fs .    to gain insight into the transport mechanisms , it is also useful to consider the population of the electronic states localized on the the molecular bridge , which is given by @xmath72 } { \\rm tr }          \\left\\ { \\hat{\\rho } e^{i\\hat{h}t } \\sum_{\\sigma}\\ ; \\hat{n}_{d,\\sigma}\\ ; e^{-i\\hat{h}t }          \\right\\}.\\ ] ]",
    "the time - dependent study of transport properties in the model introduced above requires a method that is able to describe many - body quantum dynamics in an accurate and efficient way . for this purpose",
    "we employ the recently proposed multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree theory in second quantization representation ( ml - mctdh - sqr),@xcite which allows a numerically exact treatment of the many - body problem . here",
    "we give a brief outline of the method .",
    "the ml - mctdh theory@xcite is a rigorous variational method to propagate wave packets in complex systems with many degrees of freedom . in this approach",
    "the wave function is represented by a recursive , layered expansion ,    [ psiml ] @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and so on are the expansion coefficients for the first , second , third , ... , layers , respectively ; @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , ... , are the `` single particle '' functions ( spfs ) for the first , second , third , ... , layers . in eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , @xmath83 denotes the number of single particle ( sp ) groups / subspaces for the first layer .",
    "similarly , @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) is the number of sp groups for the second layer that belongs to the @xmath85th sp group in the first layer , i.e. , there are a total of @xmath86 second layer sp groups .",
    "continuing along the multilayer hierarchy , @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) is the number of sp groups for the third layer that belongs to the @xmath88th sp group of the second layer and the @xmath85th sp group of the first layer , resulting in a total of @xmath89 third layer sp groups .",
    "naturally , the size of the system that the ml - mctdh theory can treat increases with the number of layers in the expansion . in principle , such a recursive expansion can be carried out to an arbitrary number of layers .",
    "the multilayer hierarchy is terminated at a particular level by expanding the spfs in the deepest layer in terms of time - independent configurations , each of which may contain several cartesian degrees of freedom .",
    "the variational parameters within the ml - mctdh theoretical framework are dynamically optimized through the use of the dirac - frenkel variational principle@xcite @xmath90 which results in a set of coupled , nonlinear differential equations for the expansion coefficients for all layers.@xcite for a @xmath91-layer version of the ml - mctdh theory there are @xmath92 levels of expansion coefficients . in this sense",
    "the conventional wave packet propagation method is a `` zero - layer '' mctdh approach .",
    "the introduction of this recursive , dynamically optimized layering scheme in the ml - mctdh wavefunction provides more flexibility in the variational functional , which results in a tremendous gain in our ability to study large many - body quantum systems . during the past few years",
    ", significant progress has been made in further development of the theory to simulate quantum dynamics and nonlinear spectroscopy of ultrafast electron transfer reactions in condensed phases.@xcite the theory has also been generalized to study heat transport in molecular junctions@xcite and to calculate rate constants for model proton transfer reactions in molecules in solution.@xcite recent work of manthe has introduced an even more adaptive formulation based on a layered correlation discrete variable representation ( cdvr).@xcite      to extend the original ml - mctdh approach to systems of identical quantum particles requires a method that incorporates the exchange symmetry explicitly .",
    "this is because an ordinary hartree product within the first quantized picture is only suitable to describe a configuration for a system of distinguishable particles .",
    "one strategy is to employ a properly symmetrized wave function in the first quantized framework , i.e. , permanents in a bosonic case or slater determinants in a fermionic case .",
    "this led to the mctdhf approach@xcite for treating identical fermions and the mctdhb approach@xcite for treating identical bosons as well as combinations thereof.@xcite however , this wave function - based symmetrization is only applicable to the single layer mctdh theory but is incompatible with the ml - mctdh theory with more layers  there is no obvious analog of a multilayer hartree configuration if permanents / determinants are used to represent the wave function . as a result , the ability to treat much larger quantum systems numerically exactly was severely limited .    to overcome this limitation we proposed a novel approach@xcite that follows a fundamentally different route to tackle many - body quantum dynamics of indistinguishable particles  an operator - based method that employs the second quantization formalism of many - particle quantum theory .",
    "this differs from many previous methods where the second quantization formalism is only used as a convenient tool to derive intermediate expressions for the first quantized form . in the new approach the variation",
    "is carried out entirely in the abstract fock space using the occupation number representation .",
    "therefore , the burden of handling symmetries of identical particles in a numerical variational calculation is shifted completely from wave functions to the algebraic properties of operators .",
    "the major difference between the ml - mctdh - sqr theory for identical fermions and the previous ml - mctdh theory for distinguishable particles is the way how operators act .",
    "for example , in the second quantized form the fermionic creation / annihilation operators fulfill the anti - commutation relations @xmath93 the symmetry of identical particles is thus realized by enforcing such algebraic properties of the operators .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing a permutation sign operator associated with each fermionic creation / annihilation operator , which incorporates the sign changes of the remaining spin orbitals in all the spfs whose subspaces are prior to it.@xcite for example , if a purely electronic problem is considered and only one layer is present , the overall wave function and the spfs have the form    @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 are the occupation numbers .",
    "a fermionic creation operator is actually implemented as @xmath97 where @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is the permutation sign operator that accounts for permuting @xmath100 from the first subspace all the way through to the @xmath85th subspace , and @xmath101 is the reduced creation operator that only takes care of the fermionic anti - commutation relation in the @xmath85th subspace . the operator - based anti - commutation constraint ( [ anticomm ] ) results in the following operations    [ permutesign ] @xmath102\\ ;   b_{n_1n_2",
    "... n_{m_\\kappa}}^{\\kappa , j_\\kappa}(t)\\ ;      |n_1\\rangle |n_2\\rangle ... |1_\\nu\\rangle ... |n_{m_\\kappa } \\rangle,\\ ] ] @xmath103\\ ;   b_{n_1n_2 ... n_{m_\\mu}}^{\\mu , j_\\mu}(t)\\ ;      |n_1\\rangle |n_2\\rangle ... |n_{m_\\mu } \\rangle.\\ ] ]    i.e. , @xmath101 not only creates a particle in the @xmath104th spin orbital if it is vacant , but also affects the sign of each term in this spf according to where @xmath104 is located and what the occupations are prior to it .",
    "furthermore , the permutation sign operators @xmath98 , @xmath99 , incorporate the sign changes of the remaining spin orbitals in all the spfs whose subspaces are prior to that of @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the occupation number states in the ml - mctdh - sqr theory are treated in the same way as the degrees of freedom in the original ml - mctdh theory , except that the orderings of all the sp groups in all layers need to be recorded and maintained in later manipulations .",
    "more importantly , the equations of motion have the same form as in the original ml - mctdh theory .",
    "the only difference is that for identical fermions each creation / annihilation operator of the hamiltonian is effectively a product of operators : a reduced creation / annihilation operator that only acts on the bottom - layer spfs for the fock subspace it belongs to , and a series of permutation sign operators that accounts for the fermionic anti - commutation relations of all the spin orbitals prior to it . in the multilayer case",
    "the implementation is sophisticated but can still be reduced to handling ( many and complicated ) basic building blocks in the mctdh or ml - mctdh theory  products of operators .",
    "thereby , the action of each hamiltonian term ( product of creation / annihilation operators ) can be split into a series of operations on individual fock subspaces.@xcite on the other hand , for identical bosons the implementation is much simpler because there is no sign change upon permutation .    in the second quantized form",
    ", the wave function is represented in the abstract fock space employing the occupation number basis . as a result , it can be expanded in the same multilayer form as that for systems of distinguishable particles .",
    "it is thus possible to extend the numerically exact treatment to much larger systems .",
    "the symmetry of the wave function in the first quantized form is shifted to the operator algebra in the second quantized form .",
    "the key point is that , for both phenomenological models and more fundamental theories , there are only a limited number of combination of fundamental operators .",
    "for example , in electronic structure theory only one- and two - electron operators are present .",
    "this means that one never needs to handle all , redundant possibilities of operator combinations as offered by the determinant form in the first quantized framework .",
    "it is exactly this property that provides the flexibility of representing the wave functions in multilayer form and treat them accurately and efficiently within the ml - mctdh - sqr theory .",
    "it is also noted that the ml - mctdh - sqr approach outlined above for fermions has also be formulated for bosons or combinations of fermions , bosons and distinguishable particles.@xcite",
    "in this section , we present applications of the ml - mctdh - sqr methodology to the study of correlated electron transport employing the model described in sec .",
    "[ modeltight ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss the influence of electron - electron and electronic - vibrational interaction on the transport characteristics for selected examples .",
    "unlike the noninteracting transport model ( @xmath106 ) , these results represent nontrivial solutions to a many - body quantum problem and are often beyond the perturbation treatment .",
    "all calculations presented in this paper are for zero temperature , which corresponds to the deep quantum regime , and is often the most challenging physical regime of the problem . meanwhile",
    ", this regime is relatively easy for our approach since only one initial wave function is required .",
    "an investigation of systems at finite temperature as well as an analysis of the physical mechanisms in a broader parameter range will be the topic of future work .",
    "we first focus on the influence of electron - electron interaction and consider models without electronic - vibrational coupling ( @xmath107 ) , i.e.  for fixed nuclei . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the time - dependent current and the corresponding bridge state population for a model with the following set of electronic parameters : the tight - binding parameters for the function @xmath20 are @xmath108 ev , @xmath109 ev , corresponding to a moderate molecule - lead coupling and a bandwidth of 4 ev .",
    "the energy of the bridge states @xmath110 is located 0.5 ev above fermi energy and the source - drain voltage is @xmath111 v , i.e.  the model is in the off - resonant transport regime .",
    "the results for both the current and the population show pronounced transient oscillations that decay on a time scale of @xmath112 and approach a stationary plateau at longer times , which represents the steady state .",
    "the overall values of the current and population are rather small because the transport takes place in the off - resonant regime .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for different parameters @xmath14 shows that for this model electron - electron interaction has no significant influence on the population and the current , and this includes both the transient behavior and the long - time stationary value .",
    "qualitatively this can be understood from the fact that the model is in the off - resonant transport regime . at zero coupling strength @xmath14 ,",
    "the bare energies of the electronic bridge states are the same and are outside the conductance window defined by the chemical potentials of the two electrodes .",
    "including the on - site repulsion term removes the degeneracy of these two bridge states if one state is occupied .",
    "that is , when one of the bridge states is populated , the electronic energy of the other state is increased by the value of @xmath14 .",
    "however , due to the fact that the initial bridge states are relatively far away from the conductance window , their populations are small . as a result ,",
    "the overall electronic correlation effect is small for this set of model parameters . at a finer scale",
    "it can be seen that with the increase in @xmath14 both the stationary current and bridge state population decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that upon increasing @xmath14 the energy of the doubly occupied state ( @xmath113 ) is moved to higher energies and thus even further away from the conduction window .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the time - dependent current and the corresponding bridge state population for another model , where the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] except for @xmath114 , i.e. , energy of the bridge states is located at the fermi energy of the leads . for zero on - site coupling strength ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "this set of parameters corresponds to the resonant tunneling regime and involves mixed electron / hole transport .",
    "this results in a significantly larger stationary current and a population of approximately one , because each bridge state has  50% probability to be occupied . in this parameter regime",
    ", electron - electron interaction has a pronounced influence on the transport characteristics .",
    "upon increase of @xmath14 the steady state value of both the current and the population decreases significantly .",
    "this is due to the fact that for increasing @xmath14 the energy of the doubly occupied state moves out of the conductance window . for interaction strengths @xmath116ev",
    ", the bridge state can only be singly occupied , resulting in an overall population of @xmath117 , and the doubly occupied state does not contribute to the current .",
    "we next consider in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] a model with the same parameters as in the previous two cases except that the energy of the bridge state is below the fermi energy , @xmath118 ev . for vanishing electron - electron interaction ,",
    "@xmath115 , this is again a non - resonant case .",
    "however , because the bridge state is , in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , located below the fermi energy it is almost doubly occupied when @xmath115 . while the stationary current for @xmath115 ( full black line in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) is , due to particle - hole symmetry , in fact identical to that in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the dependence of the transport characteristics on the electron - electron interaction is more complex than in the above two cases . upon moderate increase of @xmath14 , the energy of the doubly occupied state , @xmath113 , moves closer to the fermi energy and enters the conductance window . as a result ,",
    "the population of this state decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the current ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) , on the other hand , increases because the doubly occupied state provides a channel for resonant transport .",
    "it is also observed that upon moderate increase of @xmath14 the transient dynamics undergoes a coherent to incoherent transition .",
    "when @xmath14 is further increased ( @xmath119 ev ) , the energy of the doubly occupied state becomes higher than the chemical potentials of both electrodes .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this causes a decrease of the current and the population .",
    "for large values of @xmath14 , the population in the steady state approaches a value of unity , because the bridge state can only be singly occupied .",
    "it is interesting to note that for large coulomb repulsion , e.g.   @xmath120ev , the initial transient current is negative .",
    "this is because in the simulation the bridge state is initially fully occupied . during the early transient time , electrons flow from the bridge states to both the left and the right electrodes , resulting in a negative transient current .",
    "as the bridge states approach their steady state population , electrons move continuously from the left electrode to the right electrode , establishing a steady - state current .      an interesting many - body nonequilibrium effect in charge transport in mesoscopic and nanosystems",
    "is coulomb blockade.@xcite this phenomenon involves the suppression of the electrical current due to electron - electron interaction . within the single - site anderson impurity model",
    ", the underlying mechanism is that the coulomb repulsion with an electron that already occupies the bridge state prevents a second electron to transfer onto the bridge and thus reduces the current compared to a noninteracting model .",
    "this basic aspect of coulomb blockade is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which shows simulated current - voltage characteristics for a resonant transport model , where the energy of the bridge states @xmath110 is at the fermi energy of the leads , @xmath114 .",
    "the tight - binding parameters for the function @xmath20 are @xmath121 ev , @xmath109 ev , corresponding to a smaller molecule - lead coupling and a bandwidth of 4 ev . besides the noninteracting model ( @xmath115 ) , three values of the electron - electron coupling strengths are considered : @xmath122 1 , and 4 ev . to obtain the current - voltage characteristics , the stationary plateau value from the time - dependent simulation of the current",
    "was taken for each given voltage .",
    "the results show that upon inclusion of electron - electron interaction , the currents are suppressed at all voltages .",
    "the ratio between the blocked and unblocked currents attain a stationary ratio of approximately 2/3 in the plateau region ( within the convergence range of less than 10% relative error ) , and is nearly independent of the electronic coupling strength @xmath14 . within a zeroth order picture , this result can be rationalized as follows .    for the model without electron - electron interaction ( @xmath115 )",
    ", there are three channels for electron transport through the two bridge states : ( i ) electron transport through an initially unoccupied state .",

    "( ii ) electron transport through an initially singly occupied bridge resulting in the third channel which involves double occupation of the bridge state . when the source - drain voltage @xmath27 is small , roughly @xmath123 in the zeroth - order picture , the third two - electron transport channel is essentially closed , resulting in a current value 2/3 of that for the unblocked case . at approximately @xmath124 , e.g. , @xmath125 v for the case @xmath126 ev in fig .",

    "the transition is broadened as shown in fig .",

    "the energy of the doubly occupied state is outside the conductance window of the bias voltages considered and thus the current is suppressed .    while fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] demonstrates the phenomenon of coulomb blockade for varying the source - drain voltage , it is also instructive to study the phenomenon for varying the gate voltage . assuming that an additional gate voltage @xmath127 predominantly shifts the energy of the bridge states @xmath110",
    ", we can investigate the influence of the gate voltage by varying @xmath110 relative to the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "the result depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] exhibits the well known peak structures of coulomb blockade , with maxima at energies @xmath128 and @xmath129 , where the singly occupied levels and the doubly occupied level are in the conductance window , respectively .",
    "the parameters here are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] except for a fixed @xmath126ev and a source - drain voltage @xmath130v .",
    "it is noted that the value of the voltage considered is already beyond the linear response regime .",
    "we finally consider a model which includes both electron - electron and electron - vibrational interaction .",
    "the presence of both interactions increases the complexity significantly . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the results presented here are the first numerical exact simulations for this type of models .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows results for a model , where the electronic parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , i.e. , @xmath108 ev , @xmath109 ev , @xmath131 , and a source - drain voltage of @xmath111 v. the electronic degrees of freedom are coupled to a vibrational bath modeled by an ohmic spectral density , as described sec .",
    "[ modeltight ] .",
    "the characteristic frequency and the reorganization energy of the vibrational bath are @xmath132  @xmath133 and @xmath134ev , respectively .",
    "these values are typical for larger molecular systems . without coulomb repulsion and coupling to the vibrational bath",
    ", this model corresponds to the resonant transport regime . including the couplings to the vibrational modes has a significant impact on the electrical current . after a short transient time the coupling to the vibrations becomes effective and results in a suppression of the current .",
    "as illustrated by the solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the effect is very pronounced and the stationary current is essentially blocked .",
    "the underlying mechanism can be qualitatively rationalized by considering the energy level of the bridge states . for any finite bias voltage",
    ", the bare energy of the bridge states ( @xmath135 ) is located between the chemical potential of the leads and thus , within a purely electronic model , current can flow .",
    "the coupling to the vibrations results in a polaron shift of the energy of the bridge state given by the reorganization energy @xmath136 . for electronic - vibrational coupling strengths with @xmath137",
    "the polaron - shifted energy of the bridge state is below the chemical potentials of both leads and thus current is blocked .",
    "this effect , referred to as phonon blockade of the current , has been observed e.g. in quantum dots@xcite and has been analyzed previously.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , the bridge states are almost fully occupied in this case .    when the coulomb repulsion term is included in the simulation ( in addition to the vibrational bath ) , the energy level of the doubly occupied bridge state is shifted to higher energies as discussed for the previous models . for smaller values of @xmath14",
    ", this brings the polaron - shifted bridge state back to the conduction window and thus increases the stationary current .",
    "this can be seen from the currents for @xmath126ev and @xmath138ev in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , which shows the current - voltage characteristics for a few selected values of @xmath14 .",
    "it is evident that for small @xmath14 the stationary current increases versus @xmath14 .",
    "however , if @xmath14 becomes too large , e.g. , @xmath120ev in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , the doubly occupied bridge state has too high energy and is located above the conduction window , which again results in a suppression of the stationary current . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall population of the bridge state decreases monotonically upon increase of @xmath14 and reaches a value of unity for large @xmath14 because then the bridge state can only be singly occupied . due to the strongly correlated dynamics in this parameter regime , including both electron - electron and electronic - vibrational coupling , convergence for larger values of @xmath14 and larger voltages than those depicted in figs ,  [ fig7 ] ,  [ fig8 ] is difficult within our present implementation of the ml - mctdh - sqr methodology .",
    "experience shows that convergence in this regime can be facilitated by transforming the current hamiltonian to another form in order to reduce correlation effects",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "although the interpretation of the above vibronic and electronic correlated transport properties is appealing in terms of the energetics of the bridge states , it should be emphasized that the mechanism involves the formation of correlated many - body states that are significantly more complex than this noninteracting electronic picture , and can not be fully described by just considering the static shift of the energy of the bridge states .",
    "this is evident by examining the strength of the interaction parameters @xmath136 and @xmath14 in fig .  [ fig7 ]",
    ". thus , an accurate description of the vibrational and electronic dynamics as well as their couplings is essential to obtain a quantitative description of the many - body quantum dynamics and the transport characteristics .",
    "in this paper we have employed the ml - mctdh - sqr method to study correlated electron transport through model single - molecule junctions .",
    "extending our previous work,@xcite we have considered models which include both electron - electron and electron - vibrational interaction .",
    "the ml - mctdh - sqr method allows an accurate , in principle numerically exact treatment of this many - body quantum transport problem including both the transient dynamics and the steady state .",
    "the results obtained for selected model systems demonstrate the complex interplay of electronic and vibrational dynamics .",
    "for example , strong electron - vibrational coupling may result in a pronounced suppression of the electrical current ( phonon blockade ) , which is accompanied by the formation of a polaron - like state .",
    "including electron - electron interaction , this suppression of the current can be partially lifted because the transport channel provided by the doubly occupied bridge state shifts into the conductance window .    in the present work we have considered a model with a single electronic state at the molecular bridge",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the ml - mctdh - sqr method can also be applied to more complex models with various electronic states and interacting electrons in the leads .",
    "in addition to transport problems it may also be used to describe photoinduced dynamics in molecular adsorbates at metal or semiconductor surfaces including a proper description of correlation effects . another important phenomenon in correlated electron transport",
    "is the kondo effect.@xcite the application of the methodology to simulate transport in the kondo regime , in particular for very small voltage , requires special discretization techniques ( e.g. , the scheme pioneered by wilson@xcite ) and can be facilitated by the use of correlated initial states .",
