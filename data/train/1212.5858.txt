    "<S> we show numerically that light beams of different frequencies can be trapped sharply in different spatial locations , rendering wideband trapping of light .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene , a flat monolayer of graphite with carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has many interesting physical properties with great promise in nanoelectronics owing to its unique electronic properties , e.g. , conical dispersion ( dirac cones ) in the electronic band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by graphene , its photonic analog , namely , two - dimensional photonic crystals @xcite that possess dirac cones in photonic band structures , have drawn considerable attention in recent years @xcite . the existence of dirac cones may lead to many interesting optical phenomena such as conical diffraction and gap solitons @xcite , pseudodiffusive transport of light @xcite , zitterbewegung of photons @xcite and the realization of zero - refractive - index materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> wideband trapping of light , also called `` rainbow '' trapping , is an optical phenomenon that light of different frequencies can be slowed down and stopped at different spatial positions in specially designed waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has many potential applications ranging from optical information storage to enhanced light - matter interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several structures for realizing wideband trapping have been proposed , including metamaterial waveguides @xcite , plasmonic waveguides @xcite , metal - coated optical nano waveguides @xcite and plasmonic gratings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these structures may suffer inevitably a serious problem of optical loss due to constituting metals , which are rather lossy especially in the visible regime . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , dielectric photonic crystal waveguides can also slow light with a very small loss @xcite , which could be exploited in light trapping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but they are usually multimodal @xcite , which may lead to undesirable mode coupling .    by breaking the inversion symmetry of photonic crystals that possess dirac cones , a photonic band gap ( pbg ) around dirac points </S>",
    "<S> may open up @xcite . with </S>",
    "<S> the presence of edges , edge states within the pbg may appear with a sharp confinement of optical fields at the edges @xcite . with further breaking the time - reversal symmetry , confined edge states become even unidirectional , showing robustness against scattering or disorder @xcite . in this paper , we show theoretically that edge states in honeycomb photonic crystals ( hpcs ) can be exploited in realizing wideband trapping of light . </S>",
    "<S> since no metal is introduced , the optical loss should be much lower than those in metamaterial and plasmonic waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> compared with photonic crystal waveguides , our system is unimodal and more compact as well . </S>",
    "<S> although exemplified by hpcs with rods being infinitely long , our idea can be applied to two - dimensional photonic crystals with finite rod lengths or membrane photonic crystals with drilled holes @xcite .    , @xmath0 and @xmath1 representing points of high symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the inter - distance between adjacent rods is denoted by @xmath9 . in an infinite hpc </S>",
    "<S> , there are two different sets of rods whose radii are denoted respectively by @xmath10 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of edge rods , which are changeable , is denoted by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant of an hpc is thus @xmath12 . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric constant of all rods is taken to be 11.4 , a typical value for silicon at telecommunication wavelengths . in our following discussions , we only consider the transverse magnetic polarization , i.e. , the case that the electric field is parallel to the rods .    in figure [ fig1](c ) , photonic band structures of infinite hpcs , calculated by a plane - wave expansion method @xcite , are shown . </S>",
    "<S> for an hpc possessing the inversion symmetry , i.e. , @xmath13 , dirac points exist where the first and second photonic bands cross each other at the @xmath1 point with a reduced frequency of @xmath14 . with broken inversion symmetry , i.e. , @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the degeneracy at the @xmath1 point will be lifted and a pbg will open up @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower ( upper ) edge of the pbg is defined by the first ( second ) photonic band at the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) point .    to attain an hpc with an optimal or desired pbg </S>",
    "<S> , one can tune the radius of the rods or adjust the dielectric constant of the rods . in figure [ fig1](d ) , the pbg map as a function of @xmath5 for fixed @xmath3 is shown . for @xmath2 , there is no pbg due to the existence of the dirac points . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath15 , a pbg always exists . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the pbg ranges in reduced frequency @xmath6 from 0.26 to 0.343 . for @xmath3 and @xmath16 , the relative pbg width , @xmath17 , can be as high as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pbg width and </S>",

    "<S> . doted circles stand for the rods.,width=377 ]    figure [ fig2](a ) shows the dispersion of edge states of an hpc with a zigzag edge , calculated by the plane - wave expansion method @xcite . in our calculations , </S>",
    "<S> a supercell with a size of @xmath7 along the edge direction and @xmath28 along the direction perpendicular to the edge direction is used . </S>",
    "<S> periodical boundary conditions are imposed in both directions . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell contains a finite hpc with a thickness of @xmath29 along the direction perpendicular to the edge direction , corresponding to 48 rows of rods including the edge rods . </S>",
    "<S> since the separation of the two zigzag edges are large enough , there is no coupling between the two edges . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dispersion can thus be considered as that for a single zigzag edge of a semi - infinite hpc . </S>",
    "<S> projected photonic bands are obtained by projecting the bulk photonic band structure over the wavevector along the edge direction , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to photonic bands , for a given radius of the edge rods @xmath11 , an edge state may appear between the first and second photonic bands . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this edge state is unimodal , whose dispersion depends on @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> .    even for different values of @xmath11 , the dispersion of the edge state has a similar behaviour : its frequency increases with increasing @xmath21 up to the brillouin zone boundary @xmath23 . at @xmath23 , it takes a zero slope . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , the group velocity decreases with increasing @xmath21 and approaches zero at the brillouin zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this interesting feature could be exploited to slow down and even stop light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of an edge state at @xmath23 is dubbed cutoff frequency since the frequencies of the edge state at other wavevectors are always smaller than the cutoff frequency . for different values of @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cutoff frequency is different , showing a monotonic decrease with increasing @xmath11 , as shown in the inset of figure [ fig2](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note that edge states lie below the light line , implying that they are evanescent waves . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b)(d ) , the field distributions for the edge state with @xmath25 at different @xmath21 are shown . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , optical fields are confined to the edge rods . for the edge mode at @xmath26 , it is near the first photonic band , leading to some bulk excitations in the vicinity of the edge , which can be clearly seen from figure [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the edge modes away from the photonic bands there are nearly no bulk excitations . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by us @xcite , these edge modes are of subwavelength , similar to surface plasmons bounded at metallic surfaces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as aforementioned , an edge state at its cutoff frequency has a zero group velocity and the cutoff frequency decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these features can render wideband trapping of light by taking advantage of edge states , provided that the edge rods are designed to have a spatially graded variation in radius . </S>",
    "<S> if the grade is small enough , the graded edge can be considered approximately as a series of small edges , in each of which the edge rods possess a constant radius . as a result , each location seems to have a different cutoff frequency . for a wave propagating along such a graded edge </S>",
    "<S> , its group velocity will be gradually reduced along the edge direction and eventually approach zero in a location where the corresponding cutoff frequency coincide with the frequency of the wave . in other words , the wave will stop around this location .     for an hpc with a graded zigzag edge at different reduced frequencies ( a ) 0.276 , ( b ) 0.286 , and ( c ) 0.297 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius parameters for the hpc are @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a right - propagating gaussian beam of different frequencies is launched at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> circles denote dielectric rods . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom ( top ) horizontal axis indicates the position ( radius of edge rods ) along the edge direction.,width=510 ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows light trapping for different frequencies at the graded zigzag edge of an hpc , simulated by a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the radii of the edge rods are assumed to vary linearly with the position of the edge rods , namely , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the position along the edge direction . in our fdtd simulations , </S>",
    "<S> a continuous gaussian beam with an intensity of 1 and a width of @xmath33 is launched at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> perfectly matched layer absorbing boundaries @xcite are used .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , from figure [ fig3 ] light beams of different frequency can be trapped spatially in different locations . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario is as follows . for a right - propagating gaussian beam </S>",
    "<S> , it will propagate rightwards after launching . </S>",
    "<S> the beam will be slowed down towards right since its group velocity decreases rightwards due to the reduction of the radius of the edge rods . </S>",
    "<S> it will eventually be stopped around the location where the corresponding cutoff frequency of the location coincides with the beam frequency . by inspecting the beam with a reduced frequency of 0.286 , for example </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum intensity of the standstill beam occurs around the position @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the edge rods around this location is about @xmath35 , very close to but a bit smaller than the radius of @xmath36 that offers a cutoff frequency of 0.286 [ see the inset of figure [ fig2](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the standstill beam , there are some small additional peaks on the left side of the main peak . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the right - propagating wave may get reflected more or less since the grade of the edge rods is not small enough . </S>",
    "<S> the reflected and the right - propagating waves may interfere with each other , leading to these small additional peaks , which could be suppressed in principle by using a finer grade .    in summary , we studied theoretically the edge states at the zigzag edge of hpcs consisting of dielectric rods in air for the transverse magnetic polarization . </S>",
    "<S> with broken inversion symmetry , a pbg exists between the first and second photonic bands . </S>",
    "<S> a unimodal edge state may appear within the pbg , whose dispersion and cutoff frequency can be tuned by changing the radius of the edge rods . for a zigzag edge with a gradually graded radius in edge rods , light beams of different frequencies </S>",
    "<S> can be slowed down and trapped spatially in different locations . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that edge states in hpcs could be exploited in optical storage and enhanced light - matter interactions . + this work was supported by the 973 program ( grant nos . </S>",
