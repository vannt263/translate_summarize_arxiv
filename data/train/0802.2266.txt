    "rather our goal is to use the methods of effective field theory ( eft ) in order to analyze the very longest range ( smallest momentum transfer ) contributions to the electromagnetic scattering process when one or both of the scattering particles are neutral .",
    "these long range components are associated with pieces of the scattering amplitude which are nonanalytic ( and singular ) in the momentum transfer .",

    "the electromagnetic interaction of two neutral systems having separation @xmath6 , the so - called van der waals force , was considered long ago by london@xcite , who gave a simple form for the interaction potential in terms of the electric polarizabilities of the two systems @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a typical excitation energy .",
    "the form of the vanderwaals potential can be understood in terms of the energy of the dipole moment of `` atom '' @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) in the electric field created by the dipole moment of `` atom '' @xmath11 @xmath12 of course , @xmath13 , _ i.e. _ , there exists no average dipole moment , so this energy change vanishes in first order perturbation theory @xmath14 however , there _ is _ a shift at second order since at any given instant of time there exists an _ instantaneous _",
    "dipole moment in atom @xmath11 say . the corresponding electric field from atom @xmath11 at the position of atom @xmath9@xmath15generates a correlated electric dipole moment due to its electric polarizability @xmath16 the electric field generated by _",
    "this _ electric dipole moment then acts back on the original atom , yielding an energy @xmath17 which is the van der waals interaction .",
    "what makes this work , then , is the point that one can use the _ instantaneous _ position of one atom to provide an action at a distance correlation with a second atom in the vicinity .",
    "finally , we note that the electric polarizability itself can be extracted by calculating the shift in energy of the atom in the presence of an external electric field @xmath18 in second order perturbation theory @xmath19 we find then @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that it is this _ self - interaction energy _ which is responsible for the london form .",
    "casimir and polder generated a general form for the interaction potential from quantum mechanics by using two - photon exchange and fourth - order noncovariant perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "their result reproduces the simple london form at short distance@xmath22 but at large distances , when retardation is important , _",
    "i.e. _ , when a typical quantum mechanical excitation time @xmath23 is smaller than the time for light to travel between the two particles @xmath24 then the london potential , which depends upon the correlation between the instantaneous positions of the two systems , breaks down and the interaction evolves into the ong distance asymptotic form @xmath25 that the very long distance asymptotic form must vary as @xmath26 is clear from simple scaling , as argued by kaplan@xcite .",
    "the argument is elementary  since polarizabilities have units of volume , and since the interparticle separation is the only scale in the problem , the form of the potential must be @xmath27 the derivation of the casimir - polder form  eq .",
    "[ eq : cas]within modern quantum field theory was given by feinberg and sucher using dispersive methods@xcite . in an impressive calculation using simple assumptions involving analyticity they were able to obtain the casimir - polder result .",
    "in this section we shall show how the same form can be obtained in a much simpler and more direct fashion using the methods of effective field theory .",
