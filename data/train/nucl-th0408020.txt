    "in nuclear astrophysics , the key issue is the determination of cross sections at very low energies , representative of stellar conditions . because of the coulomb repulsion between nuclei , these cross sections are sometimes minuscule , in particular for non - resonant processes , and hence very hard to measure .",
    "nuclear theory has thus an important role to play for the extrapolation of measured data down to astrophysical energies .",
    "a reliable extrapolation requires ( i ) a precise fit of all available data , ( ii ) a good account for both resonant and non - resonant processes , ( iii ) a small number of parameters to limit the extrapolation uncertainty .",
    "the r - matrix phenomenological model @xcite is the only one to date which is able to precisely fit experimental data ; however , whereas its description of discrete ( resonant ) states is satisfactory , its description of the non - resonant background , based on phenomenological high - energy wide states , requires a lot of additional parameters and lacks physical motivation .",
    "i demonstrate here the interest of the potential model for a better description of the background , complemented by an r - matrix phenomenological description of discrete states .",
    "such hybrid models have already been used in previous works @xcite but the model developed here presents two new features .",
    "first ( section 2 ) , discrete states are characterized by physical parameters ( energy and width ) rather than by formal r - matrix parameters , a procedure recently advocated for in the traditional r - matrix method @xcite .",
    "second ( section 3 ) , the potential model is constructed by inversion of scattering data , which leads to a better - quality fit than phenomenological potentials like the woods - saxon one . as an example , i apply the method to the @xmath2-wave phase shifts deduced @xcite from a recent high - precision measurement of the @xmath0c  +  @xmath1 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "this analysis is preliminary to the analysis of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves for this system , which dominate the capture reaction at astrophysical energies .",
    "for these waves , the present method could lead to a better description of the interference effects between the background and the subthreshold states , which are known to strongly influence the reaction rate at astrophysical energies .",
    "the @xmath5 subthreshold state has recently been studied in the framework of the inversion potential model @xcite but a generalization to a hybrid model is necessary to study the @xmath6 subthreshold state and to get a precise fit of all available data .",
    "i use the hybrid potential / r - matrix model presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "the general principle is to calculate , for a given partial wave , the r - matrix corresponding to the potential model , @xmath7 , and to add to it phenomenological poles corresponding to discrete states .",
    "this leads to the total r - matrix @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the center - of - mass energy and only one channel is considered for simplicity ( this is sufficient for @xmath0c  +  @xmath1 elastic scattering ) .",
    "discrete states are characterized by their formal energy @xmath10 and reduced width @xmath11 .",
    "the main advantage of the above formula is its simplicity , which also implies a very convenient use in numerical calculations .",
    "its drawback is that the formal parameters can not be directly interpreted as physical state properties : their value depend on the r - matrix radius and boundary parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this creates strong parameter correlations in r - matrix numerical fits where the r - matrix radius itself can be varied .",
    "it is thus preferable to use physical parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 as fitting parameters and to convert them into formal parameters for the actual calculation of the fitted quantity . in the usual r - matrix formalism , the scattering ( s )",
    "matrix is factorized into a hard - sphere ( hs ) factor and an r - matrix factor , the behavior of the latter around resonances defining physical parameters : @xmath15r(e ) } { 1-[l(e)-b]r(e ) } , \\quad l(e)=s(e)+\\imath p(e ) , \\label{srmat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the phase shift , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the shift and penetration factors , respectively  @xcite . here",
    ", we want to define physical parameters with respect to the potential s matrix rather than to the hard - sphere one . by inserting eq .",
    "[ rhyb ] into eq .",
    "[ srmat ] , one gets a different factorization for the s - matrix : @xmath17^{-1}-r_\\mathrm{pot}(e)\\right\\}^{-1}r_\\mathrm{res}(e ) } { 1-\\left\\{[l(e)-b]^{-1}-r_\\mathrm{pot}(e)\\right\\}^{-1}r_\\mathrm{res}(e)}. \\label{shyb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparison of the last factors of eqs .  [ srmat ] and [ shyb ]",
    "shows that existing r - matrix methods transforming physical parameters into formal ones can directly be applied to the hybrid case , provided @xmath18 $ ] is replaced by @xmath19^{-1}-r_\\mathrm{pot}(e)\\right\\}^{-1}$ ] . in refs .",
    "@xcite , such methods are proposed that take into account the interference of the different r - matrix poles with each other .",
    "although these methods could be generalized to the hybrid case , the interference effects are much less important here since no wide pole is used to describe the background . up to now , i have found sufficient to use the one - pole approximation for which , for instance , the physical to formal energy conversion formula reads @xmath20 + r_\\mathrm{pot}^2(\\widetilde{e}_\\lambda ) |l(\\widetilde{e}_\\lambda)-b|^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the conversion formula for the width is too long to be given here .",
    "these formulas are used for the @xmath0c  +  @xmath1 one - pole example of fig .",
    "[ d0hybbw ] , for which i have checked that the best - fit physical parameters of the resonance ( @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 kev ) are practically independent of the r - matrix radius ( above 12 fm , see next section ) and hence very convenient fitting parameters , contrary to formal parameters .",
    "an inversion technique based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been successfully applied to the @xmath0c  +  @xmath1 system in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a given partial wave ,",
    "this method allows the deductive construction of a potential reproducing elastic - scattering phase shifts .",
    "this method is based on a rational expansion in the complex wave - number @xmath23-plane of the partial - wave s matrix @xmath24 where the poles @xmath25 are fitted to the phase shifts .",
    "they can be determined either by resolution of the linear system of equations giving the coefficients of the polynomials appearing in the s matrix @xcite or with a general minimization procedure @xcite .",
    "this last method , though less deductive , allows one to easily constrain the poles to stay on the imaginary axis , which avoids oscillations in the obtained potential .",
    "this effective potential is constructed iteratively by algebraic ( supersymmetric ) transformations of the radial schrdinger equation @xmath26 , with a number of transformations equal to the number @xmath27 of poles of the s matrix .",
    "the potential @xmath28 and its corresponding s matrix @xmath29 are references which can be chosen arbitrarily . for a system without coulomb interaction ,",
    "one generally chooses @xmath30 ; the supersymmetric transformations can then be performed analytically and the final potential has a compact expression in terms of exponential functions . for a system with coulomb interaction ,",
    "one generally chooses @xmath28 as the pure coulomb potential .",
    "however , this has the drawback that individual transformations then create long - range @xmath31 terms in the potential .",
    "these can be approximately canceled by successive transformations , provided most s - matrix poles lie roughly on a circle around the origin of the complex plane , but this requires a rather large number of poles and generally creates small oscillations in the potential @xcite .",
    "for instance , to perfectly reproduce the @xmath0c  +  @xmath1 @xmath2-wave phase shits represented in fig .",
    "[ d0hybbw ] , 10 poles are needed for a pure coulomb @xmath28 . this makes the construction of the potential rather heavy from the numerical point of view , which is not very suitable for applications ; moreover , the potential presents slight oscillations .",
    "an alternative method used here is to construct by supersymmetric transformations the nuclear part of the potential instead of the total effective potential .",
    "one starts from @xmath30 , constructs the nuclear potential @xmath32 , adds coulomb and centrifugal terms to it and only then calculates ( nuclear ) phase shifts .",
    "the fit can only be made by automatic minimization procedure in this case .",
    "this method presents several advantages : the nuclear potential is short - ranged , it has a compact analytical expression and the number of poles is small , which facilitates numerical fits . for instance , the fit presented in fig .",
    "[ d0hybbw ] has been obtained with only two poles at wave number @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "no significantly better fit could be obtained without introducing small oscillations in the potential .",
    "the corresponding effective potential is represented in fig .",
    "[ p0hybbw ] , together with the pure coulomb potential .",
    "@xmath35 is a purely repulsive _ soft - sphere _ potential ( no bound or resonant state ) becoming negligible above 12 fm .",
    "this large range is rather surprising : in usual r - matrix calculations @xcite , the range of the nuclear interaction is generally estimated between 5.5 and 6.5 fm . here , a larger r - matrix radius has to be used .",
    "a range of 12 fm could indicate a polarization phenomenon .",
    "more probably , it could just mean that the soft - sphere potential , which generalizes the hard - sphere potential of r - matrix fits , has no strong physical meaning either .",
    "this seems confirmed by the fact that i could not find , up to now , an @xmath36-independent soft - sphere potential describing the background in several partial waves simultaneously .",
    "a more promising way is to use a deep potential with bound and resonant states corresponding to physical and pauli - forbidden @xmath37o states .",
    "such potentials can also be constructed by inversion @xcite and i plan to test their interest for the hybrid model in the near future ."
