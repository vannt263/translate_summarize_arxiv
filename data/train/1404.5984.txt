    "modeling species interactions occupies a central theme in spatial ecology and mathematical biology .",
    "many of these models take the form of reaction diffusion equations , where the reaction terms describe both inter - species and intra - species dynamics , including factors such as birth and death .",
    "the diffusion represents random spatial movement of the species .",
    "recently there has been a lot of activity concerning models where the diffusion of one species may be influenced by another species .",
    "these models come under the class of strongly coupled parabolic systems @xcite and are also known in the literature as cross - diffusion systems .",
    "although these models may be more realistic from a biological or modeling point of view ( as they naturally incorporate inter - species and intra - species competition ) , they are more difficult to handle mathematically than their constant coefficient , pure diffusion counterparts .",
    "their classical applications are immense and there are new potential applications ranging from bee pollination @xcite to pedestrian flow @xcite . among the first efforts to model cross - diffusion was the model system proposed in @xcite by shigesada , kawasaki and teramoto .",
    "this model and its variants are now known as skt models . for a detailed steady state analysis of this model",
    "one can see @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "we consider the following cross - diffusion system which is a generalized form of the skt model , @xmath0 = f(u , v)\\;=u\\left ( a_{1}-b_{1}u+c_{1}v\\right ) \\;\\;\\;\\text{in } \\mathbb{r}^{+}\\times \\omega , \\ ] ] @xmath1 = g(u , v)=v\\left ( a_{2}+b_{2}u - c_{2}v\\right ) \\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{in } \\mathbb{r}^{+}\\times \\omega , \\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath2 and the initial data @xmath3 where @xmath4 also , to simplify the notations , we let @xmath5the domain @xmath6 is an open bounded domain of class @xmath7 in @xmath8 , with boundary @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the outward normal derivative on @xmath9 .",
    "the components @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the solution to system - , are nonnegative functions , and represent the population densities of the prey and predator species , respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are positive constants representing the random diffusion rates of the two species respectively .",
    "the initial data are functions in @xmath15 and assumed to be nonnegative which imply , via the maximum principle @xcite , the positivity of the solution on its interval of existence .",
    "the constants @xmath16 are any real numbers with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are either nonpostive or both positive , and sufficiently small .",
    "also we may have @xmath20 , with one positive and one negative , with the positive one sufficiently small in , .",
    "the constants @xmath21 are nonnegative constants : @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the self - diffusion rates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cross - diffusion rates and @xmath26 are the gradient cross - diffusions . when @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 then - is in fact the skt model @xcite .",
    "however when the reaction diffusion systems include cross - diffusion as in - , there are not many results : when @xmath31 @xmath32 an analogous system describing epidemics , m. kirane and s. kouachi established in a series of papers @xcite studying global existence and asymptotics .",
    "shim @xcite proved the existence of global solutions to - in the space dimension @xmath33 , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 or when @xmath36 and @xmath37 also in the space dimension @xmath38 the same author established global existence when @xmath39 recently , xu in @xcite showed global existence when @xmath40 in two cases : when @xmath41 or when @xmath42 and @xmath43 the condition @xmath44 implies by simple application of the maximum principle , the uniform boudedness of @xmath45 on @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the eventual blowing - up time in @xmath48 there is a large literature on this class of models , and the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the global existence of weak solutions under natural conditions is settled @xcite . recently a number of sophisticated tools that include the use of compatano and morrey spaces , as well as entropy functional techniques have been devised and applied to these problems . for details",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "also , there have been recent efforts to prove global boundedness of weak solutions to cross diffusion systems , using an entropy functional approach @xcite . on the more applied side ,",
    "yong et al .",
    "@xcite considered a diffusion system , modeling the interactions between honey bees and solitary bees using a form of the skt model .",
    "they derive a number of interesting conclusions from their work by restricting the self - diffusion and cross - diffusion coefficients and compare their simulation results to field data @xcite    we focus on @xcite , where the author considered - , however he imposed the restriction that the reaction terms should be negative if either @xmath11 or @xmath49 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is not necessary in our case , since the second reaction term can be large for @xmath50 . in @xcite",
    "the author proves global existence when @xmath51 and @xmath19 are non - positive , under the following conditions @xmath52 when @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are of opposite signs , the system is the well - known lotka - volterra prey - predator model . in this case and for more general reactions and boundary conditions",
    "many results have been obtained . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "our primary contributions in this paper are the following : +   + 1 ) we prove boundedness of solutions to - via theorem [ thm : t21 ] , when @xmath57and @xmath58 under the following condition @xmath59it is clear that our condition is weaker than .",
    "we next use the everywhere regularity result of bounded solutions to - , via theorem [ thm : t11 ] from @xcite to : +   + 2 ) deduce global existence of solutions , without restriction on the space dimension , to - , via our new condition .",
    "this is more general than @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished via theorem [ thm : t22 ] .",
    "+   + we then perform numerical simulations under the following strategy : +   + 3 ) we choose parameters that satisfy condition , whilst violating . with this choice of parameters we simulate - for a host of different initial conditions . here",
    "we demonstarte that there are a host of initial conditions , for which we have globally existing solutions , for which the results of @xcite are not applicable , but our result theorem [ thm : t22 ] is indeed applicable .    for the benefit of the reader we recap",
    "the hlder continuity result via theorem [ thm : t11 ] , from @xcite    [ thm : t11 ] assume that @xmath60 and@xmath61let @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "this everywhere regularity result of bounded solutions to - obtained in @xcite is very interesting .",
    "however , the author was hindered , by not being able to show the boundedness and global existence when @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "he was only able to prove global existence in the case when @xmath67 and @xmath68 furthermore we remark that the second and third inequalities in conditions ( which was assumed to prove global existence in @xcite ) imply the first inequality when it is a strict inequality , and contradict it in the case of equality .    in section 2 we state our main results ,",
    "then we present our proofs in section 3 .",
    "lastly , in section 4 we present numerical simulations , that support our results theorems [ thm : t21 ] , [ thm : t22 ] .",
    "for initial conditions in @xmath69 , it was proved in @xcite that solutions to problems more general than - exist locally in time . for the global existence",
    ", it was proved that solutions to - exist globally in time if one has control on both of their @xmath70 and hlder norms .",
    "this is in contrast to classical reaction diffusion systems ( see @xcite ) where one need only control the l@xmath71 norms of solutions .",
    "counterexamples in @xcite confirmed this : bounded weak solutions of certain strongly coupled systems may blow up in finite time .",
    "our aim is to construct a polynomial lyapunov functional ( see @xcite ) depending on the solution @xmath72 of system - .",
    "we then use functional methods to derive their l@xmath71 bounds , via this functional .",
    "next , we apply known results to show their hlder continuity , and thus deduce their global existence .",
    "more precisely , we will use a quadratic form according to the solution @xmath72 of system - to prove the following result concerning the boundedness of solutions    [ thm : t21 ] consider @xmath57and @xmath58 , then under the following condition @xmath73 positive solutions of problem - are bounded on @xmath74 by constants depending on initial data and the reaction terms .",
    "then , we will use theorem [ thm : t11 ] to deduce that bounded solutions of system - are hlder continuous .",
    "we will give under stronger assumptions than those in theorem [ thm : t11 ] , the proof of the following    [ thm : t22 ] assume that @xmath75 then weak solutions with nonnegative initial data to - are classical and exist globally .    note that our conditions are weaker than .",
    "for example , when @xmath76 we can take @xmath77 and @xmath78 such that condition ( iii ) in is not satisfied , and the results of @xcite are not applicable . however , our condition ( iv ) in is still satisfied , and we have global existence .",
    "we consider here systems of two equations with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions , but our main results are applicable to those of more equations and with suitable other boundary conditions .    for a given function @xmath79 we will denote by @xmath80 the nonnegative part of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and with a slight abuse of notation , we will write @xmath83 and so on .",
    "in this section , we study the boundedness of solutions to - , for this purpose we consider the following quadratic form@xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are positive constants such that @xmath87 for some constant @xmath88 which we suppose @xmath89 to assure the positive definiteness of @xmath90 .",
