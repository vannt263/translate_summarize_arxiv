    "<S> we present a spatio - temporal mechanism for producing 2d optical rogue waves in the presence of a turbulent state with creation , interaction and annihilation of optical vortices . </S>",
    "<S> spatially periodic structures with bound phase lose stability to phase unbound turbulent states in complex ginzburg - landau and swift - hohenberg models with external driving . </S>",
    "<S> when the pumping is high and the external driving is low , synchronized oscillations are unstable and lead to spatio - temporal _ vortex - mediated _ turbulence with high excursions in amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear amplification leads to rogue waves close to turbulent optical vortices , where the amplitude tends to zero , and to probability density functions ( pdfs ) with long tails typical of extreme optical events .    </S>",
    "<S> rogue waves ( rws ) in high seas were once a thing of legend : massive walls of water tens of metres high , capable of destroying large ships , appearing from nowhere then vanishing leaving no trace of their existence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of the very short lifetime of such extreme events , quantitative studies and simulations of the mechanisms behind their creation in oceanography have grown only recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the origin of these waves is still under debate , rws have been realized in several optical systems @xcite from optical fibres @xcite , to optical cavities @xcite and photonic crystals @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate a spatio - temporal mechanism involving vortices in a 2d turbulent state that is capable of generating rws , building upon previous work concerning a singly resonant optical parametric oscillator system with a low amplitude detuned seeding field @xcite . for generality and application to a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems , we consider a forced complex ginzburg - landau ( fcgl ) equation @xcite and a forced complex swift - hohenberg ( fcsh ) equation , both with external driving . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the loss of synchronisation of the adler locked states obtained at large driving amplitudes . when decreasing the external forcing , oscillations at the adler frequency become spatio - temporally unstable leading first to a phase and then to an amplitude instability that forces , locally and randomly , the formation of pairs of oppositely charged vortices . since the total power in the transverse direction remains almost constant throughout , the nonlinearity pushes the intensity to high spikes close to interacting vortices , resulting in the rare formation of rws . </S>",
    "<S> the rws described here are outside thermodynamic equilibrium , do not survive in the purely temporal ( single mode ) case and are due to a deterministic , nonlinear and vortex - mediated turbulence far removed from a purely stochastic superposition of optical waves .    to demonstrate the generality of optical rws in vortex turbulence we employ a variety of mathematical models : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the complex field </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 is the ( real ) amplitude of the external forcing , @xmath3 is the frequency difference between the unperturbed field and the external driver , @xmath4 is the transverse laplacian , @xmath5 is the laser pump , @xmath6 is @xmath7 for the laser @xcite and @xmath8 for the optical parametric oscillator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time is normalised to the photon decay rate in the optical cavity and space to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cavity length and @xmath11 the wavelength . finally , @xmath12 is zero for the fcgl model and one for the fcsh case , where @xmath13 is a small parameter ( here fixed at 0.01 ) due to the fast dynamics of atomic variables in lasers @xcite . the fcgl and fcsh models can be applied in many other systems , e.g. chemical oscillations @xcite , granular media @xcite and hydrodynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the cases of relevance are obtained when the detuning @xmath3 is different from zero . in this case </S>",

    "<S> the uppermost lines in the @xmath14-shaped curves of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] correspond to the homogeneous locked states where the external driving is large enough to overcome the frequency difference with the injected device . </S>",
    "<S> when increasing @xmath2 , a saddle - node bifurcation heralds the onset of the frequency and phase locked homogeneous states . </S>",
    "<S> when , instead , decreasing the parameter @xmath2 the homogeneous solution loses stability to spatially periodic patterns with a critical wave - vector given by @xmath17 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the maximum and minimum intensities of the hexagonal patterns obtained numerically @xcite when reducing the external driver are displayed via a black dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> although the phase of the pattern is periodically modulated in space , the stationary character of these pattern solutions demonstrates that they are locked to the frequency of the injection . </S>",
    "<S> a typical hexagonal structure in the case of the fcgl equation with finite size input beams is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the area of the white square in ( b ) . ]    as the amplitude @xmath2 of the external drive is further reduced ( see shaded area in fig . [ fig1 ] ) , spatially periodic patterns become unstable and a regime of unlocked dynamics sets in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] shows the temporal evolution of an unstable hexagonal pattern in an argand ( @xmath20 versus @xmath21 ) diagram . the hexagonal pattern ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) is a phase bound solution that progressively loses stability along a circle in the argand diagram corresponding to a phase instability ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phase instability then grows into an amplitude instability ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) that leads to the formation and annihilation of pairs of oppositely charged vortices ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c and d ) and a regime of spatio - temporal irregularity similar to the vortex - mediated turbulence described in @xcite in the cgl in the absence of forcing ( see fig . [ fig3]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the helical waves propagating around the defects act as the driving force behind the turbulent state . a typical instantaneous intensity distribution of this turbulent state is presented in fig . [ fig2]b & </S>",
    "<S> c. the interacting vortices correspond to the localized regions of zero amplitude ( shown in black ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the turbulent dynamics of vortices is deterministically driven by the spatially coupled nonlinearity and not by the superposition of random waves typical of optical speckles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the case of speckle , the field distribution in the argand plane has a gaussian shape as opposed to the almost circular one shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> there are also noticeable intrinsic differences in the field correlations @xcite and in the pdfs of the intensity ( see below ) .     and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    to better understand the nature of the turbulent state in forced models ( [ model ] ) we consider dynamical solutions corresponding to unlocked oscillations and their robustness to spatially dependent perturbations in the fcgl model ( @xmath23 ) where analytical predictions are feasible . in the absence of spatial coupling an approximate limit cycle trajectory for the field can be found by period averaging methods , @xmath24}$ ] , @xcite , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is well approximated by its period average @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath30 is real , i.e. in the absence of locked states , the trajectory is the phase - drift solution of the adler equation @xcite , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> such solution is clearly phase unbound and is superimposed onto the argand diagram in the turbulent regime of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d to show that its underlying dynamics is ruled by the unlocked state . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the approximate solution has been checked for a wide range of @xmath2 values in the fcgl model . </S>",
    "<S> the excursions in intensity do not exceed 10% while those in frequency are well within 1% . </S>",
    "<S> we have then proceeded to study the stability of the spatially synchronized oscillation by including spatial coupling in the fcgl . </S>",
    "<S> the stability eigenvalues of the spatially synchronized limit cycle are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spatial wave - vector . </S>",
    "<S> at the critical wave - vector for pattern formation @xmath17 , the stability @xmath34 is marginal but perturbations due to the approximate nature of @xmath1 induce a slow instability of the synchronous oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvector associated with @xmath34 is along the limit cycle , again demonstrating a phase instability . as mentioned earlier </S>",
    "<S> , this phase instability grows into an amplitude instability and then into vortex - mediated turbulence as demonstrated numerically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , starting from low amplitude noise . a homogeneous zero state with added noise quickly evolves towards the unstable limit cycle ( from 0 to 4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the limit cycle dynamics first synchronises the spatial oscillations ( see the narrow line at @xmath35 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) and then moves towards the vortex turbulence state via phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) and amplitude ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we outline that the mechanism of spontaneous vortex creation in the fcgl and fcsh is not trivial . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the cgl , stationary vortex solutions are not possible in driven systems like ( [ model ] ) as all locked states have bound phases around that of the injection . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low driving amplitudes , moving vortices and vortex - mediated turbulence in ( [ model ] ) are possible due to the adler unlocked dynamics of the limit cycle trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that the adiabatic elimination of the polarization variable introduces an all wave - vector instability of the spatially homogeneous state below the point where the linear stability of the lower branch of the @xmath14-shaped homogeneous state predicts complex conjugate eigenvalues ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature , in principle , may have serious consequences in the turbulent regimes . a second important consequence of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , however , is that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) for @xmath23 displays a very fast dynamics that takes the system towards the limit cycle where large wave - vector instabilities are promptly eliminated ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) ) . the large wave - vector instability of the lower branch of the homogeneous stationary states is not present in the case of fcsh when @xmath36 .     and @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) : t=90 ( black ) , t=256 ( red ) , t=280 ( blue ) and t=314 ( green ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism for vortex turbulence is essential for the generation of rws in externally driven systems described by the spatio - temporal dynamics of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are outside thermodynamic equilibrium , do not display relaxation oscillations and present a delicate balance between the energy input and the losses ( the pump @xmath5 , injection @xmath2 , nonlinearity @xmath6 and output mirror ) . during the turbulent evolution , the total power @xmath38 remains almost constant at values close to those of the laser with no injection ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a ) . by considering the energy density and the energy flux of the fcgl equation @xcite the time evolution of the power is given by @xmath39 dx dy \\frac{\\partial \\cal p } { \\partial t } = 2 \\int \\left [ e_{in } re(e ) + \\left ( p - 1   - \\frac{p}{3 } |e|^2 \\right ) |e|^2 \\right ] dx dy \\label{eqn : power}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the transverse plane . for the approximate limit cycle solution the power @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> is conserved at the value of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the beam width of the input laser . in the turbulent state , </S>",
    "<S> however , maintaining an almost constant power in the presence of moving vortices of zero intensity implies the simultaneous appearance of large amplitude spikes . </S>",
    "<S> if the vortex density is large , multi - vortex collisions can occur with the production of large , short - lived spikes in the intensity ( see fig . [ fig5]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> short - lived large intensity spikes are rare but possible events , fitting the characteristics of rws . </S>",
    "<S> the particular shape and symmetry of these spikes is crucially determined by the number and position of the surrounding vortices , a feature that is unique to this particular mechanism of rw formation . </S>",
    "<S> rws in single transverse mode class - b lasers with injected signals have been observed in @xcite but due to relaxation oscillations and not to 2d vortex turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , without spatial coupling due to diffraction , no rws can be observed in systems described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) . to characterize our spatio - temporal rws </S>",
    "<S> , we use a commonly accepted definition of statistically rare events @xcite , i.e. if the intensity of the field at a spatial point over a long period of time is greater than the mean wave height plus eight standard deviations then the wave can be classified as an extreme event or rw , similarly to the significant peak intensity method @xcite .     and @xmath43 and for the fcgl ( solid lines ) and fcsh ( dashed lines ) models during vortex turbulence . </S>",

    "<S> very similar results have been obtained for the fcsh and different nonlinearities such as those of the fcsh and the singly resonant opo , thus demonstrating the universality of the phenomenon .    in conclusion , we demonstrate a mechanism for producing rws in the transverse area of externally driven nonlinear optical devices via vortex turbulence . given the universality of our model , this mechanism should be observable in a large variety of systems . </S>",

    "<S> optics , vortex - mediated turbulence without driving has been observed in nematic liquid crystals @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite and fluid dynamics @xcite . in the unlocked regime of these systems with driving , vortex turbulence can excite rws and lead to the formation of highly inhomogeneous fields with non - gaussian statistics .    </S>",

    "<S> the fcgl and fcsh models studied here are active , non - conservative systems outside thermodynamic equilibrium where many of the methods developed for the nls can not be applied . in the nls equation , as well as in the cgl and csh equations , stationary vortex solutions are possible although mainly unstable . in the presence of forcing , vortices can only exist in dynamical states . </S>",
    "<S> it is exactly in these situations that we have demonstrated rws close to regions of interaction of turbulent vortices . </S>",
    "<S> because of universality , suitably perturbed nls models may also display these features .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike rws in the longitudinal direction @xcite , the aspect ratios required for transverse rws induced by 2d vortex turbulence are extremely small ( typical input beams have diameters less than 1@xmath55 ) and the statistics require times of the order of hundreds of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the small aspect ratio , the full 2d character and the quick dynamics represent the major advantages of transverse optical devices in studying the generation and control of rws with applications , by universality , in hydrodynamics and oceanography . </S>"
