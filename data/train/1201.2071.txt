    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has motivated the developments of several alternative theories of gravity .",
    "these models are built up , typically , either in the framework of the conventional general relativity ( gr ) or in the framework of its possible generalizations or modifications . in the last years , among the different approaches proposed to generalize einstein s gr , the so called @xmath0 gravity has received a growing attention .",
    "the reason relies on the fact that such an approach allows to address the problem of the observed accelerating phase of the universe , without invoking exotic sources of dark energy but just extending the standard paradigm of gr .",
    "the gravitational lagrangian for these theories is a generic function of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath7 ( not necessarily linear as in the hilbert - einstein action ) , and the corresponding action with the inclusion of standard matter reads @xmath8\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "it is a difficult task to deal with higher order terms in the scalar curvature , thus the forms of @xmath0 that have been most studied in literature are analytic functions of the forms @xmath10 or @xmath11 with @xmath12 positive or negative .",
    "also broken power laws have been extensively considered @xcite .",
    "current cosmological observations indicate that our universe is dominated by dark matter , responsible of galactic and extragalactic dynamics as well as of structure formations , and dark energy , responsible of the accelerated expansion of the universe . in other words , these unknown ingredients mean that we need a source to cluster large scale structure and a source to speed up the hubble fluid .",
    "the ratio between the cold dark matter and the dark energy with the critical density satisfies the bounds @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "although many models have been proposed , the nature of the two components is still unknown .",
    "favorite candidates for non - baryonic cold dark matter are the so called wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles )",
    ". however , such particles have not been detected yet .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the implications of the modified cosmology provided by @xmath0 gravity to the thermal relic abundance .",
    "alternative cosmologies indeed predict modified thermal histories for relic particles .",
    "these modifications , in principle , occur during the _ pre _ big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch , a period of the universe evolution not directly constrained by cosmological observations . to account for the enhancement of the expansion rates that cosmological models provide with respect to gr",
    ", it is usual to write @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the expansion rates of the alternative cosmological model and of gr , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath19 is the enhancement factor .",
    "its temperature dependence is such that @xmath20 at large temperature and @xmath21 before bbn set up , i.e. eq . ( [ h = ahgr ] ) holds at early times , while at later time @xmath22 .",
    "this last requirement is necessary due to the successful prediction of bbn on the abundance of primordial light elements .",
    "different cosmological scenarios have been proposed in literature to constrain the function @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "when the expansion rate of the universe is enhanced ( as compared to that one derived in the framework of gr ) , thermal relics decouple with larger relic abundance . the change in the hubble rate may have therefore its imprint on the relic abundance of dark matter , such as wimps , axions , heavy neutrinos .",
    "this kind of studies is motivated by recent astrophysical results which involve cosmic ray electrons and positrons @xcite , antiprotons @xcite , and @xmath23-rays @xcite .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the rising behavior of the positron fraction observed in pamela experiment @xcite . besides the astrophysical interpretation of this phenomenon @xcite ,",

    "more specifically , pamela and atic ( advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) data require a cross section of the order or larger than @xmath25 @xmath26 sec@xmath15 : in this case thermal relics would have the observed dark matter density @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we want to investigate if such data and constraints can be framed in the context of @xmath0 gravity .",

    "iii we write down the expressions for the _ energy density _ and _ pressure _ induced by higher order curvature - terms for a power law function of the scale factor .",
    "we then consider examples of @xmath0 models in which the ratio of the _ curvature energy density _ and _ curvature pressure _ is constant . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the cosmic enhancement in view of the abundance of thermal relics recalling the main results reported in @xcite .",
    "v is devoted to the study of the amplification factor given by ( [ h = ahgr ] ) in the framework of @xmath0 models .",
    "the pre - bbn epoch is considered in sec .",
    "in such a case , @xmath0-models are less `` fine - tuned '' and several of them , in principle , could fit the pamela data . in sec .",
    "vii we apply the conformal transformations to recast the @xmath0 gravity in terms of gr plus a scalar field .",
    "the latter gives rise to an effective potential related to the from of @xmath0 and its derivative .",

    "we report some useful formulas adopted in the main text .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ lagr ] ) with respect to the metric yields the field equations @xmath27 where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath28 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "here @xmath29 stands for radiation ( @xmath30 ) or standard matter ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "it is defined as @xmath37 it gives rise to an _ effective _ description of the source term of einstein field equations .",
    "a comment is in order . in the right - hand side of eq.([eqcampo2 ] ) two effective fluids appear indeed : a _ curvature fluid _ and a standard _",

    "in which @xmath63 is independent of cosmic time , as provided by some models of @xmath0 gravity , the previous equation reads @xmath64 moreover , the equation of continuity for matter gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the adiabatic index .",

    "as we shall see , the alternative cosmology provided by @xmath0 gravity allows to explain pamela s results for tiny deviations from gr .",
    "while the approach to matter fluid is standard , the curvature fluid requires a detailed discussion as discussed in the next section .",
    "as well known , the high nonlinearity of @xmath0 gravity makes quite difficult to get exact solutions of field equations @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in finding cosmological scenarios where @xmath63 is constant in order to compare it with the proper matter adiabatic index @xmath67 .    a possibility to get a constant @xmath63",

    "according to standard cosmology and particle physics , the calculation of the relic density of particles is based on the assumption that the period of the universe dominated by radiation began before the main production of relics and that the entropy of matter is conserved during this epoch and the successive one .",
    "clearly , a different relic density of particles is expected once these assumptions are modified . in this scenario , therefore , any contribution to the energy density modifies the hubble expansion rate , which reflects in a modification of the relic density values . along these lines",

    "<S> the cosmological consequences of @xmath0 gravity are reviewed in the framework of recent data obtained by pamela ( payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this collaboration has reported an excess of positron events that can not be explained by conventional cosmology and particle physics , and are usually ascribed to the dark matter presence ( in particular , weak interacting massive particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter interpretation of pamela data has motivated the study of alternative cosmological models ( with respect to the standard cosmology ) owing to the fact that they predict an enhancement of the hubble expansion rate , giving rise , in such a way , to thermal relics with a larger relic abundance . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that @xmath0 cosmology allows to explain the pamela puzzle for dark matter relic particles with masses of the order or lesser than @xmath1 gev in the regime @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the curvature density and @xmath4 the radiation density . for the model @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , it then follows that @xmath6 and small corrections with respect to general relativity could lead indeed to address the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> however other interesting cosmological models can be considered during the pre - bbn epoch as soon as the bbn constraints are relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the pamela data can be fitted for a larger class of @xmath0-models . </S>"
