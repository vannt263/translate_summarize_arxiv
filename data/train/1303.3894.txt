    "supernova ( sn ) observations , especially of type iin ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) , indicate that some massive stars lose considerable amounts of mass ( @xmath8m@xmath3 ) within a few months to years prior to their explosions ( e.g. , dopita et al . 1984 ; chugai et al . 1994 , 2004 ; ofek et al .",

    "have been suggested .",
    "quataert & shiode ( 2012 ) suggest that in some massive stars the super - eddington fusion luminosities , shortly prior to core collapse , can drive convective motions , that in turn excite gravity waves that propagate toward the stellar surface .",
    "the dissipation of these waves can unbind up to several solar masses of the stellar envelope . in ofek",
    "et al . ( 2013b ) we argued that this mechanism can unbind a lower amount of mass ( @xmath9m@xmath3 ) .",
    "arnett & meakin ( 2011 ) suggested that shell oxygen burning in massive stars produces large fluctuations in the turbulent kinetic energy , that in turn may produce bursts .",
    "chevalier ( 2012 ) suggested that the mass loss is driven by a common - envelope phase due to the inspiral of a neutron star into a giant companion core , unbinding the companion envelope and setting up accretion onto the neutron star , that in turn collapses into a black hole and triggers a sn explosion .",
    "soker & kashi ( 2013 ) suggested that the sn2009ip explosion was due to the merger of two stars , while some of the pre - explosion outbursts occurred near periastron passages of the binary system .",
    "another possible mechanism is the pulsational pair instability which in very massive stars can generate several explosions , expelling @xmath10m@xmath3 each , followed by the collapse of the stellar core ( rakavy , shaviv & zinamon 1967 ; woosley , blinnikov & heger 2007 ; waldman 2008 ) .",
    "measuring the mass - loss rates from massive stars prior to their explosion can be used as a tool to study the latest stages of stellar evolution , and to discriminate between the different models suggested to generate large mass - loss events .",
    "objects in which super - eddington outbursts were directly observed prior to the sn explosion provide a way to constrain the time at which mass - loss was taking place , and relate the optical luminosities with mass - loss rates and kinetic energy estimates . to date there are only three sne in which precursor outbursts were seen prior to the sn explosion .",

    "here we review several methods that we use to constrain the mass - loss rate from sn progenitors . in  [ sec : disc ] we implement these methods for the case of sn2009ip .",
    "we use several observables , including the bound - free absorption limit derived from the x - ray spectrum , the x - ray luminosity , upper limit on the diffusion time scale as derived from the sn rise time , the h@xmath0 luminosity , the non detection in radio bands , and the bolometric luminosity of the precursor observed prior to the sn explosion .",
    "our model assumes that the interaction of the sn blast wave with the csm produces x - ray and radio emission at the radius of the shock .",
    "the visible light photons may be produced below , or at , the shock radius .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission can be emitted either at the shock region , if it is due to collisional processes , or above the shock radius if it originates from optically thin csm ionized by the sn radiation field .",
    "all the photon diffusion and attenuation is taking place above the shock .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the csm around the progenitor has a spherical wind - density profile of the form @xmath83 , where @xmath76 is the distance from the progenitor , @xmath84 is the mass - loading parameter , @xmath85 is the mass - loss rate , and @xmath86 is the wind / outburst velocity . given the outbursts observed in sn2009ip prior to its final explosion , it is likely that the csm was  not ejected as a continuous wind with a uniform velocity",
    ". however , the mass - loss rate estimators we use below , are not very sensitive to this assumption .",
    "the reason for this is that , for a reasonable density distribution , the emission , or attenuation , are calculated by integrals which are dominated by the value at the shock radius . here",
    ", the only exception is the mass - loss estimator based on the h@xmath0 line luminosity ( see  [ sec : ha ] ) .",
    "therefore , we argue that the use of the continuous wind density profile provides an order of magnitude estimate for the mass - loss rate . in the following sections we discuss our specific mass - loss rate estimators and their caveats .      the particle density profile , in continuous wind , is given by ( e.g. , chevalier 1982 ) @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mass - loss rate in units of @xmath2m@xmath3yr@xmath4 , @xmath89 is the wind / outburst speed in units of 500kms@xmath4 , @xmath90 is the radius in units of @xmath91 cm , @xmath92 is the proton mass and @xmath93 is the mean number of nucleons per particle ( mean molecular weight ) . for our order - of - magnitude calculation , we adopt @xmath94 . in a wind profile ,",
    "the column density between radius @xmath76 and infinity is @xmath95 assuming that the gas in the pre - shocked wind is neutral and has solar abundance , the bound - free optical depth in the 0.0310kev region is roughly given by ( e.g. , behar et al .",
    "2011 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the bound - free cross section as a function of energy @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the energy in kev .",
    "this approximation is valid when the material is neutral .",
    "however , since above @xmath100kev , metals with a high ionization potential dominate the absorption , this formula is still valid , to an order of a magnitude , above 0.5kev when some of the inner electrons of the metals are bound ( i.e. , even if all the hydrogen is ionized ) .",
    "chevalier & irwin ( 2012 ) estimated that the metals will be completely ionized only above shock velocities of about @xmath82kms@xmath4 .      assuming the sn radiation field can ionize all the hydrogen in the csm , the mass of the hydrogen generating the h@xmath0 line is @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the planck constant",

    "an important caveat is that this estimate assumes that the line is generated by recombination .",
    "any h@xmath0 radiation generated in the shocked region due to collisional processes , is not included here . in order to avoid this problem",
    "we take as the line luminosity only the luminosity of the narrow line component , which we assume is due to wind above the shock region . in a wind profile ,",
    "the integrated mass from radius @xmath76 to @xmath109 is @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "we note that @xmath112 can not be arbitrarily large ( otherwise the mass in the csm will diverge ) , and here we will assume it is of order unity .    by substituting equation  [ eq : n ] into equation  [ eq : mh ] ( assuming @xmath113 ) and setting it equal to equation  [ eq : mr ] , we can get a relation between the mass - loading parameter @xmath114 , the h@xmath0 luminosity , and the radius ( ofek et al .",
    "2013b ) @xmath115 the reason for the inequality is that it is possible that not all of the hydrogen is ionized or that the temperature of the gas is higher than @xmath82k ( i.e. , @xmath116 depends on temperature ) , and that @xmath117 .",

    "another important caveat ( that can be expressed in terms of @xmath112 ) is that unlike the x - ray and radio emission which originate at the shock region ( radius @xmath76 ) , the narrow component of the h@xmath0 may originate at radii @xmath120 ( i.e. , above the shock region ) . in this case",

    "along with the observations , equations  [ n ] , [ eq : klr ] , [ lx ] , [ tdiff ] , [ tau_ff ] and [ ek ] provide order of magnitude lower and upper bounds on the mass - loss rate from the sn progenitor .",
    "it is important to note that the reason these are only order of magnitude estimates is because some of the assumptions that go into these formulae are likely inaccurate .",
    "for example , the assumption that the wind is infinite , continuous and can be described by a single velocity component , or the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , these relations provide order of magnitude , independent , estimators for the sn progenitor mass - loss rate .    .",
    "the solid black line shows the limit based on the x - ray luminosity ( equation  [ lx ] ) .",
    "the solid gray line represents the h@xmath0 luminosity derived limits ( equation  [ eq : klr ] ) .",
    "the black dashed line and the gray dashed line represent the column density ( equation  [ n ] ) and diffusion time scale ( equation  [ tdiff ] ) limits , respectively .",
    "the vertical thick gray solid line is based on the bolometric fluence ( equation  [ ek ] ) .",
    "finally , the free - free absorption limit ( equation  [ tau_ff ] ) is represented by the black dash - dotted line .",
    "the arrow attached to each line marks the direction of the region allowed by the line criteria .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines mark the 200 and 2000kms@xmath4 wind / outburst velocity which we derive from the , presumably pre explosion , ir spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spec_ha_paschenalpha ] ) .",
    "these lines constitute the approximate range of plausible wind / outburst velocities .",
    "since it is likely that the mass - loss was  not a continuous process with constant mass - loss rate , these measurements should be regarded as an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "see discussion in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "[ fig : mdotvw],width=321 ]    some of the estimators require knowledge regarding the shock radius @xmath76 .",
    "following chevalier ( 1982 ) , we use the approximation . note that chevalier ( 1982 ) denoted this variable by @xmath156 , while balberg & loeb ( 2010 ) use @xmath157 . ]",
    "@xmath158 where @xmath159 is the time , @xmath160 is the sn explosion time , and @xmath161 is the sn ejecta velocity ( @xmath162kms@xmath4 ) at @xmath163 ( @xmath164day ) , in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] we present the limits we derive on @xmath85 , as a function of the wind / outburst velocity . specifically , assuming @xmath165 , our x - ray observations of sn2009ip provide an upper limit of @xmath166@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , equtaion  [ n ] constitutes an upper limit on @xmath85 ( black dashed line ) . using equation  [ eq : klr ] , the h@xmath0 line luminosity of the _ narrow _ h@xmath0 component we measured on 2012 dec 4 , @xmath167ergs@xmath4 , and assuming @xmath168",
    ", we can set a lower limit on @xmath85 ( gray solid line ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : form ] , equation  [ lx ] , along with our measured x - ray luminosity of @xmath169ergs@xmath4 sets a lower limit on @xmath85 which is shown as the black solid line in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] .",
    "furthermore , the sn rise time of 2.3magday@xmath4 ( prieto et al .",
    "2012 ) implies @xmath170day . along with equation  [ tdiff ]",
    "these provide an upper limit on @xmath85 ( gray dashed line ) .",
    "the estimate based on the bolometric fluence ( equation  [ ek ] ) is shown as a vertical gray thick line .",
    "the non detection in radio ( chandra & soderberg 2012 ; hancock et al .",
    "2012 ) with equation  [ tau_ff ] set a lower limit on @xmath85 ( black dash - dotted line ) .",
    "on each line we mark also the @xmath171 used to calculate the line position . here",
    "we assume that @xmath160 is on 2012 sep 24 .",
    "although there is no single @xmath85 value which is consistent with all the bounds in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] , the closest values to all the bounds is in the range of about @xmath1 to @xmath2m@xmath3yr@xmath4 .",
    "kiewe et al . (",
    "2012 ) review the observed properties of 15 type - iin sne .",
    "they reported mass - loss rates , prior to explosion , in the range of @xmath172 to @xmath173m@xmath3yr@xmath4 , while their wind velocities are in the range of @xmath174 to 1600kms@xmath4 .",
    "the mass - loss rate and wind velocity of sn2009ip is consistent with these values .",
    "another sn which shows some similarities with sn2009ip is sn2010mc ( ptf10tel ; ofek et al .",
    "this sn showed an outburst about one month prior to its explosion .",
    "we note that the high state of sn2009ip just prior to its fast rise ( prieto et al .",
    "2012 ) can be interpreted as a similar outburst .",
    "type - iin sne are likely a non - homogeneous class of objects arising from multiple mechanisms .",
    "it is not clear what the best combination of parameters that will help us to relate a given type - iin to specific mechanism / progenitor are ( e.g. , luminous blue variable eruptions ) .",
    "however , better mass - loss rates and wind velocity measurements for larger samples of type - iin sn progenitors , as well as additional cases of pre - explosion outbursts can provide the missing link .      with the exception of the mass estimate based on the h@xmath0 luminosity",
    ", the mass - loss estimators in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] are consistent to an order of magnitude .",
    "specifically , the mass - loss lower limit based on the h@xmath0 luminosity , and assuming @xmath168 , is over an order of magnitude above the upper limit which is derived from the bound - free absorption column - density limit .",
    "we note that in the case of another source in which a similar analysis was applied ( sn2010mc / ptf10tel ; ofek 2012 ; ofek et al .",
    "2013b ) , the various estimators were consistent .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancy here is that some of our basic assumptions are incorrect . among these assumptions ,",
    "are uniformity of the csm , spherical symmetry , @xmath175 density profile , solar metallicity , and ionized ( but not fully ionized ) csm .",
    "alternatively , as we discussed in  [ sec : ha ] , it is possible that the h@xmath0 emitting region is further out , above the shock region ( e.g. , @xmath176 ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the h@xmath0 line luminosity probes a completely different regions of the csm , than the other methods discussed in  [ sec : form ] .",
    "interestingly , we note that in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] , solution allowed by all the mass - loss rate estimators which depend on the integral of density along the line of sight ( marked by non - solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotvw ] ) , infer low mass - loss rates , while estimators which measure the total emission from an optically thin volume ( marked by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotvw ] ) , give high values for the mass - loss rate .",
    "this behavior hints that another possible explanation for the discrepancy between the various lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotvw ] is that the csm has an aspherical geometry .",
    "there are two simple geometries that are roughly consistent with these results .",
    "the first simple explanation is that the csm around the sn has a disk geometry , and we observe the system from above or below the disk . in this case",
    "there will be a relatively small amount of intervening material between the observer and the source , hence small value of @xmath65 , and short @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , in this case the total emission ( @xmath133 and @xmath103 ) will be larger relative to the expectation based on the spherical geometry assumption and on the values of @xmath65 and @xmath140 .",
    "the second simple model is that the csm has a bipolar hourglass - like structure . in this case",
    "we observe the system from the equatorial plane .",
    "we note that there are likely other possible geometrical solutions , which are more complicated .",
    "we conclude that the best explanation for the discrepancy between the mass - loss estimators is that the h@xmath0 emission region is above the shock region ( or effectively @xmath176 ) , or alternatively that the csm is aspherical .",
    "unfortunately our order of magnitude analysis does  not provide a way to distinguish between the two scenarios .    if the h@xmath0 emission region is indeed located further out , relative to the shock",
    ", then an immediate conclusion is that an order of magnitude estimate to the mass - loss rate during the sn precursor is in the range of @xmath177m@xmath3yr@xmath4 to @xmath178m@xmath3yr@xmath4 .    in order to convert the mass - loss rate to an estimate of the total mass in the csm we need to integrate equation  [ eq : mr ] out to a specific radius .",
    "here we choose to integrate the total mass out to radius of @xmath7 cm .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the relatively abrupt disappearance of the x - ray flux @xmath179days after the explosion may indicate that the csm density is falling ( faster than a wind profile ) at a distance of @xmath7 cm ( see equation  [ r ] ) . using equation  [ eq : mr ]",
    "we find that the total csm mass out to this radius is @xmath180 here @xmath181 is the radius in units of @xmath7 cm .",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and mauerhan et al . (",
    "2012 ) suggested that the outbursts of sn2009ip are due to pulsational pair instability .",
    "however , woosley et al . ( 2007 ) predict that the mass - loss in pair instability mass ejections would be at least a few solar masses . unless the geometry is highly aspherical , this theoretically predicted mass - loss is high relative to our estimate of the total mass in the csm ( i.e. , @xmath182m@xmath3 ) .",
    "our mass - loss estimate is of the same order of magnitude as the one derived in ofek et al .",
    "( 2013b ) in context of the quataert & shiode ( 2012 ) mechanism .",
    "the estimators presented in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] are also in rough agreement with the shell mass of @xmath183m@xmath3 suggested by soker & kashi ( 2012 ) , in context of their binary - star merger scenario .",
    "interestingly , both levesque et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and soker & kashi ( 2012 ) suggested aspherical models for sn2009ip ( see also mauerhan et al .",
    "levesque et al . ( 2012 ) argued for a thin disk geometry , while soker & kashi ( 2012 ) suggested a bipolar hourglass - like geometry .",
    "however , soker & kashi ( 2012 ) suggested that we are observing the system along the polar direction .",
    "we note that if the discrepancy in figure  [ fig : mdotvw ] is due to asymmetry in the csm , rather than the radius at which the h@xmath0 line is generated , than the soker & kashi ( 2012 ) geometry is not consistent with our observations .",
    "however , we do  not claim that our suggested geometries are the only possible solutions .",
    "finally , we note that different mass - loss estimators have different functional dependencies on @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , additional observations ( e.g. , radio ) can constrain the density profile of the csm .",
