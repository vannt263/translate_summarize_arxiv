    "in recent years many experimental advances have been made in pairings of ultracold fermionic atoms , where the effective attractive interaction between the atoms can be tuned with the help of an applied magnetic field via a feshbach resonance @xcite . by tuning the fermion - fermion interaction it has been possible to experimentally realize the crossover between the weakly coupled bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid regime with the formation of cooper pairs of two fermionic atoms and the strong coupling regime where the pairs turn into difermion molecules in bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite . even though there is no phase transition but just a crossover between these two regimes , their features are very distinct . in the bcs side",
    "the coherence length of the pairs is much larger than the mean interparticle distance and as a consequence the fermionic degrees of freedom are still manifested .",
    "however , in the bec side , the strong interaction allows two fermions to bound into a bosonic molecule ; thus no fermionic degrees of freedom remain .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is not limited to cold fermionic atoms or to nonrelativistic systems .",
    "the main ingredients  a dilute gas of fermions with an attractive interaction that can favor the formation of cooper pairs on the fermi surface and a viable mechanism to produce the crossover  can be found in a wide range of cold and dense fermion systems .",
    "these conditions can be naturally satisfied inside the core of neutron stars , where temperatures are relatively low compared to densities which can reach values several times the normal nuclear density and hence allow deconfinement .",
    "the conditions for a bcs - bec crossover can also be expected to be met in the planned low - energy experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and future facilities all over the world , such as the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) @xcite , the nuclotron - based ion collider fcility ( nica ) , or the japn proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", interest has been spurred in investigating the realization of the bcs - bec crossover in various qcd - inspired models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a strong motivation for this activity is the need to explore the qcd - phase map at intermediate densities and low temperatures , a region of significant relevance for the physics of compact stars but inaccessible with lattice qcd due to the complex fermion determinant .",
    "the phase of qcd at asymptotically high baryonic densities is well established to be a color superconducting ( cs ) phase @xcite .",
    "this cs phase is the result of the attractive color force in the antitriplet channel for two quarks which favors the formation of cooper pairs on the fermi surface .",
    "however , as the density decreases , the quark - gluon interaction becomes stronger leading to a reduction of the coherence length of the diquark pairs .",
    "what happens at this point is still a matter of debate .",
    "some model calculations @xcite-@xcite suggest that the quark matter might go directly to a chirally broken hadronic phase via a strong first - order transition .",
    "another possibility is that the diquark pairs turn first into diquark molecules , thereby undergoing a bcs - bec crossover @xcite",
    ". eventually , the diquark pair may pick up yet another quark to form a color - singlet baryon .",
    "hence , the bcs - bec crossover could hold the key to our understanding of the transition from cs to hadronic matter . in 1999",
    "schafer and wilczek @xcite conjectured that the transition from cs to hadronic matter should be actually a crossover .",
    "the quark - hadron continuity has been studied in terms of the spectral continuity of nambu - goldstone modes @xcite and vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the role of diquarks in baryon formation and dissociation in cold dense quark / nuclear matter has been recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    up to now ,",
    "nevertheless , one ingredient has been left out in all the investigations of the cs - hadronic matter transition via a bcs - bec crossover : an external magnetic field . however , magnetic fields are endemic in neutron stars .",
    "pulsars magnetic fields range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 g @xcite , and for magnetars they can be as large as @xmath3 g @xcite on the surface and presumably much larger in the core .",
    "upper limit estimates for neutron star magnetic fields indicate that their magnitude can reach @xmath4 g @xcite-@xcite .",
    "very strong magnetic fields , @xmath5 g/@xmath6 g , are also generated in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these experiments produce a hot and low - density matter that is far from the qcd - phase region where the bcs - bec crossover is expected to occur . on the other hand ,",
    "as already mentioned , the future low - energy experiments at rhic , nica and fair @xcite-@xcite have been designed to probe the phase diagram of nuclear matter at intermediate - to - large baryon density and low temperature .",
    "these experiments are expected to produce also very strong magnetic fields @xcite , hence they will be relevant for understanding the field s influence on the cs - hadronic transition .    because of the astrophysical relevance , and also in preparation for those future experiments , it is important to have a good theoretical understanding of the magnetic field effects on the cs - hadronic matter crossover .",
    "the present paper is a first attempt in this direction .",
    "it is remarkable that the identification between the low - energy theories of the hadronic matter and the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) phase @xcite , which served as the base for the quark - hadronic matter continuity conjecture , was later found to exist too in an external magnetic field @xcite . in this case",
    "the identification was between the low - energy modes of the magnetic cfl ( mcfl ) phase @xcite and those of the hadronic matter in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we hope that the results of the present paper will shed some light on the quark - hadronic matter crossover in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ".    the most important outcome of this work is the discovery of a new mechanism by which a magnetic field can tune the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the mechanism is related to the filling ( emptying ) of new landau levels ( lls ) when the field is varied and to the relative numbers of occupied lls with either bec or bcs type of dispersion relations at a given magnetic field value .",
    "the filling ( emptying ) of new lls with varying field is also responsible for the de haas - van alphen oscillations of the gap @xcite-@xcite and number densities .",
    "no matter what the initial state of the system is at @xmath0 , for large enough magnetic fields the system will always reach a pure bcs regime .    even though our calculation is based on a simple model",
    ", it encompasses the properties of spin - zero cs that are essential for the new tuning mechanism to work , mainly that the pairing fermions carry opposite charges ( equivalent to the rotated charge in cfl and 2sc ) to ensure the coupling of these fermions with the external field , and the lack of a meissner effect . moreover , the field - induced tuning mechanism is model - independent .",
    "the crossover to the bcs regime at strong field strengths occurs because at those fields most of the fermions will lie in their lowest landau level ( lll ) and the dispersion relation of the lll quasiparticles in the paired system is always of bcs type .",
    "notice that this mechanism is different from the feshbach resonance that produces the crossover in cold atom systems @xcite by tuning the effective interaction between the fermions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and derive the gap and chemical equilibrium equations . in sec .",
    "iii we present our numerical results and discuss their meaning , as well as the physical origin of the crossover at large magnetic fields .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "to explore the effects of the magnetic field on the bcs - bec crossover , we will extend the model of fermions and scalar bosons interacting via a yukawa term considered in @xcite , to allow for two oppositely charged fermions @xmath7 that couple to an external , uniform and constant magnetic field b. the symmetry group of the model is @xmath8 , with subscripts `` b '' and `` em '' labeling the groups of baryonic and electromagnetic transformations respectively . the charged fermions in our model mimic the rotated charged quarks that pair to form neutral cooper pairs in the cfl and 2sc phases .",
    "the theory is described by the lagrangian density @xmath9 with    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    [ eq2 ]    here @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the fermion and boson masses respectively .",
    "the charge - conjugate fermions are described by @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and the electric charge @xmath17 and yukawa coupling @xmath18 operators are given in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the vector potential associated with the external magnetic field _",
    "b _ , which , without loss of generality , can be chosen along the @xmath21 axis .    the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) is invariant under the @xmath22 transformation @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "hence the bosons carry twice the baryon number of the fermions . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , chemical equilibrium with respect to the conversion of two fermions into one boson and vice versa is ensured by introducing fermion chemical potentials @xmath25 for fermions and @xmath26 for bosons .",
    "the transition can then be described from a weakly coupled and neutral cooper pair of two fermions with opposite electric charges into a molecular difermionic bound state , with an electrically neutral , strongly coupled , bosonlike behavior . in order to describe the bec of these molecules",
    ", we have to separate the zero mode of the boson field @xmath27 and replace it by its expectation value @xmath28 , which represents the electrically neutral difermion condensate .",
    "the mean - field effective action is then @xmath29 where the fermion inverse propagators of the nambu - gorkov positive and negative charged fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by @xmath32^{-1 } & i\\gamma^{5}\\delta^{*}\\\\ i\\gamma^{5}\\delta & [ g_{(\\pm)0}^{-}]^{-1}\\end{array}\\right)\\ , \\label{inv - propg}\\ ] ] with @xmath33^{-1}(x , y)=[i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\pi_{\\mu}^{(\\pm)}-m\\pm\\mu\\gamma^{0}]\\delta^{4}(x - y)\\ , \\label{b - x - inv - prop}\\ ] ] and @xmath34 .",

    "the bose condensate @xmath37 is related to the difermion condensate through @xmath38 .",
    "the zero temperature effective potential obtained from ( [ b - action ] ) becomes , after using ritus s transformation to momentum space @xcite ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40 denotes the spin degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "the energy dispersions for fermions and bosons are    @xmath41    and @xmath42 respectively .",

    "the transverse component of the momentum is quantized ( landau levels ) , so the 4-momentum of the fermion in the chosen gauge is given by @xmath46 and the energy depends only on the longitudinal component @xmath47 ( for a field parallel to @xmath21 ) and the landau level @xmath43 .    to investigate the crossover we first need to find the gap and chemical potential that simultaneously solve the gap equation and the condition of chemical equilibrium at fixed parameters , and then use them to obtain the density fractions of fermions and bosons as functions of the field .",
    "chemical equilibrium requires @xmath48 where @xmath49 plays the role of a fixed total baryon number density , @xmath50 , and the fermion number density @xmath51 and condensate density @xmath52 , are respectively given by @xmath53    the gap equation is given by @xmath54 , which can be obtained from ( [ eff - pot ] ) as @xmath55 as discussed in @xcite , the crossover parameter in the present case can be defined by @xmath56 , which is linked to the renormalized boson mass @xmath57 in vacuum @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 can then be changed by hand to mimic the effect of a change in the coupling .",
    "since the momentum integral and the summation over fermion landau levels are divergent , we introduce a gaussian regulator @xmath60 $ ] with momentum cutoff @xmath61 gev . following the derivations of @xcite",
    ", one can see that at zero magnetic field the parameters of the theory @xmath62 , @xmath49 , @xmath13 , and @xmath57 can be always chosen to have @xmath63 coinciding with the situation where the density fractions of fermions @xmath64 , and bosons @xmath65 are all equal to @xmath66 . with such a choice , and according to the criterion used in @xcite , negative values of @xmath59 with large moduli",
    "describe a pure bcs state , large positive values of @xmath59 describe a pure bec phase , and @xmath67 plays the role of the scattering length .",
    "the selection of the model parameters can be done at any given magnetic field value , to have @xmath63 corresponding to the unitarity limit , at which the scattering length becomes infinite . in this work , however , we are more interested in exploring the situation where we keep fixed values of the parameters , and instead change the strength of the magnetic field to see if it can have any effect in the bcs - bec crossover",
    ". henceforth we will use @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 in all the calculations .",

    "the upper panel in fig.[fractionsversusmb ] shows the variations of the chemical potential and gap solutions with the boson mass at different field values . even though at zero and nonzero magnetic fields the chemical potential increases and the gap decreases with @xmath73 , a large magnetic field yields slightly smaller gap values for the same @xmath73 in the large @xmath73 region . for the three field strengths , the system is in a bec state at @xmath74 gev in the left end region of the middle panel graph , where the bec - like pairing dominates over the bcs - like one , as reflected in the density fractions , large @xmath75 and small @xmath76 .",
    "when @xmath14 increases , the fermion number fraction becomes larger and finally dominates at the right end indicating a bcs regime .",

    "figure [ effective - mass123 ] shows the consistency of the above interpretation . in this figure we plotted the chemical potential @xmath25 and the effective mass @xmath106 of a few lls as functions of the magnetic field when the system starts at zero field in the bec regime ( upper panel ) , or in the bcs one ( lower panel ) . at low fields ,",

    "this means that the higher levels shown in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ dispersion - relation ] are likely not contributing already at those strong fields .",
    "in this paper we investigated the effect of a magnetic field in the relativistic bcs - bec crossover in the context of a model with neutral bosons and charged fermions minimally coupled to a magnetic field .",
    "the simple model used in our calculations resembles some basic properties of spin - zero color superconducting phases in a magnetic field like for instance the mcfl phase @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that a magnetic field can tune the bcs - bec crossover via a novel mechanism according to which the state of the system at each field is determined by the number of occupied lls with either positive or negative effective chemical potential @xmath98 . if the majority of the lls have @xmath116 , the system is in a bec state , because a majority of bec - type modes prevails .",
    "on the contrary , if the majority of the lls have @xmath115 , it is in the bcs regime . at strong enough fields",
    ", the system goes to the bcs regime , because in this case only the lll , whose dispersion is always of bcs type , is occupied .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover has been studied in the literature using two types of models : single - channel models and two - channel models . in two - channel models , like the one used in this paper , fermion and boson degrees of freedom",
    "are introduced from the beginning in the lagrangian . in single - channel models",
    "one starts with a lagrangian that only has fermionic degrees of freedom , like in a nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "then , the bosonic degrees of freedom are introduced with the help of a bosonization procedure as the hubbard - stratonovich transformation . a natural continuation of the present work will be to investigate the magnetic field effect on the crossover in the context of a single - channel theory . given that the dispersions of the charged fermions in the presence of a magnetic field will be of the same form in a purely fermionic theory in the presence of a magnetic field , one can still use the sign of the effective chemical potential @xmath114 and the relative numbers of lls with each sign as valid criteria to control the crossover .",
    "there are different njl theories that could be used as single - channel models",
    ". one interesting possibility would be to consider the field effects in a njl model with both diquark and chiral condensates that can interact via the axial anomaly , such as the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we could then explore how the field - induced crossover mechanism found in our two - channel model turns out to be in this case , where the mass of the charged fermions is not necessarily constant , but can itself be affected by the field in any region where the diquark and chiral condensates coexist .",
    "apart from the obvious fundamental motivation of understanding the effects of a magnetic field in the bcs - bec crossover within a more realistic model , if the relativistic bcs - bec theories discussed in the literature have any relevance for the physics of neutron stars and the future low - energy , heavy - ion collision experiments , it makes sense to consider them with a magnetic field , as extremely strong magnetic fields are expected to be present in these two settings .",
    "therefore , an imperative next step will be to consider more realistic models of color superconducting quark matter to explore all the implications of a magnetic field in the bcs - bec crossover .",

    "<S> the effect of an applied magnetic field in the crossover from bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing regimes is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we use a model of relativistic fermions and bosons inspired by those previously used in the context of cold fermionic atoms and in the magnetic - color - flavor - locking phase of color superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that as with cold atom systems , an applied magnetic field can also tune the bcs - bec crossover in the relativistic case . </S>",
    "<S> we find that no matter what the initial state is at @xmath0 , for large enough magnetic fields the system always settles into a pure bcs regime . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the atomic case , the magnetic field tuning of the crossover in the relativistic system is not connected to a feshbach resonance , but to the relative numbers of landau levels with either bec or bcs type of dispersion relations that are occupied at each magnetic field strength . </S>"
