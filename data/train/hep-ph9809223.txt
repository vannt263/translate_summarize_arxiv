    "the minimal supergravity model ( msugra )  @xcite provides a well - motivated and economical realization the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite , or mssm . in msugra , supersymmetry is broken in the `` hidden sector '' which consists of fields which couple to the fields of the mssm only gravitationally .",
    "thus , susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector mssm fields via interactions of gravitational strength .",
    "the technical assumption of minimality implies that kinetic terms for matter fields take the canonical form ; this assumption , which is equivalent to assuming an approximate global @xmath11 symmetry between @xmath12 chiral multiplets , leads to a common mass squared @xmath13 ( defined at a high scale @xmath14 ) for all scalar fields , and a common trilinear scalar coupling @xmath15 for all @xmath16 parameters .",
    "these parameters , which determine the sparticle - particle mass splitting in the observable sector , are taken to be of similar magnitude as the weak scale , @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , motivated by the apparently successful gauge coupling unification in the mssm , one usually adopts a common value @xmath18 for all gaugino masses at the scale @xmath19 gev . for simplicity",
    ", it is commonly assumed that in fact the scalar masses and trilinear terms unify at @xmath20 as well .",
    "the resulting effective theory , valid at energy scales @xmath21 , is then just the mssm with the usual soft susy breaking terms unified at @xmath20 . the soft susy breaking scalar and gaugino mases , the trilinear @xmath16 terms and in addition a bilinear soft term @xmath22 , the gauge and yukawa couplings and the supersymmetric @xmath23 term are all then evolved from @xmath20 to some scale @xmath24 using renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "the large top quark yukawa coupling causes the squared mass parameter of one of the higgs fields @xmath25 to be reduced . for",
    "phenomenologically viable choices of parameters , @xmath26 becomes negative so that electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , and @xmath27 can be determined in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "it is customary to trade the parameter @xmath22 for @xmath0 , the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values .",
    "finally , it is assumed that superpotential interactions conserve @xmath29-parity .",
    "the resulting weak scale spectrum of superpartners and their couplings can thus be derived in terms of four continuous plus one discrete parameters @xmath30 in addition to the usual parameters of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the implications of the msugra model for supersymmetry searches at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have been examined by several groups in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the reach of the lhc for susy via a variety of search channels has been obtained . in channels with jets plus missing transverse momentum @xmath31 plus 0 - 3 isolated leptons , values of @xmath32 gev",
    "could be probed with just 10 fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this compares well with the reach obtained cms and atlas studies @xcite using somewhat different strategies to isolate the signal .",
    "in addition , for part of this parameter space , a characteristic edge  @xcite in the dilepton mass spectrum gave precision information on the mass difference @xmath10 .",
    "this measurement could be used as a starting point in various `` case studies '' to ultimately reconstruct many of the sparticle masses in cascade decay chains@xcite .",
    "these studies , using the event generator isajet@xcite , were at the time limited to low values of the parameter @xmath33 .    for higher values of the parameter @xmath0 , the @xmath2-quark and @xmath1-lepton yukawa couplings can become large .",
    "this can affect susy phenomenology in several ways .    *",
    "large @xmath2 and @xmath1 yukawa couplings cause the @xmath34 and @xmath35 soft susy breaking masses to run to weak scale values that are lower than the corresponding mass terms for first and second generation squarks and sleptons . also , for large values of @xmath0 , there can be large off - diagonal mixing in sbottom and stau mass matrices . together , these effects can make the physical stau and sbottom mass eigenvalues significantly lower than their first and second generation squark and slepton counterparts @xcite .",
    "* contributions to the rge proportional to the squared @xmath2 and @xmath1 yukawa couplings reduce the mass of the @xmath36odd higgs boson @xmath37 , which in turn reduces the masses of the @xmath36even higgs boson @xmath38 and of the charged higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath39 is often determined by the experimental lower bound on @xmath37 .",
    "* the relatively lower stau and sbottom masses result in larger production cross sections for third generation susy particles compared to first and second generation susy particles .",
    "* the large @xmath1 and @xmath2 yukawa couplings , along with relatively light values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 masses can yield enhanced decays of gluinos to @xmath2-quarks @xcite and of charginos and neutralinos to @xmath1 leptons and @xmath2 quarks @xcite .    as a result , for large values of @xmath0",
    ", we expect susy events to contain many more @xmath2-quarks and @xmath1-leptons than anticipated in earlier studies that were mostly carried out for relatively low values of @xmath0 .",
    "recently , a number of improvements @xcite have been made to the event generator isajet @xcite to allow realistic event generation in supersymmetric models even if @xmath0 is large .",
    "the consequences of the msugra model at large @xmath0 for the fermilab tevatron collider have been examined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this study",
    ", it was found that for large @xmath0 , significantly fewer hard isolated @xmath42 s and @xmath23 s are produced in susy events , so that the reach for susy in various isolated lepton channels is greatly _ reduced _ compared to the corresponding reach at low @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , much of the reach of the fermilab main injector ( and possible luminosity upgrades thereof ) comes from @xmath43 production @xcite , where @xmath44 or @xmath23 , if @xmath0 is small .",
    "however , for high @xmath0 values , decays such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 can become dominant so that far fewer hard isolated leptons are produced , and the reach for susy is considerably diminished .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that for @xmath6 , there would be _ no reach _ of the fermilab tevatron main injector ( @xmath47 fb@xmath5 ) for msugra beyond the current existing bounds from lep2 experiments .",
    "more recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that some reach might be recovered in the three lepton channel if one can use leptons with @xmath48 as small as 5  gev .",
    "potentially worrisome physics backgrounds from heavy flavor production ( which are very effectively reduced with harder lepton cuts ) , as well as instrumental backgrounds from lepton mis - identification are thought to be under control @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is then natural to ask if the cern lhc reach for msugra at large @xmath0 is also diminished , and if in fact susy could hide from lhc searches if the parameter @xmath0 happens to be large .",
    "we have several goals for this paper .    1 .",
    "we wish to establish the range of parameter space of the msugra model that can be probed by cern lhc experiments .",
    "in particular , is the reach of the lhc sufficient to discover or rule our msugra at large @xmath0 , or could msugra effectively hide from susy searches ?",
    "this issue is addressed in sec .",
    "if a susy signal can be established at large @xmath0 , is it still possible for lhc experiments to make precision measurements of ( differences of ) sparticle masses and model parameters ? in sec .  3",
    ", we perform a case study for the parameter space point ( @xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 decay almost exclusively to @xmath1 leptons , to answer this question . for this case",
    ", we find that an edge is reconstructable in the @xmath52 invariant mass distribution which gives information on @xmath10 .",
    "combining the @xmath1 s with jets to form an invariant mass can also give an estimate of the mass of any squarks produced in susy events .",
    "3 .   in sec .  4 , we examine the extent to which the @xmath1 lepton multiplicity exceeds the electron multiplicity in susy events if @xmath0 is large . we discuss various complications for such a measurement , and point out that @xmath1 signals could provide a novel diagnostic for susy analysis , and that these signals could provide an alternative handle on the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "we end with a summary of our results and some general remarks in sec .",
    "we evaluate the msugra signal using the isajet 7.37 event generator program , which is described in more detail in ref .",
    "we use the same toy detector simulation as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath53  tev ,",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 production are the dominant sources of susy events at the lhc .",
    "these production mechanisms , together with @xmath57 and @xmath58 cascade decays , naturally lead to events with @xmath12-leptons @xmath59-jets @xmath60 , where typically @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in our simulation , we generate all susy processes using isajet . however , our cuts are designed to selectively pick out gluino and squark events , whose characteristics are high transverse momentum jets and large missing transverse energy . furthermore , the @xmath48 of the primary jets from gluinos as well as the @xmath31 are expected to scale with @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast , the momenta of leptons , produced far down in the cascade decay chain from chargino and neutralino daughters , will in general be much softer than the jets and @xmath31 , which can be produced in the first step of the cascade decay .",
    "thus , following refs .",
    "@xcite for the multilepton plus multijet signals for susy , we vary the missing - energy and jet @xmath64 cuts using a parameter @xmath65 but fix the lepton cuts :    * jet multiplicity , @xmath66 ( with @xmath67  gev ) , * transverse sphericity @xmath68 , * @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we classify the events by the multiplicity of _ isolated _ leptons , and in the case of dilepton events , we also distinguish between the opposite sign ( os ) and same sign ( ss ) samples as these could have substantially different origins . for the leptons we require ,    * @xmath71  gev ( @xmath72 or @xmath23 ) and @xmath73  gev for the @xmath74 signal , and * @xmath75  gev for @xmath76 lepton signals .",

    "we take @xmath93 gev . the bricked regions are excluded by lack of appropriate radiative electroweak symmmetry breaking , or ( for @xmath94 ) if the lightest neutralino @xmath95 is not the lightest susy particle ( the lsp ) .",
    "the shaded region is excluded by experimental searches for supersymmetry , and mainly corresponds to the lep2 bound @xmath96 gev , or the susy translation of the lep2 bound that @xmath97 gev for a sm higgs boson .",
    "mass contours for a 1000 gev gluino and 1000 gev first generation squark are shown to orient the reader .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]_a _ for @xmath90 are updated versions of similar results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are useful for comparison with the higher @xmath0 cases shown in frames _ b _ ) , _ c _ ) and _ d _ ) .",
    "the largest reach is generally obtained in the single isolated lepton plus jets plus @xmath31 channel ( labelled @xmath74 ) or in the jets plus @xmath31 channel with no isolated leptons ( labelled @xmath31 ) . for 10 fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity , values of @xmath98 gev ( 1600 gev )",

    "contours for jets plus @xmath31 plus two opposite sign isolated leptons ( labelled os ) , or two same sign leptons ( labelled ss ) or three isolated leptons ( labelled @xmath100 ) are also shown .",
    "each of these multilepton channels also gives a significant reach for msugra , so that for much of the parameter space shown , a susy signal ought to be visible in several different channels .    in the case of reach projections for the fermilab tevatron , as @xmath0 increased , it became more difficult to obtain high @xmath48 isolated leptons since chargino and neutralino branchings to @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s increased at the expense of @xmath42 s and @xmath23 s .",
    "consequently , as @xmath0 increased , the fermilab tevatron reach for msugra decreased , and in fact for @xmath6 , there was _ no reach _ for tevatron run 2 ( 2 fb@xmath5 ) beyond the region already excluded by lep2@xcite .",
    "as mentioned , if it is possible to use softer cuts on the leptons , the situation might be somewhat ameliorated @xcite .",
    "the corresponding situation for the cern lhc is shown in frames _ b _ ) , _ c _ ) and _ d _ ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for large @xmath0",
    ", we see first of all that the theoretically excluded region increases substantially at large @xmath99 .",
    "this region actually depends somewhat sensitively on the assumed value of the top mass ( and on which higher order corrections are included in the program used ) .",
    "this excluded region also increases at low @xmath99 and large @xmath18 when @xmath101 becomes lighter than @xmath102 .",
    "next , as @xmath0 increases from 2 to 20 , 35 and 45 , we see that the ultimate reach for msugra only decreases slightly in the @xmath74 and @xmath31 channels , and only for low values of @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath99 is large , for @xmath18 close to the lhc reach in frame _ a _ ) , charginos and neutralinos mainly decay to real @xmath78 , @xmath79 and higgs bosons , and leptonic signals from these decays , and hence the lhc reach , are only weakly dependent on @xmath0 . for low values of @xmath99",
    ", however , the decays @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( bars are omitted ) , and possibly , those to other sleptons are also kinematically accessible .",
    "the decays to stau dominate for high values of @xmath0 , while for low @xmath0 and low @xmath99 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 and @xmath107 or @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "it is easier to get hard isolated leptons from the subsequent @xmath78 or @xmath110 decays than from a @xmath111 decay , which accounts for the somewhat higher reach in the @xmath74 channel at low @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the reach for msugra in the multilepton channels decreases as @xmath0 increases , but again only for low @xmath99 .",
    "although the lhc reach for msugra is somewhat reduced at large @xmath0 , the contours still lie far beyond parameter space preference curves due to `` naturalness '' considerations@xcite , which tend to lie below the @xmath112 gev contours .",
    "it is worth noting that the selection criteria designed to extract the susy signal for the low @xmath0 regime suffice even if @xmath0 is large ; _",
    "i.e. _ no new analysis is necessary .",
    "the large reach for msugra at large @xmath0 is due in part to the large squark and gluino production cross sections , and the fact that for very large sparticle masses , leptons occuring very far down the cascade decay chain can still have substantial @xmath48 . from these reach contours , we conclude that it would be difficult for msugra to hide from detection at the lhc by virtue of having a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the corresponding situation for the fermilab tevatron @xmath113 collider @xcite .",
    "in refs .  @xcite , five msugra parameter space points were adopted for detailed case studies .",
    "it was found that in fact precision measurements of ( differences of ) susy particle masses and model parameters could in many instances be made at lhc experiments .",
    "we briefly summarize the results of refs .",
    "@xcite as follows .",
    "* a global variable @xmath114 ( scalar sum ) for events with @xmath115 was defined .",
    "distributions in @xmath116 were shown to be dominated at low values by sm backgrounds , but were dominated by the msugra signal at high values of @xmath116 .",
    "the peak in the @xmath116 distribution scaled with @xmath117 and provided a good first estimate of the strongly interacting susy particle masses involved in the signal events . *",
    "gluino and squark cascade decay events involving @xmath51 were found to be very useful for reconstructing the cascade decay chain whenever the branching fraction for the decay @xmath118 or the decay @xmath119 is substantial . in the case that @xmath118 followed by @xmath120 , the @xmath121 mass could be reconstructed to yield @xmath122 ; then by combining with other hard jets present in the events , mass estimates could be made of other susy particles occurring earlier in the cascade decay sequence . in the @xmath119 case , the endpoint of the @xmath123 distribution leads to a precise determination of @xmath10 ( or if the decay is mediated by an on - shell slepton , yields information about @xmath124 ) ; again , by combining dilepton masses with various jets , other sparticle mass estimates could be obtained .",
    "these reconstructed decay chains thus yield information of several sparticle masses which can then be used to constrain the underlying model parameters . *",
    "finally , a global fit of event characteristics and/or mass measurements to various susy model parameters could be made .",
    "an overconstrained fit allowed rejection of many possible susy models , while honing in on possible choices for underlying model parameters .",
    "the msugra parameter space choices made in ref .",
    "@xcite were necessarily restricted to values of @xmath125 , since isajet was at the time only valid for that parameter space regime .",
    "we expect that the @xmath116 distribution will continue to yield a measure of the susy mass scale regardless of the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "however , any sparticle mass reconstruction strategies involving @xmath51 decays are in need of re - analysis since at large @xmath0 , @xmath126 can be the dominant decay mode of @xmath51 .",
    "for this reason , we select an additional case study point , `` lhc point 6 '' , with msugra parameter values @xmath127 , as suggested in @xcite , where mass parameters are in units of gev . in this case , @xmath128 gev , @xmath129 gev , @xmath130 gev , @xmath131 gev , @xmath132 gev , @xmath133 gev and @xmath134 gev . in this case , @xmath103 at 99.8% and @xmath8 at 99.6% .",
    "in addition , @xmath135 occurs at 55% .",
    "the susy signal events in this case are expected to be rich in @xmath2-jets and @xmath1-leptons .",
    "a signal sample of 500 k events ( corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 5  fb@xmath5 ) was generated , along with 250 k event background samples each for @xmath136jets , @xmath137jets , @xmath77 production as in ref .",
    "qcd backgrounds are expected to be small after basic selection cuts discussed below .",
    "hadronic @xmath1 s were found using generator information rather than selecting narrow jets .",
    "in addition , hadronic @xmath1 s were required to have visible @xmath138 gev and @xmath139 .",
    "we used the cdf rate for jets to fake @xmath1 s , namely , 0.5% at @xmath140 gev and 0.1% for @xmath141 gev , with a linear interpolation in between@xcite .",

    "the rate is very much larger than the sm background shown as the hatched histogram , so observing a signal in this distribution would be trivial .",

    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the subtracted distribution , shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] , has a clear low mass enhancement with an endpoint near but slightly below the limit for two body decays neglecting the @xmath1 mass : @xmath157 the contribution to this distribution of events with exactly one @xmath51 and no @xmath50 is shown as the dashed curve in the figure and clearly accounts for most of the low mass enhancement .",
    "there is also a contribution from events containing at least one @xmath158 or @xmath159 , the dash - dot curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which accounts for the excess of @xmath52 pairs at higher mass .",
    "many channels contribute to these decays ; the branching ratio for @xmath160 is only 8.8% , so the distribution appears to end before the kinematic limit , @xmath161 thus , from these distributions , it should be possible to extract information not only on @xmath10 , but perhaps also information on heavier neutralino masses as well , although this will probably be very difficult .",
    "we should point out that while focussing on taus with three charged prong decays indeed gives us a truer di - tau mass distribution , it also leads to a reduction in event rate by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we have not attempted to examine whether the end point is better determined from this `` truer '' distribution or from the kink in the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which includes an order of magnitude larger data sample .",
    "our study here should be regarded as a first look at the sort of measurements that might be possible when charginos and neutralinos dominantly decay to taus .",
    "most of the @xmath51 s originate from squark cascade decays in this case study .",
    "it is then interesting to see if an estimate can be made of the squark masses as well as the neutralino masses . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have required events with exactly two @xmath1 s , each decaying into three prongs , and then have constructed the invariant mass of the @xmath1-pair with each of the two fastest jets ; finally , we plot the minimum of these two masses .",
    "since the hardest jets typically come from @xmath162 decay , this distribution should be approximately bounded by the squark mass .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the bulk of the @xmath163 distribution is in fact bounded by @xmath164 gev .",
    "a similar calculation can be performed using only identified @xmath2-jets , to try to extract the @xmath165 mass from @xmath166 decays . in fig .",

    "the bulk of the distribution is bounded by @xmath130  gev , although a tail extends to higher mass values .",
    "this is due in part to contributions from @xmath168 decays , where @xmath169  gev",
    ". it might also be interesting to see whether it is similarly possible to isolate the decay chain @xmath170 by looking at the @xmath171 which should be bounded by @xmath63 .",
    "over a significant portion of msugra parameter space it is expected that the multiplicity of @xmath1 leptons should be enhanced relative to @xmath42s or @xmath23s at large @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that if it is possible to conclusively establish tau lepton non - universality in susy events , we may be able to interprete it as an indicator of a sizeable tau yukawa interaction , at least within the msugra framework .",
    "it should , of course , be kept in mind that within the more general mssm framework , susy events may exhibit lepton non - universality even if yukawa couplings are negligible , as long as @xmath101 differs from selectron and smuon masses .",
    "the observation of universality between @xmath42 and @xmath23 in a susy event sample would strongly tempt us to suggest@xcite that an observed tau non - universality indeed originates in a sizeable tau yukawa coupling .    while the principle is simple",
    ", its implementation poses a challenge . even in a sample of purely sm events",
    ", there should be a superficial non - universality of @xmath172 simply due to the different acceptance cuts and efficiencies for identifying each species of lepton .",
    "it should be possible to determine these directly from a data sample rich in sm events .",
    "however , these efficiencies will also change somewhat with the cuts used to select out susy events , but this can presumably be taken into account , again using the data ; _",
    "e.g. _ by using selection cuts that smoothly interpolate between sm and signal samples . hadronically decaying taus",
    "pose yet another challenge since the visible energy spectrum in their decays , and hence , the tau detection efficency , is sensitive to their polarization  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a data sample enriched in new physics ( in our case susy ) events , the tau polarization is not known _ a priori _ , but may be possible to determine from the data .",
    "a complete quantitative analysis of lepton non - universality is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "for one , it would entail a correct simulation of tau decays ( including effects of tau polarization ) both for sm backgrounds and the susy sample .",
    "these effects are not yet completely included in isajet .",
    "our study should , therefore , be regarded as exploratory , and simply indicative of the magnitude of asymmetries that we will have at our disposal for future studies .    to illustrate this with a direct computation , we examine three different msugra parameter space points with @xmath173 gev , @xmath174 gev , @xmath175 , @xmath89 and _ a _ ) @xmath90 , _ b _ ) @xmath92 and _ c _ ) @xmath6 , along with the sm background .",
    "we impose a simple set of cuts :    * we require 2 jets each with @xmath176 and @xmath177 , * we require transverse sphericity @xmath145 , * for events with a single isolated lepton , we require @xmath178 gev ( @xmath179 or @xmath1 ) , where in the case of @xmath1 we use the visible @xmath1 energy to construct @xmath180 .    we show the total signal and background as a function of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ nonu]_a_. for low values of @xmath65 , the resulting event sample is background dominated , while for high @xmath65 , the sample is signal dominated . in fig .",
    "[ nonu]_b _ , we plot the average lepton multiplicity in the surviving signal plus background event sample of @xmath42 s and @xmath1 s , denoted by @xmath181 ( dashed ) and @xmath182 ( solid ) . for case a , with low @xmath90 ,",
    "the @xmath1 multiplicity is roughly constant versus @xmath65 , and would correspond to a measured lepton universality after accounting for acceptances and efficiencies . for this case , the quantity @xmath183 decreases somewhat with @xmath65 since jetty gluino and squark cascade decay events are more likely to pass our simple cuts listed above . for case b with @xmath92 , @xmath107 with a branching fraction of 98% while @xmath184 27% of the time , so that some violation of universality is expected .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ nonu]_b _ where the @xmath42 and @xmath1 multiplicity is nearly that of case a for low @xmath65 , while for high @xmath65 , which is signal dominated , there is a distinct increase in @xmath1 multiplicity compared to @xmath42 multiplicity .",
    "this can be seen more easily in fig .",
    "[ nonu]_c _ where we plot the ratio @xmath185 versus @xmath65 .",
    "for case c , we have @xmath186 = 93% and @xmath187 = 99% , so large deviations from universality should be expected at high @xmath65 . for this case , we see in fig .",
    "[ nonu]_b _ that in fact @xmath188 surpasses @xmath189 for all @xmath190 gev , and fig .",
    "[ nonu]_c _ shows the huge deviations from universality that would be expected for very large @xmath0 and small @xmath99 .    while we recognize that our results should be regarded as qualitative , we are encouraged to see that the magnitudes of asymmetries in the three cases are quite different . as more complete simulations become available , it would be instructive to study the extent to which @xmath1 leptons may serve as a diagnostic of any new physics that might be discovered .",
    "such analyses will have to be interpreted with care since , as we have said , the tau detection efficiency , and hence the expectation for tau multiplicity , depends on the unknown polarization ( which may be possible to measure ) in the new physics sample .",
    "well - defined frameworks such as msugra would , however , make unambiguous predictions for @xmath188 , so that this measurement could serve as an independent test , and possibly even provide a measure of @xmath0 ( especially if it happens to be large ) . indeed in the future , it may prove worthwhile to examine the multiplicity of taus separately in various event toplogy samples ( @xmath191 _ etc .",
    "_ ) since these generally have different susy origins .",
    "in this paper we have studied susy signals at the cern lhc collider as predicted by the minimal supergravity model for large values of the parameter @xmath0 . we found that increasing this parameter to values near its upper bound has little impact on the susy discovery reach of the lhc , in stark contrast to the tevatron ,",
    "whose reach is greatly diminished in this region of parameter space .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that increasing @xmath0 can change the qualitative pattern of neutralino and chargino decays only for relatively small sparticle masses , where their decays into real @xmath78 and @xmath79 bosons are kinematically disallowed .",
    "even though in this region of parameter space the efficiency for detecting susy through events containing hard leptons is low also at the lhc , the huge event rate guarantees that susy will still be seen in several different channels .",
    "once decays into real gauge or higgs bosons become possible , decay patterns become less sensitive to @xmath0 ; in particular , except when @xmath99 is very small , many hard leptons now come from the decay of on  shell @xmath78 and @xmath79 bosons , independent of the value of @xmath0 .    apart from discovering susy",
    ", one would also like to determine its parameters , so as to eventually pin down the supersymmetric model that describes nature at a more fundamental level .",
    "most previous studies that attempted to reconstruct some ( differences of ) susy masses at the lhc used events with hard isolated leptons .",
    "unfortunately , for large values of @xmath0 and not too heavy sparticles susy events are expected to contain @xmath1 leptons rather than electrons or muons .",
    "while leptonically decaying @xmath1 s still produce sufficiently many hard electrons and muons to ensure that susy will be discovered , the presence of many additional neutrinos would make mass reconstruction using electrons and muons all but impossible in this part of parameter space . in sec .",
    "3 we instead used hadronic 3prong decays of @xmath1 s to determine the difference between the masses of the lightest and next  to  lightest neutralino ; we focussed on this decay mode since here the simultaneously produced @xmath192s ( which smear out the end point ) are forced to be relatively soft , which minimizes their impact on kinematic event reconstruction .",
    "while the precision of this measurement will be worse than that of the analogous measurement based on @xmath193 pairs at smaller @xmath0 , it should still be sufficient to greatly constrain the susy model .",
    "we also showed how combining @xmath1 pairs with a hard jet might yield information about the overall scale of the squark masses or , if this jet contains a tagged @xmath2 , the mass of bottom squarks .",
    "finally , the presence of many @xmath1 leptons also offers new opportunities to glean information about the underlying susy parameters . as a first attempt in that direction we studied in sec .  4 the violation of lepton universality that can be expected in susy events if @xmath0 is large .",
    "in order to make this fully quantitative , a careful analysis of the different detection efficiencies for the three flavors of leptons is mandatory , which requires detailed understanding about the performance of lhc detectors as well as detailed simulation of @xmath1 decays .",
    "here we instead simply showed corresponding results for event samples dominated by standard model contributions , where lepton universality is known to hold to very good approximation ; this serves as a normalization for other event samples dominated by susy contributions .",
    "some caution is advised when interpreting these results .",
    "for example , the average @xmath1 polarization is expected to change when going from the sm  dominated sample to the susy  dominated sample ; this will change the @xmath64 spectrum of the visible @xmath1 decay products , and hence their detection efficiency .",
    "however , our results clearly show that at least for the extreme case where @xmath50 and @xmath51 almost exclusively decay into real @xmath194 sleptons , a gross violation of lepton universality should be expected .",
    "one can envision other , more ambitious studies of susy events containing hadronically decaying @xmath1 leptons .",
    "for example , a comparison of the visible spectra of events with 1prong and 3prong @xmath1 decays should allow to determine the @xmath1 polarization , which in turn would yield information on the @xmath195 mixing angle , as well as the decomposition of the @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 mass eigenstates in terms of gaugino and higgsino current states . copious production of @xmath1 leptons , a bane for susy searches at the tevatron , could therefore well turn out to be a boon for the lhc .",
