    "the ideal hydrodynamical description for the dynamics of hot and dense matter achieved in rhic experiments works amazingly well , particularly for the behavior of collective flow parameters .",
    "together with other signals , the success of the approach is considered as the indication of the emergence of a new state of strongly interacting matter , the plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) .",
    "the comparison between rhic and sps results shows that this new state of matter is formed at the very early stage of the relativistic heavy ion collisions for rhic energies .",
    "the nature of the qgp seems rather a strongly interacting fluid ( sqgp ) than a ideal free parton gas @xcite which still flows like an ideal - fluid .",
    "this idea , that the qgp behaves as real ideal fluid , raised an interesting perspective , since the viscosity for the strong coupling limit of 4d conformal theory obtained from the supersymmetric string theory in an ( anti de sitter ) ads space found to be very small @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , hirano and gyulassy argue that this is due to the entropy density of the qgp which is much larger than that of the hadronic phase @xcite .    at any rate ,",
    "we know that there still exist several open problems in the interpretation of data in terms of the hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "these questions require careful examination to extract quantitative and precise information on the properties of qgp .",
    "in particular , we should study the effect of dissipative processes on the collective flow variables .",
    "several works have been done in this direction @xcite . however , strictly speaking , a quantitative and consistent analysis of the viscosity within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics has not yet been done completely .",
    "this is because the introduction of dissipative phenomena in relativistic hydrodynamics casts difficult problems , both conceptual and technical .",
    "initially eckart , and later , landau - lifshitz introduced the dissipative effects in relativistic hydrodynamics in a covariant manner eckart , ll .",
    "it is , however , known that their formalism leads to the problem of acausality , that is , a pulse signal propagates with infinite speed .",
    "thus , relativistic covariance is not a sufficient condition for a consistent relativistic dissipative dynamics @xcite .    to cure this problem ,",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics in the framework of extended thermodynamics was developed by mller @xcite and later by israel and stewart @xcite . from the kinetic point of view @xcite",
    ", this formalism corresponds to the extension of equilibrium thermodynamics to include the second order moments of kinetic variables .",
    "this is the reason why this theory is usually referred to as the second order theory .",
    "however , this theory is too general and complex , introducing many unknown parameters from the point of the present qcd dynamics .",
    "moreover , the irreversible currents are treated as independent variables in addition to the usual hydrodynamical degrees of freedom ( the velocity field plus densities of extensive quantities ) and should be obtained by solving highly coupled partial differential equations .",
    "these features make the application of the theory to practical problems very difficult .    on the other hand ,",
    "even if we overcome the technical difficulties to apply the complete theory to the analysis of relativistic heavy ion reactions , it is very unlikely that we can extract such a detailed information from the experimental data at present moment .",
    "this is because there exist many uncertainties of the hydrodynamical approach itself such as the initial condition , finite size correction , event - by - event fluctuations , particle decoupling process etc .",
    "however , there exists some interesting questions which requires a correct treatment of the viscosity in a realistic 3d simulations , such as a possible generation of shock wave and its propagation in the qgp triggered by a jet@xcite .",
    "analysis of such phenomena will certainly give important information of new , genuine hydrodynamical properties of the qgp .",
    "therefore , what we need now is not a very general theory of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with so many unknown parameters but one with the minimum number of parameters necessary to preserve fundamental principles such as causality and entropy production .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it is known that the israel - stewart theory ( is ) is not the unique approach to relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics . to authors knowledge",
    ", there is at least one other causal theory called the divergence type @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a very simple alternative theory which satisfies the minimal conditions mentioned above .",
    "we show that the causality problem of the landau - lifshitz formalism can be solved by introducing a memory effect .",
    "this memory effect is characterized by the relaxation time @xmath0 , so that our theory introduces only one additional parameter to the usual bulk viscosity , shear viscosity and thermal conduction coefficients of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "our theory recovers the relativistic navier - stokes equation in the limit of vanishing values of this relaxation time .",
    "as described later more in detail , our approach has a fundamental advantage from the practical point of view in addition to its physical simplicity .",
    "the dissipative terms are explicitly given by the integral of the independent variables of the usual ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "thus , the implementation of our method to the existing ideal hydro - codes is straightforward , particularly , to those based on the local lagrangian coordinate system such as spherio @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the problem of the acausal propagation in the diffusion equation and the method to cure this problem in terms of the memory effect , which leads to the so - called telegraphist s equation . in the sec .",
    "iii , we analyse the structure of the landau - lifshitz theory of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics and introduce the memory effect to solve the acausal problem due to its parabolic nature . we thus obtain the dissipative hydrodynamical equations with the minimum number of parameters which satisfies causality . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the problem of entropy production in our formalism . in sec.v , we apply our equation to the bjorken solution , and compare with the previous analyses @xcite . in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our results and discuss possible immediate applications .",
    "the fundamental problem of the first order theory like the navier - stokes theory comes from the fact that the diffusion equation is parabolic .",
    "this means that the velocity of signal propagation is infinite .",
    "this problem was first addressed by cattaneo @xcite in the case of heat conduction .",
    "he discussed that the problem of acausal propagation in usual diffusion equation , @xmath1 can be cured by the introduction of the second order time derivative as @xmath2 thus converting the parabolic equation to a hyperbolic one . here ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are a diffusion constant and a relaxation time , respectively .",
    "eq.([tele ] ) is sometimes called as telegraphist s equation . for a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3",
    ", we can recover the causal propagation of diffusion process .",
    "in fact , the maximum velocity of the signal propagation governed by this equation is shown to be @xcite @xmath5 to be consistent with the special relativity , we should have @xmath6 the diffusion equation , eq.([diffusion ] ) , corresponds to @xmath7 and hence @xmath8    the physical origin of above telegraphist s equation can be understood as follows .",
    "the diffusion process is a typical relaxation process for a conserved quantity .",
    "thus , it should satisfy the equation of continuity , @xmath9 in non - equilibrium thermodynamics , the irreversible current @xmath10 is assumed to be proportional to a thermodynamic force , @xmath11 where the onsager coefficient @xmath12 is , in general , a function of thermodynamic quantities . here",
    ", we assume it to be constant for the sake of illustration .",
    "when @xmath13 is a number density , the thermodynamic force is given by the gradient of @xmath13 because of fick s law , @xmath14 substituting eq.([curr ] ) into eq.([cont ] ) , we get the diffusion equation ( [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "fick s law tells us that the above diffusion process is induced by inhomogeneous distribution . in eq.([curr ] ) , the space inhomogeneity immediately gives rise to the irreversible current .",
    "however , this is a very idealized situation . in general",
    ", the generation of irreversible currents has a time delay .",
    "thus , we may think of memory effects within the linear response of the system .",
    "phenomenologically , this can be done by introducing the following memory function @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath0 is a constant ( relaxation time ) and rewrite eq.([curr ] ) as @xmath16 in the limit of @xmath17 we have @xmath18 so that the original equation ( [ curr ] ) is recovered @xcite .",
    "the time derivative of the irreversible current ( [ retard ] ) leads to @xmath19 this is called the maxwell - cattaneo type equation . substituting into the equation of continuity ( [ cont ] ) ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath20 which is exactly eq .",
    "( [ tele ] ) .",
    "we here showed the problem of acausality in the diffusion equation , which is based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics ( the first order theory ) , and how this can be solved by introducing the memory function . for more microscopic derivation of telegraphist s equation and foundation of the second order theory ,",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it was recently shown that the macroscopic equation of motion , which is obtained by using systematic coarse - grainings from the heisenberg equation of motion , is not the diffusion equation but telegraphist s equation @xcite .",
    "till now , we have emphasized the importance of the memory effect in the view of causality , but there exists another important reason to introduce the memory effect .",
    "it was pointed out that the diffusion equation also contradicts with sum rules associated with conservation laws .",
    "this can also be solved by replacing the diffusion equation with telegraphist s equation @xcite .",
    "relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics should be consistent with qcd , where there are conserved quantities and associated sum rules . in this sense",
    ", the presence of memory effect should be inevitable .",
    "eckart and landau - lifshitz derived the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics following non - equilibrium thermodynamics as discussed in the preceding section @xcite .",
    "their theories are just the covariant versions of the navier - stokes equation and the corresponding equations still continue to be parabolic",
    ". therefore , they do not satisfy causality and some modification should be required . in the is and the divergence type theory ,",
    "the definition of the entropy four - flux is generalized and , to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics , modified thermodynamic forces are obtained . in this section , we propose another approach , where the problem of acausality is solved by introducing the memory effect like eq .",
    "( [ retard ] ) .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us first analyse briefly the structure of the landau - lifshitz theory ( ll ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical equation of motion is written as the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath21 together with the conservation of a quantity , for example , the baryon number , @xmath22 in the ll , it is assumed that thermodynamic relations are valid in the local rest frame of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is expressed as @xmath23 where , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the energy density , pressure , four velocity of the fluid and bulk and shear viscous stresses . in the ll",
    ", the velocity field is defined in such a way that the energy current vanishes in the local rest frame , @xmath29 . in this local rest frame , it is assumed that the equation of state and thermodynamical relations are valid as if the fluid were in equilibrium . as usual , we write @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lorentz factor and @xmath32 the tensor @xmath33 is the projection operator to the space orthogonal to @xmath34 and given by @xmath35 which has the following trace property , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the number of spatial dimensions .    in the ll ,",
    "the current for the conserved quantity ( e.g. , net baryon number ) takes the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the heat conduction part of the current . for the irreversible currents",
    ", we require the constraints @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 these constraints permit us to interpret @xmath24 and @xmath13 respectively as the energy and net baryon number densities in the local rest frame .",
    "in fact , from eq.([orthogonal2 ] ) , in the rest frame , we have @xmath42 so that @xmath13 is the net baryon number density in the local rest frame .",
    "it is noteworthy that , different from the ideal case ( or eckart case ) , @xmath43 is not related with the net baryon number density @xmath13 in any frame by the lorentz contraction , but @xmath44    with these irreversible currents , of course , the entropy is not conserved . instead , from eqs.([divtmunu ] ) and",
    "( [ divn ] ) with the constraints eqs .",
    "( [ orthogonal1 ] ) and ( [ orthogonal2 ] ) , we have @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 with temperature @xmath47 and chemical potential @xmath48 .",
    "landau - lifshitz identifies the term @xmath49 as the entropy four - flux .",
    "the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ s - current ] ) is the source term for entropy production .    in non - equilibrium thermodynamics",
    ", it is interpreted that entropy production is the sum of the products of thermodynamic forces and irreversible currents .",
    "thus , we can define the scalar , vector and tensor thermodynamic forces , @xmath50 respectively . to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics , we assume that the entropy production is positive , @xmath51 to maintain this algebraic positive definiteness , the most general irreversible currents are given by linear combinations of the thermodynamic forces with the coefficients appropriately chosen",
    ". however , if we accept the curie ( symmetry ) principle which forbids the mixture of different types of thermodynamic forces @xcite , the irreversible currents are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 are bulk viscosity , shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath56 is the double symmetric traceless projection,@xmath57 and we have introduced the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 which correspond respectively to the shear tensor and irreversible current before the projection .",
    "they are in general not orthogonal to @xmath34 so the projection operators are necessary to satisfy the constraints eqs.([orthogonal1 ] ) and ( [ orthogonal2 ] ) .    eqs.([viscous ] ) are the prescription of the ll . as mentioned , the ll leads to the acausal propagation of signal .",
    "so we should modify these equations to satisfy the relativistic causality principle .",
    "the basic point is that the equations of the ll form a parabolic system and we have to convert it to the hyperbolic one .",
    "however , at this moment , the generalization of these equation in order to obtain hyperbolic equations is rather self - evident .",
    "we introduce the memory function in each irreversible currents , eq.([viscous ] ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the local proper time . as before , the shear tensor @xmath28 and the irreversible current @xmath62 are then given by the projection of these integrals as@xmath63    when we start with the finite initial time , say , @xmath64 the above integrals should read@xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 are initial conditions given at @xmath69 .",
    "the bulk viscosity can be determined by @xmath70 and @xmath71 as@xmath72 as for @xmath67 and @xmath73 we observe that they are the projected part of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , @xmath76 this is equivalent to set up the following initial conditions , @xmath77 the initial four - velocity @xmath78 is determined as the time - like eigenvector of the matrix @xmath70 with eigenvalue @xmath79 using the equation of state together with @xmath80 we can determine the pressure @xmath81    in eqs.([integrals ] ) , we have used the same memory function @xmath82 and consequently a common relaxation time @xmath0 for the bulk and shear viscosities and heat conduction .",
    "we could have used different relaxation times for each irreversible current and this would not alter the basic structure of our theory . however , here we stay with a common relaxation time for all of them for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we consider the situation where the time scales of the microscopic degrees of freedom are well separated from those of the macroscopic ones .",
    "then , the effect of the differences of the microscopic relaxation times should not be much relevant in the dynamics described in the macroscopic time scale .",
    "thus we just represent these microscopic time scales in terms of one relaxation time @xmath83    the integral expressions ( [ integrals ] ) are equivalent to the following differential equations , @xmath84where @xmath85is the total derivative with respect to the proper time . in a practical implementation of our theory",
    ", we may solve the above differential equations together with the other hydrodynamical part . in this case ,",
    "if we wish , we may add also the terms which violates the curie principle , without any extra difficulties .",
    "the above equations , after the projection ( [ projection ] ) , can be compared to the corresponding equations in the simplest version of the is , which are obtained phenomenologically based on extended thermodynamics , @xmath86where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants .",
    "note that the definitions of parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are different from that of the is . eqs.([derivatives ] ) and ( ism ) have similar aspects , in particular , if we include the terms which violate the curie principle and introduce the 3 different relaxation times .",
    "however , our equation is _ not _ a special case of the is . in the is , the projection operators , which are necessary to satisfy the orthogonality conditions ( [ orthogonal1 ] ) and ( [ orthogonal2 ] ) , are included in the differential equations themselves .",
    "thus , it is not possible to derive our equations from the is . for example , in our theory , we can write down the differential equation of the heat conduction @xmath92 by using eq .",
    "( [ derivatives ] ) as follows , @xmath93 the last term of the above equation do not appear in the is .    in practice , the differential equations for the irreversible currents can be solved together with the equations of motion of the usual hydrodynamic variables in a coupled way . in the case of the is , due to the presence of projection operators",
    ", these irreversible current should be determined simultaneously with the equations for acceleration of the fluid .",
    "thus , in the general 3d case , @xmath94 matrix inversion is required in each time step . in our case , due to the memory effect integral",
    ", the equation for the acceleration of fluid can be determined only from the past values of the irreversible currents , so that we need the inversion of at most @xmath95 matrix for the acceleration of the fluid .",
    "the time derivatives for the irreversible currents are decoupled from the normal hydrodynamic variables .    in spite of these differences ,",
    "our equations are found to be still hyperbolic in the linearized form .",
    "when we consider the propagation of small perturbations on the homogeneous and static background , the projection operator turns out to be a constant matrix .",
    "therefore we can easily see that our linearized equation of motion has the same structure as the is with @xmath96 .",
    "thus the speed of pulse propagation is finite as discussed by hiscock - lindblom @xcite .    in our case , we can explicit the space component of the four - divergence of the shear tensor @xmath97 can be written as @xmath98   \\notag \\\\ & + \\frac{d\\pi ^{\\left ( \\mu \\ i\\right ) } ( \\tau ) } { d\\tau } \\partial _ { \\mu } \\tau -\\nabla \\cdot \\left ( u^{i}u_{\\alpha } \\left ( \\vec{\\pi}^{\\alpha } -\\widetilde{% \\pi } ^{\\left ( \\alpha \\ 0\\right ) } \\vec{v}\\right ) \\right ) + \\frac{1}{3}\\partial ^{i}(p_{\\alpha \\beta } \\widetilde{\\pi } ^{(\\alpha \\beta ) } ) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma   \\frac{d}{d\\tau } \\frac{u^{i}\\widetilde{\\pi } _ { \\alpha } ^{\\alpha } } { \\sigma } , \\label{dtaumunu}\\end{aligned}\\]]where we have introduced the symmetric tensor , @xmath99and used the three - vector notation,@xmath100furthermore , for the sake of later convenience we have introduced the reference density  @xmath101 defined by@xmath102this will play an important role for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) formulation @xcite . note that , in general for any function @xmath103 we have the identity , @xmath104    the equation of motion finally has the form , @xmath105   \\notag \\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\partial_{i}\\left ( p+\\pi+\\frac{1}{3}\\left ( p^{\\alpha\\beta}\\widetilde{\\pi}_{\\left ( \\alpha\\ \\beta\\right ) } \\right ) \\right ) -\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\frac{d\\widetilde{\\pi}^{\\left ( \\mu\\ i\\right ) } ( \\tau)}{d\\tau   } \\partial_{\\mu}\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\nabla\\cdot\\left ( u^{i}u_{\\alpha}\\left (   \\vec{\\pi } ^{\\alpha}-\\widetilde{\\pi}^{\\left ( \\alpha\\ 0\\right ) } \\vec{v}\\right ) \\right ) .",

    "from the practical point of view , our approach has several advantages to the is in addition to its simple physical structure .",
    "although the is invokes the information from the kinetic theory , it is not probable that we can determine the parameters from the relativistic heavy ion processes quantitatively at the present moment . from the theoretical point of view , one could try to fix these parameters by using the boltzmann equation approach to qcd .",
    "however , the boltzmann equation is applicable to describe the behavior of a gas and if the qgp is a strongly interacting fluid , then such an approach will fail . rather , we prefer to keep the simplest physical structure of the navier - stokes theory preserving causality . to accomplish this",
    ", we simply introduced the memory effect characterized by the relaxation time .",
    "all irreversible currents are then expressed by eq.([integrals ] ) .",
    "we only need the past values of the independent variables of the usual ideal fluid dynamics to advance in time .",
    "the integral expressions ( [ integrals ] ) are easy to be evaluated when we use the lagrangian coordinate system .",
    "because of the simple form of the dissipative terms , it is straightforward to incorporate these equations to the realistic full three - dimensional hydro - code such as spherio @xcite .    until now",
    ", we have considered that the relaxation time @xmath0 is constant .",
    "however in practical problems , it is a function of thermodynamical variables",
    ". then the memory function should be generalized as@xmath118 even in this case , eqs.([integrals ] ) and ( [ eqmotion ] ) are still valid .",
    "it should be emphasized that our theory is not a simplified version of the is but there exists an essential difference for the treatment of the entropy production term .",

    "this might seem to be dangerous .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the increase of entropy is essentially a concept in the equilibrium thermodynamics and the requirement of positiveness should apply only to thermal equilibrium states . as a matter of fact",

    "for the example discussed below , we can show explicitly the positive definiteness of entropy production on our formulation .    in the above",
    ", we considered the relaxation time as constant just for the illustration .",
    "the similar conclusion can be derived when the variation of the relaxation time is not so violent .",

    "sometimes the emergence of the initial heat - up in the ll ( the dashed curve in fig.1 ) is interpreted as an intrinsic problem of the first order theory . however",
    ", such behavior can also appear even in the second order theory . in fig .",
    "2 , we set @xmath180 and @xmath181 as the initial conditions . in particular , the initial heat - up also appear in the second order depending on the initial condition for the irreversible currents ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore",
    ", this heat - up is not the problem of the first order theory but rather the specific property of the scaling ansatz .",
    "this was already pointed out by muronga .",
    "the physical reason for this heat - up is due to the use of the bjorken solution for the velocity field . in this case",
    ", the system acts as if an external force is applied to keep the velocity field as a given function of @xmath182 thus , depending on the relative intensity of the viscous terms compared to the pressure , the external work converted to the local heat production can overcome the temperature decrease due to the expansion .    ) .",
    "the last line from the top is the result of ideal hydrodynamics . in this case , the energy heat - up is observed even in our theory . ]",
    "one of the most important questions in the relativistic heavy ion physics is to determine the effect of dissipation in flow dynamics of plasma of quarks and gluons .",
    "however , a consistent calculation of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics is not trivial at all .",
    "some important questions such as propagation of shock wave in the hot qcd matter require a careful treatment of the dissipative processes .",
    "the israel - stewart theory and the divergence type theory contain many parameters difficult to be determined from qcd point of view and also it is technically difficult to be implemented on practical calculations in its full form @xcite .    from the practical point of view , it is not desirable to deal with many of such parameters , since the hydrodynamical approach to the relativistic heavy ion reaction processes itself has already many uncertainties @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the is is not easy to apply at the present stage of the analysis of heavy ion physics data .",
    "furthermore , when we deal with numerical solutions , we still encounter ambiguities . because dissipations and relaxation times , required to reproduce the bulk properties of fluid , are not necessarily the same as those determined from the microscopic theory such as lattice qcd calculations . in a practical numerical calculation",
    ", the truncation of hydrodynamic degrees of freedom to the discredited variables introduces a natural cut - off frequencies , and the elimination of those degrees of freedom such as small scale vorticities or turbulences will appear as effective viscosities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the standard numerical method for dealing with shock phenomena is to introduce the pseudo - viscosity , first invented by von neumann and richtmyer@xcite .",
    "it is basically the bulk viscosity depending on the size of the hydro cell . for relativistic shock motion ,",
    "we need to incorporate such mechanism to the hydrodynamical code . considering these aspects , it is desirable to study the effect of dissipation with the minimum number of parameters which characterize the physical processes involved and is still consistent with the framework of relativity .    in this paper",
    ", we proposed an alternative approach to this question , different from the is .",
    "we start from the physical analysis of the irreversible currents according to the landau - lifshitz theory .",
    "then , the irreversible currents are given by integral expressions which take into account the relaxation time . in this way",
    ", causality is recovered and at the same time a simple physical structure of the ll is preserved . in our approach , only one additional parameter was introduced , the relaxation time , @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting equation of motion then becomes hyperbolic and causality can be restored @xcite .",
    "naturally , causality depends on the choice of the values of the parameters including the relaxation time .",
    "more specifically , we verified that the linearized equation of motion for small perturbations in the homogeneous , static background coincides with hiscock - lindblom @xcite except for the coupling among the different irreversible currents .",
    "these couplings are not included in our theory considering the curie principle .",
    "of course the curie principle is believed to be valid in the regime of the first order theory and in the second order regime these couplings might be present . however",
    ", the existence of the curie principle may imply that these couplings are small compared with the direct terms .",
    "in addition to its simplicity compared to the is , our formalism has several practical advantages .",
    "first , the number of independent variables is kept the same as those of the ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the irreversible currents are expressed explicitly as memory integrals of these independent variables . in extended ( irreversible ) thermodynamics ,",
    "the currents are treated as extended thermodynamic variables and thermodynamic relations are modified jou , eosjou .",
    "thus , in the is , we should take the modification of thermodynamic relations into account but in our case the usual thermodynamical relations should be used .",
    "second , in the is , the projection operators enters in the equations of motion in a complicated way so it is not trivial to extract the standard form to apply the conventional method of the time integration . in our case , this does not occur .",
    "instead , we need just some additional integrals associated with the local comoving coordinates .",
    "finally , our simplified structure permits to include all of the irreversible currents , such as bulk and shear viscosities and thermal conduction at the same time without any difficulties .",
    "the essential difference of our formalism from the is is the expression for entropy production . in the",
    "is , the entropy production is required to be positive definite algebraically .",
    "thus , the integral form like our formulation is not possible even neglecting some coupling terms .",
    "we relaxed this condition , that is , the positiveness of entropy production is required only for the hydrodynamical motion with time scales longer than the relaxation time . for extremely violent change of variables ,",
    "the instantaneous entropy for a hydrodynamic cell would not necessarily be positive definite .",
    "we have applied our theory to the case of the one - dimensional scaling solution of bjorken and obtained the analogous behavior of previous analysis . in this case",
    "we can prove explicitly the positiveness of entropy production .",
    "we showed the time evolution of the temperature . as expected",
    ", our theory gives the same result of ref .",
    "@xcite , because the no - acceleration condition used in ref .",
    "@xcite is automatically satisfied in this model .",
    "note that our theory is applicable to more general case where the acceleration is important .",
    "the transport coefficients contained in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics should in principle be calculated from qcd . in the first order theory",
    ", it is known that the transports coefficients can be calculated by the kubo formula @xcite .",
    "however , this formula does not gives the transport coefficients in the second order theory , as is shown in ref .",
    "koide1 explicitly and the corresponding corrections should be evaluated .",
    "our theory is particularly adequate to be applied to the hydro - code such as spherio which is based on the lagrangian coordinate system spherio , review .",
    "implementation of the present theory to the full three - dimensional hydrodynamics is now in progress .",
