    "novel topological responses of quantum topological fluids , such as hall viscosity @xcite , appear when these systems are coupled to a curved background @xcite .",
    "geometry has been also employed in the study of scattering processes in topological insulators @xcite and in the analysis of ripples and novel emergent phenomena in graphene @xcite .",
    "furthermore , advanced geometric theories , based on non - commutative geometry @xcite and holography @xcite have been employed in the study of fractional quantum hall states , non - fermi liquids , strongly - correlated systems , etc .",

    "importantly , the geometric properties of quantum systems can be based on the gauge principle : the coupling between matter and spacetime is identified by gauging the global spacetime symmetries of the matter field @xcite . in the case of dirac materials @xcite , the quasiparticles are given by dirac fermions and the lorentz symmetries ( i.e. rotations and boosts ) emerge at ground state .",
    "thus , in order to study these phases in curved spacetime , one has to gauge the lorentz group and replaces the derivative with the covariant derivative , where the corresponding spin connection takes values in the lorentz algebra @xcite .",
    "the presence of the external magnetic field induces in the quantum states further symmetries , called magnetic translations , which are the proper symmetries of a ( infinite ) plane in presence of a constant magnetic field @xcite .",

    "iv , we introduce the maxwell algebra and we show that it correctly takes into account the magnetic translations , induced on the boundary of the system by the presence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "v that the the model found in sec .",
    "iii can be nicely extending by gauging the maxwell algebra .",

    "( [ eft ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is a total derivative that gives rise to an abelian chern - simons term on the boundary .",
    "this topological quantum field theory describes the hall conductance of relativistic quantum hall states on the surface @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the system defined on a lorentzian manifold @xmath27 where space - like part @xmath28 has periodic boundary conditions in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while the periodicity in @xmath31 is broken in order to have a boundary made by two disconnected surface .",
    "similarly to the case of topological superconductors @xcite , here the whole gapped boundary can be seen an effective two - dimensional topological phase belonging the class a @xcite and supports topological protected effective edge modes .",
    "these one - dimensional dirac edge modes are trapped by the defect lines that can be created on the gapped surfaces by employing a couple of local zeeman fields @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will show that the holographic correspondence , already employed in the case of topological superconductors @xcite , is still valid in the case of topological insulators and allows us to derive the right value of the chiral central charge associated to the chiral dirac modes .",
    "in order to derive an effective geometric theory for the three - dimensional topological insulator , we first observe that the dirac theory is invariant under the global poincar group .",
    "in other words , in the low - energy limit , topological insulators support further emergent relativistic symmetries , given by lorentz boosts and rotations , and spacetime translations . by gauging these symmetries ,",
    "we can understand how the system behaves under local geometric transformations that preserve locally the poincar group .",
    "this approach has been also employed in the study of geometric defects in topological phases and in the generalization of the luttinger theory @xcite , where a minimal coupling between fermions and the background geometry has been used in order to derive thermal quantum effects , such as the thermal hall effect @xcite .",
    "the gauging procedure in the fermion theory is made by replacing the standard derivative with a covariant derivative and by introducing the tetrads , which allows us to write the dirac action in the curved space @xmath32 , given by @xmath33=\\int_{m_{c } } d^{4}x\\,|e|\\ , \\overline{\\psi}\\,(i\\,\\widehat{\\gamma}^{\\mu}d_{\\mu}-m)\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the determinant of the tetrads @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spin connection @xcite .",

    "however , this is not the conclusive topological action because , so far , we have omitted possible contributions in the effective action induced by the maxwell term .",
    "in fact , the maxwell theory in 3 + 1 dimensions supports the duality symmetry , defined by the following transformation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an angle and @xmath50 .",
    "however , this symmetry holds only in the flat case and is broken by quantum effects when the theory is defined on a generic curved spacetime , as shown in refs .",
    "it is possible to show that the duality anomaly induces a topological term proportional to the pontryagin invariant , similarly to that one found in the fermionic sector .",

    "<S> we propose a novel geometric model of three - dimensional topological insulators in presence of an external electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the gapped boundary of these systems supports relativistic quantum hall states and is described by a chern - simons theory with a gauge connection that takes values in the maxwell algebra . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a non - central extension of the poincar algebra and takes into account both the lorentz and magnetic - translation symmetries of the surface states . </S>",
    "<S> in this way , we derive a relativistic version of the wen - zee term , and we show that the non - minimal coupling between the background geometry and the electromagnetic field in the model is in agreement with the main properties of the relativistic quantum hall states in the flat space . </S>"
