    "the central theme of spintronics is to manipulate the extra spin degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems@xcite .",
    "one of the proposals is to manipulate the spin polarization of electrons by the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction@xcite such as the rashba interaction from the structural inversion asymmetry at a surface or interface in semiconductors@xcite . to make these proposals feasible in spintronics ,",
    "it is important to achieve a flexible tuning of the interaction strength .",
    "so far , many surprising works have demonstrated how to enhance the strength of the rashba interaction either in a semiconductor or in some metal spin - splitting surface states .",
    "for instance , by doping bi into gaas , it was shown that the spin - splitting gap is significantly enhanced in the alloy @xmath0@xcite , which opens up an alternative approach to enhance the rashba coupling in semiconductors .",
    "furthermore , it was shown recently that the surface states of bi / ag show a giant rashba - type spin splitting due to the surface - potential barrier@xcite .",
    "in addition , it was also demonstrated that , by doping pb into bi / ag , the fermi energy of the surface states is tunable@xcite .",
    "these exciting discoveries open up the possibilities to manipulate the rashba coupling over a wide range of interaction strengths .",
    "therefore , it is important and exciting to explore the related physics properties in both weak and strong regimes where the fermi surface ( fs ) topologies are different .",
    "note that the rashba interaction in a two - dimensional electron gas gives rise to two different fs topologies that may play a significant role in dictating the response functions .",
    "the classical dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism of spin relaxation@xcite due to rashba coupling shows different signatures when the fs topology changes . in weak coupling",
    ", the dp relaxation mechanism leads to exponential decay@xcite .",
    "but , in strong coupling ( or equivalently , the low - density regime ) , the dp relaxation mechanism changes into a peculiar power law@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in strong coupling , the cancellation of the spin - hall conductivity for spin - conserving momentum scattering@xcite is not related to the vanishing of the vertex function , as happened in the weak regime .",
    "instead , the cancellation is between the on - fermi surface and off - fermi surface contributions@xcite .",
    "another example is the disorder - induced localization due to the rashba coupling@xcite .",
    "for a two - dimensional electron gas with strong rashba coupling , it behaves effectively as an one - dimensional system@xcite , which results in infinite bound states even for a short - range potential@xcite .",
    "the topological change of the fs also plays an interesting role in superconductivity@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the critical temperature of the superconductor can be tuned by the rashba coupling , suggesting materials with stronger rashba coupling are good candidates for enhanced superconductivity@xcite .",
    "finally , in our previous work@xcite , we demonstrated that the exchange coupling mediated by itinerant carriers with rashba coupling is strongly tied up with the fs topology .",
    "we showed numerically that the non - collinear exchange coupling reveals two spatial trends depending on the fs topologies ",
    "one is the rkky - like oscillatory behavior and the other is the spiral .",
    "here we extend our previous work@xcite by a complementary analytic approach within the path - integral formalism .",
    "this method is particularly powerful in describing the asymptotic behavior of the mediated exchange coupling and provides a comprehensive understanding of the general trends . in the weak rashba regime ,",
    "the exchange coupling consists of the rkky oscillations at shorter length scale and a spiral background@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rkky interaction is suppressed when entering the strong coupling regime .",
    "it is rather nice that the analytic results agree with previous numerics .",
    "we also use a phenomenological approach to investigate the effect of the finite spin relaxation in the itinerant carriers .",
    "since the finite relaxation rate breaks the time - reversal symmetry , it leads to the suppression of the rkky interaction .",
    "thus , the non - collinear spiral interaction stands out and becomes dominant .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we revisit the ferromagnetic / normal / ferromagnetic trilayer junction mediated by a two - dimensional electron gas with rashba interaction .",
    "the band structure and the fermi surface topologies at different carrier concentrations are explained in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the mediated exchange coupling within linear response theory . after integrating out the angular part , the resultant formula can be implemented in numerics to calculate the effective exchange coupling . in sec .",

    "[ rkky ] . in the weak rashba regime @xmath42 , the spatial trends of the angle @xmath29 oscillates near the vicinity of @xmath43 and is very similar to the ordinary rkky interaction .",
    "the main difference is that , in the presence of the spin - orbit coupling , there is an upward background .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is characterized by @xmath44 as in ordinary rkky oscillations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the spatial trend is drastically different from the spin - precession argument in datta - das sfet@xcite because the quantum interferences from different patches of the fermi surface can not be ignored .",

    "since the local gauge transformation is nothing but the local rotation about the @xmath49-axis with the spiral angle @xmath50 , the reduced susceptibility is approximately the usual rkky oscillation twisted by a local spiral transformation , @xmath51_{ac } \\chi^{rkky}_{cb}(r),\\ ] ] where the summation over the repeated index @xmath52 is implied .",

    "[ spiral ] . at first glance ,",
    "the spiral evolution is similar to the spin - precession argument in datta - das sfet .",

    "the semiclassical spin precession is described by the length scale @xmath56 .",
    "but , as fig . [ spiral ] shows , the spiraling length in our numerics is @xmath57 . only in the extreme strong coupling",
    "where @xmath58 , the semiclassical picture will be completely correct .",
    "it is important to mention that the momentum @xmath59 connects patches of the outer fermi surface which are related by time - reversal symmetry.the period of the spiral angle indicates that the exchange coupling mainly contribute by the interference of the time - reversal section of outside chirality . since the mediated exchange coupling is spiral - like , many phenomena , in this regime , related to the rkky exchange coupling should be reconsidered .",
    "for example , a tunable non - local spin control in a coupled quantum dot system via a gate voltage has been beautifully demonstrated in the 2d electron gas system of semiconductor@xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the kondo effect is suppressed by a nonlocal rkky - like interaction which can be used to control the quantum dot spin .",
