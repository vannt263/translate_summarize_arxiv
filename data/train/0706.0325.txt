    "this scenario serves as a possible component of the physics beyond standard model above tev scale , which can be explored experimentally at the lhc and ilc in future .",
    "although conformal symemetry is widely and deeply studied in the condense matter physics ( mostly in 2-dimension ) and the superstring theory ( generally in high dimension and with the supersymmetry ) , we know little about the conformal symmetry in 4-dimension and how it is manifested in particle physics experiments , if unparticle really exists .",
    "unparticle is very different from the ordinary matters , some exotic and remarkable properties have been demonstrated , @xmath7 it looks like a non - integral number @xmath3 of invisible massless particles with unusual phase space , where @xmath3 is the scale dimension of the relevant unparticle operator @xmath8 .",
    "the peculiar two - point correlation function of unparticle can produce unusual interference patterns in the time - like region and so on@xcite .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of unparticle and its possible signatures have been discussed by several authors . in a previous paper@xcite , we have discussed the virtual effects of unparticle in the dis processes to the lowest nontrivial order of the couplings of the unparticle with the sm fields .",
    "the leading order corrections to the structure functions are the interference terms between the vector unparticle exchange amplitudes and the standard model amplitudes in the space - like region@xcite .",
    "unparticle production in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , unparticle effects in the drell - yan process , fermionic unparticle , its physical effects on muon anomalous magnetic moments , @xmath11 mixing and @xmath12 mixing , the lepton flavor violating processes , as well as the bounds on unparticle from the higgs sector and the deconstruction of unparticle _ etc _ have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "as we have shown in ref.@xcite , the low energy effective interactions between the sm fermions and unparticle can take the following form : @xmath13 where @xmath3 is the scale dimension of the relevant unparticle operator ( @xmath14 or @xmath8 ) , and @xmath14 is a transverse and hermitian operator .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "those effective interactions are the leading order interactions between the sm fermions and the vector(scalar ) unparticle , and universal couplings have been assumed here .",
    "scale invariance determines the two - point correlation function of unparticle operator to be @xmath17 where @xmath18    in this work , we shall study the particular aspects of unparticle physics in atomic parity violation(apv ) along an isotope chain and in the nutev experiment .",
    "since both apv and nutev experiment are important low energy probes to new physics beyond sm , which complements new physics searches at high energy colliders ( such as lhc and ilc ) .",
    "therefore , they should play important role in exploring unparticle physics together with lhc and ilc in future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the physics effects of unparticle in apv along an isotope chain and the associated theoretical uncertainties are investigated .",

    "low energy parity violation observables have played important role in uncovering and testing the structure of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",

    "provide powerfully complementary probes of new physics at the tev scale .",
    "the basic quantity of interest in considering weak neutral current parity violation is the so - called weak charge @xmath19 .",
    "this quantity is the weak neutral current analog of the electron - magnetic charge , which characterizes the strength of the electron axial vector times nucleus(or electron ) vector weak neutral current interaction .",
    "the most precise determination of @xmath19 has been obtained with the atomic parity violation in cs(cesium ) by the boulder group@xcite .",
    "there are generally large theoretical uncertainties from atomic structures for the apv observables of a single isotope .",
    "a strategy for evading thess atomic structure uncertainties is to measure the ratios of parity violation observables along an isotope chain@xcite , and the isotopes of ba(barium ) and yb(ytterbium ) are currently under study at seattle and berkeley respectively .",
    "two ratios are usually considered @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the nuclear spin - independent part of the apv observable for an atom with neutron number @xmath22 , which is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 contains all the atomic structure effects for a point nucleus including the many - body corrections . for a single isotope",
    ", a significant source of theoretical uncertainties arises from the computation of the atomic structure dependent constant @xmath24 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that taking ratios between isotopes cancels essentially all dependence on the atomic structure and the associated uncertainties .",
    "however , the nuclear structure dependence does not cancel in the ratios , especially the ratios would receive corrections from the neutron distribution .",
    "the dependence of the parity violation amplitude on the nuclear structure can be incorporated through the corrections to the weak charge , then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nuclear weak charge in the standard model . including the effects of radiative corrections , @xmath26 becomes@xcite @xmath27\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath34 is the correction to the weak charge induced by unparticle , which can be straightforwardly calculated@xcite @xmath35 the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings @xmath15 , @xmath16 between unparticle and sm fermions do nt contribute to the weak charge of nuclei .",
    "these two couplings are forbidden by the sm symmetry if unparticle @xmath36 is sm singlet .",
    "the nuclear structure corrections are contained in @xmath37@xcite , which is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the proton and neutron distributions within atomic nuclei , and @xmath43 is the spatial variation of the electron wavefunction inside the nucleus . in order to get an idea of the relative importance of unparticle contributions and nuclear structure effects , we follow ref.@xcite and consider a simple model in which the nucleus is treated as a sphere of uniform proton and neutron number densities out radii @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . in this case , one obtains@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 the above estimate of @xmath48 yields the same general trend as the detailed calculations from the skyrme model , relativistic or nonrelativistic hartree - fock nuclear calculations , and the mean field methods etc , with the absolute values differing generally by parts in a thousand or less@xcite .",
    "after including both the unparticle and the nuclear structure corrections into the ratios of apv , we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 which give the ratios in the standard model at the leading order . @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the nuclear structure corrections to @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the corresponding corrections arising from unparticle with @xmath57 . dropping the terms containing the factor @xmath58 , which should be quite negligible due to the accidental value of @xmath59 , then we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 , which denotes the shift in the neutron radius(relative to the proton radius ) along the isotope chain .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath56 contains an explicit suppression factor @xmath62 , therefore @xmath55 is more sensitive to unparticle physics than @xmath56 for a given experimental precision . from eq.([rev3])-eq.([add14 ] ) , we can see that both @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend on the product of @xmath4 and @xmath4 , and the dependence of @xmath51 on the variation in neutron radius along the isotope is enhanced by a factor @xmath63 .",
    "thus , if one uses the ratios of apv in different isotopes to learn about the new physics contributions from unparticle , one should have extremely precise knowledge of the shift in neutron radius .",
    "so far the proton distribution is well known from electric probes : electron and muon scattering , optical isotope shifts , muonic atoms etc . whereas there exist no reliable experimental determinations of the neutron distribution so far .",
    "explicit studies of isotope shift @xmath64 associated with @xmath42 have been reported in refs.@xcite , these authors showed that the spread in the predictions of @xmath64 corresponds to a @xmath65 uncertainties in the model average for @xmath64 .",
