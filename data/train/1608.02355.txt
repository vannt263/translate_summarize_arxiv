    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) convolutional codes @xcite , also known as spatially coupled ldpc ( sc - ldpc ) codes @xcite , have attracted a lot of attention because they exhibit a threshold saturation phenomenon : the belief propagation ( bp ) decoder can achieve the threshold of the optimal maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder .",
    "spatial coupling is a general concept that is not limited to ldpc codes .",
    "spatially coupled turbo - like codes ( sc - tcs ) are proposed in @xcite , where some block - wise spatially coupled ensembles of parallel concatenated codes ( sc - pccs ) and serially concatenated codes ( sc - sccs ) are introduced .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of bccs , sc - pccs and sc - sccs is analyzed in @xcite where the exact density evolution ( de ) equations are derived for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) . using de ,",
    "the thresholds of the bp decoder are computed for both uncoupled and coupled ensembles and compared with the corresponding map thresholds .",
    "the obtained numerical results demonstrate that threshold saturation occurs for all considered sc - tc ensembles if the coupling memory is large enough .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of threshold saturation is proved analytically for sc - tcs over the bec in @xcite .",
    "while the uncoupled bcc ensemble suffers from a poor bp threshold , the bp threshold of the coupled ensemble improves significantly even for coupling memory @xmath0 . comparing the bp thresholds of sc - tcs in @xcite",
    "indicates that for a given coupling memory , the type - ii bcc ensemble has the best bp threshold for almost all code rates .    motivated by the good asymptotic performance and the excellent bp thresholds of bccs , our aim in this paper is analyzing the performance of bccs in the finite block - length regime by means of the ensemble weight enumerator . as a first step ,",
    "we derive the finite block - length ensemble weight enumerator function ( wef ) of the uncoupled ensemble by considering uniform random permutations .",
    "then we compute the union bound for uncoupled bccs . the unexpectedly high error floor predicted by",
    "the bound suggests that the bound is affected by the bad performance of codes with poor distance properties .",
    "we therefore compute the union bound on the performance of the expurgated ensemble by excluding the codes with poor distance properties .",
    "the expurgated bound demonstrates very low error floors for moderate permutation sizes .",
    "we also obtain a bound on the minimum distance of the bcc ensemble which reveals that the minimum distance grows linearly with the permutation size .    finally , we prove that the codeword weights of the coupled ensemble are lower bounded by those of the uncoupled ensemble .",
