    "recent detections of near - infrared excesses around a number of metal - rich white dwarfs ( wd ) imply existence of warm circumstellar material reprocessing stellar radiation ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; graham 1990 ; farihi 2010 ) .",
    "spectral modeling suggests that this material resides in an extended , compact , optically thick and geometrically thin disk ( jura 2003 ; jura 2007 ) , similar to the saturn s rings ( cuzzi 2010 ) .",
    "disks have inner edges at several tens of the wd radii @xmath5 , roughly consistent with being set by particle sublimation at these locations .",
    "their outer radii lie close to the roche radius of the wd @xmath6 r@xmath7 , supporting the suggestion by jura ( 2003 ) that such compact debris disks are produced by tidal disruption of asteroid - like bodies scattered into low - periastron orbits by gravitational perturbations of massive planets , which have survived the agb phase of stellar evolution .",
    "availability of large reservoir of high - z elements in the form of debris disk in the immediate vicinity of some wds naturally led to the suggestion ( jura 2003 ) that metal enrichment of these stars is caused by accretion from such disks .",
    "this scenario provides a promising alternative to the previously proposed _ interstellar _ accretion model of metal pollution of wds ( dupuis 1993 ) , which is not consistent with observations of wds with he atmospheres .",
    "theoretical estimates of settling time of heavy elements in wds imply that their observed atmospheric abundances can be maintained against gravitational settling by accretion of metals at rates @xmath8 g s@xmath1 ( farihi 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "if the _ circumstellar _ accretion hypothesis is correct , an evolving disk of debris must be able to supply such @xmath9 to the wd .",
    "the actual transfer of metals from the disk of solids truncated at sublimation radius @xmath10 to the wd must be accomplished in this picture via the gas disk extending from the wd surface to @xmath10 and beyond .",
    "observational evidence of such gaseous component around several metal - rich wds hosting compact debris disks has been found by gnsicke ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) in the form of double - peaked emission lines of ca ii and fe ii .",
    "these spectroscopic signatures are naturally explained as arising in a disk of metallic gas ( no h or he emission lines have been detected around these wds ) in keplerian rotation around wds and spatially coincident with dusty disks ( melis 2010 ) .    even though metals are passed to the wd through the gaseous disk the rate of mass transfer @xmath9",
    "is ultimately controlled by evolution of the particulate disk . by analogy with saturn s rings",
    "one expects that the collisional viscosity in debris disk is too low to drive the non - negligible @xmath9",
    ". however , radiation of the wd can be quite important and rafikov ( 2011 ; hereafter r11 ) demonstrated that poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag on the disk naturally drives mass accretion at the rate @xmath11 g s@xmath1 .",
    "while this @xmath9 is high it still falls short of explaining the highest observed @xmath4 g s@xmath1 .",
    "here we propose a new picture of the debris disk evolution , which naturally combines several physical ingredients present in close vicinity of disk - bearing wds .",
    "our model of the wd - disk system is described below and is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "we assume a disk of solid particles to extend from the roche radius @xmath12 all the way in to the sublimation radius r_s ( ) ^222   r_t_,4 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : r_s ] where @xmath13 is the sublimation temperature of solid particles ( which we take to be @xmath14 k if particles are silicate ) , @xmath15 k ) is the normalized stellar temperature @xmath16 , @xmath5 is the wd radius , and @xmath17 is the ratio of particle emissivities for starlight and for its own thermal radiation ( in the following we assume macroscopic particles and set @xmath18 ) . for @xmath19",
    "( ehrenreich 2011 ) one finds @xmath20 r@xmath7 , in agreement with observations ( jura 2007 , 2009 ) .    at present the size of particles @xmath21 constituting",
    "the disk is rather poorly constrained .",
    "graham ( 1990 ) suggested @xmath22 cm . at the same time high - resolution infrared spectroscopy with irs onboard of _ spitzer _ reveals strong @xmath23 m emission feature in disk spectra indicative of the existence of a population of small , micron - sized silicate dust particles ( jura 2009 ) .",
    "but the fraction of total disk mass locked up in such fine dust is unknown .",
    "the actual particle size is not very important for our treatment as long as the disk is optically thick .",
    "then it is similar to saturn s rings and most likely behaves as a granular flow . in the following",
    "we will treat particulate disk as if it were a solid plate .",
    "solid particles brought to @xmath10 sublimate feeding a disk of metallic gas at this location .",
    "viscous torques cause it to spread all the way to the wd surface providing means of metal transport from @xmath10 to the star .",
    "however , because of angular momentum conservation part of the newly produced metallic gas has to move _ outwards _ of @xmath10 ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) naturally explaining the existence of gaseous disks spatially coexisting with dusty debris disks in some systems ( melis 2010 ) .",
    "jura ( 2008 ) proposed collisional sputtering of small asteroids as another source of metallic gas ; for the sake of clarity we do not consider this mechanism here .",
    "we emphasize here that the two disks have an overlap in _ radial _ distance , while in vertical direction gaseous disk is much more extended than the disk of particles , see figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the latter must be very thin because inelastic collisions between particles rapidly damp any vertical random motions .",
    "external gas disk outside @xmath10 has temperature different from ( higher than ) that of the dust disk at the same radii ( melis 2010 ) because of the different balance of heating and cooling for the two disks .",
    "this keeps gas temperature @xmath24 above the sublimation point even outside @xmath10 , although some condensation of metallic gas on the particle surfaces may be happening there ( we neglect it in this work ) .",
    "simultaneous existence of the two disks of high - z elements in different phases drives their mutual evolution in the following way .",
    "any coupling between the outer portion of the gas disk and particulate disk acts to transfer angular momentum from the faster rotating particulate disk to the slower spinning gaseous disk , causing inward motion of particles in the disk of solids .",
    "if the coupling is strong enough positive feedback becomes possible in the system : increasing mass of gaseous disk leads to the increase of @xmath9 through the disk of solids ( as described below ) , which in turn reinforces evaporation at @xmath10 and increases gaseous mass even further .",
    "coupling between the gaseous and particulate high - z disks arises because gaseous disk orbits wd at angular speed @xmath25 slightly lower than the keplerian speed @xmath26 at which the disk of solid particles rotates .",
    "this difference is caused by the pressure support present in gaseous disk , @xmath27 , and is known to cause a variety of important effects in protoplanetary disks , such as inward migration of solids ( weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "relative azimuthal velocity between the gaseous and particulate disks at distance @xmath28 from the wd is v_=c_s10 ^ 2 ^ -1 ( m_,1 ^ -1 ) ^1/2 , [ eq : v_rel ] where @xmath29 is a constant , @xmath30 is the normalized wd mass @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight of the metallic gas normalized by @xmath33 ( value of @xmath34 for pure si ) , @xmath35 k ) is the normalized gas temperature @xmath24 , and @xmath36 km s@xmath37 is the gas sound speed ( clearly @xmath38 ) .",
    "this azimuthal drift gives rise to aerodynamic drag between the disks .",
    "azimuthal drag force @xmath39 per unit surface area of a particulate disk with surface mass density @xmath40 causes inward radial migration of the disk material at speed @xmath41 .",
    "this inward particle drift gives rise to mass transport at the rate m_z=2r v_r_d=. [ eq : dotmgen ] note that if @xmath39 is independent of @xmath40 then the same is true for @xmath9 .",
    "external force @xmath39 per unit area can be generally represented in the form f_=a_g+b , [ eq : f_e_decomp ] where the first term describes the coupling between the gas disk with surface density @xmath42 and particulate disk , and constant @xmath43 determines the strength of coupling .",
    "it is natural to expect that drag scales with gas density @xmath42 ; this expectation is confirmed in  [ sect : aero ] .",
    "second term @xmath44 represents forces acting even in the absence of coupling to gas disk .",
    "pr drag is an example of such force and one can easily show ( r11 ) that for pr drag @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the speed of light , @xmath47 is the efficiency of radiative momentum absorption by the disk surface , and @xmath48 ( friedjung 1985 ) is the incidence angle of stellar radiation . from equation ( [ eq : dotmgen ] ) the rate of mass transport due to pr drag alone ( when @xmath49 ) at @xmath10 is ( r11 ) m_pr&=&= [ eq : mdot_pr ] + & & 10 ^ 8 ^ -1_r . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath50 .",
    "particle sublimation at @xmath10 increases the mass of gaseous disk at the rate @xmath9 . assuming that surface density of gaseous disk @xmath42 varies on scale @xmath51 we can write that sublimation increases @xmath42 at the rate @xmath52 . at the same time , viscous spreading reduces @xmath42 at the rate @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the characteristic viscous time in the disk t_~10  ^-1 ( m_,1 ) ^1/2 , [ eq : t_nu ] assuming @xmath55-parametrization of viscosity @xmath56 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this timescale can be very short if @xmath55 is not very small .",
    "we can now describe the evolution of @xmath42 in the vicinity of @xmath10 with the following heuristic equation : = _ + -_-= ( a_g+b)- .",
    "[ eq : heuristic ] a solution of this equation satisfying the initial condition @xmath57 ( no gas disk initially ) is _ g(t)&= & ( 1-)^-1 + & & \\{-1 } , [ eq : sol ] where we used equation ( [ eq : mdot_pr ] ) and t_s= , [ eq : tau_s ] is the _ sublimation time",
    "_ @xmath58 on which the mass of gaseous disk increases if @xmath59 . from equations ( [ eq :",
    "dotmgen ] ) , ( [ eq : f_e_decomp ] ) and ( [ eq : sol ] ) the rate at which particles sublimate is = ( 1-)^-1 \\{- } , [ eq : mzsol ] and the total mass lost by the debris disk to sublimation @xmath60 can be easily obtained by integrating this expression .    the behavior of @xmath9 and @xmath60 is shown in figure [ fig : f2 ] for different values of @xmath61 , which clearly demonstrates that for @xmath62 ( i.e. as long as @xmath63 ) debris disk evolution is insensitive to @xmath61 and @xmath64 . this is because initially the disk of metallic gas is not dense enough for the drag it produces on the debris disk to compete with the pr drag  it takes certain time to accumulate enough gas mass by particle sublimation .",
    "this means , in particular , that if the debris disk starts with mass @xmath65 , which is lower than the critical mass @xmath66 , then its evolution is determined only by the pr drag and coupling to the gaseous disk is never effective  the debris disk is eroded before gas disks grows massive enough .",
    "lifetime of the debris disk is then t_pr=3   ( ) ^-1 , [ eq : t_pr ] independent of the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath54 .    in the opposite case of a massive initial disk  @xmath68",
    " evolution does depend on @xmath61 . whenever @xmath69 the action of viscosity is so effective at removing gas released by particle sublimation at @xmath10 that the gas does not accumulate there",
    ". then @xmath42 simply saturates at the constant low level , accretion rate tends to @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and disk gets exhausted on timescale @xmath72 given by equation ( [ eq : t_pr ] ) .",
    "this evolutionary path clearly can not explain the highest observed values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the case of a massive disk and @xmath73 sublimation supplies gas to the @xmath74 region faster than viscous diffusion removes it , and @xmath42 grows exponentially on timescale @xmath75 ( as long as particle disk has enough mass to provide the source ) .",
    "this means that @xmath9 also increases exponentially for @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "this runaway stops and gaseous disk wanes only when the mass of particulate disk @xmath65 is exhausted .",
    "the latter happens on the _ runaway timescale _",
    "t_runt_s(1-)^-1 ( ) , [ eq : t_end ] determined by the condition @xmath77 .",
    "clearly , @xmath78 if @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the ratio = [ eq : feedback ] is the critical parameter determining the strength of positive feedback for massive disks : if @xmath80 a particulate disk gets rather rapidly ( within several @xmath67 ) converted into metallic gas at @xmath10 , with its subsequent viscous accretion onto the wd on timescale of several @xmath54 . whereas for @xmath81 feedback is not strong enough to reinforce gas supply at @xmath10 and disk slowly evolves on timescale @xmath72 due to pr drag . as equation ( [ eq : feedback ] ) shows , runaway evolution and high @xmath9 require ( 1 ) strong coupling between the gaseous and particulate disks and ( 2 ) low viscosity .",
    "relative azimuthal motion between gaseous and particulate disks at speed @xmath82 induces _ aerodynamic drag _ between them .",
    "drag produces force per unit area of the disk ( schlichting 1979 ) f_=_^-1_g v_^2 , [ eq : aerodrag ] where @xmath83 is the gas density and re@xmath84 is a proportionality constant .",
    "there is a significant spread of opinions regarding the value of re@xmath85 characterizing drag by the turbulent flow on a smooth solid plate , with numbers ranging between re@xmath86 ( dobrovolskis 1999 ) to re@xmath87 ( goldreich & ward 1973 ) .",
    "it is also likely that a smooth plate approximation underestimates drag ( overestimates the value of re@xmath85 ) for the particulate debris disk , which does not have continuous surface and may interact with gas more like a rough plate ( schlichting 1979 ) or even as a combination of individual particles , in which case smaller re@xmath85 is more appropriate .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : aerodrag ] ) aerodynamic drag force can be written in the form @xmath88 with a== , [ eq : a_a ] where equation ( [ eq : v_rel ] ) was used . from equation ( [ eq : tau_s ] )",
    "sublimation time at @xmath89 is t_s=10 ^ 3 , [ eq : t_s_a ] where @xmath90 km s@xmath91 .",
    "the critical mass separating low- and high - mass disks ( see  [ sect : coupled ] ) is m_prt_s310 ^ 18   .",
    "[ eq : crit_mass ] the feedback parameter for aerodynamic coupling is = ( ) ^1/2 [ eq : f_a ] and depends on both the viscosity parameter @xmath55 and the strength of aerodynamic coupling , parameterized by re@xmath85 .    equation ( [ eq : f_a ] ) shows that runaway evolution with @xmath92 requires rather low viscosity in the gaseous disk , at the level of @xmath93 , and for higher re@xmath85 smaller @xmath55 is needed .",
    "viscosity is most likely provided by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which requires certain level of ionization to operate effectively . in the ideal mhd limit simulations with no net flux",
    "typically produce @xmath94 ( hawley 1995 ) .",
    "however , in our scenario gaseous disk exists in immediate contact with the particulate disk , which is observationally known to contain a population of micron size dust grains ( jura 2009 ) .",
    "mri - driven turbulence will mix some of this fine dust with the gas , lowering ionization fraction ( small grains have large surface area and are very efficient charge absorbers ) , and giving rise to the non - ideal mhd effects , e.g via the increased resistivity ( balbus 2009 ) .",
    "the latter are known from simulations to decrease effective @xmath55 substantially , down to @xmath95 or lower ( fleming 2000 ; bai & stone , in preparation ) . as a result , it is conceivable that @xmath55 in our model can be much lower than in the ideal mhd limit of mri .",
    "thus , presence of dusty debris disk in close contact with the gaseous disk can quite naturally lengthen viscous timescale @xmath54 and facilitate gas accumulation , making possible runaway evolution due to aerodynamic drag .",
    "we note that after the particulate disk completely sublimates the value of @xmath55 in the resultant gaseous disk will go up since the source of small dust particles lowering ionization has disappeared .",
    "closer to the wd , in the dust - free region @xmath96 , ionization and @xmath55 can _ always _ be higher than in the external disk .",
    "faster viscous evolution in this region ( resulting in lower @xmath42 ) may explain lack of line emission from the inner part of the gas disk ( gnsicke 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; melis 2010 ) .",
    "our calculations clearly demonstrate that compact debris disks around wds are self - destructive whenever there is strong coupling between the gaseous and solid components . adopting for illustration re@xmath97 and setting all other dimensionless constants to unity we find from equations ( [ eq : t_s_a])-([eq : f_a ] ) @xmath98 yr , @xmath99 g and that @xmath100 is needed for @xmath80 .",
    "then the typical lifetime of a massive disk with @xmath101 g ( mass of a 200 km asteroid ) in the runaway scenario ( if the viscosity is low ) is on the order of several sublimation timescales , i.e. about @xmath102 yr . according to equations ( [ eq : mzsol ] ) and ( [ eq : t_end ] ) in this case the _ maximum _",
    "@xmath9 for this @xmath65 , achieved right before the debris disk completely disappears , is max@xmath103 g s@xmath1 .",
    "these numbers agree with observational inferences ( farihi 2009 , 2010 ) quite well .    however , if positive feedback is not strong enough to drive runaway ( e.g. because @xmath104 or higher re@xmath85 ) , then @xmath105 and it takes 3 myr for the same disk to be exhausted , as equation ( [ eq : t_pr ] ) demonstrates . in this case gas surface density at @xmath10 saturates at the low level @xmath106 g @xmath107 , see equation ( [ eq : sol ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : t_pr ] ) also shows that a low - mass disk with @xmath108 g ( mass of a 20 km asteroid ) is destroyed by pr drag very rapidly , within several thousand years ( as long as the disk is optically thick to incoming stellar radiation , see r11 ) .",
    "our model of debris disk evolution naturally explains coexisting gaseous and particulate debris disks reported in melis ( 2010 ) .",
    "systems with reported ir excesses but lacking emission lines of high - z elements in gas phase may simply possess lower mass gaseous disks , which have not had enough time to develop by sublimation of solids at @xmath10 .",
    "compositional variations between different wds may also explain such systems .",
    "calculations presented in this work are rather simple and local in nature .",
    "we studied only one coupling mechanism  aerodynamic drag , while other possibilities may be available as well ( e.g. induction interaction ( drell 1965 ; gurevich 1978 ) between the mri - generated b - field in the gaseous disk and the debris disk particles ) .",
    "also , here we did not consider low surface density disks ( we use only the thin plate approximation ) , non - trivial initial radial distribution of debris surface density , fate of angular momentum lost by debris disk and absorbed by gas disk , and so on .",
    "future global models of coupled evolution of gaseous and particulate debris disks ( bochkarev & rafikov , in preparation ) will take these issues into account to provide a more accurate description of wd pollution with circumstellar high - z material .",
    "rrr is grateful to xue - ning bai and konstantin bochkarev for useful discussions .",
