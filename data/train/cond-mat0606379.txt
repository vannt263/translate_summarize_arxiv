    "in recent years , the effects of soc in semiconductor mesoscopic systems have attracted more and more attention since it plays an important role in the emerging field of spintronics ( see recent review article@xmath0 and references therein ) since the proposal of constructing an electronic analog of optic modulator using ferromagnetic contacts as the spin injector and the detector.@xmath1 many fundamental and interesting phenomena , such as spin precession,@xmath2 spin accumulation,@xmath3 spin ( polarized ) transport@xmath4 and spin hall effect@xmath5 in the systems with soc have been investigated and are under further study now . though the soc has its origin in relativistic effects , it is regarded vitally in some low - dimensional mesoscopic semiconductor systems.@xmath6    usually , two types of soc are taken into account in the investigation for systems based on a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) confined in a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "they are rashba@xmath7 and dresselhaus@xmath8 soc , which can be described by the hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , where @xmath11 is the effective electron mass and @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrix .",
    "the strengths of the two types of soc are measured in terms of characteristic wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . for some semiconductor based systems ( e.g. , inas quantum well ) ,",
    "the rashba term arising from the structure inversion asymmetry in heterostructures@xmath15 is roughly one order magnitude larger than dresselhaus term which is due to the bulk inversion asymmetry.@xmath16 moreover , the strength of rashba soc can be tuned by external gate voltage,@xmath17 and its effect on the systems has been paid more attention , particularly in quasi - one - dimensional quantum wire system .",
    "mesoscopic systems with or without external magnetic field in the presence of soc have been studied extensively.@xmath18 two years ago , two independent experiments on the ( 001)-grown n - type gaas multiple quantum well structures had been done by using a circularly polarized infrared radiation@xmath19 and the orthogonally polarized two optical harmonic pulses,@xmath20 respectively .",
    "the spin photoncurrent@xmath19 and the pure spin current@xmath20 due to resonant intersubband transitions have been observed in the absence of any external magnetic field .",
    "hereafter , for a single quantum well ( 2deg ) with soc irradiated under an in - plane linearly polarized infrared irradiation , the spin - dependent density of state ( dos ) and the density of spin polarization has been calculated , and a pure spin current has been theoretically verified for the system.@xmath21 further , a mechanism for spin - polarized photocurrent generation in a multimode quantum wire , which is due to the combined effect of the rashba soc and a linearly polarized in - plane microwave irradiation , has been proposed in the presence of a static in - plane magnetic field.@xmath22 on the other hand , the electron transport for a quantum wire under a time - varying electromagnetic ( em ) field irradiation in the absence of soc has been analyzed previously by means of the ngf@xmath23 and the scattering matrix approach,@xmath24 respectively . however , a further confined low - dimensional systems , such as a two - level quasi - one - dimensional quantum wire or quasi - zero - dimensional quantum dot with soc under the irradiation of time - dependent field have been studied rarely.@xmath22    mesoscopic two - level system ( such as a two - level quantum wire or quantum dot ) is of physically important since it has been proved to be very useful in describing many aspects of interaction between em field and the electrons confined in a heterostructure , and in application of solid - state electronic device .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to investigate the interplay effect between the soc and the applied laser filed for a two - level mesoscopic system .    in order to investigate the electronic structure and transport of a two - level quantum wire with soc under an intense laser field irradiation , in this paper",
    "we theoretically calculate the time - averaged dos and the conductance at the low temperatures for the system .",
    "the interplay effects of different laser frequency and rashba soc strength on the electronic structure and transport are investigated by using the nonequilibrium keldysh formulism ( nkf ) . through the analysis with a few numerical examples , we find some characteristics different from those for the similar systems in previous works.@xmath25    the remainder part of the paper",
    "is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model hamiltonian for our system and give the nkf straightforwardly , where the time - averaged dos and the conductance are calculated analytically . the numerical results and the discussions are shown in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper .",
    "the ngf approach has been employed in last decades to study a variety of problems beyond the linear response regime.@xmath23 meir et al@xmath26 derived a formula for the current through a region of interacting electrons using the nkf . changing the one - direction time axis into a loop with two branches ,",
    "four green s functions depending on the relative positions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the loop can be defined .",
    "they are time - ordered , anti - time - ordered and two distribution green s functions , respectively .",
    "however , only two of them are independent",
    ". we will use the approach of standard nonequilibrium keldysh eom in the present work .    consider a quasi - one - dimensional system of electrons ( a quantum wire ) in the presence of soc and an external time - dependent laser field , the model hamiltonian reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two - dimensional position and momentum vectors , respectively .",
    "the soc hamiltonian @xmath32 is generally consisted of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , while @xmath35 is the potential from the interaction of the external time - dependent laser field with electrons in the system .",
    "the electrons are confined in the @xmath36 direction by an infinite square - well potential of width @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 which can eliminate the possibility of soc due to the effective electric field coming from the nonuniformity of the confining potential.@xmath39    to investigate the effects of soc and the external field on the electron transport properties by means of nkf , we rewrite hamiltonian ( 3 ) in the second - quantized form . for this purpose , we define that @xmath40(@xmath41 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with wavevector @xmath42 and a spin branch @xmath43 [ @xmath44 and @xmath45 , or @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which is the spin branch index corresponding to spin - up and spin - down , respectively .",

    "furthermore , according to dyson equation , the coupling between the electrode leads and the wire only adds a self - energy term in the ngf , so we firstly calculate the green s function ( gf ) of the quantum wire without considering the electrode leads . in this case",

    "we assume phenomenologically that the off - diagonal electron - photon interaction mes @xmath80 as the free input parameters ( dependent of incident laser intensity ) , and thus the hamiltonian ( 10 ) becomes @xmath81 ( c^+_{k_x1\\downarrow}c_{k_x2\\uparrow}+c^+_{k_x2\\uparrow}c_{k_x1\\downarrow})\\nonumber\\\\ & + & [ \\frac{1}{2}(e^{i\\omega t}+e^{-i\\omega t})-\\varepsilon_r ] ( c^+_{k_x1\\uparrow}c_{k_x2\\downarrow}+c^+_{k_x2\\downarrow}c_{k_x1\\uparrow})\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(e^{i\\omega t}+e^{-i\\omega t})(c^+_{k_x1\\uparrow}c_{k_x2\\uparrow } + c^+_{k_x2\\uparrow}c_{k_x1\\uparrow}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & c^+_{k_x1\\downarrow}c_{k_x2\\downarrow}+c^+_{k_x2\\downarrow}c_{k_x1\\downarrow})\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen from eqs.(10 ) and ( 12 ) that the pure rashba soc induces spin - flip transitions with equal probabilities ( spin - conserving ) according to eq.(6 ) while the applied laser field may arouse unequal probability transitions for spin - flip and spin - conserving due to the interplay between the rashba soc and the field .",

    "the energy spectrum ( 7 ) satisfies the condition @xmath115 in accordance with the time inversion symmetry . however , our interest is the interplay effect of the external laser field and the rashba soc on the electronic structure and transport of the system .",

    "we believe that some of the resonance peaks in fig.2(a ) can be identified to the photon - induced transitions between subbands with different quantum numbers.@xmath129 because both spin - flip and spin - conserving transitions are modulated by the strengths of rashba soc and laser field , so it seems that the strong strength of rashba soc in the higher laser frequency case is not favorable for the transitions between subbands with different quantum numbers .",

    "particularly , the conductance difference for the two spin orientation in fig.3 is very small and consistent with the analytical prediction from energy spectrum .",
