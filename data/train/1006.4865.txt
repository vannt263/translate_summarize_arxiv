    "in their comment,@xcite greer , delaney , and fagas ( henceforth gdf ) claim that they can resolve the conundrum expressed in our paper @xcite ( referred to as i below ) , where we challenged a method ( dg ) put forward by two of them in ref .   and subsequently used in their refs .  .",
    "unfortunately , their attempt to refute our criticism of i ( a reference which gdf even omit in their bibliography list ) is based on a series of inaccuracies and statements without any support .",
    "this starts from the abstract of ref .  ,",
    "wherein gdf incorrectly state that we criticized a so - called mecs ( many - electron correlated scattering ) approach , which was not even mentioned in i , nor defined in the works that made the object of our criticism .",
    "before discussing the controversial issues in detail , we emphasize the following :    \\(i ) using the acronym mecs , gdf obviously distract attention from the fact that the ( dg ) method @xcite envisaged by us is manifestly a _",
    "variational _ one . in their `` brief introduction to the mecs approach '' ( sect .",
    "ii of ref .  ) , they completely omit to state that the _ variational _ ansatz ( namely , the minimization of the total energy in the presence of an external bias @xmath1 ) is an essential ingredient of the dg method ; in that introduction , they do not define a _ transport _ approach , but merely review well known properties of the wigner function ( wf ) @xmath2 .",
    "\\(ii ) with this acronym and `` carefully '' chosen quotations from i , by only mentioning in passing `` _ _ the variational structure of the mecs calculations performed to date  _ _ '' ( sect .",
    "v ) , without noting that _ all _ their calculations criticized in i are _ variational _ , they aim to convey the false impression that the dg method merely consists of open boundary conditions ( obcs ) expressed in terms of the wf , and that i only criticizes these wf - obcs .",
    "we stress from the very beginning that what we criticized in i is the dg _ variational _ approach as such , and in particular the wf - obcs in the _ specific _ context of that method employed to a finite cluster ; the dg approach , as any transport theory , can not be reduced to whatever boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "\\(iii ) none of the results of gdf ( their sect .",
    "iv ) were obtained within the dg method , but simply within the well - established landauer approach for an uncorrelated toy model ( gdf model hereafter).@xcite    gdf mainly claim that : our critique in i of the dg method is invalid , and they present calculations within a simple model that reproduce the conductance quantum @xmath0 . the first claim is wrong , as explained in sect .",

    "[ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "the main presumptions made by gdf to refute the criticism of i are that : ( i ) we incorrectly presumed an asymmetric injection of momentum , ( ii ) we incorrectly assumed that there is no chemical potential difference when applying obcs , and ( iii ) we appear to be confusing in the application of obcs when using either momentum or energy distributions .",
    "all these claims are wrong .",
    "to arrive at our basic eqs .",

    "( 9 ) , and , if not otherwise specified , current conservation , eq .",

    "( 19 - 21 ) , nor in the numerical results of figs .  25 , and 7 . in our wf - obcs , eqs",
    "( 5 , 6 ) , the `` momenta '' @xmath3 in the lhs and rhs are the _",
    "same_. otherwise , we should have written , e.g. , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .    to ( ii ) : this is wrong , we do assume a nonvanishing chemical potential difference ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the bias @xmath1 enters our calculations , because the quantity to be minimized of eq .",
    "( 1 ) does depend on it via @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the wave function @xmath8 obtained within the dg procedure does contain an asymmetry between the left and right electrodes for @xmath9 , and this asymmetry reflects itself in the wf at the boundaries . without this dependence , e.  g. , the quantity @xmath10 for electrons flowing from the device into electrodes displayed in fig .",
    "2 would have been zero .    to ( iii ) : by faithfully applying the dg method to well - defined models in i , we were simply faced with a _ mathematical _ problem whose solution is _ exact _ and _ unique _ within the linear response theory , and unambiguously yields unphysical results .",
    "we needed not explicitly discuss , e.  g. , the distinction between momentum and energy distributions .",
    "the numerical results presented in i , which are completely unphysical , are nothing but the results of the variational dg method , because in i we did _ nothing _ else than exactly what that method prescribes .",
    "therefore , any critique to i represents in reality a critique of the dg method itself .",
    "gdf write : `` _ _ in practice , the _ _ '' wf `` _ _ is used to constrain the momenta flow out of the electron reservoirs and into the scattering region _ _ '' ( sect .",

    "gdf do nothing else than apply the standard landauer approach to deduce the conductance [ see their eqs .",

    "the gdf calculation represents in itself a logical inconsistency hard to understand : within landauer calculations , they assume fermi distributions ( shifted in energy by @xmath13 for @xmath14 ) in electrodes , and show that the wfs ( approximately ) just look like the fermi functions already postulated . within this philosophy",

    "else than the variational dg method prescribes .",
    "consequently , the main objective of the present reply has been achieved .",
    "the problem that is really important is not whether the dg approach fails , but rather _ why _ it fails .",
    "we do not present here a comprehensive analysis,@xcite but for the benefit of a reader interested in this method , we briefly note the following . besides wf - obcs , the dg method prescribes the total energy minimization and the usage of a normalized many - electron wave function @xmath8 to describe a nonvanishing steady state current .",
    "noteworthy , both conditions refer to a _",
    "finite isolated _ system .",
    "so , within this philosophy , it could be possible to obtain a nonvanishing steady state current , i.  e. , phenomenon that is manifestly irreversible , by merely examining a cluster which is not only finite ( and even very small , cf .",
    "ref .  ) but also _ isolated _ , by imposing certain constraints at certain ( very special ) locations inside this cluster .",
    "the dg method uses _ absolutely no other information than that pertaining to a finite isolated system _ : this system is completely decoupled from the world , and there is absolutely no source of dissipation . at this point , it is important to emphasize that , basically , valid approaches to transport fall into two classes :    \\(i ) most widely used are transport theories , e.  g. , based on the keldysh negf or master equations , which also consider a finite cluster ( wherein possible electron correlations are treated within dft or more accurately @xcite ) , but this finite cluster is linked to _ infinite _ electrodes .",
    "it is this latter ingredient that accounts for irreversibility in a _ physically _ justifiable manner : the imaginary parts of the embedding ( contact ) self - energies become nonvanishing _ only _ in infinite electrodes.@xcite on the other side , that the dg approach can lead to a nonvanishing current is solely a lucky _ mathematical _ consequence : certain matrix elements of the fano operator ( not directly related to an observable with an unequivocal physical meaning , like e.  g. , the electronic number operator ) computed somewhere inside of a finite isolated cluster happen to have nonvanishing imaginary parts , a fact _ by no means _ related to a true physical dissipation .",
    "therefore , although _ by no means _ critically related with the failure of the dg method demonstrated unambiguously mathematically , we reiterate our claim of i , that imposing wf - obcs _ within _ the dg prescription is not physically justified .",
    "wf - obcs can be used , but within _ other _ approaches ( e.  g. , by solving the liouville equation for the wf @xcite ) , for which the present considerations do not in the least apply .",
    "consequence of an ad hoc mathematical constraint without a precise physical meaning , the predicted dg current ( vanishing or not ) exhibits , not concidentally , completely unphysical trends ( cf .",
    "[ sec - dg - to - gdf ] , and figs .  3 and 7 of i ) .",
    "summarizing , in this paragraph we have indicated one serious flaw of the dg method .",
    "\\(ii ) another class of transport treatments deduces the steady - state current by examining the long time ( @xmath182 ) behavior of the wave function @xmath183 at zero temperature ( e.  g. , the already mentioned t - dmrg ) or the statistical ( density matrix ) operator @xmath184 at finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite in the former , starting from @xmath185 ( in the present notations ) the many - body wave packet is monitored a sufficiently long time @xmath186 , but before the packet reaches the other end ( @xmath187 ) , since in the absence of any dissipation it will be reflected , a reversed current will appear , and current oscillations will last forever . mathematically , this amounts to derive steady - state properties ( e.  g. , electric current ) by approaching the limit @xmath188 _ first _ , and only _ then _ @xmath189 . the clear physical analysis of ref .",

    "jaynes presented quantitative considerations emerging from that principle applied to systems of very large number of degrees of freedom based on shannon s entropy for statistical equilibrium ; a steady state is not even mentioned .",
    "in a subsequent paper,@xcite cited in a later work by dg,@xcite jaynes further analyzed the time - dependent case in detail from the perspective of a single basic principle ( entropy maximization ) applied to all cases , equilibrium or otherwise .",
    "again , the case of a steady state was not explicitly considered , and consequently the issue of the correct limit order to reach a steady state within the principle of entropy maximization was not addressed .",
    "prior to the dg work , there has been attempted to recover the standard landauer results from the maximum entropy inference,@xcite and it turned out that schemes based on that principle encounter notable difficulties _ even _ if the limits @xmath188 and @xmath189 are taken in the correct order . ignoring these difficulties and without validating their variational scheme against any well - established theoretical result ( as done by us in i ) , dg put forward an approach , wherein , implicitly , the limit order is exactly _ opposite _ to the correct one : they consider a time - independent wave function @xmath8 ( amounting to take @xmath182 ) , and then ( by taking the largest cluster it can handle , which is in fact very small ) attempt to mimic the limit @xmath188 .",
    "this was the _",
