    "the energy landscape , which projects the multidimensional conformational space of biopolymers onto low dimension , has played a critical role in visualizing their folding routes @xcite . to account for the rapid , reversible folding and unfolding of proteins ,",

    "the gradient of the energy landscape @xmath0 towards the native basin of attraction ( nba ) , corresponding to the driving force , is  large \" enough that during the folding process the biomolecule does not get kinetically trapped in local minima ( competing basins of attraction ( cba ) ) for arbitrarily long times .",
    "here , @xmath1 is expressed as a function of a non - unique variable , namely , the structure overlap function @xmath2 , an order parameter that measures how similar a given conformation is to the native state . however , perfectly smooth energy landscapes are difficult to realize because of energetic and topological frustration @xcite . in proteins , the hydrophobic residues prefer to be sequestered in the interior while polar and charged residues are better accommodated on the surfaces where they can interact with water",
    ". often these conflicting requirements can not be simultaneously satisfied and hence proteins can be energetically `` frustrated '' .",
    "it is clear from this description that only evolved or well designed sequences can minimize energetic frustration .",
    "even if a particular foldable sequence minimizes energetic conflicts , it is nearly impossible to eliminate topological frustration which arises due to chain connectivity @xcite .",
    "topological frustration refers to the conflict between local and global packing of structures .",
    "both sources of frustration , energetic and topological , render the energy landscape rugged on length scales that are larger than those associated with secondary structures ( @xmath3 nm ) .",
    "thus , the free energy , projected along a 1d coordinate , is rough on certain length scale and may be globally smooth on a larger scale . under the assumption that the characteristic roughness @xmath4 has a gaussian distribution ( @xmath5 ) , the overall transition time from the unfolded basin to nba over free energy barrier @xmath6 and @xmath7 may be written as @xmath8",

    "most of the initial experiments were performed by unfolding biomolecules ( especially proteins ) by pulling on one of the molecule at a constant velocity while keeping the other end fixed @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has become possible to apply constant force on the molecule of interest using feed - back mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition , force - quench experiments have been reported in which the forces are decreased or increased linearly @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a combination of such experiments can provide a detailed picture of the complex energy landscape of proteins and rna . in all the modes ,",
    "the variable conjugate to @xmath27 is the natural coordinate that describes the progress of the reaction of interest ( folding , unbinding or catalysis ) .",
    "if there is a energy barrier confining the molecular motion to a local minimum , whose height is greater than @xmath31 , then a sudden increase ( decrease ) of extension ( force ) signifies the transition of the molecule over the barrier .",
    "a rip in the force - extension curve ( fec ) is the signature of such a transition .",
    "surprisingly , for proteins and rna it has been found that the portions of the fec between rips can be quantitatively fit using the semi - flexible or worm - like chain model @xcite . from such fits , the global polymeric properties of the biomolecule , such as the contour length and the persistence length",
    "can be extracted @xcite .",
    "single molecule pulling experiments provide distributions of the unfolding times ( or unfolding force ) by varying external conditions .",
    "the objective is to construct the underlying energy landscape from such measurements and from mechanical folding or unfolding trajectories .",
    "however , it is difficult to construct all the features of the energy landscape of biomolecules from fec or mechanical folding trajectories that report only changes at two points .",
    "for example , although the signature of roughness in the energy landscape may be reflected as fluctuations in the dynamical trajectory it is difficult to estimate its value unless multiple pulling experiments are performed .",
    "we had proposed that the power of single molecules can be more fully realized if temperature ( @xmath28 ) is also used as an additional variable @xcite . by using @xmath28 and @xmath27",
    "it is possible to obtain a phase diagram as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath27 that can be used to probe the nature of collapsed molten globules which are invariably populated but are hard to detect in conventional experiments .",
    "we also showed theoretically that the roughness energy scale ( @xmath10 ) can be measured @xcite if both @xmath27 and temperature ( @xmath28 ) are varied in single molecule experiments .",
    "the effect of @xmath10 manifests itself in the @xmath32 dependence of the rates of force - induced unbinding or unfolding kinetics . in the following subsections we first review the theoretical framework to describe the force - induced unfolding kinetics and",

    "although bell s key conjecture , i.e. , the reduction of th activation barrier due to external force , is physically justified , the assumption that @xmath39 does not depend on the load is in general not valid .",
    "in addition , because of the multidimensional nature of the energy landscape of biomolecules , there are multiple unfolding pathways which require modification of the bell description of forced - unbinding .",
    "it is an oversimplification to restrict the molecular response to the force merely to a reduction in the free energy barrier .",

    "<S> we illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loading rate or force - dependent unfolding rates . because the transition state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied , which is reminiscent of the hammond effect , it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the independence of the ts location on force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereas the ts location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic . </S>",
