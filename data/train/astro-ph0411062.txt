    "understanding the processes of transforming molecular clouds into stars is one of the main goals of the people who are working on the structure formation in interstellar medium ( ism ) . since various physical agents such as self - gravity , thermal processes",
    ", magnetic fields are playing significant roles in star formation , we are still far from a coherent and consistent picture in spite of great achievements during recent years . while the clouds in the standard model of star formation are considered to be initially in equilibrium or quasi - hydrostatic phase , some authors questions whether this important aspect is plausible according to the numerical simulations and the observations ( e.g , vzquez - semadeni at al .",
    "irrespective of which theory can correctly describe the initial state of the clouds , the next stage of evolution of the cloud is gravitational collapse .",
    "there are many studies for presenting a correct description of the gravitational collapse of the clouds , considering their geometrical shapes and the main physical factors .",
    "studies of the gravitational collapse of gaseous clouds have been started by the pioneer works of bodenheimer @xmath0 sweigart ( 1968 ) , larson ( 1969 ) , and penston ( 1969 ) who studied the isothermal collapse of spherical clouds using numerical integration of the equations and semi - analytical similarity solutions .",
    "it seems that self - similar flows provide the basic physical insights to the gravitational collapse , and may indicate the way to more detailed investigations ( shu 1977 ; hunter 1977 , 1986 ; whitworth @xmath0 summers 1985 ) .",
    "most of the previous works dedicated to study of the collapse of spherically symmetric clouds .",
    "but it is known that filamentary structures associated with clumps and cores are very common ( e.g. , schneider &  elmegreen 1979 ; houlahan &  scalo 1992 ; harjunpaa et al .",
    "also , filamentary structures are so prominent in numerical simulations of star formation that seems the formation and fragmentation of filaments is an important stage of star formation ( see , e.g. , jappsen at al .",
    "so , self - similar solutions for the collapse of a filamentary cloud were investigated , and different sets have been found ( inutsuka &  miyama 1992 ; kawachi &  hanawa 1998 ; semelin , sanchez , &  de vega 1999 ; shadmehri &  ghanbari 2001 ; hennebelle 2003 ; tilley &  pudritz 2003 ) . recently , hennebelle ( 2003 ) investigated self - similar collapse of an isothermal magnetized filamentary cloud which may undergo collapse in axial direction , in addition to radial direction .",
    "then , tilley &  pudritz ( 2003 ) extended this analysis by focusing on only the purely radial motions and obtained interesting analytical solutions able to describe collapse of an isothermal magnetized filamentary cloud with purely toroidal magnetic field .    while most of the authors assumed that the clouds are isothermal and so their self - similar solutions describe collapse of isothermal filamentary clouds , shadmehri &  ghanbari ( 2001 ) studied quasi - hydrostatic cooling flows in filamentary clouds using similarity method .",
    "although an isothermal equation of state is a natural first approximation , there are some growing evidences that precise isothermality is not expected in molecular clouds .",
    "scalo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied the likely values of the exponent @xmath1 that appears in polytropic equation of state of the form @xmath2 .",
    "kawachi &  hanawa ( 1998 ) investigated the gravitational collapse of a nonmagnetized filamentary cloud using zooming coordinates ( bouquet et al .",
    "they used a polytropic equation of state to indicate the effects of deviations from isothermality in the collapse .    in this paper",
    "we derive self - similar solutions that can describe collapse of a polytropic filamentary cloud considering magnetic effects . while in the isothermal case",
    "the radial velocity is in proportion to the radial distance and one has to choose a prescription between magnetic field and the density ( tilley & pudritz 2003 ; hereafter tp ) , we show that when the gas obeys a polytropic relation not only the radial velocity has not such simple nature but also the toroidal flux - to - mass ratio is constant during the collapse phase .",
    "the equations of the model are presented in the second section .",
    "we obtain and solve the set of self - similar equations in the third section .",
    "these solutions will be discussed in this section .",
    "in order to study gravitational collapse of filamentary magnetized clouds , we start by writing the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics in cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "we consider axisymmetric and long filament along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "thus , all the physical variables depend just on the radial distance @xmath5 and time @xmath6 . as for the magnetic field geometry , the toroidal component @xmath7 of the field",
    "is assumed to be dominant .",
    "the governing equations are the continuity , @xmath8 the momentum equation , @xmath9 the poisson s equation , @xmath10 and the induction equation , @xmath11 we also assume a polytropic relation between the gas pressure and the density , @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants and @xmath15 ( scalo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "so , we relax the isothermal approximation adopted in the previous study by tp . since we neglected the axial velocity @xmath16 , the corresponding solutions could only be applied to the regions near the middle of a filament having finite length .",
    "in the self - similar formulation , the various physical quantities are expressed as dimensionless functions of a similarity variable .",
    "the two - dimensional parameter of the problem are @xmath13 and newton s constant , @xmath17 , from which we can construct a unique similarity varaible @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the term , @xmath20 , denotes an epoch at which the central density increases infinitely .",
    "dimensionless density , velocity , gravitational potential , and toroidal component of magnetic field then be set up as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 thus , in terms of these similarity functions , the equation of state simply becomes @xmath26 .",
    "the continuity equation , euler equation , poisson equation , and induction equation become @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 we can obtain solutions of tp for the collapse of an isothermal magnetized filament , simply by substituting @xmath32 in the above equations . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : con ] ) is integrable and gives @xmath33 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : bp ] ) is automatically satisfied and one has to choose a relationship between the magnetic field and the density in order to make further progress ( tp ) .",
    "clearly , in the polytropic case @xmath34 , the continuity equation ( [ eq : con ] ) has not the simple nature of the isothermal collapse .",
    "however , from equations ( [ eq : con ] ) and ( [ eq : bp ] ) one can simply show that the toroidal component of magnetic field , @xmath35 , should be proportional to @xmath36 . on the other hand , the toroidal flux - to - mass ratio @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 ( fiege & pudritz 2000 ) . considering equations ( [ eq : sim ] ) , ( [ eq : density ] ) and ( [ eq : bphi ] ) , we can write @xmath37 as @xmath39 since the above similarity equations show that @xmath35 is in proportion to @xmath36 , the toroidal flux - to - mass ratio @xmath37 should be constant",
    ". we can consider @xmath37 as free parameter .",
    "if we write @xmath40 then we can re - write the equations as @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 equations ( [ eq : gamp ] ) , ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) describe the gravitational collapse of a polytropic magnetized filament .",
    "these equations are very similar to the equations obtained by larson and penston for the collapse of a spherical non - rotating and non - magnetized cloud ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ) and extensively investigated by hunter ( 1977 ) , shu ( 1977 ) and whitworth & summers ( 1985 ) .",
    "if we set @xmath45 , the equations reduce to the equations derived by kawachi and hanawa ( 1998 ) for the collapse of a polytropic unmagnetized filament .",
    "the aim of this paper is to solve these coupled differential equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) subject to suitable boundary condition , and interpret the solutions .",
    "when @xmath46 vanishes , all the numerators in equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) must vanish at the same time ; otherwise the equations become singular and will yield unphysical solutions .",
    "equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) have an analytical solution , @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant . in dimensional units , this solution corresponds to time - independent singular configuration .",
    "we can find a family of limiting solutions for @xmath51 . in order to obtain these",
    ", one can expand @xmath52 and @xmath53 in taylor series @xmath54 @xmath55 by substituting the above series in equations ( [ eq : con])-([eq : bp ] ) , we obtain the following limiting solutions for @xmath56 parameterized by @xmath57 and @xmath37 : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60.\\label{eq : exp3}\\ ] ] asymptotic solutions ( [ eq : exp1])-([eq : exp3 ] ) are very useful when performing numerical integrations to obtain similarity solutions starting from @xmath56 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      when similarity solutions cross the critical points , we must take extra care as for their analyticity across the critical points . in order to find the behaviour of solutions around critical point , @xmath61 , we expand @xmath52 and @xmath53 in a taylor series up to first order .",
    "detailed calculations are in appendix a. given @xmath1 and @xmath37 , we can find analytical expressions for @xmath62 and @xmath63 as functions of @xmath64 .",
    "however , note that only those points are acceptable that @xmath65 and @xmath66 . although we do nt study type of critical points in detail , when performing numerical integrations we note if the critical points are saddle or nodal ( jordan & smith 1977 ) . in general ,",
    "the critical point is a saddle point when the two gradients of eigensolutions of @xmath53 are of the opposite signs . on the other hand ,",
    "when the two gradients have the same sign , the critical point is a nodal point .",
    "we can numerically integrate equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) by a fourth order runge - kutta integrator . by using asymptotic solutions ( [ eq : exp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : exp2 ] ) for @xmath67",
    ", one can start integration of equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) at a very small @xmath68 ( e.g. , @xmath69 ) and with arbitrary value for @xmath70 for given @xmath37 and @xmath1 .",
    "also , we can integrate the same equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) backward from the critical position , using asymptotic behaviour of solutions near the critical point for an arbitrary @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we look for matchings of @xmath71 and @xmath72 at some specific point @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . this can be found by studying loci in @xmath75 plane at @xmath73 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the dependence of the similarity solutions on @xmath37 and @xmath1 .",
    "listed are the position of the critical point ( @xmath62 ) , the density at this point ( @xmath64 ) and the density at the center ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows profiles of the density @xmath71 , the radial velocity @xmath72 and the toroidal component of the magnetic field @xmath35 for different choice of @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "clearly the solutions except for the geometry and the magnetic field are equivalent to the larson - penston solution . in almost all cases , there are an inner part with approximately flat density profile and an outer region with decreasing density . since the toroidal flux - to - mass ratio @xmath37 is constant during the collapse , each curve in figure [ fig : figure1 ] is labeled by this ratio . for a fixed @xmath37 , the central density increases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the infall velocity increases and tends to an asymptotic value at large radii . of course , such large velocities are not acceptable and there must be a mechanism ( e.g. , pressure turncation ) to turncate the solutions at finite radius .",
    "however , the typical behaviour of the radial velocity of a collapsing polytropic filament is different from the isothermal collapse where the self - similar infall velocity behaves in proportion to the radial distance .",
    "also , figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows that in the inner part the toroidal component of the magnetic field @xmath35 increases , while in the outer part @xmath35 is a decreasing function of @xmath68 .",
    "this behaviour is easily understood , if we note @xmath76 .",
    "for example , in the inner part , the density is roughly constant and so @xmath77 .",
    "an interesting feature of the solutions is that the cloud is more compressed by the toroidal pinching , if the toroidal magnetic field increases .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows that the size of the inner region strongly depends on @xmath37",
    ". however , the typical behaviours of the density and the magnetic field in the outer part are more or less independent of the toroidal field .",
    "we see that the central density increases , if @xmath37 increases so that in highly magnetized filament , the inner part with flat density profile disappears and joins to the outer region . if we compare the density profiles of @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 , we see there is still a small inner region for lower @xmath79 .",
    "it simply implies as @xmath1 decreases , there needs higher level of magnetic intensity in order to affect the flat density profile of the inner part . in other words , as the cloud tends to the isothermal regime , the inner part becomes more sensitive on the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the infall velocity reduces as @xmath37 increases . while in nonmagnetic collapse",
    ", the radial velocity tends to very high value at large radii , we see that the velocity significantly reduces even at large radii in highly magnetized collapsing filament . however , the density profile in the outer region hardly depends on @xmath37 .",
    "we find this profile mostly depends on @xmath1 , so that it behaves in proportion to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 at large radii for @xmath78 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "this typical behaviour of the density is in good agreement with the asymptotic solution at large radii which is expressed as @xmath86 .",
    "behaviour of the density profile at large radii does not change by increasing @xmath37 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "this behaviour is different from previous studies .",
    "stodlkiewicz ( 1963 ) and ostriker ( 1964 ) studied isothermal equilibrium structure of an isothermal filament , which the density falls off as @xmath87 at large radii .",
    "miyama et al .",
    "( 1987 ) derived a set of self - similar solutions for an unmagnetized collapsing filament and their density structure is similar to unmagnetized equilibrium solutions , i.e. in proportion to @xmath87 at large radii .",
    "tp showed that the density profile of an isothermal collapsing filament with purely toroidal magnetic field may change at large radii depending on the level of magnetization from @xmath87 ( low magnetization ) to @xmath88 ( high magnetization ) .",
    "but we see as the cloud deviates from isothermality , these typical behaviours of the density profile at large radii change and the main parameter in shaping the profile is @xmath1 not the level of magnetization , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "considering profile of the density in outer part of the filament , we can obtain the toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "since at large radii we have @xmath89 , the toroidal field becomes @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath78 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "we discussed that the density profile at large radii is fairly insensitive to @xmath37 , and it simply implies that the scaling of @xmath35 with the radial distance in the outer part is also insensitive to @xmath37 .",
    "we can find behaviour of the ratio of the thermal to the magnetic pressures , @xmath94 .",
    "one can easily show that in our notation the ratio is @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we see that in the inner part @xmath96 , irrespective of the value of @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "but in the outer region we have @xmath97 . these behaviours of @xmath94 show that during gravitational collapse of a polytropic , magnetized filament this ratio is not constant .",
    "however , the toroidal flux - to - mass ratio is conserved during collapse phase . in isothermal regime",
    ", one can assume either @xmath98 or @xmath99 and then study gravitational collapse ( tp ) .",
    "in this paper , we have derived solutions able to describe dynamics of a collapsing , polytropic , magnetized , self - gravitating filament .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be purely toroidal , although it is the only possible magnetic configuration which can be studied using the similarity method ( see below ) .",
    "but we expect our solutions to be a good approximation , if the poloidal fields are sufficiently weak",
    ". moreover , purely toroidal field makes it easier to compare the obtained solutions with the isothermal collapse solutions as tp studied .",
    "also , the self - similar solutions of our model can be used for future numerical or analytical studies because except for the geometry and magnetization they resemble to the larson - penston solution that has been found to be in good agreement with numerical analysis ( e.g. , larson 1969 ; hunter 1977 ; foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "one may ask is it possible to extend this analysis by considering both the poloidal and the toroidal components of the magnetic field .",
    "we note that flux conservation imposes @xmath100 , which means the similarity solutions should support this scaling . however , such similarity solutions should be in these forms , according to a dimensional analysis : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "obviously , this scaling does not support the flux conservation and so , it is necessary to put @xmath103 or @xmath104 . on the other hand , hennebelle ( 2002 )",
    "explored a set of self - similar solutions for a magnetized filamentary cloud , in which the toroidal and the poloidal components of the magnetic field play significant role in the dynamical collapse of the cloud .",
    "however , his solutions describe an isothermal , magnetized filamentary cloud which undergo collapse in the axial direction , in addition to radial collapse . in his model , the slope of the axial velocity being two times the slope of the radial one at the origin .",
    "one of the major conclusions of our study is that the dynamics of a polytropic filament is different from the isothermal case .",
    "we showed that the toroidal component of the magnetic field help to confine the gas by hoop stress and this conclusion is independent of the exponent of the polytropic equation of state .",
    "most measurements of molecular clouds have difficulty resolving the inner regions of filaments and so , it is very important to understand behaviour of the physical quantities at large radii .",
    "our solutions showed that the typical behavior of the density of a magnetized polytropic filament mainly depends on polytrop index , @xmath1 , irrespective of the level of magnetization .",
    "however , the infall velocity in the outer regions strongly depends on the ratio of the flux - to - mass ratio @xmath37 .",
    "it implies to examine the profiles of molecular lines for infall velocity which may help us to understand the true nature of the filaments . while radial velocity of the isothermal model of tp has a very simple behaviour , our polytropic solutions and hennebelle ( 2002 ) model clearly present different profiles of the radial velocity similar to larson - penston solutions of collapsing unmagnetized spherical clouds .",
    "the environment of l1512 , a starless core , has been studied at high angular resolution by falgarone , pety & philips ( 2001 ) .",
    "the gas outside the dense core is structured in several filaments with a broad range of density and temperature , from @xmath105 @xmath106 for the coldest case ( @xmath107 k ) down to @xmath108 @xmath106 for the warmest ( @xmath109 k ) .",
    "it suggests that a polytropic equation of state is more appropriate for describing the thermal behaviour of filaments of this system .",
    "falgarone et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discussed that these filaments are not held either by the pressure of the h @xmath110 layer or by the external pressure .",
    "so , they concluded that the toroidal component helps confine the filaments .",
    "however , their arguments were based on the analysis of fiege & pudritz ( 2000 ) , in which the equilibria of pressure - truncated isothermal and logatropic filaments held by self - gravity and helical magnetic fields have been studied . however , it is unlikely that the filaments in ism are being truly static structures , and many numerical simulations show dynamics structures in a star forming region ( e.g. , vazquez - semadeni et al . 2005 ; jappsen et al .",
    "we think dynamics models , like what studied here , are more adequate for filamentary structures such as those in the environment of l1512 which show a wide range of density and temperature .",
    "to obtain accurate transonic solution , it is useful to analyze the behavior of the flow near the sonic point , @xmath111 .",
    "the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , are completely determined by requiring both the denominator and numerator of equations ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) to vanish at @xmath62 : @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 . in general , given @xmath64 , it is a simple matter to find @xmath62 and @xmath63 from equations ( [ eq : crit1 ] ) and ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) . after mathematical manipulation , we obtain @xmath118^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 @xmath120 ^ 2 , f=2 a d^{1/2 } , h = a^2.\\ ] ] now , we set @xmath121,\\ ] ] @xmath122,\\ ] ] in neighborhood of @xmath62 .",
