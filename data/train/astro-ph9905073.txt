    "one of the most influential factors in the shaping of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is the input of energy from supernova explosions and the subsequent development of their remnants .",
    "the long - term evolution of a supernova remnant ( snr ) is subject to both the details of the original explosion ( initial energy input , explosion asymmetries , etc . ) and the characteristics of its surrounding environment .",
    "a unique opportunity to study snrs from different initial conditions , in a wide variety of environments , is provided by the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the lmc , at a known distance of @xmath0 50 kpc  ( feast 1991 ) , allows us to circumvent galactic uncertainties in distances and absorptions , while retaining reasonable spatial resolution .",
    "taking advantage of these properties of the lmc , we have begun a systematic study of snrs in the magellanic clouds . in previous work",
    ", we have made multiwavelength studies of the colliding remnants dem l 316 ( williams et al .",
    "1997 ; paper i ) and for two snrs , n 11 l and n 86 , which show breakout structures ( williams et al .  1998 , paper ii ) .",
    "the emission of snrs at x - ray wavelengths traces both the hot gas immediately behind the shock front ( including the reverse shock , which predominates in younger snrs ) , and in some cases , that in the central cavity .",
    "for instance , cloudlet evaporation in an snr interior can raise the density of the hot gas , thus raising the x - ray surface brightness of the hot interior to observable levels .",
    "this phenomenon is an example which shows that the x - ray morphology can be a useful tool for diagnosing the physical properties of an snr .",
    "the extensive database provided by the archive of _ rosat  _  observations gives us the opportunity to study the x - ray emission of the lmc snrs as a group .",
    "a variety of x - ray morphologies are observed in lmc snrs . in this paper ( paper iii ) , we present an x - ray atlas of those snrs and discuss their respective morphologies .",
    "our next paper ( paper iv ) will discuss the x - ray spectra of these remnants obtained from the _ rosat  _  pspc .    in  2 of this paper , we will describe the x - ray dataset . in  3 , we will define categories of snrs according to their x - ray morphology , and classify the lmc snrs in terms of these categories .",
    " 4 will discuss the implications of the different morphologies , and  5 will summarize our findings .",
    "our x - ray dataset is taken from the _ rosat  _  archive , and includes all known lmc snrs for which data were available .",
    "the list of known snrs was based on the papers of mathewson et al .",
    "( 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ) with additions for newly discovered snrs as per chu et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1995 , 1997 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , as well as the recent sn 1987a . only those snrs with _",
    "rosat  _  data available are listed in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 , whereas for completeness , table 4 contains entries for the full list of known lmc snrs , based on the references above .    for most of the objects discussed in this paper , we used data from the _ rosat  _  high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "the hri is sensitive in the energy range of 0.1 @xmath1 2.0 kev , with a field of view of 38@xmath2 38 .",
    "the in - flight angular resolution of the hri and the x - ray telescope system is approximately 5@xmath1 6  ( half power diameter ; _ rosat",
    "_  mission description 1991 ) . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and to preserve the angular resolution , we binned the images to 1  pixels , then smoothed them with a gaussian of @xmath3=2 pixels , for an effective resolution of approximately 7 .",
    "images for which the resulting surface brightness was too low for ready classification were re - binned to lower resolutions until the counts per pixel were sufficient to distinguish the features of the object .    four objects , n 86 , n 120 , snr 0454@xmath1672 , and snr 0453@xmath1669 , had insufficient exposures with the hri , but did have images available from the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "the pspc has an on - axis angular resolution of @xmath0  30  and a circular field of view 2  in diameter ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "rosat  _   mission description 1991 ) .",
    "the pspc images were binned to 5  pixels and smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath3=2 pixels ; the resulting image resolutions are @xmath0 38 .",
    "the images were processed and analyzed using the iraf / pros package .",
    "table 1 lists coordinates for the snrs , and the instrument , _",
    "rosat  _   sequence number , and exposure time for each image used in this atlas .",
    "table 2 lists the background - subtracted total count rate , average brightness , and estimated x - ray size of the snr .",
    "the count rate was calculated by determining the average counts per second within the snr itself ( as identified from its x - ray morphology ) minus the background contribution estimated from a similar off - source region ; the average brightness is this count rate divided by the estimated area of the remnant on the sky .",
    "telescope vignetting is not considered to be a significant factor ; most of the observations used here were on - axis , and , at 1 kev , vignetting is less than 10% for objects up to 15off - axis .",
    "likewise , at 1 kev , mirror scattering causes about 6% of incident photons to fall outside a radius of 10 ; this effect is not expected to significantly affect the count rates or estimated resolutions given in this paper ( _ rosat  _  high resolution imager calibration report 1997 , pp . 7 , 22 ) .",
    "the count rate can be converted to an energy flux for the 0.1@xmath12.4 kev range , using an energy conversion factor ( ecf ) based on the parameters of the object spectrum ( _ rosat  _",
    "mission description 1991 ) .",
    "this flux can be converted to a luminosity , assuming a distance of 50 kpc to the remnants . for a raymond - smith plasma with a temperature of @xmath00.5 kev and an absorption column density of @xmath010@xmath4 @xmath5 ,",
    "the ecf is 0.15 @xmath2 10@xmath6 counts @xmath7 erg@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the count rate could be multiplied by a factor of 2@xmath210@xmath9 to convert it to an x - ray luminosity in erg s@xmath8 .",

    "the effective resolution of the data is plotted as a black dot in the lower right of each image ; this effective resolution is the on - axis half power diameter convolved with the gaussian smoothing of the image .",
    "table 3 lists relevant information for each image , such as the pixel size , image resolution , brightness at the lowest contour level ( in total counts per pixel ) , the @xmath3  value for each image , and the contours in @xmath3  multiples .",
    "the x - ray morphology of an snr can provide a considerable amount of information about that snr . a point ( unresolved )",
    "source may indicate the presence of a neutron star .",
    "a bright limb suggests some combination of a fast shock and a moderately dense ambient medium .",
    "bright x - ray patches may indicate that the shock is encountering ism clumps , or may result from the later evaporation of such shocked clumps in the hot interior of the remnant .",
    "snrs in which such clumps are sufficient to dominate the emission may even develop a centrally brightened x - ray morphology .",
    "our goals in this paper are to present the x - ray morphologies of the lmc snrs , classify them according to distinguishing characteristics , and attempt to explain these categories in terms of possible physical causes .",
    "table 4 lists our classifications for the lmc remnants .",
    "also listed are those snrs for which _",
    "rosat  _  data were unavailable , or were insufficient for classification .",
    "we have used the following primary x - ray characteristics in our classification :     -15pt    shell : limb is near - complete and is brighter than face    diffuse face : face as bright as shell ; limb sometimes indistinct from face    centrally brightened : center of face notably brighter than limb    peaked emission : emission dominated by central bright source of small diameter with respect to that of the entire snr    irregular : incomplete or nonexistent shell , patchy emission    in addition , we wish to include designations for secondary x - ray features within a remnant .",
    "these features are defined as follows :     -15pt    gap : region of weaker emission in near - complete shell    hotspot : proportionally small region of bright diffuse emission    bright limb : elongated bright region along shell    non - limb feature : patch of emission away from the limb    elongated extension : protrusion beyond shell limb    several earlier papers have used the substantial _",
    "einstein  _  database to classify the x - ray morphologies of snrs .",
    "mathewson et al .   ( 1983 ) identified three categories : a  limb - brightened shell , \" and a ",
    "uniform ... sometimes patchy \" distribution , which are very similar to our own shell and diffuse face categories , and a  centrally peaked \" morphology which the authors identified as corresponding to crab - type x - ray emission . in general",
    "we equate this last category with our peaked emission classification .",
    "it should be noted that the snr n 103b is listed as centrally peaked by mathewson et al . , whereas improved data place this remnant in the shell category .",
    "seward ( 1990 ) likewise categorized galactic remnants according to their x - ray morphologies as seen in _",
    "einstein  _  images ; these categories included  shell , \"  filled center , plerionic , \" and  irregular , \" with additional notes for unresolved central objects and known neutron stars .",
    "for the most part , these categories overlap with our shell , peaked emission or centrally brightened , and irregular classifications .",
    "remnants showing the sort of patchy emission which we classify as diffuse face are classified by seward as a combination of  shell \" and  filled center \" or ",
    "central ( unresolved ) object ; \" some are listed ascomposite \" remnants .",
    "the snrs showing largely shell - type emission include dem l 71 , snr 0509@xmath1675 , n 103b , snr 0519@xmath1690 ,",
    "n 132d , and dem l 316 b. two features of this group are particularly notable .",
    "the first point is that with the exception of dem l 316 b , this group is comprised of most of the younger lmc remnants .",
    "three of them , dem l 71 , snr 0509@xmath1675 , and snr 0519@xmath1690 , have balmer - line dominated optical emission .",
    "such emission typifies remnants of type ia sn , in which a collisionless shock moves into partially neutral ism ( chevalier & raymond 1978 ) , and therefore we do not expect the forbidden - line radiation which is associated with the radiative cooling region behind the snr shock ( e.g. ,  raymond & smith 1977 ) .",
    "a second point of interest is that in all of these cases , the x - ray emission is not symmetric around the shell ; snr 0509@xmath1675 and n 103b show bright limb hotspots ; snr 0519@xmath1690 and dem l 316 b have gaps breaking the symmetry of their shells ; n 132d shows not only such a gap , but also x - ray extensions pointing away from the gap itself .",
    "dem l 71 has perhaps the greatest deviation from the simple shell morphology ; the limb features two bright arcs opposite one another , and a hotspot near the center of the face of the remnant .",
    "there are a subset of lmc snrs that neither fit the simple shell - type category nor meet the criteria for the centrally brightened snrs .",
    "we label these intermediate cases as  diffuse face \" snrs .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic for this category is the presence of significant x - ray emission over the face of the remnant , without clear limb - brightening .",
    "objects in this category include the remnants snr 0453@xmath1685 , snr 0520@xmath1694 , n 49b , n 49 , snr 0534@xmath1699 , n 63a , dem",
    "l 316 a , and snr 0548@xmath1704 .",
    "there appear , in addition , to be subgroups in this category .",
    "snrs 0453@xmath1685 , 0520@xmath1694 , 0534@xmath1699 , and 0548@xmath1704 each have a relatively even distribution of surface brightness over the remnant .",
    "in contrast , the remnants n 49b and n 63a are significantly brighter to one side and have brighter hotspots along the rim . the latter morphology may in fact arise from an encounter of one side of a shell - type remnant with denser ism ; the encounter surface , at an angle to the line of sight , appears as a brighter patch on one side of the remnant .",
    "l 316 a appears to be one of these asymmetrically limb - brightened remnants , possibly due to an encounter with the neighboring remnant dem l 316 b.      to date , the only clear example we have found of an lmc snr that shows centrally brightened x - ray emission is n 206 . while the remnants n 120 and 0454@xmath1672 also seem to have central concentrations of x - ray emission , these snrs are too faint for unambiguous morphological classification .",
    "it should also be noted that many of the smaller remnants , which have particularly bright hotspots along the limb , might be mistaken for centrally brightened snrs on casual inspection .",
    "the distinguishing characteristics of the centrally brightened snrs , however , are that the peak of the x - ray emission is located away from the outer shell , as seen in both x - ray and optical emission ; and that the x - ray peak does not have corresponding emission at radio and optical wavelengths . when taken in the context of other wavelengths , these are commonly called",
    " mixed morphology \" snrs ( e.g. ,  rho & petre 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from snrs n 157b and n 158a appears to be dominated by nonthermal emission from a central small - diameter source . both of these snrs contain known pulsars ( e.g. ,  marshall et al .",
    "1998 ; wang & gotthelf 1998 ; seward , harnden & helfand 1984 ) . as the x - ray spectra of both are predominantly nonthermal ( power - law )",
    ", it is reasonable to suggest that the bulk of the x - ray emission is powered by the central neutron star .",
    "however , there does appear to be additional emission surrounding the small - diameter source in each snr .",
    "some of this emission may be attributable to synchrotron nebula surrounding the central pulsar , but some appears to be diffuse emission , possibly arising from the expanding shock front of the snr .",
    "n 158a is almost certainly such a  composite \" remnant , with a clear shell structure around the central peak ; n 157b appears to have less well - defined outer structure , and may be in transition to a composite morphology .      as always , some objects fall outside the standard categorizations . these may have unique features due to specific local conditions , or",
    "may simply be the result having reached an age when the x - ray emission is no longer sufficient to show any sort of pattern .",
    "objects in this category include the snrs",
    "n 23 , dem l 238 , dem l 299 , the honeycomb nebula , n 11l , and n 86",
    ". the elongated x - ray structure of n 23 , which follows part of the optical limb , may be an extreme case of the asymmetric limb - brightening suggested for n 49b and n 63a .",
    "dem l 238 and dem l 299 appear to have rough shell structures somewhat within the optical shells , and may be similar to dem l 316 b in representing a backfilling of shocked material .",
    "the honeycomb nebula is irregular in optical structure as well ; it is unsurprising that the x - ray emission is similarly irregular .",
    "the x - ray emission of n 11l is thought to follow a breakout of hot gas from this remnant ( paper ii ) , resulting in the unusually extended morphology .",
    "similarly , n 86 is thought to show one or more breakouts , creating an extended multi - lobed structure ( paper iii ) .",
    "the x - ray emission in an snr can be generated by several different mechanisms .",
    "the bulk of the x - rays from most snrs appears to consist of thermal line emission , with an additional contribution from thermal bremsstrahlung emission from radiative cooling of hot gas behind the shock ( ellison et al .",
    "1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "nonthermal x - rays may also be produced by synchrotron radiation at the shock front , as the shock compresses magnetic fields and accelerates relativistic electrons ( reynolds 1988 ) .",
    "if a pulsar is present , it may inject relativistic particles into its surroundings via a  pulsar wind \" , to form a  pulsar - powered nebula \" which radiates synchrotron emission ( e.g. ,   kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .    in a very young remnant , in which the supernova ejecta still dominates",
    ", the bulk of the x - ray emission arises from the reverse shock traveling back through this ejecta . later in the young remnant s development ,",
    "the reverse shock ceases to dominate the emission ; then the fast expanding shock will have the brightest x - rays along the outer rim , as the front shocks the ambient , relatively dense ism to high temperatures ( e.g. ,   raymond 1984 and references therein ) . in remnants with more powerful shocks , nonthermal x - rays",
    "will also contribute to the emission along the shock front ( reynolds 1988 ) .",
    "material within the hot interior of such snrs will be too rarefied to have sufficient surface brightness for the easy detection of x - rays .",
    "these lead to the expected  shell - type \" x - ray morphology .    as the outer shock proceeds , cloudlets in the ambient medium may be left behind when the shock passes them .",
    "these cloudlets may subsequently evaporate into the hot interior , producing detectable x - ray emission near these local maxima in the interior density .",
    "for example ,",
    "n 63a shows a bright spot in x - rays corresponding to cloudlets behind the shock seen in optical emission ( chu et al .",
    "such cloudlets may produce the sort of morphology here called  diffuse face \" snrs .",
    "when interior cloudlets are particularly prevalent , or the outer shock less prominent , this process may cause the x - ray emission to peak toward the center of the remnant , as the hot interior becomes dense enough for its emission to overwhelm that from the shock front itself .",
    "this may lead to the  centrally brightened \" morphology , as modeled by white & long ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that an intermediate form of such brightening can arise .",
    "this could range from a  thick shell , \" where x - ray emission comes from a wide band of post - shocked material , to an even distribution of emission over the remnant , to the central peaking of x - ray emission .",
    "a cartoon of these schematic stages of development is shown in figure 3 .    on a cautionary note",
    ", it should be pointed out that the  mixed morphology \" remnant structure , which includes centrally brightened x - ray emission , can be attributed to other processes than the white & long ( 1991 ) model .",
    "a competing model , summarized in rho & petre ( 1998 , and references therein ) suggests that the central emission is  fossil \" radiation remaining from the sn explosion . in this model ,",
    "the central emission is bright enough to be observable due to a high ambient density . at young ages ,",
    "the central emission is overwhelmed by that from the outer shock , but as the remnant enters the radiative stage , the interior emission comes to dominate",
    ". this model does not include clumpy emission interior to the snr , however ; the diffuse face morphology can not be explained through this mechanism , although other external factors could produce such morphologies .",
    "we can compare the schematic stages of remnant development described above to actual snr morphologies , as seen at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we can include additional data from the x - ray spectra of some objects for a more complete picture .",
    "the younger , smaller remnants , such as snr 0509@xmath1675 , snr 0519@xmath1690 , and n 103b , tend to show a clear shell - type morphology in x - rays .",
    "some of this x - ray emission does indeed appear to be nonthermal , as shown in a recent study by petre et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who found a greater tendency to have hard x - ray emission in small - diameter ( presumably , younger ) snrs than in larger ones .",
    "for some of these remnants , the hard x - ray emission appears to be predominantly nonthermal , as is reasonable for young snrs with fast shock fronts .",
    "the diffuse face category covers a wide variety of x - ray morphologies .",
    "some remnants appear to have limb - brightened emission that extends over the face of the remnant ; n 49 and n 63a are examples of this sub - category .",
    "others , such as n 49b and snr 0453@xmath1685 , have patchy emission over the entire face .",
    "these variations can plausibly be explained as a range of transitional stages , ranging from the extensions from the shell seen in n 49 and n 63a , to the more  uniform \" distribution in ( presumably ) older remnants .",
    "we would expect to find the centrally brightened snrs at the far end of this range , as the clump emission raises the central surface brightness of the remnant to the point where the interior dominates the x - ray emission .",
    "n 206 is perhaps the best example of the central brightening in x - rays , although snr 0454@xmath1672 and n 120 are also candidates . note that it is important to consider the morphologies at other wavelengths with regards to this category , as the mathewson et al .",
    "( 1983 ) classification of n 103b shows . from the x - ray morphology alone ,",
    "especially if the x - ray spatial resolution and sensitivity are poor , one may mistake an snr with a bright limb or a breakout for a centrally brightened remnant .    a loose correlation between remnant size and some of the morphological classes",
    "is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the smallest snrs are all shell - type , and the shell - type snrs are all at the lower end of the range of diameters .",
    "conversely , the remnants known or suspected to be centrally filled are all at the upper end of the range of x - ray sizes . unsurprisingly , the diffuse face remnants fill most of the range , overlapping with both shell - type and centrally filled , but concentrated between the two extremes .",
    "those diffuse face snrs still appearing to be somewhat shell - like fall neatly between the majority of shell - type and the bulk of other diffuse face snrs . while this is of course not conclusive , and suffers from small - number statistics , it indicates that the morphologies do reflect an evolutionary trend .",
    "this is strengthened by the fact that the three smallest , shell - type snrs are young enough to be ejecta - dominated ( hughes et al .",
    "the ages calculated by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) through x - ray spectral fits are less helpful for comparison , as they describe objects all in the region where the shell - type and diffuse face snrs overlap in size , but do confirm the comparative youth of these relatively small - diameter snrs .",
    "two categories do not fit well within the schematic of snr development given above .",
    "the point source dominated snrs have x - ray emission primarily arising from synchrotron radiation powered by a central pulsar , making the x - ray morphology elsewhere in the remnant difficult to distinguish .",
    "the fainter , diffuse x - ray emission from n 158a does suggest a shell , while that of n 157b is crab - like .",
    "pulsar - dominated remnants tend to be spectrally dominated , to a large degree , by nonthermal x - ray emission from the central small - diameter source , making their emission fairly distinctive .",
    "the irregular snrs may have morphologies more determined by the details of the surrounding ism than by their stage of development ; the honeycomb snr , n 11l , and n 86 are all examples of this .",
    "others such as dem l 238 and dem l 299 may be evolved to the point where most of the emission is due to backfilled clumps rather than recent shocks , while still others may simply have too low surface brightness to distinguish any but the brightest patches of the x - ray emission .",
    "one problem with morphological classification is the possibility of projection effects .",
    "remnants which are encountering spots of higher density material in the direction toward our line of sight may have areas along the face which are brightened in x - rays .",
    "these patches of emission may create a morphology which would be easily confused with the  diffuse face \" class of snrs .",
    "it is also possible that a particularly bright spot on the limb may , due to the shell curvature or poor resolution , appear to brighten part of the face as well , as with n 103b and , possibly ,",
    "n 49 .      to properly describe the structure of these snrs , we compare the x - ray morphology to the morphologies at other wavelengths .",
    "we chose examples from each x - ray morphological category , to examine in comparison with its radio and optical emission .",
    "these examples were chosen according to the availability of good radio and optical data ; in the case of the  centrally brightened \" category , as only n 206 definitely fits that class , it was chosen as the example object .",
    "optical ( h@xmath10 ) images used for this comparison were taken using the 1.5 meter telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ; smith 1998 ) .",
    "the radio images were obtained with the compact array of the australia telescope ( atca ; dickel & milne 1998 ) .    as an example of this multiwavelength comparison for a shell - type remnant",
    ", we consider the snr n 103b .",
    "the x - ray brightening seen on the western limb of this remnant corresponds to a set of bright h@xmath10  knots ( fig .",
    "while this western side of the shell is fairly well defined in h@xmath10 , the rest of the shell is optically faint . the same x - ray bright portion of the limb corresponds to a bright region in the radio image ( fig .",
    "6a ) , which shows a complete limb - brightened shell with significantly brighter emission on the western side .",
    "we use both n 49 and n 49b as comparison objects for the diffuse face category , in order to illustrate the broad range of such objects . in h@xmath10 , n 49 appears as a tangle of internal filaments surrounded by fainter diffuse emission .",
    "the brightness of these filaments roughly corresponds to the brighter regions in x - rays .",
    "the radio emission is more shell - like , without clear correspondence with the optical filaments in most cases .",
    "it should be noted that the northern spot of emission in n 49 , thought to correspond to the soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) 0525@xmath166 ( e.g. ,  marsden et al .",
    "1996 ) , has no radio or optical counterpart . a second bright spot , however , on the southeastern limb ,",
    "does in fact correspond well to a bright spot in the radio ( fig .",
    "6b ) and nearby limb - brightening in both radio and h@xmath10  ( fig .",
    "5b , 6b ) .    the h@xmath10  image of n 49b ( fig .",
    "5c ) shows little or no shell structure , having instead several patches of bright optical emission and fainter diffuse emission overall .",
    "the brightest patch of x - ray emission , on the southern limb , corresponds to one of these bright optical regions , but over the rest of the remnant the x - ray and h@xmath10  emission appear to be uncorrelated .",
    "an atca image for n 49b ( fig .",
    "6c ) does show a rough shell structure , with diffuse emission over the interior .",
    "two bright patches of x - ray emission , on the northern limb and on the eastern side of the face , are matched by similar patches of radio emission ; however , the x - ray spot on the southern limb shows no associated radio emission .",
    "n 206 was chosen to illustrate the x - ray morphological category of centrally brightened snrs . the h@xmath10  image for n 206 ( fig .",

    "we have classified these remnants according to their x - ray morphologies , into the categories of shell - type , diffuse face , centrally brightened , point - source dominated , and irregular .",
    "we suggest that the observed x - ray emission from diffuse snrs is initially generated at the shock front , where the freshly shocked million - degree gas is prominent ; this results in a shell - type morphology . as the front encounters and envelops clumps in the surrounding ism ,",
    "these clumps are shock - heated , and lag behind the snr shock as the front continues to expand .",
    "such clumps may evaporate into the interior of the snr , causing local increases in the hot gas density ; this increased density may in turn be sufficient to raise the surface brightness of interior x - rays to detectable levels .",
    "this can result in the more distributed emission of the diffuse face morphology . as the interior density rises due to clump evaporation , emission from the high - temperature central interior may become most prominent , leading to a centrally brightened x - ray morphology .",
    "substantial deviations from this schematic concept of the development of snr x - ray morphology may occur for a number of reasons . when a pulsar is present , emission from this compact object may overwhelm that from elsewhere in the remnant , creating a point - source dominated morphology . in other cases , variations in the ism local to the remnant can have a substantial effect on the remnant s development .",
    "this may in some cases result in completely irregular morphologies , while in others it may lead to specific features such as brightened regions , extensions from the shell , or gaps in the shell continuity .",
