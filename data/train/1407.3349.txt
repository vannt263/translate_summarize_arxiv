    "with the expansion of the universe , the frequency of violent events such as interaction and mergers are expected to diminish leaving a galaxy nearly isolated .",
    "the evolution of such galaxies is mainly dependent on the internal processes which are generally slow with a typical time scale of a billion year .",
    "these slow internal processes which are believed to be the dominant mechanism of evolution in the later quiescent phase of galaxy evolution , are better known as the cause of secular evolution @xcite .",
    "various non - axisymmetric features such as bars , spiral arms ( @xmath1 perturbation ) are the commonly recognized driver of this evolution . as shown by the pioneering work of @xcite , spiral arms are able to lead the secular evolution via redistributing energy and angular momentum within the galaxy such that they eventually manage to enhance the central concentration as observations indicate @xcite .",
    "an important outcome of @xcite paper is that in order to drive the evolution in the right direction ( i.e. , by angular momentum flowing outward ) , the spiral arms have to be trailing a fact that was difficult to be determined by the observations at the time .",
    "the role of bars too are now well established in this context .",
    "bars are known to grow via transferring angular momentum outward and eventually goes through the buckling instability to form a boxy / peanut bulges @xcite . apart from hosting spiral arms and bars , many disc galaxies are also lopsided ( @xmath2 perturbation ) and",
    "generally the asymmetry is prominent in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "however , the precise role of lopsided asymmetry in driving the evolution in galaxies has been little explored .    indeed , more than a third of the spiral galaxies host large - scale lopsided asymmetry @xcite , see @xcite , for a discussion of the threshold of lopsidedness .",
    "some of the mechanisms that are shown to generate lopsidedness in the outer galaxy are : cooperation of orbital streams to a lopsided pattern @xcite ; response of an axisymmetric disc to a lopsided dark halo @xcite ; satellite infall onto a galaxy @xcite ; a tidal encounter @xcite ; asymmetric gas accretion @xcite or through internal disc instabilities @xcite .",
    "no unique mechanism for generating lopsidedness has been identified so far , and it could well be that a combination of different processes is at work .",
    "further , it has been shown that for isolated galaxies , the amplitude of lopsidedness is uncorrelated with the strength of tidal interaction @xcite or the presence of nearby companions @xcite .",
    "whatever might be the origin , both the stellar distribution @xcite and the neutral hydrogen gas distribution in the outer parts @xcite of a galaxy are known to be lopsided .",
    "the strength of lopsidedness , as measured by the fractional fourier amplitude of the @xmath2 component is , on average , comparable to that of the @xmath1 component as seen in spiral structure and bars @xcite . despite this ,",
    "surprisingly , the dynamical effects of lopsidedness on galaxy dynamics and evolution have not received much attention .",
    "being a prominent asymmetry in the outer parts , lopsidedness can produce torque the way bars and spirals do in the inner regions , and redistribute angular momentum in the galaxy .",
    "but the direction and detailed mechanism of this angular momentum transport has not been studied yet in detail , and we note that it will depend crucially on several factors such the underlying mass distribution , pattern speed , and overall whether the lopsidedness is trailing or leading .    determining the sense of rotation in a galaxy has been a long - standing challenge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spiral arms ( @xmath1 ) are typically believed to be trailing on theoretical grounds because this facilitates outward transport of angular momentum @xcite and very recently alma shows clear evidence of a trailing spiral feeding the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 1566 @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of a lopsided ( @xmath2 ) mode , when the sense of rotation can be determined at all , it seems to be leading , that too in the inner parts as in m31 @xcite . in eso 297 - 27 ,",
    "the inner single arm leads while an outer three arms are trailing @xcite .",
    "there is also the reverse case when the outer two - armed pattern leads while the inner one - arm trails as in ngc 4622 @xcite .",
    "thus while there is some evidence for lopsidedness being leading in the inner parts , it needs to be confirmed whether it is leading or trailing in the outer parts .",
    "the current paper focuses on the issue of angular momentum flow due to a lopsided perturbation in a disc galaxy .",
    "we follow the treatment of @xcite to derive the total torque which is a sum of gravity torque and advective torque ( also known as lorry transport as dubbed by @xcite ) imparted by a lopsided perturbation on the outer disc .",
    "we show that angular momentum flow in a pure exponential disc gives rise to unphysical result , namely that the sign of angular momentum flow changes abruptly at a transition point which corresponds to the point where @xmath3 , the kinematic precession frequency of a lopsided mode changes from being retrograde to prograde .",
    "however , the inclusion of a dark matter halo sets the angular momentum flow in the outward direction as necessary for disc evolution , provided lopsidedness is leading in nature .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the primary model for the disc and halo that we consider .",
    "section  [ sec : dispersion ] contains the calculation of the dispersion relation for the lopsided modes .",

    "analytic density profiles are employed to obtain the potential and other dynamical parameters . the galactic cylindrical co - ordinates @xmath4 are used throughout .",

    "[ 3 ] .    in order to keep it simple and",
    "highlight the primary results from this work , we restrict ourselves to a particular model for which we have presented all the calculations here . for the stars , we have used @xmath31 m@xmath10  pc@xmath11 and @xmath32  kpc  implying a total stellar mass ( @xmath33 ) of @xmath34  m@xmath10 .    for the gas distribution",

    "the reason for choosing a lower value for the @xmath14 is that we wanted the total gas mass to be less than @xmath41% of the chosen total stellar mass so that the disc does not go unstable .",
    "however , since we are not worrying about the stability of the total disc , these values are arbitrary at the moment but agree with the range of typical values seen in a galaxy .",
    "the flattening and core radius of the dark matter halo are fixed at @xmath42 ( considered to be nearly spherical , for simplicity ) and @xmath43 ; the central density @xmath44  m@xmath10  pc@xmath45 . the circular velocity curve for this stars+gas+dark matter halo configuration",
    "is shown in the upper panel ( solid black line ) of fig  [ fig : kinematiclop ] . in order to have a falling rotation curve and",
    "study its effect on the kinematic description of lopsidedness , we have made minimal changes in the halo configuration e.g. , decreased @xmath46 to @xmath47  m@xmath10  pc@xmath45 ( roughly by a factor of @xmath48 ) ; the corresponding circular velocity is shown by the dotted line in the upper panel of fig  [ fig : kinematiclop ] .",
    "the falling rotation curve we have considered ( with a gradual fall of @xmath49  kms@xmath50 over @xmath49  kpc ) is reasonable - e.g. , our own galaxy shows this @xcite which also helps explaining the high amplitude of hi flaring seen in the outer parts @xcite .",
    "the lower panel of fig . 2 will be explained in section  [ sec : dispersion ] .",
    "we consider both the stellar and gas disc initially axisymmetric and embedded in an axisymmetric oblate dark matter halo whose density distribution are as mentioned in previous section .",
    "we treat both the stellar and gas disc in the outer part of a galaxy as cold self - gravitating fluid disc with velocity dispersion ( @xmath51 ) being much less than the local circular velocity ( @xmath52 ) i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "when such a disc is subject to a lopsided ( @xmath2 ) perturbation of the form @xmath54 , we can write the density , potential and velocities in the galactic plane as    @xmath55 + @xmath56 + @xmath57 + @xmath58 + here the circular frequency @xmath59 and the perturbed surface density and potential are connected via the poisson equation as    @xmath60    then the linearized equations of hydrodynamics namely the euler and continuity equations can be written as : @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    in the above equations @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the epicyclic frequency in the disc . for a stellar fluid , the self - consistent derivation of anisotropic stress tensor can be done only for special cases , because of the closure problem @xcite .",
    "although @xcite derived a set of dynamical equations for the anisotropic pressure assuming circular motions , a general solution and interpretation remained unclear . for our calculation",
    ", we consider a polytropic equation of state , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ( also called an isothermal equation of state ) and @xmath68 constant throughout the disc@xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation for the gas disc where various observations indeed indicate that the gas velocity dispersion remains nearly constant with radius and does not depend on the local unperturbed mass density @xcite but not for the stars which are better described by a polytropic index @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "since lopsidedness is mostly prominent in the outer parts of a galaxy where stellar density drops down significantly ( so does the velocity dispersion as @xmath70 ) , we , to a zeroth order approximaton , applied the same isothermal equation of state to describe both the components .",
    "we shall discuss the impact of this simplified assumption on the angular momentum transport in the following section .    then writing the perturbed variables in terms of fourier",
    "transform as @xmath71 and substituting them back in the equations of motion , the perturbed planar velocity field ( i.e. , radial and azimuthal ) can be written in a compact form :    @xmath72    with @xmath73 and @xmath74 and the matrix @xmath75 is given by ,    @xmath76    in the above equations , @xmath77    and @xmath78    then writing the radial part of the perturbed quantities as @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the phase and using a wkb approximation @xcite , we have the following dispersion relation for @xmath2 lopsided perturbation    @xmath81    where the wavenumber @xmath82 .    for trailing perturbation @xmath83 , while it is positive for a leading case .",
    "note that the general form of the dispersion relation remains unchanged for any fluid described by a polytropic equation of state except the fact that the velocity dispersion depends on the local surface density and polytropic index ( as discussed above ) .",
    "the dispersion relation will be useful later in deriving angular momentum transport under the wkb limit . in absence of self - gravity and pressure of the perturbation",
    ", the slow m=1 lopsided pattern would precess with a frequency @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematiclop ] , we show the free precession frequencies for @xmath2 and @xmath1 perturbations in a cold exponential disc",
    ". it was lindblad who first showed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) that for an @xmath1 spiral arm to survive in a disc with strong differential shear , the radial variation of @xmath85 should be nearly zero and this condition is nearly satisfied in the region around the peak of this curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematiclop ] ) .",
    "in fact , in most spiral galaxies , the spiral arms are contained within the inner parts of the optical radius or about two disc scale lengths , taking the optical disc to be about @xmath86 disc scale lengths @xcite .",
    "we employ a similar analogy to suggest that lopsidedness should be preferentially seen in the outer parts of a galaxy . for the exponential disc , the differential precession i.e.",
    ", the value of radial derivative of @xmath87 , rapidly increases below @xmath88  scale lengths .",
    "however , beyond this radius , the radial variation of @xmath87 flattens out and becomes almost close to zero .",
    "this turns out to be an ideal situation for the @xmath2 lopsidedness to naturally avoid the differential shear . in general",
    ", a naturally favourable situation for the lopsidedness to survive would be where the circular velocity falls as one goes outwards .",
    "this occurs in a keplerian case as in a disc around the central black hole , this case will be studied in a future paper .",
    "but lopsidedness is observed in galaxies with a flat rotation curve too . for a flat rotation curve , @xmath89 and",
    "the pattern frequency becomes @xmath90 in which case , the differential shear becomes non - zero .",
    "then inclusion of self - gravity helps as shown previously by @xcite",
    ". basically , self - gravity tries to reduce the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath65 so that there is a net reduction in the radial variation of @xmath91 .",
    "the situation gets more favourable when the net circular velocity falls off moderately in the outer parts and one such case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematiclop ] in which case the differential precession is much lower compared to the galaxies with flat rotation curve .",
    "however , even with the inclusion of global self - gravity , the preferred region for lopsidedness seems to be the outer parts of a disc , as the differential shear in the inner region is too strong @xcite .",
    "there is another physical reason for lopsidedness to be seen mainly in the outer region since the self - gravity of the disc resists any distortion of type @xmath2 inside of about 2 disc scale lengths ( jog 1999 , jog 2000 ) as shown by a self - consistent disc response to an imposed potential .",
    "the exponential disc by itself can support kinematical lopsidedness for a long time as seen from the near constancy of @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematiclop ] ) . while addition of the dark matter halo changes this constancy such a way that the disc plus halo system is not so supportive of the @xmath2 mode ( unless the halo is such that the overall rotation curve is falling in nature ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of the dark matter halo makes it possible to allow a smooth outward transport of angular momentum without any radial break and hence is a dynamically preferred state as shown in the subsequent section .",
    "in the following , we compute the torque due to a lopsided perturbation imposed onto the disc .",
    "we assume that the lopsided perturbation is stationary and not growing .",
    "the disc has no net inflow / outflow of matter from outside / inside i.e. , mass conservation is strictly followed .",
    "in addition , we assume that the dark matter particles do not take part in the angular momentum transport i.e. , these particles neither gain nor lose angular momentum ; the halo is considered here as a simple potential bath .",
    "following @xcite , we write the torque exerted by an @xmath2 lopsided perturbation on the disc material outside a given radius @xmath93 as    @xmath94    note that the above integrand is second order in perturbed quantities .",
    "there is no torque on the disc to first order .",
    "we evaluate the gravitational torque in the wkb limit ( using tightly wrapped potential perturbation ) with @xmath95 given by @xmath96}\\ ] ] .    then the resulting expression for the torque",
    "is given by    @xmath97    where @xmath98    at large distances from the centre of a disc",
    "i.e. , in the outer parts @xmath99 .",
    "note that the gravity transport of angular momentum depends primarily on the square of the perturbing potential and sign of the phase variation of the perturbation .",
    "as is well known , only the trailing spiral ( @xmath100 ) ( or any m - fold non - axisymmetric perturbation ) can exert positive torque on the outer parts and transport angular momentum outward .",
    "the same is , of course , true for the m=1 lopsided perturbation i.e. , the gravity torque due to a trailing lopsided perturbation induces outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "however , gravity torque alone does not tell the full story of angular momentum flow in galaxies .",
    "below we discuss another mechanism of angular momentum transport proposed by @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the presence of a steady non - axisymmetric perturbation , stars away from resonances neither gain nor lose angular momentum . but these stars nevertheless help transporting angular momentum just as a system of lorries - a mechanism worked out by @xcite who named it the `` lorry transport '' . according to them , in the presence of a trailing perturbation , stars with very small eccentricities",
    "gain angular momentum near their apocenters and lose it all near their pericenters . in this sense ,",
    "lorry transport of angular momentum by such stars opposes gravity transport of angular momentum .",
    "however , the net advective flux of angular momentum can have either sign when derived over a distribution of stars .",
    "now , the total advective torque due to a lopsided perturbation can be calculated either following the original derivation of @xcite or using the fluid equations following @xcite which we intend to use in the present paper . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the advective torque in both ways and show under what condition they are equivalent .    considering a simple two - integral distribution function ( df ) , the advective torque due to @xmath2 perturbation can be written as @xcite :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is a given radius within which we calculate the torque",
    ", @xmath103 is the average epicyclic amplitude with @xmath104 denoting the average epicyclic energy . then writing @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the pattern speed of a lopsided mode and using the properties of modified bessel function , we have    @xmath107    in the longwave limit @xmath108 , the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath109 term and in that case it can be shown that the advective torque is given by a rather simple formula :    @xmath110    note that the original derivation for the advective torque by @xcite has a typographical error ; in that the term @xmath111 should be in the denominator as it is in eq .",
    "[ eq : lorrylbk ] ( lynden - bell 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "now , we shall derive the advective torque under the fluid approximation .",
    "we begin by writing    @xmath112    note that the net torque is again second order in perturbed quantities . substituting the perturbed velocities and carrying out the @xmath113-integral",
    ", we have    @xmath114    @xmath115 sign indicates the complex conjugate . substituting @xmath116 and @xmath117 from eq .",

    "[ eq : cadvec1 ] and using @xmath121 which we shall use interchangibly , it is possible to write the advective torque in a more familiar form :    @xmath122    note that in the limit @xmath123 , we have    @xmath124    the above equality which holds in the limit @xmath123 implies that we basically have a pressure - less stellar fluid .",
    "the two - integral df assumed by @xcite also amounts to saying that the stars in epicyclic motion form a pressure - less cold self - gravitating system . from now on , we shall use eq .",
    "[ eq : cadvecfl2 ] to further deduce the value of advective torque . utilizing the dispersion relation given by eq .",
    "[ eq : dispersion ] , we can write eq .",
    "[ eq : cadvecfl2 ] as    @xmath125    eq .",
    "[ eq : cadvecfl3 ] is worth examining .",
    "apart from the wavelength of the perturbation , it depends on the underlying mass distribution and the perturbing potential . in general , for a disc galaxy we have the inequality @xmath126 satisfied over a wide range of potential variation from @xmath127 to @xmath128 respectively .",
    "then it follows in a straightforward way that for a general galactic potential , in the presence of any m - fold slowly rotating non - axisymmetric perturbation with @xmath129 , @xmath130 within the disc , where @xmath131 .",
    "this holds true as well for a wide range of self - gravitating astrophysical discs as @xmath132 always with @xmath129 .",
    "however , the scenario changes for @xmath2 ; in which case , one could , in principle , have either situation i.e. , @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "as we discuss in detail in section 5 , the exponential discs in galaxies happen to manifest this intriguing situation .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences for the dynamical evolution of galaxies as shown here .",

    "[ eq : lzdot ] is our working formula to compute the angular momentum transport .",
    "apparently , neither gravity torque nor advective torque explicitly depends on the velocity dispersion of the system as we have used the dispersion relation given by eq .",
    "[ eq : dispersion ] to remove the explicit dependencies .",
    "however , the torque depends on the wavelength of the perturbation ( @xmath139 ) or the pitch angle ( @xmath140 ) which are , of course , related to the velocity dispersion of the system .",
    "it is trivial to see that the net magnitude of torque will change by changing the pitch angle of the lopsided perturbation .",
    "but it is not clear what is the pitch angle for any lopsided perturbation ; it does measure how tightly wrapped a lopsided perturbation is .",
    "for simplicity , we shall use @xmath141 corresponding to a wkb limit of @xmath142 which crudely represents a logarithmic variation of the phase angle .",
    "although , this is really pushing the wkb limit to a stage where it is not valid any more , as is often said , it might nevertheless give a good insight into the problem .    in order to proceed further ,",

    "guided by various observations @xcite , we use the following radial profiles for the lopsidedness in the disc :    @xmath144    @xmath145 is the halo perturbation parameter and the linearly rising part of @xmath146 arises as a result of self - consistent response of the disc to halo perturbation @xcite",

    "one of the purposes of this paper is to explore the parameter space and various disc - halo configurations to understand the flow of angular momentum in disc galaxies - which , in turn , is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies . in the following section ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a slowly rotating lopsided perturbation and discuss briefly here the @xmath1 case just for the purpose of illustration .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the long - wave limit , the net torque ( gravity+advective ) , calculated in our full model of stars+gas+dark matter , beats the gravity torque alone by a factor of @xmath160 depending on the amplitude of the @xmath1 perturbation ( a fact that had been suspected in the original paper by @xcite ) . for stars alone",

    "an absence of a strong ilr is desirable to complete the feedback loop required for the swing amplification @xcite through which these perturbation might actually grow .",
    "so we consider a small prograde pattern speed for the lopsidedness so that the corotation is placed at very large radii in the disc .    in this limit",
    ", we have @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] , we show that the radial variation of this parameter @xmath119 which appears to play a pivotal role in deciding the direction of angular momentum transfer due to advective mechanism in galaxies .",
    "it is clear from the figure that for a pure exponential disc , the parameter @xmath119 flips its sign from positive to negative at a radius of @xmath166 , which we call as the _ transition radius _ , denoted as @xmath167 .",
    "this transition corresponds to when @xmath65 the epicyclic frequency , falls below @xmath168 the angular speed . for a self - gravitating disc ,",
    "this may seem counter - intuitive since for most realistic rotation curves @xmath65 is @xmath169 .",
    "however , such a situation can occur for example , for highly centrally concentrated ( or super - keplerian or steeper than keplerian ) mass distributions , including an exponential disc as shown here .",
    "interestingly , a number of mass distributions such as the toomre s model  n , or a gaussian density distribution , which are widely used in modelling astrophysical discs also possess a transition radius ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "these cases are given in the appendix , and their implications are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1j ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1 ] , we show the angular momentum transport by the @xmath2 lopsided perturbations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfa1a2 ] , first , for an exponential disc distribution .",
    "as can be seen from these figures , the gravity torque alone is negative at all radii when the @xmath2 lopsidedness is trailing .",
    "it is interesting to note that the advective torque is dominating the gravity torque roughly by a factor of @xmath161 and oppose the gravity torque ( unlike the @xmath1 trailing case ) .",
    "however , sign of the net torque ( advective+gravity ) flips exactly at the transition radius of the exponential disc .",
    "the presence of a transition point hampers the smooth angular momentum flow in the disc  irrespective of whether it is trailing of leading .",
    "this , in turn , might lead to an unfavourable situation for the evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , such a situation can only be completely eliminated if we add sufficient amount of gas in it and/or embedded the disc in a dark matter halo as discussed below .",
    "if we include a reasonable amount of cold gas in the disc ( say 10 - 15% ) - as seen in late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the transition radius , @xmath167 changes from 4.6@xmath6 to about 5.1 @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : d1 ] ) .",
    "this is not because of any physical property such as dissipation related to the gas component per se but because of the gas distribution that is taken to fall slower than that of stellar distribution here as observed ( see eq .  2 ,",
    "section  [ sec : model ] ) . if we were to add more gas , say more than 20% by disc mass , then we do not have the transition radius any more in the disc .",
    "but gas fraction higher than 20% is not likely since that would make a disc highly unstable to the growth of gravitational instabilities @xcite .    the transition point is also avoided when the disc is embedded in a dark matter halo . in either case , the net @xmath65 exceeds @xmath168 and hence the transition point is avoided ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] ) . in the presence of a dark matter halo that gives rise to a flat rotation curve ,",
    "we get @xmath170 at all radii ( where @xmath52 is constant correspnding to @xmath171 ) ; the same holds true even when the rotation curve is moderately falling ( see fig  [ fig : kinematiclop ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] ) which arises when use the other dark halo model with central density @xmath172 . adding some amount of gas",
    "makes @xmath173 to be slightly higher than 1 ( for the case with @xmath52 constant ) .",
    "these findings have significance for the slow evolution of galaxies as discussed next .    the net transfer of angular momentum due to an @xmath2 trailing lopsided pattern in an exponential stellar disc with gas and our full model with the dark matter halo ( with @xmath174 ) having a flat rotation curve",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1j ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1 ] .",
    "the lopsided perturbation used in deriving these figures are the same as in the first two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : surfa1a2 ] .",
    "as discussed below , the basic facts of angular momentum transfer do not change appreciably whether we use either models of @xmath137 .",
    "both these figures indicate that the net transfer of angular momentum in the presence of a dark matter halo giving rise to a flat rotation curve is enhanced roughly by a factor of @xmath175 over that due to stars+gas alone .",
    "note that a dark matter halo explicitly affects the advective torque by changing the free precession frequency ( @xmath91 ) of the slow lopsided perturbation . decreasing the amount of dark matter in the galaxy",
    "reduces the value of @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] ) and hence the net torque also reduces . in other words , in a disc galaxy with a falling rotation curve ( in our case , one with @xmath172 ) , the net outward flow of angular momentum will be slower ( approximately by a factor of 3 compared to the other dark halo producing the flat rotation curve ) and the process will be slowest or inefficient in the limit where dark matter halo is totally absent . in such an extreme case , the disc alone is barely stable against local perturbations and a non - responsive dark matter halo is shown to be crucial to ensure local disc stability @xcite as well as to prevent global bar - like instability @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a rigid dark matter halo in our picture has the effect that it removes the transition point in the galaxy and the total torque is positive at all radii for the trailing lopsided perturbations we consider here i.e. , the disc within @xmath176 gains angular momentum . in other words , the inclusion of a reasonable dark matter halo reinforces the angular momentum to flow inwards if the lopsidedness is trailing . if this is allowed , such perturbation can not last long and can not drive the galaxy evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if galaxies are to evolve by maximizing entropy , the angular momentum has to be transferred outward  demanding that _ lopsidedness has to be leading in nature .",
    "_    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1m2 ] , we show that indeed it is the leading lopsided perturbation which can drive the angular momentum flow outwards as the trailing @xmath1 perturbation does , albeit less vigorously in the inner regions . note that for @xmath1 , the final peak of the net amt occurs approximately at a region where @xmath177 has its maximum .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the second term for @xmath1 in the square bracket in eq.[27 ] is nearly flat in the inner few scale length followed by a gentle rise in the outer parts of the disc where @xmath154 falls sharply to zero  when multilied the net peak is basically determined by the @xmath154 .",
    "for @xmath2 , the second term is a smoothly rising function right from the center and @xmath146 is also rising but reaching its peak after @xmath178  @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modela1]) when multiplied the net peak occurs before @xmath178  @xmath6 .",
    "in essence , the peak of amt is basically determined by the radial variation of the perturbation and the second term in square bracket in eq .",
    "( 27 ) which largely determines the advective transport . for the kind of perturbations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surfa1a2 ] ) we have used , the net torque due to the @xmath1 trailing perturbation is an order of magnitude higher than @xmath2 leading perturbation within @xmath161 disc scale length . on the other hand , in the region beyond @xmath179  scale length , the torque due to the @xmath2 leading perturbation dominates and about @xmath180 times higher than that due to @xmath1 trailing wave .",
    "it is trivial to see that by increasing the peak amplitude of @xmath146 by a factor of 2 , we would increase @xmath181 roughly by a factor of 4 ( see eq .",
    "[ 27 ] ) . while the peak strength of the torque due to @xmath2 ( seen in the range @xmath182 ) is a few times smaller than due to @xmath1 ( seen in @xmath183 )",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lzdotm1m2 ] ) , the crucial point is that in the outer parts , it is the @xmath2 perturbation that provides the channel that leads to the ourward amt .",

    "the structure of a spiral galaxy is such that the inner region is dominated either by a bar and/or spiral arms and generally the outer part is dominated by lopsided asymmetry .",
    "there might be a deeper reason for such a configuration to exist in nature .",
    "following @xcite , and a large amount of research by a number of authors @xcite , the important role played by a bar and spiral arms in galaxies has now been understood .",
    "both a bar and spiral arms help in evolving an initially axisymmetric disc galaxy by redistributing energy and angular momentum so that the disc reaches a state of minimum energy configuration .",
    "the end product of this process is a growing central concentration or a pseudo - bulge formation @xcite .",
    "however , often this process requires gas to flow inwards .",
    "plenty of observations suggest that galaxy accretes gas from outside either as a smooth infall - as shown by extended gas filaments as in ngc 891 @xcite , or via satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also see the recent review on gas accretion by @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also indicate that galaxies accrete gas along cosmological filaments @xcite . the importance of both @xmath2 and @xmath1 modes in driving gas inflow has been stressed previously by @xcite . but",
    "details about the angular momentum transport by @xmath2 has not been worked out . as we understand now , unless there is a positive definite torque acting on the gas ,",
    "it is hard for an inflow to occur in the first place or there has to be other mechanisms at work .",
    "we show that lopsidedness can act as a bridge between the stellar disc and the cosmic filaments which are a reservoir of cold gas .",
    "this galactic leading @xmath2 mode is a machinery behind bringing gas to the edge of the stellar disc from where the gas inflow is taken care of by the spiral arms and bars .",
    "this is in compliance with the fact that the strength of lopsidedness decreases as one move inward towards the galactic center where generally @xmath1 dominates .",
    "we show using arguments similar to lindblad , that on kinematic grounds , the outer parts of an exponential disc are susceptible to an @xmath2 mode",
    ". however , this has a transition point which marks the change of sign of amt in the disc .",
    "this is removed if the disc is embedded in a dark matter halo so that the net @xmath65 dominates over @xmath168 at all radii and an outward flow of angular momentum occurs smoothly at all radii , if the lopsided mode is leading .",
    "this gives a deeper meaning to the role played by the ubiquitous @xmath2 modes in shaping or restructuring galaxies .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 mode bridges the gap between the gas accretion from filaments onto the outer galaxy to transport to the inner galaxy . inside the optical disc ,",
    "the spiral arms take over as the main driver of amt .",
    "thus @xmath2 in the outer parts and @xmath1 in the inner parts together allow the secular galaxy evolution to proceed in a meaningfull way .",
    "the @xmath2 leading and @xmath1 trailing modes can be thought of as collaborators in a relay process where the @xmath2 mode facilitates gas infall up to about half the optical radius , inside of which the @xmath1 takes over as the agent that allows gas infall .",
    "thus together these modes cause an outward amt and allow a smooth secular evolution of a typical galactic disc .",
    "this then is the deep physical reason for the existence of @xmath2 mode , analogous to what @xcite had shown @xmath1 to be a mechanism that structures spirals within the inner optical disc .",

    "interestingly , the other typical disc mass distributions such toomre s model  @xmath184 ( as used e.g. , by @xcite and others ) , and a gaussian distribution as seen in the hi in some galaxies @xcite also require a dark matter halo to have a smooth flow of angular momentum ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "surprisingly , the power - law mass distributions that are often seen as bare systems as in pre - stellar regions @xcite do not exhibit such a transition region and hence do not have a discontinuity in the outward amt , which may explain why such bare systems can exist .",
    "conversely , an exponential or a gaussian radial mass distribution can not exist as bare discs without the cushioning of a dark matter halo that removes the transition point .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the angular momentum transport mediated by a slowly rotating lopsided asymmetry due to the standard or gravity torques as well as the lorry or advective torques . in particular , we work out the lorry transport of angular momentum in considerable detail to understand the role played by the ubiquitous lopsided perturbation in driving evolution in lopsided disk galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    we show that in the long - wave limit , the magnitude of advective torque due to a lopsided perturbation dominates over the gravity torque and opposes the angular momentum flow due to the gravity torque unlike the case of an @xmath1 perturbation .",
    "we show that in an exponential stellar disc with or without cold gas , there is a transition point at which a kinematic lopsided perturbation changes from retrograde to prograde .",
    "we show that there are other mass distributions e.g. , toomre s model  n , gaussian distribution , for which this is also true .",
    "it is shown that in the presence of a transition point , the net angular momentum flow due to a lopsided perturbation is hindered in such a mass distribution .",
    "we then explicitly show that in the presence of a dark matter halo such a transition point is uplifted , allowing a smooth flow of angular momentum in the disc . in a typical lopsided galaxy , where an exponential disc is embedded in a dark matter halo ,",
