    "previous studies of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 have been limited to pure surfaces in vacuum @xcite , an unrealistic environment for the study of corrosion .",
    "these studies indicated that the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals are localized on the chromium ions , suggesting that the oxygen - terminated surface could provide a stable barrier against acidic chlorinated environments _ if _ the surface oxygen layer could be prevented from reacting with species in the solution .",
    "the work below puts forth evidence to support the novel hypothesis that the dielectric screening effects associated with an aqueous environment actually prevent the formation of bonds with aqueous species such as protons , thereby rendering the oxygen - terminated surface virtually non - reactive .",
    "models for calculating solvation energies from continuum dielectric theory@xcite have been applied to single molecules or activated complexes but not to molecules adsorbed on surfaces , perhaps because such methods are generally applied to molecules . here",

    "the size of the surface cell and time - scales needed for proper thermodynamic averaging make a direct molecular dynamics treatment of the aqueous environment infeasible , thus raising the question of how to treat the solvent .",
    "this work takes the novel approach of exploiting the existence of so - called `` classical '' density - functional theories@xcite , which can treat water rigorously in terms of a simple thermodynamically averaged molecular density and an approximate functional@xcite .",

    "the localization of different spin types to either surface corresponds to the fact that the oxygen atoms on each surface have opposite net spin direction .",
    "next , the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) overall appear as an @xmath42-hybrid chromium band ( from @xmath40 - 2  ev to @xmath400  ev ) consisting of electrons of `` majority '' spin , spin aligned with the net atomic spin .",

    "same conventions as figure  [ fig : tdos].,width=336 ]    upon relaxation of the physisorbed chlorine surface in the presence of the solvent , we find there to be very little relaxation ( no more than 0.01  for any atom ) , little difference in the total charge density ( figure  [ fig : cldensvac]b ) , no change in the presence of partially filled states at the fermi level ( figure  [ fig : elevels]c.2 ) , and very little difference in the local density of states ( figure  [ fig : cldos ] ) or the spatial distribution of the hole injected into surface , figure  [ fig : clhomolumo]b .",

    "the presence of a dielectric solvent has very little effect on the pristine surface or on its interaction with chlorine , while it has a dramatic affect on the interaction with hydrogen . in vacuum",
    ", hydrogen readily forms an o - h bond with the outermost layer of atoms of the surface . in the presence of water , the strong screening associated with dielectric effects in the vicinity of the proton ( ultimately via hydrogen bonding interactions ) so weakens the attractive potential of the proton that the covalent bond is broken , the electron is released into the surface and the proton solvates .",
    "in contrast , the interaction with chlorine in vacuum is already ionic , with a neutral chlorine atom having sufficient electronegativity to draw an electron from the bulk of the crystal and thus ionize to cl@xmath47 while injecting a hole into the bulk .",
    "the presence of a dielectric solvent tends to screen the excess charge on the chlorine ion , thereby only further stabilizing this form of interaction with the surface so that there is little change in this case when going from vacuum to a dielectric environment .",
    "it thus appears that the primary reason why the solvent has a much greater effect on the interaction with hydrogen than with chlorine is that a dielectric environment generally favors the formation of ions and the surface interaction with chlorine is already ionic whereas the interaction with hydrogen in vacuum is covalent .",
    "we believe that there would be little effect on these conclusions were the calculations to be performed with ions rather than atoms .",
    "doing so would involve principally removing a single electron from the calculation for each hydrogen atom or adding an electron for each chlorine atom .",
    "for the chlorine cases , this would simply remove the relatively delocalized hole from the bulk chromium band and thus likely have little effect on the final results . for the interaction with hydrogen , the removal of an electron would ,",
    "in the dielectric case , simply remove the relatively delocalized donated electron or , in the vacuum case , likely simply introduce a relatively delocalized hole into the chromium band . in either of these cases for hydrogen , we again would expect little disruption of the chemical integrity of the surface .",
    "overall , a novel picture emerges to explain how the oxygen - terminated surface of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 is particularly protective in a hydrochloric acid solution .",
    "the outer oxygen layer provides a natural barrier to interaction with chlorine but might be expected to interact strongly with protons .",
    "however , through dielectric screening effects , it is the aqueous environment itself which eliminates the outer oxygen layer s natural tendency to interact with hydrogen .",
    "these first calculations of surface chemistry in the presence of a solvent make clear the need for additional work to complete the picture of the passivating effects of chromium oxide .",
    "we would next like to study the interaction of chlorine and hydrogen with a _",
    "chromium_-terminated surface , whose homos would then be exposed on the surface rather than protected under the outer oxygen layer .",
    "we also would like to explore pit corrosion by calculating the interaction of the aforementioned species with a step in the passivating oxygen layer .",
    "finally , we would like to contrast the interactions of chlorine in such systems to the interactions of fluorine and bromine in order to better understand the corrosive success of chlorine relative to these other species .",
