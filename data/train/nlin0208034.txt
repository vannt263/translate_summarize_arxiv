    "the interest in the correlation between classical periodic orbits , and in particular , in the spectrum of their actions , emerges from the attempts to provide a semiclassical proof of the universality of spectral correlations of quantum chaotic systems (  the bgs conjecture \" @xcite ) .",
    "action correlations were first discussed by argaman _",
    "_ were the universality of action correlations , and their relation to random matrix theory ( rmt ) were studied for a few chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the subject were investigated later @xcite .",
    "this culminated recently in the work of sieber and richter @xcite , who identified pairs of correlated trajectories , whose contribution to the spectral form factor for systems with time reversal symmetry is identical to the next to leading order term in the formfactor predicted by rmt ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , to review the semiclassical context where action correlations and their expected universal features arise in a natural way @xcite .",
    "this will be done in the main body of the present section , where also the connection with rmt will be made explicit .",
    "second , to test the general semiclassical arguments on action correlations for a paradigm chaotic dynamical system - the baker map .",
    "this system was investigated previously by a number of groups , @xcite , who demonstrated numerically the existence of the expected correlations . here",
    ", we develop another approach for the analysis of the action spectrum , where we try to systematically asses the way the periodic orbits and their actions can be partitioned to families which are dynamically related .",
    "one aspect of this approach is studied by casting the problem as an ising model ( in one dimension and with a long range , yet exponentially decaying interaction ) . moreover , we show several features of the action correlations which escaped the attention of previous works , and in particular , we analyze the correlations in terms of the symbolic dynamics .",
    "we hope that this insight will pave the way to a more complete understanding of the universal features of action correlations in general .",
    "consider a finite , two dimensional domain @xmath0 and an area preserving map @xmath1 any area preserving map can be expressed implicitly through a generating function @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 .",
    "the generating function @xmath3 defines the map through the relations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is to be expressed in terms of @xmath6 by solving the first equation , and @xmath7 is given explicitly using the second equation .",
    "twist maps are maps for which the first equation above has a unique solution for any @xmath8 . from now on we shall assume @xmath9 to be a _ hyperbolic _ twist map .",
    "periodic points of period @xmath10 are solutions of the equation @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath10-periodic orbit is obtained by iterating the map : @xmath12 the _ action _ assigned to a periodic orbit is @xmath13 the number of @xmath10-periodic orbits , @xmath14 increases exponentially with @xmath10 .",
    "the object of our investigations is the set of actions @xmath15 , in the limit @xmath16 .    under quite general conditions one can show that the mean action @xmath17 and the variance var@xmath18 are both proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the actions of @xmath10-periodic orbits are bounded within an interval which grows @xmath19 with @xmath10 . however",
    ", since their number grows _ exponentially _ with @xmath10 , one expects exponentially small spacings between successive actions .",
    "we shall explain now why the pair correlations of action are expected to be universal , and determined by rmt . to this end",
    "we should address the quantum analogue of the map , in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the quantum analogue of the classical map , is a unitary evolution operator @xmath20 which acts on a @xmath21 dimensional hilbert space , with @xmath22 , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 $ ] stands for the integer value and @xmath24 is the area of @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath20 consists of @xmath21 unimodular complex numbers @xmath25 .",
    "ample numerical evidence supports the conjecture that the spectral statistics of @xmath20 , is well reproduced by the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "the quantum spectral density is denoted by @xmath26    in the semiclassical approximation , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is a discrete index which labels the eigenstates of the position operator and @xmath3 is the classical generating function .",
    "a detailed discussion of the semiclassical evolution operator and its properties can be found in @xcite .    the semiclassical approximation ( [ sclsmatrix ] ) yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the set of @xmath10-periodic orbits .",
    "@xmath31 are the stability amplitudes @xmath32 here , @xmath33 stands for the repetition number if the periodic orbit is a repetition of a primitive @xmath34-periodic orbit @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the monodromy matrix and @xmath37 is the maslov index for the primitive orbit .",
    "at this point we introduce the _ classical _ density of actions of @xmath10-periodic orbits , @xmath38 and we obtain @xmath39 using ( [ eq : nnn ] ) , and measuring the actions in units of the phase space area @xmath40 , we get the relation between the quantum and the classical densities : @xmath41 this equation expresses the quantum - classical duality .",
    "it relates two densities which are very different : the quantum density gives a unit weight to all the eigenphase on the unit circle , while in the classical density , the actions are weighted by the stability amplitudes , and are assigned with a  charge \" @xmath42 depending on the maslov index .",
    "the duality relation is expressed via a fourier transform which involves both the variables and the parameters which specify the quantum and the classical distributions . on the quantum side",
    ", @xmath21 is a _",
    "parameter _ which specifies the value of @xmath43 , while @xmath10 is the value of the variable conjugate to @xmath44 . on the classical side",
    ", @xmath10 is a _ parameter _ which specifies the period of the ensemble of orbits under consideration , while @xmath21 determines the value of @xmath45 - the variable conjugate to @xmath46 . in the sequel we shall always reserve the first position to the spectral variable or its conjugate , while the second position is reserved to the parameter which specifies the system .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the spectral formfactors , which are the fourier transforms of the pair correlation functions .",
    "the quantum and the classical formfactors are given explicitly as @xmath47 where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the mean density and @xmath50 must be an integer since @xmath51 is a periodic function .",
    "the classical formfactor is , @xmath52 it follows from ( [ eq : dualdual ] ) that the quantum and the classical 2-point formfactors are related by @xmath53 hence , the quantum spectral correlations are reflected in the classical spectrum , and _",
    "vice versa_. this equation expresses the important semiclassical result that the quantum formfactor is obtained from the classical one by interrogating the spectrum of action differences on the scale of @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : kkduality ] ) has to be understood in the sense of distributions , since the formfactors , as defined above , are the fourier transforms of a sum of @xmath55 functions .",
    "indeed , the formfactors computed for a given system , fluctuate , and do not converge to a limit when @xmath56 . the appropriate way to overcome this difficulty in the present context is to apply a smoothing procedure , which enables the extraction of well defined limit distributions .    starting with the quantum formfactor",
    ", we adopt _ spectral averaging _ which is based on the assumption of  spectral ergodicity \" .",
    "we order the spectrum so that @xmath57 , and partition it to @xmath58 subsets @xmath59 , each consisting of @xmath60 subsequent phases . neglecting correlations between phases in different subsets ,",
    "we rewrite ( [ eq : qmff ] ) as @xmath61 @xmath62 is the formfactor for the spectrum obtained by multiplying all @xmath63 by @xmath64 so that they cover uniformly the entire circle .",
    "taking now the limit @xmath56 at a constant @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , it is expected that @xmath67 , which is expressed now as an average over the ensemble of the partial formfactors , converges to a limit distribution @xmath68 which reproduces the prediction of rmt for the appropriate ensemble .",
    "this procedure is justified by the fact that in the quantum spectrum , the _ correlation range _ is of the order of a mean spectral spacing .",
    "hence , the elimination of the correlations between different sets in ( [ eq : qmffsmoo ] ) introduces a small error , which vanishes in the large @xmath21 limit .",
    "a different smoothing procedure is required for the discussion of the classical spectrum . as will be shown in the sequel ,",
    "the classical correlation length is of order of the _ inverse _ of @xmath69 which exceeds by far the mean spacing which is exponentially small in @xmath10 .",
    "a spectral smoothing should therefore rely on a different partitioning of the period orbits , such that the relevant correlations are preserved within a subset , while members of different subsets are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "one of the main problems in dealing with the classical correlations is the proper definition of such subsets @xcite .",
    "the smoothing of the classical spectra is by far more important since the number of actions increases exponentially with @xmath10 .",
    "if we denote the results of the quantum and the classical smoothing procedures by @xmath70 , we obtain from ( [ eq : kkduality ] ) the relation which is basic to the present approach , @xmath71 assuming that @xmath72 follows the rmt predictions , namely , @xmath73 , we find that the classical spectra of chaotic systems must display universal pair correlations which can be derived from rmt using the relation ( [ eq : basiduality ] ) . in particular , since for large @xmath21 , @xmath74 is a function of @xmath65 only , we derive two immediate predictions for @xmath75 :    _ ( i ) _ @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath10 , since the _ rhs _ of ( [ eq : basiduality ] ) must depend on @xmath21 only through the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath77 where the proportionality of @xmath75 to @xmath10 is made explicit .    _",
    "@xmath78 depends on @xmath45 only through the scaled variable @xmath79 , @xmath80 since @xmath45 is the parameter conjugate to the action differences , it follows that the correlation length of the action spectrum is proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq : scaling ] ) shows that the classical correlations of actions corresponding to different periods are identical up to a scaling , and universal , since they are expressed in terms of a system independent function .",
    "these predictions pertain exclusively to classical properties and , once they are derived within classical mechanics , the road would be cleared for a semiclassical derivation of the bgs conjecture .    the validity of _",
    "( i ) _ in the limit @xmath82 was first shown by m. berry @xcite . in the present context",
    ", it follows from the fact that the actions are discrete variables , and therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath21 the only correlations are the diagonal ones . hence , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of different orbits which share the same action ( mostly due to symmetry ) and the summation is now restricted to trajectories with different actions .",
    "the equality on the right hand side is derived by using the ergodic sum - rule @xcite and denoting by @xmath86 the average value of the @xmath85 . since @xmath86 takes the value 1 for systems without time reversal symmetry , and 2 for systems which are symmetric under time reversal , the leading terms in the rmt results for the cue and coe are indeed reproduced .    to derive the quantum formfactor in a consistent semiclassical way",
    ", one has to consider the classical formfactor for a fixed @xmath10 , and change @xmath45 ( or @xmath21 ) so that an interval of @xmath65 values is scanned .",
    "however , to have meaningful pair correlations , @xmath21 should be larger than 2 , and therefore the range of allowed @xmath65 values , is at most @xmath87 .",
    "a further restriction on the range of @xmath65 is due to the limited semiclassical accuracy , which is of the order of a mean spacing , @xcite . in other words",
    ", the semiclassical trace formula may have its poles away from the unit circle , thus replacing the sharp @xmath55 functions in ( [ eq : qmdens ] ) , by spikes with a finite width , of the order of the mean spacing .",
    "therefore , the regime @xmath88 is not expected to be accessible to the semiclassical approximation , and thus , the range of applicability reduces further to the domain @xmath89 .",
    "it is important to note at this point that the required order of operations ( keeping @xmath10 fixed and taking @xmath90 ) is consistent with the correspondence principle and the rules of quantum mechanics where the limit @xmath91 is taken at a fixed value of the classical parameters .    in the present work we shall study the baker map , which will be introduced in the next section .",
    "it is a simple dynamical system , for which various properties can be derived analytically , yet it carries the full complexity of the action spectrum , and therefore it is appropriate as a paradigm . in section ( [ sec : density ] ) the spectrum of the actions will be discussed from various points of view , and on the different relevant scales .",
    "the expression of the actions in terms of the symbolic codes of the periodic orbits will play a central role .",
    "mapping the computation of the spectral density onto an ising model enables us to introduce a few approximations which enable the derivation of some properties of the action density ( [ sec : ising ] ) .",
    "the classical pair correlations are discussed in section ( [ correlations ] ) .",
    "we study first the @xmath92th neighbor distributions .",
    "we show numerically that as long as @xmath92 is smaller than the action correlation length @xmath93 measured in units of the mean action spacing , the @xmath92th neighbor distributions are essentially poissonian .",
    "turning to the formfactor , we discuss alternative smoothing methods and relate them to the symbolic codes .",
    "we finally show that the classical correlations reproduce the expected rmt behavior as was conjectured in the general discussion presented above .",
    "we conclude the paper by a summary , where the connection between the present and previous works is discussed .",
    "the _ baker _ map is one of the most simple examples of chaotic maps  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "it is an area preserving map of the unit square onto itself defined by @xmath94\\hspace{3 mm } ; \\hspace{3 mm } y'=\\frac{1}{2}y+\\frac{1}{2}[2x]\\ ] ] the stretching in the @xmath28 direction and the squeezing in the @xmath95 direction are responsible for the hyperbolic character of the map , while the `` cutting and putting on top '' gives the mixing property .",

    "the phase space coordinates of a @xmath10-periodic point can be written in term of the code @xmath102 as @xmath103 periodic points fill phase space densely and uniformly .",
    "the symbolic dynamics introduced above is based on the partition of the unit square into two equal rectangles along the line @xmath104 .",
    "the sequence of binary symbols indicates the order by which the orbit visits the rectangles .",
    "alternative codes can be generated by partitioning the unit square along the lines @xmath105 , with @xmath106 integer , and @xmath107 .",
    "a symbolic code consisting of the @xmath108 symbols @xmath109 indicates the order by which the periodic orbit visits the rectangles .",
    "the translation of a binary sequence to the @xmath108 code is done by considering successive sequences of @xmath110 binary symbols as integers in @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "( example , the binary code @xmath112 is translated to the @xmath113 code @xmath114 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath110 the code becomes more informative , because it locates the rectangles with an accuracy @xmath115 along the @xmath28 axis .",
    "however , this is achieved at a cost : not all sequences of symbols are allowed .",

    "we examine whether the classical actions spectrum exhibits correlations , and whether these correlations conform with the semiclassical theory which was presented in section ( [ introduction ] ) .",

    "they exhibit _ level repulsion _ as predicted by @xmath298 i.e. the probability to find two nearest neighbors at distance @xmath55 vanishes as @xmath299 .",
    "we have already hinted in section ( [ introduction ] ) that the pair correlations in the action spectrum is expected on a scale which is much larger that the mean spacing .",
    "we shall perform the analysis of pair correlations in several steps . in the first we shall examine the correlations on the scale of the mean level spacing .",
    "we shall show that the @xmath92th nearest neighbor spacing distribution are consistent with the corresponding poisson distributions , as long as @xmath92 is smaller than the correlation length measured in units of the mean spacing .",
    "we shall then study the formfactor of the pair correlation function , and compute it in various ways .",
    "the main result of this investigation is that the correlations exist , and their scaling with @xmath10 agrees with the semiclassical expectations .",
    "the @xmath92th - neighbors spacing distribution @xmath300 , is a straight - forward generalization of the widely used nearest neighbors spacing distribution . to define this distribution , the action spectrum",
    "is ordered so that @xmath301 , degeneracy sets are represented by a single value and the spectrum is normalized by the nearest neighbor spacings @xmath302 then , @xmath300 is the probability that @xmath303 takes the value @xmath304 .    as a reference spectrum we generated numerically a poissonian spectrum .",

    "fig : nndist ] .",
    "the nearest neighbors distribution , @xmath305 , for @xmath168 is plotted together with the random ( poissonian ) nearest neighbors distribution .",
    "the similarity between the two distribution , which persists over 6 orders of magnitude , provides strong evidence in favor of the claim that on the mean spacing scale , the action spectrum is statistically random .",
    "this finding is further corroborated in the lower frames of figure  [ fig : nndist ] .",
    "were the spacing distributions for @xmath306 are compared with the corresponding random distributions .",
    "to go even further in @xmath92 , we studied numerically the summed distributions @xmath307 which approximates the two point correlation function @xmath308 in the range @xmath309 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pnnm_n19 ] .",
    "shows @xmath310 for @xmath311 , ( @xmath168 ) together with the corresponding random distributions .",
    "these values @xmath312 should be compared with the correlation length expected to be of order @xmath313    this numerical investigation clearly demonstrates that the systematic deviation between the random and the actual distributions increases as @xmath312 approaches the correlation length .      the purpose of the present section is to study the formfactor of the classical action spectrum ( [ eq : clff ] ) .",
    "we start by investigating alternative methods for averaging the formfactor , the need for which , and the difficulties involved , were discussed at length in section ( [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we shall study the function @xmath78 ( [ eq : kcal ] ) , and in particular test whether the action spectrum of the baker map , satisfies either of the equivalent relations @xmath314 since the baker map is invariant under time reversal , the appropriate rmt expression is the one for the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) @xmath315 , where the factor @xmath316 in the argument is due to the invariance of the baker map under the @xmath216 symmetry . the explicit expression for @xmath317",
    "is given by @xmath318    before applying any averaging , the function @xmath319 displays strong fluctuations which are shown in figure [ fig : ktaur1 ] . for @xmath320 together with the expected coe result .",
    "the large fluctuations make the comparison quite meaningless , and the figure is shown to emphasize the need of averaging .    using the running average : @xmath321 the large fluctuations are reduced , and the curve labelled  periodic orbits \" in figure [ fig : ktaucoe ] .",
    "is the running average obtained by computing the formfactor from the set of @xmath322-periodic orbits .",
    "the agreement with the corresponding coe curve persists up to @xmath323 .",
    "the line marked  diag \" is the curve obtained by assuming that the actions are not correlated , and it agrees very well with the line marked as  rand \" which was computed for the random set of actions ( see section ( [ nndistribution ] ) ) .",
    "the difference between the data and the random curves is a clear indication of the presence of correlations , whose similarity to the predicted coe result goes beyond the leading  diagonal \" approximation .",
    "the running average procedure is not satisfactory , because it is practical only for low values of @xmath10 . as @xmath10 increases",
    ", the number of periodic orbits proliferates exponentially , and the fluctuations in the formfactor grow as rapidly . moreover",
    ", this method does not help to unravel the dynamical origin of the correlations .",
    "a systematic averaging procedure , which can be applied for any @xmath10 , uses the concept of families which was introduced in section ( [ subsect : fam - codes ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of actions of @xmath10-periodic orbits is partitioned to families at the @xmath110th level with labels @xmath213 ( see ( [ eq : pcode ] ) ) .",
    "as long as @xmath110 is sufficiently small such that @xmath115 is larger than the correlation length , only _",
    "family correlations are important .",
    "the formfactor can be approximated by an incoherent sum over the formfactors which pertain separately to orbits within one family .",
    "@xmath324 each family of actions is supported on an interval of size which decreases with @xmath110 as @xmath115 . hence from the requirement",
    "@xmath325 we deduce @xmath326 , and the range of values of @xmath65 which can be described by this method is bounded from above by @xmath327 .",
    "thus by increasing @xmath110 , we gain a higher level of smoothing , but we lose on the range of @xmath65 where this method can be used .",
    "the resulting formfactors for @xmath320 and @xmath328 are shown in figure [ fig : ktaucoef ] .",
    "it shows that the smoothing gets more effective as @xmath110 increases , without appreciable loss of correlations in the interval @xmath329 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the spectral correlation length is @xmath330 , which is smaller than the family separation of @xmath331 for the values @xmath328 .",
    "a closer comparison of the @xmath239 and @xmath332 curves near @xmath333 shows that the deviations from the rmt prediction starts earlier for the @xmath332 data . to investigate this trend further , we use the @xmath231 partitioning ( [ eq : qcode ] ) which is more convenient from the numerical point of view .",
    "it allows us to extend the level further , and the data for @xmath334 is shown in figure [ fig : ktaucoef45 ] . since now the family range is smaller than @xmath81 , the correlations can be studied only on a lower range of @xmath65 value .",
    "this , and similar other numerical investigations provide strong evidence in support of the @xmath81 dependence of the correlation length , in agreement with the semiclassical expectations .",
    "as was commented previously , the partition into families breaks pairs of @xmath216 conjugate orbits .",
    "hence , the rmt expression which is used in figures [ fig : ktaucoef ] . , [ fig : ktaucoef45 ] . is @xmath317 and not @xmath315 which is used for the comparison with the full data set .",
    "the ising model approach ( [ sec : ising ] ) offers a complementary view of the formfactor . as was explained in ( [ sec : ising ] ) , the truncation at the @xmath110th level does not allow us to distinguish between actions which are within @xmath115 , and counts them as if they are degenerate .",
    "thus , the only way by which we can get spectral information on the scale of @xmath81 in this model is to use @xmath110 such that @xmath335 .",
    "the spectral correlations are now studied as correlations _ between _ degeneracy groups , rather than _ within _ a group .",
    "figure  [ fig : ktaumod ] . shows the average of a few form factors , corresponding to values of @xmath10 from @xmath322 to @xmath336 , given by the model with @xmath293 which satisfies the criterion above .",
    "the average over @xmath10 reduces the fluctuations of the form factor so it is possible to compare it directly to the @xmath298 .",
    "the fact that the action spectrum is resolved with an accuracy of @xmath115 sets a lower limit to the values of @xmath65 which are accessible by the model , which is @xmath337 .",
    "this is why the low @xmath65 values in figure [ fig : ktaumod ] .",
    "are absent .",
    "the semiclassical predictions which were presented in section ( [ introduction ] ) were checked in detail and were found to be well satisfied for the baker map .",
    "they consist of the following main points :    * the action spectrum show pair correlations which are universal and consistent with the predictions of the semiclassical theory and rmt . *",
    "the correlation length is of order @xmath338 which exceeds the mean spacing by a factor which grows exponentially with @xmath10 .",
    "the spectrum of actions is poissonian on smaller scales . *",
    "the correlations can be associated with families of periodic orbits which have a similar dynamical structure which can be associated systematically with their symbolic codes .",
    "various aspects of these points were confirmed for other systems @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite are unique , because the phase space of the mapping considered is four dimensional , and the semiclassical theory predicts that the action correlation range scales with @xmath10 as @xmath339 .",
    "this scaling was confirmed .",
    "richter and sieber @xcite pointed out the pairs of periodic orbits which provide the correlations which are necessary for the second order term in the small @xmath65 expansion of the formfactor .",
    "these orbits spend about half of their time quite close to each other , and the rest of the time , they go along the time reversed part of their partner s orbit .",
    "this way both orbits visit the same parts of phase space , but the order by which they do it is different .",
    "similar pairs were also proved to provide the answer in the case of quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "the families which we identified here as storing the correlations between the actions are of the same nature , but of a more general character .",
    "they do not rely exclusively on pairs conjugated partially by time reversal ( as explained above ) , but by the requirement that the correlated members spend the same amount of time in the same sub domains of phase space .",
    "this definition of families is also consistent with the work of @xcite , where the periodic orbits in a family follow the same segments of phase space which were related to each other by symmetries other than time reversal .",
    "because of the strong link between phase space partition and symbolic codes , it was possible to characterize the families by a common code . unfortunately , even with this tool , we were not able to derive the classical correlation function using classical arguments only .",
    "this remains an enigma which should be addressed . at the same time",
    ", one should also be able to show that the spectrum of actions on smaller scales is poissonian .",
    "this is assumed , but not discussed in @xcite and in @xcite .    in the present article we focussed our attention on discrete maps and their periodic orbits",
    ". however , most system of interest are hamiltonian flows , where the time is a continuous variable , and the quantum spectrum is on the real line and not on the unit circle .",
    "this does not pose any essential problem , since several quantization techniques make use of an auxiliary map to derive the quantum energies , and it was shown that for chaotic systems , the spectral statistics of the energies and of the eigenphases of the auxiliary map are the same in the semiclassical limit @xcite . a more direct approach was recently introduced in @xcite , where the quantization of the hamiltonian flow is carried out in terms of a quantum map which evolves the system along a sequence of equally spaced times @xmath340 .",
    "the semiclassical expression for the spectral formfactor is analogous to ( [ eq : duality ] ) , and the periodic orbits have periods which are integer multiples of @xmath341 and their energies are restricted to a well defined energy interval .",
    "integrable dynamics lead to poissonian spectra @xcite . in the present context",
    "this implies that the actions are poissonian too @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown in @xcite that in order to account for finer spectral correlations which are due to the spectrum being pure point , finer correlations must exist , but this discussion exceeds the scope of the present paper .",
