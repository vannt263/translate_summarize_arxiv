    "generation of spin - polarized current is of significant importance both scientifically and technologically .",
    "a spin - polarized current would emerge naturally from ferromagnetic materials . in order to achieve a spintronic device , it is important to find non - magnetic materials where a spin - polarized current can be flowed without becoming depolarized .",
    "it has become possible to induce and detect spin polarization in non - magnetic semiconductors@xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that graphene@xcite field effect transistors@xcite based on armchair nanoribbons can be used to generate spin - polarized currents .",
    "the conduction electrons in carbon - based materials can move very long distances without scattering due to their small spin - orbit coupling and low hyperfine interaction .",
    "recently magnetic effects using graphene edges states of an armchair ribbon have been explored@xcite . in our work",
    "we investigate bulk magnetic properties of a one - dimensional electron gas of armchair ribbons , where electrons interact via long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "it is possible that a ferromagnetic state may be stable in such a system as the investigation of one - dimensional hubbard model with nearest neighbor electron - electron interaction suggests@xcite .",
    "graphene armchair ribbons@xcite have several special properties that are well suited for spintronic applications . according local density approximation ( lda )",
    "when the width of an armchair ribbon is @xmath6 or @xmath0 a gap exists in the energy spectrum @xcite ( a rather small gap exists when @xmath7 , and this case will not be considered here ) .",
    "the other property is that boundary condition on the armchair edges admix @xmath4 and @xmath5 valleys , and eigenstates are mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states forming one - dimensional subbands@xcite ( this is in contrast to parabolic and cylindrical potentials@xcite , where the mixing is rather small ) .",
    "when the system is doped electrons occupy these subbands and a one - dimensional electron gas forms , see fig.[fig : splitting ] .",
    "the other unique property is a rather small value of the dielectric constant ( @xmath8 ) , which makes effects of coulomb interaction effects strong .",
    "many - body self - energies are thus one order of magnitude larger in comparison to the corresponding values of an electron gas of ordinary semiconductors with @xmath9 .",
    "( circles ) and @xmath0 ( squares ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath2 is an integer . the effective mass approach is used . here",

    "the average spin value per carbon site is shown as vertical arrows ( only spins of electrons belonging to the lowest conduction subband are shown ) .",
    "( b ) phase diagram as a function of the fermi energy @xmath13 for the length of ribbon @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath13 is measured from the bottom of the conduction subband .",
    "f ( p ) stands for ferromagnetic ( paramagnetic ) state .",
    "( c ) phase diagram for @xmath1.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this work we assume that a gap separates conduction and valence subbands , and that , among conduction subbands , only the lowest energy conduction subband is occupied with electrons .",
    "we calculate the many - body exchange self - energy @xmath14 of a spin - polarized one - dimensional electron gas of such a system for relatively large values of the width @xmath15 , where the lda and ema results agree approximately ( see sec.ii ) .",
    "the width dependence of @xmath14 is shown in fig.[exchse ] . using these results",
    "we find that , for ribbon widths @xmath0 , a critical point separates ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states while paramagnetic state is stable for @xmath1 .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig.[phase ] .",
    "this dependence on the width can be understood by examining the wavefunction overlap that appears in the expression for the exchange self energy .",
    "the effect is a consequence of eigenstates that have a subtle width - dependent mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "the large difference in the values of dielectric constants of graphene and ordinary semiconductors can not explain these width - dependent magnetic properties .",
    "of undoped graphene is shown .",
    "lda results@xcite for widths @xmath6 ( filled circles ) , @xmath0 ( filled squares ) , and @xmath16 ( filled triangles ) .",
    "ema results for the same widths are open squares , circles , and triangles.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    effective mass approach can describe numerous physical properties of graphene approximately .",
    "it can be derived from tight binding method@xcite .",
    "fig.[dft ] displays the value of the gap of armchair ribbons as a function of the width .",
    "both lda@xcite and ema results are shown for _ undoped _ armchair ribbons .",
    "we see that the lda values of the magnitude of the gap are in rough agreement with those of the ema results , and the agreement becomes better for larger values of @xmath17 .",
    "however , there are several deviations .",
    "the ema value of the gap is zero for @xmath7 while that of lda is small but non - zero . also as @xmath17 changes between @xmath18 and @xmath19 the lda value of the gap displays small oscillations while the ema results do not .",
    "lda includes electron - electron interaction effects and goes beyond nearest neighbor hopping while ema does not .",
    "however , when @xmath17 is larger than @xmath20 and @xmath6 or @xmath0 the ema results are approximately correct .",
    "we will employ ema to compute the approximate exchange self energy under these conditions .",
    "we choose @xmath4 and @xmath5 valleys as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the ribbon is along y - axis .",
    "the envelope wavefunctions @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] can be combined into @xmath25 , which satisfies the hamiltonian @xmath26 wavevector @xmath27 is measured from @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the upper and lower hamiltonians , respectively .",
    "the hard wall boundary conditions@xcite on each of the total a and b components of the wavefunction at the armchair edges @xmath28 and @xmath29 admix @xmath4 and @xmath5 valleys . note that envelope wavefunctions along the x - axis are @xmath30 and have the opposite wavevectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath0 we have @xmath63 , and the conduction subband with the _ lowest energy _ has the value @xmath64 corresponding to the value @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath1 we have @xmath66 , and the conduction subband with the _ lowest energy _ has the value @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath65 . in fig.[fig : exself ] @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for @xmath68 we can approximate @xmath69 where @xmath70 is meijer g - function@xcite . in fig.[fig : exself ] this approximate analytical result is compared with the exact numerical result of eq.([num ] ) .",
    "as expected , the agreement between the two are excellent for small values of @xmath51 .",
    "exchange self energies of doped graphene for ribbon widths @xmath6 and @xmath0 are shown in fig.[exchse ] . here",
    "the dimensionless fermi wavevector @xmath12 .",
    "we notice that the self energy displays oscillations as @xmath17 changes between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a similar effect was _ also _ observed in the lda result for the gap in the undoped case ( compare figs.[exchse ] and [ dft ] ) .",
    "spontaneous spin splitting will occur in the lowest conduction subband when @xmath71 , see fig.[fig : splitting ] .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath72 . at @xmath52",
    "the inequality is satisfied when @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath11 .",
    "the critical point between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states is shown schematically in fig.[phase](b ) .",
    "at @xmath76 no critical point exists since @xmath54 is too small , see fig.[fig : exself ] . in this case",
    "paramagnetic state is stable , as illustrated in fig.[phase](c ) .",
    "also we must require that the exchange self energy correction be smaller than the gap @xmath77 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath78 .",
    "we find at @xmath52 that this condition is satisfied when @xmath79 for @xmath74 and @xmath80 for @xmath11 .",
    "the dependence on the width can be understood by examining the wavefunction overlap that appears in the expression for the exchange self energy .",
    "it is given by @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath45 the quantity @xmath83 , which makes the dimensionless self energy @xmath54 smaller , see the integrand in eq.([num ] ) .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the presence of the phase factors @xmath84 only in certain components of the eigenstate wavefunctions ( see eq.([wave ] ) ) and that the value of @xmath31 for the lowest conduction subband is _ negative _ when @xmath1 ( see arguments below eq.([num ] ) ) . in other words",
    "it is a consequence of a subtle width - dependent mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states in the eigenstate wavefunctions .",
    "as the comparison with the lda result shows , when @xmath17 large and for @xmath6 and @xmath0 the result of ema is approximately correct .",
    "_ under _ these conditions we have employed ema to compute the approximate exchange self energy . we have shown that when _ only _ the lowest conduction subband of a graphene armchair ribbon is occupied magnetic properties of the one - dimensional electron gas may depend sensitively on the width of the ribbon .",
    "we find that , for ribbon widths @xmath0 , a critical point separates ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states while paramagnetic state is stable for @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence is in sharp contrast to one - dimensional electron gas of ordinary semiconductors , and can be understood by examining the wavefunction overlap that appears in the expression for the exchange self energy of an armchair ribbon .",
    "it reflects the fact that eigenstate wavefunctions of an armchair ribbon contain a non - trivial width - dependent mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "the large difference in the value of dielectric constant between graphene and ordinary semiconductors alone can not explain our width - dependent magnetic properties .",
    "the magnitude of the exchange spin splitting is of order @xmath85 , and , depending on the size of the fermi wavevector @xmath86 , it can vary in the range of @xmath87mev . as shown in fig.[fig : splitting ] our work suggests that the degree of spin polarization in a graphene armchair ribbon may be controlled by changing the gate voltage .",
    "an estimation , using the usual mean field value , gives that curie temperature @xmath88 is of the order of the exchange self energy @xmath89ev .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations may reduce this value .",
    "a spin - polarized cdw and a luttinger liquid are possible true groundstates",
    ". it may be worthwhile to investigate these issues using improved approximation schemes than ema employed in this paper , such as spin density functional method and exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "our results suggest that experimental investigations of magnetism in one dimensional electron gas of an armchair ribbon may produce numerous interesting results .",
