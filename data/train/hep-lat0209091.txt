    "in the unquenched qcd simulations using the hybrid monte carlo algorithm , the computational cost rapidly grows as the chiral limit of sea quark is approached . in practical simulations with wilson - type fermions",
    "the sea quark mass is limited to be heavier than @xmath0 . to obtain the physical results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , therefore",
    ", the chiral extrapolation is indispensable .    in the chiral extrapolation",
    "the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) may be used to decide the functional form , as it is an effective theory valid for low energy qcd .",
    "once the available lattice data are confirmed to be consistent with chpt , the extrapolation to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark masses using the chpt formula is justified .",
    "the practical question is , then , whether the lattice results could reproduce the sea quark mass dependence , especially the chiral logarithm , predicted by chpt .    in this talk",
    ", we present the sea quark mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson decay constant obtained in unquenched qcd , and compare them with the one - loop chpt prediction . the unquenched simulations",
    "are done using the standard gauge and nonperturbatively @xmath3-improved fermion action at @xmath4 = 5.2 with sea quark masses corresponding to the pion mass in the range 5501000  mev .",
    "further details of the simulation are discussed in a separate talk @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the uncertainty associated with the chiral extrapolation taking light - light and heavy - light decay constants as examples .",
    "in full qcd the chpt predicts a specific functional dependence of physical quantities on the quark mass , _",
    "i.e. _ the chiral logarithm , at the one - loop order . for @xmath5 flavors of degenerate quarks with a mass @xmath6 , the pseudoscalar meson decay constant @xmath7 is given by @xcite @xmath8,\\ ] ] with @xmath9 .",
    "while the low energy constants @xmath10 are unknown parameters , the chiral log term @xmath11 appears with a definite coefficient depending only on the number of flavors .",
    "[ fig : fpi_vs_mpi2 ]    figure  [ fig : fpi_vs_mpi2 ] shows the lattice results together with fitting curves . if we leave the coefficient of the chiral log term as a free parameter , the fit result is consistent with zero ( solid line ) , while the fit with the fixed coefficient @xmath12 gives a bad @xmath13 ( dashed line ) .",
    "a similar observation is obtained for the pcac relation @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "partially quenched chpt @xcite may be used to explicitly test the presence of the chiral logarithm . for non - degenerate pions composed of quarks with mass @xmath6 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 denotes a valence quark ) ,",
    "the low energy constants cancel out in the double ratios @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and only the chiral log terms remain . a parameter @xmath19 obtained as a coefficient of @xmath20 in ( [ eq : ratio_test_pcac ] ) and in ( [ eq : ratio_test_decay_constant ] )",
    "are plotted as a function of @xmath21 in figure  [ fig : ratio_test ] .",
    "we find that the results are much smaller than the prediction of the partially quenched chpt shown by a steep dashed line .",
    "[ fig : ratio_test ]",
    "since the lattice data do not support the presence of the chiral logarithm for the sea quark masses used in the simulation , the chiral extrapolation using the one - loop chpt formula is not fully justified .",
    "instead , we consider several possible functional forms to approach the chiral limit and discuss their associated uncertainty .",
    "our observation suggests that the mass region where the chiral logarithm becomes important is around or below 500  mev , and the chpt ceases to converge above that scale .",
    "then , a possible way to extrapolate the data including the effect of the chiral logarithm is to use a polynomial fit ( quadratic fit , for example ) above some energy scale @xmath22 , and then switch to the one - loop chpt formula below @xmath22 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : fpi_chiral_log_below_m ] for @xmath22 = 300 and 500  mev .",
    "the limit of @xmath22 = 0  mev corresponds to the usual polynomial fit . since the scale @xmath22 is unknown , the variation of several fit curves , about @xmath23  10% in the chiral limit ,",
    "should be taken as systematic uncertainty .",
    "another possible functional form suggested by the adelaide - mit group @xcite is the one - loop chpt with a hard momentum cutoff @xmath22 .",
    "it amounts to replace the chiral log term @xmath24 by @xmath25 . changing the unknown `` cutoff '' scale @xmath22 from 0 to 1  gev",
    ", we obtain the similar size of uncertainty in the chiral limit .",
    "[ fig : fpi_chiral_log_below_m ]    the su(3 ) breaking ratio in the decay constant @xmath26 may be obtained with a fit to partially quenched lattice data .",
    "our result from the above fit functions changes from 1.167(3 ) ( quadratic fit , corresponding to @xmath22 = 0  mev ) or 1.190(3 ) ( adelaide - mit fit , @xmath22 = 500  mev ) to 1.276(7 ) ( chiral log plus quadratic , corresponding to @xmath27  mev ) .",
    "although it is clear that our two - flavor qcd result is significantly higher than the quenched result 1.081(5)(17 ) @xcite and closer to the physical value 1.22 , the uncertainty is still sizable .    for the heavy - light decay constant",
    "the prediction of chpt is available in the heavy quark limit for quenched , partially quenched and full qcd @xcite .",
    "the chiral logarithm appears with a definite coefficient but including an additional coupling constant @xmath28 describing the @xmath29 interaction . the chiral extrapolation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 including the chiral logarithm is shown in figure  [ fig : fsqrtm_strange ] with two representative values of @xmath28 . as in the pion decay constant , the uncertainty in the chiral limit is enhanced by the chiral logarithm .    the ratio @xmath32 is needed in the extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath33 . since the bulk of systematic errors cancels in the ratio",
    ", one may expect better accuracy than the determination of @xmath34 solely from @xmath35 .",
    "our preliminary result varies from 1.24 ( quadratic fit ) to 1.38 ( chiral log , @xmath28 = 0.59 ) .",
    "it suggests that the ratio and its error can be significanly larger than the previous world average 1.16(4 ) .",
    "similar discussion , but using quenched data , has been made in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fsqrtm_strange ]",
    "the chiral logarithm expected from chpt is not observed in the unquenched lattice data with @xmath36 greater than about 500  mev , which suggests that chpt may only be applied in smaller mass regions .",
    "the estimate using model functions for the chiral extrapolation leads to the uncertainty as large as @xmath2310% for the decay constants .",
