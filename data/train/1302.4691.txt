    "the semi - analytical model by  @xcite ( sc ) for the eos of hydrogen and its extension to hydrogen - helium mixtures  @xcite were very successful and have been used in numerous calculations for the interiors of giant planets . however , with the development of _ ab initio _",
    "computer simulation techniques many uncontrolled approximations can now be avoided , simplifications inherent to analytical eos models and severely limiting their predictive capabilities in the regime of high density and low temperature where interactions between particles are strong . relying solely on analytical methods ,",
    "it is difficult to determine the ionization state of the different chemical species that are present in the dense fluid .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "simulations allow one to study a fully interacting system of particles and to determine its properties by deriving the electronic states explicitly for every configuration of nuclei .",
    "no parameters are adjusted to match experimental data , but _ ab initio _ simulations still rely on approximations to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , they are not specific to the particular material nor the pressure - temperature conditions under consideration .    in this paper , we rely on density functional molecular dynamics ( dft - md ) simulations that have been employed before to study hydrogen  @xcite , helium  @xcite and hydrogen - helium mixtures  @xcite . while the computation of the pressure and the internal energy is straightforward from dft - md simulations , the entropy is not directly accessible .",
    "however , an accurate knowledge of the entropy of hydrogen - helium mixtures at high pressure is of crucial importance for the determination of the temperature profile , the density , and the thermal energy budget in the interior of a giant planet . in 2008 , two groups constructed jupiter interior models from dft - md simulations  @xcite . while the derived pressures and internal energies can be considered to be more reliable than those predicted by the sc model , both papers predicted very different interior temperature profiles for jupiter  @xcite . using _",
    "ab initio _ thermodynamic integration techniques ( tdi ) , we recently showed  @xcite , that the work by  @xcite overestimated the temperature at jupiter s core - mantle boundary ( cmb ) by 3050 k ( 19% ) while we underestimated it by 2870 k ( 18% ) in @xcite .",
    "the revised temperature for the jupiter s cmb is 16@xmath2150@xmath2k and the corrections to the sc eos model are in fact only @xmath4k .    at conditions of jupiter s cmb , hydrogen is metallic and characterized by a high degree of electronic degeneracy .",
    "such a degenerate state is described rather well by the the sc model .",
    "however , when we applied the tdi technique to explicitly determine the entropy over a wide range of pressure - temperature conditions , we identified a number of discrepancies between the dft - md results and the sc model . near the molecular - to - metallic transition , our simulations predict a significant shift of the adiabat towards higher densities . at high temperature , where electronic excitations matter , our computed entropies are higher than those of the sc model .",
    "we also do not perfectly reproduce the sc entropies in the molecular regime at low density .    rather than providing a separate hydrogen and helium eos and relying on the linear mixing approximation  @xcite",
    ", we computed the eos over a wide range of density - temperature conditions for a representative mixing ratio of @xmath518 helium atoms in @xmath6 hydrogen atoms , corresponding to a helium mass fraction of @xmath7=0.245 , which is close to the solar value .",
    "this means that the nonideal mixing effects are fully incorporated . in  @xcite , we showed for example that the presence of helium makes the hydrogen molecules more stable and reduces the dissociation fraction at given pressure and temperature . even if other mixing ratios become of interest , as the result of helium rain  @xcite , one is still better off by starting from an eos for a typical hydrogen - helium mixture and then perturbing the mixing ratio by a comparatively small amount . increasing or decreasing the helium fraction requires knowledge of a helium or hydrogen eos , respectively . for the helium eos",
    ", we recommend our first - principles computation  @xcite because it provides simulation data points for the pressure , @xmath8 , internal energy , @xmath9 , helmholtz free energy , @xmath10 , and entropy , @xmath11 , over a wide parameter range and a thermodynamically consistent free energy fit for interpolation . for available hydrogen eos work",
    ", we refer to the recent review by  @xcite but there has also been a considerable theoretical effort compute the hydrogen eos with semi - analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "if the perturbation in the helium fraction is sufficiently small , one may use the sc eos for simplicity .",
    "we base our _ ab initio _ entropy calculations on our recent article  @xcite where we showed how the tdi technique can be extended to study molecular hydrogen and how it can be applied efficiently to determine the entropy at high temperature where electronic excitations matter .",
    "the tdi technique allows one to determine the difference in the helmholtz free energy between two interacting many - body systems at fixed density and temperature  @xcite .",
    "we apply this method to determine the free energy difference between the dft simulations and a system of classical forces that we construct : @xmath12 the angle brackets represent an average over trajectories governed by forces that are derived from a hybrid potential energy function , @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the potential energy of the classical system and @xmath15 is the kohn - sham energy  @xcite .",
    "the presence of electronic excitations leads to an intrinsic contribution to the entropy and affects the forces on the nuclei  @xcite that need to be derived from the mermin free energy  @xcite , @xmath16 .",
    "we combined both contributions into the following expression for the _ ab initio _",
    "entropy  @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18 includes contributions from partially occupied excited states . the @xmath19 integration was performed using five independent md simulations with @xmath19 equally spaced between 0 and 1 . to make this integration process efficient",
    ", we construct the pair potentials of the classical system to match the dft forces as closely as possible  @xcite .",
    "the computation of classical free energy is performed with monte carlo methods by thermodynamic integration to an system of noninteracting particles .",
    "all simulations were performed with the vasp code  @xcite with pseudopotentials of the projector - augmented wave type  @xcite and a plane wave basis set cutoff of at least 1000  ev .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional  @xcite was used throughout , but it has been shown recently that simulations based on the local density approximation yielded very similar results for jupiter s deep interior  @xcite . in the same article , we also performed a combined finite - size and @xmath20 point analysis that demonstrated that simulations with 256 electrons and the zone - average point @xmath21 are sufficiently accurate .",
    "all results that we report in this article were thus obtained with 220 hydrogen and 18 helium atoms in periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we used a md time step 0.2 fs , except for temperature of 50@xmath2000@xmath2k and above where we used a time step of 0.1 fs to accurately capture the more rapid collisions between particles at elevated temperatures .",
    "all standard dft - md simulations that we performed to determine @xmath8 and @xmath9 were 2.0 ps long , except at the highest temperatures , where 1.0 ps were found to be sufficient because the auto - correlation times are short and the error bars are small .",
    "all simulations were initialized with positions and velocity vectors from converged md simulations at nearby densities and temperatures .",
    "this allowed us to run the tdi simulations for only 0.5 ps at each @xmath19 point .",
    "we also adjusted the number of orbitals in the calculations to accommodate the partial occupation of excited electronic states according to mermin functional  @xcite .",
    "the number of orbitals was increased until the error in the integral of the fermi function was reduced to less than 10@xmath22 .",
    "this required many orbitals at high temperature and low density .",
    "up to 816 were used , a significant increase in the computational cost over the 128 needed for ground state calculations .",
    "this is the primary reason why we omitted simulations that would lead to entropy values above approximately 12.5 @xmath23/el .",
    "the regime of higher temperatures can be studied much more efficiently with path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations because the computational cost of this alternative first - principles simulation technique scales like @xmath24 .",
    "pimc simulations have been applied to hydrogen  @xcite , helium  @xcite , and hydrogen - helium mixtures  @xcite at high pressure and temperature and most recently also to study the eos of carbon and water  @xcite .",
    "we report the computed equation of state in the form of a table , a series of figures , and in analytical form as two - dimensional fit of the free energy . in table",
    "[ eos ] , we provide the thermodynamic functions that directly follow from analysis of the dft - md trajectories . the pressure and internal energy were computed for 391 different density - temperature points ( see fig .  [ eostrs ] ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath25 error bars correspond to statistical uncertainty that arises from the finite length of the md simulations . for 131 points in table  [ eos ] ,",
    "the thermodynamic integration was performed with five @xmath19 points and the free energy and entropy are reported in addition . only counting the production runs that led to results in table 1 , the total cpu time consumed for this project amounted to 850@xmath2000 core - hours on intel nehalem processors .",
    "this is equivalent to using 100 cores for an entire year , which is a considerable amount of computer time by today s standards but will certainly become available to everyone in the near future as computers with more and more cores are assembled .    in figures",
    "[ eoset ] , [ eoserho ] , [ eospt ] , [ eosprho ] , [ eosft ] , [ eosfrho ] , [ eosst ] , and [ eossrho ] , we plot the internal energy , pressure , helmholtz free energy , and entropy respectively as a function of temperature and density . every circle corresponds to a particular dft - md simulation listed in table  [ eos ] , without any interpolation being performed .",
    "the dashed lines are the results of the most common version of the analytical sc eos model where the different thermodynamic functions have been smoothly interpolated across the molecular - to - metallic transition in hydrogen .    to accommodate the wide parameter range of our simulations",
    ", we plot the different thermodynamic functions on logarithmic scale . since these functions depend strongly on density and temperature , we added a second panel where we removed most of this dependence by introducing a scale factor equal to @xmath26 or @xmath27 raised to some power . here",
    "@xmath26 is the wigner - seitz radius that specifies the density of system according to @xmath28 , while @xmath29 is the number of electrons , @xmath30 , per unit volume @xmath31 .",
    "the mass density is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the masses of the hydrogen and helium atoms .",
    "the rescaling of the ordinate makes it easier to identify the deviations from the sc model while our simulation results can still be reproduced easily .",
    "the ordinates are plotted in atomic units .",
    "lengths including @xmath26 are given in bohr radii ( @xmath35=5.29177209@xmath36 m ) , energies in hartrees ( 4.35974380@xmath37j ) per electron ( el . ) , and entropies are specified in units of @xmath23 per electron , where @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "figure  [ eoset ] shows a comparison between the internal energies from dft - md simulations with the predictions of the sc eos model . for a low density of @xmath38 ,",
    "excellent agreement is found for a temperature range from 1000 to 20@xmath2000@xmath2k .",
    "hydrogen gradually changes from a molecular state to an atomic state in this temperature interval and , from the good agreement , one may conclude that the thermally activated dissociation of molecules is well described in the sc model .",
    "however , 20@xmath2000@xmath2k , the sc model predicts an strong and artificial increase in the internal energy that is the result of an inaccurate description of electronic excitations .",
    "this deviation was first identified by  @xcite when predictions from the sc model were compared with pimc simulations .",
    "figure  [ eoserho ] shows that this deviation is present at 20@xmath2000@xmath2k for whole density range under consideration and extends to much higher temperatures also .",
    "figure  [ eoset ] shows that the favorable agreement between dft - md results and sc predictions below 20@xmath2000@xmath2k continues to hold up to a density of @xmath39 .",
    "when the internal energy is compared for a higher density of @xmath40 or 1.2 where hydrogen is metallic , one finds that dft - md results and sc predictions are offset by a nearly constant amount .",
    "the internal energy curves of @xmath39 and 2.4 appear to cross over in fig .",
    "[ eoset ] at a temperature of 27@xmath2000@xmath2k , which is consistently predicted by dft - md results and the sc model .",
    "figure  [ eoserho ] shows that this is simply a consequence of internal energy exhibiting a minimum when plotted at constant temperature as function of density . at high density ,",
    "the internal energy sharply rises because of pauli exclusion effects between the electrons . in the low density limit ,",
    "the internal energy rises also because the ionization fraction increases as a result of the increased gain in entropy that is associated with electrons becoming free particles .    in fig .",
    "[ eospt ] , we compare the pressure predicted from dft - md simulation with the sc model . at a high density of @xmath40 where the hydrogen - helium mixture is metallic",
    ", we find fairly good agreement over the entire temperature range .",
    "this implies that the deviation that we identified for the internal energy in this regime , varies slowly with density and does not significantly affect the pressure in the sc model .    at a low density of @xmath41 and 2.4 ,",
    "we found good agreement up to a temperature of 5000@xmath2k .",
    "at this temperature , we see a small decrease in slope in the dft - md data that is missing in the predictions of the sc model .",
    "we attribute this slope change to the dissociation of molecules in the dft - md simulations . at 20@xmath2000@xmath2k ,",
    "the sc model predicts a significant decrease in slope which is not present in the dft - md data .",
    "this slope change in the sc predictions can again be attributed to an inaccurate description of ionization , which leads to deviations over the whole density range under consideration ( fig .",
    "[ eosprho ] ) . at an intermediate density of @xmath39 close to the molecular - to - metallic transition",
    ", we find that the sc model overestimates the pressure up to about 20@xmath2000@xmath2k and underestimates for higher temperatures .",
    "the deviations around 100 gpa , 5000@xmath2k , and @xmath39 ( 0.75 g@xmath2@xmath3 ) are of particular significance .",
    "the dft - md simulations predict pressures that are much lower than those of the sc model .",
    "this leads a significant departure in the resulting adiabats .",
    "its implication for the interiors of giant planets will later be further analyzed .    in figures",
    "[ eosft ] and [ eosfrho ] , the helmholtz free energy from dft - md simulations and the sc model are compared .",
    "in general the agreement appears to be much better than for other thermodynamic functions that are derivatives of it .",
    "still , one finds that the sc model overestimates the free energy in the metallic regime , mirroring the deviations that we have discussed for the internal energy .    in figures",
    "[ eosst ] , the entropies at different densities are compared as a function of temperature . at a very high density of @xmath40 , very good agreement between dft - md results and the sc model is found up to 50@xmath2000@xmath2k . for lower densities ,",
    "the sc model predicts a sharp entropy increase at 20@xmath2000@xmath2k , which is again a result of the treatment of ionization effects .",
    "this trend is not confirmed by the dft - md simulations .",
    "one also finds significant deviations at lower temperatures , in particular around @xmath26=1.6 . even at a relatively low density of @xmath41 ,",
    "the agreement is not perfect . from 4000 to 20@xmath2000@xmath2k",
    ", the sc model underestimates the entropy and it overestimates the entropy for lower temperatures .",
    "figure  [ eossrho ] shows that such deviations persist over a wider density range . in principle , one expects a non- or weakly interacting gas of hydrogen molecules and helium atoms to be perfectly described by the sc model .",
    "however , the density that we can efficiently study with dft - md simulations does not yet appear to be low enough for the deviations to decay to zero .",
    "we fitted our _ ab initio _ results for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 in table  [ eos ] with a two - dimensional spline function that represents the helmholtz free energy in terms of temperature , @xmath27 , and electron density , @xmath42 . by construction , this fit is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "we employ the same functional form that we used to represent the free energy of hot , dense helium in  @xcite , except the splines here are functions of @xmath29 rather than @xmath43 .",
    "table  [ eos_fit ] provides the free energy as well as the required derivatives on a number of @xmath44 knot points .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .    to evaluate the fit for @xmath45",
    ", we first construct a separate one - dimensional cubic spline function , @xmath46 , for every density on a grid ranging from @xmath26=3.581 to 0.536 ( 0.0670@xmath120.0@xmath2g@xmath2@xmath3 ) . at every density ,",
    "the free energy is given on a number of temperature knots and its first derivative , @xmath47 , is specified for the highest and lowest temperatures .",
    "we construct a similar one - dimensional spline function that represents @xmath48 at the smallest and largest density .",
    "we then evaluate all these splines functions at @xmath49 and construct a one - dimensional spline function @xmath50 from the free energy values and its first derivatives at the boundaries .",
    "this provides us not only with a straightforward way to obtain the free energy at every @xmath44 point but we can also derive the pressure and entropy by taking analytical derivatives , @xmath51 the internal energy and gibbs free energy then follow from @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ".    when we constructed this fit , we made sure every eos point in table  [ eos ] is well reproduced .",
    "we extended the domain of the fit a bit beyond the range of the dft - md data .",
    "this leads to a smoother representation of the data in the interior of the domain and also allows us to gradually approach the sc eos in the limit of low density .",
    "as figure  [ ad ] shows , we were able to smoothly match onto the sc adiabats for entropy values from 6 to 10 and again for 13 and 14 @xmath23/el .",
    "a disagreement remains for s=11 and 12 @xmath23/el .",
    "but the sc eos is not thermodynamically consistent in the regime of 10@xmath2000@xmath2 to 20@xmath2000@xmath2k and no attempt was made to reproduce those adiabats .",
    "so far , only the one exoplanet hat - p-32b  @xcite appears to have an internal entropy in excess of 11 @xmath23/el . ; see figure  [ rvsm ] .",
    "we also find a significant disagreement in the high density limit between our dft - md adiabats and the predictions of the sc model . starting with entropy values of @xmath54/el .",
    ", the dft - md results predict the adiabats reach states of higher temperatures and higher pressure for a given density .    the most significant result of fig .",
    "[ ad ] is the deviations along the @xmath11=7 @xmath23/el .",
    "the dft - md simulations predict a decrease in slope of the adiabat exactly where the hydrogen molecules dissociate  @xcite .",
    "since the sc model interpolates between separate atomic / metallic and molecular thermodynamic descriptions , it has no predictive power in the regime of pressure dissociation where all the different species interact strongly .",
    "in fig .  [ jupiter ] , we compare different predictions for the adiabat in jupiter s interior . similar to  @xcite , the calculations of the entropy by  @xcite relied solely on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 from dft - md simulations .",
    "since no tdi was employed , the entropy was determined indirectly from thermodynamic relationships and an integration over a large path through density - temperature space .",
    "here one faces two challenges . since the integration can only yield the entropy difference between two @xmath55-@xmath27 points , one needs to find a starting point for the integration where dft - md simulations work and the entropy is known reliably through other means .",
    "secondly , one needs to determine @xmath8 and @xmath9 on a very fine grid in @xmath55-@xmath27 space , so that integration errors do not accumulate .",
    "since both challenges are difficult to meet , we instead adopted the more reliable tdi technique that we extended to molecular systems in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ jupiter ] shows that there exist some discrepancies between our tdi calculations and the  @xcite results in the low density as well as the high density limit . in the molecular regime at 10 gpa ,",
    "nettelmann et al.s temperatures for jupiter s adiabat are 8% higher than our tdi calculations predict . in the metallic regime at 4000",
    "gpa , their results are 19% higher than our tdi predictions .",
    "this implies that there exist discrepancies in the low and high density limits before any _ ab initio _ @xmath8 and @xmath9 data points are entered into the calculation of the adiabats by  @xcite .",
    "adiabats based on the  @xcite work now show a pronounced flattening in the regime of molecular dissociation from 15 - 40 gpa that was not present in the  @xcite calculations .",
    "the pressure range similar to our _ ab initio _ results but the magnitude is higher than we predict based on tdi . from 40 to 200 gpa ,",
    "the  @xcite calculations predict a steep rise in temperature for the adiabats .",
    "this is not consistent with our tdi calculations and implies that in models by  @xcite most of jupiter s mass is at 19% higher temperature than we predict based on our tdi calculations . in the low and high density limits , our adiabats are instead in relatively good agreement with the sc model .",
    "the vexing problem of radius anomalies of transiting giant planets  @xcite has continued with the addition of more objects  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ rvsm ] shows measurements posted in the online exoplanet encyclopaedia  @xcite as of late 2012 and different theoretical curves that we will discuss below .",
    "briefly , the problem arises from a significant population of exoplanets that have radii too large to be explained by thermal distention from retained primordial heat , and there is a further population with radii well below those expected for primarily h - he composition even at zero temperature .",
    "any point that falls below the @xmath56/el .",
    "curve can be explained by invoking the presence of a rocky core and/or admixture of heavy elements , which reduces the radius for given mass  @xcite .",
    "but it is not so simple to classify the population of anomalously distended giant exoplanets , for the degree of distention depends on such factors as the planet s age and degree of irradiation from the host star  @xcite , and possible additional heating mechanisms such as ohmic dissipation  @xcite .    in order to most clearly exhibit",
    "the differences in predicted radius between the dft - md simulations and analytical sc model , we model a planet of mass @xmath57 as a h - he object of constant entropy @xmath11 and fixed helium fraction of @xmath58 with neither a rocky core nor heavy element component in the gas envelope .",
    "since we do not have dft - md simulation data at very low densities , we switch back to the sc model below 0.0670@xmath2g@xmath2@xmath3 , the lowest density of the free energy fit to our dft - md data .    as is well known  @xcite , formally such an object has a precisely defined radius where the temperature @xmath27 , mass density @xmath55 , and pressure @xmath8 simultaneously go to zero . in a real object",
    ", the ideal - gas outer layers can not persist in such an isentropic state and instead the temperature reaches a finite limit set by the effective temperature for the radiation balance in the outer layers .",
    "the radius as measured by transit observations also depends on sources of slant opacity in these outer layers .",
    "as explored by  @xcite , the value of such a radius can vary by several @xmath59 , depending on the atmospheric model . adjusting the parameters controlling",
    "the atmosphere can move a model closer to agreement with objects of inflated radii , but sometimes a mismatch remains .",
    "a major result of the present paper is that differences in the eos alone can also lead to radius changes of several @xmath59 . because we consider only strict - adiabatic models , the deviations that we point out are entirely due to differences in the eos at high pressure . in figure",
    "[ drvsm ] , we exhibit these differences for various entropies . for entropy values up to 9 @xmath23/el . , the dft - md calculations consistently predict smaller planet radii than the sc model , which is a direct consequence of the density enhancement on the adiabats around 100 gpa illustrated in figs .

    "cross over in the density range from 0.15 to 0.7@xmath2g@xmath2@xmath3 .",
