    "it is in agreement with bell s theorem due to explicit non - local effects.@xcite for a relativistic particle , the postulates are : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-field satisfies the dirac equation , ( 2 ) the particle s trajectory is determined by a first order equation @xmath1 for conserved current @xmath2 depending on @xmath0,@xcite and ( 3 ) the statistical ensemble of positions obeys the born rule : @xmath3 for probability density @xmath4 at some initial time slice .",

    "we review the klein paradox and discuss its resolution through this interpretation in section [ section : paradoxa ] . numerical simulations of a gaussian packet incident on potential steps of various heights are presented in section [ section : paradoxb ] .",
    "the potential barrier is analyzed in a similar context in section [ section : barrier ] , and numerical simulations are presented in section [ section : barrier_sim ] .",

    "@xmath74 , we change @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) in such regions .",
    "applying this change to the wavefunction yields @xmath77 satisfying the time - reversed dirac equation@xcite : @xmath78 which corresponds to the complex conjugate in one dimension ; this does nt affect @xmath79 , @xmath80 , or the correct boundary condition @xmath81 since the phase cancels out . applying the change @xmath82 to the guiding equation ( [ eq : dirac_guiding ] ) in region ii yields : @xmath83 this changes the sign of @xmath84 , and therefore @xmath85 .",

    "they constructively interfere forming the reflected packet @xmath56 which moves forward in time from the step boundary to @xmath88 .    applying the pilot wave interpretation",
    ", there is a probability that the particle is in either packet @xmath86 or packet @xmath57 ( even though the two packets are nt on the same time slice ) with a definite , continuous trajectory _ over all _ of spacetime . the particle s initial spacetime position used to uniquely solve the guiding equation",
    "is defined at @xmath91 ; since @xmath92 in region i , @xmath93 as @xmath94 implying an ensemble of initial positions in packet @xmath86 . in region",
    "ii , @xmath95 such that @xmath96 as @xmath94 ; this implies the ensemble also includes a distribution of initial positions in packet @xmath57 which will travel backwards in time by the guidance condition .",
    "if the particle starts in packet @xmath86 , it is reflected at the step boundary ; if the particle starts in packet @xmath57 , it goes backwards in time to the step boundary , and then moves forward in time with packet @xmath56 towards @xmath88 . in the lab frame",
    ", this would appear to describe the creation of a particle / anti - particle pair at the step boundary .",
    "as there are two particles in the lab frame , it would be more accurate to describe the ensemble as a single particle _ process _ since there is only a single , continuous trajectory over all of spacetime . if the particle s initial spacetime point corresponds to reflection , the overall charge is @xmath97 ( for electrons ) ; if the initial spacetime point corresponds to a trajectory backwards in time , the overall charge is @xmath98 since in the lab we observe pair creation at the step boundary .",
    "it follows that charge is conserved on each time slice .",
    "returning to the interpretation of probability , we see at @xmath91 , there are two spacetime packets containing the ensemble with coefficients @xmath86 & @xmath57 . solving for @xmath86 & @xmath57 : @xmath99 as @xmath100 , all the particles move to the packet with coefficient @xmath56 . since @xmath101 , the relation : @xmath102 implies the conservation of _ spacetime _ probability with respect to @xmath16 ; @xmath103 is probability of the particle starting in packet @xmath86 at @xmath91 , and @xmath104 is the probability of the particle starting in packet @xmath57 at @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that the average number of particle / anti - particle pairs produced at the step boundary is given by@xcite : @xmath105 we can now reinterpret klein s result : as @xmath60 , @xmath106 approaches a finite non - zero value .",
    "this implies that for a potential @xmath107 , there will be pair production at the step boundary even if @xmath60 .",
    "the new feature of the interpretation is the probability of an _ initial _ particle position at a _ future _ time slice .",
    "as we shall see in section [ section : barrier ] , this is nt encountered in the potential barrier case .",
    "the feature is due to the infinite extent of the potential @xmath108 to @xmath90 yielding an asymptotic negative energy solution .",
    "we present numerical simulations for an incident gaussian packet starting with the free particle ( case 0 ) .",
    "the three cases with @xmath109 are : @xmath110 ( case 1 ) , @xmath111 ( case 2 ) , and the klein paradox @xmath112 ( case 3 ) . setting @xmath113 ,",
    "the packet is constructed by integrating plane wave solutions over energy . following the notation of nitta , kudo , and",
    "minowa,@xcite we start by defining : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the heaviside step function . the forward evolving solution @xmath116 ( and corresponding boundary condition ) is replaced by the time - reversed wavefunction @xmath77 for case 3 .",
    "the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath117 is : @xmath118 where @xmath119 for case 1 , @xmath120 for case 2 , and @xmath121 for case 3 . the gaussian function @xmath122 is defined as : @xmath123 for mean momentum @xmath124 , mean position @xmath125 , and position spread @xmath126 .",
    "the mean momentum is taken to be @xmath127 ( except for case 0 ) such that the mean incident velocity is @xmath128 , and the mean energy is @xmath129 .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "the probability density is plotted ( figure [ fig : free1 ] ) , and the trajectories for a random gaussian distribution are computed ( figure [ fig : free2 ] ) . since @xmath135 by our choice of units , the initial wavefunction is confined to a width smaller than the compton wavelength causing two packets to move out near the speed of light .",
    "the _ zitterbewegung _ motion visible in the trajectories is due to the interference between positive and negative energy states . in general the trajectories may converge , but do not cross ; this is expected by uniqueness from the first order guiding equation in one spatial dimension .    next we consider case 1 : @xmath136 ( figure [ fig : step1 ] & [ fig : step2 ] ) taking @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "similar to non - relativistic tunneling,@xcite particles starting closer to the step continue through it , and particles starting further from the step may never reach it ( and are reflected even though @xmath139 ) . this must be the case , again by uniqueness .",
    "there is a clear bifurcation point between reflected & transmitted trajectories based on initial position .",
    "we now consider case 2 : @xmath140 ( figure [ fig : decay1 ] & [ fig : decay2 ] ) with parameters @xmath141 and @xmath138 .",
    "the potential is chosen such that the negative energy continuum is not opened up .",
    "the solution corresponds to an exponential decay for @xmath47 , and therefore total reflection which can be seen in the trajectories .",
    "lastly we consider case 3 : the klein paradox with @xmath142 ( figure [ fig : klein1 ] & [ fig : klein2 ] ) for parameters @xmath143 and @xmath138 .",
    "it can be seen from the probability distribution ( figure [ fig : klein1 ] ) that the reflected packet is larger than the incident packet .",
    "the probability distributions can be integrated at initial time @xmath144 , and final time @xmath145 : @xmath146 @xmath147 and the probability conservation @xmath148 with respect to affine parameter @xmath16 can be verified numerically .",
    "the initial conditions for the particle distribution are on the @xmath144 and @xmath145 time slices , and correspond to a random gaussian centered on the packets .",
    "it can be seen from the trajectories ( figure [ fig : klein2 ] ) that all incident particles are reflected , and all particles starting at @xmath145 form a `` _ _ v _ _ '' shape corresponding to pair creation at the boundary . by the choice of mean energy and barrier height",
    ", the anti - particles in region ii move at a greater velocity than the particles in region i.      a similar numerical analysis is performed on the potential barrier ( cases 1 - 3 ) taking @xmath138 .",
    "we choose @xmath174 such that the mean incident velocity is @xmath175 , and the mean energy is @xmath176 .",
    "the probability distributions are integrated , and the conservation equation @xmath177 is verified numerically .",
    "we start with case 1 : @xmath139 ( figure [ fig : barrier_step1 ] & [ fig : barrier_step2 ] ) for @xmath178 and barrier width @xmath179 .",
    "two reflected packets are visible from scattering off both sides of the barrier .",
    "the initial conditions on the @xmath144 time slice correspond to a random gaussian distribution centered around the packet .",
    "the particles slow down inside of the barrier , and reflection still occurs with small probability even though @xmath139 .",
    "next we consider case 2 : @xmath180 ( figure [ fig : barrier_decay1 ] & [ fig : barrier_decay2 ] ) with @xmath141 and barrier width @xmath181 .",
    "the small width is chose such that a non - negligible packet tunnels through the barrier .",
    "this most closely resembles non - relativistic tunneling through a potential barrier@xcite since the solution is exponentially decaying inside region ii .",
    "lastly we perform a simulation for case 3 : @xmath182 ( figure [ fig : barrier_klein1 ] & [ fig : barrier_klein2 ] ) taking @xmath143 and barrier width @xmath183 .",
    "the fabry - perot pattern described in section [ section : barrier ] is visible as ripples in the probability density .",
    "while the packet inside the barrier appears to contradict the initial wavefunction on the @xmath144 time slice , it should be kept in mind that this is due to the finite size of the box used for the simulation .",
    "the packet that travels backwards in time in region ii diminishes in size as @xmath93 such that the initial wavefunction as @xmath184 is a gaussian packet in region i. for the purposes of numerical verification of probability conservation , we must add : @xmath185 corresponding to conservation with respect to affine parameter @xmath16 . by increasing the box size and moving the initial packet further from the barrier , @xmath186 and equality is approached .",
    "the particles which tunnel through the barrier appear to emerge in region iii _ before _",
    "the particle in region i reached the potential boundary .",
    "according to the interpretation , this is due to the particle going backwards in time inside region ii . in the lab frame",
    ", this corresponds to a particle pair being produced at the right side of the barrier ; the particle goes off to @xmath90 , and the anti - particle annihilates the incident particle on the left side of the boundary at a later time .",
    "as previously stated , particle trajectories can not cross by uniqueness .",
    "it follows that a particle going backwards in time inside region ii can not tunnel back into region i and continue to @xmath88 .",
    "instead it can be seen that incident particles are reflected well before reaching the barrier , and form distinct bands . by tracing the reflected trajectories of figure [ fig : barrier_klein2 ] backwards towards the barrier",
    ", one sees that they agree with the spacetime points where particles would have tunneled back into region i after multiple internal reflections in region ii ( analogous to the interferometer ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wavefunction _ can _ cross itself resulting in the fabry - perot pattern .",
    "since the particles are _ guided _ by the wave , this pattern is therefore visible in the trajectories.@xcite similar behavior occurs for the transmitted particles when tunneling out into region iii .",
    "the interpretation therefore produces the asymptotic behavior of the fabry - perot interferometer analogy .",
    "now we apply the interpretation to the potential barrier.@xcite the potential is given by : @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 . defining @xmath45 ,",
    "the solution in region i is : @xmath46 defining @xmath51 , in region ii : @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 corresponds to the time - reversed solution in region ii .",
    "continuity at the boundary @xmath81 yields : @xmath54 @xmath155 the solution in region iii is given by : @xmath156 with boundary condition @xmath157 such that : @xmath158 we can then compute @xmath56 & @xmath57 as : @xmath159 and the reflection & transmission probabilities : @xmath160   ( 1-\\kappa^2)^2   } { \\left ( 1+\\kappa \\right)^4+\\left ( 1-\\kappa \\right)^4 - 2 \\ \\text{cos}[2",
    "k l ] ( 1-\\kappa^2)^2    } \\\\",
    "\\frac{|t|^2}{|a|^2 } = \\frac{16 \\kappa^2}{(1+\\kappa)^4+(1-\\kappa)^4- 2 \\ \\text{cos}[2 k l ] ( 1-\\kappa^2)^2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] from which it follows @xmath161 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac_guiding ] ) , the velocity in region i is : @xmath162 similarly in region iii we have : @xmath163 where the solutions correspond to positive energy states in regions i & iii . in region",
    "ii : @xmath164 after changing @xmath165 for the negative energy state .",
    "the top signs corresponds to @xmath166 , and bottom to @xmath167 . in regions",
    "i & iii , @xmath168 as @xmath94 such that the distribution of initial position is at @xmath87 & @xmath88 . in region",
    "ii , @xmath169 as @xmath94 ; since there is no wave at @xmath89 in region ii,@xcite there is nt a distribution of initial positions at @xmath89 as we saw in the klein step .",
    "this implies the entire distribution is in region i at @xmath87 & @xmath88 .",
    "we do nt encounter the feature of the klein paradox ( with an `` initial '' distribution of particles at @xmath89 ) regarding probability since @xmath161 , but there is still finite transmission as @xmath60 .",
    "this again suggests that there will be pair creation at the right side of the barrier even if @xmath60 .",
    "as pointed out by thomson and mckellar,@xcite there is an analogy between the fabry - perot interferometer , and the incident wavefunction that enters region ii and moves backwards in time .",
    "the packet in region ii will diminish as smaller packets tunnel out of the barrier and move forward in time ( the limit of multiple internal reflections is studied in the appendix ) .",
    "this results in a fabry - perot pattern in regions i & iii at @xmath170 . as we will see in section [ section : barrier_sim ] , this pattern is visible in the particle trajectories .",
    "a comment should be made on the choice of words used to describe this process .",
    "the wave packet `` traveling backwards in time '' is used as an interpretational description similar to a particle going `` forwards / backwards '' in time . like the particle worldline",
    ", the wavefunction exists over all of spacetime , and therefore should nt be thought of as _ dynamically _ evolving in spacetime .",
    "it is equivalent to think of the wavefunction evolving forward in time from the initial conditions set at @xmath171 , but via the time reversed solution in region ii .",
    "the _ initial _ condition in region ii at @xmath172 can therefore be viewed as a _ final _ condition being evolved backwards to @xmath173 .",
    "we have shown that a consistent explanation can be given for a single relativistic particle process by combining the pilot wave and feynman - stueckelberg interpretations .",
    "the interpretation can be applied to scattering off a potential barrier as well as the klein paradox . in this context , the original statement of the paradox then becomes a statement about pair production at the boundaries of high potentials .",
    "it would seem that the klein step still has an interesting feature , even with this interpretation : the particle s initial condition is distributed with non - zero probability at a future time slice .",
    "this is due to the infinite extent of the potential @xmath31 yielding a negative energy solution at @xmath90 - something that does not occur in the potential barrier . for both cases the wave traveling backwards in time interferes with itself ; this causes constructive interference for the reflected packet in the klein step , and a fabry - perot pattern for the klein barrier .",
    "future work can include the application of this interpretation to bosons where the dirac sea picture breaks down , as well as a cohesive interpretation of a many particle process .",
    "ascribing a continuous trajectory to the particle in this deterministic interpretation provides an intuitive perspective on particle creation / annihilation , and a resolution to the historic paradox .",
    "we show for the case of the klein barrier that a packet going backwards in time inside region ii diminishes in size as @xmath168 .",
    "this is done by showing the probability of an arbitrarily large number of internal reflections approaches zero .",
    "the probability of an incident packet being reflected without entering region ii is @xmath187 .",
    "the probability of a transmitted packet not undergoing any internal reflection is @xmath188 . for each higher order @xmath189 of asymptotic reflection @xmath190 or transmission @xmath191 probability ( corresponding to @xmath192 internal reflections inside region ii ) , we multiply by @xmath193 : @xmath194 @xmath195 where the number of internal reflections is @xmath196 for asymptotically reflected packets , and @xmath197 for asymptotically transmitted packets",
    ". we can solve for @xmath193 as : @xmath198   \\right)^2\\ ] ] for the probability of an arbitrary number of internal reflections to approach zero , we require : @xmath199 since @xmath200 .",
    "using @xmath150 , @xmath182 , and being careful with signs : @xmath201 we conclude the packet traveling backwards in time inside region ii decays as @xmath168 ."
