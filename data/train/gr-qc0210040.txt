    "the border case of @xmath6 of the extraordinary quintessence covers the cosmological constant term .",
    "as was recognized @xcite , the acceleration makes a challenge for the consistent theory of quantum gravity because of the outer horizon , which does not allow one to introduce the observable s - matrix in terms of asymptotic past and future states .",

    "we investigate the einstein equations for the static spherically - symmetric quintessence surrounding a black hole and solve them exactly for a specific choice of a free parameter , characterizing the energy - momentum tensor of the quintessence , @xmath7 .",
    "so , under the spherical symmetry of a static state one can write down a general expression for the time and spatial components @xmath8 with the metric @xmath9 and after averaging over the angles of isotropic state we get @xmath10 for the quintessence we have @xmath11 therefore , fixing the state parameter @xmath4 gives the expression for the function @xmath12 being the combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in terms of density @xmath15 , while @xmath4 itself does not provide us with the complete information on the form of energy - momentum tensor in the static spherically - symmetric case .",
    "the problem with the free quintessence under the condition of @xmath16 was considered in @xcite and in @xcite by p.f.gonzalez-diaz .",
    "the result was the metric , which has no horizon , no ` hair ' and no black hole , i.e. the metric does not allow one to ` embrace a black hole term ' .    in the present paper we consider nonzero @xmath13 proportional to @xmath14",

    "we find that in the static coordinates the exact solutions of spherically - symmetric einstein equations for the quintessence produce the outer horizons at @xmath5 in the cases of free state as well as for the black hole surrounded by the quintessence .",
    "in section [ 1 ] we construct a general solution of spherically - symmetric static einstein equations for the quintessence satisfying the condition of the additivity and linearity , which allows us to cover the problems with the black hole charged or not in the flat or de sitter space .",
    "section [ 2 ] is devoted to the consideration of examples and limits known for the relativistic matter and the cosmological constant .",
    "the gibbons  hawking temperatures @xcite of the free quintessence as well as for the black hole surrounded by the quintessence with @xmath20 are described in section [ 3 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in conclusion .",
    "following the notations in @xcite , we parameterize the interval of spherically - symmetric static gravitational field by @xmath21 with the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "the isotropic averaging over the angeles results in @xmath30 since we put @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we derive the relations @xmath32 the quintessential state has @xmath33 let us define a principle of additivity and linearity by the equality , putting the relation between the metric components , @xmath34 without any lose of generality due to the static coordinate system fixed by the above gauge of @xmath35 , since the constant can be nullified by an appropriate rescaling of time .    then , substituting for @xmath36 we get linear differential equations in @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 & & { t_\\theta}^\\theta   =   { t_\\phi}^\\phi = - \\frac{1}{4\\,r}\\,(2 f^\\prime + r\\,f^{\\prime\\prime } ) .",

    "the function of @xmath46 represents the ordinary schwarzschild solution for the point - like black hole , and it coincides with the particular choice of dust matter with @xmath19 in @xmath47 , which gives @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "if we put the density of energy to be positive , @xmath50 , then from the formula @xmath51 we deduce that the sign of the normalization constant should coincide with the sign of the matter state parameter , i.e. @xmath52 implying that @xmath44 is negative for the quintessence .",

    "the corresponding condition of the additivity and linearity results in the linear equations for the various matter terms consistent with the simple summation of their contributions in the total energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the free spherically - symmetric quintessential state in the static coordinates reveals the outer horizons of de sitter kind at @xmath106 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we have calculated also the temperatures at horizons in some specific examples .    to the moment",
    "we have presented the problem with the quintessence itself being a perfect fluid with no physical motivations , so that the consideration has followed a general model - independent way . in practice , however , one usually handles a field - theoretical approach in terms of lagrangian formalism .",
    "so , the quintessence is treated as a scalar field with a specific potential and , probably , a kinetic term ( @xmath107-sense ) .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions in dimensionally reduced spacetimes were in detail investigated by mignemi and wiltshire in @xcite .",
    "in that study the vacuum einstein equations in @xmath108 dimensions @xmath109 are equivalent to the field equations for a scalar field coupled to the gravity in @xmath110 dimensions .",
    "this field has an exponential potential , which generally leads to the perfect fluid approximation with a variable state parameter .",
    "such the approximation is meaningful in the cosmological models of universe evolution .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that the no - hair theorem remains valid , while some non - trivial solutions ( not schwarzschild ones ) can be possible under non - flat asymptotics .",
    "the critical points leading to naked singularities were described .",
    "the consideration were further extended to the black holes in higher - derivative gravity theories by @xcite , wherein the authors classified all static spherically symmetric solutions of d - dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential consisting of a finite sum of exponential terms .",
    "the analysis for global properties of static spherically symmetric charged dilaton spacetimes with a liouville potential was done by poletti and wiltshire in @xcite .",
    "a treatment of scalar field in the context of dark matter and dark energy was developed in @xcite .",
    "so , the static solutions for the spherically symmetric scalar field were found for the description of flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies provided the potential of the field is exponential , while the energy density and presure behaves as @xmath111 with the distance .",
    "the properties of solutions are in agreement with the general analysis in @xcite .",
    "the problem of such the treatment is twofold .",
    "first , the potential has a negative sign in contrast to the cosmological applications .",
    "second , small rotation velocities lead to the extra compact dimension @xmath112 .",
    "nevertheless , authors of @xcite found that the origin of quintessence at the cosmological and galaxy scales could be significantly different .",
    "indeed , the flat rotation curves in the geodetic analysis make a preference for the quintessence with the state parameter @xmath113 in contrast to @xmath114 close to @xmath115 for the accelerating evolution of universe .",
    "so , the exponential potentials as well as the scalar fields responsible for the dark matter and dark energy can be different .",
    "next , the @xmath111-falling of energy - momentum tensor for the scalar field responsible for the flat rotation curves @xcite can be obtained in the general solution presented in this work by implementing the limit @xmath116 yielding @xmath117 while in @xcite one found @xmath118 in the limit of scalar field alone .",
    "we see that the physical contents of these two approaches can be similar if we suggest that the perfect fluid in the present paper is represented by a coherent state formed by a scalar field and a cold dark matter ( the pressure equals zero ) . of course",
    ", such the suggestion should be tested in a model way elsewhere .",
    "further , the angle surplus caused by the scalar field as found in @xcite can be obtained in the perfect fluid approach used , too .",
    "indeed , the limit of @xmath119 implies that the metric component @xmath120 tends to a constant value . therefore , we can rescale the definition of radius by @xmath121 , so that the sphere surface gets the angle defect ( surplus or deficit ) since its area becomes @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 .",
    "in addition , an interesting point is that in the case @xmath124 , which we have concerned with in section [ 2 ] , in the absence of a de sitter term the spacetime is not asymptotically flat but has an asymptotic defect angle , just as was noted for the model in ref .",
    "note , that in typical quintessence models the cosmological constant is omitted since the quintessence field is taken play the role of driving the acceleration of the universe at late times .",
    "if that is the case , then presumably the asymptotic properties of the solutions are also transparently changed , so that the inner horizons of free static spherically symmetric quintessence lead to a flat spacetime at infinity ( @xmath125 ) , while the outer horizons produce essentially non - flat asymptotics , though at typical values expected for the quintessence energy density the numbers involved might be so small that the effect is negligible for the real black hole formation until one does not touch the problem of halos in spiral galaxies .    finally ,",
    "zloshchastiev studied exactly soluble models of einstein  maxwell ",
    "dilaton gravity including the case of string - motivated prescriptions with the exponential potentials @xcite .",
    "his results cover the situation with both the black hole , which mass can include the logarithmic variation , and the electric charge varied logarithmically , too , if one suggests the flat limit of two - dimensional sphere .",
    "the horizons and hawking temperatures were also studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the perfect fluid under consideration of present work can be in some sense modelled by a scalar field with an exponential potential , probably , coupled to a cold dark matter . a motivation for",
    "the specific choice of parameter in the energy - momentum tensor of quintessence by the additivity and linearity condition may be twofold .",
    "first , such the choice matches the well - known limits as described .",
    "second , it allows us to consistently incorporate a back reaction of matter on the metrics . in detail , consider the black hole surrounded by the matter fields .",
    "the quantum corrections caused by the matter loops in the given external classical gravitational field , for instance , have to influence the metric , too .",
    "so , the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for the matter could be considered as a classical source of gravity .",
    "that is the case we consider in the present paper .",
    "hence , if we suggest validity of the correspondence principle implying the smooth limit of problem solution with a source to the probelm solution without the source , then we could expect a continous matching of two exact solutions with the source and without it .",
    "indeed , imagine we introduce a small amount of spherically symmetric matter in the field of black hole .",
    "one could expect that , by continuity , the exact solution with matter is close to the exact solution without the matter , i.e. , the black hole is not destroyed by a negligible amount of matter , including the case of perfect fluid with a negative presure we study .",
    "then , the matter with the negative presure should form a coherent perfect fluid state , in which the energy - momentum tensor under the spherical symmetry is given by the expression with the definite relation between the state parameter @xmath114 and the fraction of radial and isotropic spatial components . with another choice of relation between two spherically symmetric parts in the energy - momentum tensor of perfect fluid",
    ", the black hole metric will be crutially broken by a small amount of matter as was mentioned in the introduction , since , for instance , in the case of purely isotropic strength tensor one found solutions with no black hole at all . anyway ,",
    "if the state parameter is adiabatically varied with the distance in the field theory framework , the perfect fluid solution should give a meaningful approximation for the exact quantum state .",
    "this solution could be also an attractor of fluctuations in the real problem with a scalar field and a cold dark matter , which is a question for a study elsewhere .",
