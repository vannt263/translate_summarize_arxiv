    "the chromium dimer ( cr@xmath0 ) has attracted a lot of attention as a prototype to understand the @xmath1-@xmath1 binding in both experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the ground state is experimentally observed to be a singlet state , @xmath2@xcite , whereas the ground state of the constituent cr atom @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) has the highest spin multiplicity in the @xmath5 atoms .",
    "recent spectroscopic experiments reported an equilibrium bond length ( @xmath6 ) and binding energy ( @xmath7 ) of 1.6788  @xcite and 1.53 @xmath8 0.05 ev@xcite , respectively ( some older experiments reported @xmath6 of 1.68 @xcite and @xmath7 of 1.44 @xmath8 0.05 ev @xcite and 1.42 @xmath8 0.10 ev @xcite ) .",
    "however , no theoretical study has provided a quantitatively satisfactory result for cr@xmath0 so far , since its chemical binding is rather complicated .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "there are two extremely different pictures to understand the chemical binding in cr@xmath0 qualitatively . the first one is based on elementary molecular orbital ( mo ) theories . in this framework , cr@xmath0 is treated as a closed shell ( single - determinant ) state , with all the bonding orbitals occupied ( @xmath9 , arising from the @xmath5 and @xmath10 orbitals ) .",
    "cr@xmath0 is therefore interpreted as having a sextuple bond , which is the highest multiple bond in any diatomic molecule .",
    "this is naively consistent with the observed short bond length ( @xmath11 1.68  ) @xcite , whereas the experimental @xmath7 ( @xmath11 1.5 ev ) is rather small in the context of multiple bonds , which is smaller than that of singly bonded cu@xmath0 ( @xmath11 2.0 ev ) .",
    "this fact may imply that an elementary one - electron approximation picture is invalid for cr@xmath0 and hence  non - dynamical \" ( static ) correlation effects are important .",
    "indeed , restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) does not only give an incorrect dissociation behavior , but also gives rise to a ground state energy of cr@xmath0 far above that of the two isolated atoms ( about 20 ev higher)@xcite .    the second picture , which is the extreme opposite to the first one , emphasizes the relative stability of high - spin atomic states@xcite .",
    "this is the molecular analogue of antiferromagnetism and can be treated at the crudest level of theory by the unrestricted ( or broken symmetry ) hartree - fock ( uhf ) theory using a spin unrestricted single - determinant of symmetry broken molecular spin orbitals@xcite .",
    "the method can approximately deal with the static correlation effects .",
    "up and down - spin electrons are antiferromagnetically localized on each of the cr atoms , where the charge density has a @xmath12 symmetry but the spin density has a @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the wavefunction represents the nearest possible single - determinant approximation to the @xmath2 state , but it is not an eigenfunction of total spin , leading to spin contamination .",
    "this can be easily remedied by a properly symmetrized multi - determinant expansion of the uhf wavefunction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the generalized valence bond ( gvb ) method .",
    "however , the gvb method gives rise to a very weakly bound molecule ( @xmath14 ev ) with a very long bond length ( @xmath15 )@xcite .",
    "although a complete active space ( cas ) self - consistent field ( scf ) method can also consider the static correlation , a typical casscf with a 12 orbital active space and 12 active electrons , casscf(12,12 ) , provides a poor result of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , similar to gvb @xcite .",
    "these disagreements with experiments indicate dynamical correlation effects are also important for achieving quantitatively satisfactory results . in summary ,",
    "the chemical binding in cr@xmath0 involves a highly complicated blend of @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath5-@xmath5 interactions with antiferromagnetic coupling .    to understand such a complicated binding mechanism , a large number of _ ab initio _ studies",
    "have been performed based on either traditional mo theories@xcite or density functional theories ( dft ) @xcite . in mo ,",
    "both single- and multi - reference theories were studied . within the single - reference theory ,",
    "the coupled - cluster approach with single and double excitations including triples noniteratively , ccsd(t ) , is one of the most accurate methods .",
    "restricted ccsd(t ) calculations give a very weak binding ( @xmath16 ev ) with a short bond length ( @xmath17  ) , whereas unrestricted ccsd(t ) calculations provide a better binding energy ( @xmath18 ev ) , but with a longer bond length ( @xmath19  ) . in multi - reference theories ,",
    "a typical reference is a casscf(12,12 ) calculation which is responsible for the static correlation . using the cas reference ,",
    "dynamical correlation can be taken into account by multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci)@xcite , coupled cluster ( mrcc)@xcite , or second - order perturbation ( caspt2 ) methods@xcite . although these multi - reference methods give a better @xmath6 than single - reference methods , there is still room to improve further the accuracy of @xmath7 .    in dft , various exchange - correlation ( xc )",
    "functionals are available such as the local ( spin ) density approximation ( lda / lsda ) , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , as well as the hybrid xc functionals .",
    "both restricted lda ( rlda ) and the unrestricted formalism ( ulda ) give rise to overbinding , _",
    "i.e. _ , too short @xmath6 and too large @xmath7 @xcite , which is a well - known failure of lda .",
    "both restricted and unrestricted gga calculations@xcite generally improve the lda discrepancy , but it is difficult to choose the  best \" gga functional because one may give a better @xmath6 , but it may give a worse @xmath7 , and vice versa .",
    "restricted b3lyp , though it is popular for covalent molecules , gives rise to an unbound molecular state@xcite .",
    "although unrestricted b3lyp reproduces a bound state , it provides a smaller @xmath7 of @xmath20 ev with much larger @xmath6 of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these results may imply that the difficulties for the binding of cr@xmath0 would originate from a delicate balance between exchange and correlation in dft for chemical binding of cr@xmath0 .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite are one of the most accurate techniques in state - of - the - art _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for quantitative descriptions of electronic structures .",
    "there are two typical qmc calculations , _ i.e. _ , variational and diffusion monte carlo ( vmc and dmc ) methods .",
    "vmc is not usually accurate enough since its result strongly depends on the correlated trial wavefunction adopted .",
    "dmc is a technique for numerically solving the many- electron schdinger equation for stationary states using imaginary time evolution .",
    "the fixed - node approximation is usually assumed to maintain the fermionic anti - symmetry in dmc .",
    "although the fixed - node dmc can accurately evaluate the ground state energy of many atoms and molecules using only the trial node from a single determinant ( sd ) , it sometimes fails , especially for  near - degeneracy \" systems such as the be atom .",
    "this implies that the fixed - node dmc method can work well for the dynamic correlation , but not for the static correlation which should be included at the stage of choosing the fixed - node trial wavefunction . the cr@xmath0 molecule is also considered as a near - degeneracy molecular system and hence a good challenge to qmc .    in this study we performed vmc and dmc calculations of cr@xmath0 with several choice of trial wavefunctions .",
    "variety of the xc functionals are examined to construct orbital functions including hf , svwn lda , pw91 and blyp gga , b1lyp and b3lyp hybrid functionals , with both restricted and unrestricted treatments .",
    "in addition to a single - determinant form of the many - body wavefunction , we also tried several multi - determinant ( md ) forms .",
    "for the orbital part we also introduced the backflow transformation @xcite .",
    "performance of the xc functionals are examined based on the variational principle with respect to the fixed node @xcite .",
    "the chemical binding of the ground - state cr@xmath0 may be examined in two ways : ( i ) use of the binding curve and ( ii ) a comparison of atomic and molecular energies .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the present computational methods .",
    "section iii provides numerical results and discussion .",
    "section iv summarizes the present study .",
    "we replaced the inner neon core ( 10 core electrons ) of the cr atom with a small core norm - conserving pseudopotential which is constructed from dirac - fock atomic solutions .",
    "more specifically we employed the lee - needs ( ln ) soft pseudopotential @xcite using troullier - martins construction . to check the dependence on the potential we also used a small core burkatzki - filippi - dolg ( bfd ) pseudopotential  @xcite .",
    "an electronic many - body wavefunction is composed of anti - symmetrized products of orbital functions which is generated from dft or hf .",
    "various xc functionals give different orbitals from which different structures of the nodal surface @xcite of the many - body wavefunction ( the surface in configuration space on which the wavefunction is zero and across which it changes sign ) are constructed . for different nodal structures",
    ", we can exploit the variational principle to see which choice is better , comparing the ground state energy@xcite . in this study we tested several combinations of ( i ) the choice of xc , ( ii ) spin restricted / unrestricted treatment of orbitals , ( iii ) sd / md , ( iv ) choice of pseudopotentials , and ( v ) with / without backflow degrees of freedom@xcite .    in vmc",

    "except hf , the unrestricted nodes are found to be better than the restricted ones .",
    "any choice gives binding curves with a energy minimum , but for unrestricted trial nodes they end up with a much larger @xmath6 and smaller @xmath7 in the qmc final results , compared with the experimental values . though some unrestricted dft - scf calculations , such as ulda and ugga , reproduce a proper @xmath6 , it is found that the qmc calculations with these trial nodes overestimate @xmath6 .",
    "the restricted nodes recover fairly well @xmath6 even at qmc , but they give a higher energy than the unrestricted ones . at the experimental @xmath6 , we could not get a stable molecular energy lower than twice the atomic energy at the qmc level , although some dft - scf calculations did reproduce a bound state .",
    "we also examined whether the binding curve could be improved by different pseudopotentials , comparing the bfd potential with the ln one .",
    "both potentials give almost the same binding curve , which justifies our choice of pseudopotentials .",
    "the time step bias is confirmed to be kept within the error bar considered in this study .",
    "the backflow transformation turned out to give no specific improvements on describing the binding nature , although it did improve the energy variationally .    within the framework of the md approximation , we first tried the gvb model as a compact expansion for the many - body wavefunction because of its plausible physical meaning .",
    "starting with hf orbitals , we optimized the gvb orbitals and coefficients by a scf procedure , but it could not give a better result than the unrestricted sd in the dmc final results , probably because the restricted treatment has a limitation in describing the spin polarized nature in cr@xmath0 .",
    "we also run dmc using the trial nodes derived from a restricted md expansion with orbitals optimized by casscf , but it ends up with a worse qmc result than the unrestricted dft - sd nodes . though the restricted casscf itself gives a too large @xmath6 similar to the unrestricted dft calculations , the qmc calculations with the casscf nodes give properly shorten @xmath6 near to the experimental value .",
    "then we decided to use the unrestricted ci nodes .",
    "first , we chose such excited configurations as those with a large coefficient weight and re - optimized the coefficients .",
    "vmc with this trial wavefunction gives a lower energy than that with the ub3lyp one . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding dmc calculation gives a higher energy than dmc using the ub3lyp nodes .",
    "next , we manually constructed a uci expansion with ub3lyp orbitals and optimized their coefficients . though the uci - md node gives a better dmc result than the ub3lyp - sd one , it gives no improvements on the binding natures , _",
    "i.e. _ , it still overestimates @xmath6 and underestimate @xmath7 .",
