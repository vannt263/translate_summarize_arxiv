    "the shape of galactic spiral arms is usually logarithmic in nature and independent of scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the best geometric measures to represent spiral arms is the pitch angle , @xmath31 , defined as the angle between the line tangent to a circle and the line tangent to a logarithmic spiral at a specified radius .",
    "we present in figure  [ fig2 ] the deprojected co(21 ) distribution , as well as a best fit representation of a logarithmic spiral pattern with pitch angle @xmath31 = 20@xmath10 .",
    "we used a set of models of bisymmetric spiral arms with an inclination of 70@xmath10 .",
    "we varied the pitch angles in steps of 10@xmath10 from 10 to 60@xmath10 , and found that @xmath31 = 20@xmath10 fitted best .",
    "this pitch angle is within the expected range for late type spirals @xcite for a maximum rotation velocity for cen  a of @xmath32 @xmath6 300  .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show a comparison between the co(21 ) and mid - ir 24@xmath33 m emission obtained with spitzer @xcite , with resolutions of about 6 , which complements figure  [ fig1 ] with its mid - ir 8@xmath33 m emission . in general the molecular gas distribution",
    "is similar to that of the dust emission .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "a warped and thin disk model is usually used to reproduce the observed properties at large scales ( @xmath81  kpc ) , especially the 3   parallelogram structure seen in dust emission @xcite . however , the morphology of co(21 ) emission resembles better spiral arms rather than a parallelogram structure .",
    "this rules out the single contribution of a homogeneous disk , otherwise we would also see filaments to the ne and sw of the circumnuclear gas , as the warped and thin disk model predicts that they are of comparable brightness as the observed nw and se filaments ( see for example figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this can not be explained by flux loss due to missing spacings . from the model",
    ", these filaments should have sizes less than 10 , similar compactness than the filaments to the ne an sw , and thus they would have been detected .",
    "therefore , we interpret the two co(21 ) filamentary structures as spiral arms .",
    "their main properties are similar to those found in disk galaxies : they are trailing , the linear widths are a few hundred parsecs , and the pitch angle is typical of spiral galaxies .",
    "this provides evidence that spiral arms can develop within a giant elliptical if enough cold gas exists .",
    "however , note that the molecular gas properties in the spiral arms might be considerably different to those in spiral galaxies , as it coexists within a triaxial potential and the stellar surface density changes more abruptly with radius in the case of a giant elliptical .",
    "a consequence of the compression produced by these spiral arms is that it is expected to trigger star formation ( sf ) on the leading edge .",
    "this is consistent with abundant sf traced by pa@xmath7 @xcite for example , coincident at least with the southern molecular spiral arm ( nearest part and thus likely the least obscured ) .",
    "the spiral features seen in the @xmath0co emission is also associated with the distribution of certain tracers observed in poorer angular / spectral resolution maps , such as the scuba 450@xmath33 m emission map in @xcite , as well as the pure rotational line of molecular hydrogen h@xmath34 ( j=20 ) s(0 ) ( @xmath35 m ) emission observed with spitzer / irs by @xcite .",
    "the molecular hydrogen transition h@xmath34 ( j=20 ) s(0 ) indicates the presence of gas with t @xmath2 200  k @xcite , which is likely tracing photodissociation regions associated with abundant star formation .",
    "a small perturbation could have triggered this spirality , such as a non - axisymmetric weak potential ( paper i ) or a minor merger after the disk was relatively well settled ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the structure and kinematics",
    "we infer that the formation of spiral arms took place in less than 0.3  gyr @xcite , which is likely the most accurate measure of time at our disposal since is one of the most sensitive components of interaction .",
    "although evidence suggests that spiral arms are transient @xcite , recent simulations claim that spiral structures may be long lived @xcite .",
    "3-d self - gravitating models for late type spirals suggest that the pitch angle we find here would correspond to a long - lasting feature , because the density response tends to avoid larger pitch angles @xcite .",
    "similar simulations in the deep potentials of giant ellipticals would be needed to investigate the response of the gas .",
    "the study of the properties of recently accreted molecular gas in the deep potential wells of elliptical galaxies is a powerful tool in disentangling how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "recent smoothed - particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) cosmological simulations in the @xmath36 cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario @xcite are able to reproduce most of the properties of disks @xcite at the current epoch , including their fine structure morphology , the observed angular momentum , the tully - fisher relation , and the sfr to gas surface density ratio ( kennicutt - schmidt ) . however , to understand galaxy evolution it is essential to anchor these simulations with the actual properties of nascent disk galaxies .",
    "the properties of disks , in particular the existence of spiral arms , in these systems which are in the early stages following significant accretion can be compared with numerical simulations . not only can we compare the observed gas distribution and kinematics of recently formed disks to models , but also the effect of sf and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback in the disk evolution . moreover , with the advent of alma",
    ", it is now possible to validate theories of disk formation as they enter a deep gravitational potential , performing similar studies in objects along the evolutionary sequence of accreted gas in dust lane ellipticals @xcite , from systems whose gas is still irregularly distributed to more evolved and settled disks such as in cen  a.                                                                            m observed by spitzer ( red , * ? ? ?",
