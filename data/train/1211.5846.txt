    "ultracold heteronuclear alkali dimers have enjoyed extensive attention from researchers in fields ranging from atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics to physical chemistry and chemical physics for over a decade now @xcite .",
    "the presence of a large molecule - fixed electric dipole moment in the absolute rovibrational ground state @xmath9 makes external control over the motion and internal quantum state very convenient , opening up the fields of ultracold chemical reactions and collisions @xcite , many body physics @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . to date , polar molecules in the @xmath10 level of the ground state have been successfully achieved by 1 ) magnetoassociation or photoassociation ( pa ) followed by stimulated raman transfer in krb @xcite and rbcs @xcite and 2 ) photoassociation followed by direct radiative decay in lics @xcite and nacs @xcite . although the first technique can efficiently transfer a selectively prepared sample of vibrationally excited ultracold molecules to the lowest rovibronic level , the appeal of the second technique is that it provides a simple , single - step , continuous and irreversible process for converting ultracold atoms into molecules in the lowest rovibronic level .",
    "ultracold krb molecules , with a dipole moment of 0.66 debye in the lowest rovibronic level , have been a favorite choice among the amo community . in this letter",
    "we report a new single - step pa pathway for the formation of ultracold krb molecules in the lowest vibrational levels of @xmath6 , @xmath11 , starting from laser cooled @xmath2k and @xmath3rb atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "pa paired with radiative decay has served as a very popular technique for producing ultracold molecules , normally in the highest vibrational levels of the electronic ground state @xcite . however , to enhance the formation of ground - state molecules in vibrational levels far below the dissociation limit , it is possible to photoassociate to a rovibrational level of a single or a coupled excited electronic state with a radial probability distribution that includes both a long - range peak and a short - range peak .",
    "the long - range peak ensures efficient pa while the short range peak ensures efficient spontaneous radiative decay to low - lying levels .",
    "such states occur if there is a strong resonant coupling between specific vibrational levels of two appropriate excited electronic states .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in rb@xmath12 @xcite , cs@xmath12 @xcite , rbcs @xcite and is theoretically predicted for many heteronuclear dimers @xcite . in nacs @xcite , this phenomenon is believed to lead the formation of molecules in the rovibronic ground state . in our present work , we have discovered a pair of states in krb that are resonantly coupled , the 2(1 ) and 4(1 ) states .",
    "we perform extensive pa and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) spectroscopy on the coupled states and the molecules formed from these states .",
    "these spectra have revealed the formation of ultracold krb molecules in their lowest rovibrational levels .",
    "our work presents a more complete experimental characterization of the resonant coupling of levels for formation of the lowest levels of the @xmath13 ground state .",
    "a complete theoretical understanding is of course also desirable , but difficult given the many coupled electronic states involved in krb .",

    "the @xmath19 state correlates to the 4(1 ) state and dissociates to the k@xmath14 + rb@xmath20 asymptote while the @xmath16 state diabatically correlates to the 2(1 ) and @xmath21 states and dissociates to the k@xmath14 + rb@xmath15 asymptote.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "a detailed description of the experimental apparatus is available in @xcite .",
    "briefly , it consists of overlapped dual species mots of @xmath2k and @xmath3rb , operating in a `` dark - spot '' configuration @xcite , with atomic densities of @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the temperatures of the k and rb mots are on the order of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . a cw titanium : sapphire ring laser focused at the mot with power of about 1 w acts as the pa laser .",
    "the molecules thus formed by pa then radiatively decay to the _ x _ and _ a _ states correlating with two ground - state atoms and are detected via rempi .",
    "the rempi laser is a continuum model nd6000 pulsed dye laser and produces 10 ns pulses of @xmath271 mj energy that are focused to a diameter ( fwhm ) of @xmath27 0.76 mm at the mot .",
    "the ions are then detected by a channeltron and the krb@xmath28 ion signal is distinguished from k@xmath28 , rb@xmath28 , k@xmath29 and rb@xmath29 ions by time - of - flight mass spectroscopy .",
    "pa spectra are obtained by scanning the cw laser while keeping the pulsed rempi laser fixed on a particular resonance .",
    "similarly rempi spectra are obtained by scanning the pulsed laser while fixing the pa laser on a known resonance .",

    "are observed about @xmath270.3 @xmath32 apart .",
    "these are identified as @xmath36 of @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath39 , using hund s caes c ) notation . in earlier work @xcite",
    ", these two states were observed using a pulsed rempi laser with significantly broader linewidth and considerable amplified spontaneous emission , thus degrading the state selectivity but with the advantage of locating all pa resonances with some efficiency . in the present work",
    "pa spectra are obtained via rempi using a narrow bandwidth ( 0.5 @xmath32 ) laser with a well - defined frequency .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that the long - range 2(1 ) , @xmath36 level should radiatively decay predominantly to high-@xmath7 levels of the _ x _ state .",
    "similarly the intermediate - range 4(1 ) , @xmath38 level should emit predominantly to low-@xmath7 levels of the _ x _ state .",
    "however , the pa spectra in figure 2 reveal a different picture .",
    "although figure 2a corresponds to detection of high-@xmath7 levels and figure 2b to low-@xmath7 levels of the ground - state , both have the same ratios of 2(1 ) and 4(1 ) signals for all the _ j _ values .",
    "this suggests that the pair of excited states is strongly mixed by perturbative coupling .",

    "the detection laser frequency for all the pa scans is 16635.8 @xmath32 .",
    "also , as the scan speeds and laser powers were not closely matched , we do not consider the differences in the linewidths to be significant.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 3 depicts the behavior of the rotational constants for these two levels .",
    "the topmost ( 4(1 ) , @xmath38 ) and bottom - most(2(1 ) , @xmath36 ) lines depict theoretical prediction of @xmath43 based on single channel calculations .",
    "the experimental results depicted by the middle two lines deviate significantly towards one another , as expected in case of resonant coupling .",
    "the values of @xmath43 for 4(1 ) , @xmath38 and 2(1 ) , @xmath36 are quite similar and each deviates significantly from the single channel calculations or from simple linear interpolation between neighboring vibrational levels .",
    "this observation again suggests that these two excited states are strongly mixed .",
    "we also note that if they are strongly mixed , their hyperfine structure ( hfs ) should be quite similar .",
    "this is indeed observed , as can be seen in figure 4 for superposed plots of the hfs for @xmath44 and 3 .",
    "the vibrational numbering of the 4(1 ) electronic state is absolute .",
    "this state was previously observed by kasahara _",
    "@xcite in an optical - optical double resonance experiment for higher values of _ j _ and was later observed by our group @xcite for lower values of _",
    "j_. however , the vibrational numbering of the long - range state of 2(1 ) is slightly uncertain . in previous work by our group @xcite",
    ", we observed many vibrational levels of 2(1 ) state , but not all .",
    "based on a long - range extrapolation to the dissociation limit @xcite , we can definitively state that the 2(1 ) vibrational level in the present experiment is the 22@xmath45 level below the dissociation limit . calculating the vibrational levels of 2(1 ) state using the level program @xcite and the single - channel potential @xcite , we find that the energy of the @xmath36 calculated level corresponds closely to our experimental vibrational level .",
    "hence , for ease of discussion we will denote this vibrational level of the 2(1 ) state to be @xmath36 .",
    "0 mm ( color online)near - identical rempi spectra of krb with the pa laser at a ) 12547.6 @xmath32 and b ) 12547.9 @xmath32 .",
    "the line marked by an asterisk represents the detection frequency of 16635.8 @xmath32 used for the pa scans in figure 2a and 4 .",
    "note that the intensity scales in a and b are the same.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0 mm     this mixing between 2(1 ) and 4(1 ) is even more apparent in the rempi spectra of the _ x _ and _ a _ state molecules formed by radiative decay of the coupled pa states .",
    "these spectra are obtained by scanning the ionization laser with the pa laser fixed at 12547.62 @xmath46 ) and then at 12547.92 @xmath47 ) , shown in figure 5 .",
    "these spectra are extremely congested and hence quite challenging to assign . nevertheless comparing",
    "the two spectra reveals that they share the same spectral lines for the entire 400 @xmath32 scan except for six random peaks ( out of @xmath27110 reproducible peaks ) . for many years , in our group , we have studied rempi spectra , which are usually very different for different electronic states .",
    "we have never observed two rempi spectra arising from two different electronic states with such striking similarity .",
    "this implies a strong coupling between the participating electronic excited states and suggests that these coupled states are nearly an equal admixture of the 2(1 ) and 4(1 ) electronic states at least in the range of internuclear separations for which radiative decay to bound levels of the ground state is significant .",
    "this degree of mixing has not been observed or predicted in prior work on ultracold molecules , as far as we know .",
    "in an attempt to better understand the vibrational distribution of ground state molecules formed via these coupled excited states , we performed rempi scans from @xmath2715000 - 15300 @xmath32 , which is significantly below the scan range shown in figure 5 , since in that region the number of intermediate state resonances is fewer and hence the spectra are expected to be less complex .    0 mm ( color online)an expanded view of a selected region of the detection spectrum ( figure 6 ) of krb molecules . the red vertical lines ( bottom )",
    "indicate ground state molecules detected via the @xmath48 state and the blue vertical lines ( top ) indicate those detected via the @xmath49 state .",
    "the @xmath50 corresponds to the intermediate state ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 in the present case ) vibrational levels and @xmath7 corresponds to that of the ground @xmath13 state .",
    "the green vertical lines ( middle ) correspond to the detection of molecules in @xmath51 via the @xmath52 , @xmath53 state . in the region of the spectrum shown in this figure nine lines ( above the 4.5 vertical threshold )",
    "are assigned , while three are still unassigned.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the spectrum thus obtained , as shown in figure 6 , is still rather congested but nearly all of the lines have been successfully assigned .",
    "the assignments include numerous transitions from the lowest lying vibrational levels @xmath11 of the @xmath13 state , as well as from the levels @xmath54 . in figure 6",
    ", we have shown only the transitions from @xmath55 to the intermediate levels with the intention to avoid excessive congestion of assignments .",
    "the low-_v _ ground - state molecules , as observed by rempi through the @xmath56 and @xmath49 excited electronic states , have been studied extensively in very recent molecular beam experiments @xcite .",
    "thus the vibrational energies of the ground state and intermediate states used to assign the rempi spectra are all well known from experiments and hence there is very little uncertainty in the assignments of our spectra .",
    "also , we have only assigned the lines in the rempi spectrum which can be detected via the vibrational levels of the intermediate states already observed in @xcite . as a result , there are a few lines that are still unassigned .    in order to provide a cleaner view of the dense spectrum , we show in figure 7 an expanded view of the spectrum in figure 6 focusing on the region @xmath2715105 - 15137 @xmath32 . in this region , lines can be assigned to transitions from @xmath57 levels to various vibrational levels of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 states .",
    "transitions corresponding to the lowest triplet state are also shown .",
    "however , in this region , no distinct lines can be assigned to the @xmath19 state . as is evident from the figure ,",
    "there are still some unassigned lines in this region .",
    "these are likely to be transitions to vibrational levels of the same intermediate states beyond the range reported in @xcite .",
    "further evidence that krb molecules are formed in the lowest lying vibrational levels of the ground state comes from our observation of very large krb@xmath28 signals ionized using only a 532 nm pulsed laser . for molecules in high vibrational levels of the ground state , single - color ionization at 532 nm was previously observed to be quite inefficient . for @xmath58 , the situation is much different because of a near resonance with the @xmath59 level , which enhances two - photon ionization .",
    "because the vibrational spacings are very similar in the _ x _ and the @xmath52 states , other _ x _ , low @xmath7 levels are also enhanced .",
    "the relative intensities of the rempi intermediate states are also of interest .",
    "the spin selection rule @xmath60 forbids transitions between singlet and triplet electronic states , so the @xmath48@xmath61@xmath13 transitions might be expected to be very weak .",
    "however , as is evident in figure 6 , the @xmath48@xmath61@xmath13 transitions are actually nearly as strong as the singlet - singlet rempi transitions .",
    "similarly efficient transitions between these two states are also reported in @xcite .",
    "this occurs because there are five excited electronic states in this energy region , @xmath62 and @xmath49 , which undergo mutual perturbations at various internuclear distances .",
    "this gives rise to very complicated coupling and hence the participating states are often not of pure singlet or triplet character .",
    "this is probably facilitating not only the detection of the lowest vibrational levels of @xmath13 via the @xmath48 state in krb with very good efficiency @xcite , but also the formation of these low - lying vibrational states by resonant coupling . at small internuclear distances the 2(1 )",
    "state correlates to the @xmath48 state and the 4(1 ) state correlates to @xmath19 .",
    "hence the long range states 2(1)@xmath274(1 ) used for pa are themselves participants in this five - state perturbation complex , so that further study may reveal the influence of other nearby states on this strongly coupled pair .    to estimate the formation rate of @xmath63 level via photoassociation , we calibrated the ion signal to determine the number of krb@xmath28 ions / pulse . taking the velocity of the krb molecules as @xmath270.3 m / sec based on the mot temperature of @xmath64k and estimating a detection volume of 0.45 mm@xmath65 determined by the pulsed laser diameter of 0.76 mm and the nominal mot thickness of 0.1 mm , the production rate of molecules in @xmath66 state is approximately @xmath8 molecules / second .",
    "comparing with other recent results using single - step pa alone , this production rate is of the same order as the results @xcite for lics and about a factor of ten smaller than for nacs @xcite .",
    "the main caveat in using a single - step photoassociation process rather than a method of coherent transfer is the unwanted population of various higher vibrational levels due to spontaneous radiative decay . however a pure sample of rovibrational ground state molecules is still achievable after the pa process by several possible methods .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , vibrational cooling of the sample is one option . for krb molecules ,",
    "the @xmath67 complex can provide intermediate states for optical pumping of molecules in higher vibrational levels down to @xmath66 .",
    "another option for obtaining a pure sample of absolute ground state molecules is to photodissociate the vibrationally excited molecules , so that the residue is a pure sample of @xmath66 .",
    "this process has been previously carried out successfully for k@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "either method can be efficient , so the choice between them depends to some extent on the availability of suitable lasers .",
    "in summary , we have presented a simple , single - step path for the efficient formation of krb molecules in the @xmath66 level of the @xmath13 state via photoassociation through a pair of strongly resonantly coupled levels of the 2(1)@xmath274(1 ) excited electronic states .",
    "the process forms @xmath68 krb molecules / second in the @xmath66 level of the ground state .",
    "it achieves this with just a single laser and works well at typical uncompressed mot densities , with atomic temperatures of a few hundred @xmath69k .",
    "further gains might be achieved by purifying the vibrational distribution into the @xmath66 level and optically trapping them to allow studies of collisions and interactions .",
    "this process provides continuous production and accumulation of the absolute ground state molecules without complicated transfer techniques .",
    "finally the observation of suitable pairs of resonantly coupled states for krb , together with related observations in lics , nacs and rbcs , inspires confidence that similar pathways can be found for other heteronulcear molecules as predicted in @xcite ."
