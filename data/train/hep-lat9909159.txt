    "it is known that there is a large mixing of lattice heavy - light axial current with higher dimensional operators in the static limit and in nrqcd  @xcite , which gives significant decrease of @xmath4 .",

    "we compute the mixing coefficients with higher dimensional operators in lattice theory for various cases of practial use in heavy - light system , i.e : ( 1 ) for @xmath5 with rg - improved gauge action ( 2 ) for @xmath5 with heavy - clover action in fermilab interpretation  @xcite , and ( 3 ) for @xmath2 which is needed to extract the width difference of @xmath6 meson .",
    "improved action has advantages in simulations with dynamical quarks , when one is forced to use coarse lattices due to the lack of computational power .",
