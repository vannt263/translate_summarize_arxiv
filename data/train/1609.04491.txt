    "in past decades , there have been tremendous efforts on designing high - order accurate numerical schemes for compressible fluid flows and great success has been achieved .",
    "high - order accurate numerical schemes were pioneered by lax and wendroff @xcite , and extended into the version of high resolution methods by kolgan @xcite , boris @xcite , van leer @xcite , harten @xcite et al , and other higher order versions , such as essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) @xcite , weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) @xcite , discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) @xcite methods etc .    in the past decades",
    ", the evaluation of the performance of numerical scheme was mostly based on the test cases with strong shocks for capturing sharp shock transition , such as the blast wave interaction , the forward step - facing flows , and the double mach reflection @xcite .",
    "now it is not a problem at all for shock capturing scheme to get stable sharp shock transition .",
    "however , with the further development of higher order numerical methods and practical demands ( such as turbulent flow simulations ) , more challenging test problems for capturing multiple wave structure are expected to be used . for testing higher - order schemes , the setting of these cases should be sufficiently simple and easy for coding , and avoid the possible pollution from the boundary condition and curvilinear meshes . to introduce a few tests which can be truthfully used to evaluate the performance of higher - order scheme",
    "is the motivation for the current paper .",
    "our selected examples include the following : one - dimensional cases , two - dimensional riemann problems , and the conservation law with source terms .",
    "for the one - dimensional problems , the first case is a highly oscillatory shock - turbulence interaction problem , which is the extension of shu - osher problem by titarev and toro @xcite with much more severe oscillations , and the second one is a large density ratio problem with a very strong rarefaction wave in the solution @xcite , which is used to test how a numerical scheme capture strong waves .",
    "for the two - dimensional cases , four groups are tested .",
    "( i ) hurricane - like solutions @xcite , which are highly nontrivial two - dimensional time - dependent solutions with one - point vacuum in the center and rotational velocity field .",
    "it is proposed to test the preservation of positivity and symmetry of the numerical scheme .",
    "( ii ) the interaction of planar contact discontinuities for different mach numbers .",
    "the multidimensional contact discontinuities are the composite of entropy waves and vortex sheets .",
    "the simulation of such cases have difficulties due to the strong shear effects .",
    "since the large mach number limits for these cases have explicit solutions @xcite , they are proposed here in order to check the ability of the current scheme for capturing wave structures of various scales and the asymptotic property .",
    "( iii ) interaction of planar rarefaction waves with the transition from continuous fluid flows to the presence of shocks .",
    "( iv ) further interaction of planar shocks showing the mach reflection phenomenon .",
    "these two - dimensional problems fall into the category of two - dimensional riemann problems proposed in @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional riemann problems reveal almost all substantial wave patterns of shock reflections , spiral formations , vortex - shock interactions and so on , through the simple classification of initial data .",
    "the rich wave configurations conjectured in @xcite have been confirmed numerically by several subsequent works @xcite .",
    "since the formulation of these problems are extremely simple , there is no need of complicated numerical boundary treatment and they are suitable as benchmark tests . the case for the conservation law with source term",
    "is also proposed .    in order to provide reference solutions for all these test cases .",
    "a gas - kinetic scheme will be used to calculate the solutions in this paper .",
    "recently , based on the time - dependent flux function of the generalized riemann problem ( grp ) solver @xcite , a two - stage fourth - order time - accurate discretization was developed for lax - wendroff type flow solvers , particularly applied for the hyperbolic conservation laws @xcite .",
    "the reason for the success of a two - stage l - w type time stepping method in achieving a fourth - order temporal accuracy is solely due to the use of both flux function and its temporal derivative . in terms of the gas evolution model , the gas - kinetic scheme provides a temporal accurate flux function as well , even though it depends on time through a much more complicated relaxation process from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic scale physics than the time - dependent flux function of grp . based on this time - stepping method and the second - order gas - kinetic solver @xcite ,",
    "a fourth - order gas - kinetic scheme was constructed for the euler and navier - stokes equations @xcite . in comparison with the formal one - stage time - stepping third - order gas - kinetic solver @xcite ,",
    "the fourth - order scheme not only reduces the complexity of the flux function , but also improves the accuracy of the scheme , even though the third - order and fourth - order schemes take similar computation cost .",
    "the robustness of the fourth - order gas - kinetic scheme is as good as the second - order one .",
    "numerical tests show that the fourth - order scheme not only has the expected order of accuracy for the smooth flows , but also has favorable shock capturing property for the discontinuous solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will briefly review the fourth - order gas - kinetic scheme . in section 3 ,",
    "we select several groups of problems to show the performance of the scheme .",
    "the final conclusion is made in the last section .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review our recently developed two - stage fourth - order gas - kinetic scheme .",
    "this scheme is developed in the framework of finite volume scheme , and it contains three standard ingredients : spatial data reconstruction , two - stage time stepping discretization , and second - order gas - kinetic flux function .",
    "the spatial reconstruction for the gas - kinetic scheme contains two parts , i.e. initial data reconstruction and reconstruction for equilibrium .    in this paper , the fifth - order weno method @xcite is used for the initial data reconstruction .",
    "assume that @xmath0 are the macroscopic flow variables that need to be reconstructed .",
    "@xmath1 are the cell averaged values , and @xmath2 are the two values obtained by the reconstruction at two ends of the @xmath3-th cell . the fifth - order weno reconstruction is given as follows @xmath4 where all quantities involved are taken as @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the nonlinear weights .",
    "the most widely used is the weno - js non - linear weights @xcite , which can be written as follows @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the smooth indicator , and the basic idea for its construction can be found in @xcite . in order to achieve a better performance of the weno scheme near smooth extrema",
    ", weno - z @xcite and weno - z+ @xcite reconstruction were developed .",
    "the only difference is the nonlinear weights .",
    "the nonlinear weights for the weno - z method is written as @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the nonlinear weights for the weno - z+ method is @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the same local smoothness indicator as in @xcite , @xmath12 is used for the fifth - order reconstruction , and @xmath13 is a parameter for fine - tuning the size of the weight of less smooth stencils . in the numerical tests , without special statement ,",
    "weno - js method will be used for initial data reconstruction .",
    "after the initial date reconstruction , the reconstruction of equilibrium part is presented .",
    "for the cell interface @xmath14 , the reconstructed variables at both sides of the cell interface are denoted as @xmath15 . according to the compatibility condition , which will be given later",
    ", the macroscopic variables at the cell interface is obtained and denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "the conservative variables around the cell interface can be expanded as @xmath17 with the following conditions , @xmath18 the derivatives are given by @xmath19/\\delta x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the two - stage fourth - order temporal discretization was developed for lax - wendroff flow solvers , and was originally applied for the generalized riemann problem solver ( grp ) @xcite for hyperbolic equations . in @xcite ,",
    "multi - stage multi - derivative time stepping methods were proposed and developed as well under different framework of flux evaluation .",
    "consider the following time - dependent equation @xmath20 with the initial condition at @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an operator for spatial derivative of flux .",
    "the time derivatives are obtained using the cauchy - kovalevskaya method , @xmath24 introducing an intermediate state at @xmath25 , @xmath26 the corresponding time derivatives are obtained as well for the intermediate stage state , @xmath27 then , a fourth - order temporal accuracy solution of @xmath28 at @xmath29 can be provided by the following equation @xmath30 the details of this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , a fourth - order temporal accuracy can be achieved by the two - stage discretization eq . and",
    "eq ..    consider the following conservation laws @xmath31 the semi - discrete form of a finite volume scheme can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the cell averaged conservative variables , @xmath34 are the fluxes at the cell interface @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the cell size . with the temporal derivatives of the flux ,",
    "the two - stage fourth - order scheme can be developed @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the conservation laws with source terms @xmath37 the corresponding operator can be denoted as @xmath38 the two - stage fourth - order temporal discretization can be directly extended for conservation laws with source terms .",
    "the two - dimensional bgk equation @xcite can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gas distribution function , @xmath41 is the corresponding equilibrium state , and @xmath42 is the collision time .",
    "the collision term satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is number of internal freedom , i.e. @xmath47 for two - dimensional flows , and @xmath48 is the specific heat ratio .    to update the flow variables in the finite volume framework , the integral solution of bgk equation eq .",
    "is used to construct the gas distribution function at a cell interface , which can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the location of the cell interface , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the trajectory of particles , @xmath53 is the initial gas distribution function , and @xmath41 is the corresponding equilibrium state .",
    "the time dependent integral solution at the cell interface @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath54h(u)\\nonumber\\\\ + & e^{-t/\\tau}g_l[1-(\\tau+t)(a_{1l}u+a_{2l}v)-\\tau a_l)](1-h(u)).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] based on the spatial reconstruction of macroscopic flow variables , which is presented before , the conservative variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the left and right hand sides of a cell interface , and the corresponding equilibrium states @xmath57 and @xmath58 , can be determined .",
    "the conservative variables @xmath59 and the equilibrium state @xmath60 at the cell interface can be determined according to the compatibility condition eq . as follows @xmath61 the coefficients related to the spatial derivatives and time derivative @xmath62 and @xmath63 in gas distribution function eq . can be determined according to the spatial derivatives and compatibility condition .",
    "more details of the gas - kinetic scheme can be found in @xcite .    as mentioned in the section before , in order to utilize the two - stage temporal discretization , the temporal derivatives of the flux function need to be determined .",
    "while in order to obtain the temporal derivatives at @xmath21 and @xmath64 with the correct physics , the flux function should be approximated as a linear function of time within the time interval .",
    "let s first introduce the following notation , @xmath65 in the time interval @xmath66 $ ] , the flux is expanded as the following linear form @xmath67 the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be fully determined as follows @xmath70 similarly , @xmath71 for the intermediate stage @xmath72 can be constructed as well .",

    "more details about the implementation of the fourth - order gas - kinetic scheme can be found in @xcite .",
