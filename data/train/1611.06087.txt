    "oscillations of properties similar to hbos have been observed also in several atoll sources ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "much attention among theoreticians is however attracted to the kilohertz qpos ( @xmath1hz ) because their high frequencies are comparable to orbital timescale in the vicinity of a ns .",
    "it is believed that this coincidence represents a strong indication that the corresponding signal originates in the innermost parts of the accretion discs or close to the surface of the ns itself .",

    "the behaviour of the relations shown in the left panel of figure  [ figure:3 ] is determined by this interplay .",

    ", it may be interesting that its frequency value almost coincides with the measured spin frequency of 580hz .",
    "as well as the sly4 eos , we have investigated a wide set of 17 other eos that are based on different theoretical models .",
    "all these eos are listed in table  [ table:1 ] where we show the maximum ns mass allowed by each eos as well as the corresponding ns radius and the central number density .",
    "all these eos are compatible with the highest observed ns masses ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for various tests of eos and their applications , and @xcite and @xcite for the highest observed ns masses ) .    in figure  [ figure:5 ]",
    "we show several relations between the mass and spin frequency obtained for the rp model and our large set of eos .",
    "these relations are similar to those implied by the sly4 eos discussed above .",
    "however , we can see that , in several cases , a given eos does not provide any match for the ns spin of @xmath44hz .",
    "this can rule out the combination of the considered rp model and given specific eos .",

    "we can therefore conclude that , for the ns spin frequency in 4u  1636 - 53 to be close to 580hz , we can exclude 51 from the 90 considered combinations of eos and qpo models .",

    "strong restrictions to the model and implied ns mass may be obtained when low frequency qpos are considered .",
    "this can be clearly illustrated for the rp model which associates the observed low - frequency qpos to the lense  thirring precession that occurs at the same radii as the periastron precession . within the framework of the model , the lense ",
    "thirring frequency @xmath58 represents a sensitive spin indicator @xcite . in our previous paper @xcite we carried out a simplified estimate of the underlying ns angular momentum and mass assuming kerr spacetimes , arriving at the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these values appeared too high when confronted with the implications of the set of 5 eos assumed within the paper .",
    "as discussed here in section  [ section : fits : kerr ] , the extended set of eos can be more compatible with the expectations based on the consideration of lense  thirring precession .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our previous estimate to hartle - thorne spacetime and all 18 eos .",
    "results of such extension are included in figure  [ figure:9 ] .",
    "we show there 13 eos compatible with the observed twin peak qpos and rp model , and demonstrate that 8 of these eos do not meet requirements based on the consideration of lense - thirring preccession .",
    "only 5 eos are thus compatible with the model .",

    "<S> twin - peak quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed in the x - ray power - density spectra of several accreting low - mass neutron star ( ns ) binaries . in our previous work </S>",
    "<S> we have considered several qpo models . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified and explored mass  angular - momentum relations implied by individual qpo models for the atoll source 4u  1636 - 53 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend our study and confront qpo models with various ns equations of state ( eos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we start with simplified calculations assuming kerr background geometry and then present results of detailed calculations considering the influence of ns quadrupole moment ( related to rotationally induced ns oblateness ) assuming hartle - thorne spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the application of concrete eos together with a particular qpo model yields a specific mass  angular - momentum relation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that the degeneracy in mass and angular momentum can be removed when the ns spin frequency inferred from the x - ray burst observations is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we inspect a large set of eos and discuss their compatibility with the considered qpo models . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that when the ns spin frequency in 4u  1636 - 53 is close to 580hz we can exclude 51 from 90 of the considered combinations of eos and qpo models . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss additional restrictions that may exclude even more combinations . </S>",
    "<S> namely , there are 13 eos compatible with the observed twin peak qpos and the relativistic precession model . however , when considering the low frequency qpos and lense - thirring precession , only 5 eos are compatible with the model . </S>"
