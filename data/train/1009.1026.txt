    "recent observations of heavy elements ( metals ) in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) give rich information about star formation and enrichment history of the universe @xcite . in order to understand these observations , it is necessary to know which processes are responsible for the observed ionic composition and thermal state of the igm . in the absence of ionizing background radiation ,",
    "these processes are controlled by collisions and determined by gas metallicity and temperature . however ,",
    "when galaxies and quasars form they produce strong ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "therefore photoionization and photoheating are to be taken into account .",
    "calculations of the cooling rates of astrophysical plasma in the collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) were performed by many authors @xcite .",

    "ionizing radiation can be important for the thermal and ionization states of primordial and enriched gas .",
    "@xcite showed that the presence of uv radiation can strongly suppress the cooling rate of primordial gas . in the photoionization equilibrium case",
    ", @xcite came to a similar conclusion for enriched gas exposed to the external ionizing radiation .",
    "it is obvious that ionizing radiation forces the ionic composition of gas to settle on to photoequilibrium .",
    "however , during transition from a pure collisional to a photoequilibrium case the nonequilibrium effects are expected to play a role .    in general",
    ", numerical simulations of metal ionization states in the igm should take into account the effects of ionizing background .",
    "however , this requires tracing huge number of metal species and their ionization states , as well as complex calculations of the cooling and heating rates of the enriched photoionized gas .",
    "therefore , simulations often consider either a limited number of metal ionization states or cooling rates of collisionally ionized gas .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied a radiative bow shock using a limited ionization and cooling network ;",
    "@xcite used the cie cooling rates to study the ionic composition of a warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "@xcite presented a comprehensive nonequilibrium ionization analysis of the supernova remnant .",
    "recently , self - consistent calculations were successfully performed in one - dimension .",
    "@xcite studied the metals photoionization structures of pressure - supported gas clouds in dark matter minihalos and lately @xcite considered the ionic composition of gas in post - shock cooling layers behind fast radiative shock waves .",
    "more recently , three - dimensional nonequilibrium modelling of the interstellar meduim were performed by @xcite .",
    "they considered the evolution of the turbulent magnetized interstellar meduim taking into account the time - dependent ionization of ten main chemical elements . here , we study how nonequilibrium affects the ionic composition and cooling rates of an enriched photoionized gas and analyze a parameter space ( i.e. , temperature , density , metallicity , and ionizing radiation flux ) where the nonequilibrium effects should be taken into account .    in the last decade studies of",
    "the intergalactic gas became very intensive . among the most interesting are the conclusions about the total mass of baryons in the universe and its metal fraction .",
    "@xcite have estimated the cosmic baryon budget and found that less than 10% of the total baryonic content in the universe is locked in the form of collapsed objects ( stars , galaxies , groups ) .",
    "more recently @xcite founded that approximately @xmath6% of the baryons remain unaccounted for .",
    "a significant discrepancy is also established for the total mass of metals observed in the universe and the metal budget estimated from the total star formation rate .",
    "this lack of metals is known as the missing metals problem @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations led by @xcite suggest that approximately 30 to 50% of the cosmic baryons at @xmath7 are in the form of a diffuse intergalactic medium with temperature of @xmath8  k@xmath9  k , which has been called a warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whigm ) .",
    "subsequent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recent observational data interpretation @xcite also generally support this picture .",
    "however , a significant part of the baryons is still unaccounted for @xcite .",
    "thus , the question of missing baryons / metals physical condition is still open @xcite .",
    "many current and future uv / x - ray missions ( hst , chandra , xmm - newton , galex , fuse , world space observatory  wso : spectrum - uv , spectrum - x - gamma , as well as xeus ) aim to find solution of it . in many numerical efforts for solving this question the equilibrium cooling rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used .",
    "obviously , feedback from galactic winds , supernova explosions and ionizing radiation from galaxies and quasars move the whigm away from the equilibrium . in this",

    "a gas parcel is assumed to be optically thin for external ionizing radiation . in our calculations",
    "we consider all ionization states of the elements h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si and fe . we take into account the following major processes : photoionization , multi - electron auger ionization process , collisional ionization , radiative and dielectronic recombination as well as charge transfer in collisions with hydrogen and helium atoms and ions .",

    "such a property can be clearly seen for the cumulatuve extragalactic background for @xmath45  kev at redshifts 0 and 3 , where the contribution from quasars is dominant .",

    "for such a spectrum shape , the photon - number weighted average intensity above 13.6  ev is close to that for the blackbody spectrum with an effective temperature @xmath48  k @xcite",
    ". certainly , to model an adequate stellar cluster spectrum the theoretical starburst calculations are necessary .",
    "however , such models depend on many parameters , e.g. , initial mass function , star formation efficiency , etc .",

    "moreover , which of two processes , collisions or photoionization , is dominant can be also identified using ionic ratios . for gas with a given density and metallicity exposed to an ionizing radiation the transition between collisionally controlled or photoionization regimes depends on the photoionization rate , which is determined by spectrum shape and flux magnitude .",

    "the significant deviation from photoequilibrium can be also found for the hm01 background . in the panel ( a )",
    "one can see that the decrease of the uv flux amplitude leads to that the civ fraction ratio tends to that in collisionally controlled gas .",
    "we should note once again that due to the recombination lag the carbon ionic states in the nonequilibrium are always overionized in comparison with these in the equilibrium ( see the panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) : where the ratio is below 1 , the cv state dominates in the nonequilibrium , e.g. the cv is overionized , and in the opposite case , where the ratio is greater than 1 , the civ is overionized , whereas in the photoequilibrium under the same conditions the ciii fraction increases fastly .",
    "this is clearly seen in the right panels of figure  [ figrelri ] , where the ratio of the values , @xmath56 , in the nonequilibrium to that in the equilibrium is presented .",
    "indeed , in the panel ( b ) the shaded region in the bottom left conner corresponds to the ratio less than 0.1 , i.e. the denominator of the ratio , the @xmath57 value in the equlibrium , is high .    in the panel ( d )",
    "the strong deviations of the @xmath57 value from the photoequilibrium can be found for the hm01 spectrum .",
    "because the ciii / civ ratio is used as one of the important observable indicator to discriminate between the heii reionizaton models @xcite , we should pay attention on the significant difference at redshifts @xmath58 , when the heii reionization is expected to occur .",
    "the nonequilibrium analysis of the ciii / civ ratio in the absorption spectra obtained by @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "certainly , for lower metallicity smaller deviations are expected .",
    "however , one can conclude that the nonequilibrium effects are significant and it should be taken into account in the simulations of the igm state .       versus @xmath59 in the photo - nonequilibrium model for cooling gas with @xmath52  @xmath53 and @xmath60 exposed to the ionizing radiation with @xmath54 and two fluxes @xmath61 and 0.1 (",

    "the `` cooling tracks '' are the gray diagrams , where the gray gradation corresponds to gas temperature .",
    "as can be expected , the strong difference between the photoequilibrium and time - dependent tracks is seen for @xmath61 , whereas the tracks for @xmath62 become closer . indeed",

    "@xcite showed that the column density ratios in the high velocity clouds observed by @xcite can be fitted using the nonequilibrium collisional model . here",
    "we confirm that the nonequilibrium photoionization models can also explain the observed ratios , for a gas with @xmath71  @xmath53 exposed to @xmath72 and @xmath54 in particular .",
    "for example , the ionization states of carbon and oxygen for @xmath61 can be found in figure  [ figcoolantspl ] .",

    "the spectral index @xmath18 is taken equal to 1 , 1.7 and 5 , and for the extragalactic background spectra the redshift varies from 0 to 6 .",
    "in all calculations , we assume that the gas is optically thin .",
    "we have found the following .    *",
    "the time - dependent cooling rates depend significantly on the gas metallicity and density as well as on the flux and shape of the ionizing radiation .",
    "* the time - dependent cooling rates and ionic composition of gas differ strongly from those in the photoequilibrium due to the overionization of ionic states in the time - dependent case .",
    "the time - dependent cooling efficiency is generally lower than that in the photoequilibrium , and the nonequilibrium effects can be clearly seen at @xmath0  k for the solar metallicity .",
    "* the difference between the time - dependent and equilibrium rates can be significant , its magnitude is maximal at ionization parameter as low as log@xmath75 , and similar to the difference between the equlibrium and the nonequilibrium cooling rates in the collisionally controlled gas ( see figures  [ figrelpl][figrelhm ] ) .",
    "* contributions by individual chemical elements to the total cooling rate can be significantly different for time - dependent and equilibrium plasma at @xmath0  k. * the mismatch of both ionic states and their ratios in the photoequilibrium and photo - nonequilibrium can reach a factor of several .",
    "in this paper we have considered the external radiation and gas parameters , under which the cooling rates and ionic composition in the photoequilibrium and photo - nonequilibrium are expected to be close to each other , and a change of the parameters which violates this equality .",
    "the parameter space where the nonequilibrium effects are significant is quite wide .",
    "because the difference between the photoequlibrium and the nonequilibrium is maximal for the ionization parameter log  @xmath1 , then the nonequilibrium collisional cooling rates and ionization states are a better choice for such a low ionization parameter .",
    "we have found that the difference decreases with the ionization parameter growth , and the photoequilibrium is reached for ionization parameter as high as log  @xmath2 for @xmath3 and log  @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . for supersolar metallicity",
    "the photoequilibrium is expected to reach for higher ionization parameter .",
    "we have concluded that the nonequilibrium photoionization calculations should be conducted , when the contribution from collisions to the total ionization rate is significant .",
    "the main reason of the deviation in the time - dependent case is the recombination lag , so the ionic states are expected to be overionized , especially this is notable for metals",
    ". therefore we should pay attention on the importance of use nonequilibrium cooling rates for near - solar ( and above ) metallicity of gas exposed to arbitrary ionizing radiation flux .",
    "thus , the nonequilibrium cooling rates are the necessary component for study metals in the igm , mixing metal processes , damped lyman-@xmath18 systems , galactic superwinds and so on . also to simulate correctly the whigm ionic composition we need nonequilibrium processes and more exact models for ionizing background flux .",
