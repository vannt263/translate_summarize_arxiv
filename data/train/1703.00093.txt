    "in this paper , we consider the following interface problems @xmath0 in one and two dimensions .",
    "we assume that there is a closed interface @xmath1 in the solution domain across which the coefficient @xmath2 has a finite jump ( discontinuity ) @xmath3 because of the discontinuity , the natural jump condition should be satisfied , that is , both of the solution and the flux should be continuous across the interface @xmath1 @xmath4_{\\gamma}=0 , \\qquad \\left[\\beta \\frac{\\partial",
    "u}{\\partial n } \\right]_{\\gamma } = 0,\\ ] ] where the jump at a point @xmath5 on the interface @xmath1 is defined as    @xmath6_{\\mathbf{x } }    = \\lim_{\\mathbf{x } \\rightarrow\\mathbf{x } , \\mathbf{x } \\in \\omega_2 } \\beta(\\mathbf{x } ) \\frac{\\partial u(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial n }   - \\lim_{\\mathbf{x}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{x } , \\mathbf{x}\\in \\omega_1 } \\beta(\\mathbf{x } ) \\frac{\\partial u(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial n},\\ ] ]    and @xmath7 is the normal derivative of solution @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the unit normal direction pointing to @xmath10 side , see fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ch2 ] for an illustration .",
    "since a finite element discretization is used , we assume that @xmath11 , @xmath12 excluding @xmath1 . for the regularity requirement of the problem",
    ", we also assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 . from these assumptions ,",
    "we know that the solution @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    , @xmath10 , an interface @xmath1 , and the boundary @xmath18 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    there are many applications of such an interface problem , see for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "many numerical methods have been developed for solving such an important problem .",
    "for the elliptic interface problem ( [ nabla - pde ch2])-([flux ch2 ] ) , the solution has a low global regularity .",
    "thus , a direct conforming finite element method based on polynomial basis functions over a mesh likely works poorly if the mesh is not aligned along the interface since the fe solution will be a smooth piece in an element and can not capture the discontinuity in the directive at the interface .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to assume that the solution is piecewise smooth excluding the interface .",
    "for example , if the coefficient is a piecewise constant in each sub - domain , then the solution in each sub - domain is an analytic function in the interior , but has jump in the normal derivative of the solution across the interface from the pde limiting theory @xcite .",
    "the gradient used in this paper is defined as the _ limiting gradient _ from each side of the interface .",
    "naturally , finite element methods can be and have been applied to solve interface problems .",
    "it is well known that a second order accurate approximation to the solution of an interface problem can be generated by the galerkin finite element method with the standard linear basis functions if the triangulation is aligned with the interface , that is , a body fitted mesh is used , see for example , @xcite .",
    "other state of art methods include the iga - fem , or dpg , a discontinuous petrov - galerkin finite element method @xcite .",
    "some kind of posterior techniques or at least quadratic elements are needed in order to get second order accurate gradient from each side of the interface .",
    "the cost in the mesh generation coupled with unstructured linear solver makes the body - fitted mesh approach less competitive .",
    "alternatively , we can use a structured mesh ( non - body fitted ) to solve such an interface problem .",
    "there are also quite a few finite element methods using cartesian meshes .",
    "the immersed finite element method ( ifem ) was developed for 1d and 2d interface problems in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . since then",
    ", many ifem methods and analysis have appeared in the literature , see for example , @xcite , with applications in @xcite .",
    "often they provide second order accurate solution in @xmath19 norm but only first order accurate flux .",
    "nevertheless , in many applications the primary interest is focused on flux values at interfaces in addition to solutions of governing differential equations , see for example , @xcite .",
    "most of numerical methods for interface problems based on structure meshes are between first and second order accurate for the solution but the accuracy for the gradient is usually one order lower .",
    "note that the gradient recovering techniques for examples , @xcite , hardly work for structured meshes because of the arbitraries of the interface and the underlying mesh",
    ". the mixed finite element approach and a few other methods that can find accurate solutions and gradients simultaneously in the entire domain are often lead to saddle problems and are computationally expensive which are not ideal choices if we are only interested in an accurate gradient near an interface or a boundary . in this paper , we develop two new finite element methods , one is in 1d , the other one is 2d , for obtaining accurate approximations of the flux values at interfaces .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explain the one dimensional algorithm and provide the theoretical analysis .",
    "we explain how to construct approximations to the flux values at the left and the right of the interface , and approximations to the flux values at the boundary of the domain .",
    "the numerical algorithm for two dimensional problems is explained in section 3 along with some numerical experiments .",
    "we conclude and acknowledge in section 4 .",
    "the one dimensional model problem has the following form , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath2 is a piecewise constant and have a finite jump at an interface @xmath22 , and homogenous boundary condition for simplicity of the discussion . across the interface ,",
    "the natural jump conditions are : @xmath23_{\\alpha } = 0 ,   \\qquad   \\left[\\beta   u^{'}(x)\\right]_{\\alpha}=0.\\ ] ]    we define the standard bilinear form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sobolev space @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 the solution of the differential equation @xmath27 is also the solution of the following variational problem : @xmath28    integration by parts over the separated intervals @xmath29 and @xmath30 yields , @xmath31 the superscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicate the limiting value as @xmath34 approaches @xmath35 from the left and right , respectively , and @xmath36 .",
    "recall that @xmath37 for any @xmath38 in @xmath39 , it follows that the differential equation holds in each interval and that @xmath40=u^{+}-u^{-}=0,\\quad\\left[\\beta u_{x}\\right]=\\beta^{+}u^{+}_{x}-\\beta^{-}u^{-}_{x}=0,\\ ] ] where we have dropped the subscript @xmath35 in the jumps for simplicity .",
    "these relations are the same as in @xmath41 , which indicates that the discontinuity in the coefficient @xmath42 does not cause any additional difficulty for the theoretical analysis of the finite element method .",
    "the weak solution will satisfy the jump conditions ( [ jumpcond ch2 ] ) .",
    "now we briefly explain the immersed finite element method ( ifem ) in 1d introduced in @xcite . as in the ifem , we use a uniform grid , i.e. , @xmath43 and assume that @xmath44 . since it is one dimensional problem , we use @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 and so on .",
    "if the interface does not cut an interval @xmath49 , then we use the standard piecewise linear basis function , _",
    "i.e. _ , the hat function @xmath50 , @xmath51 if @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "the associated piecewise linear basis functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 are modified .",
    "for example , @xmath56 is defined as a piecewise linear function that satisfies @xmath58=0,\\quad\\left[\\beta \\varphi^{'}_{j}\\right]=0.\\ ] ] it has been derived in @xcite that @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61    let @xmath62 span @xmath63 be the immersed finite element space for approximating @xmath64 .",
    "we propose the following bilinear form for problem @xmath41 : find @xmath65 such that @xmath66      some error analysis of 1d ifem has been given in @xcite . here",
    "we provide somewhat different and more traditional analysis . as usual , we study the approximation property of the ife space @xmath67 so that we can bound the error of the finite element solution using that of the interpolation function .    assuming that @xmath68 , we define the interpolation operator @xmath69 as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 it is easy to verify that @xmath72 , @xmath73=0 $ ] , and @xmath74=0 $ ] .",
    "now we pay attention to the estimation of @xmath75 . here",
    ", we define @xmath76 , i\\neq j$ ] and @xmath77 $ ] . for a regular element",
    ", we use the classical finite element method to estimate the error .",
    "@xmath78 we are going to focus on the error analysis for the element which contains the interface .",
    "we first define    @xmath79    equipped with the norm and the semi - norm , @xmath80 and @xmath81 then we have the following error estimate for the derivative approximation , @xmath82  from left .    if @xmath83 is the solution of @xmath41 , the following inequality holds : @xmath84      the lemma gives rough estimates of the first order derivative of the interpolation function from each side of the interface with an @xmath89 convergence order compared with that @xmath90 in the @xmath91 of the interpolation function .",
    "later on , we will explain our method to get second order accurate derivative from each side of the interface .",
    "in a similar way , we can prove that @xmath92      although some error analysis is given in @xcite , below we provide some different , more traditional finite element analysis with some results that are useful for accurate gradient computations at the interface .",
    "first we prove the following theorem on the accuracy of the interpolating function  @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath83 is the solution of @xmath41 , and @xmath94 is the interpolation function defined in @xmath95 , then @xmath96 where @xmath87 is a positive constant depending on the interface location , the coefficients @xmath2 , and @xmath88 .      if @xmath102 , the proof is similar .",
    "thus we also have , @xmath103      combining all above to get , @xmath107 which completes the proof .",
    "the following theorem states that the ifem in 1d provides optimal convergence as that the fem for regular problems .",
    "if @xmath83 is the solution of @xmath41 , and @xmath94 is the interpolating function defined in @xmath95 , then @xmath108    we would using @xmath109 and @xmath110 to get @xmath111 this completes the proof of the theorem .      in this sub - section , we explain how to get an accurate flux or first order derivative of the solution at the interface from the left side of the interface .",
    "the method is based on the approach proposed in @xcite for flux computations at boundaries .",
    "the method is based on the use of the galerkin solution of the problem and it is different from other posterior error analysis .",
    "we define the following @xmath112 @xmath113 as an approximation to the exact flux @xmath114 .",
    "below we show that this is a second order approximation which improves the accuracy of the flux by one order compared the estimate in ( [ error ch2 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath83 is the solution of @xmath41 , @xmath115 is the galerkin approximation of the solution of @xmath83 , @xmath112 is as defined above , then @xmath116    we define @xmath117 as a function that satisfied @xmath118 and @xmath119  subtracting ( [ f ch2 ] ) with @xmath120  from ( [ g ch2 ] ) , we have @xmath121 from ( [ c ch2 ] ) and ( [ g ch2 ] ) we can see that @xmath122 set @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , we get the following equation @xmath125 and thus we have @xmath126    next we construct the following auxiliary problem .",
    "let @xmath127 be the solution of the following @xmath128 we also assume that @xmath129 then , for an appropriately chosen @xmath130 , we proceed to get the following , @xmath131 the above yields , @xmath132 for @xmath133 sufficiently small ( [ h ch2 ] ) and ( [ i ch2 ] ) imply that @xmath134 where @xmath87 is a positive constant depending only on the coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath88 .",
    "we now derive an estimate of @xmath135 , using the new auxiliary problem @xmath136 let @xmath137 , then we can get @xmath138 furthermore , using @xmath139 we have @xmath140 finally , we get @xmath141 this completes the proof of the theorem .      in the similar way",

    "@xmath144      the approach for accurate flux computations at the interface can be applied to the flux computation from the left and right boundaries as expressed below .",
    "we define approximations @xmath145 and @xmath146 to the fluxes , @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively : @xmath149 @xmath150 then @xmath145 and @xmath146 are second order approximations to the flux from the left and right boundaries as stated in the following theorem .",
    "we skip the proof since it is similar to that for the flux from the left side of the interface .",
