    "the flow of a quantum fluid past an obstacle can generate various excitations . in the classical example of liquid heii",
    "these are phonons and rotons introduced by landau @xcite in his theory of superfluidity . according to landau",
    ", superfluidity is lost when the flow velocity past an obstacle or through a capillary tube exceeds the threshold of creation of cherenkov - like radiation of linear waves ( or , in other words , of quantum quasi - particles ) . in actual experiments where heii flows through a narrow channel ,",
    "superfluidity is lost at velocities much lower than what is predicted by the landau criterium ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment was explained by feynman @xcite as resulting from the nucleation of _ nonlinear _ excitations : vortex rings generated by the flow past the obstacle .",
    "the same phenomenology is observed in the flow of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , either for trapped ultracold atomic vapors or polaritons in semiconductor microcavities , with special features linked to the specific dispersion relation of elementary excitations in these systems : for instance the landau critical velocity is the velocity of sound @xmath0 , and in two dimensions ( 2d ) the cherenkov radiation forms an interference pattern located outside of the mach cone @xcite .",
    "these specificities being taken into account , one observes phenomena similar to those observed in liquid helium : in 2d or 3d flows past obstacles , superfluidity is broken at velocity lower than @xmath0 @xcite because of the nucleation of vortices @xcite or generation of effectively stable oblique solitons @xcite ( recently observed in experiments with polariton condensates @xcite ) , and more complicated dispersive shock waves ( dsw ) patterns @xcite .     as indicated by the arrow .",
    "the density in the region @xmath1 is a portion of a dark soliton ( see sec .",
    "[ cetd ] ) with asymptotic upstream density ( @xmath2 ) and subsonic velocity .",
    "the flow in the downstream region @xmath3 has a constant density and a supersonic velocity . ]",
    "the situation in quasi-1d flows is similar : although generation of vortices or oblique solitons is impossible in this case , dark solitons are still easily generated stable nonlinear excitations @xcite .",
    "together with dsw , these nonlinear excitations are , as is already the case in higher dimension , keys ingredients for understanding the time - dependent dynamics of guided becs in presence of obstacles , as experimentally studied in refs .  @xcite . besides their interest for studying nonlinear quantum transport , quasi-1d bec flows",
    "have also been suggested as model systems for creating sonic horizons suitable for the experimental observation of acoustic analogues of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "in particular , an interesting type of stationary sonic horizon has been identified in refs .",
    "it corresponds to the situation where an upstream subsonic region is separated from a downstream supersonic one by an obstacle of the form of a delta potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] and discussion below ) .",
    "the present work is devoted to the study of the dynamics of the formation of this configuration .",
    "we show that it can be obtained by launching a bec wave packet onto a localized obstacle ( not necessarily a delta peak @xcite ) . when the wave packet reaches the potential , the density typically piles up in front of the obstacle , forming a plateau accompanied by a dsw which is ejected upstream .",
    "we study the characteristic features of this dsw in detail ( both analytically and numerically ) and determine for which parameters ( specific to the flow and to the obstacle ) the situation just described can be realized .",
    "theoretical analysis of 1d flows past an obstacle has already been addressed in a number of papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in these papers ,",
    "it was found that there exist two critical velocities @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the sub - critical flows whose velocity @xmath7 is below @xmath4 are superfluid and generate no excitations in vicinity of the obstacle ; the super - critical ones with velocity above @xmath8 do not generate nonlinear dsw but the cherenkov radiation is effective and there is no sonic horizon ; at last , in the trans - critical region , for flows whose velocity @xmath7 lies between the two critical values , @xmath9 , dsw are generated , generally speaking at both sides of the obstacle , and only in a very narrow range of velocities both dsw are detached from the obstacle .",
    "hence , it seems difficult to reach a situation such as the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .",
    "note however that the above quoted references @xcite mainly considered flows with identical asymptotic parameters at both sides far enough from the obstacle .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions is natural when the obstacle is put into motion starting from a situation where it is immobile in a condensate at rest .",
    "however , another setup is possible , which is of considerable practical interest , being similar to the flow of a fluid through a laval nozzle @xcite . in this configuration ( already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the parameters of the flow are kept fixed only on the side of the incoming flow and the downstream flow expands freely into vacuum . in this case",
    "a dsw can be created only upstream and the parameters of the shock can be calculated analytically for two typical models of obstacle potential : ( i ) a smooth potential with typical size greater than the characteristic healing length @xmath10 and ( ii ) a short - range potential acting at distances much less than @xmath10 . in the first case",
    "the dispersion effects can be neglected at the location of the obstacle ( in the so called hydraulic approximation ) and the theory reduces to the scheme presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the second case",
    "the potential can be approximated by a @xmath11 function and its action amounts to the matching condition of exact solutions at the point of its location .",
    "this last case has not been considered so far in this kind of problem and we shall discuss it here in detail .",
    "we will show that it makes it possible to realize asymptotically ( i.e. , at large time ) a sonic horizon such as represented in fig .",

    "hence , in the case where the dsw is attached to the obstacle the solution of region @xmath32 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) completely disappears and the formulae derived above loose their meaning .",

    "if @xmath225 we get @xmath226 the dsws can be attached to the trans - critical flow as accounted for in detail in @xcite . in our initial value problem , with a wave packet incoming from the left infinity , there can be no downstream dsw",

    "our analytical theory is based on the assumption that the stationary flow with a plateau in region @xmath32 is formed instantaneously after collision of the condensate with the obstacle .",
    "this assumption justifies the application of the self - similar solution [ characterized by formulae ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) and",

    "the obstacle is modeled by a gaussian potential @xmath237 with @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( i.e. , the size of the obstacle is less than the healing length ) .",
    "the results of the numerical evolution of the flow after a time @xmath240 are shown in fig .",

    "the potential ( [ 15 - 1 ] ) deviates significantly from a @xmath11 potential : we have here @xmath239 which is too large for using the natural prescription for defining , starting from ( [ 15 - 1 ] ) , an equivalent @xmath11 potential of the form ( [ 3 - 7 ] ) by @xmath241 .",
    "this prescription would be accurate only in the limit @xmath242 .",
    "the value @xmath133 used in the analytical procedure results from a fit of the numerically obtained density of the plateau ( @xmath243 ) ; then all the other parameters of the flow are determined by the analytical formulae . that this procedure is legitimate is confirmed by the very good description of the upstream velocity @xmath122 in region @xmath32 and of the density @xmath40 and velocity @xmath165 in the supersonic downstream region @xmath34 : one obtains analytically @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 , whereas one finds numerically @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath246 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig4bis ] ) .",
    "we checked that the natural prescription @xmath249 yields a very good agreement of the analytical and of the numerical approaches for low values of @xmath250 .",

    "perfect agreement with the numerical values of @xmath2 , @xmath40 , @xmath122 and @xmath165 is found by using an effective @xmath255 , close to the natural prescription .",
    "however , for reducing the numerical effort we performed extensive simulations only in the case @xmath239 .",
    "the efficiency of the effective @xmath11 barrier for representing a potential of the form ( [ 15 - 1 ] ) even though @xmath250 is not very small is a positive test of the robustness of our analytical description of the system .",
    "we note that the theory predicts the conservation of the riemann invariant @xmath256 across the dsw ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and that this is fulfilled with very good accuracy in the numerical simulations .",
    "the positions @xmath107 of the edges of the dsw are also in good agreement with the theoretical prediction . because of the scale used on the @xmath35-axis of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one could think that the density is discontinuous around @xmath103 .",
    "this is not the case , and furthermore one can verify that in this region the analytical and numerical density profiles are very similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4bis ] ( right plot ) . also inside the dsw ,",
    "the nonlinear oscillations are very well described by the analytical approach ( same figure , left plot ) .    .",
    "the three upper panels present the results of numerical simulations performed in the case where the obstacle is represented by the gaussian potential ( [ 15 - 1 ] ) and the incident beam by ( [ 15 - 2 ] ) with @xmath235 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "the lower panel is the analytical result corresponding to a point - like obstacle ( [ 3 - 7 ] ) and a step - like incident beam ( [ 3 - 51]),([3 - 52 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath259 . ]    .",
    "these plots are enlargements of specific parts of the two lower plots of fig .",
    "the left plot concerns a part of the dsw ( @xmath260 ) , and the right one concentrates on the region of the obstacle . in both the right and left plots",
    "the black solid line corresponds to the analytical density profile . in the right plot",
    "the red solid line is the numerical density computed in the case @xmath261 .",
    "the numerical profile is represented by red points in the left plot , because it would be indistinguishable from the analytical result if represented with a solid line . ]",
    "hence , we can legitimately state that the hypothesis of rapid formation of the dsw which , as already explained , is at the heart of our assumption of self - similarity , is validated by the comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "this makes it possible to bypass the delicate and interesting question of the short time dynamics which is discussed for instance in ref .",
    "however , our numerical simulations reveal a peculiar feature of the flow , namely , a train of dark solitons is observed along the plateau in region @xmath32 ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] , upper panels ) .",
    "as it is clear from the figure , the number of solitons in the plateau decreases with @xmath234 and the appearance of a train of solitons is thus an effect of the finite width of the front of the initial wave packet .",
    "these solitons are generated at the initial stage of evolution and their precise characteristics depend on the details of the initial density distribution .",
    "we note that the number of solitons in the train is several orders of magnitude lower than the number of nonlinear oscillations in the dsw ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , i.e. , the existence of this train of solitons is a minor effect in our asymptotic description of the flow . nonetheless ,",
    "in any experiment the incident wave packet will not be infinitely sharp and the resulting train of solitons should be easily observed .",
    "it is therefore worth spending some time discussing its properties .",
    "the periodic solution ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) describes a train of solitons if one considers a situation where @xmath262 while the other riemann invariants ( @xmath90 and @xmath77 ) remain constant . here",
    "one has @xmath263 the velocity @xmath264 and minimal density @xmath265 of one of the solitons of the train can be expressed as functions of the coinciding riemann invariants @xmath266 : @xmath267 and @xmath268 where @xmath122 is given by eq .",

    "gets @xmath269 . in accordance with the general spirit of our approach",
    ", we again assume self - similarity of the solution , i.e. , the locations of the solitons are given by an equation of the form @xmath270 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath271 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a ( red online ) dashed line attached to the soliton edge of the dsw @xcite .",
    "note that ( [ 17 - 1 ] ) corresponds to the solution ( [ 6 - 1a ] ) of the whitham equation in the soliton limit where @xmath272 .",
    "then , elimination of @xmath264 from ( [ 16 - 3b ] ) yields the following relation @xmath273 between two easily measurable parameters : the minimal density @xmath274 of a soliton and its coordinate @xmath35 at time @xmath63 .",
    "the very good agreement of this analytical prediction with the numerical results is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where the solid line represents the curve ( [ 16 - 4 ] ) whereas the dots show the minimal density at the position of the solitons as observed in fig .",

    "( [ 16 - 3b ] ) ] .",
    "the dots show the same quantity obtained from the density profile @xmath275 computed numerically in the case @xmath235 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , upper panel ) . ]    hence , although the detailed description of all the features of the soliton train  depending of the precise shape of the incident front of the wave - packet and of the potential  is beyond the scope of our approach , we still can get some insight on the loci of the density minima by assuming a kind of self similarity which relies on the fact confirmed by inspection of the numerical simulations  that the train is formed in a very short period , at the initial stage of the collision between the condensate and the obstacle .",
    "it then evolves according to the solitonic limit of whitham equations .",
    "in the present work we studied the flow of a bose - einstein beam incident onto an obstacle in a regime where a structure forms similar to the supersonic expansion obtained in a laval nozzle . for an appropriate choice of incident flow and of potential modeling the obstacle we showed that , at large time , an acoustic horizon is created around the obstacle .",
    "its formation is accompanied by a release of energy in the form of a dispersive shock wave whose characteristics were studied in detail .",
    "this made it possible to precisely determine the condition of formation of the structure studied in the present work ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the analytical description has been sustained by numerical simulations which confirmed our analysis .",
    "the numerics however revealed an interesting and unexpected feature : the ejection of the dsw from the region of the horizon is typically accompanied by a train of dark solitons which are only slowly expelled from the obstacle .",
    "we argued that this train of solitons is formed in the initial stage of collision of the bose - einstein beam with the obstacle and that its detailed characteristics depend on the precise shape of the incident beam and of the obstacle potential .",
    "we also showed that one of its important features can be described analytically ( namely the line of location of the density minima ) , precisely because this train is formed in an early stage .",
    "the existence of this history - dependent train of solitons is due to the specific dispersive and nonlinear wave mechanics describing the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it remains to investigate whether this train of solitons does or does not hinders the experimental observation of sonic analog of hawking radiation .",
