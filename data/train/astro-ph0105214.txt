    "there have been many detections of ultraviolet resonance line absorption by highly ionized , presumably hot , gas in the galactic halo ( e.g. , sembach & savage 1992 , hurwitz & bowyer 1996 ) , but only three claimed detections of ultraviolet resonance line emission from this gas .",
    "first , martin & bowyer ( 1990 ) reported detections of the ( unresolved ) ( @xmath0 1548/1550  ) emission in 4 out of their 8 lines of sight with a maximum strength of @xmath4 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 .",
    "they also detectected o iii ] ( @xmath5 1663  ) emission at about half the intensity and much lower significance .",
    "second , out of the ten hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) targets which could be profitably used for studies of the galactic halo , @xcite detected emission in four directions at levels on the order of @xmath6 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  ( @xmath7 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) , with 2 @xmath8 upper limits of roughly the same level on the other six targets .",
    "finally , there have been three recent observations of emission using the _ fuse _ satellite all at a level of about only 5000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 : @xcite at ( l , b ) = ( 315.00 , -41.33 ) ; and @xcite at ( l , b ) = ( 284.2 , 74.5 ) and ( l , b ) = ( 57.6 , 88.0 ) .    the most constraining upper limit is the _ minisat-01 _",
    "90% confidence upper limit of @xmath9 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  ( 1200 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) from @xcite with earlier limits of about @xmath10 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  ( 7600 photons @xmath1",
    "sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that all values cited for the emission are for the integrated emission over both lines of the doublet .",
    "@xcite have reprocessed 17 years ( 1977  1994 ) of data from the _ voyager _ 1 and  2 archives with a focus on the continuum emission due to dust scattering . in the present paper",
    ", we will discuss limits , from the same data set , on ( 1032/1038   ) line emission from the ism .",
    "although new instruments are now providing important results , the _ voyager _ data are still the only source of information on the emission over many different lines of sight .",
    "the two _ voyager _ spacecraft were launched in 1977 and have taken fuv ( 500 - 1700  ) spectra of astronomical objects ever since .",
    "each spacecraft includes a wadsworth - mounted objective grating spectrometer ( uvs ) with a field of view of 01 x 087 and a spectral resolution of 38    for aperture filling diffuse sources .",
    "a full description of the uvs instruments and the _ voyager _ mission is given by @xcite .",
    "the data processing is described in @xcite . because we were only interested in the diffuse background , all other observations ( planets , stars and nebulae ) were discarded .",
    "the remaining data consist of 426 observations of diffuse background .",
    "the doublet ( @xmath0 1032/1038   ) is clearly visible in the _ voyager _ spectra of bright sources such as supernovae remnants @xcite and the eridanus superbubble @xcite , where the doublet is much brighter than the heliospheric hydrogen ly  @xmath11(@xmath12 1026   ) emission .",
    "however , the emission from the diffuse halo gas is much less than the ly  @xmath11  emission on whose wings it lies .",
    "fortunately , because the lyman lines are optically thick , the ly  @xmath11/ly  @xmath13  ratio is constant throughout the heliosphere and we can use the ly  @xmath13line to scale the ly  @xmath11  line .",
    "we determined the ratio between the two lines using uvs observations in which only the heliospheric lines were present and then used this empirical ratio to scale the ly  @xmath11  line in each observation ( see @xcite for a full description of this procedure ) .",
    "we subtracted this scaled ly  @xmath11  intensity from the observed spectrum and determined the upper limit from the remainder .    because the ly  @xmath11  line is at almost the same position as the line , there is a tradeoff between their respective derived intensities .",
    "note , however , that the difference in the central wavelengths of the ly  @xmath11  and emission is large enough ( 1 resolution element ) that can not fully , or even largely , replace the ly  @xmath11  contribution . in our procedure , we have restricted the heliospheric ly  @xmath11/ly  @xmath13  ratio to fall between empirically determined limits ; if , on the other hand , we allow the ly  @xmath11/ly  @xmath13  ratio to vary freely , our limits on the emission will be correspondingly poorer .",
    "we have carried out this exercise for each of our targets but , because of the varying amount of heliospheric emission , can not compare points on an individual basis . in general , our limits",
    "go up ( become less constraining ) by a factor of 2  3 .",
    "thus our best upper limit rises from 2600 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  to 8500 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  and the number of pointings with limits under 50,000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  drops to 127 from 244 .",
    "( details of the individual targets are available from the authors on request . )",
    "@xcite have claimed that @xcite and @xcite , have significantly underestimated the errors in the _ voyager _ data . as the data analysis in this work rests heavily on the earlier papers , particularly that of @xcite , we are compelled to address these criticisms . a careful reading of the edelstein et al .",
    "paper shows that there are virtually no differences between their results and ours , despite their claims . from their table 2 edelstein et al .",
    "obtain a 1  @xmath8 uncertainty of 125 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  @xmath2 , identical to the limit claimed by @xcite .",
    "however , they also obtain a residual of 320 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  @xmath2 whereas @xcite found a null signal .",
    "this difference can be traced to edelstein et al .",
    "estimating two large numbers from a figure in @xcite , subtracting the two and claiming that as the residual .",
    "if they had actually used the original data in digital format , the correct procedure , their results would have agreed exactly with @xcite .",
    "importantly for this work , and contrary to their claims , @xcite have shown that the counting errors in our analysis procedure are reasonable .    because the signal in the _ voyager _ spectra is dominated by the rtg particle background ( due to radioactivity in the radioisotope thermoelectric generator ) and the scattered ly  @xmath13 ,",
    "we have explored the possibility that systematic errors in the subtraction of the two components are affecting our limits . should there be a feature in either of these components coincidentally at the position of",
    ", we would expect the limits to be correlated with that component , because the strength of that feature would be necessarily correlated with the level of the continuum ( the sum of the rtg and ly  @xmath13  contributions ) . over the 17 years of _ voyager _",
    "observations , both the rtg level and the ly  @xmath13  emission declined : the former because of the decline in the radioactivity of the plutonium power source and the latter because of the increasing distance of the spacecraft from the sun .",
    "thus , if there were any significant systematic errors associated with the background subtraction , our limits would be strongly correlated with the year of observation .",
    "no such effect is detectable in our data ( shown in the case of the ly  @xmath13  emission in figure 1 ) , implying that systematic effects due to the subtraction of the rtg and ly  @xmath13  backgrounds are unimportant .",
    "we can demonstrate empirically that our quoted error bars are reasonable through a listing of each of the errors in one of our targets ( table 1 ) .",
    "note that we have arbitrarily chosen the location with our most constraining limit .",
    "we have listed in table 1 the integrated counts under the line in the total spectrum and in each of the modeled components of the raw _ voyager _ data : the rtg spectrum ; the ly  @xmath13  template ; ly  @xmath11  emission ; and the diffuse continuum ( due to dust - scattered starlight ) .",
    "the poisson errors are also listed , with the rtg and total errors reflecting the fact that each rtg event generates 3 counts @xcite . from these errors",
    "we then calculate a total uncertainty , assuming uncorrelated errors . for this target",
    "we obtain a 1 @xmath8 uncertainty of 308 counts corresponding to a signal of 1400 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the 90% confidence level of 2600 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2   that we derived using our modeling procedure ( the modeling is described in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "our quoted uncertainties have taken into account all the statistical errors and come from a @xmath14 minimization according to the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "essentially , we changed the value of the emission , while allowing the other parameters to vary freely through the allowed parameter space , until the @xmath15 emission rose to unacceptable levels .",
    "we detect no emission in any of 426 uvs observations of the diffuse radiation field but do set upper limits on such emission in each direction .",
    "the best of these limits is 2600 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2(@xmath16 ergs @xmath1",
    "sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) in the resonance line doublet in the direction ( l , b ) = ( 117.3 , 50.6 ) .",
    "this direction is quite close to hd 121800 ( l , b = 113.0 , 49.8 , spectral type b1.5  v , distance = 2.2  kpc ) towards which @xcite obtained a column density of @xmath17 @xmath1 using orfeus . using these values and equation 5 of @xcite , and confining the temperature range to that",
    "for which the fraction of oxygen atoms in the state is within 10% of its maximum value in collisional ionization equilibrium plasma ( t = @xmath18 k  @xcite ) , we find an upper limit on the electron density of less than 0.010 @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that the emitting gas has a solar abundance of helium atoms and that the hydrogen and helium are fully ionized , there will be 1.9 particles per electron and thus the thermal pressure will be less than 12,000 k @xmath3 , close to the thermal pressure of 15,000 k @xmath3 in the local bubble derived by @xcite from observations of the 1/4 kev soft x - ray flux seen by rosat .",
    "the 94 locations in which we set 90% confidence upper limits of better than @xmath19 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  ( 25,000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) are plotted in figure 2 and those in which we set limits of better than @xmath20 ergs @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2  ( @xmath21 10,000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "several of our observations are near the locations observed by @xcite using hut and we both set similar upper limits in those ( with our _ voyager _ limits in general being more constraining ) . only in their target 3",
    "( ugc 5675 ; l = 218.2 , b = 56.4 ) do we obtain inconsistent results , with @xcite quoting a flux of 23,000 @xmath22 6000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2while we place a 90% upper limit of 10@xmath23 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2at ( l , b ) = ( 216.8 , 55.3 )  about 1@xmath24 away . of course , it is entirely possible that there are truly spatial variations of this scale in the ism .",
    "we also have several observations near the four high latitude locations where martin & bowyer ( 1990 ) detected emission but in none can we do more than say that the /c  iv ratio is not inconsistent with the theoretical ratios reported from a variety of physical conditions ( e.g. cooling flows : @xcite ; shock heated gas : @xcite ; fountains : @xcite ; halo supernova remnants : @xcite ) .",
    "very recent results concerning galactic diffuse emission include the _ fuse _ detections by @xcite and @xcite at a level of 5000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2and the _",
    "minisat-01 _ all - sky upper limit of 1200 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2by @xcite . combined with the present _",
    "voyager _ upper limits , it appears that much of the sky has an emission of significantly less than 10,000 photons @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 .",
    "only the 4 hut detections of @xcite show higher fluxes . a mission dedicated to the observation and mapping of faint line emission from the galactic halo would surely yield bountiful results .",
