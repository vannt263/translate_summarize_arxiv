    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies that rival quasars in energy output were first identified nearly thirty years ago ( rieke & low 1972 ) , and were shown by _ iras _ fifteen years ago to exist in numbers comparable to those of quasars in the nearby universe ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 ) .",

    "a number of bright infrared and radio sources appear to be the regions of star formation and/or nuclear activity responsible for the large overall luminosity ( see gehrz , sramek , & weedman 1983 ; wynn - williams et al .",

    "these general characteristics are consistent with numerical simulations of collisions between gas - rich galaxies ( see barnes & hernquist 1996 and references therein ) that show how interactions lead to transportation of large quantities of molecular gas into the centers of galaxies .",
    "this concentration of gas leads to a strong burst of star - formation and may activate an agn .",
    "however , these properties make the centers of activity in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies virtually impenetrable in the visible and ultraviolet .",

    "the images were reduced with routines from the package _ nicred _ ( mcleod 1997 ) .",
    "the main steps in the data reduction involve subtraction of the first readout , dark current subtraction on a readout - by - readout basis , correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection ( using fullfit ) , and flatfielding . darks with sample sequences and exposure times corresponding to those of our observations were obtained from other programs close in time to ours .",
    "usually between 10 and 20 darks were averaged together ( after the subtraction of the first readout ) for a given sample sequence . however , in the case of f110 m we got better removal of the artifacts using a dark+sky image generated by median combining all the dithered galaxy images for this filter .",
    "flatfield images were constructed from on - orbit data .",
    "since our images were obtained after august 1997 , no correction for the pedestal effect was necessary . for more specific details on the reduction of the nic3 images",

    "( 1998 ) .",
    "after removal of artifacts , the dithered galaxy images were registered to a common position using fractional pixel offsets and cubic spline interpolation , and combined to produce the final images .",
    "the nic1 f110 m images were mosaiced . since there are no bright common sources in the overlapping regions of the images , we used the world coordinate information contained in the header to compute the offsets .",

    "prior to flux - calibrating the images , we measured the background on blank corners of the images . although this interacting pair of galaxies is known to be extended beyond the field of the nic2 images , the background values measured in the nic2 f222 m filter image are in excellent agreement with the background measurements taken during the servicing mission observatory verification ( smov ) program .",

    "k. luhman obtained optical spectra of ngc  3690 for us with the red channel spectrograph at the multiple mirror telescope on mount hopkins , on november 2729 1997 .",
    "he used the 270 g mm@xmath9 grating ( @xmath46 ) to measure spectra from 4600  to 8600 . a @xmath47 slit with pixel size",
    "0.6 pixel@xmath9 provided a spectral resolution of @xmath48 . to derive the sensitivity function of the array he also observed the standard star bd+8 2015 .",
    "the 2-d spectra were subtracted from bias - subtracted frames , corrected for the sensitivity function and wavelength calibrated using he - ar - ne lamp spectra .",

    "spectra were extracted centered at b2 with position angles pa@xmath49 and pa@xmath50 , and centered near b1 .",
    "centering the slit on b1 with the acquisition camera proved difficult because this nucleus is barely seen in the optical .",
    "therefore , the coordinates obtained from the nicmos images were used , and the slit was kept at the same position angles as for b2 . finally the slit was centered at c with position angle pa@xmath36 .",
    "the position angles of the slits were chosen because pa@xmath50 includes b1 and b2 , and pa@xmath49 includes the hii regions located northwest of b1 .",
    "the spectrum centered at b1 probably contains the source b16 which is located @xmath51 southwest of b1 ( see section  3.1 ) .",
    "the spectrum of b2 was extracted at the position of the peak of the continuum near h@xmath26 .",
    "the spectrum centered at c at pa = 80 also contains c@xmath52 and regions southwest of the nucleus of ic  694 .    for extracting the 1-d spectra we used 3 pixel ( @xmath53 ) apertures .",
    "the positions of the slits and the regions for which we extracted spectra are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the fully reduced optical spectra ( not calibrated in flux ) are shown in figures  5.a and 5.b for those regions for which we present line ratios and equivalent widths in table  3 .",
    "the optical line ratios of all the regions are consistent with those of hii as plotted in diagnostic diagrams such those in ho , filippenko , & sargent al .",
    "the visual extinctions were computed from the balmer decrement .",
    "our nicmos images of arp  299 reveal an extremely complex morphology . over the past few years",
    "it has been claimed that the nucleus of ic  694 could harbor an obscured agn .",
    "an important result of the nicmos imaging is that no dominant point - like source is seen anywhere in the system that would be a logical agn candidate .",
    "the nic1 f110 m image ( figure  2.1 ) of ic  694 shows that the nucleus is resolved into at least three individual sources within a region of about 0.86 ( @xmath54pc ) in diameter",
    ". these sources could be either young stellar clusters , or extinction shadows against a smooth source .",
    "source b1 ( see figure  7b for identifications ) in ngc  3690 appears to be extended at our resolution in the nic1 f110 m image , as does source b2 .",
    "the curves of growth for sources b1 , b2 and b21 for filter nic1 f110 m are shown in figure  6 to illustrate that b2 is clearly extended , whereas b1 appears marginally extended .",
    "as comparison we plot the curve of growth of the source b21 which appears as a point source at our resolution .",
    "sources b1 and b2 are also surrounded by a number of faint sources ( see figure  7b for identifications and table  4 for the relative distances to either b1 or b2 ) .",
    "source c ( which is seen as one source from the ground ) is now resolved into 3 sources that we will refer to as c1 , c2 and c3 ( see table  4 for relative positions ) .",
    "c1 and c2 are extended whereas c3 seems to be point - like at the resolution of the infrared images . the optical wfpc2 image , because of its higher spatial resolution",
    ", shows however that c3 is also extended .",
    "additional sources are located southwest of the c complex ( i.e. , c4 and c5 ) and southeast of b1 ( sources d1 , d2 , d3 ) .",
    "the galaxy ic  694 also shows faint sources , most of them located along the spiral arms ( probably hii regions ) , and labelled as a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 and a6 ( figure  7a ) .",
    "we can place an upper limit to the size of the unresolved sources from the nic f110 m image of @xmath55  ( @xmath56 diffraction limit ) or @xmath57pc for the assumed distance .",
    "however , some of these faint sources appear to be slightly resolved in the wfpc2 image .",
    "a comparison between the nicmos images and the optical wfpc2 f606w image shows dramatically the effects of extinction .",
    "the latter image contains the h@xmath26 emission line , so that low - extinction bright hii regions will show up in this filter .",
    "the most remarkable difference appears in the component ic  694 .",
    "a careful alignment of the optical and near - infrared images to determine the position of the near - infrared peak on the optical image of ic  694 shows that the source ( presumably the nucleus of the galaxy ) is completely obscured in the optical ( see figure  2.a ) .",
    "the spiral arm southwest of a is clearly detected in the optical image .",
    "the wfpc2 image of ngc  3690 shows a closer correspondence with the near - infrared image than for ic  694 , but still some differences are present .",
    "the very high spatial resolution of the wfpc2 image shows that both sources b1 and b2 are detected and extended ( note the morphology of the ground - based continuum image near h@xmath26 where the brightest source is b2 , figure  3 ) , although b2 is much brighter than b1 at optical wavelengths ( as already known from ground - based observations ) .",

    "the masses of these clusters are in the range of @xmath281 . for comparison the masses of the stellar clusters found in other infrared luminous galaxies",
    "are @xmath282 ( scoville et al .",
    "1999 ) , whereas the masses of galactic globular clusters are of the order of @xmath283 ( van der bergh 1995 ) .",
    "given the modest extinctions to the clusters , their deep co bands ( see table 5 ) require little correction . assuming roughly solar metallicity , these band strengths can only be produced by stellar populations of age @xmath0 10 - 30 myr .",
    "the major starforming components in arp 299 show a large range of ages .",
    "even though some uncertainties remain regarding the ages and burst strengths , we find an age gradient from b2 ( @xmath258 11 myr ) to a ( @xmath0 11 myr ) to b1 ( @xmath0 7.5 myr ) , c ( @xmath0 5 myr ) , and c ( 4 myr ) . compared with satyapal et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we derive an older age for source a , assuming that its starburst has had a relatively long duration ( they assumed an instantaneous burst ) , a similar age for source c , and we resolve source b into two bursts of differing ages , one older than and the other younger than their value .",
    "the effective star formation rate ( mass of the newly formed stars over the fwhm of the burst ) is high for component a ( @xmath284 yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "it is moderately high also for b1 ( @xmath285 yr@xmath9 ) and for c ( @xmath286 yr@xmath9 ) ( or @xmath287 yr@xmath9 if the extinction to c is as high as 37 magnitudes ) .",
    "the masses in newly formed stars are about @xmath288 for component a , about @xmath289 for b1 , @xmath290 for c , 1 @xmath291 10@xmath292 @xmath293 for c , and 0.3 @xmath291 10@xmath292 @xmath293 for b2 .",
    "we find a similar range for star formation in very massive stellar clusters .",
    "we have identified 19 supergiant hii regions , and have deduced total stellar masses for them that are similar to the masses of 21 stellar clusters with -15 @xmath258 m@xmath294 @xmath258 -17 .",
    "the hii regions must be young , 5 myr or less , whereas the strong co absorption in the clusters implies typical ages @xmath258 10 myr .",
    "star formation has been occurring contemporaneously throughout the two galaxies over the past 10 - 15 myr , both within and outside of their nuclei .",
    "there appear to be four potentially differing environments for the star formation .",
    "outside of the nuclei and along the spiral arms , there are massive stellar clusters and hii regions . within the nuclear potential wells ,",
    "young stars have formed in numbers one to two orders of magnitude greater than in these clusters . although we can not be sure of the spatial distribution of star formation in the nuclei now , it is plausible that these populations will merge into a single super - cluster , given the high density of young stars and the strong tidal forces that would cause clusters to disintegrate rapidly . in the interaction region ,",
    "components c and c appear to be locations where star formation has occurred on the scale typical of a galaxy nucleus , not an extranuclear cluster .",
    "presumably , there is no nuclear potential well in this region , but the concentration of molecular gas in the interaction has resulted in an exceptionally vigorous star formation episode .",
    "this is also found in other interacting galaxies ( e.g. , vv114 frayer et al .",
    "1999 ; the antennae vigroux et al .",
    "finally , there may be examples of extreme star formation near the galaxy nuclei where infalling gas clouds became unstable and formed stars before falling all the way into the nuclear potential .",
    "one possible example is the region se of the nucleus of ic 694 ( component a ) in the h92@xmath26 measurements of zhao et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and partially resolved into supergiant hii regions in our data .",
    "another possible example is components b1 and b2 .",
    "it is not obvious which should be associated with a galaxy nucleus .",
    "however , we have found that both involve a larger mass of young stars than can be attributed to a supergiant hii region or massive stellar cluster , so it is plausible to assume one is a galaxy nucleus and the other a very nearby star forming region .",
    "_ sources b1 & b2 _ + the measure of stellar dynamics in b2 ( shier et al . 1996 ) suggests a mass of @xmath295 m@xmath2 , whereas from the radio luminosity we have found that only about @xmath296 m@xmath2 is expected from recent star formation .",
    "thus , this object appears to satisfy expectations for a modest mass galaxy nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath297co emission is centered on b1 and has a fwhm of 260 km s@xmath9 ( aalto et al .",
    "1997 ) , possibly indicating a larger mass there , @xmath298 m@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that the co is subject to non - gravitational forces at b1 , or that the stellar population at b2 is not gravitationally bound , so the situation of these two nearby concentrations is not firmly determined by the observations .",
    "if b1 has a mass of @xmath299 m@xmath2 , then the roche radius for b2 is @xmath0 200 pc , about one third of the projected separation of the sources . in this case",
    ", b2 will be undergoing significant tidal evaporation and is in the process of merging into the general stellar distribution around b1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical mass of b2 is similar to the mass of b1 indicated for the recent star formation .",
    "we may be seeing two galaxy nuclei of comparable masses , one older and the other newly formed , orbiting each other at a projected distance 5 - 6 times the roche radii .",
    "the dynamical evolution will be more complex in this situation and should develop more slowly , but will probably have a similar end point .",
    "_ sources c & c _ + sources c and c are well isolated from the galaxy nuclei in the system - they are about 3 kpc from component a and 1.5 kpc from b , projected onto the sky .",
    "they do not appear to lie within any significant potential wells of their own , based on the lack of evidence for an underlying concentration of old , red stars .",
    "this case is particularly strong for c , given how faint it is in the near infrared .",
    "both objects have low velocity dispersions in @xmath297co of 60 - 80 km s@xmath9 ( aalto et al .",
    "given our estimates of the total mass being converted into stars ( table 8) , the low velocity dispersion is consistent with the formation of a bound stellar system .",
    "the relaxation time for such a system can be estimated from the expression in spitzer ( 1987 ) to be long , of order 10@xmath297 yr .",
    "thus , it would appear that c and c represent the formation of stellar systems on the scale of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a further confirmation of this possibility comes from the star formation efficiency .",
    "the gas masses of both c and c are @xmath0 3 @xmath291 10@xmath292 m@xmath2 ( from the @xmath297co measurements of aalto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and our adjusted conversion to h@xmath39 mass , see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the mass of newly formed stars is likely to be @xmath300 10@xmath292 m@xmath2 for both , as indicated in table  8 .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the molecular material in these regions has probably been turned into stars , a situation that favors formation of bound systems .",
    "the effects of tidal forces on this system can be estimated roughly from the roche limit , which is about 500 pc relative to the nucleus of ic 694 .",
    "therefore , the stellar systems may persist for a significant lifetime , so long as they do not approach more closely to the massive nucleus of ic 694 than at present .",
    "they are perhaps best described , given their masses and potential stability , as new dwarf galaxies .    _ supergiant hii regions & stellar clusters _",
    "+ although the giant stellar clusters seen in other starbursts have been described as young globular clusters , the distribution of these objects along spiral arms argues against a literal interpretation of this view . in ic 694 ,",
    "many of these objects lie a few roche radii from the galaxy nucleus in projected distance .",
    "if the larger mass estimate holds for b1 in ngc 3690 , a similar situation holds there .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the clusters that lie relatively close to the massive galaxy nuclei will be subject to strong tidal evaporation and will fade in prominence as the massive stars die and the less massive ones are lost into the surrounding galaxies .",
    "however , clusters that lie relatively far from nuclear mass concentrations may be reasonably stable .",

    "studies using optical or near infrared measures of extinction ( e.g. , satyapal et al . 1999 ) will significantly underestimate its importance and will deduce erroneous values for the critical parameters characterizing the star forming activity .",

    "we have used evolutionary synthesis modeling and other arguments to assign ages to these various manifestations of star formation , finding that they have all persisted for at least @xmath303myr .",
    "thus , arp  299 has been in a condition similar to what we observe now for about this period of time , with all or nearly all the varieties of star forming environments active .",
    "arp 299 should be similar to other luminous infrared galaxies .",
