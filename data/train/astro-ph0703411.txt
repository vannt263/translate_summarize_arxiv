    "a series of papers on radio supernovae ( rsne ) has established the radio detection and , in a number of cases , radio evolution for approximately two dozen type  ib / c supernovae ( sne ) ( because the differences between the sn optical classes are slight ",
    "type  ib show strong he i absorption while type  ic show weak he i absorption  and there are no obvious radio differences , we shall often refer to the classes as type  ib / c . ) , and the rest type  ii sne .",
    "a much larger list of more than 100 additional sne have low radio upper limits ( see _ http://rsd-www.nrl.navy.mil/7213/weiler/kwdata/rsnhead.html_ ) .    in this extensive study of the radio emission from sne , several effects",
    "have been noted :    * type  ia sne are not radio emitters to the detection limit of the vla * type  ib / c sne are radio luminous with steep spectral indices ( generally @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ) and have a fast turn - on / turn - off , usually peaking at 6 cm near or before optical maximum . *",
    "type  ii sne show a range of radio luminosities with flatter spectral indices ( generally @xmath2 ) and a relatively slow turn - on / turn - off , usually peaking at 6 cm significantly after optical maximum .",
    "measurements of the multi - frequency radio light curves and their evolution with time show the density and structure of the csm , evidence for possible binary companions , clumpiness or filamentation in the presupernova wind , mass - loss rates and changes therein for the presupernova stellar system and , through stellar evolution models , estimates of the zams presupernova stellar mass and the stages through which the star passed on its way to explosion .",
    "all known rsne appear to share common properties of :    * nonthermal synchrotron emission with high brightness temperature . * a decrease in absorption with time , resulting in a smooth , rapid turn - on first at shorter wavelengths and later at longer wavelengths . *",
    "a power - law decline of the flux density with time at each wavelength after maximum flux density ( optical depth @xmath3 ) is reached at that wavelength .",
    "the characteristic rsn radio light curves arise from the competing effects of slowly declining non - thermal radio emission and more rapidly declining thermal or non - thermal absorption yielding a rapid turn - on and slower turn - off of the radio emission at any single frequency .",
    "this characteristic light curve shape is illustrated in fig .  1 - 2 for sn 1979c and sn 1980k . since absorption processes are greater at lower frequencies , transition from optically thick to optically thin ( turn - on ) occurs first at higher frequencies and later at lower frequencies .    chevalier ( 1982a , 1982b ) has proposed that the relativistic electrons and enhanced magnetic field necessary for synchrotron emission arise from the sn blastwave interacting with a relatively high density csm which has been ionized and heated by the initial uv / x - ray flash .",
    "this csm density ( @xmath4 ) , which decreases as an inverse power , s , of the radius , r , from the star , is presumed to have been established by a presupernova stellar wind with mass - loss rate , @xmath5 , and velocity , @xmath6 , ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) from a massive stellar progenitor or companion . for a constant mass - loss rate and constant wind velocity @xmath8 .",
    "this ionized csm is the source of some or all of the initial thermal gas absorption .",
    "additionally , chevalier ( 1998 ) has proposed that synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) may play a role in some objects .    a rapid rise in the observed radio flux density results from a decrease in these absorption processes as the radio emitting region expands and the absorption processes , either internal or along the line - of - sight , decrease .",
    "( 1990 ) have suggested that this csm can be `` clumpy '' or `` filamentary , '' leading to a slower radio turn - on , and montes _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) have proposed the possible presence of a distant ionized medium along the line - of - sight that is sufficiently distant from the explosion that it is unaffected by the blastwave and can cause a spectral turn - over at low radio frequencies .",
    "in addition to clumps or filaments , the csm may be radially structured with significant density irregularities such as rings , disks , shells , or gradients .",
    "weiler _ et al . _",
    "( 1986 , 1990 ) and montes _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) adopted a parameterized model which has been updated in weiler _",
    "the model includes an intrinsic sychrotron emission , which is characterized by a spectral index @xmath9 and declines with time as a power law with exponent @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and an attenuation mostly produced by _ f - f _ absorption from the ionized csm , but also , especially at early times , by sychrotron self - absorption . each _",
    "i - th _ absorption process is characterized by a power law decline with slope @xmath12 .",
    "various possibilities for the _ f - f _ absorption are included , namely ( i ) homogeneous and ( ii ) clumpy or filamentary absorption by gas in the csm , as well as ( iii ) the one originating in a possible foreground hii region .",
    "the homogeneous absorption is produced by an ionized medium that completely covers the emitting source , and additional attenuation may be produced by an inhomogeneous medium ( `` clumpy absorption '' ; see natta & panagia 1984 for a more detailed discussion of attenuation in inhomogeneous media ) .",
    "the distant _ f - f _ absorption is produced by a homogeneous medium which completely covers the source but is so far from the sn progenitor that it is not affected by the expanding sn blastwave and is constant in time .",
    "since it is physically realistic and may be needed in some rsne where radio observations have been obtained at early times and high frequencies , the model also includes the possibility for an internal absorption term .",
    "this internal absorption term consists of two parts  synchrotron self - absorption , and mixed , _ f - f _ absorption due to thermal gas coexisting with the non - thermal emitting electrons .",
    "the success of the basic parameterization and modeling has been shown in the good correspondence between the model fits and the data for all subtypes of rsne : e.g. , type ib sn  1983n ( sramek _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 ) , type ic sn  1990b ( van dyk _",
    "1993a ) , and type ii sn  1979c ( weiler _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , 1992a , and montes _ et al . _ 2000 ) and sn  1980k ( weiler _ et al .",
    "_ 1992b , and montes _ et al .",
    "note that after day @xmath13 , the evolution of the radio emission from both sn  1979c and sn  1980k deviates from the expected model evolution and that sn  1979c shows a sinusoidal modulation in its flux density prior to day @xmath144000 ( se fig . 1 and 2 ) .    additionally , in their study of the radio emission from sn  1986j , weiler _ et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that the simple chevalier model could not describe the relatively slow turn - on .",
    "they therefore included terms described mathematically by a clump optical depth , @xmath15 , in the model equations .",
    "this extension greatly improved the quality of the fit and was interpreted by weiler _",
    "( 1990 ) to represent the presence of filaments or clumps in the csm .",
    "such a clumpiness in the wind material was again required for modeling the radio data from sn  1988z ( van dyk _",
    "_ 1993b , and williams _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and sn  1993j ( van dyk _",
    "since that time , evidence for filamentation in the envelopes of sne has also been found from optical and uv observations ( filippenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , and spyromilio 1994 ) .      from the chevalier model ( 1982a , 1982b )",
    ", the turn - on of the radio emission for rsne provides a measure of the presupernova mass - loss rate to wind velocity ratio ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "( 1986 ) derived this ratio for the case of pure , external absorption by a homogeneous medium . however , weiler _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) propose several possible origins for absorption and generalize eq .",
    "16 of weiler _ et al . _",
    "( 1986 ) to    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the exponent of the power - law growth of the sn front radius , @xmath19 .    since the appearance of optical lines for measuring sn ejecta velocities",
    "is often delayed a bit relative to the time of the explosion , for convenience they take the reference time to be @xmath20 = 45 days . also , because many sn measurements indicate velocities of @xmath21 km s@xmath22 , one usually assumes @xmath23 km s@xmath22  and takes values of @xmath24 k , @xmath25 km s@xmath22  ( which is appropriate for a rsg wind ) , @xmath26 days from best fits to the radio data for each rsn , and @xmath27 or @xmath28 , as appropriate ( weiler _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , and sramek & weiler 2003 ) .",
    "the optical depth term @xmath29 used by weiler _",
    "( 1986 ) is extended by weiler _",
    "( 2001 ) and they identify at least three possible absorption regimes : 1 ) absorption by a homogeneous external medium , 2 ) absorption by a clumpy or filamentary external medium with a statistically large number of clumps , and 3 ) absorption by a clumpy or filamentary medium with a statistically small number of clumps .",
    "these three cases have different formulations for @xmath29 which are described in detail by weiler _",
    "mass - loss rate estimates from radio absorption obtained in this manner tend to be @xmath30 for type ib / c sne and @xmath31 for type ii sne .",
    "estimates for some of the best studied sne are given in weiler _",
    "( 2002 ) . as discussed by panagia _",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) , the high mass loss rates measured for snii confirm that their progenitors are red supergiants with original masses above 8 @xmath32 .",
    "a particularly interesting case of mass - loss from an rsn is sn  1993j , where detailed radio observations are available starting only a few days after explosion ( fig .",
    "( 1994 ) find evidence for a changing mass - loss rate ( fig .",
    "4 ) for the presupernova star which was as high as @xmath33 approximately 1000 years before explosion and decreased to @xmath34 just before explosion , resulting in a relatively flat density profile of @xmath35 .",
    "fransson & bjrgsson ( 1998 ) have suggested that the observed behavior of the _ f - f _ absorption for sn  1993j could alternatively be explained in terms of a systematic decrease of the electron temperature in the circumstellar material as the sn expands .",
    "it is not clear , however , what the physical process is which determines why such a cooling might occur efficiently in sn  1993j , but not in sne such as sn  1979c and sn  1980k where no such behavior is seen . also , recent x - ray observations with the rosat of sn  1993j indicate a non-@xmath36 csm density surrounding the sn progenitor ( immler _ et al . _ 2001 ) , with a density gradient of @xmath37 .        moreover , changes in presupernova mass - loss rates are not unusual .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) find that type ii sn  1979c had a slow increase in its radio light curve after day @xmath38 ( see fig .  1 ) and",
    "type ii sn  1980k showed a steep decline in flux density at all wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "2 ) by a factor of @xmath39 occurring between day @xmath143700 and day @xmath144900 montes _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) .      in the process of analyzing a full decade of radio measurements from sn  1979c , weiler _ et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1992a ) found evidence for a significant , quasi - periodic , variation in the amplitude of the radio emission at all wavelengths of @xmath40 with a period of 1575 days or @xmath41 years ( see fig .  1 at age @xmath42 4000 days ) .",
    "they interpreted the variation as due to a minor ( @xmath43 ) density modulation , with a period of @xmath44 years , on the larger , relatively constant presupernova stellar mass - loss rate .",
    "since such a long period is inconsistent with most models for stellar pulsations , they concluded that the modulation may be produced by interaction of a binary companion in an eccentric orbit with the stellar wind from the presupernova star .",
    "this concept was strengthened by more detailed calculations for a binary model from schwarz & pringle ( 1996 ) . since that time",
    ", the presence of binary companions has been suggested for the progenitors of sn  1987a ( podsiadlowski _ et al .",

    "_ 2001 ) , and sn  2001ig ( ryder _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , indicating that binaries may be common in presupernova systems .      a reanalysis of the radio data for sn  1978k from ryder _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) clearly shows flux density evolution characteristic of normal type ii sne .",
    "additionally , the data indicate the need for a time - independent , free - free absorption component .",
    "( 1997 ) interpreted this constant absorption term as indicative of the presence of hii along the line - of - sight to sn  1978k , perhaps as part of an hii region or a distant circumstellar shell associated with the sn progenitor . a high - dispersion spectrum of sn  1978k at the wavelength range @xmath45    obtained by chu _",
    "( 1999 ) showed narrow nebular h@xmath46 and [ n ii ] emission with a high [ n ii ] 6583/h@xmath46  ratio of @xmath47 indicative of a stellar ejecta nebula .",
    "these data suggest that the nebula detected towards sn  1978k is probably part of a large , dense , structured circumstellar envelope .",
    "recently panagia _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) have discussed the radio observations of 27 type ia supernovae ( snia ) observed over two decades with the very large array .",
    "no snia has been detected so far in the radio , implying a very low density for any possible circumstellar material established by the progenitor , or progenitor system , before explosion .",
    "they derive @xmath48 upper limits to a steady mass - loss rate for individual snia systems as low as @xmath49 m@xmath50 yr@xmath22 , discriminating strongly against white dwarf accretion via a stellar wind from a massive binary companion in the symbiotic star .",
    "however , in the `` single degenerate '' scenario , a white dwarf accreting from a relatively low mass companion via a high efficiency ( @xmath51 % ) roche lobe overflow is still consistent with such limits .",
    "the `` double degenerate '' merger scenario also can not be excluded .",
    "the success of the basic parameterization and modeling is shown in the good agreement between the model fits and the data for all subtypes of rsne .",
    "thus , the radio emission from sne appears to be relatively well understood in terms of blastwave interaction with a structured csm and allows description of such progenitor system properties as mass - loss rate , change in mass - loss rate , filamentation or clumpiness , binarity , and remote hii , as well as estimates of progenitor properties .",
