    "simulating the real - time evolution of large quantum systems is one of the major challenges of modern theoretical physics , ranging from condensed matter physics to high - energy physics @xcite . unlike quantum systems in thermal equilibrium for which quantum monte carlo simulations have proven to be an extremely powerful tool , there is no generally applicable approach to far - from - equilibrium quantum systems : exact diagonalization techniques become technically impossible for large systems due to the exponential growth of the hilbert space with the system size . on the other hand",
    ", the application of the quantum monte carlo method based on importance sampling fails for real - time simulations due to a severe sign or complex weight problem . for gapped 1-dimensional systems with small entanglement , however , tensor network states underlying the density matrix renormalization group @xcite provide a good basis for simulating the real - time dynamics for moderate time intervals @xcite .",
    "moreover , simulations in the classical statistical or truncated wigner approximation are valid in the limit of large occupation numbers which appear , for instance , at the early stages of relativistic heavy - ion collision or in the study of non - perturbative fermion production @xcite .",
    "finally , there have been attempts to apply stochastic quantization to real - time problems based on the complex langevin equation even though the problem of run - away trajectories is not completely settled yet @xcite .",
    "one reason for the complexity of simulating the real - time evolution of large quantum systems on classical computers is the fact that isolated quantum systems tend to evolve into complicated entangled states such as those of schrdinger s cat .",
    "for this reason , it was proposed to use specifically designed quantum devices  so - called quantum simulators  to mimic quantum systems that are difficult to simulate classically due to the high degree of entanglement @xcite . due to the rapid development of atomic , molecular , and optical ( amo ) physics in recent years ,",
    "it has become possible to realize quantum simulators in systems of ultracold atoms @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "applications in atomic and condensed matter physics @xcite as well as in a particle physics context @xcite are widely discussed",
    ".    furthermore , real quantum systems are usually not isolated but coupled to a dissipative environment resulting in decoherence and the suppression of schrdinger cat states .",
    "hence , it should be simpler to simulate quantum systems on a classical computer if we suppress the unitary hamiltonian evolution and consider a pure , or at least sufficiently strong , dissipative coupling to an environment . the corresponding dynamics",
    "is then governed by the kossakowski - lindblad equation @xcite , which is the most general non - unitary , markovian time - evolution equation for a density matrix which preserves the basic properties of hermiticity and positive semi - definiteness .",
    "the study of the interplay between the unitary hamiltonian dynamics and the dissipative markovian dynamics which may result in non - equilibrium ( quantum ) phase transitions has attracted much interest in recent years from both the theoretical and the experimental side @xcite .    in this publication , we investigate the real - time evolution of large open quantum spin systems whose dynamics is entirely driven by specific randomized quantum measurements performed on pairs of neighboring spins .",
    "the measurement processes give rise to a dissipative coupling to the environment , such that the system is described by the kossakowski - lindblad equation which can be solved with an efficient loop - cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "unlike quantum trajectory methods , which are widely used in quantum optics to solve the kossakowski - lindblad equation and which scale exponentially with the size of the hilbert space @xcite , we can simulate the real - time evolution of the quantum system over arbitrarily long time intervals in any spatial dimension since the computational effort scales only linearly with the spatial volume .",
    "we then find that the system is driven from an initial equilibrium state to a new equilibrium at final times .",
    "compared to a previous study of some of the authors @xcite , we investigate a wider class of dissipative processes with different symmetries as well as using a variety of initial density matrices , corresponding to the @xmath0 heisenberg model as well as the quantum xy model at low temperatures .",
    "we emphasize that the associated hamiltonians are only employed for preparing the initial density matrices but not for driving the subsequent real - time dynamics .",
    "more specifically , we give a detailed account of the equilibration dynamics for the different dissipative processes .",
    "we show that the symmetry of the specific process determines the time scales which govern the approach towards a new equilibrium phase at late times .",
    "most notably , we find a slow equilibration if the dissipative process conserves any of the magnetization fourier modes . in these cases ,",
    "the dynamics can be interpreted as a diffusion process of the conserved quantity .",
