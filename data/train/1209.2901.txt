    "* yu - oh proof of quantum contextuality and notations . * explicitly , the 13 rays take the forms corresponding to vectors @xmath35 for @xmath11 as shown in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the orthogonality relationships among the 13 rays are schematically represented in fig.2(a ) .",
    "correspondingly , we can define a set of 13 observables , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , here we use notation @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath38 are commuting , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are orthogonal , they are co - measurable ( compatible ) observables so that their correlation is well defined in quantum mechanics . in contrast , it is always well defined in a non - contextual hidden variable theory regardless of whether they are compatible or not , so that each outcome @xmath12 of observable @xmath41 always takes values @xmath42 . in quantum theory for the density operator @xmath43 of an arbitrary quantum state , the outcome of an observable is , @xmath44 , and the correlation is , @xmath45 , provided they are compatible",
    ". then different results are expected from non - contextual hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics depending on whether the inequality ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) is satisfied or violated .",
    "so the experimental test is only to check this inequality .",
    "additionally , a simpler inequality is also proposed which involves only four @xmath33-type rays @xmath46 , inequality @xmath47 should be satisfied by non - contextual hidden variable theories , while quantum mechanics expects that it should be violated and the right hand side is @xmath48 .",
    "* preparation of arbitrary qutrits and readout . * after initialization of the electron spin to @xmath3 , two channels of resonant microwave pulses are applied to manipulate the spin state .",
    "they are generated by individual source and timing controlled by individual rf switches , and then combined together to a 16 watt amplifier .",
    "the amplified microwave signal is then delivered to the sample by a 20 @xmath49 m copper wire which is mounted on the diamond surface . for each of the microwave pulse",
    ", its phase @xmath50 determines the rotation axis and the pulse duration @xmath51 determines the rotation angle .",
    "e.g. if we apply a mw1 pulse to state @xmath21 , and define @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the duration of one circle of rabi oscillation for mw1 , then the result state is @xmath54 .",
    "this operation equals to rotate the state with @xmath55 angle around an axis in x - y plane , where the angle between the rotation axis and x - axis is @xmath50 .",
    "the readout is by measuring the intensities of fluorescence by two rabi oscillations and fit the data to those two curves .",
    "define @xmath56 and @xmath57 to represent the percentage of @xmath3 among @xmath58 subspace and @xmath59 subspace . by fitting the two rabi curves we can extract @xmath56 and @xmath57 . by the normalization condition",
    ", we get the projection result : @xmath60 .",
    "the projection results of 25 measurements for each state are combined together to calculate the 24 pairs of correlations .",
    "this readout method in nv center system is useful to reduce the effect of decoherence , in particular for depolarizing noise .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows an example , a test state @xmath61 is prepared .",
    "rabi oscillation of mw1 ( upper , orange curve ) shows that the superposed state between @xmath3 and @xmath27 is @xmath62 , while rabi oscillation of mw2 ( below , blue curve ) shows that the percentage of @xmath28 is zero .",
    "so the form of state @xmath61 is confirmed .",
    "the detailed information of all states preparation and readout is presented in fig.3(c ) .    in our experiment ,",
    "the pulse length is determined by an additional rabi oscillation of @xmath3 state ( fig.1(d ) ) which acts as a benchmark , and is updated in every two hours to ensure the accuracy . all states preparation and measurements",
    "are programming controlled and the experiment can run automatically for several days .",
    "* measurement of 24 correlations . * the 24 pair correlations involved in the inequality ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) can be written in the form as @xmath63 .",
    "we construct an orthogonal set of rays @xmath64 which constitutes a complete basis as shown in fig.2 , note that ray @xmath65 may not necessarily be within the existing 13 rays in yu - oh scheme .",
    "all involved rays in this work can be found in fig.2(b , c ) .",
    "now , we have @xmath66 , where parameter @xmath67 is measured outcome of observable @xmath68 , so four terms on the right hand side of the above equation can be rewritten respectively as , @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ; and @xmath71 ; @xmath72 .",
    "in the last three equations , @xmath73 means the state @xmath40 is measured by projective ray @xmath68 , the corresponding two states , @xmath74 , are actually orthogonal to each other thus the measured outcome is very small .",
    "so now the correlations are also realized by projective measurements .",
    "alternatively , we can measure @xmath75 in a framework of quantum theory , such that the outcome of @xmath76 is the square root of a multiplication of three quantities , which are expectation values of @xmath68,@xmath77 for the prepared qutrits , and outcome of the projective measurement of state @xmath39 by projector @xmath77 .",

    "<S> the violation of bell type inequalities depends on specified quantum entanglement state . </S>",
    "<S> the state - independent kochen - specker theorem is proven by a logical contradiction which applies to systems with dimension of hilbert space larger than three .    </S>",

    "<S> our experimental results strongly agree with quantum contextuality manifested in a state - independent characteristic .    </S>",
    "<S> a nv center comprises a substitutional nitrogen atom instead of a carbon atom and an adjacent lattice vacancy in diamond , which provides an electronic spin @xcite , see fig.1 . </S>",

    "<S> a qubit of nv center , which involves @xmath2 and a single spin transition to either @xmath6 or @xmath7 , has been widely demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> a qutrit is a superposed three level state which will involve all three energy levels of the electronic spin in a nv center . the precise control of an arbitrary qutrit in nv center is also demonstrated experimentally in a quantum information processing scheme in our group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a perfect experimental setup to test quantum contextuality of yu - oh scheme @xcite , for a large variants of quantum states to illustrate the state - independent property .    </S>",
    "<S> the yu - oh proof of quantum contextuality involves arbitrary qutrits and 13 projection measurement rays @xcite . for a given basis @xmath8 which are realized by three electronic spin energy levels of a nv center in our experiment , @xmath9 </S>",

    "<S> , this inequality should be violated by quantum mechanics since it is expected by quantum theory that @xmath16 , no matter what kind of quantum states are measured .    in nv center system , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental test of quantum contextuality is to prepare arbitrary qutrits , measure 13 observables and 24 correlations for each qutrit . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to find whether the inequality ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) is violated or not in a state - independent nature . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment is carried out in type iia sample diamond ( nitrogen concentration @xmath17 ppm ) , most of the atoms ( 12c , natural abundance of @xmath18 ) have no nuclear spin , result in a very pure spin bath and thus the nv electron spin has long enough coherence time for manipulation and readout of the qutrit . </S>",

    "<S> the fluorescence of @xmath21 state is about @xmath22 brighter than the @xmath23 states , so the spin state of nv center can be readout by applying a short laser ( 0.3 @xmath24s ) pulse and recording the excited fluorescence at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> two microwave sources are used with different frequencies : mw1 and mw2 . </S>",
    "<S> mw1 frequency is resonant with the transition @xmath25=0 @xmath26 @xmath25=-1 , and mw2 with @xmath25=0 @xmath26 @xmath25=1 , which can create superposed states of @xmath3 with @xmath27 or @xmath28,respectively . </S>",

    "<S> . other types of qutrits can be similarly prepared without any experimental difficulty since they need same techniques . with arbitrary qutrits prepared , </S>",
    "<S> the scheme of measurement is the same : measure 13 observables and 24 pairs of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we realize each measurement of the 13 observables by a qutrit rotation such that the projector @xmath30 can be transformed to @xmath31 , which is realized by applying either mw1 or mw2 or both , followed by a readout of the intensity of florescence corresponding to the population in state @xmath3 by normalization , see fig.3 and methods . </S>",
    "<S> the readout can be made by two rabi oscillations to fit the relative percentages between @xmath3 and @xmath5 , then the form of the superposed qutrit can be found . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme of measuring 24 correlations is implemented by measuring the joint probabilities or by multiplication the outcomes of compatible observables , see methods .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiment results are presented in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> each experimental data ( point ) in rabi oscillation is the averaged value which is repeated for @xmath32 times . for each prepared qutrit </S>",
    "<S> , two rabi oscillations , in which each contains 24 points , are used to extract one outcome for one observable . </S>",
    "<S> we have 13 pure states prepared , for each input state , fig.4(a ) shows experimental values of outcomes of 13 observables , fig.4(b ) are theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> they agree well with each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus a simpler inequality involving only four @xmath33-type observables @xcite is clearly violated for all input states . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4(c ) shows two pure states as examples , the 13 outcomes of observables agree well with theoretical expectation . </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in fig.4(d ) which includes measured correlations . </S>",
    "<S> clearly for each prepared state , the inequality ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) is violated . </S>",
    "<S> all results are very close to theoretical prediction of quantum mechanics with range 8.33(-0.2,+0.14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that some results are larger than theoretical value 8.33 is that , the measured outcomes are fitted with standard rabi oscillations , so the error fluctuations can be on both directions . averaged result is 8.31 which is about @xmath34 of 8.33 . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the state - independent violation of ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) is convincing .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the inequality ( [ yuoh - inequality ] ) is clearly violated thus the state - independent quantum contextuality is confirmed experimentally in a natural qutrit of nitrogen - vacancy center of diamond at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this real qutrit may close the possible loophole appeared in such as photonic systems induced by the post - selection technique . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the first experimental test of quantum contextuality in solid - state system , and provides new evidences in a most fundamental form that quantum mechanics is contextual . </S>"
