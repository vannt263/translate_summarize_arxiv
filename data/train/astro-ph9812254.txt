    "it is well known that doppler beaming causes radio samples selected on the basis of a flux density cutoff at high frequencies to be biased towards small orientation angles with respect to the observer s line of sight . in order to properly test unification schemes of radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , it is crucial to define samples not affected by such bias in orientation . with this in mind among other motivations",
    ", we have defined a new sample of radio galaxies from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite , selecting as candidates those features apparently related as single objects , with emission over most of their extent , and fulfilling the following restrictions : _",
    "i ) _ declination above + 60@xmath0 ; _ ii ) _ angular size greater than 4 ; _ iii ) _ total flux density at 1.4 ghz greater than 100 mjy .",
    "candidates have been observed with the vla in its b and c configurations at 1.4 and 5 ghz in order to remove possible random coincidences of nearby unrelated objects , but without overlooking any possible peculiar radio structure , and to sort out the core emission in complex structures , necessary to properly identify optical counterparts . with work almost reaching completion ,",
    "the sample comprises a total of 85 objects .",
    "a detailed description of the sample will be presented elsewhere .",
    "one of the sources in our sample is j2114 + 820 , detected in the nvss as a 6 large radio source with a total flux density of 480 mjy . due to its prominent flat spectrum core , j2114 + 820 also belongs to the caltech - jodrell bank flat - spectrum sample @xcite and to a sample of optically bright flat spectrum sources @xcite .",
    "it has a redshift of 0.084 @xcite .",
    "its projected linear size is @xmath1500 kpc and its total power p(1.4 ghz ) = @xmath2 w / hz ( we assume h@xmath3=75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath3=0.5 ) .",
    "in the frame of the investigation of the radio galaxies in our sample , we have made vla , merlin and evn observations of j2114 + 820 , mapping its radio structure from kiloparsec to parsec scales .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show a vla map of j2114 + 820 at 1.4 ghz , resulting from the combination of b and c configuration data obtained on november 1995 and february 1996 , respectively .",
    "the radio structure is dominated by a prominent and unresolved core .",
    "there is a jet extending towards the north - west , and a weaker counter - jet in opposite direction .",
    "both , jet and counter - jet , end up in diffuse lobes of emission with s - shaped morphology . the total power and the radio structure of j2114 + 820 support its classification as a fr - i type radio galaxy .     in p.a .",
    "11@xmath0 was used for convolution . the lowest contour ( at 3@xmath5 of the rms of the image )",
    "is 0.369 mjy / beam .",

    "contours increase in powers of 1.5 . ]",
    "the resulting map after calibrating and imaging 1.66 ghz merlin data obtained on june 1997 is displayed in figure [ fig2 ] . here",
    "again we observe a strong and unresolved core , with a very faint and slightly bent jet directed towards the north - west .",
    "the jet is not smooth , but dominated by two main components at distances of @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the core , respectively .",
    "simultaneously with merlin , the evn observed j2114 + 820 also at 1.66 ghz , with antennas at effelsberg ( germany ) , simeiz ( ukraine ) , medicina and noto ( italy ) , onsala ( sweden ) , westerbork ( the netherlands ) , torun ( poland ) , cambridge and jodrell bank ( u.k . ) .",
    "the evn map , in figure [ fig3 ] , shows a compact structure slightly elongated in the direction of the main jet .",
    "data can be fitted with two gaussian components ( table [ tab2 ] ) , in a manner fully consistent with results from vlba observations at 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "combination of evn and merlin data does not add more information since the jet appears completely resolved at the intermediate angular resolution provide by the combination of both interferometers .     of the rms of the image ) is 0.92 mjy / beam .",

    ".gaussian fit parameters of the compact ( evn ) structure of j2114 + 820 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we made observations of the optical counterpart of j2114 + 820 with the 2.2 m telescope at the calar alto observatory ( spain ) on september 1997 , making use of the direct imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) .",
    "the r - filter image of the field of j2114 + 820 after a 300 second exposure in figure [ fig4 ] shows a bright galaxy coincident with the radio core position ( the seeing is @xmath9 ) .",
    "the brightness profile of this galaxy is consistent with that of an elliptical ( r@xmath10 ) harboring an unresolved central component associated with the active nucleus .",
    "there are also hints of interaction of this galaxy with one ( or maybe two ) dwarf galaxy in the surroundings .",
    "atmospheric conditions prevented us from obtaining a reliable photometric calibration of our data .        the spectrum of j2114 + 820 is displayed in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we confirm the redshift and main features of the spectrum reported in @xcite .",
    "j2114 + 820 exhibits strong broad balmer lines , but not only in the core region , but also at distances up to 4 kpc from the center , indicating the existence of high velocity gas over large extensions of the galaxy .",
    "j2114 + 820 can be classified as a low power fr - i radio galaxy . according to current unification schemes of radio loud",
    "agn s @xcite , fr - i radio sources constitute the parent population of bl - lac type objects , which are characterized by the absence of broad emission lines ( at most , only weak broad lines have occasionally been observed in bl - lac type objects @xcite ) . in consequence , fr - i sources should not show such emission lines , contrary to what we observe in j2114 + 820 . in this sense ,",
    "j2114 + 820 hardly fits the requirements of unification schemes .",
    "another peculiarity of this galaxy is the evidence of high velocity gas at distances as large as 4 kpc from the core , a fact not common in elliptical galaxies which are relatively poor in gas .",
    "new observations are being analyzed in order to bring j2114 + 820 into a coherent scenario ."
