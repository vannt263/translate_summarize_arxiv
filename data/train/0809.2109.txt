    "in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath0 transport properties of metals are strongly affected by superconductive fluctuations .",
    "for example , in the temperature region @xmath1 , where fluctuations are the most pronounced , drude conductivity acquires noticeable aslamazov - larkin , maki - thompson , and density - of - states ( dos ) corrections .",
    "many other kinetic and thermodynamic coefficients such as magnetic susceptibility , heat conductivity , hall coefficient , and ultrasonic attenuation are also modified by fluctuations .",
    "one may consult recent book ( ref .  ) for exhaustive overview of results and literature in this field .    mostly immediately after the pioneering works on superconductive fluctuations ,  @xcite it was noticed that analog of the ac josephson effect may survive in the normal state above the critical temperature .",
    "@xcite the latter is also attributed to the formation of fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "indeed , consider weak transparency tunnel junction between two superconductors . in this case",
    "josephson current is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the josephson frequency and current amplitude @xmath4 is proportional to the product of superconductive order parameters @xmath5 , taken from the left ( @xmath6 ) and right ( @xmath7 ) to the contact area .",
    "above the critical temperature josephson current vanishes @xmath8 since order parameter is zero in average @xmath9 .",
    "however , current squared @xmath10 , which gives noise of the josephson current , is apparently not zero due to nontrivial average @xmath11 of space and time fluctuating order parameters . as a consequence , noise power spectrum @xmath12 , defined as the fourier transform of josephson current - current correlation function , shows distinctive peak at the josephson frequency @xmath13 , which is experimentally an accessible effect .",
    "the peak height @xmath14 is a strong function of @xmath15 , usually some power law , which makes it possible to detect noise signal in the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath16 .",
    "although this observation was there for a long time , the interest to it was recently revived .",
    "it was stressed  @xcite that measurements of the josephson current noise may be especially fruitful in studies of the high  temperature superconductivity .",
    "indeed , whether superconductive pairing fluctuations exist in the pseudogap regime of the high@xmath0 materials may be probed by the josephson tunneling .",
    "thus , existence of the josephson effect above @xmath0 may be thought as the precursor of superconductivity .",
    "so far fluctuations of the josephson current above the critical temperature were studied either for the narrow contacts  @xcite , taking into account only temporal fluctuations of the order parameter , or for the mesoscopic rings  @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that in the planar geometry of the tunnel junction , where spatial variations of the superconductive order parameter have to be accounted for , peak in the current noise spectrum is more pronounced , especially , for the non  symmetric junction configurations .",
    "motivated by the ongoing experiments  @xcite and possible applications in probing pseudogap regime of high@xmath0 materials , we revisit problem of the josephson current noise above @xmath0 and study noise in the planar geometry of a tunnel junction . within this work we focus on the temperature range @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ginzburg number . in this",
    "regime fluctuations can be considered as small and can be treated in perturbation theory .",
    "the natural expansion parameter , which measures strength of the superconductive fluctuations , is @xmath19 .",
    "the main results of the present work may be summarized as follows : ( i ) for symmetric wide junctions , when both electrodes are in the fluctuating regime , and contact area @xmath20 is large as compared to the square of the superconductive coherence length , @xmath21 , josephson current noise spectrum @xmath22 has a lorentzian  like shape .",
    "the peak height scales in temperature as @xmath23 and depends quadratically on both tunnel conductance of the junction @xmath24 and the ginzburg number @xmath18 .",
    "for the lowest temperature @xmath25 , which is allowed by the applicability of the perturbation theory , strength of the noise is given by @xmath26 .",
    "of course , experimentally , noise is maximal right at the transition @xmath27 ; however , in this case it is very difficult to make any quantitative predictions theoretically .",
    "thus , @xmath28 gives an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "( ii ) for the narrow , @xmath29 , symmetric junctions we find also a lorentzian  like shape of @xmath12 , which is again quadratic in both @xmath24 and @xmath18 ; however , temperature dependence of the peak height is different @xmath30 .",
    "the estimate for the noise power at the most vicinity of the transition is @xmath31 .",
    "( iii ) in the case of non  symmetric junctions , when one electrode is already superconducting while another is fluctuating , noise has lorentzian form .",
    "the temperature dependence for the peak height in this case is the same as for wide symmetric junction , which , however , appears already in the first order of the ginzburg number and contains large prefactor @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the superconductive gap ) .",
    "( iv ) corrections to the current noise above @xmath34 are not exhausted by the josephson current contribution only .",
    "in addition , superconductive fluctuations deplete normal ",
    "metal dos at the fermi energy , which changes tunnel conductance .",
    "the latter translates into the current noise correction @xmath35 via fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "this effect is linear in @xmath36 and @xmath18 , logarithmic in temperature @xmath37 , and has an opposite sign as compared to the josephson current contribution .",
    "the rest is organized as follows : in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ sec - formalism ] ) we present in a concise form our technical method , keldysh nonlinear @xmath38-model , which will be used through out the paper in calculation of the current noise power .",
