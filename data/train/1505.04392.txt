    "it is known that a connection exists between the thermodynamics and gravity .",
    "this connection was first investigated in the works of bardeen , carter and hawking @xcite . in this work",
    ", it was suggested that an analogy exists between the laws of thermodynamics and gravitational physics . however , the existence of this connection was only established after the discovery of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the hawking radiation comes from black holes , as black holes behave as hot bodies with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole .",
    "the black holes also have an entropy associated with them , and this entropy is proportional to the area of the horizon @xcite .",
    "thus , the black hole physics establishes a connection between the laws of thermodynamics and gravitational physics .    motivated by the relation between thermodynamics and gravity ,",
    "it has been proposed that gravity is actually only an emergent thermodynamic phenomena .",
    "this formalism in which gravity is described as a emergent phenomena is called the jacobson formalism @xcite . in this formalism , the einstein field equation can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in this formalism einstein field equation is viewed as an equation of state for the spacetime .",
    "it is possible to derive the friedmann equations from the clausius relation @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the entropy was taken to be proportional to the apparent horizon of frw universe .",
    "thus , if @xmath7 is the area of the apparent horizon with temperature @xmath8 , then the entropy @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 it may be noted that even though the entropy is proportional to the area of the apparent horizon , the temperature is not proportional to the surface gravity @xmath11 . in fact , it is possible to express the surface gravity @xmath11 as @xmath12 it has been possible to use the misner - sharp energy relation to express the dynamical friedman equation in the form of the first law of thermodynamics @xcite . however , for consistency of the results an extra work term had to be added to the original expression for the first law of thermodynamics . it has been demonstrated that the work density @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the energy density of the universe @xmath14 and the pressure of matter in the universe @xmath15 as @xmath16 using this work function , the dynamical friedman equations could be expressed as @xmath17    it may be noted that the hawking radiation is connected to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this connection is established by modeling the black hole as a @xmath18-dimensional sphere whose radius is related to the schwarzschild radius . the emitted particles from the black hole obey the uncertainty principle , as the hawking radiation is a purely quantum mechanical process .",
    "this fact can be used to derive the thermodynamical properties of the black hole @xcite .",
    "it is known that the temperature of a black hole increases as the size of the black hole decreases .",
    "this temperature tends to infinity as the mass size of the black hole approaches zero , and this in turn leads to a catastrophic evaporation of the black hole .",
    "this is because in string theory it is not possible to probe the spacetime below string length scale , and so string theory comes equipped with a minimum measurable length scale which is the string length scale .",
    "furthermore , the energy required to probe the spacetime below planck length is more than the energy required to form a mini black hole in that region of spacetime",
    ". thus , there are strong indications that there exists a minimum measurable length scale for the spacetime @xcite .",
    "in fact , the existence of a minimum measurable length scale is universal feature of almost all approaches to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the existence of the minimum measurable length scale is not consistent with the usual uncertainty principle .",
    "this is because according to the usual uncertainty principle , it is possible to measure the length to an arbitrary accuracy , if the momentum is not measured .",
    "however , it is possible to generalize the usual uncertainty principal to a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , such that this new uncertainty principle is consistent with the existence of a minimum measurable length .",
    "as the hawking radiation depends on the uncertainty principle , the modification of the usual uncertainty principle to the generalized uncertainty principle , also modifies the thermodynamics of the black holes .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there is no catastrophic evaporation of the black hole in this modified thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this is because a black hole remnant forms in the gup deformed thermodynamics .",
    "thus , the gup prevents the black hole from evaporating completely , just like the standard uncertainty principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing .",
    "in fact , the usual relation between the entropy and the area of a black hole gets significantly modified due to the gup @xcite .",
    "as the friedmann equations are viewed as thermodynamical relations in the jacobson formalism , the modification of the thermodynamics by the gup will also modify the friedmann equations in the jacobson formalism . such modification to the friedmann equations",
    "has been recently studied @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the relation between the area of the apparent horizon and entropy was used for calculating the modification to the friedman equations from the gup .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in these gup modified friedman equations , there exists a maximum energy density close to planck density .",
    "thus , the maximum energy density is reached in a finite time .",
    "this means that in this model there is an absence of the cosmological evolution beyond this point from a spacetime prospective .",
    "in fact , it was demonstrated that the maximum energy density and a general nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the spacial curvature @xmath19 .",
    "this state of maximum energy density was reached in a finite time @xcite .",
    "so , in this model , the big big bang singularity is not accessible , and the energy density in the spacetime can not be extended beyond planck density .",
    "this bound on the energy density of spacetime occurs because of the gup .",
    "as the friedmann equations get modified due to the gup , we expect the inflationary cosmology also to get modified due to the gup in the thermodynamical approach .",
    "so , in this work we will study the inflationary cosmology using the jacobian formalism . we will also study the effect of gup deformed thermodynamics on the inflationary cosmology    it is possible to study the inflationary cosmology by using a potential to derive the properties of the inflationary cosmology .",
    "thus , a specific form of the potential is chosen , and the model of th inflationary cosmology depends on the details of the potential chosen @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible to use the hamilton - jacobi formalism to model the inflationary universe @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the hubble parameter is expressed in term of a scalar field .",
    "it is possible to deducing a form of the potential in the the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to obtain an exact solution for the scalar field in this approach .",
    "thus , we will use the hamilton - jacobi formalism in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in sec .",
    "[ ah ] , we review the derivation of modified friedmann equations due to gup @xcite in the context of the first law of thermodynamics . in sec .",

    "[ t ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we also discuss some possible extensions of this present work in this last section .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the derivation of friedman equations from the first law of thermodynamics relation with the apparent horizon of frw universe with assuming that the entropy is proportional to the area of the apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "we then review briefly the calculations of the impact of gup on friedman equations through this thermodynamic approach @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-dimensional frw universe is represented by the following spacetime metric : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the metric of @xmath24-dimensional sphere , @xmath25 and the spatial curvature constant @xmath19 takes the values @xmath26 for a flat , closed and open universe , respectively .",
    "the apparent horizon is calculated from the relation @xmath27 .",
    "so , its radius can be written as @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter .",
    "we assume that the frw universe is occupied with a perfect fluid .",
    "now we can express the energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the four velocity of the fluid .",
    "the energy conservation law ( @xmath32 ) leads to the continuity equation @xmath33 motivated by the arguments of @xcite , the work density @xmath13 can be defined as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the projection of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 in the normal direction . for our case , the work function",
    "is simplified to be @xmath37 now , we briefly review the derivation of einstein equations in the thermodynamic approach @xcite .",

    "now in the thermodynamical approach the friedmann equation can be calculated from the entropy of the apparent horizon of frw universe .",

    "using phase space method @xcite , it was found that the big bang singularity is not accessible in this description .",
    "this was because the spacetime itself can not be extended beyond planck density as a result of the gup modified thermodynamic approach to gravity .",
    "[ inflationgup ] now we can analyze the inflationary cosmology in the presence of a minimum measurable length . in this",
    "regards , the hamilton - jacobi approach is picked out as an appropriate formalism for studying inflation and its interesting prediction , quantum perturbations .",
    "we set @xmath63 in our case for studying inflation . considering the density given by @xmath64 ,",

    "+ the hamilton - jacobi formalism is utilized as a strong tool to provide numerous inflationary models with exactly known analytic solutions for the background expansion@xcite . in this formalism , instead of",

    "+      the most interesting aspect of the inflationary scenario is that the scenario predicts quantum perturbation in the very early times of the universe evolution .",
    "there are three types of perturbation known as scalar , vector , and tensor perturbations , and the most important ones are scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "scalar fluctuations become seeds for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies or for large scale structure ( lss ) formation . therefore , by measuring the spectra of the cmb anisotropies and density distribution , the corresponding primordial perturbations could be determined . employing the amplitude of scalar perturbations from @xcite , the scalar spectra index",

    "the produced tensor fluctuations induce a curved polarization in the cmb radiation and increase the overall amplitude of their anisotropies at a large scale .",
    "the physics of the early universe could be specified by fitting the analytical results the of cmb and density spectra to corresponding observational data .",
    "by contrast to scalar and vector perturbations , energy - momentum perturbations have no role in tensor perturbation equation . after doing some algebraic analysis , and obtaining the amplitude of tensor perturbations @xcite , the tensor spectra index",
    "is derived as @xcite    @xmath76    the imprint of tensor fluctuations on the cmb bring this idea to indirectly determine its contribution to power spectra by measuring cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "such a contribution could be expressed by the @xmath77 quantity , which is known as tensor - to - scalar ratio and represents the relative amplitude of tensor - to - scalar fluctuations , @xmath78 .",

    "then , the final value of scalar field could be read from eq.([srp ] ) . in order to estimate the field value in the beginning of inflation ,",

    "in addition , the general behavior of the potential sounds to be suitable . at the beginning of inflation , the scalar field ( inflaton ) stands on top of the potential , and it rolls down to the minimum with increasing time , or with reducing scalar field .",
    "then , it is realized that the inflation in this work could be counted as a member of _ `` large field model '' _ class of inflation .",
    "the third part of figures depicts the equation of state parameter in term of scalar field .",

    "this generalization corresponds to the derivation of the expressions for observables in terms of the generalized slow roll parameters . it would be interesting to analyze the models with non - canonical kinetic term in the thermodynamic approach and also analyze the modification to these models that can occur because of the existence of a minimum measurable length scale .",
