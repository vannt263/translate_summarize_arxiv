    "since its inception , understanding the effect of environments on a closed system has been a key subject of thermodynamics . in particular when the system size is reduced to a mesoscopic scale , fluctuations in the system caused by those of the environments play dominant roles in many physical phenomena , such as brownian motion .",
    "the state of brownian objects is typically investigated with the langevin theory in which the environments exert forces on the brownian objects through deterministic linear friction and fluctuating langevin forces @xcite .",
    "this approach has been proven to be very effective in many applications . furthermore , the recent development of stochastic energetics @xcite allows us to investigate the exchange of energy between the brownian objects and the environments within the langevin theory .",
    "when the system is in contact with more than one environments which are not equilibrium with each other , we expect that energy and momentum flows between the system and the environments change in the way that the detailed balance is broken .",
    "rigorously speaking , this loss of detailed balance brings the environments out of equilibrium at least in the vicinity of the system - environment interfaces .",
    "this aspect is not reflected in the langevin description .",
    "consider , for example , cases where a brownian object is simultaneously in contact with two different heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "what force will be exerted on the brownian object by the baths ?",
    "a natural extension to the standard langevin theory is to use the frictions and the stochastic forces from each bath assuming that the fluctuation - dissipation relation of second kind ( i.e. the einstein relation ) holds independently for each bath , the condition which is sometimes called local detailed balance .",
    "while such a simple linear model works well in many cases , there are phenomena that refuse to be understood by the linear langevin approach .",
    "a most striking example is the _",
    "adiabatic piston _ placed between two gases with different temperatures @xcite .",
    "the piston has no internal degree of freedom so that no heat flows between the baths through it .",
    "an interesting question is if the piston moves when the two baths have the same pressure .",
    "naively one may think that the piston does not move because pressure on the both sides of the piston is the same .",
    "it turns out that the laws of thermodynamics alone can not tell whether the piston moves or not @xcite .",
    "feynman @xcite pointed out that the fluctuations of the piston s velocity should be taken into account .",
    "however , the langevin approach with the linear frictions falsely predicts zero mean velocity .",
    "a similar difficulty also appears in some models of brownian motors working between two baths @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the body of brownian objects , e.  g. a triangular body , is not symmetric with respect to space inversion .",
    "this kind of asymmetry is not fully realized in the linear langevin equation since the linear friction constant or tensor is non - polar . in the case of the adiabatic piston ,",
    "the brownian object itself is symmetric but the environments are not . in either case , the linear langevin theory can not take into account asymmetric interactions between the brownian objects and the environments .",
    "a common solution to these problems has been to resort to full and general microscopic descriptions , such as molecular dynamic ( md ) simulation or master - boltzmann equations under pertinent perturbative approximations .",
    "these methods are effective in predicting the outcome . for the adiabatic piston",
    ", the md simulation @xcite and the perturbative master - boltzmann equation @xcite give quite consistent results showing that the piston moves towards the _ hotter _ reservoir .",
    "a more recent investigation based on the nonlinear langevin equation also confirms it @xcite . while we now know that the piston moves , we still do nt fully understand the physics behind it .",
    "recently , we investigated the force exerted by gas particles on a brownian object in a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) and discovered a rather general principle @xcite . when there is energy dissipation , net momentum flux at the surface of a brownian object is reduced from the flux without dissipation , which we shall call _ momentum deficiency due to dissipation _ ( mdd ) . as a consequence the force on the brownian object decreases from the equilibrium force by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is energy dissipation per unit time , and the thermal velocity of the gas particles of mass @xmath2 at temperature @xmath3 is defined by @xmath4 . the boltzmann constant",
    "is denoted with @xmath5 .",
    "the positive prefactor @xmath6 depends on the detail of the system but usually at the order of 1 .    with this new principle , we are able to explain all of the above mentioned phenomena without the lengthy calculation @xcite .",
    "it is this mdd that is what is missing in the linear langevin theory .",
    "the stochastic energetics @xcite tells us that the linear langevin theory is sufficient to obtain the dissipation rate .",
    "therefore , one can evaluate the missing force ( [ eq : main ] ) within the langevin description .",
    "furthermore , we note that this fundamental principle is applicable to systems beyond the regular brownian objects , such as inelastic pistons and granular brownian ratchets @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate the validity of the new principle ( [ eq : main ] ) using hard disk systems including md simulation . in the next section",
    ", we heuristically explain the idea of momentum deficit due to dissipation .",
    "then , we derive explicit expressions of @xmath7 for hard disk systems .",
    "the results are compared with md simulation of shared brownian pistons .",
    "we also derive non - equilibrium forces on an inelastic brownian piston . despite",
    "that the origin of dissipation is quite different from the previous model , we arrive at the same expression , ( [ eq : main ] ) and md simulation confirms it .",
    ". in this case , the momentum flow of the outgoing particles",
    ", @xmath8 equals the momentum flow of the incoming particles @xmath9 .",
    "the sum of the two flows is the pressure of the gas which balances with the external force .",
    "the lower panel ( b ) illustrates a non - equilibrium case where the gas loses energy through the piston to external environments . in this case , the momentum flow of the outgoing particles is smaller than that of the incoming particles , resulting in the reduction of the force exerted on the piston by the gas.,width=302 ]    in this section , we briefly summarize the key concept developed in ref .",
    "first , we consider a simple equilibrium system illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : key - idea](a ) .",
    "the system consists of a two - dimensional cylinder filled with a gas and a piston of mass @xmath10 with surface size @xmath11 , pressed with a constant external force @xmath12 .",
    "the piston is a brownian object and its velocity fluctuates due to the collision with the gas particles .",
    "however , when the piston is in thermal equilibrium , its mean velocity is zero .",
    "hence , the sum of the pre - collisional and post - collisional momentum flows , @xmath13 , is balanced by the external force . here",
    "the summation is taken over all collisions during a unit time .",
    "the detailed balance tells us that at equilibrium the two momentum flows must be equal and therefore , on average , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the pressure of the gas .",
    "note that unlike a simple kinetic theory used in elementary textbooks the individual collisions can transfer energy and momentum between the gas and the piston at the microscopic time scale since the piston is a brownian object .",
    "it is the detailed balance that makes the two momentum flows identical on average .",
    "now we turn to a non - equilibrium case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : key - idea](b ) where energy flows from the gas through the piston into another environment .",
    "we assume that the piston is in a ness so that its mean velocity is zero .",
    "the magnitude of the external force is the same as that in the equilibrium case , i.  e. , @xmath16 . in non - equilibrium cases ,",
    "this relation does not necessarily indicate mechanical equilibrium . even for a non - fluctuating macroscopic object ,",
    "the actual force exerted by the gas deviates from @xmath17 as observed in a radiometer .",
    "our question is what is the actual force on the piston when it is a brownian object .",
    "we expect that the post - collisional speed is smaller than that in the equilibrium case .",
    "hence , the net momentum flow must be reduced .",
    "this is the momentum deficit due to dissipation and the force induced by mdd , @xmath7 , is defined by @xmath18 which vanishes in the absence of dissipation .    the magnitude of @xmath7 can be estimated from the energy balance @xmath19 as a rough estimate , we replace fluctuating quantities with typical values ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of collisions per unit time .",
    "similarly for the outgoing particles , we introduce a typical velocity @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the dissipation is assumed to be so weak that @xmath24 .",
    "then , the balance of momentum and energy are expressed in simpler forms : @xmath25 eliminating the unknown quantity @xmath23 , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) except for the prefactor @xmath6 which is omitted in the above phenomenological argument since it depends on the system configuration .    despite the drastically simple derivation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) agrees with the result of lengthy calculations except for the prefactor . applying this principle we are able to explain the adiabatic piston and other phenomena both conceptually and quantitatively @xcite .",
    "we consider again the ness case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : key - idea](b ) . in order to find explicit expressions",
    "we assume that the gas consists of hard disks which elastically collide with the piston .",
    "the temperature of the gas , @xmath3 , is assumed to be constant and the velocity of the gas particles satisfies the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "we assume only binary hard collisions to take place .",
    "the piston surface is smooth so that the velocity component parallel to the piston remains the same upon the collision .",
    "hereafter , we consider only the velocity component perpendicular to the piston .",
    "momentum and energy conserve at each collision even when the brownian object is simultaneously in contact with other baths or external agents since the hard disk collision is instantaneous . for @xmath26-th collision ,",
    "the gas particle and the piston have the pre - collisional velocity @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively and the corresponding post - collisional velocities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by the momentum and energy conservation laws : @xmath31 between the successive collisions , the piston interacts with another environment or an external agent and its momentum and energy change by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . the change in the piston velocity is determined by another set of momentum and energy balance equations : @xmath34 summing up eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_con ] ) and ( [ eq : p_ext ] ) over all @xmath35 collisions during a unit time , we find the net momentum balance : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and we have used the ness condition @xmath38 .",
    "the mean value is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 indicates average over all collisions during a unit time ( see appendix ) and it is not the same as a regular thermal average over the maxwell distribution .",
    "the force due to mdd is now expressed as @xmath41 similarly , adding up eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_con ] ) along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_ext ] ) leads to net energy balance @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "we have used the steady state condition @xmath44 .    for incoming particles , we find @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see appendix ) .",
    "we do not have exact statistics of the outgoing particles .",
    "however , when the dissipation is weak , we can assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "using this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_disk1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath49 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_disk1 ] ) and ( [ eq : j_disk2 ] ) , we obtain the formula ( [ eq : main ] ) with a prefactor @xmath50 .",
    "now , we introduce a more concrete ness model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) so that we can evaluate the dissipation rate .",
    "the upper cylinder is the same as the basic model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : key - idea](b ) ] and the gas in it has temperature @xmath51 .",
    "a ness condition is generated by linking the piston to another piston in the second cylinder filled with another gas at a different temperature @xmath52 .",
    "these two pistons are rigidly connected and move together . unlike the upper one , the lower cylinder is periodic so that the particle density does not change as the piston moves .",
    "accordingly , when the piston moves , the pressure of the upper gas , @xmath53 changes while the pressure @xmath54 of the lower gas remains constant .    it is known that when @xmath55 , heat flows from the upper gas to the lower gas through the fluctuations of the brownian object @xcite . the heat dissipation through a shared piston",
    "is understood at the level of standard langevin theory @xcite . using the friction coefficients for the upper and lower pistons , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we find the dissipation rate as @xmath58 substituting this dissipation rate and the prefactor @xmath50 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) , we obtain an explicit expression of the force due to mdd : @xmath59    ( a ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the position of the piston and the lower panel the temperature of two gasses .",
    "initially , the two gases have the same temperature @xmath60 . when the temperature of the lower gas is reduced to @xmath61 ,",
    "the upper gas is compressed due to @xmath7 .",
    "the values of the system parameters are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 where the diameter of the gas particle is a unit of the length .",
    "the mean free path in this configuration is about @xmath66 .",
    "the data are averaged over 300 realizations.,width=302 ]    we have checked the above results using hard disk molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the detailed simulation method will be written somewhere else .",
    "initially the system is at a thermal equilibrium with @xmath60 .",
    "the mean position of the piston @xmath67 remains constant since @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : traject ] shows that when the temperature of the lower gas is reduced to @xmath61 , the upper gas is compressed despite the temperature is kept at @xmath69 .",
    "the displacement of the piston indicates that the force exerted on the piston by the gas is _ not _ the pressure times the surface area .",
    "similarly , when @xmath52 is raised above @xmath51 , the upper gas expands .",
    "when the system reaches a ness , the piston is settled at a new position and a new pressure @xmath70 is established .",
    "assuming that the gas obeys the ideal gas law and the displacement @xmath71 is much smaller than @xmath67 , the missing force is estimated by @xmath72 in fig .",
