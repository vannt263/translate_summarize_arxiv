    "recent results from lattice qcd @xcite , corroborated by experimental data from bnl - rhic @xcite , indicate that strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined plasma .",
    "such extreme conditions are believed to have happened in the early universe , and might also be found in the core of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the process of phase conversion during the deconfinement transition can occur in different ways . for a pure gauge @xmath2 theory ,",
    "the trace of the polyakov loop provides a well - defined order parameter @xcite , and one can construct an effective landau - ginzburg field theory based on this quantity @xcite .",
    "the effective potential for @xmath3 has only one minimum , at zero , where the whole system is localized . with the increase of the temperature new minima",
    "appear ( @xmath4 minima for @xmath5 , the center of @xmath2 ) . at the critical temperature , @xmath6 ,",
    "all the minima are degenerate , and above @xmath6 the new minima become the true vacuum states of the theory , so that the system starts to decay . in the case of @xmath1 , whithin a range of temperatures close to @xmath6 there is a small barrier , and the process of phase conversion will be guided by bubble nucleation . for larger @xmath7",
    ", the barrier disappears and the system explodes in the process of spinodal decomposition . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the transition is second - order , and there is never a barrier to overcome .    in this paper , we consider pure @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge theories , without dynamical quarks , that are rapidly driven to very high temperatures , well above @xmath6 , and decay to the deconfined phase via spinodal decomposition .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effect of noise and dissipation on the time scales involved in this `` decay process '' . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt an effective model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the order parameter and the effective potential .",
    "numerical calculations for the evolution of the order parameter are performed on a lattice , using a local langevin equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the effective model for the order parameter . in section iii , we consider the langevin evolution , discussing how to fix the dissipation coefficient from lattice simulations , and present our results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section iv contains our final remarks .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite intends to provide a better representation of lattice results for the gluon plasma equation of state as compared to the usual bag model .",
    "it is obtained combining a few phenomenological inputs with @xmath5 symmetry and some known features of the perturbative equation of state . in particular , in a temperature range going from the deconfinement temperature @xmath8 to @xmath9 the model gives reasonable results and exhibits a thermodynamic behaviour that is coherent with data obtained from lattice simulations .    in this approach , thermodynamic properties are determined by functions of the polyakov loop , defined in euclidean finite temperature gauge theories as @xcite : @xmath10 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes euclidean time ordering , @xmath12 is the gauge coupling constant and @xmath13 is the time component of the vector potential .",
    "we work with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , representing the color degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , we have a @xmath5 symmetry for the case of pure gauge theories that is spontaneously broken .",
    "it would be explicitly broken in the presence of quarks .",
    "working in the imaginary time framework , we have bosonic fields being periodic and fermionic fields being antiperiodic in the imaginary time @xmath14 : @xmath15 any gauge transformation periodic in @xmath14 respects these boundary conditions .",
    "however , as demonstrated by t hooft @xcite , one can consider more general gauge transformations which are only periodic up to the center of the group : @xmath16 .",
    "color adjoint fields are invariant under these transformations , while those in the fundamental representation are not : @xmath17 @xmath18 consequently , pure gauge theories have a global @xmath5 symmetry , which is spoiled by the addition of dynamical quarks .",
    "thus the action is invariant under @xmath5 transformations , but @xmath19 is not .",
    "symmetry requires @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21 .",
    "when the phase transition occurs , the @xmath5 symmetry is spontaneously broken and @xmath22 assumes a non - vanishing value .",
    "so , one can use it as an order parameter for the transition and it is possible to write an effective theory for its dynamics .",
    "the efective theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a mean field treatment in which the polyakov loops are constant throughout the space and the free energy is a function of its eigenvalues .",
    "a perturbative calculation of the free energy of gluons as a function of the polyakov loop eigenvalues yields @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined through the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which reduces to the usual blackbody formula in the case @xmath27 .",
    "this expression for the free energy of gluons propagating in the background of polyakov loops predicts a gas of gluons that is always in the deconfined phase , with no indication that higher - order corrections will modify this result .",
    "this can be modified by the introduction of a mass scale into @xmath28 .",
    "this mass scale will determine the deconfinement temperature @xmath8 and is introduced in a phenomenological way .",
    "one ends up with the same expression of the perturbative calculation , but now @xmath29 . parametrizing the polyakov loop and representing the diagonal matrix as @xmath30 $ ] , it is possible to extract an effective potential as a function of @xmath31 . for @xmath0",
    "one has only @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the effective potential can be written as @xmath34 notice that there is a symmetry @xmath35 associated with the @xmath36 invariance .",
    "it is convenient to write this equation in terms of a new variable @xmath37 to make this symmetry more evident .",
    "one obtains : @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents confinement .",
    "it is interesting to connect the @xmath40 used here and the trace of the polyakov loop , used in ref .",
    "@xcite as the order parameter . for the diagonalyzed matrix we have the trace ,",
    "according to our parametrization , as @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 , or , as defined above , @xmath43 .",
    "so , when @xmath44 we have @xmath45 , which represents confinement , and when @xmath46 , then @xmath47 , representing the deconfined state .",
    "the phase transition in this case is second order , as expected @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath48 can be determined from the deconfinement temperature through the relation @xmath49 , so that it is possible to extract the deconfining temperature from the lattice and then fix @xmath48 .",
    "the minimum of the potential occurs for @xmath50    for @xmath1 there are three eigenvalues : @xmath51 and @xmath33 .",
    "the potential assumes the form : @xmath52 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2tm^2}{3 } + \\frac{tm^2}{2\\pi^2}[2\\phi(\\phi-\\pi)+\\phi(\\phi-2\\pi)]\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , it is useful to rewrite the potential in terms of a new variable @xmath53 , so that one obtains @xmath54 now , @xmath48 and @xmath8 are related as follows : @xmath55 and the minimum is at @xmath56 in this case , @xmath57 and the connection with @xmath40 becomes @xmath58 .     for different values of the temperature.,width=292 ]    immediately above the critical temperature , the @xmath1 potential presents a barrier between the old and the new vacua .",
    "this barrier , however , is very small and quickly disappears with the increasing of the temperature .",
    "one should notice that above @xmath59 the changes in the potential are negligible .",
    "let us now consider the real - time evolution of the order parameter for the breakdown of @xmath5 .",
    "we assume the system to be characterized by a coarse - grained free energy @xmath60 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the effective potential obtained in the last section , and @xmath62 for @xmath0 and @xmath63 for @xmath1 .",
    "the time evolution of the order parameter and its approach to equilibrium will be dictated by the following langevin equation @xmath64 where @xmath12 is the qcd coupling constant , and @xmath65 is the dissipation coefficient , which is usually taken to be a function of temperature only , @xmath66 .",
    "the function @xmath67 is a stochastic noise assumed to be gaussian and white so that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the noise and dissipation terms are originated from thermal and quantum fluctuations resulting either from self - interactions of the polyakov loop field or from the coupling to diferent fields ( such as chiral fields ) .",
    "the case with only first - order time derivative was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this description is admittedly very simplified .",
    "a more complete analysis should consider different contributions of noise and dissipation terms and memory kernels instead of simple markovian terms proportional to the first time derivate of the field @xcite .",
    "in general , one obtains a complicated dissipation kernel that simplifies to a multiplicative dissipation term which depends quadratically on the amplitude of the field as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is determined by imaginary terms of the effective action for @xmath40 and depends weakly ( logaritmically ) on the couplings .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies , then , that the noise term will also contain a multiplicative contribution of the form @xmath72 , and be in general non - markovian .",
    "the white noise limit is reobtained only for very high temperatures .    for the @xmath0 case we have fixed @xmath65 in the following way .",
    "we have used pure - gauge euclidean lattice monte carlo simulations in the line discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    ", spinodal decomposition is obtained on the lattice performing local heat - bath updates of gauge field configurations at @xmath73 , after thermalizing the lattice at @xmath74 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath75 for deconfinement is found to be @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath65 is then extracted by comparing the short - time exponential growth of the correlation function @xmath77 predicted by the lattice simulations @xcite and the langevin description , assuming of course that both dynamics are the same . making this comparison for the lowest lattice momentum mode",
    ", it is found that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a time scale relating monte carlo time and real time . assuming that typical thermalization times are of the order of a few fm / c , we obtain @xmath80  @xmath81 .",

    "( [ eq.1 ] ) on a cubic spacelike lattice with @xmath83 sites under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use a semi - implicit finite - diference scheme for the time evolution and a finite - difference fast fourier transform for the spatial dependence @xcite . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath84mev @xcite and we obtain @xmath85mev .",
    "we took the average of several realizations with random initial configurations around @xmath86 .",
    "we consider the time dependence of the volume average of @xmath40 @xmath87 where @xmath4 is the number of lattice sites in each spatial direction , and @xmath88 are the lattice sites . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot @xmath89 , where @xmath82 is the positive minimum of the bare effective potential , for three situations : no dissipation and no noise ( dotted curve ) , no noise ( dashed curve ) and full solution ( solid curve ) .",
    "when considering noise , we have added the appropriate counterterms to make the equilibrium solution independent of the lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "all curves are for @xmath90 .    clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is the large effect of dissipation , which delays the rapid exponential growth of the order parameter due to spinodal decomposition .",
    "the retardation seen here for the deconfinement transition is substantially larger than the corresponding delay seen for the chiral condensate evolution in ref .",
    "the effect of noise is also in the direction of delaying equilibration , as expected .",
    "also expected , and clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , is the effect of noise in the equilibrium value of @xmath40 which is larger than @xmath91 .",

    "the results of our simulations at @xmath94 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . here",
    "we are using the same lattice and same dissipation @xmath65 as for @xmath0 .",
    "as seen in this figure , the effect of dissipation is even more dramatic than for @xmath0 , with the proviso of course that we are using the value of @xmath65 extracted from @xmath0 lattice simulations .",
    "as mentioned earlier , immediately above the critical temperature the @xmath1 potential presents a barrier between a local minimum and an absolute minimum .",
    "however , this barrier has no effect on the delay seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , since our simulations are done for high temperatures , @xmath95 .",
    "we have not investigated the effect of noise in this case because the appropriate renormalization counter - terms for an effective potential with a first - order transition are not yet available  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effects of dissipation and noise in the deconfinement transition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 pure gauge theories . we have used the effective model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which combines phenomenological inputs with @xmath5 symmetry and some known features of the perturbative equation of state .",
    "the model provides a reasonable representation of lattice results for the pure - gluon plasma equation of state in the temperature range between @xmath6 and @xmath96 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations for the evolution of the order parameter on a spatial cubic lattice using a local langevin equation .",
    "we find that both dissipation and noise have dramatic effects on the spinodal decomposition of the @xmath0 order parameter , delaying considerably its thermalization .",
    "dissipation effects are even larger for @xmath1 .",
    "the present work must be improved in several aspects .",
    "perhaps the most important one is in the method used to extract the dissipation coefficient @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this was done using euclidean lattice monte carlo simulations , in which spinodal decomposition of the order parameter is obtained performing local heat - bath updates of gauge field configurations above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in this approach is the relation between monte carlo updates and real time .",
    "another source of uncertainties comes from a richer structure of noise and dissipation terms , including an evaluation of memory kernels .",
    "it is widely known that , in general , quantum corrections lead to complicated dissipation kernels that only in very special situations simplify to an additive noise term as used here .",
    "these issues will be considered in a future publication @xcite .",
