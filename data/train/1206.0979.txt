    "by : xiao - yong feng , jianhui dai , chung - hou chung , qimiao si      in this supplementary material , we first derive an effective action of the kondo lattice model with soc by taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the slave bosons . we show that while the quantum fluctuations do not affect the kondo insulator ( ki ) phase , they do reduce the bulk gap of the topological insulator ( ti ) phase .",
    "we then consider the effect of the magnetic order of the local spins , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we show that the magnetic order does not change the nature of the ti phase .",
    "the notations here follow those introduced in the main text .",
    "we start from expressing the hamiltonian introduced in the main text in the slave - boson representation , @xmath117 in the above expression , @xmath118 or @xmath39 is the index for sublattices , @xmath53 is introduced to implement the no double occupation of local electrons . in this formulism , the bosons can accommodate zero modes , which are denoted by @xmath119 .",
    "hence a nonvanishing @xmath60 corresponds to the bose - einestein condensation of the slave - bosons .",
    "quantum fluctuations are contributed mainly from the bosons with non - zero @xmath120 .",
    "the effective action @xmath121 for the system , defined by @xmath122 , is then given by @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath124 is the bare action of the itinerant electrons , @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) are the matsubara frequencies for fermions ( bosons ) . after integrating out the fermionic ( grassman ) fields @xmath127 and @xmath128 ,",
    "the effective action becomes @xmath129 we integrate out the bosonic fields and , to order of @xmath130 , obtain the following effective action for the conduction electrons @xmath131}c^{*}_{\\alpha,\\textbf{k}\\sigma}(\\omega)c_{\\alpha,\\textbf{k}\\sigma}(\\omega)+{\\cal o}(v^{4}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now using the identities , @xmath132}&=&\\frac{1}{i\\omega - e_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{i\\omega-\\lambda } - \\frac{1}{i(\\omega+\\omega)-e_0-\\lambda}\\right),\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_{\\omega}\\frac{1}{i\\omega-\\lambda}&=&-n_b(\\lambda)=0,\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_{\\omega}\\frac{1}{i(\\omega+\\omega)-e_0-\\lambda}&=&n_{f}(e_0+\\lambda),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we arrive at the following expression for the effective action @xmath133 where the inverse of the green s function is @xmath134    since the bare energy level of the local @xmath114-electrons @xmath135 is much lower than the fermi energy , the poles of the green s function are essentially determined by the condition @xmath136 when @xmath137 . in this case",
    ", one recovers all the mean - field results as discussed in the main text , where the quasiparticle bands are equivalently given by the poles of the green s function .",
    "the kondo regime where @xmath137 is determined by @xmath78 , with @xmath71 being self - consistently solved by the mean field equations .",
    "quantum fluctuations contributed from the term @xmath138 are negligible .",
    "therefore we conclude that the existence of the ki phase and its properties are robust to the quantum fluctuations of the slave bosons .    on the other hand , when @xmath75 , or @xmath76 , one has @xmath139 , then the poles of the green s function are given by @xmath140\\\\ \\omega_{2",

    "when @xmath93 , one simply recovers the two electron bands decoupled from the local spins , with a direct band gap between @xmath141 and @xmath142 opens at the dirac points , @xmath145 .",
    "when @xmath146 is small , the band structures do not change , while the amplitude of the band gap is given by @xmath147 . therefore",
    ", the hybridization @xmath148 just reduces the bulk gap of the ti phase .",
    "combined with the result shown in fig.3(a ) , our results suggest that the bulk gap decreases continuously when the quantum critical point is approached from either sides .",
    "therefore we argue that quantum fluctuations turn the ti - ki transition into a canonical continuous form , with vanishing gaps from both sides .",
    "we turn consider an antiferromagnetic order of the local spins induced by the rkky interactions .",
    "our main concern here is how such an order , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry , influences the topological order . to address this issue ,",
    "it is adequate to consider the effect of an effective staggered magnetic field associated with the antiferromagnetic order . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the antiferromagnetic order to correspond to the local spins staggered on the sublattices a and b. we use @xmath110 to represent the magnetization of the @xmath114-electrons per site in the even ( or odd ) sublattice , which will induce a conduction - electron polarization by the kondo interaction .",
    "this will add an additional term the effective hamiltonian is : @xmath149 to the total hamiltonian . here , @xmath150 is the rkky interaction @xmath151 , which is small for small hybridization .",
    "we follow the approach similar to what was described above , obtaining the inverse green s function in the ti phase ( @xmath75 ) @xmath152 because in the absence of @xmath153 , @xmath154 is close to 0 at half - filling , it is reasonable to replace @xmath155 by @xmath156 , and when @xmath110 is very small , @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , the poles of the green s function is given by @xmath158 [ -\\omega+\\frac{n_f(-\\sigma i_rm)v^2}{\\omega - e_0}-\\sigma(\\lambda_{k}-j_k m)]=|\\epsilon_{k}|^2.\\ ] ]    obviously , the quasiparticle bands are similar to those of the original ti phase . at the gap position , @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "the effect of the staggered fields ( @xmath161 ) is evident : while @xmath110 simply reduces the energy @xmath162 , it also effectively renormalizes @xmath163 .",
    "they both reduce the direct bulk gap at zero temperature to be @xmath164 $ ] ( at the dirac points ) . because the magnetic order breaks the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) ,",
    "the spin degeneracy of the surface states splits@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the ti with a trs - breaking magnetic field is characterized by the spin chern number@xcite , and the @xmath112 characterization is recovered when @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "hence the ti phase persists when @xmath166 unless the bulk gap @xmath167 closes at certain large and finite hybridization ( and , relatedly , @xmath168 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for small hybridization , the antiferromagnetic order keeps the ki phase intact .",
    "this demonstrates the validity of the main conclusions obtained from the sbmf method .",
    "for sufficient large hybridization ( and , relatedly , @xmath168 ) , however , the system enters the antiferromagnetic phase in which the surface states may be gapped@xcite .",
    "the band structures at that regime are rich but beyond the scope of the present paper ."

    "<S> the regime of transitions among the competing ground states represents a setting in which the effects of strong interactions on ti s may become more tractable . </S>",

    "<S> the result confirms that @xmath108 at half - filling and @xmath109 at 1/4- or 3/4-filling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the insulating phase at 1/4- or 3/4-filling is topologically non - trivial , and its surface states , while having the spin direction locked by the momentum , contain the contributions from both conduction and local electrons . </S>",
    "<S> hence in the case of fig.[spectra](d ) we have a new ti phase with the kondo - singlet formation and a surface heavy - fermion helical liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the ti - ki transition around @xmath71 . in the present analysis at the saddle - point level , the onset of kondo effect is continuous ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ parameter](a ) ) . correspondingly , the ki gap sets in </S>",
    "<S> continuously . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , on the ti side there is simply a decoupling of the conduction - electron and local - moment components . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that the quantum fluctuations beyond the saddle point reduce the bulk gap from the ti side , as is described in some detail in the supplementary materials ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar to the case of single - impurity pseudo - gapped kondo problem , for which numerical renormalization group calculations , for instance , establish a well - defined second - order phase transition for the kondo - destruction quantum critical point @xcite . in the lattice case , the rkky interaction between the local moments , which is mediated by kondo coupling in our model , will also induce magnetic order . taking into account </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order will leave the ki phase intact ; as is standard , the kondo screening present in the ki phase quenches the local moments and their ordering tendency . in the ti phase , we have explicitly shown ( in the sm ) that an antiferromagnetic order , characterized by the order parameter @xmath110 , will reduce the ti bulk gap to @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> this ti gap remains non - zero for a finite range of @xmath110 and @xmath72 ; in other words , the ti phase remains stable in the presence of an antiferromagnetic order for a range of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be understood based on general arguments : in the presence of magnetic order , the @xmath112 topological invariant is replaced by two spin - chern numbers which remain unchanged when the time reversal symmetry is broken by the magnetic order@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the surface states remain gapless unless the bulk gap closes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while a detailed transitions among ki and ti phases on the one hand , and antiferromagnetic order on the other is beyond the scope of the present work , our work does reveal that the heavy - fermion phase diagram contains a hitherto unexplored new regime with a competition among topological , kondo - coherent and magnetic states ; such competition involves the physics of kondo destruction and associated local quantum criticality @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic order and related dynamical effects are incorporated in our analysis , the ti - ki transition discussed here will represent a regime where topological effects strongly interplay with the onset of magnetism and kondo coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the simplification that proximity to quantum criticality brings may very well make the interaction effects on the ti phase and its associated surface states more tractable .    </S>",
    "<S> we close by noting that we have treated the hybridization to be @xmath29-independent . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin- and @xmath113-dependences of the hybridization is incorporated , part of the ki phase may itself become topological , as emphasized by ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly discuss our work in the context of 4@xmath114-electron - based kondo insulators . </S>",
    "<S> in smb@xmath1 , it is known that a sufficiently large external pressure collapses the kondo coherence in smb@xmath1 and turns it into an antiferromagnetic metallic state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the recent experimental evidence in smb@xmath1 for the edge states of a topological insulator @xcite , this is reminiscent of the transition among the topological and kondo coherent / magnetic states implicated by the present study . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing question then arises , which deserves the study of future experiments : what happens to the candidate chiral edge states when smb@xmath1 is placed under external pressure ? along a similar line , cenisn is another intermetallic system believed to be a kondo insulator . in cenisn , </S>",
    "<S> ( negative ) chemical pressure achieved through pd- or pt- substitution for ni is known to induce a transition out of its kondo insulator state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will therefore be informative to explore surface states in the ce(pt@xmath115ni@xmath116)sn and ce(pd@xmath115ni@xmath116)sn series . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth noting that ceptsn has the distinction in that it involves 5@xmath24 electrons with a large soc .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the effect of soc of the conduction electrons in a kondo - lattice system . </S>",
    "<S> our study offers the first qualitative understanding of the competition between topological and kondo insulator ground states on a simple and yet generic model in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> while our analysis has so far been primarily confined to the paramagnetic cases , our results already suggest that the overall phase diagram of heavy - fermion systems includes a new regime with competition among topological , kondo - coherent and magnetic states </S>",
    "<S> . this regime should be particularly prominent for heavy fermion systems whose conduction electron band is associated with the strongly spin - orbit - coupled @xmath0 electrons . as such , our work opens up a new regime of physical interest for compounds based on iridium , platinum and related @xmath0 elements .    </S>",
