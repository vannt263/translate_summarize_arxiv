    "arrays of coupled photonic waveguides have become excellent classical simulators of quantum and relativistic physics ; cf . @xcite and references therein . in particular , they have allowed one of the first visualizations of dirac physics phenomena like zitterbewegung and klein tunneling in tabletop experiments @xcite .",
    "the majorana equation is a lorentz covariant generalization of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "it is the first relativistically invariant theory and the first application of the infinite dimensional representations of the lorentz group @xcite . if supplemented by the majorana condition of charge invariance , i.e. majorana fermions , it is equivalent to the dirac equation . in the standard model",
    "the neutrino is the only candidate to be described by the majorana equation and , for this reason , most interest in its unrestricted version has been purely theoretical . in modern gauge theories ,",
    "chiral spinors answer to two - component majorana equations @xcite .",
    "this has rekindled the interest in majorana dynamics and , recently , it has been proposed both a procedure to implement nonphysical operations related to majorana physics @xcite and a scheme to simulate the majorana equation @xcite with trapped ions setups .",
    "these were the first proposals to bring majorana physics into the quantum optics laboratory up to our knowledge .",
    "here we go beyond the quantum optics realizations and show that it is posible to simulate majorana physics by propagation of classical light in one - dimensional photonic crystals . for this reason we will present the quantum simulation of the majorana equation in 1 + 1 dimension in the following section to provide the basic set of transformations that will move us to / from its classical simulation .",
    "then , we will propose a photonic analogue in the form of two novel one - dimensional photonic crystals that simulate the majorana dynamics via the propagation of two initial light distributions for each one . in our proposal",
    "we use a combination of experimentally demonstrated bichromatic @xcite and glauber - fock @xcite lattices .",
    "this bichromatic - glauber - fock lattice allows us to evade the restriction of staying near the brillouin zone that appears when using bichromatic lattices to classically simulate dirac physics .",
    "our proposal imposes no restriction and manages to classically simulate the evolution of gaussian wavefunctions under dirac dynamics by a single beam of light impinging the first waveguide of the array .",
    "finally , we will show that by exploiting the quantum - classical analogue it is straightforward to construct the impulse functions of our lattices .",
    "one of us has been part of an effort to implement a quantum simulation of the majorana equation in a trapped ion setup @xcite . here , we give a brief summary of the topic in order to provide the basis to construct a classical analogue .",
    "we start from the majorana equation @xcite , @xmath0 where the symbol @xmath1 stands for charge conjugation of the spinor @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the dirac matrices , the symbol @xmath5 is shorthand notation for partial derivation with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the majorana mass and we have set @xmath8 . in 1 + 1 dimensions it is possible to rewrite it as @xmath9 where the symbols @xmath10 with @xmath11 are the pauli matrices , @xmath12 is the dimensionless momentum , @xmath13 stands for the modified majorana mass in units of momentum , and the majorana field is given as a two - dimensional complex vector , @xmath14 .",
    "then , we can combine the field and its charge conjugate , @xmath15 to create and extended real hilbert space where we can write the majorana equation as a schrodinger equation , @xmath16 \\psi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the real four - element field given by @xmath17 which is related to the majorana field via the transformation @xmath18 with @xmath19 where the symbol @xmath20 stands for the unit matrix in dimension two . note that the unitary operation @xmath21 providing the basis @xmath22 , such that we can write the original majorana field as @xmath23 , yields the following schrdinger equation related to the majorana equation : @xmath24 \\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this point , we can propose a form for our four - vector and realize that this schrdinger representation for the majorana equation leads to two uncoupled dirac - like equations with positive and negative mass , @xmath25 \\phi_{\\pm}. \\label{eq : majoranadirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "starting from the separation of the majorana equation into two dirac equations in , we could follow the idea in @xcite and compare the dispersion relation for a bi - chromatic lattice with the energy - momentum dispersion relation of the dirac equation and conclude that the majorana hamiltonian can be simulated classically by two bi - chromatic refractive index lattices described by the differential equation set @xmath29\\mathcal{e}_{j } + \\mathcal{e}_{j+1 } + \\mathcal{e}_{j-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as long as the simulation stays near the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "also , we have introduced a bias refractive index @xmath30 that only introduces an overall phase factor .",
    "we do nt want such a strong restriction between the momentum of the simulated wave - packet and the characteristics of the bi - chromatic lattice . in order",
    "to get rid of this restraint , we map the adimensional linear momentum operator to a combination of bosonic creation ( annihilation ) , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , operators , @xmath33 then , we can rewrite the two uncoupled dirac equations that quantum simulate the majorana equation as a schrdinger equation with effective hamiltonians : @xmath34 after a @xmath35 rotation around the @xmath36-axis , @xmath37 providing a new basis @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "it is straightforward to notice that is equivalent to the rabi hamiltonian @xcite with null field frequency .",
    "thus , we can setup a photonic lattice analogue following previous work on the classical simulation of the rabi hamiltonian @xcite . in summary , if we split the corresponding hilbert space into two parity subspaces given by @xmath40 we can write the evolution of any given initial state @xmath41 , where the first subindex is related to the positive / negative mass hamiltonian and the second to the positive / negative parity , as the vector differential set @xmath42 where the vector of amplitudes is given by @xmath43 and the elements of the four matrices describing the dynamics reduce to two matrices as @xmath44 by making the change @xmath45 we obtain , up to a constant phase factor , a differential set describing two photonic lattices where the individual refractive indices are bi - chromatic @xcite and the nearest neighbour couplings go as those in glauber - fock photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that the magnitude of the effective mass @xmath13 will provide three dynamics regimes : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    before advancing further ,",
    "we want to discuss the meaning of light impinging the @xmath49th waveguide in one of our photonic lattices which , after dropping two of the subsindices refering to the parity and the mass sign , is equivalent to writing @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the @xmath30th hermite polynomial . in other words ,",
    "a beam of light impinging just the first waveguide of the array is equivalent to an initial gaussian wavefunction in dimensionless canonical space , @xmath53 .",
    "light impinging just the @xmath49th waveguide will simulate an initial wavefunction in canonical space with a @xmath49th hermite - gaussian distribution .",
    "any given initial wavefunction in dimensionless canonical space , @xmath54 , can be constructed from an adequate superposition of classical fields impinging the photonic crystal , @xmath55 where the initial field amplitudes at each waveguide , @xmath56 , correspond to the decomposition of the initial wavefunction in the orthonormal basis provided by ( [ eq : onbase ] ) , @xmath57 note that this has to be done for each set of initial conditions to be propagated in each photonic crystal .",
