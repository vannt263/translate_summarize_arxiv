    "in the past few years , considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the nature of high redshift galaxies , driven mostly by the availability of large samples that have been photometrically selected using rest - frame uv spectral features .",
    "the largest existing sample at present is at @xmath8 , where it is efficient to use ground - based imaging through optical filters designed to isolate the lyman limit spectral discontinuity at 912   in the rest - frame , and where the spectroscopic follow - up has proved to be straightforward because many important spectral features are well - placed at wavelengths where optical spectrographs are most sensitive ( steidel _ et al . _  1996a ,",

    "very deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging such as that provided by the hubble deep fields has also proved to be very effective , using similar techniques for @xmath15 ( steidel _ et al . _  1996b ,",

    "lowenthal _ et al . _",
    "the hst data reach much deeper into the high redshift galaxy uv luminosity function , but are confined to very small areas on the sky ; as such , the ground - based and space - based surveys have been largely complementary ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1999 ) .    to date ,",
    "most of the work on these high redshift galaxy samples has focused on the large - scale clustering properties of the galaxies ( e.g. , adelberger _ et al . _  1998 , giavalisco _ et al . _",
    "1998 , steidel _ et al . _",
    "1998 , giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ) , on the properties of individual galaxies as deduced from their spectra ( e.g. , pettini _ et al . _",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2001 ) , or on inferences concerning the universal star - formation history as deduced from the global uv luminosity density ( e.g. , madau _ et al . _",

    "meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 , adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "the strong clustering of the bright lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) has generally been interpreted as indirect evidence that the observed galaxies reside in relatively massive dark matter halos , but how these galaxies are linked to present - day galaxies is far from clear , and has been quite controversial . while considerable , the directly - observed uv luminosity of lbgs is clearly very significantly modified by extinction ( see adelberger & steidel 2000 , hereafter as2000 , for an extensive discussion of this topic ) , and at best provides information on the instantaneous formation rate of o and b stars .    while the far - uv properties of the lbgs are the most straightforward to study observationally , it is also of interest to explore additional properties of these galaxies that require longer wavelength observations , to be used in concert with the existing far - uv measurements .",
    "for example , one would like to determine the distribution of rest - frame optical luminosities , and the star - formation histories , ages , dust content , and stellar masses all necessary for understanding the range of objects selected with the typical lyman break photometric criteria , and the relationship of these objects to galaxies in the lower redshift universe . indeed , different models provide quite divergent descriptions of the nature and fate of the objects which are identified as lbgs . according to one model , the galaxies selected as lbgs are bright in the rest - frame uv because they are experiencing merger - induced starburst events .",
    "the intense starburst events occur on relatively short timescales ( less than 100 myr ) , and produce 10 - 100 times less stellar mass than what is seen in a typical @xmath16 galaxy .",
    "such low - mass bursting objects would then be the precursors of local low - mass spheroids , unless they merge with similar objects to form more massive systems ( lowenthal _ et al . _",
    "1997 ; sawicki & yee 1998 ; somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , lbgs are the central objects in relatively massive dark matter halos , which form stars steadily but relatively quiescently over longer than 1 gyr timescales , accumulate @xmath17 by @xmath0 , and evolve eventually into the ellipticals and spiral galaxies at the bright end of the local luminosity function ( steidel _ et al . _  1996a",
    "; baugh _ et al . _  1998",
    "it is not possible to determine the nature of lbg stellar populations and thereby distinguish between the above scenarios with only optical observations probing the rest - frame uv .",
    "both an aging stellar population and increasing dust extinction result in redder rest - frame uv colors , so that the effects of age and dust are degenerate without longer wavelength data .",
    "recent studies ( sawicki & yee 1998 ; dickinson 2000 ; papovich , dickinson , & ferguson 2001 ) have shown that the addition of near - ir photometric measurements at rest wavelengths longer than the location of an age - sensitive spectral break at @xmath18 removes some of the degeneracy between dust and age in the modeling of lbg stellar populations . here",
    "we present the results of a moderately large near - ir survey of optically selected lbgs , designed to determine the distribution of rest - frame optical luminosities of lbgs , and , where possible , information about their star - formation histories . in  2 , we present the details of the optical and near - ir observations and data reduction .  3 summarizes the distribution of optical - ir colors of lbgs . in  4 , we describe the derivation of the lbg rest - frame optical luminosity function , and compare it to local galaxy luminosity functions .",
    " 5 presents the procedure and results of population synthesis modeling of the lbg spectral energy distributions between 900   and 5500    in the rest - frame , using the measured optical / ir colors .",
    "extensions of the model results to rest - frame uv spectroscopy are discussed in  6 , and an evolutionary sequence for lbgs is proposed in  7 .",
    "our general conclusions are summarized in  8 .",
    "optical images were obtained for all the fields included here as part of our extensive survey for @xmath8 galaxies ; the field centers are given in table 1 .",
    "the optical imaging data were collected during the interval 1995 - 1998 at the william herschel telescope ( 3c 324 , b2 0902 + 34 , and cdfa ) , the palomar 200 inch hale telescope ( cdfa , dsf2237a , dsf2237b , hdf , q0201 , q0256 , ssa22a , and ssa22b ) , and the kitt peak mayall 4 meter telescope ( westphal ) .",

    "objects bright in @xmath4 were preferentially selected for near - ir imaging , as can be seen by the relative distributions of @xmath4 apparent magnitude in the near - ir sample and that in our @xmath8 sample as a whole ( figure 1a ) .",
    "we deliberately selected objects whose rest - uv - inferred extinction properties ( see steidel _ et al . _",
    "1999 and as2000 for a discussion ) spanned the entire range seen in the full lbg survey , from zero to several magnitudes of extinction in the rest - frame uv . within the lbg @xmath8 selection function ,",

    "there are spectroscopic redshifts for about 75% of the full @xmath5 sample .",
    "we observed at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , using the standard @xmath3 and @xmath2 filters . using integration times of @xmath36 seconds @xmath37 and @xmath38 seconds @xmath39 per exposure , we dithered the telescope between exposures to form a 9-point box pattern on the sky , each box position separated by a few arcseconds . in most cases , we aimed to complete 6 or more sets of the 9-point dither pattern for each nirc pointing . during the dither pattern",

    "the data were reduced using standard procedures with the aid of the dimsum package . on clear nights , we determined the photometric zeropoints for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 bandpasses with observations of faint ( 11th - 12th magnitude ) near - infrared standard stars from the list of persson _ et al . _  ( 1998 ) . during 5 of our 9 nirc runs , we experienced stable , photometric conditions , while the remaining 4 runs contained variable cirrus . on runs with variable conditions",

    "prior to the measurement of optical / near - ir colors , each nirc frame was smoothed with a gaussian to match the image quality in the corresponding optical images , which generally had @xmath42 .",

    "; steidel & hamilton 1993 ) . in brief , using a modified version of the focas ( valdes 1982 ) image detection and analysis routines , a catalog of isophotal and `` total '' object detections was generated in the @xmath43 ( where `` total '' refers to the focas definition , which is the flux measured within an aperture grown to twice the area of the initial detection isophote ) .",

    "artificial galaxies , with a reasonable range of intrinsic sizes and with @xmath4 magnitudes and @xmath5 colors drawn randomly from the observed range of both quantities , were added to the images after convolution with the seeing disk .",
    "we then produced detection catalogs in @xmath4 and measured the @xmath5 colors with matched apertures in the @xmath2 image .",
    "the process of adding fake galaxy sets ( the number of galaxies added in a given trial was kept small enough so as not to alter the systematics of the observed data frames ) and recovering the magnitudes and colors using the same procedures used for the real data was repeated until enough detections were obtained to study the scatter between true and recovered @xmath5 color as a function of recovered @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the monte - carlo generated photometric uncertainties are significantly larger than those that would result from the application of simple poisson counting statistics that neglect systematics .",
    "the detections of artificial objects were binned in 0.5 mag steps in measured @xmath4 magnitude and 0.2 mag steps in measured @xmath5 color .",
    "the mean and standard deviation were then computed for the distribution of @xmath51 in each @xmath52 bin . in general",
    "we did not find a significant systematic offset between the measured and true colors , so the color uncertainties are treated as symmetric .",
    "accordingly , we adopted the standard deviation of the @xmath53 distribution as the @xmath54 color uncertainty , @xmath55 for each @xmath52 bin .",
    "to be conservative , we initially treated each nirc pointing independently for the estimation of photometric uncertainties in order to explore possible variations due to slightly different depths , seeing conditions , and sky background .",
    "we subsequently determined that the trend of @xmath55 with @xmath52 was similar enough in all @xmath2 nirc pointings that we simply combined the simulation results from all pointings to calculate an average trend of @xmath55 with @xmath52 for our entire @xmath5 sample .",
    "uncertainties were then assigned to the measured @xmath56 colors in the nirc sample , based on the magnitude and color of each object .",
    "an identical procedure was used to generate uncertainties in the @xmath44 colors of all of the observed galaxies .",
    "the @xmath27 uncertainties were computed from a separate , but similar , set of monte carlo simulations ( adelberger 2001 ) .",
    "all the color uncertainties are listed along with the optical / ir photometry in table 3 .",
    "the distribution of measured optical - ir colors for the 118 galaxies with nirc @xmath2 data is shown in figure 3 .",
    "107 of these measurements are @xmath2 detections significant at the @xmath57 level , while 11 of them are only upper - limits , whose @xmath58 limits correspond to the typical @xmath59 detection limit of @xmath60 in our images .",
    "we find a mean @xmath58 color of @xmath61 and a standard deviation @xmath62 .",
    "of these 118 galaxies , 81 have measured redshifts , with a mean of @xmath63 .",
    "there are @xmath3 band measurements for 63 of the galaxies in the @xmath56 sample .",
    "the mean @xmath64 color is @xmath65 with @xmath66 . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 filters correspond to @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in the rest - frame , respectively , whereas the optical passbands @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath4 sample the galaxies at rest - frame @xmath69 900 , 1200 , and 1700  , respectively .",
    "clearly , there is a wide range of optical / near - ir color among the rest - uv selected @xmath8 lbgs ; the bluest galaxies in @xmath5 have colors that are essentially flat in @xmath47 units from the far - uv to the optical in the rest - frame , whereas the reddest lbgs approach the colors of `` extremely red objects '' .",
    "the typical @xmath58 color of @xmath8 lbgs is more than 2.5 magnitudes redder than that expected for an unreddened instantaneous burst of star - formation at the mean redshift of our sample ( @xmath58 = 0.30 ) , but is significantly bluer than most galaxies in the present - day universe ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "unfortunately , in the absence of high quality spectra covering the same large wavelength range , the interpretation of the colors of lbgs in the context of understanding their stellar populations and extinction must rely heavily on models . in  5 , we use the full set of optical - ir colors ( @xmath70 ) of lbgs in the nirc sample in an attempt to disentangle the degenerate effects of dust and age on lbg broadband spectral energy distributions .",
    "the distribution of redshifts and observed @xmath4 and @xmath71 magnitudes have been used to construct rest - frame far - uv luminosity functions for lbgs at @xmath8 and @xmath72 respectively ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) . with near - ir @xmath2 magnitudes and optical - ir @xmath58 colors for a sample of 118 lbgs",
    ", we have the necessary information to construct the rest - frame _ optical _ luminosity function of @xmath8 lbgs , which is much more easily compared with galaxies in the present - day universe .",
    "optical emission is much less attenuated than far - uv light by the presence of dust , and expected to be less directly linked to the instantaneous star - formation rate , as the stars giving rise to the optical emission sample a larger swath of the main sequence and include stars with longer lifetimes than the o / b stars producing the far - uv light .",
    "thus , one might hope that the optical luminosities provide more information on the integrated stellar populations of the lbgs than can be obtained from far - uv measurements .    at @xmath73 , the mean redshift of the lbg spectroscopic sample ( and of the nirc sample as well ) ,",
    "the @xmath2-band central wavelength of @xmath74 is quite a good match to the central wavelength of the standard @xmath7 optical filter .",
    "while the nirc sample contains galaxies with a range of redshifts , the @xmath2-band central wavelength falls within the rest - wavelength range @xmath75 for the bulk of the sample .",
    "furthermore , the `` photometric depth '' of the lbg redshift selection function corresponds to a difference in absolute magnitude of only @xmath76 magnitudes for a given apparent magnitude ; consequently , given our typical measurement uncertainties , we view it as a reasonable approximation for this analysis to treat all the galaxies in the nirc sample as if they were located at the mean redshift of the entire lbg spectroscopic sample .",
    "this of course allows us to use the whole nirc sample , and not just the objects with spectroscopic redshifts , for the luminosity function analysis .",
    "two pieces of information are required to construct the rest - frame optical luminosity function for lbgs at @xmath8 : the lbg rest - frame uv luminosity function ( i.e. the distribution of @xmath4 apparent magnitudes ) , and the lbg distribution of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath4 magnitude for the nirc sample .",
    "the best - fit @xmath4 apparent magnitude luminosity function parameters for lbgs ( uncorrected for the effects of dust extinction ) are a faint - end slope of @xmath77 , a characteristic apparent magnitude of @xmath78 , and an overall normalization of @xmath79 ( as2000 ) .. ] in  3 , we presented the overall distribution of @xmath58 colors for the nirc sample .",
    "a correlation with @xmath80 confidence ( better than @xmath81 ) is detected between @xmath58 color and @xmath4 magnitude , such that fainter galaxies have redder @xmath58 colors ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this correlation probability was computed including the 11 upper limits in the sample of 118 galaxies with @xmath56 measurements , so the result should not be biased by our typical detection limit of @xmath60 .",
    "the trend of @xmath5 with @xmath4 is included in the luminosity function analysis by using the relationship implied by the best - fit regression slope to the correlation : @xmath82 .",
    "there is a lot of scatter around this regression slope , but it provides a means of encoding the trend between the two variables .",
    "we generated a large sample ( 15000 ) of lbg @xmath4 apparent magnitudes between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , by randomly drawing luminosities from the lbg @xmath8 rest - frame uv luminosity function placed at z=2.972 , the mean redshift of the current @xmath0 lbg spectroscopic sample .",
    "an @xmath58 color was then assigned to each of the @xmath4 magnitudes , drawn randomly from the distribution of @xmath58 colors for galaxies in the nirc sample with @xmath85 , and then shifted by the amount , @xmath86 , according to the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the fiducial @xmath87 distribution was restricted to @xmath88 because this @xmath89 magnitude range contained the largest number of @xmath58 measurements ( 36 ) .",
    "also , the @xmath58 measurements for @xmath88 were virtually all detections , rather than mixture of upper limits and detections . combining",
    "each randomly generated pair of @xmath4 and @xmath58 measurements , we obtained an ensemble of @xmath2 magnitudes , which were grouped into 0.5 magnitude bins .    to determine how the photometric uncertainties of both the @xmath4 magnitudes and @xmath58 colors translated into uncertainties in the derived @xmath2 luminosity function",
    ", the procedure of generating an ensemble of random ( @xmath4 , @xmath58 ) pairs was repeated a large number ( 10000 ) of times . in each trial , we perturbed the sample of actual ( @xmath4 , @xmath58 ) measurements by random amounts consistent with the photometric uncertainties . in so doing , we assumed that the errors in @xmath4 and @xmath56 were uncorrelated , which is a valid approximation since the error in @xmath56 for galaxies in our sample is dominated by the @xmath2 photometric error . due to the slight differences in the sample of @xmath4 magnitudes drawn from the lbg @xmath4 apparent luminosity function , and the more significant differences of the perturbed ( @xmath4 , @xmath58 ) measurements ,",
    "a different @xmath2 distribution was produced in each trial .",
    "the analytic schechter function ( 1976 ) was fit to each perturbed distribution of @xmath2-band apparent magnitudes .",
    "we restricted the fitted region to span only @xmath90 , reflecting the @xmath2 range for which we have actual measurements .",
    "the average number from all the trials was adopted for each 0.5 @xmath2 magnitude bin , and the adopted @xmath91 uncertainty was the standard deviation among the realizations ( which does not include the uncertainties in the lbg @xmath4-band luminosity function best - fit parameters ( as2000 ) ) .",
    "the schechter function was then fit to the average luminosity function values .",
    "the best - fit parameters we obtain are an overall normalization of @xmath92 , a faint end slope of @xmath93 , and a characteristic apparent magnitude of @xmath94 .",
    "the uncertainties on the fitted parameters represent the confidence intervals generated by fitting the schechter function to each perturbed @xmath2 distribution . since it was assumed that all the galaxies comprising the @xmath2 luminosity function were at the mean redshift of the lbg spectroscopic sample , it is straightforward to convert the distribution of @xmath2 apparent magnitudes into a @xmath95 ( i.e. rest - frame @xmath7-band ) absolute magnitude distribution . with",
    "our adopted @xmath96 cosmology , @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath98 .",
    "the overall shape of the rest - frame optical luminosity function is determined by the way in which the @xmath56 distribution as a function of @xmath4 magnitude redistributes @xmath4 magnitudes into @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "accordingly , the faint end slope of the lbg rest - frame optical luminosity function is steeper than that of the uv luminosity function , due to the positive correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath56 .",
    "figure 5 shows the apparent @xmath2 luminosity function ( and the absolute optical magnitudes to which it corresponds ) , as well as the confidence intervals on the best - fit schechter luminosity function parameters . immediately apparent from figure 5",
    "is the fact that the well - constrained bright end of the lbg luminosity function greatly exceeds locally determined optical luminosity functions .    to calculate the rest - frame optical co - moving luminosity density for lbgs brighter than @xmath99",
    ", we integrate over the luminosity - weighted luminosity function in the appropriate magnitude range to obtain @xmath100hz@xmath101 .",
    "we use the @xmath7-band absolute magnitude of the sun , @xmath102 ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) , to express this quantity in solar units : @xmath103 . if the luminosity function were integrated to @xmath104 , the derived luminosity density would be more than 2 times larger than the value determined down to the typical survey detection limit of @xmath99 .",
    "however , such an extrapolation depends sensitively on the value of the faint end slope of the luminosity function , which is poorly constrained by our observed sample .",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 summarize recent local determinations of the @xmath105-band luminosity density , most of which are in the range @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the lbg @xmath7-band optical luminosity density down to only @xmath99 is within a factor of 2 of local measurements of the @xmath105-band optical luminosity density , which were obtained by integrating over the entire @xmath105-band luminosity function .",
    "the optical luminosity function of local galaxies has been computed from numerous surveys over the past thirty years .",
    "some recent determinations from magnitude limited redshift surveys include the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xmath107 luminosity function ( folkes _ et al . _  1999",
    ") , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) @xmath108-band luminosity function ( lin _ et al . _  1996",
    ") , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminosity functions in five optical bands ( blanton _ et al . _",
    "these local optical luminosity functions have much shallower faint end slopes @xmath109 , fainter characteristic luminosities @xmath110 , and higher overall normalizations @xmath111 than the rest - frame optical luminosity function of lbgs . to demonstrate these differences , we plot the 2dfgrs @xmath107 luminosity function in figure 5 along with the lbg rest - frame optical luminosity function .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the 2dfgrs luminosity function are @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 . for a direct comparison with the lbg luminosity function , which specifically probes the rest - frame @xmath7 band ,",
    "the 2dfgrs luminosity function has been shifted 0.5 magnitudes brighter ( i.e. @xmath115 ) , reflecting the typical @xmath116 color of local galaxies .    at the brightest absolute magnitudes ,",
    "where the lbg @xmath7-band luminosity function is well - constrained by our observations , the @xmath8 lbg @xmath7-band luminosity function greatly exceeds the local function , and has a different shape . for this reason , we caution against over - interpreting the differences in the best - fit schechter function parameters relative to other luminosity functions ; for example , the very steep faint end slope , very bright value of @xmath117 , and relatively low value of @xmath118 may well result from fitting the function over a small range of luminosity that does not actually extend as faint as the true `` knee '' in the luminosity distribution . in practice",
    ", it will be extremely difficult to extend this distribution to much fainter near - ir magnitudes from the ground , but it should be quite possible from space .",
    "the obvious implication of the bright end of the @xmath7-band luminosity function of lbgs is that the mass - to - light ratio @xmath119 of lbgs must be very different from that of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "since the co - moving optical luminosity density in the @xmath8 universe is evidently as large or larger than that in the @xmath120 universe despite the fact that most of the stars observed in the local universe probably formed after @xmath0 , the @xmath7 band light at @xmath8 is apparently dominated by relatively massive stars associated with greatly enhanced current star - formation rates , and carries little information about total stellar mass .",

    "the degeneracy results from the fact that , at @xmath8 , commonly used optical filters probe a short - wavelength region of the rest - frame spectrum which does not contain any age - sensitive features that can be easily recognized from broad - band photometry .",

    "the balmer break feature , which is is age sensitive over star - formation timescales of @xmath133 myr@xmath134 gyr , can not be described equally well by any combination of stellar population aging and dust - content .",
    "longer wavelength photometry which includes the discontinuity can in principle be used to break the degeneracy between model fits .",
    "the balmer break feature in galaxy spectra is due to the stellar bound - free absorption coefficient , which has a sharp edge at @xmath132 , ( the wavelength of the @xmath135 transition in neutral hydrogen ) , causing photons with wavelengths shortward of the edge to be absorbed much more efficiently than those with longer wavelengths .",
    "the prominence of this feature in a stellar spectrum depends on the temperature and gravity of the stellar atmosphere , which determines the form of hydrogen that is prevalent in the stellar atmosphere , and therefore which component of the total stellar absorption coefficient is dominant . in cooler late - type stars ( such as f , g , and k ) , @xmath136 opacity dominates the total absorption coefficient , and the balmer decrement is not very pronounced . in the early - type massive o and b stars the high temperatures result in the increased ionization of hydrogen , so",

    "the balmer break is most prominent in a - stars with temperatures around @xmath137 ( gray 1976 ) .    at the onset of star - formation",
    ", a galaxy spectrum is dominated in the rest - frame uv and blue by the most - massive ( o and b ) stars , most of which have lifetimes shorter than 10 myr . in a continuous star - formation model , after roughly 10 myr , the rate at which o stars are being formed balances the rate at which they are dying , and the number of o stars levels off to a constant value ( leitherer _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) . meanwhile , the lifetimes of less massive a stars range from several hundred myr to 1 gyr",
    "therefore , as the o star population levels off , the number of a stars continues to increase . at the age where the increasing number of a stars relative to the constant number of o stars causes the galaxy spectrum at @xmath138 to be dominated by an a - star spectrum",
    ", we start to see an increasing balmer break in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "after 100 myr the magnitude difference on either side of the balmer break in an unreddened galaxy model is 0.3 mag , and by 1 gyr , the break has increased to a 0.6 magnitudes .",
    "thus , the strength of the balmer break can be used as a rough guide to the duration of the current episode of star - formation on timescales @xmath139 .",
    "the details will depend on the star - formation history ( e.g. , whether the star - formation rate ( sfr ) is an increasing , or declining , function of time ) , the shape of the initial mass function , and the metallicity of the stellar population . because the balmer break even at its strongest is a relatively subtle spectral feature , and because only broad - band photometry is available for the galaxies , a measurement of the balmer break strength requires removing the effects of continuum reddening .",
    "this requirement introduces some covariance into the simultaneous estimates of extinction and the age of the star - formation episode ; we discuss this covariance extensively in  5.3.2 .        in order to examine the range of stellar population properties present in the nirc sample of lbgs",

    "star - formation histories with star - formation rates that are _ increasing _ functions of time pose even more significant problems for the models ; for example , papovich _ et al .",

    "if we neglect the @xmath201 color , and fit @xmath44 and @xmath5 alone , the best - fit models predict more than 7 magnitudes of extinction in the rest - frame uv and would significantly under - predict the rest - frame far - uv fluxes .",
    "the very red optical - ir colors of these galaxies may indicate a problem with the calzetti extinction law in cases where dust extinction is very extreme . in these cases , as in the case of local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , the details of the geometry and distribution of the dust relative to where star - formation is occurring become more important and the simple recipe for extinction breaks down ( trentham , kormendy , and sanders 1999 ; meurer and seibert 2001 ) .",
    "for example , based on the @xmath27 color alone , we would infer a moderate to low amount of dust extinction in md81 ( which may still be true ) .",
    "but such a small amount of extinction , with any age or star - formation history considered in this work , can not account for the very red @xmath44 and @xmath56 colors of md81 .",
    "alternatively , the inability to model these unusual galaxies might be due to the over - simplified nature of the star - formation histories considered .      using the sample of 74 galaxies for which acceptable bc96 continuous star - formation fits were obtained , we explore the trends present among observed and modeled quantities .",
    "these galaxies , all of which have redshifts , are brighter by an average of @xmath202 magnitudes in @xmath4 than the nirc lbg sample as a whole , and brighter by @xmath203 mag than the larger optical lbg photometric sample .",
    "it should be emphasized that the sample of hdf - n lbgs recently analyzed by papovich _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) includes only four ( of 33 ) galaxies brighter than @xmath16 in the rest - frame uv lbg luminosity function , whereas @xmath204% of the galaxies in the sample analyzed here are brighter than @xmath16 .",
    "differences between the two samples might then be ascribed to uv - luminosity - dependent effects , although we see only subtle trends with uv luminosity within our full ground - based sample spanning a factor of @xmath205 in uv luminosity .",
    "steidel _ et al . _  1999 and as2000",
    "have computed the distribution of lbg @xmath154 values based on igm - absorption - corrected @xmath27 colors alone , assuming a fixed intrinsic stellar population that corresponds to a bc96 continuous star - formation model with @xmath206 . with the addition of near - ir data ,",
    "we have been able to model the extinction and variations in the stellar populations simultaneously .",
    "the inferred distribution of reddening , assuming the starburst attenuation relation of calzetti ( 1997 ) and a suite of bc96 continuous star - formation models , has a median @xmath207 , corresponding to @xmath208 magnitudes , similar to the median extinction presented in the earlier works .",
    "this reflects the fact that the previously - assumed galaxy sed is a reasonable approximation for the bulk of the sample in the rest - frame uv , and that most of the information on reddening comes from the far - uv data points even for a relatively `` gray '' extinction law .",
    "the median age for our sample is @xmath209 .",
    "more than @xmath210 of the galaxies have @xmath211 , while @xmath212 have @xmath213 .",
    "there were nine galaxies with formal best - fit @xmath170 values smaller than @xmath214 .",
    "such small ages are not physically plausible for episodes of star - formation , given the dynamical timescales of the star - forming regions ( see  7 ) .",
    "furthermore , the conversion between extinction - corrected uv luminosity and star - formation rate becomes highly non - linear at ages shorter than @xmath214 . on these grounds",
    ", we restricted the best - fit constant - star - formation @xmath170 parameter space to ages of at least @xmath214 , which still provides acceptable fits for the nine youngest galaxies .",
    "we also applied the constraint that best - fit @xmath170 values could not be older than the age of the universe at @xmath0 ( assuming an @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 cosmology ) , which affected the fits for seven galaxies whose formal best - fit @xmath170 values were then too old .",
    "these galaxies , however , all had colors which were statistically consistent with being younger than the age of the universe at @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed in  5.2.3 , the @xmath170 values for the nirc lbg sample are affected in a systematic way by varying the star - formation history or the population synthesis models , but the sample as a whole should broadly represent the significant range in these parameters spanned by the lbgs at @xmath8 .",
    "we have noted that the distribution of @xmath170 values does not reflect corrections to the @xmath58 color for nebular line emission for the @xmath148 of the galaxies in the nirc lbg sample which are at high enough redshift that the @xmath2 measurement could be affected .",
    "however , there is no apparent systematic offset towards higher @xmath170 values for the higher - redshift portion of the sample as might be expected if the higher redshift objects were significantly biased due to nebular line contamination .",
    "histograms of best - fit @xmath170 and @xmath154 are shown in figure 10a .",
    "the median derived star - formation rate for the sample is @xmath218 , and the distribution of values is quite broad , ranging from @xmath219 to as high as @xmath220 .",
    "multiplying the best - fit @xmath170 and @xmath175 yields a distribution of @xmath174 , with a median of @xmath221 , smaller but comparable to the present - day @xmath16 stellar mass , @xmath222 ( cole _ et al . _  2000",
    "; papovich _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) . however , we find that about @xmath223 of the sample have @xmath174 smaller than @xmath224 ( roughly the same sample with best - fit @xmath225 ) .",
    "histograms of the inferred @xmath174 and @xmath175 distributions are shown in figure 10b .",
    "as mentioned above , a similar modeling technique for extracting physical parameters from observed colors of lbgs was used in recent work by papovich _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) ; their sample of 33 galaxies in the hdf - n is a superset of earlier work by sawicki & yee ( 1998 ) on 17 hdf - n galaxies .",
    "the papovich _",
    "et al . _",
    "hdf study , while containing all of the sawicki & yee galaxies , finds somewhat different results from sawicki & yee , including lower typical extinction factors , older ages , and larger formed stellar masses .",
    "the authors attribute some of these differences to their higher - quality hst nicmos @xmath3 and @xmath226 data ( compared to the sawicki & yee ground - based @xmath3 and @xmath226 ) , more accurate matching of optical and infrared photometry to compute colors , and larger galaxy sample . here and above we have focused primarily on the more recent hdf - n analysis of papovich _ et al . _  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the main difference between our modeling procedure and that of papovich _ et al . _",
    "is that the latter work allowed @xmath169 , the exponential star - formation decay time constant , to vary as a free parameter in fitting the models . as discussed above",
    ", there were few cases in which our data could discriminate between different values of @xmath169 that were significant compared to the inferred value of @xmath170 .",
    "however , a direct comparison of the model results is possible for 19 of the 33 galaxies in the papovich _",
    "et al . _",
    "work because the best - fit @xmath169 values are either longer than or much shorter than the inferred @xmath170 , so that the star - formation history is essentially indistinguishable from a constant star - formation model .",
    "for these 19 hdf - n galaxies , the median inferred age is @xmath227 , and the median @xmath228 .",
    "the median @xmath170 is thus higher , while similar , to the nirc lbg median @xmath170 , and the median @xmath154 is slightly smaller than that of the nirc lbg sample .",
    "the remaining 14 hdf - n galaxies have best - fit @xmath229 , and @xmath170 values which are systematically lower than the @xmath230 sample . however , the @xmath169 values for these galaxies are not very well constrained , and larger @xmath169 values also provide acceptable fits .",
    "the older @xmath170 values resulting from larger @xmath169 parameters would be roughly consistent with the @xmath170 values for the other 19 galaxies .",
    "thus , given the uncertainties , it is probably fair to compare broadly the whole papovich _",
    "_  sample to the nirc - lbg sample .",
    "our results are consistent with the inferred parameters for the small subset of the brightest hdf galaxies , including two galaxies in common between the two samples ( see table 3 ) . generally speaking",
    ", the uv - brighter nirc lbg sample has a higher proportion of objects with large inferred extinction and with large values of the inferred stellar mass ( these are generally distinct sets of objects , as discussed further below ) , both of which may be due to the different range of uv luminosity spanned within the two samples .      using observed optical and far - infrared ( fir ) data , as2000 and meurer _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1999 ) demonstrated that at both low and high redshifts , there appears to be a correlation between dust - obscuration and bolometric luminosity ( @xmath231.5ex@xmath232 ) .",
    "the results of our modeling of the lbg seds support the assertion that more heavily obscured galaxies have larger bolometric luminosities ; however , because many of our assumptions are similar most notably , the adopted starburst attenuation relation , our new results can not be taken as independent evidence . as in as2000 , we find that the rest - frame uv luminosity is uncorrelated with the inferred value of @xmath154 , so that applying the inferred extinction correction naturally results in a strong correlation between bolometric luminosity and extinction .",
    "as emphasized by as2000 , inferences about extinction in the high redshift galaxies are very difficult to test observationally , but the trends are very similar to what is observed for star - forming galaxies in the local universe and , so far , the starburst attenuation relation is consistent with available cross - checks at high redshift .",
    "we note in passing that internally consistent application of the inferred extinction corrections to the rest - frame optical luminosities results in a similar correlation of dust obscuration and optical luminosity , and a net correction to the @xmath7-band luminosity density of a factor of @xmath233 compared to the uncorrected numbers presented in  4 .",
    "the correlations of the uv and optical luminosities with best - fit @xmath154 are shown in figure 11 for bc96 continuous star - formation models .",
    "these correlations hold for the all of the star - formation histories used in this work to model the galaxy colors , and would hold for any assumed extinction relation that is correlated with rest - uv color .      in figure 12",
    "we plot the best - fit @xmath154 and @xmath170 parameters for the 74 galaxies successfully fit with bc96 constant - star - formation models .",
    "there is a very strong anti - correlation between @xmath154 and @xmath170 in the sense that younger galaxies are more heavily extinguished than older galaxies .",
    "given the strong correlation between @xmath175 and @xmath154 discussed in  5.3.1 , the relationship between extinction and age translates into a link between age and star - formation rate , where the youngest galaxies also have the highest star - formation rates .",
    "the correlation in the sample between @xmath154 and @xmath170 falls roughly in the same direction as the observed covariance of the ( @xmath234 ) parameters for each individual galaxy .",
    "the covariance of @xmath154 and @xmath170 is dominated in most cases by response of the fitted parameters to perturbations in the @xmath27 color . typically , a positive perturbation to the @xmath27 results in a _ positive _ perturbation to the best - fit @xmath154 and a _ negative _ perturbation to the best - fit @xmath170 , the latter due to the effect of the extinction estimate on the predicted @xmath235 color for a given @xmath170 .",
    "the covariance of the two parameters is clearly demonstrated by the nirc lbg confidence regions shown in figure 8b .",
    "given the strong covariance between best - fit @xmath154 and @xmath170 parameters inherent in the modeling procedure , further tests are necessary to evaluate whether the trend of increasing extinction with decreasing @xmath170 is significant .",
    "in other words , does the apparent correlation arise solely due to objects covariant confidence regions in @xmath196 space , because measurement errors can scatter intrinsically uncorrelated points along the same direction as an @xmath196 correlation ? in order to test the strength of such an apparent correlation , we constructed a sample of 74 uncorrelated @xmath154 and @xmath170 pairs ( to match the size of the observed sample of 74 galaxies ) .",
    "this sample was generated by randomly selecting @xmath154 and @xmath170 values independently from the _ intrinsic _ marginal distributions of each of the parameters .",
    "these _ intrinsic _ marginal distributions were estimated by assuming that the _ observed _ marginal distributions ( shown in figure 10a ) represented the _ intrinsic _ marginal distributions broadened by photometric measurement errors .",
    "in addition to @xmath154 and @xmath170 , @xmath4 apparent magnitude and @xmath236 were randomly selected from the observed distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath236 for nirc lbgs , in order to compute the colors that would be observed from a galaxy with the randomly selected @xmath154 and @xmath170 parameters .",
    "a fake galaxy was retained only if its @xmath154 and @xmath170 parameters implied a @xmath27 color satisfying the lbg selection criterion of @xmath237 , and a @xmath2 magnitude brighter than the typical nirc lbg detection limit of @xmath60 .",
    "photometric uncertainties were assigned to each fake galaxy s predicted set of colors , based on the galaxy s @xmath4 magnitude and colors , and the previously determined functions of @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "the sample of fake galaxies was then `` observed '' a large number ( 1000 ) of times . each time , the colors of the fake galaxies were perturbed in a manner consistent with their photometric errors ( a process similar to the one used to construct the confidence intervals for the 74 real observed galaxies ) .",
    "the result of observing the fake galaxies numerous times with measurement errors was a large distribution of best - fit @xmath154 and @xmath170 values ( the number of fake galaxies ( 74 ) multiplied by the number of trials ( 1000 ) ) .",
    "the marginal distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath170 for this large simulated distribution matched the observed marginal distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath170 in figure 10a  which verifies that our estimate of the intrinsic marginal distribution was reasonable .",
    "we then randomly selected a large number of groups of 74 best - fit @xmath196 pairs from the sample of 74,000 `` observed '' galaxies , and computed the correlation coefficient between @xmath154 and @xmath170 for each randomly selected sample .",
    "in 1000 random samples of 74 fake best - fit @xmath196 values , _ no _ sample had a correlation coefficient as strong as the one seen in the real sample .",
    "it appears that the age / extinction correlation for nirc lbgs has less than a @xmath241 chance of being the result of correlated measurement errors alone . _",
    "a related question is whether the detection limits and selection criteria for the sample could have created an apparent dearth of young , unreddened galaxies , and old , dusty galaxies , which would mimic a real correlation between @xmath154 and @xmath170 . for the redshift range of the sample , the bc96 constant star - formation models with @xmath242 and @xmath243 have @xmath244 within the range for lbgs ( @xmath245 ) , but also very blue @xmath5 colors ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "a detection limit in @xmath2 translates into a limit in @xmath5 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "however , since there are @xmath5 limits rather than detections for only @xmath247 out of @xmath248 galaxies with redshifts in the nirc sample , we conclude that our @xmath2 detection limit has not prevented us from detecting a significant population of young , unreddened galaxies . at any redshift in the nirc sample , old and reddened galaxies , with @xmath249 and @xmath250 , have predicted @xmath251 , which means that all such galaxies with @xmath252 , should be detected in @xmath56 . at the median redshift of the nirc sample ,",
    "the lbg selection limit of @xmath253 implies that we should be able to detect old galaxies with @xmath254 , which is more than one standard deviation to the red of the mean of the sample . at increasing redshift , the upper limit on @xmath154 decreases until at the highest redshift in the nirc sample , @xmath255",
    ", it is only possible to select a 1 gyr model with @xmath256 as a lbg , based on @xmath27 .",
    "such a redshift dependent effect discriminates against old and very dusty objects at the high redshift end of the lbg redshift selection function . to test the significance of such an effect",
    ", the sample of 74 galaxies was divided into low and high redshift subsamples , using the median redshift as a discriminator .",
    "all of the galaxies in the low redshift sample have @xmath257 , at which redshift a @xmath258 stellar population could be detected with @xmath259 .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath154 is barely restricted for the low redshift sample , a strong correlation between @xmath154 and @xmath170 is recovered from this sample , as well as from the high redshift and total samples .",
    "we conclude that the redshift - dependent bias against detecting old and dusty galaxies can not account for the strong correlation found between @xmath154 and @xmath170 in the nirc sample either .",
    "the inferred strong correlation between star - formation age and extinction does depend on the details of the attenuation law applied to correct observed galaxy colors and magnitudes to their intrinsic , unobscured values . at low redshift ,",
    "relatively `` gray '' starburst galaxy attenuation relations such as that of calzetti ( 1997 ) provide a much better predictor of bolometric luminosity from far - uv observations than the reddening curves derived from observations of single stars , such as the smc , lmc , and galactic reddening curves ( meurer _ et al . _",
    "there are very few observations to constrain the nature of dust extinction in galaxies at high redshift ; however , the limited information which exists favors the starburst attenuation relation over a much steeper curve such as the smc law ( meurer _ et al . _  1999 ,",

    "the ratio between smc and calzetti @xmath170 values increases as a function of increasing extinction , but the median ratio is 3.7 .",
    "qualitatively , the larger smc @xmath170 values result from interpreting a larger fraction of the @xmath5 color as due to the balmer break ( aging stellar population ) , and a smaller fraction as due to the effects of dust extinction .",
    "larger when using the smc rather than calzetti law . ]",
    "the result of using the smc law is that the correlation between inferred extinction and inferred age is very much diminished .",
    "the formed stellar mass , @xmath174 , for the constant star - formation models is simply the product of the best - fit @xmath170 and @xmath175 .",
    "figure 13 shows the relationship between @xmath174 and observed and intrinsic ( extinction - corrected ) luminosity values .",
    "when the sample is restricted to galaxies with best - fit @xmath261 ( the median for nirc lbgs ) , there are significant correlations between both uv and optical extinction - corrected luminosities and @xmath174 . however , when the whole nirc lbg sample is considered , the extinction - corrected uv and optical luminosities are only weakly correlated with @xmath174 , indicating that , for the wide range of extinction and age parameters found in the nirc lbg sample , even rest - frame optical luminosities ( the longest accessible wavelengths for @xmath8 galaxies until the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) flies ) often have more to do with current star - formation rates than with formed stellar masses . thus , as emphasized by papovich",
    "_ et al . _  ( 2001 ) , the estimates of the formed stellar mass associated with the most recent star - formation episode must rely on the imf - dependent population synthesis modeling until longer wavelength observations are possible .",

    "_  also explored the dependence of inferred @xmath174 on the modeling assumptions for a given observed galaxy sed , concluding that , while variation of the modeling parameters yields highly variable results for parameters such as age and extinction , the combination of best - fit pairs of these parameters generally results in much more tightly constrained @xmath174 estimates for the modeled star formation episode .",
    "while exploring a smaller volume of parameter space , we confirm this trend for the formed stellar mass values ( cf .",
    " 5.2.3 ) .",
    "our results should be compared directly with the solar metallicity , salpeter imf models of papovich _ et al . _  ( 2001 ) ( their figure 17 ) , where the characteristic formed stellar mass is @xmath262 a few @xmath263 m@xmath264 for objects with uv luminosities of @xmath265 in the far - uv luminosity function of steidel _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) . our nirc sample , which has a median luminosity of somewhat brighter than @xmath265 , has a median inferred stellar mass of @xmath266 m@xmath264 using the @xmath217 cosmology adopted by papovich _ et al .",
    "thus , in the small region of overlap , the ground - based sample yields results similar to the brightest hdf - n galaxies .",
    "in contrast to papovich _",
    "_  , who found that the uv luminosity was well correlated with the inferred stellar mass , we find that the uv luminosity is uncorrelated with the inferred @xmath174 .",
    "this may reflect a real difference between the brighter and fainter samples .",
    "one possible explanation could be that we see a wider range of extinction among the nirc lbgs than is found at fainter uv luminosities ( e.g. , objects of a given uv luminosity can be either heavily extinguished very luminous objects , or modestly extinguished , much less luminous objects ) such that the relationship between uv luminosities uncorrected and corrected for extinction is much less tight ( see as2000 ) . because of the very small overlap in uv luminosity between the two samples , the differences are at present statistically insignificant .",
    "there are 9 objects from the nirc sample which also have nebular line width measurements from near - ir spectroscopy ( pettini _ et al . _  2001",
    "we use the nebular line widths and the measured near - ir half - light radii to compute the dynamical mass enclosed within the half - light radius .",
    "the mass inferred from the nebular line widths is probably not indicative of the total mass in the dark - matter halo containing the lbg , but is likely to represent a lower limit ( see pettini _ et al . _  2001 ) .",
    "similarly , since the inferred stellar mass estimates are only sensitive to the most recent episode of star - formation , they should also represent lower limits on the total stellar mass present .",
    "however , the near - infrared spectroscopic and photometric measurements generally span the same physical region , which contains not only stellar mass , but also gas and dark matter",
    ". the spectroscopic line widths should be sensitive to all this matter , while the photometry only probes the luminous stellar matter .",
    "therefore , the mass inferred from the nebular line widths should represent a rough upper limit to the @xmath174 values derived from the bc96 model fits .",
    "we would suspect a problem in the population synthesis modeling technique if the derived @xmath174 values were much larger and statistically discrepant with the inferred dynamical masses . as shown in figure 14 , for the majority of the galaxies ,",
    "the @xmath174 value is consistent with the inferred dynamical mass ; in two cases where it is not , the best - fit stellar mass is significantly smaller than the inferred dynamical mass .",
    "we refrain from drawing conclusions from figure 14 , given the very large uncertainties in both mass estimates , but there is no evidence that the two mass scales are wildly inconsistent with one another .",
    "one of the more striking results from the modeling of lbg stellar populations is the strong correlation between extinction and age , such that the galaxies best fit by younger stellar populations are also best described by larger amounts of extinction and reddening . as discussed in  5.3.2",
    ", we believe that this correlation is significant , despite the tendency for the individual ( @xmath234 ) covariance intervals to lie in a similar direction to the observed sample correlation , and despite a @xmath27 selection criterion which prevents a galaxy older than @xmath258 with significant amounts of dust extinction from being classified as a lbg at the highest redshifts in the sample . assuming that the correlation is real , there are implications for interpreting the range of lbg best - fit stellar populations and extinction parameters .",
    "it appears that the distributions of lbg star - formation ages , extinction , and inferred stellar masses fall along a continuum in the parameter space , the extremes of which might be viewed as separate `` populations '' . to illustrate this point",

    ", b , 1998 , 1999 ) . by combining individual rest - frame uv spectra of galaxies in the `` young '' and `` old '' subsamples described above , we constructed `` young '' and `` old '' composite spectra following a method similar to that described in steidel , pettini , & adelberger ( 2001 ) .",
    "the young and old composite spectra are plotted in figure 15 , and figure 16 shows an expanded view of four specific regions of the spectra for more detailed comparison .",
    "there are several clear differences to note , the most dramatic of which is in the relative lyman @xmath141 line profiles .",
    "the old spectrum has strong lyman @xmath141 emission with rest - frame @xmath276 , whereas the young spectrum has a broad absorption trough plus much weaker emission which combine to give roughly @xmath277 .",
    "the radiative transfer of lyman @xmath141 photons in galaxies is a complex process which depends not only on the amount of dust present in the ism but also , and perhaps more importantly , on the geometry and kinematics of the neutral interstellar hydrogen gas ( charlot & fall , 1993 ; chen & neufeld 1994 ; kunth _ et al . _",
    "1999 ; tenorio - tagle _ et al . _",
    "however , due to resonant scattering , lyman @xmath141 photons will on average traverse a much longer path before escaping the galaxy than nearby continuum photons , so that they are more prone to absorption by dust in the ism .",
    "therefore , the amount of dust present in the ism should have a non - negligible effect on the emergent lyman @xmath141 profile .",
    "the fact that the composite `` young '' spectrum exhibits a lyman @xmath141 profile with a combination of absorption and only weak emission , while the composite `` old '' spectrum has very strong lyman @xmath141 emission , offers independent support for a scenario in which the youngest galaxies have significantly dustier interstellar media than more mature lbgs .",
    "additionally , the young spectrum has much stronger lyman @xmath278 absorption , stronger low - ionization interstellar metal absorption lines of si ii @xmath279 , c ii @xmath280 , fe ii @xmath281 , and a stronger p - cygni c iv @xmath282 profile .",
    "the only interstellar metal absorption line which is stronger in the old spectrum is al ii @xmath283 .",
    "while the s / n ratios of the composite spectra represent large improvements over that of the individual spectra , the significance of the differences in line strengths between the old and young spectra is still difficult to quantify , given the noise in the composite spectra and the relatively small sample of objects whose spectra were combined .",
    "we therefore choose to make more qualitative observations .",
    "the low - ionization interstellar absorption lines are probably optically thick , and therefore on the flat part of the curve of growth , where equivalent width is determined mainly by velocity width , and not column density ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "1996a , gonzalez delgado _ et al . _  1998 ,",
    "heckman & leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "accordingly , the stronger interstellar absorption lines in the young spectrum may indicate interstellar medium velocity widths larger than those in the old spectrum .",
    "larger velocity widths are consistent with a scenario in which a higher supernova rate ( based on the higher @xmath175 ) deposits larger amounts of mechanical energy into the ism , accelerating the interstellar gas to higher velocities .",
    "a picture begins to emerge from the range of stellar populations observed in the nirc lbg sample . at one extreme of the continuum , there is a group of galaxies with best - fit ages younger than or equal to the dynamical timescale associated with the luminous portions of lbgs .",
    "based on nirc and hst - wfpc2 observations , the typical lbg angular half - light radius is @xmath284 ( giavalisco _ et al . _  1996",
    "; pettini _ et al . _",
    "this angular size translates into @xmath285 kpc at @xmath286 .",
    "furthermore , from near - ir spectroscopic measurements of a sample of 15 lbgs , the typical nebular line widths are @xmath287 km  s@xmath10(pettini _ et al . _  2001 ) .",
    "the associated dynamical timescale is @xmath288 . with typical values for @xmath289 and @xmath21 ,",
    "this calculation yields @xmath290 myr .",
    "a starburst can not occur on timescales shorter than the dynamical timescale of the region experiencing star - formation , for reasons of causality .",
    "since a constant star - formation model with an age less than or equal to the dynamical timescale is indistinguishable from a bursting mode with a decay time , @xmath169 , limited to be greater than or equal to the dynamical timescale , the young , dusty galaxies in the nirc lbg sample might well be described as galaxies undergoing bursts of star - formation .",
    "whatever the cause of the burst of star - formation , we see intense star - formation and enhanced dust extinction in the youngest galaxies . at the other extreme",
    "are the galaxies whose best - fit constant star - formation @xmath170 values are close to a hubble time at @xmath0 , whose dust extinction is only moderate , and whose star - formation rates are more quiescent .",
    "the nirc lbg sample also contains galaxies with ages , dust - extinction , and star - formation rates which are intermediate between these two extremes .    since the range of nirc lbg stellar populations is controlled by two strong correlations one between dust and age , and another between dust and intrinsic star - formation rate we use these correlations to construct a unified evolutionary model for lbgs at high redshift . according to this model ,",
    "the `` young '' and `` old '' samples discussed in this section constitute different evolutionary stages of the same population , which are both selected as lbgs .",
    "the `` young '' galaxies represent objects in the first stage , where the star - formation rate is very active ( @xmath291 ) , large amounts of dust obscure the sites of star - formation , and a stellar mass on the order of @xmath292 is formed in a dynamical timescale . as time passes , dust is either destroyed or blown out , ( or both ) , resulting in lower extinction , and the star - formation rate decays on a @xmath293 myr timescale to reach the more quiescent rates seen in the `` old '' sample ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "the `` old '' sample then represents the most advanced stage of the evolution which we observe in @xmath0 lbgs , by which stage a stellar mass of @xmath295 has formed .",
    "as discussed earlier , for most `` old '' lbgs , it is not possible to distinguish from a strong balmer break whether constant star - formation has continued for at least 1 gyr , or whether exponentially declining star - formation has continued well past the age of the time constant , @xmath169 . if the relatively quiescent star - formation rates of the old galaxies are extrapolated back to the ages of the young / dusty sample assuming an exponentially declining star - formation rate with a time constant on the order of the dynamical timescale for lbgs , the star - formation rates obtained are on the order of the active rates in the young - dusty sample .",
    "such a simple evolutionary picture for lbgs is qualitatively consistent with the strong correlations we see in the nirc lbg stellar population parameters .",
    "this evolutionary picture predicts a relatively flat distribution of @xmath170 values , which is broadly consistent with the observed @xmath170 histogram ( figure 10a ) except for the smallest @xmath170 bin , which is `` over - sampled '' in the nirc lbg data set by about a factor of two (  2.2 ) . while correcting the youngest bin by this amount makes the @xmath170 distribution flatter , the youngest bin still contains more galaxies than the other bins , implying that some fraction of the young , dusty , actively star - forming galaxies may fade to star - formation rates which are too low to be detected with the ( ground - based ) lbg criteria .",
    "there are several interesting issues which accompany the above scenario .",
    "first , there is the question of what process produces the initial , rapid star - formation phase .",
    "some obvious possibilities are major or minor merger events ( e.g. , somerville _ et al . _  2001",
    "; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , or even the initial collapse of the baryonic component of the galaxy .",
    "second , there is the question of how the large amount of dust in the significantly reddened `` young '' galaxies forms , given the relatively short timescales implied by the ages of these galaxies how much of the dust is formed in the current star - formation episode , and how much originated in previous generations of stars ?",
    "another important issue is the process by which dust is depleted as `` young '' lbgs evolve into `` old '' galaxies .",
    "there are a few proposed mechanisms for the removal of dust from galaxies .",
    "the first is radiation pressure , by which dust grains ( especially larger ones @xmath296 in size ) can be expelled by the general radiation field of a galaxy",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) have numerically modeled the removal of dust from a present - day @xmath16 spiral galaxy by radiation pressure , and have shown that up to @xmath177 of the dust formed in such a galaxy may be ejected from the disk . while the relevant physical conditions might not be identical in local spiral galaxies and the high redshift lbgs , radiation pressure provides one viable mechanism by which dust can be removed from galaxies . perhaps more relevant to the conditions in lbgs is the observational evidence for galactic - scale outflows , so - called `` superwinds , '' in actively star - forming local galaxies .",
    "these outflows are due to the combined mechanical energy input from supernovae and winds from massive stars , which sweeps up interstellar material and accelerates it to speeds of several hundred @xmath297 or greater ( heckman _ et al . _  1990 ,",
    "et al . _  2000",
    "there is strong kinematic evidence for such outflows in lbgs at high - redshift as well ( franx _ et al . _  1997",
    "; steidel _ et al . _  1998",
    "; pettini _ et al . _",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "relative to the nebular emission lines representing the systemic velocity of the galaxy , low - ionization interstellar absorption lines in lbg rest - frame uv spectra are blue - shifted by @xmath298 , and lyman-@xmath141 emission is redshifted by @xmath299 ( pettini _ et al . _",
    "the implied typical outflow velocities are @xmath300 km  s@xmath10 , and in the best studied case ( pettini _ et al . _  2000",
    ") the implied mass outflow rate equals or exceeds the current star - formation rate ( similar to what is seen in local starburst galaxies e.g. martin 1999 ) .",
    "recently , there has been direct observational evidence that dust , as well as gas , has been swept up by starburst superwinds and is contained in the material outflowing from local starburst galaxies ( heckman _ et al . _  2000 ; alton , davies , & bianchi 1999 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) determine a typical outflowing dust mass of @xmath301 with a typical dust outflow rate of @xmath302 for the starbursts in their sample .",
    "while there are no direct observations of dust in lbg outflows , the presence of dust in the ism of lbgs is required by their broad - band colors .",
    "it seems very reasonable that the dust in the ism of lbgs becomes entrained in the outflows implied by the kinematics of uv interstellar and nebular spectral features .",
    "the process of dust being expelled in superwinds from starburst galaxies at high redshift is qualitatively consistent with the observed trend between extinction and star - formation age in lbgs .",
    "indeed , the superwind phenomenon has important implications not only for the enrichment of the intergalactic medium , but also for the evolution of dust opacity in galaxies .",
    "we have presented the results of a near - ir survey of optically selected @xmath0 lbgs .",
    "the survey includes 118 galaxies with @xmath2 measurements , 63 of which also have @xmath3 measurements .",
    "we combined the new near - ir data with previously obtained optical data to compute the distributions of optical - ir colors of lbgs .",
    "we have used the photometric data , spanning typical rest - frame wavelengths of 9005500  to obtain the following results :    \\1 . the rest - frame optical luminosity function of uv - selected lbgs greatly exceeds locally determined luminosity functions at the bright end . a schechter function",
    "fit formally yields a very steep ( @xmath303 ) faint - end slope , but part of this could be due to the fact that at our detection limit of @xmath99 ( @xmath304 at @xmath8 ) the data do not extend significantly beyond the knee in the luminosity function and the overall shape of the luminosity distribution is quite different from the local functions .",
    "independent of the fitted parameters , the @xmath0 optical luminosity function has a large excess of luminous galaxies relative to locally determined luminosity functions . down to our detection limit of @xmath305 ( or a luminosity equivalent to @xmath306 in the present - day @xmath7-band luminosity function )",
    ", the rest - frame optical co - moving luminosity density of lbgs ( uncorrected for dust extinction ) is @xmath307 .",
    "this value is already within a factor of 2 of values determined by integrating local luminosity functions down to arbitrarily small luminosities .",
    "thus , the optical light from lbgs at @xmath8 likely exceeds that produced by all stars in the local universe .",
    "we have modeled the stellar populations and extinction of the lbgs with both spectroscopic redshifts and near - ir measurements ( 81 galaxies ) using relatively simple prescriptions .",
    "most of the galaxies have star - formation histories , star - formation rates , and star - formation ages that are only weakly constrained by the photometric observations without limiting parameter space using external constraints on the assumed extinction law and relatively simple forms for the star - formation history .",
    "we have chosen to report the results assuming the solar - metallicity bruzual and charlot ( 1996 ) models , a salpeter imf , the calzetti ( 1997 ) starburst attenuation relation , and a constant star - formation history .",
    "the systematic effects of changing the any of these assumptions have been summarized .",
    "when the interpretation of lbg stellar populations is restricted to bc96 constant star - formation models , we find a large spread of inferred ages , ranging from several myr to more than 1 gyr .",
    "the median best - fit constant star - formation age is @xmath209 . in model - independent terms",
    ", the distribution of best - fit ages indicates that a significant fraction of lbgs have been forming stars on timescales long enough that a detectable balmer break exists in their spectral energy distributions .",
    "although the specific age assigned to the balmer break depends on the star - formation history used to fit the colors , we note that very recent work indicates that winds from lbgs similar to those modeled above have shock - heated the intergalactic medium on physical scales of @xmath308 kpc ( adelberger _ et al . _  2001 , in preparation",
    "such a large sphere of influence , with typical outflow velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath10 , suggests star - formation timescales of at least a few hundred million years for typical lbgs .",
    "this constitutes completely independent support for the timescales resulting from the stellar population modeling presented in this work .",
    "the bc96 constant star - formation distribution of best - fit @xmath154 ranges from @xmath309 with a median of 0.155 .",
    "this distribution depends less on star - formation history than the distribution of best - fit ages .",
    "the median implied extinction for this sample corresponds to a factor of @xmath310 attenuation in the rest - frame uv ( 1600  ) and a factor of @xmath1552 in the rest - frame optical .",
    "derived from the distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath170 , the best - fit star - formation rate , @xmath175 , ranges from @xmath311 , with a median of @xmath312 .",
    "the distribution of formed stellar masses , @xmath174 , ranges over more than 2 orders of magnitude with a median of @xmath313 .",
    "we note that the above parameter distributions and median values may not be completely general to lbgs at @xmath314 , since the way in which the nirc lbgs were selected tended to enhance the number of young , dusty , intensely star - forming , low @xmath174 objects , relative to the full lbg sample .",
    "regardless of the star - formation history used in this work to model the colors of the nirc lbgs , we find a strong correlation between dust extinction and intrinsic luminosity , such that dustier galaxies are intrinsically more luminous .",
    "this correlation has been reported by other authors ( as2000 ; meurer _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) , but here the extinction estimates are supported by observations over a wider wavelength baseline , spanning on average from @xmath315 in the rest - frame .",
    "this dependence of extinction on luminosity is consistent with a similar relation seen for star - forming galaxies in the local universe , and has the implication that , for the range of galaxies which we select as lbgs , those which are more heavily obscured by dust are as easy to detect in the rest - frame uv and optical as galaxies which are less dusty , because they are also intrinsically more luminous .",
    "\\5 . for most galaxies",
    ", we find that the formed stellar mass derived from the integral of the best - fit star - formation rate over time depends relatively weakly on the star - formation history applied to fit the observed colors ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "regardless of star - formation history , the inferred formed stellar mass is only weakly correlated with extinction corrected uv and optical luminosities for our total ground - based sample .",
    "this fact , together with the results on the rest - frame optical luminosity function of lbgs , shows that even at observed wavelengths of 2.15 @xmath122 m , the luminosities are poor proxies for stellar mass in general .",
    "therefore , inferences on stellar mass from optical / near - ir photometry are highly imf - dependent and will apply only to the stars that have formed in the last several hundred myr prior to observation .",
    "longer - wavelength observations with sirtf should improve the situation considerably .",
    "we find a strong correlation between inferred star - formation age and extinction in lbgs , such that younger galaxies are dustier than older galaxies , and have higher star - formation rates .",
    "establishing the significance of this correlation is difficult because of the covariance of @xmath154 and @xmath170 in our fits , but we have been unable to reproduce a similarly strong observed correlation from any intrinsically uncorrelated distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath170 .",
    "the correlation might be made to vanish with a suitable choice of star - formation histories or dust attenuation curve ( i.e. smc ) , but its existence appears secure for the most plausible choices of both .",
    "we also present evidence that this correlation is not an artifact of either the lbg @xmath27 selection criteria , or of the typical detection limit of @xmath99 for the nirc observations .",
    "composite rest - frame uv spectra of `` young '' and `` old '' subsamples of nirc lbgs exhibit differences , most dramatically in their respective lyman-@xmath141 profiles , offering independent evidence that the youngest galaxies have more dust extinction and/or more active interstellar media .",
    "we interpret the dust - age correlation in the context of a unified picture of lbgs in which the younger , dustier , more actively star - forming galaxies evolve into the older , less reddened , and more quiescent galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the dust extinction towards lower values is probably governed by the outflow of dust which is entrained in a `` superwind '' powered by the energy from supernovae explosions and the winds from massive stars .",
    "objects at various points along this evolutionary sequence are identified by the lbg optical selection criteria .",
    "the timescale for the evolution of the young - dusty galaxies into the older - less - reddened galaxies is on the order of @xmath316 , while the more quiescent phase can last a gyr or more .",

    "<S> we present the results of a near - infrared imaging survey of @xmath0 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers a total of 30 arcmin@xmath1 and includes 118 photometrically selected lbgs with @xmath2 band measurements , 63 of which also have @xmath3 band measurements , and 81 of which have spectroscopic redshifts . using the distribution of optical @xmath4 magnitudes from previous work and @xmath5 colors for this sub - sample , we compute the rest - frame optical luminosity function of lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> this luminosity function is described by an analytic schechter fit with a very steep faint end slope of @xmath6 , and it strikingly exceeds locally determined optical luminosity functions at brighter magnitudes , where it is fairly well constrained . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-band luminosity density of only the observed bright end of the @xmath8 lbg luminosity function already approaches that of all stars in the local universe .    </S>",
    "<S> for the 81 galaxies with measured redshifts , we investigate the range of lbg stellar populations implied by the photometry which generally spans the range 9005500   in the rest - frame . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters under consideration are the star - formation rate as a function of time , the time since the onset of star - formation , and the degree of reddening and extinction by dust . while there are only weak constraints on the parameters for most of the individual galaxies , there are strong trends in the sample as a whole . with a wider wavelength baseline than most previous studies at similar redshifts </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm the trend that intrinsically more luminous galaxies are dustier . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that there is a strong correlation between extinction and the age of the star - formation episode , in the sense that younger galaxies are dustier and have much higher star - formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the strong correlation between extinction and age , which we show is unlikely to be an artifact of the modeling procedure , has important implications for an evolutionary sequence among lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> a unified scenario which accounts for the observed trends in bright lbgs is one in which a relatively short period of very rapid star - formation ( hundreds of m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 ) lasts for roughly 50100 myr , after which both the extinction and star - formation rate are considerably reduced and stars are formed at a more quiescent , but still rapid , rate for at least a few hundred myr . in our sample , a considerable fraction ( @xmath11% ) of the lbgs have best - fit star - formation ages @xmath12gyr , implied stellar masses of @xmath13 m@xmath9 , and are still forming stars at @xmath14 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 . </S>"
