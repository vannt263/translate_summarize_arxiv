    "in @xcite , some of the authors of this work developed and conducted first numerical testing of algorithms that allow the detection of small , very low emission sources embedded in a much larger background ( see also @xcite for an alternative bayesian technique ) .",
    "the algorithms developed required using some directional information for particles hitting the detectors . since collimation is not a viable option at the extremely low snr levels ( on the order of @xmath0 ) considered , it was suggested to use the so called compton type cameras , which are currently available for @xmath1 particles detection and are being developed for neutrons @xcite .",
    "the techniques of @xcite , developed and tested under some rather restrictive assumptions , require further detailed numerical scrutiny under more complex cargo scenarios than the ones of @xcite . indeed :    * some assumptions of @xcite ( e.g. , unstructured random background without cargo influence ) are not always fulfilled in real world situations . *",
    "some of the arguments were not entirely rigorous , e.g. , the ones that estimated theoretically the sensitivity and specificity levels of the detection method under a random variable independence assumption , which was fulfilled only approximately . *",
    "the forward modeling was done in a way that did not allow for complex cargo scenarios nor spatially varying absorption and scattering cross sections . * uncertainty in the direction detection ( which is better for @xmath1 cameras , but can go up to standard deviation of @xmath2 degrees for neutron compton type cameras ) was not taken into account .    overcoming these problems",
    "is the goal of the current text .",
    "clearly , there is no silver bullet here , which would assure detection under all possible circumstances .",
    "thus , a thorough study of the efficiency of the previously developed technique is called for . due to technical constraints of numerical implementation",
    ", we only address the @xmath3 case here .",
    "the implications of this restriction are discussed in section [ s : remarks ] .",
    "the @xmath4 case , as well as other extensions , will be treated in a subsequent publication .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows : necessary physics preliminaries are provided in section [ s : physics ] .",
    "section [ s : forward ] contains the description of the technique employed to solve the radiation transport problem through a cargo container ( forward model ) .",
    "the next section [ s : math ] addresses briefly the inverse problem algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the main section [ s : cases ] provides the detection results for various cargo container scenarios and their discussions .",
    "final remarks and conclusions are provided in section [ s : remarks ] . in particular , while in the examples of section [ s : cases ] the presence of a source was detected by finding its location , numerical evidence is provided of possible indications of presence of a source without detecting its actual position .",
    "in this section , we discuss the physics of gamma radiation pertaining to the application of interest .    the technique devised in @xcite",
    "is based on the availability of at least a small number of uncollided ( `` ballistic '' ) particles emanating from a small localized source , versus other particles ( background particles and source particles that have scattered ) .",
    "of particular interest as uncollided particles are the gamma emitted from characteristic lines of uranium . by having relatively narrow energy bins around such lines , one can enhance the signal - to - noise ratio for gamma radiation detected in such energy ranges .",
    "however , the four main lines for uranium-235 have somewhat low energies ( 143.8 , 166.3 , 185.7 , and 205.3 kev ) and can be attenuated easily by some amount of shielding material .",
    "for instance , particles emitted from the 185-kev line of u-235 ( the line with the strongest activity ) have an average mean - free - path in high - z materials of about 0.69 @xcite , and thus can be significantly attenuated . on the other hand , uranium-238 possesses gamma lines at higher energies ( i.e. , a line at 1.001 mev ) for which the mean - free - path in high - z materials is significantly larger ( 13.3 mean - free - paths ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will be advantageous to consider , as our signal of interest , the uncollided gamma rays from the 1.001 mev line of u-238",
    ".    however , other gamma particles may also be present in the energy range of interest . in our application",
    ", background radiation will be stemming from the concrete base located some distance below the container .",
    "significant gamma lines ( above the 1.001 mev line of u-238 ) should be taken into consideration as background radiation impinging the container .",
    "these lines include : the 1.461 mev line from potassium-40 , the 1.12 mev and 1.76 mev lines from bismuth-214 , and the 2.61 mev line from thallium-208 ( bismuth and thallium are daughter products from the decay of uranium-238 and thorium-232 , respectively , and are naturally found in concrete ) .    assuming a concrete slab thickness of 40 cm and 60 cm gap between the concrete surface and the bottom of the container , the background radiation emitted from the concrete slab and impinging the lateral and bottom sides of the container can be easily computed .",
    "gamma rays due to the heu source , any legitimate commercial source ( if any ) , and the background radiation entering the container will undergo scattering and absorption within the volume of the container . absorption and scattering within the container will reduce the amount of uncollided heu source particles reaching the detectors placed around the container ; recall that the signal of interest in our study are the gamma rays from the 1.001 mev line of u-238 . scattering will also cause gammas from energies higher than 1.001 mev to down - scatter into the energy of interest , adding noise to the signal .",
    "the radiation transport within the cargo container is governed by the linear boltzmann equation , written below using the multigroup approximation : @xmath5 for all positions @xmath6 , all directions @xmath7 , and all energy groups @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the volume of the cargo container , @xmath10 the unit sphere , @xmath11 the total number of energy groups , @xmath12 the photon angular flux in energy group @xmath13 , @xmath14 the total interaction cross section in group @xmath13 , @xmath15 the @xmath16-legendre moment of the scattering cross section from group @xmath17 to group @xmath13 , @xmath18 is the maximum anisotropy expansion order , and @xmath19 is the volumetric external source of photons in group @xmath13 ( stemming from the heu source and any other volumetric source , if present ) .",

    "the boundary condition function @xmath29 describes the background radiation impinging on the container due to the presence of a large concrete slab underneath the container .",

    "the multigroup structure employed is provided in table  [ tab : energygroupstructure ] .",
    "energy groups numbered 1 , 18 , 25 , 32 , 37 are purposefully narrow to represent accurately background radiation lines and the u-238 1.001 mev line .",

    "the photon transport equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : photon_transport ] ) , is discretized using standard techniques :    1 .",
    "an @xmath30 product gauss - legendre - tchebychev angular quadrature @xcite is employed ( with a few polar angles but a very high number of azimuthal angles to resolve properly the angular distribution in the 2d domain ) .",
    "2 .   spatial discretization based on a standard bilinear discontinuous finite element technique with upwinding at cell interfaces @xcite .",
    "transport sweeps and source iteration are employed to converge the scattering source and determine the angular photon flux , solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : photon_transport ] ) @xcite .    once the transport equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : photon_transport ] ) , has been iteratively solved , the outgoing angular photon flux at any boundary edge in 2d is recorded for subsequent utilization in the inverse problem algorithm .",
    "we now recap some of the analysis and algorithms of the previous paper @xcite ( a different , bayesian approach was developed in @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider a @xmath3 version of the problem .",
    "we assume that a small , low emission source of radioactive material ( e.g. , heu ) is placed inside of a significantly larger cargo .",
    "the ballpark linear size ratio is assumed to be on the order of @xmath31 - several meters long cargo container vs. several centimeters long source .",
    "the cargo will be depicted in our simulations as a square region surrounded by arrays of detectors .",
    "a significantly larger , in comparison with the source emission , uniform and isotropic random radiation background is present .",
    "our goal is to detect the presence of a source , or to claim its absence .",
    "since we are going to consider situations of extremely low signal - to - noise ratio , it is not expected that detection would be possible , unless the detectors are , at least to some degree , direction sensitive .",
    "collimating the detectors , as typically done in medical emission imaging ( e.g. , spect @xcite ) , provides the incoming directions of detected particles .",
    "however , collimation would most surely decimate the already low source signal to imperceptible levels .",
    "in fact , a similar situation occurs in spect , but the signal - to - noise ratio there is still much larger than in our intended application .",
    "one way to retain the snr while obtaining some directional information is to use compton @xmath1-cameras ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "compton cameras do not use collimation , but correspondingly provide less specific directional information : a surface cone of possible particle directions is detected , rather than a specific direction .",
    "analogous detectors ( albeit based on somewhat different principles ) are currently being developed for neutron detection @xcite .",
    "neutron and @xmath1 radiations are the main signals one can rely upon in determining the presence of illicit heu",
    ". we will use the name `` compton type camera '' without making a distinction between the types of particles considered .",
    "the reader can think , for instance , in terms of @xmath1-photons being detected ( the assumption adopted further in this text ) .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) , some `` electronic collimation '' techniques were developed and tested for converting compton data into data that would have come from physically collimated detectors .",
    "there is some limited snr loss attached to this conversion ( see section [ s : remarks ] ) .",
    "we will thus operate in the main body of this text as if we could collect the true directional information of incoming particles .",
    "the detection technique suggested in @xcite is based upon the assumption of existence of at least a small number of ballistic particles from the source reaching the detector arrays .",
    "the scattered source particles are considered to be a part of the uniform background .",
    "correspondingly , the snr of interest is defined as the ratio of the number of detected ballistic source particles to the number of all other detections .",
    "we will be working with signal - to - noise ratios of the order of @xmath32 , or @xmath33 , which is in line with numerical simulations of a shielded heu source placed in a cargo container .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the standard analytic tomographic techniques fail in this situation .",
    "it was argued , however , that a simple backprojection ( see section [ s : backproj ] ) might create reliably detectable bumps ( measured in standard deviations from the mean ) at the source location .",
    "a simple probabilistic analysis showed that a reliable ( with @xmath34 confidence ) detection can be expected , if the total number @xmath35 of detected particles reaches @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ratio of the radius of the possible source to the one of the cargo container ( @xmath38 in our simulations ) .",
    "it was also shown how to estimate specificity , and it was demonstrated that one can achieve simultaneously high levels of both .      in this section we briefly describe the backprojection algorithm used in @xcite . in that paper , uniform random background noise and a small low emission point source were simulated .",
    "it was assumed that a square container of interest was surrounded along all four sides by detector arrays which record the location ( more precisely , the detector bin ) of collision of each particle as well as its exact incoming direction .",
    "a backprojection image of the container was created by back propagating each particle from the detector into the numerical domain along its incoming line ( which , in general , is different from the original zig zag trajectory of the particle ) .",
    "a fast rasterization algorithm was used to add a value of @xmath39 to all pixels intersected by the line .",
    "thus , in the final image , the value at every pixel equaled the number of lines intersecting it .",
    "note that if a source is present , all backprojected ballistic source particles pass through the source location .",
    "after backprojection was completed , the image was tested for unusual peaks , that is , pixels with values several standard deviations above the mean .",
    "since high deviations are very unlikely to appear in a uniform random background , their presence signals a possible source .",
    "confidence values were assigned to detected sources following a probabilistic analysis similar to that in section [ s : probab ] .",
    "however , it was assumed in @xcite that exact incoming directions of particles could be measured , while in the current work we use a more realistic detector model which takes into account angular errors . in @xcite ,",
    "based on the assumption of absence of angular errors , it was shown that high confidence of detection and high sensitivity are to be expected when the total number of detected particles satisfies relation ( [ e : rule ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the same paper a more delicate situation was also considered , where only a `` gate '' of three arrays was present .",
    "the issue in this case was that backprojected data was non - uniform anymore , due to many particles being undetected . in this case , the mean and standard deviation were computed locally in a neighborhood of each pixel .",
    "a similar situation will also arise in the current work , the background being non - uniform not only due to missing detectors but also as a consequence of external radiation sources ( e.g. concrete flooring ) and different materials filling the cargo .",
    "as it has already been mentioned , several methods were developed in @xcite to convert compton type data to one that would come from truly collimated detectors .",
    "such transforms have been considered in the literature before ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the caveat here is that compton data is significantly over - determined , since the space of cones with apex at a detector is three - dimensional in @xmath3 and five - dimensional in @xmath4 .",
    "the solution adopted in most works addressing compton camera imaging was to restrict the data to a two - dimensional set in @xmath3 and a three - dimensional one in @xmath4 .",
    "however , this approach is unfeasible in the detection problem discussed here , since restriction would essentially eliminate all useful signal .",
    "thus , methods involving all compton data had to be developed and numerical implementation needed to be done in a way that avoided the speed and memory problems arising due to multi - dimensionality .",
    "the main conversion method considered in @xcite was equivalent to backprojection of each particle along its cone of possible incoming directions .",
    "thus , the values at every pixel in the backprojected image equaled the number of cones intersecting it .    in this text we restrict ourselves to using the directional data that would have been obtained by converting from compton camera measurements .",
    "here we introduce a modification to the treatment of @xcite that incorporates possible errors in detection of directions of incoming particles .",
    "consider a circular domain of interest of radius @xmath40 surrounded by detector arrays .",
    "suppose the detectors are collimated physically or electronically , so that directional information of all detected particles can be determined .",
    "we assume that the angular information recorded by the detectors has a gaussian error with standard deviation @xmath41 degrees .",
    "let us partition the source region into square pixels of dimension @xmath42 by @xmath42 and define @xmath43 .",
    "then the area contains approximately @xmath44 pixels .",
    "we also denote the total number of detected particles by @xmath35 .",
    "suppose @xmath45 lines ( backprojected particle trajectories ) intersect a given pixel @xmath46 and write @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of ballistic particles from the source and @xmath49 is the number of background particles . under the conditions of our scenarios",
    ", one can apply the central limit theorem and consider the number @xmath45 of lines intersecting a pixel being normally distributed with the mean @xmath50 and standard deviation @xmath51 .",
    "let us now choose a threshold value @xmath52 such that the probability of a normal variable to reach more than @xmath52 standard deviations above the mean in at least one out of @xmath53 independent realizations corresponds to the number of pixels .",
    "] is very small .",
    "we use in our experiments the number @xmath54 .",
    "note that a useful @xmath52 will change depending on the size of the pixels relative to the size of the whole domain , or equivalently , on the value of @xmath37 .",
    "( we will revisit this shortly . )",
    "we make the claim that a source has been detected if an abnormally high number @xmath45 of lines pass through a pixel @xmath46 , that is , if @xmath55 .",
    "the probability of at least @xmath56 lines crossing @xmath46 due to random reasons is approximately @xmath57 . taking into account the number of pixels @xmath58 , the probability of at least @xmath56 lines crossing at least one of the pixels due to random reasons ( a `` * * false positive * * '' ) can be approximated by @xmath59 the * true negative * rate is then given by @xmath60 or @xmath61^{m}.\\ ] ] now coming back to the value of @xmath52 , suppose we want to have a minimum confidence level @xmath62 .",

    ". if we are satisfied with a true negative rate of only @xmath67 and have just @xmath68 pixels , then @xmath69 will suffice . recall that @xmath58 is dependent on @xmath37 ,",
    "so we can instead write in the inequality for @xmath52 as @xmath70.\\ ] ] notice that this consideration is still valid when errors in direction determination are present    now consider the probability of missing a source that is present . here",
    "errors might play significant role .",
    "assume that we have an _ a priori _ ballpark estimate for @xmath48 . in @xmath71 units ,",
    "@xmath72 where @xmath73 is a positive constant and @xmath71 is the standard deviation of the distribution of the number of background trajectories passing through a pixel .",
    "however , since our detector has errors in its measurements , not all of the detected source particles detected are back projected through the pixel containing the source .",
    "let @xmath41 be the standard deviation of the error of the angular measurement .",
    "then if a particle is emitted from a source inside a pixel @xmath46 and is detected on the circular array , the probability that it will be back projected through @xmath74 is related to the size of the pixel @xmath42 , the distance from the boundary @xmath75 , and the standard deviation of the angular error @xmath41 . since the location of the source is not known _ a priori _ , we do not know what @xmath75 is .",
    "consider the worst case example where @xmath76 ( if the source is close to the boundary , detection is easier ) .",
    "then the detected particle is back projected through @xmath46 if and only if @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be defined as @xmath79 this number is the probability that given the normal distribution @xmath80 of angular errors , the back projection of a particle passes through the pixel @xmath46 ( that is , if @xmath81 ) .",
    "then , due to the error , only about @xmath82 background particles may be projected through pixel @xmath74 .",
    "our test detects a source at @xmath46 if @xmath83 , so it will miss it if @xmath84 .",
    "the probability of this happening ( the false negative rate ) is @xmath85 for example , if @xmath86 , then the probability of missing the source is at most @xmath87 .",
    "the true positive rate ( given by @xmath88 ) is what we call the * sensitivity*. if we require a particular sensitivity @xmath89 , then in order to detect a source with this sensitivity we need @xmath90.\\ ] ] recalling the requirement for @xmath52 given a confidence @xmath91 , this means @xmath92 + \\sqrt{2 } \\ , \\operatorname{erfc}^{-1 } [ 2(1-\\zeta)].\\ ] ] to detect a source with sensitivity",

    "so we require @xmath100 since the left hand side grows linearly with @xmath35 and the right hand side grows only as @xmath101 , the inequality will hold for sufficiently large @xmath35 .",
    "we can expect to reliably detect the source with given sensitivity and specificity , if the total particle count @xmath35 at the detectors is on the order of @xmath102 or higher . or , writing this without using coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath78 , @xmath104 ^ 2 p(1-p).\\label{e : rule_error}\\ ] ]      similar approach and algorithms were also developed for the fully @xmath4 compton data @xcite .",
    "this part still requires additional work , both on forward and inverse computations , and is thus postponed until the next publication .",
    "the relation of the @xmath3 model to the true @xmath4 situation is discussed in section [ s : remarks ] .",
    "in this section , we study the performance of the algorithm for various cargo / background / detector configurations and various snr levels .    in all subsections below , it is assumed that a small ( with @xmath38 ) source is placed into a larger cargo .",
    "the cargo configurations vary from case to case .",
    "we start with the simplest situation of spatially and angularly isotropic random background and then proceed to more difficult scenarios .    as it was explained in @xcite , even for very small values of snr , increasing observation time ( and thus the number of detected particles )",
    ", one could eventually reach the detection level .",
    "the question is , though , whether this observation time is practical ( observing a car at a border crossing for a week is clearly unreasonable ) .",
    "thus , in all cargo scenarios ( except the next section with uniformly random background ) , we show the observation time instead of the number of detected particles .",
    "doing so , we use the real parameters of cargo materials and heu source ( see section [ s : physics ] ) .",
    "we start with the simplest situation considered in @xcite .",
    "namely , we assume that the background radiation is uniform and isotropic in the space of all possible rays intersecting the cargo container .",
    "we thus ran @xmath105 ( sometimes @xmath31 ) random realizations of the radiation for each box , labeled by the pair of values of @xmath35 and snr .",

    "in this section , we make an interesting numerical observation , which needs to be studied further analytically and numerically .",
    "namely , numerical evidence that we provide below indicates that , unlike in previous scenarios , where detection of the presence of a source coincides with finding its exact location , there are situations when one might have a strong evidence of presence of the source , without detecting its location .",
    "this seems to depend on existence of narrow unfilled spaces that usually exist even in well loaded containers .      for the following figures , in the forward calculation all radiation ( source and background )",

    "in this scenario , there is no direct ( straight line ) path between the source and the detector arrays that does not pass through the iron blocks , which practically eliminated the chance to rely upon ballistic particles coming from the source .",

    "it is not only clearer geometrically , but also stronger numerically .",
    "indeed , the color scales are different between the top and bottom rows .",
    "otherwise the passages would not be seen well in the top row .",
    "so , the difference between the low and high intensities is about 6 times higher in the bottom picture than in the top one ( with an intermediate situation in the middle row ) .",

    "the results of this study show that the method developed in @xcite works well for detecting the presence of small amounts of special nuclear materials placed in large containers / trucks filled with various realistic types of cargo .",
    "not only sensitivity , but also specificity of the method , as it was shown in @xcite and in this text , can be very high even in cases of an extremely low snr , in the ballpark of @xmath127 .",
    "the suggested technique is highly parallelizable and can be run simultaneously with the measurements being collected .",
    "there are , however , various issues still to be addressed in the future work . among those , one can mention the following :    1 .",
    "the technique has been implemented to the full extent in the 2d situation only .",
    "although some trial runs have been done in @xmath4 , the full implementation of numerics ( for both forward modeling and detection ) still needs to be done .",
    "+ one can ask whether the @xmath3 implementation has any relation to the real world situation at all then , besides running the technique in numerically simpler situation . for instance , one wonders whether one could try to image a @xmath3 slice of the container .",
    "it is possible in principle , but it would clearly reduce significantly the already small snr , since the emission from the source is highly unlikely to honor the plane of the slice we choose for observation . this should render detectability to be much worse .",
    "some modeling of this has been done , which confirms this conclusion .",
    "+ on the other hand , the @xmath3 model we studied corresponds to the cylindrical @xmath4 geometry of the cargo and detectors .",
    "although this is also not a too realistic situation , it still can be considered as a useful trial run before the full @xmath4 technique is implemented .",
    "the very intriguing and potentially important numerical observation made in the final section of the paper is that the presence of a source whose shielding does not allow for any significant number of ballistic particles getting to the detectors could still be implied by highlighted cargo passages .",
    "although background radiation also can lead to this effect , our observation is that the strength of this highlighting is much stronger in the presence of a source .",
    "this observation needs to be made more precise by its analytic study , which we also intend to produce .",
    "3 .   the reader should have noticed that some corner artifacts arise in many of our reconstructions . in some cases they are strong enough to compete with the detected source .",
    "our preliminary study shows that this is just the effect of the square detector geometry that we choose .",
    "if a ring ( sphere ) of detectors is used , these artifacts are not present .",
    "one can deal with them easily in the square geometry as well , just by excluding the corners from the reconstruction domain .",
    "this comment will be expanded analytically and numerically in a future publications .",
