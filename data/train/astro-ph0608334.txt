    "the morphology , evolution and chemical composition of circumstellar disks and halos of pre - main - sequence intermediate - mass herbig ae / be stars is of key importance in the study of star and planet formation @xcite .",
    "emission features of silicates and pahs are commonly though not always observed @xcite and in a few cases emission from surface - hydrogen - terminated diamonds is also detected .",
    "this raises interesting and challenging questions as to how the diamonds form , why their emission is seen in only a few stars , and whether there is a link between circumstellar diamonds and the presence of nanodiamonds in meteorites .",
    "the existence of organic pahs in the nebular environment also provides astrobiological interest . in this paper",
    "we describe near - ir long - slit observations of one of the rare diamond c - h emitting objects , elias  1 .",
    "we focus on the spectroscopy and spatial distribution of diamond ( c - h ) , pah and continuum emission from the circumstellar environment , and make comparison with the related object hd  97048 .",
    "the pre - main - sequence star elias  1 ( v892 tau , elias  3 - 1 ) is a close binary with a separation of @xmath350 mas at pa @xmath350@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "its spectral type is uncertain ranging through a0 @xcite , a6 with @xmath5@xmath6  =  3.9 mag @xcite , b9 with @xmath5@xmath6  =  8.85 mag @xcite , with an @xmath7 value of 10.5 also reported @xcite .",
    "elias  1 has a very flat , possibly rising , sed in the near - ir to far - ir which is markedly different from that of hd  97048 @xcite , the two stars being classified as group ii and i , respectively .",
    "the sed for elias  1 is taken by @xcite to suggest the possible existence of an envelope in addition to a disk , or a flared disk .",
    "other elias  1 characteristics include x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite emission .",
    "an emission feature in the _ c. _ 3.5@xmath0 m region for elias  1 was first reported in 1982 by @xcite and was subsequently shown to have two components near 3.41 and 3.52@xmath0 m with an additional pah feature at 3.29@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the only previously detected example was hd  97048 @xcite .",
    "subsequent spectroscopic observations of elias  1 have been made @xcite , including iso ( sws ) data @xcite .",
    "the features at 3.43 and 3.53@xmath0 m remained unassigned until @xcite found a convincing correspondence between the astrophysical bands of elias  1 and hd  97048 and laboratory absorption spectra of the c - h stretching modes on hydrogen - terminated diamond nanocrystal films at @xmath3  1000  k @xcite .",
    "iso spectra of elias  1 covering the range 2.5  -  13.5 @xmath0 m @xcite contain absorption features due to water and co@xmath8 ice , and emission from pahs , diamonds and silicates , the last of these being absent from the spectrum of hd  97048 . in this paper",
    "we have chosen not to use the word ` nanodiamond ' in discussing the stellar emission features as their size is probably at least 50  nm @xcite in contrast to meteoritic nanodiamonds which are typically only 2 - 3  nm across @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the diamonds observed are exclusively those that are h - terminated at the surface ; absence of hydrogen or its substitution by other chemical groups on the surface in general give spectra outside the region studied .",
    "the only other herbig ae / be objects for which diamond emission is reported are bd@xmath940@xmath44124 @xcite and mwc 297 @xcite ; emission features attributed to diamond emission are also seen in the post - agb star hr  4049 @xcite but are relatively weak .",
    "unresolved at mm wavelengths @xcite , observations of the spatial distribution of the circumstellar emission of elias  1 comprise a contour map of the inner 0.2@xmath2 @xmath10 0.2@xmath2 region which exhibits asymmetry along the binary pa of 50@xmath11 @xcite , and speckle interferograms at k , l ( 0@xmath11 and 90@xmath11 ) and l at 45@xmath11 @xcite and at j , h , k and l@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted their data in terms of a core with a wavelength - dependent diameter of @xmath3 6 - 14 au , and a highly flattened halo elongated in the east - west direction with radius @xmath3 30 - 100 au in the form of a nearly edge - on circumstellar disk .",
    "based on observations covering a wider range of wavelengths and at higher resolution , @xcite proposed that the east - west elongation is due to scattered light from bipolar ( nebular ) lobes . from the pa 90@xmath11 and 0@xmath11",
    "data it was concluded that the components observed at j and h comprise a well - resolved narrow blue structure elongated east - west with a fwhm of _ c. _ 1@xmath2 and a second that is marginally resolved ( fwhm @xmath10.2@xmath2 ) , and that there is marginally resolved red structure at k and l@xmath13 which is more circular and symmetric . from a consideration of all the available data and a number of possible interpretations , @xcite proposed the existence of a bipolar nebula along the e - w axis as the origin of the e - w extension .",
    "they also discussed the existence of a possible stellar companion , noting that their k and l@xmath12 data could be fitted by a close binary with separation oriented at pa 45@xmath11 or 135@xmath11 with separation @xmath140.1@xmath2 , together with some extended structure .",
    "recent diffraction - limited speckle interferometric observations confirm that elias  1 is indeed a close binary system with these characteristics , the separation being 0.05@xmath2 with pa 50@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "observations of the herbig ae / be star elias 1 were carried out between 20th july - 11th september 2004 at the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the 1 - 5 @xmath15 m imager - spectrometer ( uist ) was used for the long - slit spectroscopic observations .",
    "the slit dimensions were 0.48@xmath2 x 120@xmath2 and the resolving power = 700 .",
    "the short - l grism was used to obtain spectra in the wavelength region 2.905 - 3.638@xmath0 m in combination with an insb array of 1024 x 1024 pixels , giving a spatial resolution of 0.12@xmath2 pix@xmath16 .",

    "the sky background emission was subtracted from the standard and object frames and the object spectra were divided by the standard .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the observations is very consistent .",
    "a further exposure along e - w was made on 27 july but due to poor seeing the psf was _ c. _ 0.7@xmath2 and was not included in this analysis .",
    "the data were partially reduced by the orac - dr ( automated reduction ) pipeline for uist and further reductions were carried out with the figaro reduction package .",
    "the spectra were analysed using the iraf reduction package ; the continuum was fitted and subtracted from the spectra and lorentzians were used to fit the emission bands .",

    "in common with similar long - slit studies of red rectangle pah features ( song et al .",
    "2003 ) , one of the objectives was to investigate any evolution in profile shape , central wavelength etc . of the pah c - h stretch and ( particularly ) the c - h diamond features with increase in offset from the star .",
    "the summed 3.0 - 3.6@xmath0 m spectra for elias  1 along the n - s axis for the inner @xmath17 relative to the star are shown in fig 1 and are similar to the ukirt data of @xcite although the pf@xmath18 line of hydrogen which sits atop the 3.3@xmath0 m pah band is much weaker in our spectra .",

    "the assignments of the c - h diamond features have been described elsewhere @xcite and are not reproduced here .",
    "the best match between experimental absorption spectra and the astrophysical data is achieved for a temperature of _ c. _",
    "1000  k @xcite .",
    "laboratory data have revealed a strong dependence of the spectrum on particle size , indicating that the diamonds in elias  1 ( and hd  97048 ) are probably at least 50  nm in diameter and are likely formed in a cvd - type process @xcite .",

    "as described in the following sub - section , the diamond distribution in elias  1 is confined to a region quite close to the star within @xmath148 au ( fwhm , gaussian fitted ) . by taking data extractions ` on - star ' at the point of maximum emission strength and",
    "secondly at the greatest possible offset for which a reasonable signal - to - noise is still maintained , we searched for variation in the diamond features but did not find evidence for this to within 0.15% ( in @xmath22 ) , 20% ( in fwhm ) , and 10% ( in relative intensity ) .",
    "the psf of _",
    "c. _ 0.5@xmath2 is larger than desirable relative to the diamond emission spatial extent of fwhm @xmath10.34@xmath2 .",
    "however , changes in the relative band strengths of the components , in peak wavelength or in profile shape that might occur due to change in temperature with offset , diamond size effects on the spectra , or in the relative emission contributions of the different c - h supporting diamond facets , would be discernible .",
    "this result points to a rather specific set of formation conditions and/or surface chemistry , possibly not unrelated to the rarity of the appearance of the features .    of the main pah emission bands ,",
    "only the relatively weak 3.3@xmath0 m feature occurs in the spectral range recorded and is subject to contamination by telluric methane and water lines , as well as from the pf@xmath18 emission line of the star . as for the diamond emission bands",
    "there was no measurable change in the feature profile with offset but a 20% change in width would have been detected .",
    "slit alignments along the n - s and the e - w axes were selected in order to probe the spatial distribution of the pah ( 3.3@xmath0 m ) , diamond and continuum emission relative to the star .",
    "although adaptive optics and larger mirror size ( and speckle interferometric observations ) offer a lower effective psf , high signal - to - noise data achieved with moderate exposure times and at high altitude on mauna kea provide an attractive option with relatively straightforward data reduction procedures .",
    "determination of the psf was achieved using the standard ( point source ) star bs 1203 and gave a stable value of 0.53(2)@xmath2 ( see table 1 . )",
    "the n - s and e - w spatial distributions as recorded for the pah ( 3.3@xmath0 m , continuum - subtracted ) , diamond ( 3.53@xmath0 m , continuum - subtracted ) and continuum ( 3.60@xmath0 m ) are given in figs 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the set of diamond features near 3.43@xmath0 m follow the 3.53@xmath0 m distribution within signal - to - noise contraints , the measured spatial fwhm for 3.53@xmath0 m being 0.590@xmath2 ( ns ) and 0.603@xmath2 ( ew ) , and 0.603@xmath2 ( ns ) and 0.597@xmath2 ( ew ) for the 3.43@xmath0 m group .",
    "figs 4 and 5 show the results when a richardson - lucy ( rl ) deconvolution algorithm was employed to deconvolve the profiles .",
    "for the n - s slit position ( pa  =  0@xmath4 ) in fig 4 the profiles for pah , diamond and continuum overlap very well for the inner @xmath23 , with the latter two overlapping for all offsets .",
    "however , the pah distribution extends weakly about three times further , with slightly greater strength in the n direction . for the e - w slit position ( pa  =  90@xmath4 ) shown in figure 5 the diamond and continuum distributions are the same within the signal - to - noise .",
    "in contrast , the pah distribution is very broad and skewed slightly towards w.    the deconvolved continuum - subtracted 3.53@xmath0 m elias  1 diamond feature shows a symmetrical distribution n , s , e and w of the central star .",
    "this is consistent with the circular symmetric component described by @xcite for k and l@xmath13 who noted that the latter filter at 3.69  @xmath24  0.315  @xmath0 m includes the strong 3.42 and 3.53@xmath0 m features observed in our study and that are now known to be due to diamond emission .",
    "the distribution for diamond emission has a fwhm of 0.34@xmath25 giving a gaussian fwhm diameter of @xmath148 au where a distance to elias  1 of 140 pc @xcite was adopted .",
    "the continuum profile that is generally taken to arise from thermal emission by larger grains is very similar .",
    "the pah distribution is extended relative to diamond and continuum emission along both slit axes but more so for e - w than n - s .",
    "for e - w a signal is discernible to @xmath260.7@xmath25 or @xmath26100 au w and e relative to the star .",
    "this long - slit spectroscopic result agrees well with the findings of @xcite who found a narrow e - w elongated blue halo in j and h with fwhm of about 1@xmath25 , the n - s extent only being about 0.2@xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that the new data provide strong evidence for a pah - containing bipolar nebula oriented close to e - w but , given the asymmetry in the pah distribution along both e - w and n - s ( see figs 4 and 5 ) , tilted slightly with respect to the observer .",

    "it was deduced that the fwhm sizes are consistent with predictions for a circumstellar disk oriented pole - on , with the diamond emission originating in an inner region . the diamond fwhm emission for hd  97048",
    "is reported by @xcite to be 41 au and that of the continuum 32 au , which compare with our elias  1 results of @xmath10.34@xmath2 ( 48 au ) for both diamond and the continuum .",
    "@xcite have reported spatially resolved 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission for hd  97048 which is more extended than the diamond and continuum emission and hence similar to our results for elias  1 .",
    "the pah distribution data for hd  97048 is incomplete due to a noisy section near 3.3@xmath0 m falling in the + 0.0 - 0.2@xmath2 region and a value for the fwhm was not quoted .",
    "however , from the negative offset data ( figure 3 of the paper ) and assuming a symmetrical spatial profile , a fwhm of @xmath360 au can be estimated .",
    "an extended 3.3@xmath0 m distribution for hd  97048 is also consistent with a comparison between the iso - sws ( 20@xmath2 x 33@xmath2 ) spectrum and the spectra of habart et al .",
