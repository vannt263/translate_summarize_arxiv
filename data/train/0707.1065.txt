    "in this paper we would like to ascertain the connection between some nonperturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics .    the approach ( presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is based on the idea that the off - diagonal components of the non - abelian gluon field become composite particles , with a separation between their color - charge and spin degrees of freedom @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the authors apply the mean - field approach where a mean - field state is constructed integrating over the charge neutral spin degree of freedom of the off - diagonal gluon .",
    "the focus of the second approach @xcite is the breaking down of the non - abelian gauge group into smaller pieces .",
    "for example : @xmath0 or @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the procedure also uses some aspects of an old method by heisenberg to calculate the n - point green s function of a strongly interacting , non - linear theory .",
    "using these ideas one can give approximate calculations of the 2 and 4-points green s function of the theories considered .",
    "this method can be called as _ the method of collective coordinates _ since in this approach some set of quantum degrees of freedom fluctuate in phase .",
    "in this section we will describe in shorten the method of collective coordinates method .",
    "the classical su(n ) @xmath3 yang - mills equations are @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the field strength ; @xmath6 are the su(n ) color indices ; @xmath7 is the coupling constant ; @xmath8 are the structure constants for the su(n ) gauge group . in quantizing the system given in eqs .",
    "( [ sec2 - 1 - 10 ] ) - via heisenberg s method @xcite one first replaces the classical fields by field operators @xmath9 .",
    "this yields the following differential equations for the operators @xmath10 these nonlinear equations for the field operators of the nonlinear quantum fields can be used to determine expectation values for the field operators @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is some quantum state ) .",
    "one can also use these equations to determine the expectation values of operators that are built up from the fundamental operators @xmath11 .",
    "the simple gauge field expectation values , @xmath14 , are obtained by average eq . over",
    "some quantum state @xmath13 @xmath15 one problem in using these equations to obtain expectation values like @xmath16 , is that these equations involve not only powers or derivatives of @xmath16 ( _ i.e. _ terms like @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) but also contain terms like @xmath19 . starting with eq .",
    "one can generate an operator differential equation for the product @xmath20 thus allowing the determination of the green s function @xmath21 @xmath22 however this equation will in turn contain other , higher order green s functions .",
    "repeating these steps leads to an infinite set of equations connecting green s functions of ever increasing order .",
    "in fact these equations are the dyson - schwinger equatons but ordinary the designation `` dyson - schwinger equatons '' is reserved for the application in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "we consider these equations in nonperturbative quantum field theory .",
    "this construction , leading to an infinite set of coupled , differential equations , does not have an exact , analytical solution and so must be handled using some approximation .",
    "the quantization of equations - evidently is very hard and deriving exact results is probably impossible . in order to do some calculations we give an approximate method which leads to the 2 and 4-points green s functions only . in order to derive the equations describing the quantized field we average the lagrangian over a quantum state @xmath23 @xmath24",
    "now we will detail the kind of physical situations we wish to describe .",
    "the model given here is similar to stationary turbulence when there are time dependent fluctuations in any point of the liquid but all averaged quantities are time independent . for a qft",
    "this means that all green s functions are time independent and there is a correlation between quantum fields in different points at one moment @xmath25 in linear and perturbative qft this is not the case because the interaction is carried by quanta which move with a speed less than or equal to the speed of light . in these theories",
    "the correlation between quantum fields in different points at the same time is zero .",
    "@xmath26 in this sense one can say that nonperturbative qft in some physical situations is very close to turbulence , _ i.e. _ in nonperturbative qft there may exist extended objects where quantized fields at all points are correlated between themselves ( example from qcd are flux tubes and glueballs ) .",
    "such objects fall into two categories    1 .",
    "the averaged value of all quantized fields are zero ( all components are in one or more collective modes ) @xmath27 but the square of these fields are nonzero @xmath28 2",

    "has both ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the key idea in this approach is _ to cut off an infinite equations set connecting all green functions . _ for this we average the lagrangian of a gauge theory @xmath37 schematically the averaged lagrangian has @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms .",

    "the slave - boson decomposition ( spin - charge separation ) of the @xmath92 gauge field @xmath40 ( @xmath90 and @xmath93 ) proceeds as follows @xcite : we first separate the diagonal cartan component @xmath94 from the off - diagonal components @xmath95 , and combine the latter into the complex field @xmath96 .",
    "we then introduce a complex vector field @xmath97 with @xmath98 we also introduce two spinless complex scalar fields @xmath99 and @xmath100 . the ensuing decomposition of @xmath101 is @xcite @xmath102 a decomposition of @xmath101 into spinless bosonic scalars @xmath103 which describe the gluonic holons that carry the color charge of the @xmath101 , and a color - neutral spin - one vector @xmath97 which is the gluonic spinon that carries the statistical spin degrees of freedom of @xmath101 .",
    "the mean - field approximation applied in this case is averaging the @xmath92 yang - mills action both over the color - spinon @xmath97 and the cartan component @xmath89 of the gauge field .",
    "since we are only interested in the phase structure of the ensuing mean - field theory , it is sufficient to consider the free energy in a london limit where the slave - boson condensates @xmath104 are spatially uniform .",

    "the free energy is given by @xmath110 this ground state is highly degenerate , but the combination on the left - hand side of is not the proper gauge invariant condensate .",
    "the gauge invariant condensate is given by @xmath111 and one can employ it to remove the infinite degeneracy of the hyperbolic vacuum .",
    "from we conclude that the ground state value @xmath112 of the gauge invariant condensate is bounded from below by a non - vanishing quantity , @xmath113 when @xmath114 is larger than the lower bound in , there are eight solutions @xmath115 to the equations that define the vacuum @xmath116 but when @xmath114 coincides with the lower bound there are only four solutions , @xmath117 which correspond to the vertices of the hyperbola .",
    "the solutions of describe the generic situation where both condensates are non - vanishing .",
    "the remaining ground state is doubly degenerate under exchange of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which correspond to the physical scenario that in general the london limit densities are unequal .    finally , the degenerate solutions correspond to the limit where one of the two condensates vanishes , and again by selecting the physical quadrant @xmath120 one can remove the degeneracy .",
    "according to the ground state value of is non - vanishing for all non - vanishing values of the coupling constant @xmath121 .",
    "this suggests that in the yang - mills theory the gauge invariant condensate is also nonvanishing for all non - vanishing values of the coupling constant .",
    "this would mean that the mass gap in the yang - mills theory is present for all values of the coupling , and it vanishes only asymptotically in the short distance limit where the gluons become asymptotically free and massless .",
    "the classical treatment of the mean - field theory suggests that the condensate is always non - vanishing , hence a mass gap is present for all nontrivial values of the coupling .",
    "one can to inspect what effects spatially homogeneous quantum fluctuations around the classical mean - field value have on this condensate .",
    "for this it is necessary to improve the free energy so that it also includes the contribution from the momenta @xmath122 that are canonically conjugate to the ( spatially homogeneous ) condensates @xmath123 .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the possibility of a spin - charge separation in the yang - mills theory may occur .",

    "we would like to compare the collective coordinate method briefly sketched in section [ collective ] with a spin - charge separation briefly sketched in section [ slave ] .",
    "the deep connection between the collective coordinate method ( ccm ) and the spin - charge separation method ( scsm ) is the existence of two condensates @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eq s in ccm and @xmath118 and @xmath119 in eq .",

    "this difference probably is connected with the fact that the free energy @xmath124 has derived from one - loop approximation but the potential @xmath133 is derived by the assumption about a non - perturbative structure of two - point green function .    the spherically symmetric solution from the section [ bag ] ( a bag filled with quantum su(3 ) gauge field which are presented by the scalar fields @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) is plotted in fig .
