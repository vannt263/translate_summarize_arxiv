    "the existence of string loops with dynamically stabilised winding in a compact space was first demonstrated by iglesias and blanco - pillado @xcite , using the klebanov - strassler geometry @xcite .",
    "they considered strings at the tip of the throat , with geodesic wrappings in the @xmath6 which regularises the conifold singularity .",
    "although they derived a lower bound for the angular momentum of a loop with a given number of windings - below which the windings became unstable - the result must remain of purely theoretical interest to cosmology as long as a specific mechanism for winding formation ( and hence for the formation of the string angular momentum ) is not considered .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose such a mechanism , which leads to the formation of string configurations such as those investigated in @xcite and to investigate the resulting string dynamics with specific reference to their cosmologically observable consequences .    assuming that a velocity correlations regime in the post - inflationary epoch as in @xcite leads naturally to the formation of geodesic windings we show that the winding number ( @xmath7 ) , total energy ( @xmath8 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath9 ) of the string are specified precisely by the model parameters",
    "that is , by the parameters which define the klebanov - strassler geometry ( in this case specifically by the value of the warp factor @xmath10 ) and those which determine the scale of the string network ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "substituting for @xmath9 and @xmath7 in the bound referred to above then demonstrates the stability of these windings , at least under the assumption that @xmath9 remains approximately constant over small time scales after the moment of initial loop formation . by assuming also that the total energy of the string remains approximately constant ( i.e. by neglecting the loss of @xmath8 and @xmath9 via gravitational wave emission over small time scales )",
    ", we then determine the equation of motion for the four dimensional string radius @xmath13 , and solve to find a ( generically ) oscillating solution .",
    "crucially we observe that the qualitative behaviour of the loop depends on the value of the warp factor @xmath10 with @xmath14 leading to an initial phase of expansion and @xmath15 leading to an initial phase of contraction .",
    "the fixed point solution @xmath16 is a static , non - oscillatory solution . in both oscillatory modes ( initially contracting _ and _ initially expanding ) we find that the period of the oscillation is inversely proportional to @xmath17 , and proportional to the initial size of the loop @xmath18 .",
    "following @xcite we refer to these objects as non - topological cycloops .",
    "the layout of the paper is then as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the relevant klebanov - strassler background , focusing on the geometry of the conifold tip . in section 3",
    "we show how the assumption of a velocity correlations regime yields a dynamical model of winding formation after the end of inflation .",
    "section 4 recaps the generic results of @xcite which we then combine with the results of the previous section to give explicit expressions for the winding number , energy and angular momentum of the string .",
    "the equation of motion for the loop radius is then derived and solved in section 5 and a brief summary of the main results together with a discussion of their cosmological implications and possible consequences for experimental observations is presented in section 6 .",
    "finally the two appendices at the end of this work deal with issues which arise within the text : appendix i outlines the method of eulerian substitution of the third kind which is used to integrate the differential equation involving @xmath19 and @xmath13 derived in section 5 .",
    "appendix ii gives a detailed description of the hopf fibration of the 3-sphere , which is introduced briefly in section 2 and used throughout the following analysis .",
    "the klebanov - strassler geometry is the canonical example of a background which resolves a conifold singularity in type iib string theory .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the original paper @xcite for a more thorough discussion .",
    "the essential point is that the conifold is the cone over an @xmath20 base space .",
    "when we deform the conifold , the @xmath21 shrinks to zero size , and the ten dimensional metric factorises into the ( warped ) product of @xmath22 . in",
    "canonical coordinates the effective metric of the klebanov - strassler geometry at the tip of the warped throat takes the following form ; @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the usual four - dimensional minkowski metric , @xmath17 is the square of the warp factor such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the radius of the three - sphere defined by , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the number of units of flux wrapping the internal space , which is also equal to the number of fractional @xmath293-branes at the bottom of the throat , @xmath30 is the string coupling , @xmath31 is the fundamental length scale of the string and @xmath32 is a numerical constant of order one .",
    "the relation between the size of the @xmath6 and the warp factor induced by the back reaction of the fluxes is , @xmath33 where the constant @xmath34 is the deformation parameter of the conifold .",
    "of course the relations ( [ eq : r^2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a_0 ^ 2vsr^2 ] ) remain true in any coordinate system , and we will find it convenient to use the hopf fibration of the three - sphere when considering the formation of geodesic windings .",
    "these are the kind of windings we expect to form in the presence of velocity correlations which impart an initial ( constant ) angular momentum density to each point along the string . in hopf",
    "coordinates the @xmath6 is described as a one - parameter family of flat two - tori ( to which it is topologically equivalent ) @xcite and the canonical metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) reduces to a much simpler form , @xmath35 the killing vectors also adopt a simple form , and are always parallel to the unit vectors in the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38-directions . fixing the value of the @xmath37-coordinate such that @xmath39 then selects a flat @xmath40 sub - manifold and",
    "windings which follow the killing - directions in this manifold are necessarily geodesic in the full @xmath6 .",
    "however the choice of gauge in this respect is somewhat arbitrary , as we are free to choose @xmath41 .",
    "this simplifies both the resulting metric and the killing vectors of the @xmath40 , the latter now being _ identical _ to the unit vectors in the remaining @xmath36 and @xmath38-directions . although it may be shown explicitly that the lagrangian density @xmath42 for a string loop with geodesic windings in the @xmath6 is @xmath43-independent in _ any _ coordinate system , the simple form of the killing vectors in hopf coordinates allows us to more easily calculate @xmath44 .",
    "a thorough treatment of the hopf fibration of the three - sphere , and of the description of geodesic windings in both canonical and hopf coordinates is given in appendix ii , along with a coordinate - independent geometric analysis .",
    "we now proceed to construct our dynamical model of winding formation : in the velocity correlations regime the number of windings per loop - in a loop of size @xmath45 - is @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fraction of the total string length which lies in the extra dimensions and is defined via @xcite , @xmath48 substituting this back into the expression above gives a unique physical physical solution , @xmath49 we note that the condition @xmath50 ensures that @xmath51 .",
    "importantly one notes that the number of windings increases linearly with time , with an overall coefficient modulated by the presence of the warp factor .",
    "alternatively one can choose to solve for @xmath52 rather than the winding number ; @xmath53 indicating that the magnitude of the warping imposes a physical constraint on the length of the string in the extra dimensions .",
    "we can also identify this quantity with the velocity of the string in the compact space .",
    "imagine that the `` end point '' of the string at the horizon moves with a fixed velocity @xmath54 in the extra dimensions .",
    "then at time @xmath12 there will be approximately , @xmath55 windings within the horizon ( with @xmath56 ) and the number of windings within a fraction @xmath11 of the horizon is therefore , @xmath57 this is equal to the number of windings per loop , for loops formed at time @xmath12 in the scaling regime . with this identification",
    "we see that @xmath58 and note the physical conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are automatically satisfied by the condition @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore it is intuitively obvious that @xmath47 , @xmath61 as @xmath62 because the @xmath63 solution of the klebanov - strassler model corresponds to minkowski space in @xmath64 dimensions . )",
    ", the rationale behind this statement is the following ; if no fluxes exist to provide an effective potential with which to compactify the extra dimensions , there can be no back reaction on the ordinary four - dimensional minkowski manifold . hence @xmath65 and @xmath66 automatically , leading to a flat six - dimensional space in place of the metric ( [ eq : metric])/([eq : metric2 ] ) .",
    "similarly the other dimensions of the bulk cy space are no longer flux - compactified .",
    "in such a scenario the formula ( [ eq : a_0 ^ 2vsr^2 ] ) would not be valid as , by definition , it holds only for @xmath50 .",
    "] in this case there are no internal fluxes , and thus no compact extra dimensions implying that no windings can exist .",
    "we can also understand why @xmath47 , @xmath67 as @xmath68 if we realise that windings are effectively correlations which can only form _ within _ the horizon .",
    "the horizon in the infinite dimensions advances according to the expression , @xmath69 whereas in our background the horizon distance in calabi - yau space ( @xmath6 ) is simply , @xmath70 although the expression @xmath71 is strictly unphysical ( corresponding to an extremal horizon ) , the limit @xmath68 corresponds to a situation in which the infinite dimensions are `` closed off '' so that the string exists only in the compactified space ( hence @xmath72 ) . in a time interval @xmath73 , the value of @xmath17 limits the increase of the horizon distance in the infinite directions ( but not in the compact space ) via , @xmath74 which places a limit on how fast the correlations can form .",
    "strictly speaking , the horizon in the infinite direction advances by a distance @xmath75 when the horizon in the compact space advances by @xmath73 .",
    "the end point of the string , which must of course move with resultant velocity @xmath76 , must therefore cover a total distance _ in the compact space _",
    "@xmath77 given by , @xmath78 which limits the effective velocity of the string in the extra dimensions to , @xmath79 .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 is then given simply by the ratio of the string velocity in the compact space to the speed of light , @xmath80 .",
    "happily we find that the details of the compactification scheme determine @xmath81 , @xmath47 and @xmath82 uniquely . in un - warped space ( [ eq : n1 ] ) ( which was taken directly from @xcite ) should be modified to give @xmath83 . however using this in conjunction with ( [ eq : omega_l_1 ] ) gives @xmath84 as the only possible solution .",
    "as there are good physical grounds ( outlined above ) for believing that the identification @xmath80 ( [ eq : omega_l_v ] ) is valid we therefore choose to leave the formula ( [ eq : n1 ] ) unchanged , even in the presence of warped space . ]",
    "we wish to consider a string loop which has windings over the full @xmath6 .",
    "a previous study was initiated by @xcite in which euler variables were used to describe the @xmath6 as an @xmath85 group manifold .",
    "this foliates the three sphere into a one - parameter set of flat tori . for fixed angle @xmath86",
    ", the metric then reduces to that of a flat two - torus .",
    "the strings therefore only wrap a two - dimensional sub - manifold of the full three - sphere .",
    "we wish to generalize this result to consider windings over the full @xmath6 using the hopf map .",
    "we use the following ansatz to describe a string loop , with general , non - specific windings around the @xmath6 @xmath87 where we have chosen our gauge so as to identify the world - sheet coordinate @xmath88 with the time coordinate in the lorentz frame of the loop , i.e. @xmath89 . in keeping with the physical scenario we are considering ,",
    "we specify the ansatz completely so that @xmath90 and @xmath91 describe _ geodesic _ windings .",
    "as previously stated , in hopf coordinates the killing vectors of the three - sphere take a particularly simple form and are parallel to the unit vectors @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so that geodesics windings are described by ; @xmath95 where @xmath96 represent the number of physical windings present in each angular direction .",
    "note that the factor of two in front of the @xmath97 term is simply an artifact of the coordinate system , resulting from the fact that the principle range of the @xmath36-coordinate is twice that of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    ", @xmath98 , @xmath99 . ]",
    "plugging ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) and ( [ eq : psi , theta , phi ] ) into the standard nambu - goto term of the @xmath29-string action ( and ignoring the topological chern - simons term and other flux - dependent contributions ) we have ; @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the tension of the @xmath29-string .",
    "rescaling the tension to absorb the string coupling allows us to also consider the @xmath103-string .",
    "in the warped deformed conifold , the tension spectrum of a general @xmath104 string ( in the large @xmath105 or large @xmath106 limit ) is given by the well - known formula @xcite @xmath107 which we assume to be valid for @xmath108 and @xmath109 in order for back - reaction effects to be neglected .",
    "in fact we may simplify our result even further by an appropriate gauge choice with respect to the angular coordinates .",
    "since we know that geodesics of the compact space correspond to great circles on the @xmath6 , we may set either of the winding numbers @xmath110 or @xmath111 to zero without loss of generality .",
    "the resulting string action with geodesic windings on the @xmath6 ( in hopf coordinates ) is therefore , @xmath112 the resulting constants of motion are then ; @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "the first expression is simply the hamiltonian , and the second corresponds to the total angular momentum of the string in the compact directions , no centripetal force is acting upon it .",
    "the internal ( compact ) dimensions are parameterised in terms of the angular variables @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and so the motion through the @xmath6 may be measured in @xmath115^{-1}$ ] . as the effective radius of `` rotation '' for any point along the string is simply the radius of the three - sphere , multiplication by @xmath26 converts this `` angular velocity '' into the `` true velocity '' of the string",
    ". however , even here we must be careful - as the string has no internal structure , the `` velocity '' of the string parallel to itself ( in this case parallel to the geodesic windings ) is not clearly defined .",
    "it is therefore possible ( in principle ) for @xmath116 though this does _ not _ violate causality due to the boost invariance of the string along its length . ] again using our ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz])-([eq : psi , theta , phi ] ) we see that these expressions become : @xmath117 now iglesias and blanco - pillado @xcite have shown that , for a loop which is stationary in @xmath118 dimensions ( i.e @xmath119 ) , the energy of the string configuration is minimised precisely for , @xmath120 and @xmath121 these results are obtained by first re - writing @xmath122 in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath123 , @xmath26 and @xmath124 and then substituting into the expression for @xmath8 ( so that @xmath125 ) , finally minimising with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "technically this gives the first condition ( @xmath126 ) , and the second condition @xmath127 is then obtained by further substitution into the expression for @xmath9 .",
    "now any dynamical model we construct for the formation of geodesic windings _ and _ for the motion of the string after loop formation must be consistent with these general results . at first sight we see that our model suggests @xmath128 , which does not correspond ( in general ) to the energy minimisation condition @xmath129 .",
    "in fact these two conditions only coincide for the specific value @xmath16 , where the velocity in both compact and non - compact dimensions is @xmath130 .",
    "we would not expect such a string configuration to undergo time evolution under the influence of its own internal dynamics , although it may still `` shrink '' via the loss of mass - energy ( and angular momentum ) due to gravitational wave emission and this possibility is discussed in section 6 .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the value of the warp factor is exactly @xmath131 , the energy of the string configuration will be automatically minimised from the moment of loop formation i.e. the initial radius of the string loop @xmath132 and the initial angular momentum @xmath133 will be related via @xmath134 , and the velocity of the string in the compact space will be @xmath135 .",
    "however when @xmath136 , the string velocity in the compact space is too small to provide enough angular momentum to `` match '' the radius of the loop i.e. the angular momentum required for a cycloop of radius @xmath123 to minimise the energy of its configuration .",
    "alternatively one can understand this as a string loop with fixed energy , changing configuration in order to minimise the surface to energy ratio .",
    "hence from the arguments in iglesias , we expect that @xmath136 implies @xmath137 . similarly if @xmath138 this should imply that the initial angular momentum of the loop exceeds the optimum value for a loop of that size and we find the converse result , namely @xmath139 . in a full string theory compactification ,",
    "the warp factor is exponentially small and therefore this would appear to be the dominant string channel .",
    "however we will consider a more phenomenological approach in this paper , and consider a range of values for the warping .",
    "furthermore , as stated above , these results should hold true for any physically viable dynamical model .",
    "it is therefore worth testing the theory developed in section 2 to ensure consistency in this matter . in short",
    "iglesias and blanco - pillado s arguments @xcite regarding the energy minimisation condition ( for all @xmath123 , @xmath9 ) ought to be consistent with our own dynamical model of @xmath133 and @xmath132 outlined above .",
    "because we are dealing with geodesic windings , we may always re - define our coordinate system so as to identify the variable @xmath7 from ( [ eq : n1 ] ) with the variable @xmath140 , both of which represent the total number of _ physical _ windings in the compact space - hence @xmath141 .",
    "we now plug in the expressions for @xmath82 ( [ eq : n1 ] ) , @xmath129 ( [ eq : energymin2 ] ) and @xmath142 into ( [ eq : constants2 ] ) ( with @xmath143 ) to find the resulting terms in place of the usual expression @xmath144 , taking advantage of the fact that @xmath145 in this case .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath146 which is equivalent to ( [ eq : constants_dynamical ] ) for @xmath147 .",
    "we therefore see that the total energy is split half and half between the rest mass of the loop in warped minkowski space , and the kinetic energy due to motion in the @xmath6 . ]",
    "@xmath148 hence we see that the second part of the energy minimisation condition ( [ eq : energymin2 ] ) implies the first , and vice - versa , as expected for consistency .",
    "however , as noted above , in general we have @xmath149 from ( [ eq : omega_l_v ] ) which is not equal to @xmath17 unless @xmath150 giving the _ constant _ values @xmath151 under such special circumstances we would not expect the string configuration to evolve in time due to its own internal dynamics , though the emission of gravitational waves due to accelerated motion of the string , and the resulting shrinkage of the loop radius @xmath123 must still be accounted for as mentioned previously .",
    "considering the more general case ( @xmath152 ) and substituting @xmath82 ( [ eq : n1 ] ) , @xmath153 ( [ eq : omega_l_v ] ) and @xmath142 into ( [ eq : constants2 ] ) - keeping @xmath143 - gives us @xmath154 which implies that @xmath155 we find that the total energy of a cycloop with radius @xmath142 is independent of @xmath17 . at first glance",
    "this seems nonsensical : the value of the warp factor determines the velocity in the compact space at the moment of loop formation via @xmath156 , which in turn determines the initial number of loops via @xmath157 .",
    "a cycloop moving with greater velocity in the compact space would therefore have a greater number of windings than a slower moving string with the same radius in the non - compact directions .",
    "consequently an increase in the kinetic energy of the loop would seem to go hand in hand with an increase in the total rest mass .",
    "however although this is clearly true in _ un - warped _ space , we must remember that the presence of the warp factor _ also _ reduces the four dimensional energy density via the effective tension @xmath158 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : constants_general ] ) suggests that even though a smaller warp factor implies a greater rate of winding formation and a greater kinetic energy for the windings in the compact space , the would - be increase in the total energy of the cycloop is completely off - set by the reduction in four dimensional energy density .",
    "the question then remains : what happens if the energy minimisation conditions are not automatically satisfied at the moment of loop formation @xmath12 ?",
    "this is of course equivalent to the question : what happens dynamically when either @xmath138 or @xmath136 ? intuitively we would expect that if @xmath159 ( @xmath138 ) , the radius of the loop would rapidly expand introducing a non - zero @xmath19 term for @xmath160 .",
    "we still have that @xmath143 .",
    "if this were not the case then the energy minimisation condition ( [ eq : energymin1 ] ) would itself be different . ]",
    "physically this corresponds to the conversion of kinetic energy from the motion of the string in the compact space , into rest - mass energy in four dimensions .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum also suggests that any fraction of @xmath133 lost in this process ( whatever this proportion may be ) is carried away by the gravitational radiation produced by the the expanding loop , though as a first approximation we may neglect this . hence we must allow for the most general case by including the explicitly time - dependent term @xmath161 in the expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( [ eq : constants2 ] ) , whose derivative @xmath162 we expect to be initially positive for an expanding loop ( i.e. @xmath163 ) .",
    "needless to say , we must also re - introduce a time - dependent velocity term @xmath164 for @xmath165 , whose derivative @xmath166 we expect initially to be negative in this case ( @xmath167 ) .    similarly if @xmath168 ( @xmath136 ) we expect the opposite process to occur - with rest - mass energy of the loop being converted into kinetic energy in the extra dimensions .",
    "for @xmath165 we again introduce the extra dynamical terms @xmath19 , whose derivative @xmath162 we now expect to be initially negative ( @xmath169 ) and @xmath164 whose derivative @xmath166 we now expect to be initially positive ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "again we face the possibility that a significant proportion of the initial angular momentum of the loop at the moment of formation will eventually be lost through the emission of gravitational radiation during dynamical evolution . as a first approximation however",
    ", we will assume the loss of angular momentum via gravitational wave emission to be negligible , taking @xmath171 .",
    "we will also assume that the total energy lost via gravitational wave emission during the dynamical evolution of the loop is negligible i.e. that @xmath172 .",
    "what drives the evolution in this case is not changes in the energy of the system to `` match '' the conditions , but changes in the conditions to match the given energy : that is , the mutual and inter - dependent evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath173 toward a loop configuration which meets the energy minimisation criteria ( [ eq : energymin1])-([eq : energymin2 ] ) .",
    "the approach outlined above has the added advantage that in both cases we may assume that the number of windings remains fixed . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "the stability of the extra - dimensional windings places a lower bound on the value of @xmath9 . if @xmath9 remains constant",
    ", all that is required to ensure stability of the windings throughout dynamical evolution towards the minimum energy state is that the string have sufficient angular momentum to stabilise its windings _ at the moment of loop creation_. in the next section we will demonstrate ( following the analysis in @xcite ) that the stabilisation of windings places a bound on @xmath9 , with more windings requiring a larger angular momentum to remain stable . thus we see that , if the value of @xmath9 were to change significantly during the evolution process , the dynamics of the loop may be considerably more complicated with windings `` falling off '' the @xmath6 as the loop expands / contracts .",
    "we now investigate the stability requirements for the extra - dimensional windings ( as mentioned above ) both generically and in light of our specific dynamical model .",
    "happily we find that the rate of winding production in the model we have put forward ensures the stability of the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz])-([eq : psi , theta , phi ] ) at the moment of loop creation for all possible formation times @xmath12 .",
    "we then leave this result on one side and consider the loop dynamics in each of the two different regimes ( @xmath159 , @xmath138 and @xmath174 , @xmath136 ) discussed above on the assumption that the loops retain their windings during the evolution towards an energy - minimising state , which is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath175 for all @xmath165 . by introducing a small perturbation in one of the bulk - space directions perpendicular to the @xmath6 it is possible to show , from the resulting expansion for the ten - dimensional action , that the string configuration ( [ eq : ansatz])-([eq : psi , theta , phi ] ) is stable @xcite ( this corresponds to moving the entire string `` up '' from the very bottom of the throat by a small amount ) .",
    "the ansatz ( [ eq : psi , theta , phi ] ) ( with @xmath176 ) also implicitly assumes that the motion of the string in the compact space is parallel to the direction of the windings , so it is not physically meaningful to perturb the string in either the @xmath36 or @xmath38-directions .",
    "we may however investigate the effect of perturbing the string in the @xmath37-direction in order to determine the stability of the winding configuration . turning on a small perturbation @xmath177",
    "then results in the following perturbation of the lagrangian @xcite @xmath178 which results in the stability condition @xmath179 in other words , the total angular momentum must satisfy this bound ( note also the _ strictness _ of the inequality ) in order for the number of windings @xmath180 to remain stable . again identifying @xmath141 and substituting for @xmath82 ( [ eq : n2 ] ) and @xmath133 ( [ eq : constants_dynamical ] ) , we may investigate the stability of the windings in our dynamical model _ at the moment of loop formation_. the resulting condition simply reduces to , @xmath181 which is automatically satisfied by the definition of @xmath17 in the klebanov - strassler geometry .",
    "thus we see that the stability condition is satisfied and that _ all _ windings are stable at the time of loop formation for _ all _ @xmath12 and for all physical values of @xmath17 , @xmath182 and @xmath11 .",
    "we now introduce a non - zero time dependent term @xmath19 for @xmath165 in ( [ eq : constants2 ] ) which initially satisfies , @xmath183 and a time - dependent velocity term @xmath184 which initially satisfies , @xmath185 and which also satisfy the following boundary conditions , in the limit @xmath186 , @xmath187 from now on then we may assume that the number of windings remains constant from the moment of loop formation , @xmath188 , and attempt to determine the corresponding dynamical evolution of the loop in the minkowski directions .",
    "using @xmath175 and @xmath189 we then have @xmath190 and @xmath191 re - arranging ( @xmath192 ) then gives , @xmath193 and re - arranging ( @xmath194 ) gives , @xmath195}{(\\alpha t_i)^2}\\ ] ] so that equating the two expressions above yields the following non - linear first order differential equation in @xmath13 ) or ( [ eq : s_dot_from_l ] ) into the original string action ( [ eq : action2 ] ) and then determine the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "the resulting equations must necessarily have the same solution as ( [ eq : ode_in_r ] ) but the method adopted here which utilises the string constants of motion is far simpler . ]",
    "@xmath196 we note that the constant terms involving @xmath17 and the terms involving powers of @xmath123 form a perfect square , so that this equation may be re - written as , @xmath197 it is then explicitly clear that there exist two critical values of @xmath123 at which @xmath119 i.e. at which the expansion of the loop ( at least momentarily ) comes to a halt . these are , @xmath198 and @xmath199 although it is not possible to show this directly without the explicit form of the solution @xmath13 , we know that the first of these values must correspond to the boundary condition @xmath143 which we imposed when calculating @xmath200 and @xmath133 , as well as when determining the energy - minimisation conditions ( [ eq : energymin1])-([eq : energymin2 ] )",
    ". however the second of these values is intriguing as it does _ not _ correspond to the minimum energy condition .",
    "we can tell immediately therefore that the dynamical evolution of the loop will not lead to a steady energy - minimising state , and we may may instead expect a solution which oscillates between the two values @xmath201 ( the initial radius of the loop ) and @xmath202 .    to see",
    "if such a solution is consistent with the physical arguments above i.e that a value of @xmath138 leads to an _ initially _ expanding loop , @xmath136 leads to an _ initially _ contracting loop and that @xmath203 leads to a static loop of radius @xmath204 , we must now ask two questions .",

    "the second question may be answered as follows : by equating our expression for @xmath133 ( [ eq : constants_general ] ) with the second part of the energy - minimisation conditions ( [ eq : energymin2 ] ) , we see that the critical radius corresponding to the fulfillment of this condition @xmath212 may be written in terms of @xmath17 and the initial radius @xmath213 such that , @xmath214 whether @xmath215 then depends on whether @xmath216 which is equivalent to the condition @xmath217 and reduces to @xmath218 .",

    "we have argued that a velocity correlations regime in the post - inflationary epoch leads naturally to the formation of string loops with geodesic windings in the compact space . for strings at the tip of the conifold throat of the klebanov - strassler geometry",
    "we were able to show that the quantities which determine the dynamical evolution of the loop ( i.e. the initial winding number @xmath82 , energy @xmath200 and string velocity / angular momentum in the compact space , @xmath277/ @xmath133 ) are _ uniquely _ determined by the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . crucially these windings were found to have sufficient angular momentum in the compact directions to remain stable , even after the string chops off from the network to form a loop .",
    "the interaction between the tension and the angular momentum in the compact space was found to play a significant role in the dynamical evolution of the string , including - perhaps surprisingly - the evolution in four dimensions . by assuming energy loss ( and angular momentum ) via gravitational radiation to be negligible , we determined equations of motion for the four - dimensional radius @xmath13 and the string velocity @xmath271 , which we believe to be valid over small time scales after the moment of loop formation , @xmath278 .",
    "we found that the qualitative behaviour of the string depends crucially on the square of the warp factor , @xmath231 , with @xmath14 leading to an oscillatory solution characterised by an initial phase of expansion , whilst @xmath15 leads to oscillations with an initial contracting phase . in each case",
    "the string was seen to oscillate between it s initial radius @xmath213 and a secondary critical value defined by @xmath279 , with the period of oscillation given by @xmath280 .    as noted above , in the two oscillatory regimes",
    "it is the interaction of the angular momentum with the string tension which `` drives '' the dynamical evolution converting kinetic energy into rest mass during expansion ( with the inverse process occurring in the contracting phase ) .",
    "the string is seen to evolve _ towards _ a static , minimum energy configuration where @xmath281 and @xmath282 , but is unable to satisfy these two conditions simultaneously at a point where @xmath283 .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath284 scenario we find that the energy minimising conditions _ are _ satisfied simultaneously at the moment of loop formation . in this case",
    "the tension exactly offsets the effect of angular momentum so that the string remains static at it s original radius @xmath213 and is non - oscillatory .",
    "the meaning of the term `` small '' above is somewhat ambiguous , but it seems reasonable to assume that our solution will provide a valid approximation over at least one full oscillatory cycle of the loop ; that is , over a time period @xmath285 . for time periods",
    "@xmath286 our initial analysis must be extended to include the effects of gravitational wave emission on @xmath287 and @xmath288 ( or equivalently on @xmath13 and @xmath173 ) .",
    "we may expect the qualitative effect of energy and angular momentum loss to be relatively simple , as long as the string retains sufficient angular momentum for the extra - dimensional windings to remain stable . in this case",
    "it is likely that the loss of @xmath8 and @xmath9 due to gravitational wave emission will simply act to damp the oscillations of @xmath13 and @xmath173 .",
    "what is unclear however is whether or not the damping coefficient itself is likely to be time - dependent ; for example , it is possible that smaller oscillations lead to greater rates of emission per unit length ( as the rate of acceleration @xmath162 is higher in this case ) so that the damping itself increases with time ( for an individual loop ) .    in the case",
    "that the windings eventually become unstable however ( as @xmath288 drops below the threshold for ensuring their stability ) the string dynamics are likely to become complicated , and it is not clear whether the process of winding contraction ( i.e. of windings `` falling off '' the @xmath6 ) may even be accommodated within an analysis which uses an ansatz of the form ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) to describe the string configuration .",
    "this is because the coordinates @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath91 are treated as _",
    "independent _ variables with respect to the determination of the equations of motion .",
    "we are therefore unable to take account of the continuously connected nature of the string when string sections `` move '' from one direction to another ( e.g. in `` falling off '' the @xmath6 to form part of the four dimensional rest mass of the loop ) .",
    "the present analysis could of course still be improved by accounting for the effects of gravitational wave emission under the assumption that that loops retain their windings , which would indeed be valid up to the point where @xmath288 drops below the critical value ( which may also be calculated ) .",
    "such an improved analysis could proceed as follows : one could compute the stress energy tensor for an oscillating loop and look for solutions with this as a source to the einstein equations .",
    "this should allow us to estimate the rate of loss of @xmath8 and @xmath9 via gravitational wave emission and , as stated , we expect this to produce a damping term in the equations for @xmath13 and @xmath173",
    ".    calculating the emission spectrum for an oscillating loop would also be of immense practical interest .",
    "the gravitational wave signature of such a loop , whose self - oscillation is caused by the presence of angular momentum in the compact space , may differ significantly from that of a string whose oscillations , though superficially similar , do not result from self - interaction . gravitational wave emission from loops oscillating with period @xmath293 ( where @xmath294 is the loop size ) have been intensively studied in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "however in such cases the loop is not undergoing _ genuine _ phases of expansion and contraction , but rather experiencing `` wiggles '' of a size comparable to it s own length .",
    "although weinberg @xcite has has shown that - in an frw universe - the power of a weak , isolated , periodic source ( to lowest order in @xmath295 ) may be given by a single formula _",
    "regardless _ of the exact nature of the source , it is not immediately clear that this should hold in extra - dimensional scenarios . additionally such sources ( i.e. loops ) have no angular momentum to shed in the process of emission .",
    "in fact even if we were to study loops whose self - oscillation was due to their `` rotational '' motion in minkowski space ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , the angular momentum which would be carried away by gravitational radiation would be very different from that lost via emission from oscillating cycloops .",
    "the detection of such a signature by the future generation gravitational wave detectors could then provide indirect evidence of the presence of compact dimensions .",
    "we hope therefore to be able to provide such an analysis in the near future .    although the full string theory compactification favours exponentially small values of @xmath17 , it is also interesting to note that the possibility of obtaining evidence from the gravitational wave signature of wound strings exists even in the case of static loops ( i.e. the @xmath16 case ) .",
    "these loops , which form automatically with a configuration which meets the energy minimising conditions , look just like ordinary string loops from a four - dimensional perspective .",
    "however they contain an `` unseen '' angular momentum which is not directly manifested in their dynamical evolution in minkowski space .",
    "as stated above , we expect that even `` standard '' four dimensional string loops may undergo periodic oscillations with @xmath293 creating ripples in space - time and giving rise to gravitational waves . such fluctuations _ along _ the length of the string - though not in the total four dimensional length itself - would likely still occur in this case ( though it is possible that the existence of the angular momentum term may lend a certain rigidity to the circular string configuration , making it more resistant to deformation ) but the string must also now shed it s angular momentum .",
    "the gravitational wave signature of even a non - self - oscillating loop in the extra - dimensional scenario is therefore also likely to differ significantly from the standard case of an un - wound string , though perhaps to a less significant degree than in the self - oscillating case .",
    "however the possibility of the indirect detection of compact dimensions from cosmic strings therefore remains , even in the absence of self - oscillating loops .",
    "we hope also to be able to offer an analysis of this interesting possibility in a future letter .",
    "it remains for us to outline some of the possible limitations of the analysis we have attempted : we have assumed throughout the present work that the velocity correlations regime leads naturally to a ) geodesic windings and b ) movement of the string parallel to itself ( i.e. along the geodesics )",
    ". however these assumptions may be questioned .",
    "the rationale for adopting such an approach ( which simplified the resulting analysis considerably ) was simple - we expect velocity correlations to impart a constant angular momentum density to each point along the string .",
    "therefore we expect each `` point '' ( or infinitesimal string segment ) to travel along a geodesic curve , both before and after loop formation .",
    "however it has not been proved that each point along the string traversing a separate geodesic , leads to a winding configuration that is itself geodesic .",
    "likewise it does not necessarily follow that the resulting motion of the string as a whole is parallel to itself .",
    "in general , we may expect that the geometry of the internal space plays a role in determining the exact nature of the winding configuration and the resulting string motion .",
    "moreover we have not included the contribution from the ramond - ramond ( rr ) sector , which in principle will couple to the string .",
    "this charge term is ultimately crucial for distinguishing between cosmic strings and cosmic super - strings .",
    "whilst , in principle , motion of the string perpendicular to its length may easily be accounted for ( see end of appendix ii ) the most significant problem in the analysis of string loops with non - geodesic windings arises from the resulting @xmath43-dependence of the expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we believe that the present analysis may therefore be improved by a more thorough investigation of the winding process itself , and though we expect our expressions for @xmath82 ( [ eq : n2 ] ) and @xmath296 ( [ eq : omega_l_v ] ) to remain valid ( in the ks case ) , the appropriate string ansatz may well be more complicated .",
    "although it seems unlikely that the qualitative behaviour of the string will differ significantly than described in the scenarios above , finding analogous ( and _ quantitatively _ different ) results may be extremely difficult .",
    "but ultimately exact _ quantitative _ predictions will be needed for any comparison with future experimental data , and we believe such a project to be worthwhile .    * acknowledgments *    m.l is supported by an stfc studentship and the queen mary epstar consortium .",

    "as noted previously , the quadratic equation in the integral defined by ( [ eq : integral ] ) and ( [ eq : abc ] ) has a discriminant @xmath233 which is everywhere non - negative for values of @xmath17 in the range @xmath25",

    "again we follow iglesias @xcite in choosing @xmath321 in order to simplify the metric as much as possible .",
    "it is of course also necessary to re - scale the metric so that @xmath322 as we are dealing with a physical @xmath6 of radius @xmath26 .",
    "let us now consider an arbitrary string embedding which is a function of both space and time , @xmath323 where @xmath324 .",
    "the general - coordinate independent - expression for the string lagrangian is then , @xmath325 where @xmath326 where a dash indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath43 and a dot represents differentiation with respect to @xmath236 as usual . in the static case",
    "the term @xmath327 corresponds simply to the length of the wrapped string on the @xmath6 . demanding that @xmath328 one simply obtains the geodesic equation , @xmath329 where @xmath330 are the usual christoffel symbols .",
    "thus minimal ( i.e. geodesic ) windings on a general manifold ( in our case this is just @xmath6 ) with metric @xmath331 is enough to guarantee @xmath43 independence of the winding terms .",
    "the same statement still holds true if we allow time - dependence into the string ansatz , @xmath332 , as long as for each instant in time the latter still satisfies the geodesic equation .",
    "physically this means that the wrapped loop only ever evolves along geodesic curves . a simple example on the @xmath21 would be a great circle passing through the north and south poles and rotating about an axis through the poles .",
    "thus we require our embedding function to satisfy , @xmath333 now , with time - dependence we also have a non - zero kinetic energy term of the wrapped string inside the square root factor in our lagrangian , @xmath334 demanding now that @xmath335 we find , @xmath336 geometrically this equation states that the velocity vector , @xmath337 , is preserved under parallel transport along a geodesic curve that is wrapped by the string .",
    "one can equally interpret this equation as saying that under parallel transport of the tangent vector to the geodesic curve , @xmath338 , along a curve whose tangent vector is @xmath337 , the former is preserved .",
    "mathematically this is simply the statement that @xmath339 .",
    "the nice consequence of demanding the above is that that the winding term is not only @xmath43 independent ( if we take geodesic wrapping ) but also time independent , i.e. @xmath340 . thus @xmath43 independence of the kinetic function @xmath341 guarantees time independence of @xmath342 .",
    "this is an important statement .",
    "let us now consider what the situation above implies for the case where the wrapping is over flat sub - manifolds as in the case of iglesias , where the @xmath330 all vanish . the geodesic equation ( [ geod ] ) and ( [ preserv ] ) trivially imply @xmath343 , and therefore the solution of these equations is , @xmath344 this provides the origin of the linear @xmath43 anasatz of iglesias . now",
    "apart from the winding and kinetic terms mentioned above there are additionally the two @xmath345 terms appearing inside the square root in the lagrangian in @xmath346 .",

    "one sees that @xmath348 vanishes identically .",
    "however what is important is that @xmath43 independence of all the relevant terms in the lagrangian is guaranteed simply by requiring the strings to wrap geodesics and that the velocity vector is preserved under parallel transport along this geodesic .",
    "thus we see that @xmath44 as stated in the introduction .",
    "we now have the possibility of working in _ any _ coordinate system , though the choice of explicit string wrapping ansatz is constrained by the requirement of solving ( [ geod ] ) , ( [ preserv ] ) _ if _ we require geodesic windings .",
    "in general explicit solutions to the geodesic equations are hard to come by but for very symmetric spaces - like spheres - they are known . however , the ansatz will certainly never be linear in @xmath43 and nor will the @xmath43 and time dependence factorize in an additive way as it did in the flat space case , no matter what choice of coordinates we make . ]",
    "however let us now compare the form of these explicit solutions , in canonical coordinates , to the simple linear ansatz in ( [ eq : appendix_linear_ansatz ] ) . in order to determine the appropriate ansatz for geodesic windings in canonical coordinates we must first calculate the killing vectors in this coordinate system .",
    "we know that the killing fields corresponding to the @xmath85 rotations of the @xmath6 generate isometries of the above metric - therefore , if we think of the @xmath6 as being embedded in @xmath345 where @xmath349 represent the four cartesian coordinates , @xmath350 the three independent isometries are generated by @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the generator of rotations in the @xmath353 plane etc .",

    "the above makes sense because it is known that flows of the killing vector fields on @xmath356 induced by rigid @xmath85 rotations are actually geodesics .",
    "so our wrapping ansatz would be guaranteed to be minimal in the same sense that the linear ansatz of iglesias for winding around the torus - because again the flows of the killing vectors in that case are geodesic circles around the torus .",
    "notice that in equation ( [ static ] ) we have written the expression for @xmath377 and not @xmath378 .",
    "the latter can be obtained in principle by integration . in the simple case where the killing vectors are coordinate independent",
    "( e.g. abelian isometries , shift isometries ) , integration directly gives us @xmath379 which we found in the case of flat sub - manifolds discussed earlier .",
    "the @xmath85 killing vectors however are not constant , so integration is non - trivial and will lead to non - linear dependence on @xmath380 in general .",
    "it is a general result that if a killing vector field has constant length , then it will generate geodesics along the manifold . in our case we know that the @xmath381 have unit length with respect to the canonical metric on the @xmath6",
    ". therefore we can be sure that equation ( [ geod ] ) will be solved by @xmath382 on the three sphere according to the ansatz in ( [ static ] ) .",
    "one can see this more clearly by taking the normalisation constraint @xmath383 and differentiating this with respect to some arbitrary vector field @xmath384 .",
    "the resultant killing equation gives us @xmath385 , which more generally implies @xmath386 which is just the restatement that @xmath387 is a geodesic .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of such an embedding we now need to extend our solution to incorporate time dependence .",
    "this means that we need to preserve the geodesics under time evolution . to ensure this ,",
    "let us use the @xmath85 transformations , since these are isometries preserving the canonical metric , and therefore we map geodesics to geodesics . the modified ansatz for the embedding functions should now read @xmath388 where we have introduced new variables @xmath389 . the string modes will therefore be wrapped along any curve defined by @xmath390 , and this curve will then evolve in time via the second geodesic equation ( with tangent vector @xmath391 ) .",
    "this means that the functions in the action will take a simplified form @xmath392 which are both constant , and @xmath393 is related to the average speed of the string along the @xmath6 .",
    "now it @xmath394 and @xmath393 are such that the @xmath338 and @xmath337 are parallel , then the dangerous @xmath345 terms will vanish from the action .",
    "if these vectors are not parallel then there is no cancellation , which means that the wrapped geodesic must have a perpendicular component along the winding direction satisfying @xmath395 .",
    "how does this affect the resultant action constructed in equation ( [ generalaction ] ) ? we can define a unit vector pointing parallel to the winding direction in the usual manner .",
    "this therefore allows us to split the velocity into components @xmath396 . after some manipulation we find that the lagrangian simplifies to give @xmath397 where the @xmath345 terms have canceled as already advertised",
    "physically this makes sense , since the perpendicular modes lie in the normal bundle and therefore contribute to the transverse boost of the string , much like the velocity in the minkowski directions .",
    "the net effect is an enhancement of the relativistic gamma factor .    in the simplest case where we neglect the transverse modes",
    ", we see that the resultant energy and momentum become @xmath398 where we have defined @xmath9 in the same manner as iglesias @xmath399 for the case where there is no velocity in the minkowski direction , we can write the energy as a function of @xmath9 and minimise it to obtain @xmath400 which is the generalisation of the @xmath401 dependence obtained in iglesias .",
    "moreover the velocity at the minimal radius is given by @xmath402 generally we should consider the case where there is non - zero @xmath403 , we will see that solutions that minimise the energy whilst having non - zero @xmath9 _ require _ us to set @xmath404 - which is easily understood since non - zero velocity in these directions only ever increases the energy through enhancement of the gamma factor .",
