    "the astrophysical @xmath0-process  is considered to be responsible for the nucleosynthesis of about one half of the nuclei heavier than iron . in a classical view , under the extremely neutron - rich @xmath0-process  conditions with neutron densities above @xmath10/@xmath11 , matter is driven towards neutron - rich nuclei by ( n,@xmath1 )  reactions .",
    "an equilibrium is established between ( n,@xmath1 )  and ( @xmath1,n )  reactions for nuclei with low neutron binding energies of the order of a few mev . here",
    "the @xmath0-process  flow has to wait for the much slower @xmath3-decay to proceed towards nuclei with larger z ( `` waiting - point approximation '' ) @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the extreme conditions for the @xmath0-process  can only be achieved in explosive scenarios .",
    "however , the astrophysical site(s ) of the @xmath0-process  are still under debate .",
    "the present study focuses onto the particular conditions which are found in neutrino - driven winds above a nascent neutron star or after the merging of two neutron stars . here light",
    "@xmath0-process  elements may be formed at high temperatures in a very short timescale of the order of milliseconds . under these conditions",
    "the @xmath3-decays may be too slow , and thus nuclei with larger @xmath2 can also be produced in a different way ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the best candidate",
    "are @xmath4-induced reactions in the so - called @xmath4-process .",
    "these reactions are often somewhat simplistic discussed as ( @xmath4,n )  reactions .",
    "however , the following analysis will show that not only the ( @xmath4,1n ) , but also ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  reactions may contribute , and that the flow towards nuclei with larger @xmath2 is governed by the total @xmath4-induced reaction cross section @xmath12 .",
    "very recently , a sensitivity study on the theoretical uncertainties of ( @xmath4,n )  reactions has been published by pereira and montes @xcite .",
    "for the example of the @xmath8se(@xmath4,n)@xmath13kr  reaction it was shown in @xcite that the ( @xmath4,1n )  reaction rate is uncertain by at least an order of magnitude at low temperatures below @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 being the temperature in @xmath16k ) which is mainly based on the uncertainty which results from the choice of the @xmath4-nucleus potential . at higher temperatures above @xmath17 the uncertainty from the chosen @xmath4-nucleus potential reduces to about a factor of two to three , and the other ingredients of the statistical model calculations lead to similar uncertainties ( see fig .  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is noticed in @xcite that the widely used code non - smoker @xcite provides inclusive ( @xmath4,n )  cross sections and rates , whereas the open - source code talys @xcite calculates also exclusive ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  cross sections and rates .",
    "it is shown for the chosen example of @xmath8se  that the ( @xmath4,1n )  rate dominates at temperatures below @xmath18 , whereas above @xmath19 the ( @xmath4,2n )  rate exceeds the ( @xmath4,1n )  rate significantly ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath8se  is an unstable neutron - rich nucleus four mass units `` east '' of the heaviest stable selenium isotope @xmath20se , the measurement of @xmath4-induced cross sections for @xmath8se  is extremely difficult , and up to now experimental data are not available .",
    "the present study fully agrees with the discussion of the astrophysical scenario in @xcite and the conclusion on the importance of the @xmath4-nucleus potential .",
    "in addition to @xcite , this work attempts to provide a better understanding of the uncertainties of @xmath4-induced reaction rates for the given astrophysical @xmath4-process  scenario . for this purpose",
    "the following questions have to be addressed .",
    "( @xmath21 ) what is the astrophysically relevant quantity ? ( @xmath22 ) how does this quantity depend on the underlying ingredients of the statistical model ? ( @xmath23 ) is there a deeper understanding of the corresponding nuclear physics ?",
    "these questions will be answered in the following .",
    "for simplicity and better readability , the following discussion uses the example of @xmath8se  which was also chosen in @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite that the ( n,@xmath1 )  and ( @xmath1,n )  reactions are faster than other reactions by several orders of magnitude , thus leading to an equilibrium isotopic distribution ( e.g. , within the selenium isotopic chain ) which is a function of temperature and neutron density .",
    "let us assume that this isotopic distribution peaks at @xmath8se .",
    "following the approximation given in eq .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite , this corresponds e.g.  to @xmath26 and @xmath27/@xmath11 .",
    "then the flow towards larger @xmath2 may proceed via @xmath8se(@xmath4,1n)@xmath13kr , or in general via @xmath8se(@xmath4,@xmath7n)@xmath28kr ( with @xmath29 ) .",
    "even the case @xmath30 , i.e.  the @xmath8se(@xmath4,@xmath1)@xmath31kr reaction , may contribute although the ( @xmath4,@xmath1 )  cross section is typically much smaller than the ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  cross sections .",
    "as soon as any krypton isotope is made in this way , the fast ( n,@xmath1 )  and ( @xmath1,n )  reactions drive krypton immediately towards @xmath31kr which has a similar neutron separation energy as @xmath8se .",
    "this conclusion is completely independent of the production by ( @xmath4,1n )  or ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  reactions , i.e.  independent whether krypton is made as @xmath8kr or @xmath31kr . in general , ( n,@xmath1 )  rates increase with increasing positive ( n,@xmath1 )  @xmath32-value towards less neutron - rich nuclei , i.e.  towards stability .",
    "thus , e.g.  @xmath8kr from the @xmath8se(@xmath4,4n)@xmath8kr reaction is very efficiently transmuted to @xmath31kr by a fast series of ( n,@xmath1 )  reactions .    from the above arguments it becomes evident that the astrophysically relevant quantity is the total production of kr isotopes by ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  reactions , i.e.  the sum over ( @xmath4,1n ) , ( @xmath4,2n ) , ( @xmath4,3n ) , etc .  including also the weak ( @xmath4,@xmath1 )  cross section .",
    "for the typical temperatures of the @xmath4-process  @xcite , the total reaction cross section for the chosen example of @xmath8se  is governed by the ( @xmath4,1n )  channel .",
    "the reaction rate of the ( @xmath4,2n )  channel contributes only minor because of the negative @xmath32-value of about @xmath33mev , and the reaction rates of the ( @xmath4,3n )  and ( @xmath4,4n )  channels are practically negligible .",
    "the total reaction cross section @xmath12  of @xmath4-induced reactions is given by the sum over all open reaction channels .",
    "in the case of neutron - rich nuclei , any proton emission is highly suppressed because of the negative @xmath32-value . in the given example of @xmath8se  the @xmath32-value of the ( @xmath4,@xmath34 )",
    "reaction is about @xmath35mev , and thus the astrophysical reaction rate @xmath36@xmath37  of the ( @xmath4,@xmath34 )  reaction remains negligibly small . as a consequence , the total reaction cross section @xmath12  is practically identical to the sum over the cross sections of the neutron - emitting ( @xmath4,@xmath7n )  channels which has been identified as the astrophysically relevant quantity in the previous sect .",

    "an extended network with the inclusive ( @xmath4,n )  rate ( e.g.  from non - smoker ) for the exclusive ( @xmath4,1n )  channel is not fully correct , but the ( n,@xmath1)-(@xmath1,n )  equilibrium will keep the resulting error relatively small .",

    "<S> background : :    the astrophysical @xmath0-process occurs in an explosive    astrophysical event under extremely neutron - rich conditions , leading    to ( n,@xmath1)-(@xmath1,n ) equilibrium along    isotopic chains which peaks around neutron separation energies of a    few mev . </S>",
    "<S> nuclei with larger @xmath2 are usually produced by    @xmath3-decay , but under certain conditions also    @xmath4-induced reactions may become relevant for the    production of nuclei with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    the uncertainties of the reaction rates of these    @xmath4-induced reactions are discussed within the    statistical model . as an example , @xmath4-induced    ( @xmath4,n ) and @xmath6,@xmath7n )    reaction cross sections for the neutron - rich @xmath8se    nucleus are studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    in a first step , the relevance of ( @xmath4,n ) and    @xmath6,@xmath7n ) reactions is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> next    the uncertainties are determined from a variation of the    @xmath4-nucleus potential which is the all - dominant    parameter for the astrophysical @xmath9    reaction rate . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    it is found that the @xmath0-process flow towards nuclei with    larger @xmath2 is essentially influenced only by the    @xmath4-nucleus potential whereas the other ingredients    of the statistical model play a very minor role . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is based    on the fact that the flow towards larger @xmath2 depends on    the sum over all ( @xmath4,@xmath7n ) cross    sections which is practically identical to the total    @xmath4-induced reaction cross section . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    @xmath4-nucleus potentials play an important role under    certain @xmath0-process conditions because the flow towards    larger @xmath2 depends sensitively on the total    @xmath4-induced reaction cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty    of the reaction rate is about a factor of two to three at higher    temperatures and exceeds one order of magnitude at very low    temperatures . </S>"
