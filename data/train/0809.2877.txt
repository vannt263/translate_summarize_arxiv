    "studies of phase transitions have traditionally focused on _ equilibrium _ scalings of various properties near the critical point of a _ homogeneous _ system .",
    "the dynamics of phase transitions presents new interdisciplinary challenges .",
    "nonequilibrium phase transitions may play a role in the evolution of the early universe @xcite .",
    "their analogues can be studied in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the latter observation led to the series of beautiful experiments @xcite ( see @xcite for an up - to - date review ) and to the development of the theory based on the universality of critical behavior @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in cold atom experiments allows for the temporal and spatial control of different systems undergoing a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite .",
    "these experimental developments call for an in - depth understanding of non - equilibrium qpts .",
    "a qpt is a fundamental change in the _ ground state _ of the system as a result of small variations of an external parameter , e.g. , a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in contrast to thermodynamic phase transitions , it takes place ideally at temperature of absolute zero .    the problem of how a quantum system undergoes a transition from one quantum phase to another due to time - dependent ( temporal ) driving has attracted lots of attention lately @xcite .",
    "basic insights into the qpt dynamics can be obtained through the quantum version @xcite of the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) @xcite .",
    "the kzm recognizes that the time evolution of the quantum system is adiabatic far away from the critical point where the gap in the excitation spectrum is large .",
    "the system adjusts to all changes imposed on its hamiltonian . near the critical point",
    ", however , the gap closes precluding the adiabatic evolution and resulting in the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "this switch of behavior happens when the system reaction time @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is excitation gap ) becomes comparable to the time scale on which the critical point is approached , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the parameter driving the transition , @xmath6 is the location of the critical point ) .",
    "this brings us to @xmath7 to solve ( [ gap_eq ] ) we define @xmath8 .",
    "the solution of ( [ gap_eq ] ) gives us time @xmath9 , left to reaching the critical point , when the non - equilibrium dynamics starts @xmath10 above we have set @xmath11 near the critical point ( @xmath12 and @xmath0 are critical exponents ) .",
    "the quantum kzm proposes that the non - equilibrium evolution in the neighborhood of the critical point is to a first approximation impulse ( diabatic ) : the state of the system does not change there .",
    "suppose that the system evolves towards the critical point from the ground state far away from it .",
    "thus its properties near the critical point are determined by its ground state properties at a distance @xmath13 from the critical point ( the adiabatic regime was abandoned there ) .",
    "as have been shown in spin models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ferromagnetic spin-1 bose - einstein condensates @xcite , this simplification allows for a correct analytical computation of the density of excitations resulting from the non - equilibrium quench .    in this paper",
    "we study a quantum phase transition induced by _",
    "spacial _ rather than temporal driving .",
    "it means that the driving parameter , @xmath5 , depends on position and is independent of time .",
    "such a transition was recently studied in the quantum ising model @xcite and the mean - field ginzburg - landau theory @xcite .",
    "here we present the theory of the spatial quench in a ferromagnetic spin-1 bose - einstein condensate , which is one of the most flexible physical systems for studies of qpts .",
    "we focus on the ground state . in the simplest approximation , the local homogeneous approximation ( lha ) ,",
    "the system is locally characterized by its homogeneous ground state properties perfectly tracking spatial variations of @xmath5 .",
    "this approximation is good far enough from the critical point , where the healing length @xcite is small compared to the imposed scale of spatial driving . using the time quench analogy",
    ", the system evolves perfectly adiabatically in space away from the spatial critical point , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .    around the critical point",
    ", however , the healing length diverges and so the lha breaks down .",
    "the system enters `` non - equilibrium '' regime similarly as during a time quench . the spatial coupling term in the hamiltonian ( a gradient term in mean - field theories , a spin - spin interaction term in spin models ) smoothes out the sharp spatial boundary between the phases predicted by the lha .",
    "even more interestingly , these similarities are not only qualitative @xcite .",
    "the distance from the spatial critical point where the switch between the two regimes takes place , @xmath16 , can be determined by looking at the length scales relevant for the spatial quench .",
    "we compare the healing length @xmath17 to the length scale on which the spatial critical point is approached : @xmath18 assuming that @xmath4 changes in @xmath19-direction only .",
    "this brings us to the spatial analog of ( [ gap_eq ] ) @xmath20 to solve ( [ gapx_eq ] ) we define @xmath21 and get @xmath22 the results ( [ t_hat ] ) and ( [ x_hat ] ) are analogous . indeed , apart from a slight difference in the scaling exponents  due to the absence of @xmath12 in ( [ x_hat ] ) ",
    "@xmath9 maps onto @xmath16 when time scales @xmath23 and @xmath24 are replaced by length scales @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this shows striking parallels between quenches in time and space .",
    "it is also instructive to note that the same general result , eq .",

    "the constant @xmath32 is the s - wave scattering length in the total spin @xmath33 channel ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is the atom mass .",
    "the prefactors of linear and quadratic zeeman shifts are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "there @xmath39 is the hyperfine splitting energy .",

    "the spin conservation ensures that the final and initial states will have the same total @xmath53 magnetization : @xmath51 . additionally , we consider @xmath54 in the ground state : a condition that can be always imposed because @xmath55\\ge   { \\cal e}[(|\\psi_1|,|\\psi_0|,|\\psi_{-1}| ) ] .",
    "$ ] this sets @xmath56 . moreover ,",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that @xmath57 in the spatial quench considered here .",

    "this numerical simulation is for @xmath61  see appendix [ appendix_b ] for numerical details . ]    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath62 and forgetting about the gradient term in ( [ energy ] ) ",
    "i.e. , using our lha  the ground state phase diagram can be sketched .",
    "the part of the condensate exposed to @xmath63 is in the ground state of the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "there @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the condensate is magnetized : @xmath66 , while @xmath67 .",
    "this ground state breaks rotational symmetry on the @xmath68 plane present in energy functional ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "parts of the condensate exposed to @xmath69 are in the polar phase ground state with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which implies @xmath72 .",
    "the dependence of the condensate magnetization on @xmath19 and @xmath5 in the lha is depicted with the red dashed line on fig . [",
    "smeared ] .",
    "there one condensate accommodates the two phases .",
    "the inclusion of the gradient term in the energy functional ( [ energy ] ) prohibits singularities in the first derivative of the wave function .",
    "the smooth crossover region replaces the sharp phase boundary predicted by the lha ( fig . [",
    "smeared ] ) .",
    "its size is proportional to @xmath16 ( [ x_hat ] ) , as will be carefully discussed below .    in the simplest setup @xmath73 dependence ( [ q_of_r ] )",
    "is achieved by using the static , inhomogeneous , magnetic field to drive the system between the two phases .",
    "that would correspond to the following spatial variation of the zeeman coefficients across a typical @xmath74rb condensate : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the latter result is obtained by using @xmath77 hzg@xmath78 , @xmath79 hzg@xmath80 @xcite , and @xmath81 ( evaluated at a peak density of the berkeley experiment @xcite ) . as can be found numerically",
    ", such an abrupt @xmath82-variation makes the lha phase diagram qualitatively incorrect .",
    "to avoid these complications we propose to expose the condensate to the inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath83 pointing in the @xmath12-direction and changing in time faster than the characteristic time scales for the condensate dynamics . when @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes time average , the linear zeeman shift will be wiped out ( which we assume from now on ) , while the quadratic term will be position - dependent only : @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we are still dealing with a phase transition in space .    to make use of",
    "the general predictions worked out in ( [ x_hat ] ) , we have to determine the value of the critical exponent @xmath0 and the prefactor @xmath25 from the generic expression for the healing length ( [ heal ] ) .",
    "we do it by comparing ( [ heal ] ) to the expression for a divergent healing length near the critical point ( [ healing_l ] ) , which we have derived in appendix [ appendix_a ]",
    ". we get that @xmath87 on both sides of the qpt . introducing a constant @xmath88 we also see from ( [ healing_l ] ) that @xmath25 equals @xmath89 in the polar phase and @xmath90 in the broken - symmetry phase .    .",
    "the green line presents the curve @xmath91 .",
    "the red crosses and circles show numerics for @xmath16 on the broken - symmetry side of the qpt .",
    "the blue line presents power law @xmath92 , that was obtained from the fit @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a unit of length ( see appendix [ appendix_b ] ) .",
    "the fit was done to data in the range of @xmath95  red crosses .",
    "red circles show numerical data that was not used for this fit .",
    "the determination of @xmath16 is illustrated on the inset showing the data for @xmath61 : @xmath16 is the distance from the critical point where the relative departures of the condensate magnetization from the lha result , @xmath96 , start to exceed @xmath97 ( other thresholds , @xmath98 , give a similar result ) .",
    "note logarithmic scale on both axis . ]",
    "coming back to ( [ x_hat ] ) we get that the size of the crossover region on either the polar or the broken - symmetry side is @xmath99 this expression can be verified by looking at experimentally measurable quantity : the ground state magnetization of the condensate @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion on the polar side and linearize the wave - function around polar phase ground state : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "this leads to @xmath103 .",
    "using position - dependent @xmath5 from ( [ q_of_r ] ) and linearized version of ( [ meanfield ] ) we arrive at @xmath104 which is solved by @xmath105 there @xmath106 is the condensate magnetization at the spatial critical point ( it depends on @xmath26 only ) , @xmath107 is the distance from the spatial critical point , and @xmath108 is an airy function  the only nondivergent solution of ( [ dfx ] ) .",
    "this solution rigorously shows that decay of the magnetization , @xmath109 , takes place on a length scale @xmath110 in full agreement with the strikingly simple scaling result ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the polar phase , the magnetization approaches the lha value , @xmath111 , at a distance @xmath16 from the critical point .    on the broken - symmetry side of the qpt",
    ", we refer to numerics ( appendix [ appendix_b ] ) to verify accuracy of ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "in the two extreme limits , very large and very small @xmath26 the theory does not work well .",
    "indeed , using ( [ q_of_r ] ) we see that the spatial extent of the broken - symmetry phase is @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ smeared ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 , to see well the crossover region on the broken - symmetry side . in the other limit , large @xmath26 , we have to take into account that the system size in numerical simulations is finite , say @xmath115 .",
    "there we need to have @xmath116 so that there will be a spatial point in our system where @xmath117 , and the finite size corrections coming from proximity of the system boundary to the spatial critical point will be negligible . these two estimates tell us that @xmath26 in our system shall be much larger than @xmath118 and much smaller than @xmath119 ( see appendix [ appendix_b ] for numerical value of @xmath115 , @xmath120 and the unit of length @xmath94 relevant for our simulations ) . increasing ( decreasing ) the lower ( upper ) limit on @xmath26 by a factor of five we fit a power law to @xmath95 .",
    "we get from a fit that @xmath93  see fig . [ plot_scaling ] .",
    "the numerical data for @xmath16 clearly departs from the fitted line for @xmath121 .",
    "departures for @xmath122 are much less pronounced .",
    "therefore , we get approximately that @xmath123 , which is in good qualitative agreement with the predicted scaling , i.e. , @xmath124 .",
    "we expect that better agreement can be obtained for large systems where we can explore larger @xmath26 s for which crossover region is closer to the critical point ( @xmath125 ) . more precisely , by taking the limit of @xmath126 at @xmath127 ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) we expect that the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) will be fully recovered from numerical simulations .",
    "now let s focus on the magnetization at the critical point . from ( [ ai ] )",
    "we know that it scales in the same way as the condensate magnetization at the border of the crossover region in the polar phase ( @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 assuming that similar scaling relation will also hold between @xmath106 and @xmath131 at @xmath132 , i.e. , at the broken - symmetry phase border of the crossover region where @xmath133 we get that @xmath134 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ plot_scaling ] , we have indeed a robust @xmath134 scaling for @xmath135 in the large range of @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the above intuitive prediction of the @xmath106 scaling matches numerics so well .",
    "it suggests that magnetization at the spatial critical point might be a robust observable for studies of spatial quenches .",
    "similar observation was made for condensate magnetization at the critical point during a temporal quench from the broken - symmetry to the polar phase @xcite .",
    "all these results are in qualitative agreement with our expectations : in the limit of large @xmath26  very slow spatial driving  the condensate ground state approaches the lha .",
    "indeed , both the size of the crossover region in the @xmath5-parameter space , @xmath138 , and the condensate magnetization at the critical point , @xmath139 , go to zero as @xmath26 increases .",
    "the measurements of the dependence of the size of crossover region on @xmath26 should allow for the first experimental determination of the scaling exponent @xmath0 in a ferromagnetic spin-1 bose - einstein condensate .",
    "thus , our considerations lead to the new way of investigating the critical region of phase transitions .",
    "another scheme that can be used to determine the exponent @xmath0 was explored experimentally by esslinger s group in the context of the classical phase transition from a normal gas to a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the setup involved in this experiment is quite complicated as it requires presence of a high finesse optical cavity for detection purposes .",
    "we expect that the approach proposed by us should be easier to implement in the context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "moreover , according to ( [ x_hat ] ) our scheme shall be also ready for experimental exploration in the whole zoo of other physical systems undergoing a qpt .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that applicability of eq .",
    "( [ x_hat ] ) is not limited to mean - field theories : any experimental departures from the @xmath124 scaling ( apart from finite size corrections ) should indicate that mean - field value of the critical exponent @xmath0 does not describe the condensate properly .",
    "in such a case the correct value of the @xmath0 exponent should be easily extracted from experimental data with the help of eq .",
    "( [ x_hat ] ) .",
    "we have explored physics of the qpt in space in a ferromagnetic spin-1 bose - einstein condensate @xcite : the most flexible system for studies of qpts in space and time .",
    "our scaling results explain how singularities of the critical point affect the ground state magnetization of the condensate .",
    "they also suggest a new way for the measurement of the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "these findings are generally applicable to all systems undergoing a second order qpt .",
    "the quest for the full understanding of a spatial quench opens up a prospect of interdisciplinary studies similarly as time quenches have done to date @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the u.s .",
    "department of energy through the lanl / ldrd program .",
    "the key ingredient of our theory is the divergent healing length ( [ heal ] ) . below",
    "we derive it from mean - field equations @xmath140 that come from minimization of @xmath141 without the linear zeeman term ( [ energy ] )  see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] for the explanation of why we remove it from our considerations .",
    "the healing length is a typical length scale over which a local perturbation of the wave - function gets forgotten ( here we will have three characteristic length scales , but we will identify the leading one relevant for a long distance healing process ) . to find it , we assume the constant parameter @xmath142 across the condensate , and linearize mean - field equations ( [ meanfield ] ) .",
    "we write the wave - function as @xmath143 with @xmath41 and @xmath144 being the ground state solution . in the broken - symmetry phase",
    "we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while in the polar phase , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we use here the freedom to work with @xmath145 , which is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] .",
    "linearized equations take the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath33 stands for @xmath148 in the broken - symmetry phase , and for @xmath149 in the polar phase .",
    "the factor @xmath150 above is very close to unity as @xmath151 for @xmath74rb atoms considered here .    to proceed we diagonalize matrix @xmath33 by the transformation @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is a diagonal matrix made of eigenvalues of matrix @xmath33 . in the polar phase we find @xmath154",
    "while in the broken - symmetry phase we get @xmath155    after defining @xmath156 and some elementary algebra we get @xmath157 where the form of the function @xmath158 depends on system dimensionality ( 1d , 2d , or 3d ) , while @xmath159 is `` attached '' to the point in space where the perturbation is imposed on the wave - function .",
    "this solution implies that the eigenvalue vanishing at the critical point , @xmath160 , provides the leading contribution to the long - distance healing process near the critical point ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "indeed , a simple calculation shows that the wave function will forget about the perturbation imposed on it ( @xmath162 ) at a distance scaling as @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the divergent healing length equals @xmath163 . around the critical point",
    "we find it to be @xmath164 on the broken - symmetry ( @xmath165 ) and polar ( @xmath166 ) sides of the qpt , respectively .",
    "the expansion around @xmath167 was applied to obtain @xmath168 , i.e. , we have approximated the eigenvalue @xmath169 by @xmath170 near the critical point .",
    "these expressions fix the value of the mean - field critical exponent @xmath0 for our model : @xmath87 ( compare ( [ healing_l ] ) to ( [ heal ] ) ) .",
    "we conclude by showing another simplification of the full expression for the divergent healing length on the broken symmetry side . taking the limit of @xmath171 , well justified for @xmath74rb",
    ", we get @xmath172 without restricting ourselves to @xmath161 .",
    "our analytical predictions are valid in any dimensional system , but we test them numerically in a 1d model . our numerics is based on conjugate gradient minimization of the 1d energy functional @xmath173 obtained through dimensional reduction of the full 3d energy functional ( [ energy ] ) without the linear zeeman term  see sec .",
