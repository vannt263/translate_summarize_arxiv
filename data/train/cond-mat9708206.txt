    "the aim of this work is to present some analytical methods to obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of non - interacting electrons constrained to a finite domain with boundaries and submitted to a uniform magnetic field .",
    "this problem is relevant to various situations in condensed matter physics . in the low magnetic field regime , defined by the condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnetic flux through the system and @xmath2 is the quantum flux",
    ", recent experiments performed on small metallic systems did show how important is the effect of the boundaries @xcite .",
    "it determines the nature of the zero - field classical motion being either integrable or chaotic .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility has been shown using numerical and semiclassical methods to be reduced and to present large fluctuations in the chaotic case , whereas it is larger and varies slowly with the field in the integrable case @xcite . in the opposite limit @xmath3 of high fields ,",
    "we are in the so - called integer quantum hall effect regime ( iqhe ) , where the edge states associated with the boundary play a prominent role @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall concentrate on the problem of non - interacting electrons in a semi - infinite plane and in a disc .",
    "the classical dynamics allows for a natural distinction between bulk and edge states .",
    "a first semiclassical method is based on the einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) quantization rules @xcite and preserves this bulk and edge states splitting , by giving different quantization rules for each of them .",
    "this approximation is further improved for the semi - infinite plane by constructing the asymptotically matched wkb function and then finding its zeros corresponding to the energy levels .",
    "this procedure removes the gap between the bulk and edge energies , resulting in a very good approximation for the exact spectrum .",
    "the calculation is not new @xcite , however we present it in detail , as it serves a starting point for the wkb approximation for the disc .",
    "the spectrum of the disc is found using the more general comparison equation method ( for a general reference , see @xcite ) , also called the miller - good method @xcite to map the problem onto the semi - infinite plane s one .",
    "the obtained semiclassical formulas are valid for any strength of the magnetic field , thus providing us a way to study more particularly both the iqhe and the low field regimes .",
    "in this section the spectrum of an electron in the semi - infinite plane in a magnetic field is approximated first using the ebk quantization rules and then building the matched wkb wavefunction . to introduce semiclassical language ,",
    "we begin by considering the classical dynamics .      we consider a spinless particle of charge @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and mass @xmath6 constrained to move in the semi - infinite plane .",
    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 is applied perpendicular to the plane .",
    "cartesian coordinates are defined such that the @xmath8 axis is perpendicular to the boundary and the motion is confined to positive values of @xmath8 .",
    "it is convenient to consider the boundary having a finite length @xmath9 and therefore we impose periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10 direction so that the particle moves on a semi - infinite cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .    in the landau gauge @xmath11 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the particle is : @xmath12 and the momentum is @xmath13 .",
    "the total energy @xmath14 and the @xmath10-component @xmath15 of the momentum are constants of motion , therefore the problem is integrable . in the four - dimensional phase space of the cartesian",
    "coordinates and the corresponding momenta , each family of classical trajectories are winding on an invariant torus defined by the two constants of motion .",
    "the ensemble of trajectories splits naturally into two families : those that do not touch the boundary ( bulk trajectories ) , and others ( edge trajectories ) .",
    "bulk particles of energy @xmath14 go counterclockwise in circles of radius @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency ) with their center farther than @xmath18 from the edge and momenta @xmath19 .",
    "edge particles have momenta @xmath20 and undergo specular reflections on the boundary before closing a circle so that the cyclotron orbit center begins drifting along the edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "increasing @xmath21 at fixed energy , the bulk tori in phase space are transformed at @xmath22 in a discontinuous way into edge tori .",
    "we consider now the quantum - mechanical version of the same problem .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the wavefunction @xmath23 : @xmath24    the application of the ebk quantization rules for integrable systems leads to the quantization of the two actions @xmath25 and @xmath26 along the @xmath10 and @xmath8 axis . the action @xmath25 corresponding to the motion along the @xmath10 axis ( parallel to the boundary ) is @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the motion along the @xmath8 axis ( perpendicular to the boundary ) is different for the bulk and the edge states , therefore their quantization differs too . in particular",
    "the energy of the bulk states is found from @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "for the edge states the ebk condition is @xmath31 where @xmath32 for the bulk trajectories ( @xmath33 ) , the maslov index is @xmath34 and we obtain degenerate landau levels @xmath35 which correspond to states that do not feel the boundary . for the edge trajectories ( @xmath36 ) , the integration range is restricted because of the reflection on the boundary and the maslov index is @xmath37 , since there is one turning point ( maslov index @xmath38 ) and one reflection ( maslov index @xmath34 associated to a change of sign of the wavefunction ) .",
    "the energies are implicit solutions of ( [ quantization edge ] ) , they are non degenerate and bounded below by @xmath39 for each @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "there is a singularity in the ebk spectrum , separating bulk and edge energies .",
    "once the motion in the @xmath10-direction is integrated , the schrdinger equation together with the boundary condition ( [ dirichlet ] ) reduces to a one - dimensional sturm - liouville problem .",
    "a systematic wkb analysis is well - developed for those kind of problems and improves the ebk quantization .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath43 , and set @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the magnetic length . using ( [ classical hamiltonian ] ) , the schrdinger equation for the one - dimensional wavefunction @xmath47 reads : @xmath48 a subsequent change of variable @xmath49 gives : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "( [ transformed equation ] ) is a weber equation @xcite , and its solutions ( vanishing at infinity ) are : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a constant and @xmath54 a parabolic cylinder function .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition ( [ dirichlet ] ) reads in the new variables : @xmath55 since the solutions @xmath56 of eq .",
    "( [ wkb equation ] ) depend only on @xmath57 , without this condition the energies would be proportional to @xmath58 ( landau levels ) .",
    "however this condition makes the rescaled energies @xmath59 to depend on the ( energy - dependent ) parameter @xmath60 .",
    "they are therefore given by an implicit equation of the form : @xmath61 where @xmath60 is given by ( [ xi0 ] ) , and the label @xmath62 refers to different ` energy bands ' ( in the infinite @xmath9 limit , @xmath63 gives the appropriate energy bands by continuously varying @xmath64 ) .",
    "our purpose in this section is to use a semiclassical approximation in order to find explicit analytical expressions for the energies . as noted by isihara and ebina @xcite , for small @xmath57 ( i.e. , large energies ) , ( [ wkb equation ] )",
    "is a standard example of equation where the wkb method is applicable .",
    "it has two turning points at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . sufficiently far from them ,",
    "the wkb function is given by the following asymptotic expression @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are arbitrary constants .",
    "in the vicinity of the turning points this approximation breaks down .",
    "the potential @xmath70 is then linearized in eq . ( [ wkb equation ] ) and",
    "the resulting airy equation can be solved exactly .",
    "one obtains the approximate solution @xmath71 by matching the corresponding airy solutions for each turning point with the wkb solutions ( [ general wkb function ] ) valid to the right , between , and to the left of them .",
    "the function @xmath71 consists of five branches , related to the five overlapping intervals in which the wkb and airy approximations are valid .",
    "we start from large @xmath72 s .",
    "* the first branch has a domain defined by @xmath73 , where the expression ( [ general wkb function ] ) holds @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the wavefunction at infinity fixes @xmath74 , and we set arbitrarily @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the first branch of the wkb function is : @xmath76 it is always nonzero , so there are no solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dir1 ] ) for @xmath77 . *",
    "the second branch approximates the exact solution near the first turning point , i.e. for @xmath78 , where @xmath79 can be linearized and replaced by @xmath80 in equation ( [ wkb equation ] ) .",
    "it consists therefore of a linear combination of two independent airy functions ai(@xmath81 ) and bi(@xmath81 ) with @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath72 is such that @xmath83 , @xmath81 is large so the asymptotic approximations of airy functions can be used , and we can approximate the exponential in ( [ wkb1 ] ) by @xmath84 .",
    "we match for such @xmath72 s the solution of the linearized equation with @xmath85 and determine the unknown constants of the linear combination .",
    "this gives : @xmath86 the energies are found by imposing the dirichlet condition on this solution : @xmath87 where the @xmath88 are the @xmath62th zeros of the airy function ai(@xmath81 ) .",
    "these energies are associated with the ` whispering gallery ' orbits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) which are concentrated in a very narrow region near the boundary .",
    "we notice that the energies ( [ wkb2 energies ] ) can be obtained from a ` generalized ebk rule ' by letting @xmath62 be such that @xmath89 in ( [ quantization edge ] ) , instead of an integer .",
    "note that there are no energies for @xmath90 , since the real zeros of ai(@xmath81 ) are negative .",
    "* between the two turning points @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the expression ( [ general wkb function ] ) holds again and to determine the constants @xmath93 and @xmath94 we do the matching with @xmath95 in the interval @xmath96 .",
    "this gives for @xmath97 and @xmath98 : @xmath99 the argument of the sine for @xmath100 is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the classical action for the edge motion calculated in ( [ quantization edge ] ) .",
    "thus as expected we obtain the ebk quantization ( [ quantization edge ] ) for @xmath60 between but not too close to @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the comparison of the energies derived within the wkb approximation with the exact ones found numerically is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] .",
    "* this branch represents the function in the vicinity of the second turning point @xmath66 . repeating the scheme of matching with the previous third branch , we obtain for @xmath105 : @xmath106",
    "the energies correspond here either to edge trajectories which nearly complete full circles before being reflected or to bulk trajectories very close to the boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] we see that , for the lowest band ( @xmath107 ) , the energies of the fourth branch , found by setting @xmath108 , become closer below @xmath109 to the exact energies than those of the third branch .",
    "* the fifth branch @xmath110 is derived in a similar way . for @xmath111",
    ": @xmath112 the equation to be solved for the energies is : @xmath113 when @xmath114 is large , the right - hand side of this equation is a large number so that the argument of the tangent in the left - hand side is to a good approximation @xmath115 time an half - integer .",
    "thus for @xmath114 sufficiently large the energies are very close to the landau levels given by ( [ quantization bulk ] ) , i.e. @xmath116 . the solutions of the energy equations for the fourth and the fifth branches and the exact energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] .    the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] , [ fig:2b ] and [ fig:2c ] show a very good agreement between the exact calculation and the matched wkb approximation even for the lowest energies .",
    "the distinction between the bulk and the edge states disappears and the spectrum rises smoothly from @xmath117 ( from above ) to infinitely large edge energies .",
    "we study here the similar problem as that of the previous section but for a disc of radius @xmath118 and a magnetic field applied in the @xmath119-direction perpendicular to the disc .",
    "for this geometry , a convenient choice for @xmath120 is given by the radial gauge @xmath121 , where @xmath122 are polar coordinates and @xmath123 , @xmath124 the corresponding unit vectors .",
    "the two momenta canonically conjugated to @xmath125 and @xmath126 are @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the @xmath119-component of the angular momentum . in the symmetric gauge",
    "the hamiltonian of the particle reads : @xmath129 since @xmath130 and the energy are conserved by reflexion on the boundary , we again deal with an integrable system .",
    "we can as before distinguish between edge and bulk trajectories : for @xmath131 the particle bounces and drifts along the boundary ( edge trajectories ) ; for @xmath132 it follows a closed - circle bulk trajectory ; for @xmath133 or @xmath134 , the motion is forbidden or outside the disc .",
    "note that positive values of angular momenta are associated with bulk trajectories whose cyclotron orbit centers are closer than @xmath135 to the origin .",
    "let us emphasize that if @xmath118 is of the order of or less than the magnetic length @xmath136 , the distinction between edge and bulk motion becomes meaningless from the quantum - mechanical point of view , all cyclotron radii being greater than @xmath136 , and then also than @xmath118 ( @xmath137 is a lower bound for the energy ) .",
    "for such low fields or small systems all classical trajectories of interest are of the edge type .",
    "the case of weak and zero fields has been extensively studied before @xcite .",
    "we will return to the weak field limit later to show the limitation of our methods in that regime .",
    "we now formulate the quantum - mechanical problem .",
    "since the system is invariant by rotation along ( @xmath138 ) , we choose wavefunctions @xmath139 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath143 then satisfies the schrdinger radial equation : @xmath144 we impose the boundary conditions @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "note that equation ( [ dsturm liouville ] ) with these boundary conditions has an exact solution given by @xmath147 , where @xmath53 is a constant and @xmath148 the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approximation of eq .",
    "( [ dsturm liouville ] ) becomes better as the magnetic field is decreased .",
    "indeed , the energies @xmath14 tend to their finite zero - field values when @xmath149 and therefore @xmath150 approaches zero .    as a result of the singularity at the origin due to the centrifugal potential @xmath151 in equation ( [ dsturm liouville ] )",
    ", the wkb method fails when applied directly . to overcome this difficulty we follow langer @xcite and",
    "make the change of variable @xmath152 , where @xmath153 .",
    "the resulting equation for the function @xmath154 is : @xmath155 this equation can be solved using a wkb analysis similar to that of section 2 .",
    "the two turning points are @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",
    "note that in two dimensions ( the case we consider here ) there is no need for a langer substitution as in the case of the radial equation for the hydrogen atom @xcite . for @xmath158",
    ", there are no real turning points , thus the wkb function is like in ( [ wkb1 ] ) an exponentially increasing function when @xmath159 ; therefore there are no solutions for such @xmath160 s , and we restrict our discussion to the classically allowed region @xmath161",
    ".    however we shall prefer a uniform approximation approach to the wkb analysis , because the two turning points @xmath162 and @xmath163 coalesce when @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( the value @xmath166 corresponds to a cyclotron trajectory centered at the origin ; @xmath165 is actually not relevant ) .",
    "@xmath167 is also a special case where one of the turning points ( @xmath168 ) goes to infinity .",
    "we make use here of the so - called comparison equation method , that gives correct approximations no matter how close are the turning points .",
    "this will enable us to map the problem of the disc to the previously solved semi - infinite plane case . in this method @xcite",
    ", the approximate solution is written in terms of a function @xmath169 , solution of a simpler equation .",
    "we shall choose for this simpler ` comparison equation ' the equation ( [ wkb equation ] ) we already solved , in which we make for convenience the change of variable @xmath170 so that @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is a parameter to be determined later .",
    "the solution of ( [ dwkb equation ] ) is obtained by multiplying @xmath169 by a slowly varying amplitude and allowing its argument @xmath173 to depend weakly on @xmath8 . in other words , we look for solutions of the form @xmath174 . the equation obeyed by the mapping function @xmath175",
    "is simplified by choosing @xmath176 and reads : @xmath177 if @xmath178 varies slowly enough or if the left - hand side is large enough , the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ mapping equation ] ) is negligible .",
    "this constitutes the approximation itself ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "we define by analogy with ( [ quantization edge ] ) the classical radial action variable : @xmath179 ( if @xmath180 , this action is purely imaginary and we use @xmath181 , @xmath182 for all @xmath183 ; if @xmath184 , we define @xmath185 by integrating from @xmath186 to @xmath168 so it is again purely imaginary and ( [ daction ] ) still holds with @xmath187 , @xmath182 for @xmath188 ) .    for the above analysis to be meaningful",
    ", the mapping @xmath189 has to be one - to - one , i.e. @xmath190 and @xmath191 must be always non - zero . from ( [ mapping equation ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath192 must map into @xmath193 .",
    "this enables us to integrate our approximation of ( [ mapping equation ] ) , which takes the form : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the classical action ( [ quantization edge ] ) for the semi - infinite plane . the energy @xmath196 is obtained by letting @xmath197 in ( [ integrated map equation ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath198 for @xmath199 and @xmath103 for @xmath200 , we obtain @xmath201 the mapping function takes the following forms for @xmath202 and @xmath203 : @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the wkb solution of equation ( [ wkb equation ] ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath206 , it satisfies the same boundary conditions as in section 2 , i.e. @xmath207 and @xmath208 , with : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the total magnetic flux through the system in units of the flux quantum .    to find the set of discrete levels one has therefore to solve the implicit equation @xmath211 where @xmath212 depends on @xmath57 through ( [ hatxi0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath213 is the band energy curve ( [ energy band ] ) for the semi - infinite plane , and also the band energy curve for the disc in the limit of infinitely large @xmath214 if @xmath215 .",
    "in fact , in this limit @xmath212 in ( [ hatxi0 ] ) varies continuously when @xmath216 runs over all negative integer values ( @xmath173 is continuous ) .",
    "we distinguish the following typical cases :    * @xmath217 , _ bulk states_. + for absolute values of the angular momentum @xmath218 and energies low enough for @xmath219 to hold , @xmath186 and @xmath212 are large negative numbers ( see ( [ hatxi0 ] ) , ( [ hatenergy ] ) and ( [ approximate sigma ] ) ) .",
    "it follows from the analysis of the previous section that @xmath220 is close to a landau level @xmath221 , i.e. levels with small angular momenta @xmath222 practically do not feel the boundary . for negative @xmath216 ,",
    "the level is close to the @xmath223th landau level , for positive @xmath216 the level is close to the @xmath224th landau level , i.e. @xmath225 , @xmath226 being a positive integer .",
    "one finds for @xmath160 the upper bound @xmath227 ( which gives back the classical condition for @xmath228 ) .",
    "the fact that there are no bulk levels with positive angular momenta @xmath229 near the @xmath62th landau level is seen clearly on the numerically calculated spectrum as a function of the magnetic field , by following the levels from @xmath230 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : disk ] or @xcite ) .",
    "each time the band index @xmath62 is decreased by one , one level of positive @xmath216 is removed .",
    "* @xmath217 , _ edge states_. + these are associated with negative values of @xmath216 , @xmath231 . using the results of section 2 , we see that there are no levels if @xmath232 , i.e. if @xmath233 ( since @xmath173 is an increasing function ) .",
    "this corresponds to the lower classical bound for the angular momentum @xmath234 , where @xmath235 . for @xmath236 ,",
    "the rescaled energy @xmath237 becomes infinite .",

    "consider @xmath289 varying continuously from @xmath290 to @xmath103 .",
    "then all eigenstates and energies of the system evolve adiabatically so that edge levels lower their energies and fall ( at @xmath291 ) into the level situated just below them .",
    "bulk levels are nearly not affected except those with positive @xmath216 , whose energies @xmath292 is increased by @xmath58 , the electron moving from one landau level into another ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . introducing the fermi energy @xmath293 for an independent electron gas at zero temperature , we see that the effect of changing the flux by one unit is to remove @xmath62 electrons from the center of the disc and to transfer them to the boundary if @xmath293 is between the @xmath62th and the @xmath294th landau level ( as in laughlin s argument @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion is not specific to the disc geometry , since it is due to positive @xmath216 states which are almost insensitive to the boundary when @xmath295 .",
    "this scenario is therefore generalizable to arbitrary billiards in the strong magnetic fields .",
    "we have presented a calculation of the energy spectrum of an electron in a perpendicular and uniform magnetic field for the half plane and the disc geometry .",
    "these situations are the simplest to describe features due to the presence of both perpendicular field and a boundary .",
    "in fact , explicit calculations can be made in both cases using the existence of a constant of motion resulting from the symmetry of the system ( namely the momentum in the direction parallel to the boundary for the half plane , and the angular momentum for the disc ) .",
    "one can then reduce these two - dimensional problems into one - dimensional ones and use semiclassical methods to solve them .    because of the inherent splitting between bulk and edge classical trajectories , in the standard ebk approach one still have a clear separation between bulk and edge states .",
    "a more correct semiclassical approach removes this splitting by taking into account the coalescence of the caustics with the boundary which are due to edge orbits making nearly full circles before being reflected or to bulk orbits very close to the boundary .",
    "this removes the ebk gap between bulk and edge energies and results in a semiclassical spectrum which approximates surprisingly well the lowest levels , as far as we checked from our numerical calculations .",
    "blaschke and brack did independently reach similar conclusions using periodic orbits techniques in their recent work on the disc billiard @xcite . in the quantum system under usual boundary conditions ( like the dirichlet case here considered ) ,",
    "the notion of edge and bulk states is thus not anymore well - defined . to restore a precise meaning of such a dichotomy in the quantum case and",
    "describe for instance the transition from edge to bulk states in the context of the integer quantum hall effect , one has to consider more general boundary conditions @xcite pertaining to the family defined by atiyah , patodi and singer @xcite .",
    "the extension of our results to general ( non - integrable ) billiards with smooth boundaries could be made or by using the more elaborate path - integration semiclassical methods , or , for almost circular billiards , by expanding the wavefunction on the wkb disc wavefunction .",
    "such billiards are interesting because of the existence in zero field of regimes of localization of the wavefunction in the angular momentum space @xcite .",
    "our approach of deriving the uniform approximation for the separable systems can be of relevance in connection with the recent work on uniform approximation of the diffraction contribution to the semiclassical spectral density for general magnetic field free billiards @xcite",
