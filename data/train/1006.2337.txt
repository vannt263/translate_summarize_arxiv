    "the microscopic physics of the iron pnictides and related high-@xmath4 superconductors  @xcite is a subject of extensive studies .",
    "the parent systems are antiferromagnetically ordered @xcite , implying that coulomb interactions must play some role .",
    "the metallic nature of these systems gives rise to a tendency to treat the interactions perturbatively .",
    "however , various considerations have led to the notion that the parent iron pnictides and iron chalcogenides are on the verge of a mott localization transition .",
    "these considerations have been based on the observed bad - metal properties  @xcite , first - principles calculations  @xcite , and related analyses  @xcite .",
    "the bad - metal properties are characteristic of metallic systems in proximity to a mott localization .",
    "the electrical resistivity at room temperature corresponds to a short mean free path , on the order of the average inter - electron spacing .",
    "the drude weight seen in the room temperature optical conductivity is considerably suppressed compared to its non - interacting value @xcite",
    ". finally , relatively small changes of temperature induce transfers of the optical spectral weight extending to the ev range @xcite .",
    "the lack of observation@xcite of any pronounced incoherent peaks in the high - energy electron spectrum has raised some questions about the incipient mott picture , but recent microscopic calculations @xcite have suggested that this arises from a large damping whose effect is enhanced by the multi - orbital nature of the system .",
    "there is some evidence for the incipient mott picture from the magnetic sector as well .",
    "high - energy spin - wave - like excitations have been seen at the zone boundaries @xcite .",
    "in addition , the total spin spectral weight is sizable ; for instance , it is on the order of @xmath5 @xmath6/fe in cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these properties can not be accounted for by the electrons close to the fermi energy alone ; in particular , since the fermi surfaces comprise small electron and hole pockets , the spin spectral weight coming from the electronic states near the fermi surfaces will be much smaller than that observed experimentally .",
    "instead , the observed spin excitation spectrum is more naturally associated with the electronic states far away from the fermi energy , as would be the case in a metal close to a mott localization .",
    "the incipient mott picture arises when @xmath8 is not too far away from the critical value for a mott transition .",
    "( here @xmath9 refers to the characteristic bandwidth of the fe 3d electrons , and @xmath10 a combination of their coulomb repulsions and hund s couplings . ) in order to further substantiate this picture , it is important to tune the system into a mott insulating state .",
    "recently , this has been demonstrated @xcite in the iron oxychalcogenides , which contain an fe square lattice that is expanded compared to the iron pnictides and iron chalcogenides .",
    "the lattice expansion gives rise to a narrowing of the 3d - bands and a concomitant enhancement of @xmath8 , which pushes the system through the mott transition and into the mott - insulating regime .",
    "based on the above considerations , it is very important to show theoretically that a transition from a metal to a mott insulator generally exists in multi - orbital models appropriate for the parent compounds of the iron pnictides .",
    "this is especially so given that the number of 3d - electrons per fe is even in these systems .",
    "the mott transition , which has long been a subject of fundamental interest  @xcite , is studied in both one - orbital hubbard model with one electron per site  @xcite , and multi - orbital systems at commensurate fillings  @xcite . in the one - orbital model and paramagnetic phases",
    ", the mott transition can be understood within the brinkman - rice picture  @xcite , with an interaction - induced suppression of the coherent one - electron spectral weight near the fermi energy , and the concomitant development of incoherent spectral weight away from the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the paramagnetic phases is advantageous for considering the mott transition , since an odd number of electrons per unit cell means that any insulating state must be the result of interactions .",
    "the picture applies in the part of the phase diagram above the temperature of ordering transitions ( typically into antiferromagnetic phases ) ; this part of the phase diagram widens with the increase of magnetic frustration  @xcite .    in our case , since the parent iron pnictides contain an even number of ( six ) 3d - electrons per fe , an insulating state could in principle simply be a band insulator .",
    "the issue is particularly pertinent given that the fermi surfaces of the iron pnictides and related systems are small pockets .",
    "indeed , the non - interacting band structure consists of non - degenerate bands ( two bands are called degenerate only when their energies are the same at every point in the momentum space ) and is close to that of a semiconductor with a small overlap in energy between the bottom of the conduction bands and the top of the valence bands ; each band is far away from half - filling .",
    "it is _ a priori _ possible that , if an increasing @xmath10 suppresses a metallic state , the system goes into a correlated band insulator first , thereby invalidating the picture of a bad metal on the verge of a mott transition . in other words , it is a non - trivial question in the case of the iron pnictides as to whether the metallic state can be in proximity to a mott transition and , if so , whether the mott insulator resembles that for the canonical one - orbital hubbard model with one electron per unit cell .",
    "moreover , given that the bandwidths are very different from band to band , another non - trivial question is whether a mott transition , when it exists , is a one - step transition or it can be an orbital selective mott transition ( osmt).@xcite    to address these issues , we study how a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in the paramagnetic phase may happen in multi - orbital models of iron pnictides containing an even number of electrons filled .",
    "our work builds on earlier studies of multi - orbital models for transition metal oxides and related systems .",
    "physics in these multi - orbital models is very rich .",
    "for instance , many factors , such as inequivalent bandwidths , crystal field splitting , and hund s coupling , may affect the nature of the transition  @xcite .",
    "we note that there is a tendency in the literature to work in the band representation and ignore the orbital characters.@xcite in our study , we show that the orbital characters serve as another important factor for the mott transition .",
    "we first study the mit in a two - orbital hubbard model with two electrons per site , with a kinetic - energy part given by the minimal band dispersion for the pnictides  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the model within a slave - spin ( ss ) formulation  @xcite , which has the advantage of readily capturing both the coherent and incoherent part of the electronic spectrum and , in addition , the effect of hund s coupling .",
    "we show that the orbital degeneracy guarantees the existence of a one - step metal - to - mott - insulator transition in this model . neither a band insulator nor an osmt may take place",
    ". the critical coupling @xmath11 , which is larger in multi - orbital systems than in the single - orbital case @xcite , is greatly reduced by a nonzero hund s coupling ; this is consistent with earlier studies in other multi - orbital contexts.@xcite we find that the nature of the mott insulator depends on the ratio of the inter - orbital and intra - orbital coulomb repulsions",
    ". it can be either a high - spin mott state which is driven by the intra - orbital coupling , or a low - spin orbital - mott state driven by the inter - orbital coupling .",
    "we then consider a more realistic four - orbital model including @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 orbitals . in this model ,",
    "the nature of the mit depends on the strength of the hund s coupling .",
    "a strong hund s coupling stabilizes a high - spin mott state on the insulator side .",
    "but when the hund s coupling is either zero or weak compared to the crystal field splitting , we find a novel orbital selective mit .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals experience a transition to a mott insulator ; at the same critical coupling , a transition to either a band insulator ( at zero hund s coupling ) or an orbitally polarized insulator ( at nonzero albeit weak hund s coupling ) takes place in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals . in this case",
    ", the insulating state always has an intermediate spin value , even at zero hund s coupling .",
    "we establish this to be a direct consequence of the double degeneracy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the slave spin formulation and introduce the two - orbital model .",
    "iii is devoted to the mit in the two - orbital model at half - filling .",

    "this leads to two non - degenerate bands which has asymmetric local density of states ( ldos ) with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "the fermi surface consists small electron and hole pockets , indicating that both bands are far away from half - filling .",
    "it is then important to ask whether , when the interactions are turned on , the system undergoes a transition to a mott insulator , or the band degeneracy can be fully lifted so that a correlated band insulator may be stabilized .",
    "if a mott transition does take place , it is also interesting to ask whether the transition to the mott insulator is through a single mit or via an osmt .",
    "most of previous studies on the mit in multi - orbital systems work in the band presentation , assuming a diagonalized band structure with zero inter - band hopping .",
    "this oversimplified treatment neglects the orbital character of the model . within this representation ,",
    "the only way to generate two bands with asymmetric ldos is to introduce a finite crystal field splitting which breaks the orbital degeneracy in the model . in this study",
    "we choose to work in the orbital representation , which takes into account the full orbital characters of the model . in this orbital representation ,",
    "the symmetry of @xmath13 and @xmath38 under interchanging the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals guarantees that both orbitals contribute equally to the band structure .",
    "the above considerations lead to two important consequences .",
    "first , @xmath64 for any value of @xmath10 , i.e. , each orbital is exactly at half - filling .",
    "so a mott transition is possible at finite @xmath10 .",
    "second , @xmath65 , and an osmt can not take place even though the widths of the two bands are very different . at finite @xmath10 , the hopping parameter @xmath66 is uniformly renormalized to @xmath67 since the crystal field splitting is zero in this model .",
    "hence the dispersion @xmath68 ( the fourier transformation of @xmath66 ) is also normalized to @xmath69 .",
    "we thus see that the topology of the band structure is unchanged by the interactions . at @xmath70 ,",
    "the chemical potential is determined by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath73 the number of sites .",

    "the fermi surface is determined by @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the fermi surface of the interacting system is _ identical _ to the one in the non - interacting system .",
    "furthermore , the filling factor of each quasi - particle band does not depend on the interaction and must be identical to the value in the non - interacting case .",
    "therefore , in the presence of nonzero interaction , the quasi - particle bands are still partially occupied , and a band insulator never emerges .",
    "the system stays in the metallic state until the quasi - particle spectral weight @xmath80 , where both bands go through a transition to a mott insulator .",

    ", the electron filling is about @xmath160 per site per spin in the @xmath161 orbital , but very close to @xmath162 per site per spin in all other four orbitals .",
    "the @xmath161 orbital hardly contributes to the band structure near the fermi level .",
    "these suggest that one may study a model including only @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 orbitals by assuming that the @xmath161 orbital lies far below the fermi level and is fully occupied . taking model parameters of ref .   but",

    "[ f.fig11 ] .",
    "this transition to the is1 state can be understood as follow : at @xmath58 , the @xmath2 orbital is empty and the @xmath3 orbital is fully occupied in the insulating state due to the crystal field splitting .",
    "hence at @xmath170 these two orbitals undergo a transition to a band insulator . on the other hand ,",
    "the degenerate @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals are at half - filling , and a mott transition takes place at the same @xmath11 value . since at @xmath58",

    "given that @xmath200 in this model , and assuming that @xmath11 for the mit at @xmath201 stays the same value as @xmath58 , we may estimate the tricritical point where the transition between the is2 and the high - spin mott state and the mit meets .",
    "it is located at @xmath202 , which is consistent wit h the numerical result @xmath203 .",
    "fig11.eps    it is very important to check how the fermi surface in the metallic state evolves in the presence of interactions . in the noninteracting case ,",
    "the fermi surface of the four - orbital model consists of two hole pockets centered at @xmath204 point in the one - iron brillouin zone and two electron pockets centered at @xmath205 and @xmath206 points , respectively .",
    "we have checked that for a large portion of the metallic regime in the phase diagram , i.e. , to the left of the dotted line at @xmath207 ev in fig .",
    "[ f.fig11 ] , the fermi surface of the interacting system has the same topology as that for the non - interacting system . in this regime , even near the high - spin mott insulator , there are only very tiny changes in the size and shape of the hole and electron pockets .",
    "this is similar to the result of the two - orbital model , in which the fermi surface is always identical to the one in the non - interacting system .",
    "but in the four - orbital model , we find that the topology of the fermi surface may change when the system is close enough to the intermediate - spin states ( in the regime between the dotted line and the thicker solid line in fig .",

    "but there are some differences .",
    "first , in ref .",

    "but in our case , the orbital degeneracy between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals stabilizes the is1 state with a non - zero spin value at @xmath58 .",
    "a second difference lies in the way treating the electron - electron interaction term @xmath38 : we consider the full interaction in our ssmf calculation ; while in ref .  , the spin - flip and the pair - hopping terms are neglected from the mf approximation .",
    "this results in different insulating states : the is2 state in our paper consists an orbitally polarized insulator in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals , but the bands with @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbital characters in the @xmath209 state in ref .",
    "are simple band insulators .",
    "an interesting question is whether an osmt may take place when more than two orbitals are included .",
    "recently , a mechanism of the osmt based on the lifting of orbital degeneracy is proposed .",
    "@xcite according to this mechanism , in a system with more than two orbitals , if the orbital degeneracy is partially lifted by a crystal field splitting , an osmt may take place even when the bandwidths are equal .",
    "it is suggested that an osmt triggered by this mechanism may exist in iron pnictides.@xcite from fig .",
    "[ f.fig9 ] we find that for @xmath139 , the bandwidth of the @xmath2 orbital gets stronger renormalization than the others .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced for larger @xmath23 .",
    "however , no osmt is observed up to @xmath210 .",
    "this is not too surprising . on the one hand ,",
    "the above mechanism is proposed by assuming zero inter - orbital hopping .",
    "the four - orbital model discussed in this section contains non - zero inter - orbital hoppings , which enhance the orbital correlations and favor an one - stage mott transition . on the other hand , according to the mechanism , an osmt is easier to be realized if the orbital whose degeneracy is lifted is at half - filling but the degenerate orbitals are away from half - filling , so that the lifted orbital is localized while the degenerate ones are still metallic . in the four - orbital model we consider ,",
    "the degenerate @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals are exactly at half filling , making the mott insulator more stable .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the metal - insulator transitions in several multi - orbital hubbard models for the parent iron pnictides using a slave - spin formulation .    in the two - orbital model ,",
    "a transition to a mott insulator generally exists at half - filling .",
    "the hund s coupling reduces the critical coupling significantly .",
    "we find that the nature of the mott insulator depends on the ratio @xmath145 .",
    "for @xmath142 , the insulator is a high - spin mott state with zero double occupancy but a spin triplet . for @xmath143 ,",
    "by contrast , the insulator is an orbital - mott state with spin singlet and finite double occupancy .",
    "the low - spin orbital - mott state is unstable to a band insulator if the orbital degeneracy is lifted , and can be viewed as a special case of an orbitally polarized insulator .",
    "the phase diagram for the metal - to - insulator transition in the more realistic four - orbital model contains additional features .",
    "we find a transition to a high - spin @xmath163 mott insulator when the hund s coupling is strong enough ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "this high - spin mott insulator is an analogy to the @xmath140 mott insulator in the two - orbital model . at weak including zero hund s couplings ( @xmath211 ) we find a transition to intermediate - spin insulating states .",
    "such a transition is an orbitally selective metal - insulator transition , namely , different orbitals undergo transitions to different insulating states at a single critical value @xmath11 . at @xmath58",
