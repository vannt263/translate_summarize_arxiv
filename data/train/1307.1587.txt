    "cluster beams have been studied in the last century extensively with respect to their physical and chemical properties and even today the interest in technological applications is increasing rapidly@xcite .",
    "prominent examples are the use for cluster beam deposition , cluster impact lithography , and the application as target beams in , e.g. , storage ring experiments which has started only in the last few decades . for applications in hadron physics experiments or in experiments with high intense laser beams ,",
    "the most important advantage is that they provide a pure target material inside a vacuum chamber with densities in the range between gas beams and the solid state targets .",
    "cluster beams consisting of particles with sizes from the nanometer to the micrometer scale propagate through vacuum with almost no increase of their angular spread , so that it is possible to provide a spatially well defined interaction zone for , e.g. , a particle beam in a storage ring or a laser beam .    in hadron physics experiments at a storage ring the cluster beams are typically produced by expansion of gaseous materials in laval type nozzles .",
    "although such targets can be operated in principal with all kind of gaseous materials ranging from hydrogen to , e.g. , xenon , the use of hydrogen is of special interest as effective proton target for the investigation of elementary reactions .",
    "examples for experimental facilities using such hydrogen cluster beams as internal targets at a storage ring are the anke@xcite experiment and the former @xcite experiment , both situated at the cosy@xcite accelerator of the forschungszentrum jlich . for the established internal target experiments mainly the density and the purity of the cluster beams were important , but for the design of new experimental facilities which can be operated with event rates increased by one or two orders of magnitude , the precise knowledge of microscopic properties , like velocity or mass distributions , or time structure , became of high importance .",
    "this information is especially important for the simulation of the interaction between intense pulsed laser beams and cluster beams .",
    "an example for a future experiment at a storage ring is the @xmath0 detector panda@xcite at the planned accelerator centrum fair in darmstadt ( germany ) .",
    "for this experiment a cluster jet target has been developed at the university of mnster where the number of target atoms per unit area is above @xmath1 at a distance of @xmath2 from the nozzle .",
    "a detailed description of this prototype is presented in ref .   and ref .  .",
    "the measurements presented in this work have been performed at this prototype .    in these targets",
    "the clusters are produced from ultra - clean cold compressed hydrogen fluid with temperatures of , e.g. , @xmath3 and pressures of about @xmath4 , which is pressed through a laval nozzle with a minimum diameter in the order of @xmath5 . during the expansion of the fluid through the nozzle into a first vacuum chamber clusters",
    "are produced . directly behind the nozzle the shape of the jet beam , consisting of both clusters and a gas beam ,",
    "is determined by the shape of the divergent part of the production nozzle . in order to prepare a well defined cluster beam for experiments and to suppress the disturbing residual gas background from the gas beam , a set of two skimmers",
    "is used to separate differential pumping stages .",
    "the second skimmer , which is denoted in the following as collimator , determines the final shape and size of the cluster beam at all further vacuum stages , and especially at the interaction point with the beam of the storage ring in the scattering chamber . for more details",
    "see ref .  .",
    "a schematic sketch of this setup operated with gaseous hydrogen is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : principleofoperation ] .    schematic view of the principle of operation of a cluster jet source which produces clusters from hydrogen gas in front of the laval nozzle . ]    for an optimized use as internal target in storage ring experiments , e.g. , for hadron physics experiments , it is essential to determine and to adjust the target thickness @xmath6 , the number of target atoms per unit area . with the knowledge of the thickness",
    "the luminosity @xmath7 of the internal experiment can be calculated ( see , e.g. ,  ref .  ) , where @xmath8 is the revolution frequency and @xmath9 the number of circulating particles in the storage ring .",
    "given the cross section @xmath10 of a specific reaction between target and storage ring beam particles , the mean rate @xmath11 of these reactions can be determined .",
    "this determination is especially important for adjusting the target thickness to achieve a desired reaction rate and to estimate the rate of background events . using a cartesian coordinate system , where the cluster beam propagates along the z axis and the stored beam along the x axis and assuming that the transverse width of the stored beam is negligible compared to the size of the cluster beam , it is possible to calculate the target thickness @xmath6 in units of number of atoms per square centimeter at a specific distance @xmath12 behind the nozzle directly from the volume density distribution  @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the molar mass of the gas atoms and @xmath16 the avogadro constant . in case of the cluster jet target",
    "the thickness can be measured by inserting movable rods into the cluster jet . at the cluster target prototype for the panda experiment",
    "such rods are mounted in a scattering chamber located approximately two meters behind the nozzle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scatteringchamber ] ) . here",
    "the rod diameter of @xmath17 is small compared to the size of the cluster  jet which is typically in the order of about @xmath18 .",
    "clusters colliding with these rods are stopped and lead by evaporation to an increase of the vacuum pressure in this chamber . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressureprofile ] a typical measurement of the vacuum pressure is presented , where the pressure increase is plotted as a function of the rod position . with such kind of measurements the size as well as the position of the cluster jet within the vacuum stage can be determined easily . moreover , assuming a specific volume density distribution @xmath13 this pressure profile can be described by the following equation @xcite : @xmath19    scattering chamber with moveable rods used to measure the target thickness . ]",
    "example of a pressure profile measured in the scattering chamber . ]    in this equation @xmath20 is the background pressure , @xmath21  the center position of the cluster jet , @xmath22  the universal gas constant , @xmath23  the molar mass of the gas , @xmath24  the known pumping speed of the used pumping system , and @xmath25 the mean velocity of the clusters .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath25 depends on the stagnation condition , i.e. , the temperature @xmath26 and the pressure @xmath27 , as well as on the nozzle geometry .",
    "however , for constant numbers for @xmath28 and @xmath29 the velocity @xmath25 is constant .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the target thickness in a first step the target density distribution  @xmath30 has to be adjusted to describe the relative shape of the measured pressure profile .",
    "for an absolute target density determination the mean velocity @xmath25 has to be known . in order to minimize the uncertainty of the extracted volume density , the mean velocity has to be measured with an accuracy which does not exceed the uncertainty of the pressure and of the pumping speed . at the presented setup both uncertainties amount to about  10% .",
    "since the cluster beams from the described cluster target sources are optimized for highest volume densities , the used nozzles differ significantly both in shape and size from the ones commonly used by groups specialized in the investigation of velocity and mass distributions , e.g. , work on hydrogen clusters reported in ref .  .",
    "in the cited work a pin hole nozzle with a minimum diameter of @xmath31 was used , whereas for the production of the cluster beams described here trumped shaped nozzle geometries with minimum diameters of about @xmath5 are used .",
    "both factors can significantly change the velocity distribution of the clusters in the generated beam and therefore new systematic studies of these cluster target beams had to be performed .",
    "the mean velocity of the hydrogen clusters produced with a similar trumped shaped nozzle with a throat diameter of @xmath32 was already measured@xcite at the target for the e835 experiment at fermilab and it was found , that it can be described adequately by the maximum local velocity @xmath33 of a perfect gas accelerated in an isentropic expansion through a convergent - divergent nozzle@xcite : @xmath34 in this equation @xmath35 is the gas temperature at the inlet of the nozzle and @xmath36 is the adiabatic index .",
    "these measurements were done at a pressure below @xmath37 and temperatures between @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the hydrogen is in the gas phase before entering the nozzle . however , later optimization studies on hydrogen cluster targets@xcite showed that a significant performance increase is possible , i.e. , an increase of the achievable maximum target thickness by orders of magnitude .",
    "one prerequisite for this is that the target is operated with hydrogen being in the liquid phase before entering the nozzle .",
    "since it is known from previous measurements , e.g. , ref .  , that the phase transition from the gas phase into the liquid phase has a significant impact on the cluster velocity , precise measurements on the velocity distributions and mean velocities as well as a comparison with the situation obtained with hydrogen being in the gas phase before entering the nozzle were strongly needed . based on this data verifications and optimizations of calculations will be possible .",
    "for this reason a dedicated time - of - flight system was designed and installed at the mnster cluster jet target .",
    "detailed studies on the velocity distributions as function of the operating parameters were performed which is presented in the first part of this work .",
    "although the time - of - flight system enabled for a precise determination of the velocity distributions and with this for the calculation of the mean velocities , the measurement time of several hours makes it impractical to use this system regularly for the volume density determination described above .",
    "this is especially true for optimization studies where the temperature and pressure at the nozzle inlet is changed very often .",
    "therefore it was essential to be able to calculate the mean cluster velocity as function of the stagnation conditions in the typical operation region with a precision , as discussed before , below 10% .",
    "many groups , e.g. , ref .  , ref .  , and ref .   have measured mean velocities of clusters and extracted fluid properties like the temperature of the cluster at the end of the expansion based on different equations of state . ref .  , for example , used an equation of state to produce a theoretical prediction for the mean velocity by assuming a constant final temperature .",
    "the values predicted with this method deviate from the measurements presented in the same work by about 20%40% for the data points measured at temperatures below the boiling point .",
    "therefore a new method had to be developed to allow for more accurate predictions at the discussed stagnation conditions . in the second part of this work",
    "such a method is presented , introducing two parameters which had to be determined only once by a fit to the measured data . in the operation region of the investigated cluster source",
    "this techniques provides precise predictions with an average absolute deviation of only about 5% compared to the measured mean cluster velocities .",
    "this applies both to the regions of liquid and of gaseous hydrogen in front of the nozzle .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : tofsetup ] the schematic view of the utilized time - of - flight setup is shown .",
    "clusters produced in the cluster source are ionized by a pulsed electron gun mounted at a short distance behind the collimator .",
    "this electron gun is operated in a pulsed mode with a repetition rate of about @xmath40 and a pulse width of approximately @xmath41 .",
    "the current of the electron beam is reduced in such a way that for each pulse no more than a single ionized cluster is registered .",
    "the ionized clusters itself are detected by a channeltron after a flight path of @xmath42 . due to this long distance and pulse widths in the microsecond time scale ,",
    "the observed time - of - flight times being in the range between @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be obtained with high resolution .",
    "the start and stop pulses are detected by a timer system based on a mc9s08qg8 micro controller by freescale semiconductor and the time difference is send to a computer .",

    "cross section of the calibration source used to produce hydrogen ions with known kinetic energies . ]    in order to extract time - of - flight information with high resolution the complete setup has to be calibrated with respect to possible timing offsets introduced by the pulsed electron gun device and the cluster detection system . for this purpose the calibration source for ions with known kinetic energy is used ( fig .

    "the source consists of two coaxial cylinders .",
    "the outer cylinder is electrically grounded while the inner cylinder is connected to a voltage source providing a potential of up to @xmath45 .",
