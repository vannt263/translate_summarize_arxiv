    "the first observations by the advanced generation of interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors is set to ignite a new era of astronomy in which gw triggered follow - ups by facilities operating outside the gw spectrum will become common place .",
    "complementary observations from electromagnetic ( em ) , neutrino or high energy particle facilities would not only improve the confidence of a gw detection , but also maximise the science return via a wealth of additional astrophysical information .",
    "the advanced generation of detectors will be led by advanced ligo ( aligo ) @xcite during the second half of 2015 and followed by advanced virgo ( adv ) @xcite a year later @xcite .",
    "coalescing systems of bnss are one of the most promising sources of gws in terms of detection @xcite ; at design sensitivity ( around 2018 ) , the expected detection rates of these sources are of order 0.4 to 400 bns / year @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of these well - modeled inspiralling systems is that a detection can be made tens of seconds before the merger if enough waveform cycles can be detected to boost the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "this could allow an _ extreme low - latency _ alert to be sent out to em facilities as near real - time as possible to catch the fading em signature .",
    "such prompt follow - ups could provide valuable insight into the inner workings of these cataclysmic events .    here",
    "we report on the results of a study conducted by chu et al .",
    "@xcite which examined the capability of a range of em instruments for rapid follow - ups from extreme low - latency gw triggers .",
    "we present here only the main results assuming an aligo / adv network at design sensitivity .",
    "we refer the interested reader to chu et al . for a complete analysis including results from larger gw network configurations .",
    "figure  [ fig_mm_scenarios ] summarises some of the popular scenarios for the expected em signatures from bns mergers .",
    "these are based on the proposed link between short duration gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) and the merger of of compact objects @xcite .",
    "the predictions are highly uncertain and could lead to various pathways and end products .",
    "the anticipated onset time , duration , and observable wavelengths are shown in the figure .",
    "figure  [ fig_mm_scenarios ] shows that sgrbs could be accompanied by an optical flash or a fast radio burst ( frb ) @xcite ; an frb could also result from the collapse of a merger product to a black hole @xcite .",
    "if a stable or supra - massive magnetar is formed , the long lived x - ray plateaus observed in many sgrbs could be the signature of direct dissipation of magnetar wind energy @xcite . at later times , predictions for an optical / ir kilonova @xcite are supported though recent observations @xcite . for a relatively small opacity",
    ", a kilonova precursor may also appear soon after the merger @xcite .",
    "since the initial ligo era a number of low - latency gw trigger - generation pipelines have been proposed and tested  @xcite .",
    "the low latency localization pipeline ` bayestar `  @xcite has shown that localization can be achieved in seconds with potential speed ups proportional to the number of cpu cores . for success ,",
    "wide - field em telescopes capable of rapid response within tens of seconds and with fields - of - view ( fov ) comparable to the error area of gw source sky directions ( of order hundreds of deg@xmath1 ) will be critical .     +    to test the em - follow up prospects we simulated a total of 200,000 bns sources , drawing free parameters of the waveform and the sky location of each event from standard distributions . around 10@xmath2",
    "bns detections were obtained and the localization accuracy of each was determined using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "detailed statistics of the detected sample are provided in chu et al .",
    "for an aligo / adv network the error region required to contain 50% of the detections , assuming sources are detected 40s before merger , was around 1000 deg@xmath3 .",
    "we assume this estimate , along with a 40s latency to send out the gw trigger .    to explore prompt",
    "em follow - up observations , we estimate the fluxes at different wavelengths by extrapolating data from observed em emissions associated with sgrbs and convert to 200 mpc .",
    "we then consider the fovs , sensitivities and response times for a range of em telescopes to estimate their ability to capture a prompt em signature .",
    "figure [ fig_mm_scenarios1 ] shows that at low frequency radio ( mwa @xcite ; fov:610deg@xmath1@150mhz ; response in tens of secs ) and both high and low - energy @xmath0-ray ( e.g. fermi @xcite ; gbm fov:30000deg@xmath1 , lat fov:6564deg@xmath1 ) the large fovs and the fast response potential of mwa show that post - prompt ( @xmath4 5s ) breakthrough observations could be realised @xcite . in the x - ray ,",
    "small fov instruments such as _ swift _ are hindered by the large gw error region ; a requirement for reconstructed sky locations to overlap with nearby galaxies @xcite could improve this situation .    in the optical , even for a wide field , fast response telecope like ztf ( @xcite ; fov:47deg@xmath1 ; exposure 30s ; 20.5 - 21 mag ) , to cover the 1000 deg@xmath1 error region with an exposure times of 30s would require hundreds of seconds .",
    "similar instruments will require sophisticated tiling strategies and would benefit from a co - ordinated observational scheme ( see @xcite for search strategies using the iptf ) .",
    "a wide fov x - ray instrument capable of rapid pointing , such as the nasa proposed 900 deg@xmath1 fov soft x - ray instrument iss - lobster @xcite , would be invaluable for such an approach .",
