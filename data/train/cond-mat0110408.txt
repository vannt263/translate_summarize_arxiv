    "among the uranium- based heavy fermion ( hf ) superconductors @xcite ( sc ) unconventional behaviour is the rule rather than the exception . in",
    "the canonical intermetallic u- compounds one observes orbitally degenerate sc states with associated double transition@xcite and two upper critical field curves as in the case of upt@xmath1 @xcite , furthermore coexistence and competition of different unconventinal sc states with a sdw- like state in the u@xmath3,th@xmath4be@xmath5 was reported @xcite .",
    "in addition uru@xmath0si@xmath0 shows superconductivity embedded in a region with a yet undetermined hidden order parameter @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "when antiferromagnetism ( af ) is observed it has no well defined long range order and is characterized by a very small moment size of order 10@xmath6 or less .",
    "the situation is distinctly different in the compound upd@xmath0al@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "its normal state is characterized by a specific heat @xmath7- value of 120 mj / mole k@xmath8 much smaller than observed in the previous compounds , it is therefore of only moderate hf character and is superconducting below t@xmath9=1.8 k. on the other hand it has long range af order below t@xmath10=14.3 k with much larger moments of almost atomic like size with @xmath11 .",
    "this indicates that in addition to the itinerant electrons there must be nearly localized 5f- electrons present .",
    "they result from the 5f@xmath8 configuration of the u@xmath12 ionic species which is the dominating one in this compound @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the temperature dependent susceptibility which shows an extremely strong hexagonal ac- anisotropy with an almost constant @xmath13 and a much larger @xmath14 which is strongly temperature dependent with a typical behaviour known from crystalline electric field ( cef)- split localized 5f states with a singlet- ( nonmagnetic ) ground state and a first excited state at an energy estimated as @xmath26 mev .",
    "knight shift analysis in the normal state obtained from @xmath15sr- experiments confirm the presence of localized 5f moments @xcite . since the cef ground state is a singlet the af order must be of the induced moment type , i.e. due to mixing with the first excited cef state caused by the inter- site exchange .",
    "the most direct confirmation for this dual nature of 5f- electrons in upd@xmath0al@xmath1  is obtained from inelastic neutron scattering experiments which have been able to identify the collective propagating excitations that originate in cef excitations of energy @xmath16 and are broadened into a dispersive band usually termed magnetic excitons due to the action of the intersite exchange . these modes",
    "extend up to 10 mev and for a wave vector along the hexagonal axis are quite sharp and well defined @xcite .",
    "more recently it was found @xcite that at the af wave vector @xmath17 in reduced units ( app .",
    "a ) a strong interaction of these collective modes of localized moments with the heavy conduction electrons exists which leads to a resonance- like structure in the dynamical structure function due to a near degeneracy of the exciton mode energy at @xmath18 and the superconducting gap . before that tunneling measurements",
    "@xcite have already shown that strong coupling anomalies in the tunneling current exist in the same energy range where the magnetic excitons at @xmath18 were found .",
    "this has lead to the conclusion that they are indeed the bosonic glue which is responsible for the formation of cooper pairs in this compound @xcite .",
    "the argument is quite analogous to the strong coupling conventional electron - phonon superconductors where the phonon spectrum known from inelastic neutron scattering leaves its imprint on the sc tunneling spectrum .",
    "upd@xmath0al@xmath1  is therefore the first case of an unconventional hf superconductor where a similar comparison has lead to the identification of the pairing mechanism , in this case the pairing is mediated by the exchange of magnetic excitons .    in the present work this novel type of pairing mechanism",
    "is investigated in detail .",
    "it is different from both the electron- phonon mechanism in conventional superconductors and from the spin fluctuation mechanism which is commonly assumed to be present in the unconventional superconductors with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the former is mediated by slightly damped real frequency bosons ( phonons ) which do not couple to the spin degrees of freedom , thus allowing only for spin singlet pairs .",
    "the latter is mediated by strongly overdamped spin- fluctuations , i.e. bosons with purely imaginary frequency which couple to conduction electron spins in a rotationally invariant manner and in principle allow for both spin singlet and triplet pairing .",
    "the new pairing mechanism discussed here has distinctly different features : it is mediated by magnetic excitons which are real frequency , propagating bosonic modes that couple to the conduction electron spin , however in a way which explicitly breaks spin rotational invariance due to the presence of the cef splitting . together with the effect of the af order parameter this will lead to a complete splitting of triplet states resulting in nondegenerate odd parity pair states .",
    "it is the aim of this work to study within a generic dual model of 5f electrons ( sect .",
    "ii ) the magnetic exciton bands ( sect .",
    "iii ) and the associated pair potential ( sect .iv ) of this mechanism , incorporating both the localized cef states which originate from the 5f@xmath8 configuration of the u@xmath12 state of upd@xmath0al@xmath1  and the conduction electrons .",
    "furthermore the gap equations and their explicit solutions together with their node line structure for a quasi one dimensional model are discussed explicitly ; it is also shown how the presence of the af background influences the gap structure and lifts the degeneracy ( sect .v ) .",
    "finally we discuss a hybrid model including also the usual spin fluctuation contribution ( sect .",
    "vi ) and a summary and outlook is given in section vii .",
    "the pronounced susceptibility anisotropy of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 with an almost constant @xmath13 and a strongly temperature dependent @xmath19(t ) with a maximum at t=50 k is perhaps the most direct evidence for the presence of localised cef- states @xcite .",

    "however later it was found @xcite that this can not explain the temperature dependence of the staggered magnetisation and a singlet- doublet system was proposed instead .",
    "the magnetic excitations are very similar for both cef systems except for a small difference in their temperature dependence . for simplicity",
    "we therefore use the singlet - singlet system with the ground state @xmath21 ( 0 mev ) and excited state @xmath22 ( @xmath16= 6 mev ) . the value of @xmath16 is obtained from a fit to the experimental excitations ( sect.iv ) and is close to the one obtained from the temperature variation of susceptibility and af order parameter @xcite . all higher cef levels starting at @xmath23 10 mev",

    "the third term describes a possible superexchange j@xmath43= 4(g-1)@xmath8t@xmath44/u between the localised 5f- electrons due to their remaining finite inter- site hopping t@xmath43 .",
    "the last term finally represents the exchange interaction which couples the itinerant and localised 5f- electrons of the dual model .",
    "the total effective inter- site exchange between localized 5f- moments is then given by its fourier transform as    @xmath45    where the second ( rkky ) part is in principle determined by the static conduction electron susceptibility @xmath46 .",
    "however in the following @xmath47 will be treated as an empirical quantity to be parametrized by fitting the actually observed magnetic excitations to the theoretical predictions based on the dual hamiltonian of eq.([ham ] ) .",

    "is nonmagnetic , i.e. @xmath49 0 .",
    "nevertheless magnetic moments may appear spontaneously at t@xmath10 if the effective exchange is strong enough to mix the excited state @xmath22 into the ground state @xmath21 .",
    "the mixed state @xmath50 will then have nonzero moment due to the nondiagonal matrix element @xmath51=2@xmath38 .",
    "in this case the af transition is preceded by the softening of a magnetic exciton mode at the af wave vector ( @xmath17 in upd@xmath0al@xmath1  ) .",
    "the magnetic exciton mode can be interpreted as originating from local cef- excitations @xmath52 with energy @xmath16 which propagate from site to site due to the effective exchange and this process leads to the magnetic exciton dispersion .",
    "it is therefore a collective excitation of localized 5f- cef states and may be obtained from the second and third term in eq.([ham ] ) but taking the total effective exchange of eq.([eff ] ) instead . within the two singlet subspace this leads to a hamiltonian    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the uniaxial exchange tensor of eq.([eff ] ) ) with j@xmath55= j@xmath56=j@xmath57 and j@xmath55=j@xmath58 .",
