    "although discovered much earlier than the afterglow , the emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) themselves , usually called the grb _ prompt emission _ , is still poorly understood .",
    "the main uncertainties lie in several open questions in the grb physics @xcite :    * what is the composition of the grb jet ? * what is the energy dissipation mechanism in the jet ? * where is the region of energy dissipation and prompt emission ? * what is the particle acceleration mechanism in the energy dissipation region ?",
    "* what is the radiation mechanism of the particles ?    among these , the answer to the first question is more fundamental , which decides or at least strongly affects the answers to the rest of the questions .",
    "the traditional `` fireball '' model envisages a thermally - driven explosion , with gravitational energy released during a catastrophic event ( such as massive star core collapse or merger of two compact stars ) being deposited in the form of thermal heat at the base of the central engine .",
    "this fireball then expands under its own thermal pressure and gets accelerated to a relativistic speed , if baryon contamination in the ejecta is low enough @xcite .",
    "most of the thermal energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the outflow @xcite , with some thermal energy released as photons at the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the outflow is further dissipated in the internal shocks @xcite and in the external ( forward and reverse ) shocks as the ejecta is decelerated by the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the former powers the grb prompt emission , while the latter powers the afterglow @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the matter - dominated fireball picture , an opposite opinion is that the entire grb phenomenology is electromagnetic .",
    "this is the electromagnetic ( em ) model of grbs @xcite . here",
    "the magnetic field plays the dominant role in ejecta dynamics .",
    "little baryons are loaded from the central engine , so that an extremely high value of @xmath1 ( ratio between poynting flux and matter flux , or ratio between comoving magnetic energy density and rest mass energy density ) is invoked .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath1 remains extremely high ( @xmath2 ) at the deceleration radius , so that the `` sub - alfvenic '' condition @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow ) is satisfied . within this scenario ,",
    "the magnetic energy is directly converted to the particle energy and radiation energy through current instability around the deceleration radius .",
    "such a scenario requires that the ejecta maintains high magnetization throughout , which is very difficult to achieve in reality .",
    "more realistically , the grb ejecta may carry both a matter component and a magnetic component .",
    "this results in a wide range of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of grbs @xcite .",
    "a real question is how high the @xmath1 parameter is .",
    "since @xmath1 is a function of radius ( magnetic acceleration and dissipation can constantly change @xmath1 in the flow ) , a more relevant question would be how high the @xmath1 parameter is at the grb emission site .",
    "the complication is that one is not sure about the location of the grb prompt emission radius @xmath5 ( see next section ) .",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 are mutually dependent ( and also depend on a third parameter , i.e. @xmath7 at the central engine ) .",
    "different grb prompt emission models invoke different combinations of these parameters .",
    "observationally , the currently available information of grb prompt emission includes the following aspects .",
    "a successful model should be able to interpret them .",
    "* grb lightcurves are extremely diverse @xcite",
    ". some are spiky , while some others are smooth .",
    "some have multiple ( sometimes well separated ) spiky episodes , while some others have one or two smooth pulses .",
    "some are very long , while some others are very short .",
    "at least some lightcurves can be decomposed as the superposition of a fast and a slow component@xcite .",
    "* grb spectra can be well characterized . for most grbs , both",
    "the time - integrated and time - resolved spectra can be described by a so - called `` band '' function , i.e. a smoothly - joint broken power law function characterized by three parameters : the low - energy and high - energy photon indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as the peak energy @xmath10 in the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "recent fermi lat / gbm observations suggest that such a component dominates in nearly 7 orders of magnitude in energy in most grbs @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", growing evidence suggests that this phenomenological function can not fully account for the observations , and two additional spectral components , i.e. a quasi - thermal bump and a high - energy power - law component , are needed to fit the time - resolved data of bright grbs @xcite . *",
    "the peak energy @xmath10 varies in a wide range , from as high as 15 mev in grb 110721a @xcite to below 10 kev in grb 060218 @xcite .",
    "it can evolve rapidly within a same burst , and two patterns can be identified : hard - to - soft evolution throughout a pulse or @xmath10 intensity tracking @xcite .",
    "* grb polarization measurements have been made for some grbs . even though not with very high significance , evidence of high linear polarization degree for at least some bright grbs has been collected @xcite .",
    "the available data do not have `` smoking gun '' criteria to differentiate among the different models .",
    "nonetheless , some available data already brought useful clues , serving as `` finger prints '' to diagnose the underlying physics of grb prompt emission .",
    "before discussing the open questions and debates , it is informative to list various prompt emission models and their properties . in the following ,",
    "we first categorize the models based on the location of grb emission , i.e. the radius of emission from the central engine @xmath5 .",
    "swift observations of early x - ray afterglow suggest that the prompt emission site is `` internal '' ( below the external shock where the jet is decelerated ) @xcite .",
    "the emission site is therefore bracketed between the photosphere radius @xmath11 ( below which photons are opaque ) and the deceleration radius @xmath12 ( above which the jet decelerates due to jet - medium interaction ) . in the literature , several possible emission sites have been proposed . from small to large , they are , respectively ,    * photosphere radius @xmath11 : this radius is defined by the optically thin condition for electron thomson scattering , i.e. the last scattering surface of photons originally trapped in the ejecta .",
    "the radius depends on luminosity @xmath13 , lorentz factor @xmath4 , and the latitude with respect to the observer .",
    "for example , for a matter dominated outflow with photosphere radius above the coasting radius and for an on - axis observer , one has @xcite @xmath14 , where the convention @xmath15 has been used . considering angle - dependence of the optical depth ,",
    "one gets a concave photosphere shape with respect to the line of sight @xcite . *",
    "internal shock radius @xmath16 : for a characteristic central engine variability time @xmath17 and lorentz factor @xmath4 , the internal shock radius can be estimated as @xcite @xmath18 . since there is a range of @xmath17 in a grb lightcurve , internal shocks can actually spread in a wide range of radii .",
    "* fast reconnection switch radius @xmath19 : if the outflow is magnetically dominated at small radii and the field configuration is _ striped - wind - like _ , mckinney & uzdensky @xcite argued that a switch from the slow , collisional reconnection regime to the fast , collisionless reconnection regime occurs at around a radius @xmath20 cm .",
    "the grb emission is assumed to occur at this radius , which is above the photosphere . *",
    "internal - collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence radius @xmath21 : if the outflow is magnetically dominated at small radii and the field configuration is _ helical _ , zhang & yan @xcite argued that rapid discharge of magnetic energy can not be realized until the field lines are distorted enough through repetitive collisions .",
    "this radius is at least the internal shock radius ( where collisions start ) , and should have a typical value @xmath22 cm . within this model , the slow variability component",
    "is related to the central engine activity , while the fast variability component is related to mini - jets due to relativistic turbulent reconnection @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "so the emission radius may be estimated as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 s is the variability time scale for the `` slow '' variability component .",
    "* deceleration radius @xmath12 : the deceleration radius @xmath25 is defined by the condition that the momentum collected from the ambient medium is comparable to the momentum in the jet . for a constant density medium ,",
    "this is typically @xmath26 .",
    "the electromagnetic model of grbs @xcite invokes current instabilities at this radius to power the observed grbs .",
    "this is the largest radius allowed by the `` internal '' requirement of grb prompt emission .    keeping in mind of various emission radii , in the literature",
    "the following grb prompt emission models have been discussed .",
    "the requirements for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each model are summarized in table 1 .    *",
    "the fireball internal shock model @xcite : this is the standard theoretical framework .",
    "there are two emission sites in the model : the photosphere and the internal shocks .",
    "the magnetization parameter is @xmath27 in both locations . * the magnetized engine - internal shock model : some authors interpret the observed grb spectrum as synchrotron emission from the internal shocks only @xcite .",
    "an underlying assumption of such a model is that the photosphere emission is suppressed .",
    "this may appeal to a magnetized central engine @xcite .",
    "so the requirement of this model is @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "some authors claim that it is possible that at the central engine @xmath30 , while at both the photosphere radius and internal shocks one has @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "such a rapid magnetic acceleration has not been seen in numerical simulations . * the dissipative photosphere model : many authors @xcite argued that the observed grb band spectrum is simply the emission from the grb photosphere . in order to reconcile the theoretically expected spectrum ( quasi - thermal ) and the data",
    ", one needs to introduce energy dissipation around the photosphere , probably due to internal shocks , proton - neutron collisions , or magnetic reconnections .",
    "non - thermal electrons accelerated from the dissipative photosphere upscatter the seed thermal photons to make it non - thermal .",
    "the internal shock emission is neglected in this model .",
    "several sub - categories of dissipative photosphere models have been discussed in the literature : * * collisional heating model@xcite : heating of photosphere is maintained via nuclear and/or coulomb collisions . in this model",
    ", one has @xmath31 ( to facilitate coulomb collisions ) . *",
    "* magnetic dissipation model@xcite : heating is maintained by magnetic reconnection near the photosphere .",
    "a striped - wind magnetic field configuration is required in order to facilitate rapid reconnection at such a small radius . to make efficient magnetic heating",
    ", one needs to have @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is too high , the photosphere luminosity is suppressed by a factor @xmath35 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath34 is too low , the energy released via magnetic dissipation is small compared with the jet luminosity , so that the heating effect is not significant . * * jet - envelope interaction model@xcite : for long - duration grbs that are believed to be associated with deaths of massive stars , a relativistic jet needs to penetrate through the stellar envelope first .",
    "the interaction between the jet and the stellar envelope inevitably introduces dissipation ( through processes such as kelvin - helmholtz instabilities or collimation shocks ) .",
    "this dissipated energy can heat up the photosphere . in order to make such a mechanism effective",
    ", the photosphere can not be too far away from the outer boundary of the stellar envelope .",
    "otherwise photons would be quickly `` thermalized '' before reaching the photosphere .",
    "* the internal collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) model : this model @xcite invokes a large emission radius @xmath36 . once fast reconnection is triggered , the magnetic dissipation proceeds in a run - away manner .",
    "the magnetization parameter @xmath37 when icmart starts , and @xmath38 when icmart is completed . *",
    "the magnetic reconnection switch model : this model @xcite has @xmath39 to begin with , with @xmath1 continuously reducing with radius . * the current instability model : this model @xcite invokes @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath1 value remains large beyond the dissipation radius .",
    "to ease further discussion below , we first discuss how @xmath1 ( and @xmath4 ) may evolve with radius @xmath41 .    in general , a grb jet launched from the central engine may have two components , one `` hot '' component due to neutrino heating from the accretion disk or the proto neutron star , and a `` cold '' component related to a magnetic poynting flux launched from the black hole or the neutron star@xcite .",
    "the central engine can be characterized by a parameter @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the luminosities of the hot component , cold component ( @xmath46 is the poynting flux luminosity ) , and the entire wind , respectively . the parameter @xmath7 is defined as @xmath47 for a variable central engine , all the parameters are a function of @xmath48 . for simplicity , we do not introduce this @xmath48-dependence , but focus on the @xmath41-dependence of all the parameters .    after escaping from the central engine ,",
    "the jet undergoes thermal acceleration and magnetic acceleration and gains bulk lorentz factor . at any radius @xmath41",
    ", the flow can be categorized by a parameter @xmath49 where @xmath4 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath50 is the total co - moving energy per baryon ( @xmath51 is the thermal energy ) , and @xmath1 is the ratio between comoving cold ( magnetic ) and hot ( matter ) energy densities . considering a completely cold magnetized outflow , i.e. @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and assuming no magnetic dissipation along the way , one would have @xmath54 in reality , thermal energy is inevitable , especially when the magnetic energy is dissipated .",
    "about half of the dissipated energy is trapped in the system as thermal energy ( the other half used to accelerate the flow ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath55 would decrease from the original @xmath56 when photons escape from the system ( e.g. at the photosphere and other dissipation radii above the photosphere ) . in some models",
    "( e.g. icmart @xcite ) , magnetic dissipation proceeds in a run - away manner , so that @xmath1 and @xmath55 can drop quickly around a certain radius @xmath41 , and copious photons are released from the system to power the prompt emission .",
    "a thermally driven fireball has a simple @xmath4-evolution history @xcite : initially the lorentz factor @xmath4 increases linearly with @xmath41 until reaching the maximum lorentz factor essentially defined by central engine baryon loading .",
    "the lorentz factor then `` coasts '' to the maximum value , reduces at the internal shocks ( due to loss of radiation energy ) , and finally decreases smoothly as a power law beyond the deceleration radius .",
    "a magnetically - driven jet undergoes a more complicated evolution history @xcite : for a magnetically dominated jet with initial magnetization @xmath7 ( @xmath52 ) , the jet would first undergo a rapid acceleration until reaching @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and then go through a very slow acceleration process .",
    "the fastest acceleration proceeds as @xmath60 , either via continuous magnetic dissipation @xcite or via an `` impulsive acceleration '' of a short pulse @xcite . ideally , one reaches the maximum lorentz factor @xmath61 at the coasting radius @xmath62 .",
    "however , the jet may start to decelerate before reaching the coasting radius if @xmath7 is large enough so that @xmath63 . also magnetic dissipation can reduce the final coasting @xmath4 , since energy is released as prompt emission .",
    "the @xmath4-evolution of a hybrid system ( with both thermal energy and magnetic energy at the central engine ) is more complicated , and has not been studied carefully in the literature . since thermal acceleration proceeds more rapidly , it would be reasonable to assume that the thermal energy gets converted to kinetic energy first , after which additional acceleration proceeds magnetically if @xmath7 is large enough .",
    "this is effectively to ask : how high is @xmath6 ?",
    "the two opponents in the debate and their corresponding arguments are summarized as follows :    * low @xmath6 ( fireball internal shock model ; magnetized engine internal shock model , collisional heating photosphere model @xcite : * * the low-@xmath1 model is the simplest , and seems to work reasonably well ; * * we know the physics well , and give more robust predictions ; * * internal shocks and nuclear collisions are naturally expected in a grb fireball ; * * even if the central engine is magnetized , one could have fast magnetic acceleration so that @xmath1 is brought below unity so that internal shocks can dissipate the kinetic energy . *",
    "moderate to high @xmath6 ( magnetic heating photosphere model , icmart model , reconnection switch model , current instability model @xcite : * * the broad - band spectra of grb 080916c show a dominant band - component covering 6 - 7 orders of magnitude . assuming this is the internal shock component , the predicted photosphere component outshines the observed emission @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the simplest fireball internal shock model does not explain the data at least for this grb .",
    "this would require a magnetized jet model with suppressed photosphere emission @xcite .",
    "a good candidate is the icmart model @xcite . * * one way to overcome this difficulty is to introduce a magnetized central engine to suppress the photosphere emission , but demands that the magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy before internal shocks take place .",
    "however , various studies suggest that magnetic acceleration is not an efficient process @xcite .",
    "it is essentially impossible to have @xmath64 , while @xmath32 . *",
    "* the internal shock model itself suffers a list of difficulties ( see e.g. @xcite for a summary ) : low radiative efficiency , fast cooling , too many electrons to interpret @xmath10 , not easy to interpret the @xmath65 @xcite and @xmath66 @xcite relations . the difficulties can be overcome if the flow is magnetically dominated and dissipation is through the icmart process .",
    "this question is closely related to debate i. if indeed one can have @xmath29 , then internal shocks would accelerate electrons to the desired energy to power grb prompt emission .",
    "recent particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations have shown that magnetic relativistic shocks are not good at accelerating electrons @xcite . for an electron - ion plasma ,",
    "efficient electron acceleration is possible only when @xmath67 for relativistic shocks @xcite . for mildly relativistic shocks",
    "the constraint is less stringent @xcite . in any case , in order to make internal shocks efficient accelerators , one has double constraints : a not - too - high @xmath1 and a not - too - strong shock .",
    "the latter constraint further limits the already low dissipation efficiency of shocks .",
    "if @xmath68 , the particle acceleration mechanism is likely through magnetic reconnection . in this case ,",
    "internal shocks can help to facilitate rapid reconnection @xcite .",
    "this question is related to the origin of the `` band '' spectral component observed in most grbs , which is dominant spectral component of grb prompt emission .",
    "the two leading interpretations invoke completely different radiation mechanisms .",
    "one scenario interprets the spectrum as upscattered quasi - thermal emission from the photosphere , with @xmath10 essentially defined by the photosphere temperature .",
    "the other scenario interprets the spectrum as non - thermal emission in the optically thin region .",
    "the arguments for each of the above two scenarios include the following :    * quasi - thermal ( dissipative photosphere models @xcite ) : this model interprets the band component as modified thermal emission from the photosphere .",
    "the broadening mechanism includes both physical broadening ( compton upscattering of the seed thermal photons ) and geometric broadening ( the effect of equal - arrival - time volume ) @xcite .",
    "the arguments that have been raised to support this scenario include : * * the observed @xmath10 distribution among grbs is narrow , all around mev range and below .",
    "the photosphere temperature is in this range , and does not sensitively depend on luminosity @xcite ; * * the `` broadness '' of the grb spectra around @xmath10 , which can be described by a band function , is relatively `` narrow '' ( compared with the synchrotron peak of other objects , such as blazars ) .",
    "so it is likely of a thermal origin @xcite . *",
    "* the photosphere model can interpret @xcite the amati relation @xcite and other correlations , including a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath69 or @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "* * the photosphere emission has a high efficiency .",
    "it is hard to avoid a bright photosphere . *",
    "non - thermal ( e.g. internal shock model , icmart model , @xcite ) : this model interprets the band component as non - thermal emission of electrons , such as synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton .",
    "the arguments in support of this scenario include the following : * * the observed @xmath10 distribution among grbs is actually not that narrow .",
    "considering x - ray flashes ( the softer grbs ) , @xmath10 can distribute from above mev to the kev range .",
    "more importantly , @xmath10 can evolve rapidly within a same grb .",
    "one can define a `` death line '' in the @xmath71 domain for the dissipative photosphere model that interprets @xmath10 as the temperature of the outflow @xcite .",
    "grb 110721a shows a very high @xmath72 mev early on @xcite , which is well above the `` death line '' @xcite .",
    "this rules out the thermal origin of @xmath10 at least for this burst ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the band function parameters are typical among other grbs , this would suggest that the band component in most other grbs may be also of a non - thermal ( e.g. synchrotron ) origin . * * due to a small emission radius , the grb spectrum predicted in the photosphere model can not extend to above gev ( due to photon - photon pair production opacity ) . in some grbs ( e.g. grb 080916c ) , the band component extends to much higher energies @xcite .",
    "one counter - argument would be that the gev emission is of an external shock origin@xcite .",
    "however , it is now clear that the gev afterglow only sets in after the end of prompt emission @xcite , and during the prompt emission phase , the gev emission tracks the variability in the sub mev regime and should have an internal origin . * * a major difficulty of the photosphere model is that it predicts too hard a low - energy spectrum ( with @xmath73@xcite ) to match the observed @xmath74 spectrum .",
    "several efforts to soften the spectrum has been made .",
    "synchrotron radiation is introduced to contribute to emission below @xmath10 .",
    "however , the predicted spectrum @xcite does not have the correct shape to interpret the data .",
    "in particular , for a softer low energy spectrum , the high energy spectrum is also softened , a behavior not observed from the data .",
    "2 . if the high - latitude emission dominates the spectrum , due to the geometric broadening effect one can get @xmath74 @xcite . however , during the prompt emission phase , new materials are continuously ejected , whose emission outshines the high - latitude contribution .",
    "the predicted spectrum is still too hard to interpret the data during most of the prompt emission phase .",
    "3 . by introducing a special form of angular structured of the jet , one can reproduce @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the special form of the structured jet requires that the luminosity keeps constant in a wide range of angle , while the bulk lorentz factor drops with angle as a power law .",
    "such a jet structure is most helpful to enhance the high - latitude emission , since a low @xmath4 from the wing allows a wide @xmath75 cone to contribute to the on - axis observer .",
    "the high - luminosity in the wing ( high latitude ) then significantly contributes to the observed emission and therefore softens the spectrum .",
    "it is however not known how typical such a jet structure is .",
    "if both luminosity and lorentz factor have an angular structure , the photosphere spectrum would then not so different from the uniform jet case , which predicts a harder spectrum .",
    "* * the dissipative photosphere models require some tuning of parameters .",
    "for example , the magnetic dissipation model requires @xmath76 to be around unity to assure a high radiation efficiency ; and the requirement of thermalization poses stringent constraints on the value of lorentz factor @xcite . * * three independent clues ( gev extension , x - ray tail , and optical association ) all point towards a large emission radius @xmath5 for grbs @xcite .",
    "although for each argument one has to make the assumption that the sub - mev emission comes from the same region as the emission from the other wavelength , when combining all three criteria , it is rather unlikely that only sub - mev emission comes from the photosphere while emission from other three bands are all from a larger radius . *",
    "* synchrotron models also predict @xmath77 given that the emission radius @xmath5 is not very different from burst to burst @xcite .",
    "this may be satisfied for the icmart model @xcite .",
    "other correlations @xcite can be interpreted with a high-@xmath1 central engine model @xcite that invokes the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite . *",
    "* very rapid hard - to - soft @xmath10 evolution during the rising phase of the leading grb pulse @xcite could be a big challenge to the photosphere model , but can be interpreted within the framework of synchrotron radiation model @xcite . * * in several grbs a quasi - thermal component is found in superposition with the band component @xcite , whose temporal evolution is consistent with the photosphere origin @xcite .",
    "if this component is of the photosphere origin , then the main band component must be another component .",
    "since the band component extends to below the quasi - thermal component , it must not be self - absorbed in the emission region , which means @xmath78 , i.e. the band component comes from an optically - thin region far above the photosphere .",
    "two leading non - thermal radiation mechanisms to interpret grb prompt emission are synchrotron radiation @xcite and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) .",
    "the ssc mechanism was particularly suggested to interpret the prompt optical emission of the `` naked - eye '' grb 080319b , whose flux significantly exceeds the low - energy extrapolation of the gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "further studies suggest that this mechanism is disfavored due the following arguments : 1 .",
    "a dominant ssc component usually predicts an even more dominant 2nd - order ssc component , which greatly adds to the total energy budget of grbs @xcite ; 2 .",
    "this mechanism predicts a strong optical flash .",
    "however , observations show that the case of grb 080319b is rare .",
    "most prompt optical flux is consistent with or below the low - energy extension of gamma - rays @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the gamma - ray lightcurve of grb 080319b is much more variable than the optical lightcurve .",
    "simulations suggest that the ssc and synchrotron lightcurves show show similar degree of variability @xcite .",
    "besides these criticisms , in general , the ssc mechanism predicts a broader @xmath10 distribution than the synchrotron mechanism due to its sensitive dependence on the electron lorentz factor @xmath79 ( 4th power as compared with 2nd power for the synchrotron mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron mechanism is known to power non - thermal emission of many other astrophysical phenomena ( e.g. blazars , micro - quasars , supernova remnants , pulsar - wind nebulae ) . within the grb context",
    ", the main criticism has been the fast - cooling problem .",
    "since the magnetic field strength is strong in the grb prompt emission region , electrons lose energy in a time scale much shorter than the dynamical time scale .",
    "traditionally , it was believed that the spectral index below the injection energy due to fast cooling gives a photon index -1.5 , too soft to account for the typical value @xmath80 @xcite . this has been regarded as a main criticism against the synchrotron mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently , a breakthrough was made in modeling synchrotron radiation in grbs . by introducing a decrease of magnetic field with radius ( e.g. due to flux conservation in a conical jet , probably with additional magnetic dissipation ) ,",
    "a natural physical ingredient previously ignored in modeling synchrotron cooling , uhm & zhang@xcite found that a low - energy spectrum of the fast - cooling synchrotron spectrum is typically harder than -1.5 . by varying model parameters ( e.g. the decay index @xmath81 and the magnetic field normalization @xmath82 at radius @xmath83 cm from the central engine , convention @xmath84 ) , one can reproduce a range of @xmath8 centered around @xmath80 , with a distribution from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "more interestingly , within the typical bandpass of grb detectors , the synchrotron model spectrum is close to the phenomenological band function ( fig.1 ) . as a result , we suggest that fast - cooling synchrotron is likely the dominant mechanism that shapes the `` band '' component of the observed grb spectra .",
    "fermi lat detected emission in the gev range from a sample of bright grbs .",
    "two important features of the gev emission is that some of them have a delayed onset and the emission typically decays as a power law @xcite .",
    "this led to the suggestion that the gev emission is from the external shock @xcite .",
    "further studies suggest that the external shock interpretation applies to phase when the mev prompt emission is over . during the prompt emission phase",
    ", the gev emission should still have an internal origin @xcite .",
    "several suggestions have been proposed to interpret the delayed onset , e.g. delayed onset of the hadronic component @xcite and delayed onset of ic scattering off the cocoon photons @xcite . on the other hand , the data can be understood in terms of gradual decrease of pair - production opacity @xcite , which may be achieved in a scenario invoking slow acceleration of a magnetized jet @xcite .    a hadronic origin of prompt emission has been discussed in the literature @xcite . in order to have a dominant hadronic emission component , the proton - to - electron energy ratio has to be large @xcite , which greatly increases the energy budget of the bursts .",
    "such a high proton fraction is already constrained by the non - detection of neutrinos from grbs by icecube @xcite .",
    "combining insights gained from multi - wavelength data and theoretical modeling , one may draw the following global picture regarding the origin of grb prompt emission :    * the band spectral component originates from an optically thin region with a non - thermal emission mechanism , very likely synchrotron radiation .",
    "fast cooling synchrotron radiation in a decreasing magnetic field gives a simple picture to interpret the band component , including its typical -1 low energy photon index @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may introduce slow cooling @xcite or slow heating due to magnetic turbulence @xcite to achieve the right low - energy spectral index . *",
    "the photosphere component has been observed : it can dominate the spectrum in rare cases such as grb 090902b @xcite , but mostly show up as a superposed bump in the low - energy wing of the band component @xcite , or is essentially suppressed ( e.g. in grb 080916c @xcite ) . *",
    "the diverse spectral behavior of grb prompt emission may be related to different @xmath7 values at the central engine @xcite .",
    "if @xmath7 is small enough , one can have a dominant photosphere spectrum as observed in grb 090902b @xcite . if @xmath7 is moderately high , the photosphere emission is not completely suppressed , and can have contribution to the observed spectra along with the non - thermal emission from the optically thin region .",
    "this applies to the cases such as grb 100724b @xcite and grb 110721a @xcite . finally ,",
    "if @xmath7 is high enough , the photosphere emission is greatly suppressed , and the observed spectrum is dominated by the non - thermal band component arising from the magnetic dissipation ( e.g. icmart ) region .",
    "so far the observational clues are limited to the spectra and lightcurves of grb prompt emission .",
    "other observational clues can help to further test and constrain the models .",
    "photon polarization is essential to diagnose jet composition , geometric configuration , and radiation mechanism of grb jets @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath87 polarized gamma - ray signals have been detected in 3 bright grbs @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization is typically very high ( several tens of percent ) .",
    "this immediately disfavors the internal shock model that invokes random magnetic fields in the shocked region ( due to plasma instabilities ) and the non - structured low-@xmath1 photosphere models .",
    "models invoking dissipation of ordered magnetic fields , e.g. @xcite , are favored .",
    "a structured jet photosphere model may also produce polarized photons via compton scattering , but the polarization degree would have a different energy - dependence from the synchrotron model in ordered magnetic fields",
    ". a high - sensitivity gamma - ray polarimeter with a wide band - pass to detect energy - dependent polarization signals is essential to constrain these models .",
    "the icecube collaboration has placed a more and more stringent high - energy neutrino flux from grbs @xcite .",
    "the upper limit starts to challenge the conventional internal shock model @xcite .",
    "a model - dependent study of the grb neutrino models @xcite suggests that the neutrino signal would be stronger in the photosphere models than the internal shock model given a same cosmic - ray - to - gamma - ray flux ratio ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if neutrinos are still not detected from grbs in the next several years , then the dissipative photosphere models that invoke proton acceleration would be further constrained .",
    "models invoking magnetic dissipation at a large radius @xcite are well consistent with the neutrino flux upper limit constraint , and would be supported if neutrinos continue not to be detected to accompany grbs in the future .",

    "<S> the origin of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) prompt emission , bursts of @xmath0-rays lasting from shorter than one second to thousands of seconds , remains not fully understood after more than 40 years of observations . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties lie in several open questions in the grb physics , including jet composition , energy dissipation mechanism , particle acceleration mechanism , and radiation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> recent broad - band observations of prompt emission with fermi sharpen the debates in these areas , which stimulated intense theoretical investigations invoking very different ideas . </S>",
    "<S> i will review these debates , and argue that the current data suggest the following picture : a quasi - thermal spectral component originating from the photosphere of the relativistic ejecta has been detected in some grbs . even though in some cases ( e.g. grb 090902b ) this component dominates the spectrum , in most grbs , this component either forms a sub - dominant `` shoulder '' spectral component in the low energy spectral regime of the more dominant `` band '' component , or is not detectable at all . the main `` band '' spectral component likely originates from the optically thin region due to synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the diverse magnetization in the grb central engine is likely the origin of the observed diverse prompt emission properties among bursts . </S>"
