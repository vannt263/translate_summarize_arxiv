    "the magnetic field plays key roles in a variety of dynamical processes , particularly in eruptive phenomena such as filament eruptions , flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "the topological structure is an important properties of spatial magnetic field .",
    "therefore it is important to understand three - dimensional properties of magnetic field in order to elaborate efficient theoretical models , which will contribute to understand solar activity . at present ,",
    "due to the restrictions of observational technique , we can not get the accurate information on magnetic field in the hot and tenuous corona .",
    "this can only be done at the level of the cooler and denser photosphere . in spite of that",
    ", the extrapolation of magnetograms , measured maps of the photospheric or low chromospheric field , into the corona is the most important technique to supply the missing information about the spatial magnetic field .",
    "the field extrapolation is based on force - free assumption ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which assumes that the corona is free of lorentz forces . for the low-@xmath3 corona where the plasma is tenuous",
    ", the force - free assumption is appropriate .",
    "the force - free field obeys the following equations : @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath0 is called force - free factor .",
    "if @xmath0 = 0 , the equations represent a potential field ( a current - free field ) .",
    "if @xmath0 = constant , they describe a current - carrying linear force - free ( lff ) field , and if @xmath0 = @xmath6 it is a general nlff field .",
    "this two equations also imply that : @xmath7 equation ( @xmath8 ) demonstrates that @xmath0 is invariant along field lines of @xmath9 .",
    "the scalar @xmath0 is in general a function of space and identifies how much current flows along each field line .",
    "thus , the deviations of @xmath0 along one field line at some extent can demonstrate performance of field extrapolation .    at present",
    ", the potential ( @xmath0 = 0 ) and linear force - free ( @xmath0 = constant ) field extrapolations reached a mature development , but they describe the magnetic field above the photosphere in a very restricted manner . according to the practice conditions of solar magnetic field , it is not a current - free field and nlff should be more reasonable .",
    "recently , several nlff field extrapolation methods have been proposed ( @xmath10 , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the performance of above extrapolation methods have been studied in several papers ( @xmath11 @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) , comparing to models or observations ( @xmath10 , the appearance of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray or loops ) those methods above mentioned can give reasonable results at the level of macroscopic structure .    since the field extrapolation is an important technique to study the coronal magnetic field ,",
    "the performance of field extrapolation become special importance . from equation ( @xmath8 )",
    ", it can been seen that though @xmath0 may change from one field line to another , it must be a constant along one field line .",
    "knowing @xmath0 is an important parameter worthy to be researched , in this paper the distributions of @xmath0 between extrapolated field and semi - analytical field are compared ; the calculation error of @xmath0 is discussed ; the performance of @xmath0 along field line are studied specially .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : firstly , the description of extrapolation methods and semi - analytical field will be introduced in section  [ s - alg ] ; secondly , the results of distribution comparison and calculation error of force - free factor @xmath0 are shown in section  [ s - result ] ; at last , the short discussions and conclusions will be given in section  [ s - conl ] .",
    "the approximate vertical integration ( avi ) method ( @xcite , @xcite ) was improved from the vertical integration proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ) . in this method",
    ", it is assumed that the magnetic field components is given by the following formula , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 assuming the second - order continuous partial derivatives in a certain height range , 0@xmath15h ( h is the calculated height from the photospheric surface ) . in equations ( [ q - avi1])-([q - avi2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 mainly depend on @xmath18 and slowly vary with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 mainly depend on @xmath19 and @xmath20 and weakly vary with @xmath18 . after constructing the magnetic field ,",
    "the following integration equations , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 can be used to calculate extrapolated field .",
    "there exists singularity problem due to differential operation for avi method , hence we smooth data locally where exists singularity ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ) .      the boundary integral equation ( bie )",
    "method proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ) , which uses the integration function to extrapolate the magnetic field . in this method , an optimized parameter @xmath27 , which is the function of spatial position @xmath28 , must be found through iteration .",
    "the integral @xmath29 \\textbf{b}_{0}(x , y , 0 ) } { 2\\pi[(x - x_{i})^2+(y - y_{i})^2+z_{i}^2]^{3/2}},\\ ] ] is used to calculate the magnetic field , where @xmath30 = @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath32 is the magnetic field of photospheric surface .",
    "this method is to find suitable values of @xmath27 through iteration and try to make sure that the extrapolated field is force - free and divergence - free ( _ cf . _ @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization ( opt . ) method proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ) and developed by @xcite ( @xcite ) consists in minimizing a joint measure for the normalized lorentz force and the divergence of the field , given by the function , @xmath33d^{3}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a weighting function related position .",
    "it is clear that ( for @xmath35 ) the force - free equations are fulfilled when @xmath36 is equal to zero .",
    "this method involves minimizing @xmath36 by optimizing the solution function @xmath37 through states that are increasingly force- and divergence - free , where @xmath38 is an artificial time - like parameter introduced .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) have presented a class of axis - symmetric nlff fields in the spherical coordinate system .",
    "these nlff field can be used to test the performance of field extrapolation by shifted under two steps of cartesian coordinate system transformation , rotating by an angle @xmath39 around the y - axis and moving the origin to a distance @xmath40 along the z - axis .",
    "a special class of nlff fields denoted @xmath9(@xmath41 , @xmath42 ) can be obtained in the spherical coordinate system . for different @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it can give different distributions of magnetic field , which meet the requirements of divergence - free and force - free equations .",
    "then we should specify two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 for coordinate transformation . in this paper",
    "we choose such two classic nlff fields as semi - analytical fields :    saf1 : the semi - analytical field with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , set @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] in the cartesian coordinate system .",

    "the mesh is 64 @xmath51 64 @xmath51 64 for those two fields .",
    "because @xmath0 will be studied mainly , the values of analytical @xmath0 ( @xmath52 ) of saf1 and saf2 are calculated ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ) and saved in 3d position .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the field lines of saf1 , avi , bie and opt .",
    "it can be found that the distributions of field lines of extrapolated fields ( avi , bie or opt . field ) are basically consistent with that of saf1 , and the field lines of avi and bie fields are very similar .",
    "hence the structure of spatial field obtained from field extrapolation can present for that of semi - analytical field at some extent . in order to evaluate the performance of extrapolated field , we calculate the average ( @xmath53 ) and maximum ( @xmath54 ) lorentz - force ( @xmath55  @xmath51  @xmath56 , @xmath57 is permeability ) and @xmath58 , defined by equation ( [ sigma_j ] ) same as @xcite ( @xcite ) , to test the extent of force - free for each extrapolated field .",
    "the results of these physical quantity are given in table  1 for saf1 and the corresponding extrapolated fields , here the pixel size is assumed 1 arcsec .",
    "it can be found that angles between @xmath55  and  @xmath9 of opt .",
    "field ( comparable to saf1 at some extent ) are smaller than those of avi and bie fields .",
    "@xmath59    .the results of the average ( @xmath53 ) and maximum ( @xmath54 ) lorentz - force and @xmath58 for saf1 and the corresponding extrapolated fields .",
    "[ tabsaf1ff ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig5](b ) shows rsd of @xmath52 for saf2 , where @xmath60 is 0.0023 and the points is also very concentrated , which also indicate that deviation of @xmath52 of saf2 is negligible .",
    "it means that saf2 also satisfies force - free equations very well .",
    "same as figure  [ fig6 ] , pdf of rsd of @xmath0 along some selected field lines are plotted in figure  [ fig12 ] for saf2 , bie , avi and opt .",
    "fields . from this figure",
    ", it can be found that calculation errors denoted by rsd , that deduced from saf2 , is smaller than those of saf1 .",
    "@xmath60 is 0.13 - 0.11 , 0.80 - 1.02 , 0.67 - 1.34 and 0.33 - 0.55 for saf2 , avi , bie and opt .",
    "fields , respectively , which are better than those of saf1 .",
    "however the pdfs of rsd are also very wide for these extrapolated nlff fields .",
    "rsd vs field line length for saf2 , avi , bie and opt .",
    "fields are plotted in figure  [ fig13 ] , it can give the same results consistent with those of saf1 , that rsd do not depend on field line length either .",
    "in this paper , force - free factor @xmath0 of nlff field was mainly studied .",
    "the aim is to find , to what extent , @xmath0 along a given field line can keep a constant , and to give an error estimation on @xmath0 calculated from magnetic field .    through analysis",
    ", it is found that there are unavoidable calculation errors for deducing @xmath0 from magnetic field , the calculation errors are most likely to locate near where magnetic field components are reversed .",
    "@xmath60 of @xmath0 along selected field lines is about 0.1 @xmath2 0.2 for semi - analytical fields , which can be considered as calculation errors of latexmath:[$\\langle     it is found that there are obvious deviations on @xmath0 of extrapolated fields from that of semi - analytical fields .",
    "the results of deviation of @xmath0 along selected field lines are as follows : for saf1 , @xmath60 of @xmath0 along selected field lines are about 0.96 - 1.19 , 0.63 - 1.07 and 0.43 - 0.72 , for avi , bie and opt",
    ". fields , respectively .",
    "while for saf2 , they are about 0.13 - 0.11 , 0.80 - 1.02 , 0.67 - 1.34 and 0.33 - 0.55 for avi , bie and opt . fields , respectively . in both cases , it can be found that rsd of @xmath0 along the selected field lines do not depend on field line length .",
    "since rsd is a criterion for the deviation from a perfect force - free state ( the lower values indicate a more accurate force - free state ) and rsd of opt . field is less than those of avi and bie fields basically , so the performance of opt .",
    "extrapolated fields is superior to other two extrapolated fields at some extent . in addition",
    ", an interesting thing is that @xmath62 is valid for all case of opt .",
    "field , which is the same as semi - analytical fields .",
    "previous studies mostly paid close attentions to the global or point to point properties for extrapolated fiedl , even if these properties are reasonable and acceptable , another property of force - free field ( @xmath0   should be an constant along field line ) may not be satisfied well .",
    "for example , bie method have given an constrain on the angles between @xmath9  ( calculated from helmholtz equation ) and  @xmath55  ( deduced from @xmath9 ) at each point , so the reasonability of global performance may be improved on the whole , but higher requirements ( @xmath0   should be an constant along field line ) should be add for extrapolation method . for the extrapolation errors of avi method ,",
    "there are two main effects , first is that it reconstructs the field by two field terms ; second is that the singularity problems can not removal completely .",
    "in fact , the initial condition of potential field for opt . field may give better results of rsd at some extent , however the superiority of opt .",
    "field can also be studied from other aspects , such as the correlation coefficients of @xmath0 between extrapolated field and semi - analytical field and other global properties .",
