    "highly excited strings ( he s ) are responsible for numerous miraculous properties of string perturbation theory , they play a central role in ensuring the absence of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences and are a crucial ingredient in regarding string theory as a theory of quantum gravity . a fundamental driving force underlying much of the recent flourish of interest @xcite is that a detailed and careful study of he s ( in addition possibly to branes and other solitons in string theory ) will likely reveal previously unforeseen features of quantum gravity . for example , in reference to quantum black holes ( bh ) , both in terms of microstates out of which the black hole interior is constructed @xcite ( usually with some additional ingredients ) , and in terms of ( possibly non - local ) structure at the black hole horizon due to string effects@xcite , building on earlier ideas @xcite , with possible implications for the black hole information paradox . see @xcite for a recent review of various traditional ideas in this direction .",
    "contrary to field theoretic intuition , it has also recently been shown @xcite that in semi - realistic heterotic string compactifications with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and exponentially small values for the cosmological constant , the global structure ( or `` shape '' ) of the effective potential ( around certain self - dual points in moduli space , corresponding to extrema of the effective potential ) is strongly influenced by contributions from massive string modes ( as well as non - level matched string states ) , thus further highlighting the importance of the he s contributions even in low energy effective field theories .    on a parallel note",
    ", highly excited strings may have also been produced in the early universe @xcite , possibly during one or more symmetry - breaking phase transitions @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) , providing an observational signature for superstrings @xcite . in this context",
    "he s are referred to as _ cosmic superstrings _ , and if produced they can have a wide variety of signatures , most notably _ gravitational wave signatures _",
    "@xcite , including gravitational wave bursts produced from cusps and kinks @xcite , covering a wide frequency range that can be probed by pulsar timing arrays , ground - based interferometers ( such as ligo ) and the much anticipated elisa @xcite , to mention a handful .",
    "in addition , even though the planck satellite has placed strong constraints from the temperature data of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the cmb still offers observational prospects via polarisation and non - gaussianity @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein for a more complete list of observational signals .",
    "one major uncertainty @xcite is the eventual destination of the energy of a string network , gravitational and possibly massive radiation ( and the associated backreaction ) which is believed to play a major role in determining the average size of the produced string loops .",
    "furthermore , incorporating backreaction in theoretical predictions for gravitational wave bursts from individual loops is still an unresolved issue that is suspected may play a major role in their observational prospects .",
    "partly motivated by the above developments , let us now zoom in further on he s in the context of string perturbation theory in particular . from this viewpoint",
    ", the first step will be to set - up an efficient construction that will directly yield string amplitudes in the presence of he s vertex operators , a complete set of which ( in a coherent state basis ) was first constructed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we used these vertex operators to compute decay rates and power associated to massless radiation , while also making contact with low energy effective theory ( in a certain ir limit ) .",
    "the tools we have constructed are powerful enough to capture a wide range of phenomena , including , e.g. , radiative backreaction corrections to the classical gravitational wave results @xcite , cross sections and decay rates associated to he s , including loop corrections , etc .",
    "the current document is the first of a series of technical papers on string amplitudes with he s @xcite .",
    "a fundamental tool that we make use of is the chiral splitting theorem of dhoker and phong @xcite , whereby string amplitudes at fixed - loop momenta chirally factorise .",
    "we will make use of and generalise this framework in a number of ways , but to motivate further our approach in this document let us begin with some introductory technical comments .    in a series of recent papers",
    "@xcite sen and collaborators have revisited various aspects of superstring theory ( unitarity of string amplitudes , mass and wavefunction renormalisation @xcite , perturbation theory around dynamically shifted string vacua @xcite , offshell string amplitudes @xcite , wick rotations and analytic continuations @xcite , one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) quantum effective actions , etc . ) . in a very careful and complete study @xcite pius and sen derived cutkosky rules for superstring field theory amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory by providing a prescription for taking integration contours of loop energies in the complex plane ( which would naively otherwise yield divergent results for the corresponding s - matrix elements ) . in @xcite",
    "sen then showed that this prescription of introducing loop momenta and appropriately deforming the integration contours is equivalent to that of berera @xcite and witten @xcite , ( see also @xcite and in particular @xcite for related discussions on analyticity of string amplitudes ) , in the worldsheet approach to superstring theory to all orders in perturbation theory . in the approach of witten @xcite one is to deform the integration cycles over moduli space of punctured riemann surfaces into a complexified moduli space , and this establishes consistency of the former fixed - loop momenta approach with s - matrix unitarity .",
    "sen then recently also discussed @xcite an application of the fixed - loop momenta approach , building on earlier work @xcite and in particular @xcite , namely mass renormalisation of unstable massive string states ( where a naive computation yields divergent results for the two - point one - loop amplitude ) , explaining how to obtain finite results that are consistent with unitarity .",
    "the basic reason for the aforementioned divergences are ultimately due to the fact that the analogue of the ` @xmath3 ' prescription of quantum field theory is somewhat subtle in string theory @xcite because string amplitudes are most naturally defined in euclidean space where they are real @xcite .",
    "therefore , e.g. , potential imaginary parts ( that are required by unitarity ) in lorentzian signature string amplitudes show up as divergences in the corresponding euclidean space amplitudes . motivated by string field theory , sen @xcite and pius and sen @xcite",
    "have provided a well - defined prescription for dealing with such analytic continuations by reformulating string amplitudes in terms of _ fixed - loop momenta _ and deforming their integration cycles into the complex plane following a specific prescription ( whereby loop energy contours are pinned down at @xmath4 following a non - trivial but well - defined path in between , leading to lorentzian signature amplitudes ) .",
    "drawing from analogies with string field theory @xcite , the introduction of fixed - loop momenta is central to sen s analytic continuation approach to string amplitudes ( which are traditionally given as integrals over moduli space , in the `` schwinger parametrisation '' with implicitly integrated loop momenta ) .",
    "fixed - loop momenta amplitudes have a long history in string theory that dates back to the old dual models , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein , but it was not until dijkgraaf , e.  verlinde and h.  verlinde @xcite ( building on @xcite ) that fixed - loop momenta appeared in the path integral formulation of string theory , where various interesting properties were also noted , one such property being that ( taking into account also the belavin - knizhnik theorem @xcite ) bosonic amplitudes with tachyonic external vertex operators in simple toroidal compactifications _ chirally factorise_. this observation was later explored in a much more complete manner and in the full superstring context by dhoker and phong @xcite ( although even here the explicit results were derived for massless external states , and also non - compact flat spacetime ) .",
    "this study led to a _",
    "chiral splitting theorem _",
    ": when string amplitudes are written in terms of integrals over loop momenta - cycle loop momenta , with @xmath5 , with @xmath6 labelling the genus of the riemann surface and @xmath7 a canonical intersection basis for the homology cycles . ] and fermion zero modes ( when present ) , the corresponding integrands chirally factorise ( in terms of their supermoduli , abelian differentials , worldsheet coordinates of vertex operators , polarisation tensors and momenta ) .",
    "one thing we would like to highlight is that in the approach of dhoker and phong @xcite and sen @xcite , the fixed - loop momenta amplitudes are constructed by a `` reverse engineering '' method , whereby string amplitudes are computed using the conventional approach @xcite , and it is only at a later stage of the computation ( after integrating out the path integral fields and hence obtaining the `` schwinger form '' of amplitudes ) that it is noted that explicit string amplitudes under consideration can be written as integrals over loop momenta .",
    "unfortunately , such an approach is almost hopeless when considering amplitudes with arbitrarily massive he s vertex operators , because the fixed - loop momenta amplitudes will typically have quite a complicated form that one is to somehow guess , hence the name ` reverse engineering ' mentioned above .",
    "( a systematic approach to `` guessing '' the correct loop momentum integrand given the schwinger parametrisation was given by sen at one - string loop in @xcite , but this is somewhat tedious and messy and requires a case - by - case study . ) dhoker and phong @xcite made fundamental further progress by making the remarkable observation that the correct fixed - loop momenta result can be obtained directly from the path integral if the path integral fields of vertex operators , @xmath8 , are replaced by ( anti-)chiral fields @xmath9 ( and @xmath10 ) as appropriate for left- and right - moving degrees of freedom , while inserting exponential factors : . ]",
    "@xmath11 into the integrands , where @xmath12 are loop momenta spanning all ( non - compact in their derivation ) spacetime directions , the ( anti-)chiral _ effective _ fields , @xmath13 , being defined by standard wick contractions using ` chiral propagators ' : @xmath14 given that these effective rules were derived explicitly by making use of the ` reverse engineering ' method , it is important to show that the prescription for the effective rules does not depend on it . is the usual ( worldsheet moduli dependent ) prime form of fay @xcite ( that has a compact representation in terms of riemann theta functions , their derivatives and abelian differentials @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath15 , although multiple - valued @xcite , generalises the notion of distance , @xmath16 , on @xmath17 to arbitrary genus riemann surfaces , having the unique property that it vanishes only at @xmath18 as @xmath19 . ]    of course , one expects the chiral splitting theorem to also hold for generic vertex operators and in generic toroidally compactified string theories , but as the derivation of dhoker and phong @xcite was carried out explicitly in non - compact minkowski ( or euclidean ) spacetime ( and in @xcite in the context on @xmath20 orbifold compactifications ) and for massless vertex operator insertions it would be desirable to discuss amplitudes with generic vertex operators more explicitly . furthermore , it would be desirable to adopt an approach that does not rely on the reverse engineering method outlined above , and hence show in particular that the potential ambiguities discussed by sen @xcite are absent for generic vertex operators when using the effective chiral splitting rules of dhoker and phong .",
    "the ambiguity we are referring to is the following . in @xcite",
    "sen has shown that the same schwinger parameter representation of a given string amplitude ( which arises directly from the usual path integral formulation of string theory ) can be represented in _",
    "more than one way _ from a fixed - loop momenta representation , see the discussion associated to equation ( 2.17 ) in @xcite and also the footnote below ( 3.20 ) there , leading one to question whether this reverse engineering method that has been adopted to - date could potentially be ambiguous for generic vertex operators .",
    "sen then went on to argue that this ambiguity will actually not be visible in the result for the full amplitude _ after _ having integrated out the loop momenta using the prescription for avoiding singularities @xcite in the loop momenta integrations .",
    "although this is a very important step forward ( given in particular the subtleties of the loop momentum contour integrations in lorentzian - signature target spacetimes ) , there are situations where it is _ not _ desirable to integrate out the loop momenta completely , and identify the loop momentum _ integrand _ with a physical observable .",
    "this at first sight may seem unphysical , not least because the integrand of the loop momentum integrals are _ not _ modular invariant ( defining loop momenta requires specifying a homology basis @xcite , which transforms non - trivially under the mapping class group ) , but nevertheless there do exist physical observables that are sensitive to this integrand .",
    "put simply , strings in loops can go onshell and can therefore also appear in the detector of a given observer .",
    "their momenta can thus be measured , and so it does make sense to consider the integrands of loop momentum integrands of string amplitudes as being physical .",
    "one can also make this argument by appealing to the optical theorem and unitarity .",
    "a good example is the following .",
    "consider the power emitted from a massive string per unit solid angle .",
    "here we imagine a generic highly excited string that is unstable and emitting radiation while it decays , usually anisotropically , with massless radiation often being the dominant decay channel .",
    "we place a detector far from the interaction region and measure the power absorbed by the detector as a function of energy or frequency of the radiation , and so extract a spectrum which will contain information about the radiating string state ( allowing one _ in principle _ to reconstruct the quantum numbers of the decaying string ) .",
    "the orientation of the emitting string can also be determined in this manner , due to the anisotropy of the decay ; this is particularly relevant for gravitational wave emission from strings with cusps where the associated burst of radiation is highly anisotropic , and this ultimately provides one of the strongest signals in cosmic string phenomenology ; this has a long history , see @xcite for an effective theory computation and @xcite for a corresponding analytical string theory computation , the two being in precise agreement when backreaction is neglected and one is confined to low energies .",
    "the observable in this thought experiment can , e.g. , be extracted from the imaginary part of the two - point ( say one - loop at weak coupling ) amplitude at fixed - loop momenta , @xmath21 , with two vertex operator insertions ( related by euclidean conjugation , more about which will be discussed in a sequel @xcite ) . in particular , for @xmath22 non - compact dimensions , the power associated to decay products of momentum @xmath23 , centred around some arbitrary spatial direction @xmath24 , can be extracted from @xcite : integral is crucial and has been discussed very carefully and clearly for generic loop amplitudes in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath25 where it is seen that the loop momenta , @xmath23 , actually get identified with the momentum of the decay products , some of which end up in the detector , as alluded to above . here",
    "@xmath26 is the length @xcite and @xmath27 the corresponding mass of the emitting string whose vertex operator , @xmath28 , is normalised by the leading singularity in the ope:[page : oonorm ] , is related to the gravitational coupling , @xmath29 , via @xmath30 . in @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "note that @xmath33 . ]",
    "an ` overline ' represents taking the euclidean adjoint , see @xcite and in particular @xcite for a refined discussion of this notion ( in the presence of compact dimensions where there are some additional phases that are absent in @xcite ) , and we have decomposed the loop momentum integral as follows , @xmath35",
    ". extracting the imaginary part will give rise ( according to the cutkosky rules @xcite ) to two delta functions , one of which places the emitted radiation onshell , and the second delta function quantises the spectrum of decay products ( in the case of massless radiation ) , leading to integer - valued energies , @xmath36 , of the form : @xmath37 and @xmath38 is summed over ( subject to energy conservation ) , as expected , e.g. , for _ gravitational waves _ from strings .",
    "this procedure was first carried out by the present authors in @xcite , where a brief summary of our results can be found , as well as the effective low energy theory that reproduces them . clearly , if we want to extract information about the energy - dependence of the emitted radiation we do not want to perform the sum over @xmath38 .",
    "if we were to integrate out the loop momentum completely the @xmath39 dependence of the power would be lost .",
    "we compute observables in explicitly in follow - up articles @xcite , but the purpose of the discussion in this paragraph is to show that it is sometimes desirable to _ not _ integrate out the loop momenta completely , and that this is of interest even in calculations of physical observables . therefore , the resolution of the aforementioned ambiguity of sen @xcite is not totally satisfactory ( because it relies on the assumption that it is of interest to integrate out loop momenta completely ) .",
    "summarising , it would be desirable to adopt an approach that does not rely on the reverse engineering derivation of dhoker and phong @xcite and that of sen @xcite and show explicitly how to resolve this potential ambiguity observed by sen in his study of two - point amplitudes of massive strings .    in this article",
    "we resolve this particular ambiguity completely , for completely generic vertex operator insertions ( with arbitrary winding and kk charges ) , and for generic toroidally compactified backgrounds ( with generic constant khler and complex structure target space moduli , background kk gauge fields and torsion ) , and to any finite order in the string loop expansion .",
    "therefore , our derivation applies to all closed string amplitudes in target spacetimes @xmath40 .",
    "we focus on the bosonic string for simplicity ( or the bosonic sector of the superstring , the conclusions being independent of the chiral splitting statements given that up to fermion zero modes the fermionic contribution is already chirally factorised , as are the ghost contributions ) .",
    "specifically , our approach will be to drop the ` reverse engineering ' approach of dhoker and phong @xcite and sen @xcite altogether , and to rather construct the fixed - loop momentum representations directly and explicitly , starting from a generic worldsheet path integral , leaving no room for ambiguities .",
    "this will be achieved by inserting momentum - conserving delta functions into the worldsheet path integral that explicitly determine the loop momentum contribution associated to @xmath41-cycle strings in the loops , as shown in the second equality in ( [ eq : a(j ) ] ) below .",
    "these loop momenta constitute an independent set and their presence are also a fundamental ingredient in obtaining a handle on the energies and momenta that contribute to loop corrections , thus for example bridging the gap between wilson s approach to quantum field theory @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite , and an analogous approach in string theory ( although we will not explore this connection further here ) , and wilson s approach adapted to string field theory has recently been discussed by sen in @xcite . unless one wants to work directly with string field theory or in the old operator approach , instead of adopting the first - quantised covariant path integral formalism that we consider here , string amplitudes with fixed - loop momenta",
    "is the closest one can get to the corresponding field theory amplitudes without considering explicit pant decompositions and degenerations of the worldsheet .",
    "fixed - loop momenta amplitudes are , arguably , one of the most natural approaches to ( at least closed ) perturbative string amplitude computations .",
    "first and foremost , it is considerably easier to write down amplitudes at fixed - loop momenta than it is to adopt the traditional approach @xcite and write down the corresponding integrated loop momenta amplitudes directly  a fact that is certainly not widely appreciated in the literature .",
    "this is largely due to the chiral splitting theorem of dhoker and phong @xcite ; recall that correlation functions for the worldsheet fields are carried out using the _ chiral _ propagators exhibited above ( analogous relations for the fermionic sector or in terms of superfields can be found in @xcite ) , where also zero mode subtractions are absent ( it is useful to compare with the non - chiral genus-@xmath6 propagator ( [ eq : green function+regular*m ] ) ) .",
    "secondly , it is ( apparently @xcite ) considerably easier ( from a technical point of view ) to analytically compute explicit amplitudes in the chiral fixed - loop momenta formalism than it is to extract the corresponding integrated loop momenta expressions , as we briefly summarised in @xcite .",
    "the physical reason is that in the integrated loop momenta approach one is automatically resumming all momentum contributions inside loops ( so that it is difficult to take a low energy limit as loop energies are already integrated out ) , and as a result one ends up having to resort to saddle - point approximations or numerical methods in order to extract some physics or even order of magnitude estimates @xcite , whereas in the fixed - loop momenta approach ( _ after _ adopting a coherent vertex operator basis for external states @xcite , see in particular @xcite for a recent analysis ) , things tend to resum into , e.g. , bessel functions , exponentials and related special functions @xcite . as the latter have been studied by mathematicians for centuries , with various of their properties examined in detail ( such as asymptotic expansions , series and integral representations , etc . )",
    ", this provides a useful and novel working handle on generic string amplitudes .",
    "amplitudes with he s should be expected to reproduce various classical or effective field theory results in certain limits ( with non - local stringy sources ) , and adopting the correct toolset is absolutely fundamental to exposing this simple structure , while also providing an explicit approach to computing various stringy and quantum corrections which may or may not be large compared to the effective description  the effective approach and its link to string amplitudes with he s vertex operators will be presented in @xcite , where again the basic connection to the effective theory was presented in @xcite , building on an earlier conjecture by dabholkar , gibbons , harvey and ruiz @xcite , see also @xcite for a very insightful complementary decription .",
    "the emphasis on the _ naturalness _ of adopting a coherent vertex operator basis in particular when discussing amplitudes with he s will be explained in sequels in much greater detail @xcite .",
    "the present contribution will not rely on any particular vertex operator basis , and also ( with a bit a care and tweaking @xcite , see also @xcite ) will apply to offshell as well as onshell string amplitudes .",
    "let us also re - emphasise that our initial focus will be on bosonic string theory in this series of papers , because as string amplitudes with coherent vertex operators is a novel and unexplored area of research it will be easiest to first focus on the bosonic string and understand that case well before moving on to the much more interesting but also more involved superstring framework .",
    "the bosonic string already contains most of the non - trivial features associated to he s and will provide the basic physics , with the additional complications associated to @xcite supermoduli space , gauge fixing , picture changing , etc .",
    ", of the superstring providing a sharpening of the bosonic string results ( by eliminating a tachyon , introducing supersymmetry to stabilise the vacuum and eliminate massless tadpoles , etc . ) , but it will not change much of the essential physics picture .    finally , for the more philosophically - minded readers , we will also discuss how wave / particle duality ( or rather _ wave / string duality _ ) manifests itself in string theory . we will discuss a simple example ( the standard one - loop vacuum amplitude ) and then generalise the argument to all string amplitudes at any string loop order .",
    "the resulting picture is rather simple , but we are not aware of it having been discussed before in the literature .",
    "the result is that fixed - loop momenta amplitudes can be thought of as corresponding to a _ wave picture _ , whereas the corresponding integrated - loop momenta amplitudes provide the corresponding _",
    "string picture_. there are four natural representations for string amplitudes in toroidally compactified spacetimes , corresponding to the fact that loop momenta in the compact or non - compact dimensions can be either integrated or fixed , so there are four possibilities . the intuitive statement , as we shall explain , is roughly that summing over all trajectories of a loop of string in ( say ) a compact target space , including the number of times a closed string can traverse the compact space is equivalent to summing over all frequencies of a standing wave in a `` box '' , thus making wave / string duality manifest .",
    "this therefore provides a physical interpretation of the standard poisson resummation in string partition functions ( for the compact dimensions ) , and there is an analogous statement in the non - compact dimensions .    in * sec .",
    "[ sec : o ] * we provide a brief overview of our results ( skipping almost all of the subtle and technical points ) . in * sec .",
    "[ sec : sagf ] * we derive the generating function for generic string amplitudes in generic toroidal compactifications associated to arbitrary vertex operator insertions and at arbitrary string loop order ; this is where the majority of the work lies .",
    "the result here is extremely simple . in * sec .",
    "[ sec : wsd ] * we discuss the string theory manifestation of wave / particle duality of quantum mechanics , which is closely related to the presence or absence of fixed - loop momenta ( in both compact and non - compact target spacetime dimensions ) .",
    "[ sec : cf ] * is a corollary of the preceding sections and completes the derivation of the dhoker and phong chiral splitting theorem for generic he s vertex operator insertions ( including kk and winding charges and general polarisation tensors and oscillators spanning all spacetime dimensions ) and generic constant target space khler and complex structure moduli , kk gauge fields , as well as spacetime torsion .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of the main results of the current document . the main objective underlying",
    "this series of papers is to provide a working handle on string amplitudes with he s vertex operator insertions .",
    "the first step in this direction , which is presented here , is thus to construct a _ generating function _ , @xmath42 , for generic string amplitudes in generic toroidal compactifications : @xmath43 where @xmath22 denotes the number of non - compact dimensions ( e.g. ,  @xmath31 ) and @xmath44 the critical number of dimensions ( e.g. ,  @xmath45 or 10 , in the bosonic string or superstring respectively ) .",

    "the chiral correlator in ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) reads explicitly : @xmath692 where the argument in the exponential equals @xmath100 , and similarly for the anti - chiral half , @xmath693 as mentioned above , in the derivation of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) we assumed @xmath684 , but in fact using the ( anti-)chiral representation of amplitudes enables one to consider more general insertions for which asymptotic vertex operators can have non - trivial winding . that is , using the chirally split generating function it is almost obvious how to insert vertex operators of the form : @xmath694 with @xmath695 , simply by taking @xmath696 on the _ right - hand side _ of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) to be independent of @xmath697 .",
    "the corresponding insertion on the _ left - hand _ side of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) however is not so obvious , given that here vertex operators associated to ( [ eq : ffbareikx+ _ ] ) should be functionals of the full path integral field , @xmath698 . when @xmath699 , it is clear that to every vertex operator insertion ( [ eq : ffbareikx+ _ ] ) on the right - hand side is associated a vertex operator insertion , @xmath700 on the left - hand side with total momentum @xmath701 . in order to extend insertions on the left - hand side to vertex operators with non - trivial winding where @xmath695 we need to integrate over all @xmath698 with source @xmath66 , and constrain the integration to fields with non - trivial winding",
    "this may be achieved @xcite by a @xmath696- , @xmath697-dependent shift in the classical instanton solutions @xmath702 of ( [ eq : xcl sol ] ) .",
    "therefore , with this shift vertex operators of the form ( [ eq : ffbareikx ] ) remain valid insertions even in the presence of non - trivial winding .",
    "we will not work out the details of this procedure here as there exists a simpler approach .",
    "in particular , we will instead enforce chiral splitting of the source , the prescription being the following .",
    "suppose we consider an amplitude with @xmath38 vertex operator insertions , each of which ( in the chiral representation ( [ eq : ffbareikx+ _ ] ) ) carries an exponential of the form : @xmath703 , with @xmath704 , in addition to some polynomial of derivatives of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "( more generally , every vertex operator will be a superposition of such momentum eigenstates , as is the case for coherent vertex operators for instance . )",
    "the statement is that insertions with exponentials of the form : @xmath705 on the _ right - hand side _ of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) ( with @xmath706 generically ) correspond to evaluating the source on the _ left - hand side _ of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) at : @xmath707 so that with this choice of source there exists the correspondence : @xmath708 _ even though _ on the left - hand side the embedding field , @xmath119 , contains ( potentially ) also instanton or soliton contributions whereas the right - hand side does not .",
    "so the prescription is to consider @xmath66 on the left - hand side as an operator and act with the derivatives , @xmath709 , of ( [ eq : j split ] ) before carrying out the line integrals . using the representation for the source ( [ eq : j split ] )",
    "makes is obvious that we can simply substitute ( [ eq : j split ] ) into the right - hand side of the @xmath684 expression ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) , and then the operator nature of the decomposition ( [ eq : j split ] ) will ensure that only @xmath696 appears in chiral terms and @xmath697 in anti - chiral terms , and so we can legitimately extend the result ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) to the case where @xmath710 .",
    "this is the desired result .",
    "having understood how to insert vertex operators with non - trivial winding using either the chiral fixed - loop momenta or the non - chiral integrated - loop momenta representation , a crucial remark is that making use of ` _ chiral vertex operators _ ' ( [ eq : ffbareikx+ _ ] ) that are constructed out of @xmath13 and correspondingly the chiral fixed - loop momenta representation of amplitudes ( i.e.  working in terms of the right - hand side of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) ) vastly simplifies computations while preserving complete generality .    that the fixed - loop momenta generating function chirally factorises in the critical dimension is in line with the belavin - knizhnik theorem @xcite combined with the chiral splitting theorem @xcite , although the existing proof of chiral splitting had been established _",
    "explicitly _ only for generic genus-@xmath6 massless and exponential external physical vertex operators . here we have extended this result to _ all _ correlation functions of operators inserted on generic compact riemann surfaces .",

    "it is worth re - emphasising that ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) is truly a remarkable statement , and it is due to this relation that it is justified to use vertex operators that are constructed out of the chiral fields @xmath195 , @xmath196 ( and also @xmath712 , @xmath713 and @xmath714 ) . to compute any string amplitude , for the matter sector",
    "we can use either vertex operators constructed out of the full path integral fields , @xmath119 , or the ( anti-)chiral fields , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and this choice depends on whether we want to extract correlation functions using the left - hand side of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) or the right - hand side respectively .",
    "however , the natural representation for vertex operators that arises from the operator - state correspondence is in terms of the ( anti-)chiral fields .",
    "notice that we have _ not _ appealed to any onshell condition in order to split the field in the path integral @xmath119 into chiral and anti - chiral pieces , @xmath195 , @xmath196 . the best way to think of the latter is as fields that arise",

    "another point to emphasise is that when vertex operators have winding charges , kk charges and/or polarisations in compact directions we need _ not _ expand the fields @xmath195 , @xmath196 that vertex operators are constructed out of around zero mode or classical instanton contributions , and in addition the simple correlators , @xmath715 are exact in the limit @xmath716 and should be used to carry out the operator product expansions that map states to vertex operators  this will be discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "this appears to be somewhat miraculous , but it is nevertheless true ( for arbitrary - genus string amplitudes ) .",
    "these observations are of course direct generalisations of the classic result of dhoker and phong @xcite , the differences being that here :    * we consider generic correlation functions ( rather than massless asymptotic states ) associated to arbitrarily excited string vertex operators ( potentially with winding and kk charges and general polarisation tensors and oscillators ) ; * we explicitly keep a generic constant background , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( rather than @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , so that these results hold true for generic constant target space khler and complex structure moduli , torsion and background gauge fields ; * we consider generic target spaces @xmath40 ( rather than @xmath89 ) , implying that there are also instanton contributions ( worldsheets that wrap @xmath81 ) that are absent in @xmath626 and that were hence not made manifest in @xcite .",

    "finally , generically there will be additional delta - function ( or kronecker - delta ) constraints ( implicit in @xmath724 ) in addition to that appearing explicitly in ( [ eq : sfim ] ) , associated to the fact that the full invariant amplitude also contains disconnected pieces , i.e.  if @xmath763 , depending on context , as exhibited in ( [ eq : s = scsc .. ] ) .",
    "we have constructed a generating function ( and associated correlation functions ) for string amplitudes in generic constant string backgrounds , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , on @xmath40 , so that also _ all _ khler and complex structure moduli ( of the target space torus , @xmath81 ) contained in @xmath773 , background kk gauge fields , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , spacetime torsion , @xmath51 and also spacetime metric , @xmath774 , are allowed to be turned on . in the process , we have derived the chiral splitting theorem of dhoker and phong @xcite for string amplitudes , which we have generalised to the aforementioned background and with arbitrarily excited string vertex operator insertions ( with generic kk and winding charges , as well as polarisation tensors associated to generic oscillators and spacetime indices ) .",
    "our approach differs from that of dhoker and phong @xcite ( and also sen @xcite ) , in that we did not make use of the `` reverse engineering '' approach ( where the target spacetime embedding fields , @xmath698 , are first integrated out and only at a later stage of the computation is it noted that the result can be written as an integral whose integration variables get interpreted as @xmath41-cycle loop momenta ) .",
    "as pointed out in a recent paper by sen @xcite , such a reverse engineering approach could potentially lead to ambiguities ( because the same integrated - loop momenta amplitude can be written in more than one way as an integral over loop momenta @xcite ) .",
    "sen went on to explain that these ambiguities will not be visible in the final amplitudes after integrating out the loop momenta ( while adopting an appropriate analytic continuation for the loop momentum integral contours @xcite ) , and that these ambiguities are therefore immaterial .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction above , it is sometimes desirable to not integrate out the loop momenta , and that this is also of interest for the computation of some physical observables , such as the spectrum of massless radiation associated to a decaying string . therefore , the reverse engineering method could potentially lead to ambiguous results for observables . in our approach",
    "we have resolved this potential ambiguity , in that we introduced loop momenta associated to @xmath41-cycle strings from the outset ( by explicit momentum conserving delta function insertions into the original path integral where there is no room for this ambiguity ) , and have thus shown that the result of dhoker and phong ( that one can replace the target space fields , @xmath698 , by a set of effective chiral fields , @xmath775 , @xmath10 for the left- and right - moving degrees of freedom , appropriately modified so as to apply to generic backgrounds , @xmath40 , and vertex operators ) is fully justified and leads to the correct un - ambiguous result for the fixed - loop momentum amplitudes .",
    "let us now zoom in on the statement ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) .",
    "here it is crucial to note that the left - hand side denotes the usual path integral over matter , @xmath698 , and ghost fields , @xmath62 , whereas on the right - hand side the matter and ghost fields have been integrated out , and the result has been written in terms of wick contractions of effective ( anti-)chiral fields , @xmath775 , ( @xmath196 ) , whose correlation functions are determined from the chiral propagators ( [ eq : chiral < xx > ] ) , with the results given in ( [ eq:<>_+ ] ) and ( [ eq:<>_- ] ) .",
    "what we want to emphasise here is that on the left - hand side of ( [ < < v1 ... vn>>fixedloop4chirallysplit ] ) the target space embedding field appearing in vertex operators and the worldsheet action contains ( generically ) zero modes , instanton ( or soliton ) contributions , as well as quantum fluctuations , whereas the chiral fields on the right hand side are defined by their correlation functions , so that @xmath96 do _ not _ contain information about zero modes or instanton contributions .",
    "the latter have nevertheless been fully taken into account and appear in the overall delta function and loop momenta respectively . therefore , using the chiral representation of amplitudes significantly simplifies amplitude computations .",
    "finally , we have also discussed how wave / particle ( or rather wave / string ) duality is manifested in string theory , and we have shown that the fixed - loop momenta representation can be thought of as the ` wave picture ' , the integrated loop momenta expression yielding the ` string picture ' .",
    "there are also hybrid formulations ( or routhians ) whereby the compact and non - compact dimensions are in the wave or string picture , leading to four natural possibilities in total . in a forthcoming article @xcite we will show that adopting a wave picture leads to significant simplifications and explicit analytic results ( a string picture being much less tractable analytically ) .",
    "the objective here has been to provide a working and efficient handle on computing string amplitudes involving he s vertex operators . in @xcite",
    "we construct chiral he s coherent vertex operators ( which is a very natural basis for excited strings ) and discuss the notion of euclidean adjoint vertex operators ( which refines the rule of thumb of polchinski @xcite , a refinement that is necessary in order for _ all _ vertex operators to have positive norm ' is not sufficient when vertex operators have winding @xmath776 , in that there are some additional phases ( here @xmath777 are level numbers ) . ] ) .",
    "these vertex operators are then @xcite used to derive a generic expression for two - point amplitudes ( where we keep the genus of the worldsheet generic in order to study generic properties ) , whose imaginary part at one loop @xcite yields decay rates and power emitted into massless and massive radiation ( including radiative backreaction and in particular @xmath129 corrections ) , the real part giving mass shifts ( relevant for black hole physics @xcite ) . in @xcite we discuss decay rates associated to gravitational radiation in particular and in @xcite we make the connection to low energy effective field theory .",
