    "highly unusual properties of monolayers of graphite ( graphene ) and of optical media with negative refractive indices ( left - handed metamaterials ) had been independently predicted and studied theoretically a long time ago @xcite . at that time , however , these predictions were perceived as rather intriguing but unrealistic exotica , and remained unnoticed for about a half - century , until quite recently ( and nearly simultaneously ) they were embodied in real materials .",
    "this immediately triggered an explosion of interest and activities , in metamaterials and graphene , both in solid state physics and optics .",
    "researchers also realized that the most unusual properties of electron transport in graphene were also peculiar to the propagation of light in dielectric systems with metamaterials .",
    "mathematically , this is because , under some ( rather general ) conditions , the maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves in an inhomogeneous dielectric medium can be reduced to the dirac equations for charge carriers in graphene subjected to an external electric potential .",
    "the history of recasting maxwell equations in alternative , more compact , spinor forms goes back to the beginning of the past century , and is still in progress ( for a comprehensive historical overview see refs .",
    ", with recent examples in refs .  ) .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the similarity between maxwell and dirac equations has long been noticed ( according to ref .",
    ", majorana discussed it already in 1930 ) . in the general case of inhomogeneous media , the close analogy between ( i ) the quantum - mechanical form of the equations for the reimann - silberstain vector fields ( linear combinations of the electromagnetic vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and ( ii ) the dirac equation , written in the chiral representation of the dirac matrices , was explicitly demonstrated in ref .     recently , as graphene became increasingly more popular in solid state physics , the mathematically established similarity of maxwell and dirac equations took on a new physical significance .",
    "inspired by the very unusual predictions and discoveries made in graphene , research groups in optics started endeavors to reproduce the unique transport properties of graphene in specifically designed dielectric structures .",
    "an additional incentive to these efforts came from the fact that , while the elementary building blocks of graphene are fixed , modern micro- and nanotechnologies enable manufacturing periodic dielectric samples with a variety of types and sizes of unit cells",
    ". moreover , the electrodynamic parameters of photonic crystals can , in principle , be controlled by external fields , providing unique opportunities to study condensed matter phenomena in optical ways ; for example , by opening a gap between dirac cones , as well as breaking and restoring space - inversion and time - reversal symmetries @xcite .",
    "rather simple electrodynamical analogies furnish physical insights into properties and applications of graphene such as : the klein phenomenon @xcite , breaking the valley degeneracy @xcite , graphene quantum dots darancet , rozhkov , the electronic goos - hanchen shift @xcite , delocalization in one - dimensional disordered systems @xcite , etc .",
    "furthermore , some exotic phenomena predicted and discovered in optical systems ( like , for example , the `` light wheel '' localized mode @xcite , or confined cavity modes and mini - stop bands in broad periodic photonic waveguides @xcite ) could prompt unique possibilities for creating new graphene - based devices . in this regard ,",
    "particularly promising is the analogy between photonic crystal broad waveguides and zigzag graphene nanoribbons studied in ref .  , where it was shown that the photonic mode coupling also arises in nanoribbons at low energies",
    ". the implementation of the analogy between dirac electrons and light could be rewarding for the optical community as well , because it is relatively easy to create in graphene an inhomogeneous potential pattern with any distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 junctions , while designing a periodic or random stack of alternating positive - negative dielectric layers is nowadays a feasible task .",
    "thus , graphene could provide analogue laboratory models in order to test the optics of metamaterials in a controlled way .",
    "the key feature of graphene , from which all its unique transport properties stem , is the existence of dirac cones in the band structure of its energy spectrum . at first glance",
    ", one does not have to work hard to obtain in optics a double - conical , graphene - like dispersion law : it is inherent in any plane monochromatic wave propagating in a homogeneous medium , as the relation between its frequency @xmath4 and the wave number @xmath5 is given by @xmath6    however , the contact of two cones in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] only looks like a dirac point ( dp ) .",
    "in fact , of the two cones in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , only one ( for example , the upper one ) is related to a photon , while the second solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ( lower cone in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is redundant .",
    "this lower cone does not carry any additional information and is not related to any different physical entity like , for example , a hole in graphene or a positron in the case of relativistic qed . in other words ,",
    "the photon and antiphoton are identical @xcite .",
    "hence , the challenge in optics is to create a structure with a real dp in its spectrum , so that different types of waves would correspond to two different cones ( a sort of optical `` particle - antiparticle '' pair ) .",
    "appropriate for this purpose are photonic crystals , in which two modes degenerated in a homogeneous space become split by the periodicity @xcite .",
    "the analytical and numerical studies of two - dimensional periodic structures ( infinite rods embedded in a background medium with a different dielectric constant ) were carried out as early as in 1991 , for square @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices .",
    "linear singularities ( that nowadays are called dirac points ) are clearly seen in the band structures of both systems , although they escaped the attention of refs .",
    "mostly interested in absolute band gaps for different polarizations .",
    "afterwards , during more than two decades , studies of two - dimensional photonic crystals were primarily aimed on maximizing the photonic band gap @xcite ( see also the review ref .   and references therein ) , until the discovery of the unusual transport properties in graphene , and the potential to reproduce them in optics switched efforts towards the search and further exploration of photonic structures with dirac - cone - like singularities in their transmission spectra @xcite .",
    "a number of new optical phenomena arising due to the existence of dirac points were predicted and discovered : diffusion - like @xmath7-dependence of the pulse intensity on the distance @xmath8 of propagation inside the photonic crystal @xcite ( which is unusual for non - random media ) ; oscillatory motion of a gaussian beam ( optical analogue of the zitterbewegung effect ) 20,21,22 ; extinction of coherent backscattering @xcite ; conical diffraction @xcite ; as well as the existence of graphene - like and novel edge states @xcite .    from the above - mentioned publications",
    "one can conclude that the existence of dirac points in _ two - dimensional _ periodic structures is a rather universal phenomenon , in the sense that they appear irrespective of sample details , such as the shape and dielectric parameters of the `` atoms '' and its structural symmetry .",
    "for example , in the band structures presented in refs .  ,",
    "dps show up at square , triangular , and honeycomb lattices .",
    "the general criteria for the existence of dp in periodic dielectric samples were discussed in ref .  .",
    "the situation in layered periodic media is quite different and less studied .",
    "as we show below , dps can not exist in periodically - layered dielectric structures built of mono - type ( i.e. , with either all positive or negative refractive indices ) dielectrics , no matter their period , size , and dielectric contrast between the layers . in refs .",
    ", a one - dimensional periodic array of metallic unit cells of a special shape was considered , which exhibited dirac points created by the accidental degeneracy of two modes . to create photonic dirac cones in one dimension ,",
    "both normal and metamaterials should be used .",
    "interestingly enough , a single dp can exist in a _ homogeneous _ dispersive meta - medium at a frequency at which both the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability approach zero simultaneously @xcite .",
    "eigenwaves in _ structured _ , infinite periodic systems built of alternating normal and left - handed dielectric layers , and the transmission and reflection from finite samples , were analyzed in refs .  .",
    "it was shown that , when the spatial average of the refractive index over the period was zero , the band structure consisted of gaps at all frequencies except for a set of isolated points ( discrete modes ) , for which the optical thicknesses of the adjacent layers were equal to the same integer number of half - wavelengths .",
    "new dirac cones in graphene supelatices created by double - periodic and quasiperiodic electrostatic potentials have been considered in ref .  .",
    "here we study the transport properties of layered periodic dielectric systems `` electronically similar '' to graphene , in the sense that they possess dirac cones in their photonic band gap structures . in sec .",
    "ii , we demonstrate , using a simple example , and discuss the similarity and differences between the maxwell and dirac equations as well as between the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "section iii presents the transmission through potential barriers created in graphene by applying steplike electrostatic potentials , in comparison with light propagation in slabs of normal dielectrics and metamaterials . in sec .",
    "iv , the photonic band - gap structures of periodically layered dielectrics are compared with the structure of the electron energy zones of graphene subjected to a periodic potential .",
    "it is shown that , unlike a two - dimensional photonic crystal , dirac cones in a layered periodic medium can exist only when the medium consists of alternating slabs of left- and right - handed dielectrics ( mixed samples ) . in sec .",
    "v , we study the propagation of gaussian beams of light through periodically - layered _ mixed _",
    "samples built of alternating slabs with positive and negative refractive indices , and of beams of charge carriers through finite graphene superlattices .",
    "we demonstrate the anomalous , diffusion - like dependence of the intensity on the propagation distance , and an analog of the zitterbewegung effect in a wide range of parameters .",
    "new unusual transport properties of such samples are predicted .",
    "in particular , it is shown that two contacting dirac cones manifest themselves differently : given two beams with frequencies belonging to different cones , one is focused and another is defocused .",
    "the magnitude of the shift of the focus is independent on the distance of the sample from the focal plane of the incident beam and is proportional to the width of the sample . at oblique incidence , a gaussian beam is not displaced along the sample even at non - zero values of the mean value of the dielectric constant .",
    "the dynamics of the charge carriers in an external potential @xmath9 in graphene is described by a spinor @xmath10 whose components are related to two sublattices in the unit cell of the crystal @xcite . in the low - energy limit , near the dirac point",
    ", the components of this spinor obey the dirac equations .",
    "when the energy @xmath11 of the charge carrier is fixed , then the time dependence of the spinor is given by @xmath12 , and these equations can be written as @xmath13where @xmath14 is the electrostatic potential , and @xmath15 is the fermi velocity .    in order to link this to maxwell equations , we now consider , as an example , a te electromagnetic wave ( where the magnetic field has only one non - zero @xmath16 component ) propagating in a homogeneous medium , and introduce two complex - valued functions @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the medium impedance , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the medium permeability and permittivity , accordingly . in ref .  , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the reimann - silberstain vector wave functions were used to derive a quantum - mechanical , matrix form of the classical wave equations in the general case of arbitrary electromagnetic fields propagating in media with space - dependent permittivity and permeability . the analogy with the relativistic dirac equations",
    "was noted .",
    "it is easy to show that for monochromatic fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 [ the time dependence is given by @xmath23 , the maxwell equations yield @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the medium refractive index , and @xmath26 .",
    "it is evident that after the replacement @xmath27 eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) coincide with eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "namely , the 2d maxwell equations for the complex effective fields ( [ eq3 ] ) in a homogeneous medium , and the dirac equations for the wave functions of the charge carriers in graphene become identical .",
    "the role of the refractive index of the corresponding effective medium is played by the quantity @xmath28 . therefore if , for example , the potential is a piecewise - constant function of one coordinate , the corresponding graphene superlattice models a layered dielectric structure @xcite .",
    "in particular , a layer , in which the potential @xmath9 exceeds the energy @xmath11 of the particle , @xmath29 , is similar to a slab with negative refractive index @xmath25 .",
    "this means that a junction of two regions having opposite signs of @xmath30 is similar to an interface between left- and right - handed dielectric media with the refractive indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , if @xmath33 because of this similarity , a @xmath2 junction can focus dirac electrons in graphene @xcite in the same way as the focusing of electromagnetic waves by the boundary between a normal dielectric and a metamaterial @xcite .",
    "however it is important to realize that , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , a change of @xmath11 necessarily implies the corresponding change of the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "thus , to model the same ( i.e. , with fixed values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) graphene bi - layer structure , but at different energies , one has to chose different pairs of dielectrics .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) that the energy spectrum of the charge carriers in graphene in a homogeneous potential @xmath37 is linear near @xmath38 , i.e. , consists of two cones touching at the dirac point ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath39 after substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) looks exactly like the dispersion law ( [ eq1 ] ) for photons .",
    "whilst eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are akin , the similarity between the two problems is not complete .",
    "first , unlike dirac wavefunctions , the genuine electromagnetic fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 are real , i.e. , equal to their complex conjugates . due to this , positive and negative frequencies ( upper and lower cones in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) correspond to the same fields , in contrast to a dirac spinor , which describes electrons , when @xmath42 , and holes , when @xmath43 .",
    "one further distinction is that the electric field @xmath40 satisfies the continuity condition @xmath44 which is not required for the dirac wave functions .",
    "essentially different are also the boundary conditions for the dirac wave functions at the interface between two half - spaces with potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47and for the effective electromagnetic fields @xmath21 and @xmath48 at the boundary between two dielectrics : @xmath49equations  ( [ eq10 ] ) follow from the boundary conditions for the real fields , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( the boundary is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath52 axis ) .",
    "although the charge transport in graphene and the light propagation in dielectrics are governed by similar equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) inside the medium , the boundary conditions ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) are distinct from each other .",
    "this means that , generally speaking , the coupling between adjacent samples in these two cases is different .",
    "this difference is more conspicuous in the particular case of a monochromatic plane wave , @xmath53 $ ] , when the boundary conditions for the effective fields take the form : @xmath54=\\mathcal{e}_2\\left[1+ik_y / k_{1x}% \\right ] ,   \\label{bc}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath55 .",
    "it is easy to see that eqs .",
    "( eq9 ) and ( [ bc ] ) coincide only when @xmath56 ( normal incidence ) and @xmath57 .",
    "that is , in this particular instance , the transmission of dirac electrons through a junction is similar to the transmission of light through an interface between two media with different refractive indices but equal impedances . in other words , at normal incidence , any junction in graphene , either @xmath3 , @xmath58 , or @xmath2 , is analogous to a contact between two perfectly - matched dielectrics or microwave elements .",
    "such an interface is absolutely transparent to the _ normally - incident _ radiation and therefore to the dirac electrons in graphene as well .",
    "this provides a more intuitive insight into the physics of the klein paradox ( perfect transmission through a high potential barrier @xcite ) in graphene systems .",
    "to compare the transport properties of dirac electrons and light in the general case of oblique incidence , @xmath59 , we first consider the transmission of particles through a step - like potential barrier , i.e. through the line @xmath60 separating two domains ( 1 and 2 ) of a graphene sheet with different values @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the potential . in",

    "when two touching spectral cones form a point - like gap , the electromagnetic radiation interacts with the same sample differently , depending to which cone its frequency belongs .",
    "studies of the propagation of beams of light show that only the diabolic points of this type posses the properties of genuine dirac points .",
    "we demonstrate that in mono - type layered structures ( i.e. , in those built of either normal or left - handed dielectrics ) just the diabolic point of the first type can exist , and conical , dirac - type singularities appear only in mixed ( with alternating left- and right - handed layers ) samples .",
    "this is in contrast to two - dimensional media where dirac points were discovered in various types of photonic crystals with normal dielectric elements .",
    "it is important to note that the physical nature of the dirac points that we consider is different from that in systems with zero average value of the refractive index : in mixed layered structures , they are due to the specific strong dispersion ( phase and group velocities have different signs ) inherent in the elements with negative refraction .",
