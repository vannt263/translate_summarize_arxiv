    "differentiation of the standard cosmological redshift @xcite @xmath0 gives the mcvittie equation @xcite @xmath1 where the @xmath2 - derivative is evaluated today .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 is very difficult to detect @xcite is due to the fact that @xmath5 is , in human terms , so very small ( @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath5 in km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 where , according to all observations , @xmath9 ) .",
    "nonetheless , almost 50 years ago sandage @xcite tried to make ( [ mcvittie ] ) an observational tool but concluded that this was not possible given the technology available to him .",
    "about 30 years ago davis and may @xcite , with appropriate caution , suggested that direct measurements of @xmath4 might be feasible on timescales of decades .",
    "there have been arguments that peculiar accelerations would invalidate attempts to measure ( [ mcvittie ] ) @xcite countered by arguments that in a suitable sample this would not be the case @xcite .",
    "the latter argument seems to have survived and it was loeb @xcite , many years later , who pointed out that the ly@xmath10 absorption - line forest on the continuum flux from quasars could provide an ideal template for the observation of @xmath4 .",
    "recently , corasaniti , huterer and melchiorri @xcite have reviewed some of the many ambitious proposals afoot for new generations of very large telescopes along with spectrographs of unprecedented resolution @xcite .",
    "in particular , the codex ( cosmic dynamics experiment ) spectrograph should be able to detect @xmath4 in distant quasi - stellar objects ( @xmath11 ) over a single decade @xcite .",
    "it would seem that observations of @xmath4 might , in the relatively short term , finally be within our grasp .",
    "however , the usefulness of such observations would , as we show here , not be restricted to high redshifts .",
    "low redshift ( @xmath12 ) ly@xmath10 systems ( which requires uv space - based systems ) have already produced results @xcite but much improvement will be needed to actually measure the low - redshift effects discussed here .    assuming @xmath5 is known @xcite , ( [ mcvittie ] ) provides cosmological information through @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , for any background model , all properties of the model can be obtained by taking higher @xmath2 - derivatives of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath2 - derivatives of order @xmath15 produce factors of @xmath16 and so this approach will remain of theoretical interest but of no practical value beyond @xmath17 . throughout the present analysis @xmath17 .",
    "the approach used here is to explicitly use the redshift information contained within @xmath18 itself so that no higher powers of @xmath5 enter . in this regard",
    "it is useful to start with a comparison of the standard approach based on luminosity ( or other well - defined ) cosmological distances .",
    "the standard approach in cosmology is to fit measurements to a truncated taylor series approximation to the luminosity distance which , in general , we can write as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "we start with the expansion @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( and , as usual , @xmath23 means @xmath24 etc . ) .",
    "it is customary to evaluate the coefficients in the taylor expansion in terms of @xmath2 - derivatives of the scale factor evaluated at @xmath25 . to do this",
    "consider @xmath26 fixed and look back along the past null cone to write the familiar relation @xmath27 this must not be confused with the notation used for @xmath4 in ( [ mcvittie ] ) . from ( [ taylor ] ) and ( [ othertdot ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are dimensionless constants with @xmath30 but the @xmath29 for @xmath31 contain time derivatives of the scale factor ( @xmath32 ) of order up to @xmath33 and terms at that order of differentiation come in linearly @xcite . whereas the use of @xmath34 is standard",
    ", it is not necessarily the best distance measure to use @xcite .",
    "( note , however , that the use of other distance measures merely changes the power of @xmath35 in ( [ luminosity ] ) and this does not change the fundamentals of the procedure under discussion . )",
    "moreover , let us note here that one need never introduce @xmath2 derivatives but rather one could proceed directly from ( [ luminosity ] ) , or any other well - defined distance . for @xmath34 , for example , we find ( [ taylorl ] ) with @xmath30 but now with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and so on , where @xmath18 is defined by ( [ mcvittie ] ) ( and , as usual , @xmath38 means @xmath39 etc . ) .",
    "it is at this order , @xmath40 , that a degeneracy ( the last term above ) enters @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath14 derivatives can , of course , be directly related to the more usual expansion in terms of @xmath2 derivatives . in particular , one easily finds @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the standard deceleration and jerk parameters @xcite . despite",
    "what distance measure one chooses to use , the quantities @xmath45 and so on , enter by way of series approximation only . in the approach",
    "i discuss here , based on ( [ mcvittie ] ) , this is not the case : encoded in @xmath4 , given @xmath5 , is @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47 , @xmath48 and so on and not just their values at @xmath49 . in a sense then what we consider here is a natural generalization of the cosmographic approach .",
    "the use of ( [ mcvittie ] ) clearly offers tremendous theoretical advantage over @xmath34 , or other measures of distance , as ( [ mcvittie ] ) makes no assumptions other than the cosmological principle itself .",
    "however , we must assume a background model given , say , by way of the friedmann function @xmath50 , a standard procedure @xcite . in this sense",
    "the present approach differs fundamentally from the use of any distances since that approach is kinematic . in practical terms",
    ", however , it is necessary to assume that @xmath46 , when such observations become practical , will be able to be measured with sufficient accuracy and precision in order to reliably produce derivatives .",
    "this is the central assumption made here .",
    "whereas one should obviously never differentiate noisy data , quality data of the type needed may eventually play an important role in cosmology and the view taken here is that the associated theory is worth exploration . in what follows",
    "we consider various cosmological models and express the associated model parameters in terms of the observables , @xmath18 and its @xmath14 derivatives .",
    "( in a very recent paper , balbi and quercellini @xcite have also explored a variety of interesting cosmological models . in terms of the present analysis ,",
    "their examination is restricted to a study of @xmath18 alone . )",
    "it is to be reemphasized that no series approximations are used .",
    "the resultant formulae are , albeit superficially clumsy at times , exact .",
    "consider an arbitrary number of non - interacting species @xcite so that @xmath51 if we are interested in the direct measurement of cosmological parameters ( say the @xmath52 for the above model , assuming the constants @xmath53 are given ) via @xmath4 alone , then we must recognize that ( [ mcvittie ] ) ( given ( [ species ] ) ) provides but one equation when there are @xmath54 unknowns for @xmath55 species .",
    "( the boundary condition on ( [ species ] ) is the @xmath56 limit @xmath57 . ) for example , in the lcdm model ( [ mcvittie ] ) alone can provide unambiguous cosmological information only if the universe is , say , assumed to be spatially flat a priori .",
    "that is , there is no test of the assumption of flatness available .",
    "the idea exploited here is to explicitly use the redshift information contained within @xmath18 itself so that no higher powers of @xmath5 enter and to exploit this information so that we do not have to assume flatness .",
    "specifically , in terms of the observables @xmath18 and @xmath47 we find the following exact relations within the lcdm model : @xmath58 for the dust ( including dark matter ) and @xmath59 since @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constants , ( [ dust ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) provide internal consistency checks on the lcdm model as we explore @xmath46 .",
    "let us note that with the aide of lhpital s rule as @xmath62 ( and note that we have to go to the second derivative ) , along with equations ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ jerk ] ) , we find that ( [ dust ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) reduce to @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that @xmath65 .",
    "further , we have the following internal explicit test for flatness within the @xmath66cdm model : @xmath67 introducing the additional observable @xmath48 , we can also perform an explicit internal check on the constancy of @xmath66 without the assumption of flatness . in particular",
    ", it must follow from the observations that @xmath68 or the lcdm model fails .",
    "the foregoing procedure can of course be applied to any model , not just the standard lcdm model .",
    "one popular trend today , despite the lovelock theorem @xcite , is to generalize the lcdm model by removing the assumption that @xmath70 and to replace it with a free ( and often entirely ad hoc ) constant parameter @xmath71 .",
    "for example , under the assumption of spatial flatness we then have @xmath72 so that @xmath73 and @xmath74 with the aide of ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ jerk ] ) then @xmath75 and @xmath76 compared with @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the flat lcdm model . the situation is summarized in figures [ zw ] and [ zddw ] .",
    "these diagrams suggest , for example , that @xmath79 could be obtained from @xmath47 at high redshift and compared with @xmath18 in the same redshift range .",
    "further , @xmath71 might be obtained from @xmath18 at high redshift and compared to @xmath71 obtained from @xmath47 and @xmath48 at low redshift to check the assumption @xmath80 .",
    "although such a comparison would require very different technologies , this comparison serves to point out that the usefulness of @xmath4 observations would not be restricted to high redshifts .",
    "if we assume spatial flatness and continue to use @xmath81 and @xmath48 as obervables then we need not assume @xmath71 is constant . rather , we can actually solve for @xmath82 . in the usual way we now obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 in this case writing @xmath69 we find @xmath85 and @xmath86 where now @xmath82 follows from @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant ( provided by the theory that gives @xmath82 ) and the observables @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "are given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 note that @xmath93 does not enter .",
    "it should be clear that the introduction of @xmath94 as an observable would allow us to map out @xmath82 without the assumption of spatial flatness , but the associated algebra is not repeated here .",
    "as a check of the above let us note that if we use ( [ flatness ] ) in ( [ dust ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) , or @xmath95 and ( [ flatness ] ) in ( [ mvar ] ) and ( [ wvar ] ) , we obtain the following simple forms for the flat @xmath66cdm model : @xmath96 and @xmath97 so that now the @xmath98 limit gives us the familiar relations ( [ omegaq ] ) and ( [ omegaj ] ) with @xmath99 . similarly , substituting from ( [ flatness ] ) into ( [ lambdaexplicit ] ) , or @xmath95 into the derivative of ( [ wdot ] ) and using ( [ flatness ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 which , in addition to a check on the foregoing , reiterates the fact that the only observable needed in the flat lcdm case is @xmath18 alone .",
    "the idea that the accelerated universe could be the result of extra dimensions - for example , the so - called dgp models @xcite , is widely discussed in the literature .",
    "cosmological tests based on @xmath34 in these models have been studied by deffayet , dvali and gabadadze @xcite and more recently by maartens and majerotto @xcite .",
    "here we consider the spatially flat case so that we need only consider @xmath18 . in this model",
    "we have @xmath101 so that subject to the boundary condition @xmath3 we have @xmath102 so that @xmath103 and @xmath104 again with the aide of ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ jerk ] ) we now have @xmath105 and @xmath106 relation ( [ flatbranez ] ) can be compared with the spatially flat lcdm model where from ( [ specialm ] ) we obtain @xmath107 so that @xmath108 and of course @xmath78 .",
    "a comparison is carried out in figures [ lcdmb ] and [ lcddmbc ] .",
    "the most noticeable feature is perhaps the fact that for the same @xmath109 the models predict rather different values for @xmath43 and @xmath44.this again serves to point out that the usefulness of @xmath4 observations would not be restricted to high redshifts .",
    "it is natural to consider the coupling between dark energy and matter and there are many explicit coupling procedures considered in the literature . here",
    "we use the parametrization of majerotto , sapone and amendola @xcite to write @xmath110 and setting @xmath111 , @xmath112 and considering the spatially flat case we have @xmath113 so that with @xmath114 we recover the lcdm model and ( [ interactingflat ] ) reduces to ( [ specialz ] ) .",
    "we now have @xmath115 exactly as in the lcdm model , and @xmath116 again with the aide of ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ jerk ] ) we now have @xmath117 and @xmath118 a comparison is carried out in figures [ lcdint ] and [ lcddint ] .",
    "measurements of @xmath4 of sufficient quality , without the introduction of further time derivatives , would not only allow a detailed verification of the lcdm model with a minimum number of assumptions , but also a mapping of the dark energy equation of state @xmath82 should the lcdm model fail .",
    "the procedure given here can be immediately applied to any model for which @xmath119 can be written out explicitly .",
    "a consideration of brane - world scenarios and interacting dark energy models serves to emphasize the fact that the usefulness of such observations would not be restricted to high redshifts .",
    "[ sec : texbooks ] we use a standard robertson - walker background with scale factor @xmath120 , where @xmath2 is the proper time of comoving observers , and write @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
