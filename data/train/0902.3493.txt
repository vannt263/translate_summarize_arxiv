    "redshifted observations of the 21-cm spin - flip transition of neutral hydrogen ( ) trace the cool component of the gas in distant galaxies .",
    "since the surface brightness has a @xmath4 dependence , the detection of the 21-cm in emission is very difficult at redshifts of @xmath0 , and so the neutral gas in distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is usually studied in absorption .",
    "furthermore , since most published searches survey of @xcite .",
    "] have been at redshifts of @xmath5 , there are generally no observations of the lyman-  transition , which is redshifted into the optical bands at @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , to date 21-cm absorption has been the most common probe of the neutral gas in the galaxies host to agn , being detected in approximately 40% of @xmath7 cases ( see @xcite ) .    in order to explain the detection rate , many studies invoke unified schemes of active galactic nuclei , which attempt to unify the many classes of luminous extragalactic object , a key element of which is the presence of a torus of highly obscuring circumnuclear material : in these schemes , the appearance of the object is dependent upon the orientation of this material along our line - of - sight to the nucleus @xcite , with the popular consensus being that only type-2 objects present a dense column of intervening gas , which can absorb in 21-cm ( see @xcite , figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "other observational examples of this include :    1 .   from a survey for 21-cm absorption in 23 radio galaxies ,",
    "@xcite find that of the five detections , four occur in sources which could be considered type-2 objects , whereas there is only one detected case for a type-1 object .",
    "2 .   from a study of 49",
    "gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , @xcite find that 21-cm absorption is more likely to arise in objects classified as galaxies , rather than in quasars . since the former are generally considered to be type-2 objects , while latter are type-1 objects , this is consistent with the orientation of the central obscuration playing a major rle in producing strong 21-cm absorption along our sight - line .",
    "also , from a study of 27 gpss and csss , @xcite find that 21-cm absorption is twice as likely to be detected in the galaxies than in the quasars of the sample , again suggesting that the absorption occurs in the dense sub - parsec torus .",
    "4 .   from a sample of 23 galaxies and 9 quasars , @xcite",
    "find that 15 of the galaxies exhibit 21-cm absorption , compared to just a single case for the quasars .",
    "like @xcite , this is consistent with unified schemes , where galaxies are host to edge - on obscurations , whereas quasars have their tori oriented more face - on .",
    "however , the situation may be more complex than this with evidence that 21-cm absorption may also be due to in - falling gas or outflows ( e.g. @xcite ) , and if these are directed along the radio jet axis , we would expect outflows of neutral gas to render absorption detectable towards type-1 sources . whether due to an outflow or the presence of an intervening circumnuclear obscuration , these scenarios are consistent with unified schemes of agn , playing a major rle in whether  21-cm absorption is detected .    therefore , from these possibilities in addition to absorption by the large reservoir of neutral gas in the galactic disk , we may expect a high 21-cm detection rate in distant radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "however , from a recent survey of the host galaxies of @xmath8 quasars , @xcite found no evidence of absorption in any of the ten sources searched . upon an analysis of the spectral types of the targets , as well as those of all the other @xmath0 published searches , they found the non - detections all to be type-1 objects , as are many of the lower redshift non - detections ( see fig .",
    "[ lum - z ] ) .",
    "superficially , this suggests that the orientation of the circumnuclear obscuration may be key in the detection of 21-cm absorption , although there may also be other effects at play , the evidence for which we discuss in this paper .",

    ", one needs to consider the wider picture of the quasar host galaxy and its environment .",
    "a great deal is known about the host galaxies of luminous agn at low redshift .",
    "imaging studies , particularly with hst , of @xmath113 quasars @xcite , indicate that early - type or spheroidal hosts are much more likely for high - luminosity quasars , and that almost all luminous radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are to be found in elliptical galaxies .    studies at higher redshift , often with ground - based adaptive optics @xcite show a slightly more complex picture .",
    "the luminous quasars tend to follow the same trend , with elliptical / early - type hosts predominant , although it is more difficult to gain a confident picture of the host morphology at these redshifts .",
    "using gravitationally - lensed quasars can provide some extra resolution , from which @xcite find that quasar hosts at @xmath114 span a range of morphologies from early - type to disky / late - type galaxies .",
    "determining the expected  content of typical quasar host galaxies is difficult , as 21-cm absorption is often the only way to probe the neutral gas at such redshifts . for low redshifts ,",
    "21-cm emission studies are possible with much being gleaned from blind surveys : the hipass survey had detection rates of 6% for rc3 ellipticals and",
    "13% for s0s @xcite and from the alfalfa survey , @xcite detected  in just 2 - 3% of bright early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster , with only one of these ( m86 , an s0 ) having @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "@xcite , however , examined early - type galaxies in low - density environments , and found a higher detection fraction of  emission for the more luminous objects , although neither of the two ellipticals with @xmath115 were detected .    targeted searches with interferometers @xcite show different results .",
    "the detection fraction tends to be much larger than in the blind surveys , with a mix of ordered , relaxed disks and more complex interacting systems seen .",
    "however , these have mostly been limited to fairly local galaxies , although a small number of more powerful ( yet still nearby compared to our sample , @xmath117 ) radio galaxies have been observed to have  disks as well as tails , resulting from an interaction , which often coincide with  absorption .",
    "one such example is ngc612 @xcite , an s0 galaxy with a large neutral disk of gas , likely originating in an interaction or merger .",
    "however , hosts luminous agn are very rare in the local universe , making a clear understanding of the  properties elusive",
    ".    the above can provide qualitative description of why we see the cut - off in the absorption distribution at high luminosities , where the the hosts tend to be the larger elliptical galaxies .",
    "for instance , the low - redshift luminous agn imaged by the hst all have elliptical hosts @xcite and @xmath118 , which corresponds to a @xmath11-band luminosity of @xmath119   similar to the brightest sources in our sample . regarding the @xmath120  sources of our sample , of the five imaged ,",
    "two have resolved host galaxies both of which are ellipticals ( j1540 + 1447 ; @xcite and j2250 + 1419 ; @xcite ) .    to summarise , at lower luminosities the observed morphological mix could present a range of  column densities , whereas at higher luminosities the hosts are expected to be gas - poor ellipticals , resulting in a lack of 21-cm absorption .",
    "this could give a mix of 21-cm detections at low redshift and exclusive non - detections at high redshift ( fig .",
    "[ lum - z ] ) .",
    "however , the bulk of the @xmath0 sample has not been observed with a resolution sufficient to determine the host galaxy morphologies , so that , while we do have a good understanding of how the 21-cm detections are distributed with @xmath73 , how these are distributed with morphology for this sample is at present undetermined .",
    "in addition to any possible evolution in the host galaxy environments , selection effects may arise from the large range of beam sizes and radio source sizes over what constitutes a heterogeneous sample ( all radio sources at @xmath0 searched for 21-cm absorption ) .",
    "for example , a @xmath121 diameter beam ( a typical lower value for the gmrt at 90-cm , @xcite ) covers a linear extent of 18 kpc at @xmath122 , @xmath123 kpc ( the maximum ) at @xmath124 and 63 kpc at @xmath125 . that is , the area subtended by a given telescope beam can vary by a factor of @xmath126 due to the redshift range alone , an effect which is compounded by the published searches being performed with numerous instruments / configurations , each with its own beam size .",
    "this can , in principle , affect the sensitivity to 21-cm absorption .",
    "for instance , absorption can be missed in near - by seyfert galaxies by lower resolution observations , while being revealed on vlba / merlin scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the radio source sizes and the bias these may have on the effective coverage of the background emission must be considered .",
    "this , however , is fraught with uncertainties as the heterogeneity of the sample combined with the very different scales probed , will contribute to diluting out any strong trends in the linear extents of the sources . further compounding",
    "this is the fact that the radio emission can exhibit very different structure at different frequencies and , although the sizes used are from the nearest available frequencies , vlbi and vlba continuum observations are typically at @xmath127 ghz , significantly higher than that of the redshifted 21-cm line .",
    "the only way to fully address this would be through dedicated mapping of the 21-cm absorption ( e.g. @xcite ) , although the available vlba bands would only allow this at redshifts of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , thus covering only six of the sample ( all of which are non - detections in any case ) .    ) of the 21-cm absorption versus the linear extent of the radio source size ( from the references listed in tables [ dets ] and [ non - dets ] . ) .",
    "the symbols are as per fig .",
    "[ lum - z ] , where the downwards arrows signify the upper limits to the non - detections .",
    "the five detections not classified as compact objects ( cso , css , gps nor hfp , defined in sect .",
    "[ drco ] ) are circled . ]    nevertheless , applying these source sizes , in fig .",
    "[ tau - size ] we see the same `` column density '' ( actually the velocity integrated optical depth)linear size anti - correlation reported for the gps and css sources by @xcite : a kendall s @xmath130-test on the detections gives a two - sided probability @xmath131 of the correlation arising by chance , which is significant at @xmath132 assuming gaussian statistics . including the 21-cm non - detections , through the asurv survival analysis package @xcite , decreases this to @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "if we consider just the gps and css sources @xcite it appears that _ all _ of the detections follow the same @xmath135linear size correlation as is seen for the compact objects only @xcite , although this is based upon the small number of non - compact objects ( five ) . ] , we obtain @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , which nonetheless indicates that the inclusion of the non - detections significantly worsens the correlation .",
    "this suggests that the 21-cm non - detections may be subject to an additional effect .",
    "this could be due to smaller absorption cross - sections further reducing the covering factor , generally higher spin temperatures and/or lower neutral hydrogen column densities , all of which could be due to both orientation and uv luminosity effects .",
    "although the decrease in the `` column density '' is most likely due to a decrease in the covering factor with increasing with linear extent , there is also the possibility that the 21-cm absorption towards the larger sources is more susceptible to dilution by the extended 21-cm emission .",
    "however , in spite of the four orders of magnitude span in size , we find no significant difference in the detection rates between the smaller ( @xmath138 kpc , 16 out of 42 ) and the larger ( @xmath139 kpc , 11 out of 36 ) sources ( fig .",
    "[ tau - size ] ) , indicating that this is not a strong effect .",
    "if the 21-cm non - detections are due to orientation effects , it would suggest that all of the @xmath140  sources are type-1 objects and therefore the gas may only necessarily be ionised along our line - of - sight , which is direct to the agn . to examine this question , we make use of the spectral classifications obtained by @xcite .",
    "these were compiled by exhaustively searching the literature for published emission - line fluxes or spectra .",
    "sources with broad permitted lines were classified as type-1 and those with only narrow lines as type-2 .",
    "our classifications generally agree with those of @xcite , except for 2316 + 0405 which we assign as type-2 @xcite , although @xcite have this classified as a broad line radio galaxy .    using these classifications",
    ", it is apparent that all the high uv luminosity sources are indeed type-1 ( fig.[lum - z ] ) .",
    "however , they appear to be distinct from the population of lower uv luminous type-1 objects , some of which have been detected in 21-cm absorption at , somewhat surprisingly , the same detection rate ( 50% ) as for the type-2 objects .",
    "that is , the overall bias towards type-1 non - detections is caused by the inclusion of the @xmath69  non - detections .",
    "therefore , the ultra - violet luminosity of the object appears to have much more bearing on whether 21-cm absorption can be detected and , at moderate uv luminosities , the agn type provides no indicator of whether a high column of cold neutral gas is likely to intercept our sight - line .    nevertheless , as has been noted in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , 21-cm absorption is more likely to be detected in a radio galaxy than in a quasar , even if there are even odds between the two agn types .",
    "we designate each object in our sample as either a quasar or a galaxy , using the classifications from @xcite . to obtain these , optical imaging and spectroscopy from the literature were used to distinguish sources dominated by the nuclear source ( the `` quasars '' ) from those dominated by the extended stellar light of the host galaxy ( the `` galaxies '' ) , the latter being either weaker agn or relatively obscured type-2 agn .",

    ". however , the quasars in which 21-cm has been detected are generally an order of magnitude brighter than the galaxies , with the whole quasar sample being another order of magnitude brighter yet ( with only a 17% detection rate ) .",
    "again , over and above an underlying 50% due to orientation effects , this strongly suggests that it is the ultra - violet luminosity which is the key criterion in the detection of  in these objects and that any detection bias against the quasars is due to their generally higher ultra - violet output .",
    "until the 7251200 mhz survey of @xcite , there were few detections of associated 21-cm absorption at @xmath0 . of",
    "the @xcite detections most ( 17 out of 19 ) are gigahertz peaked spectrum and compact steep spectrum sources , with the general consensus being that these exhibit higher 21-cm detection rates than other radio sources , due to their gas rich - host galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "csss and gpss are believed to be intrinsically small ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 kpc , respectively ) and may be the young precursors of the typically large radio sources , themselves evolving from compact symmetric objects ( csos , @xcite ) .",
    "although the high occurrence of broad forbidden lines may suggest that these are primarily type-1 objects , in which the compact appearance is due to the radio lobes being directed along our sight - line , the diminished sizes are not believed to be due to projection effects @xcite : although there are radio lobes present , the jets may be embedded in a dusty interstellar medium so that the agn is believed to be subject to significant extinction ( e.g. @xcite ) , resulting in strong radio emission as the trapped jets interact with the rich , dense cocoon , in this early evolutionary stage .",
    "the possibility that csss and gpss are compact type-1 objects , would be consistent with the 21-cm absorption being , on average , blue - shifted with respect to the optical redshift ( @xcite , see sect .",
    "[ adto ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the efficient coverage of the confined radio core could contribute to a high incidence of 21-cm absorption , which probably occurs in an outflow .",

    "nine type-2s ( and two unclassified , table  [ dets ] ) , which again may suggest that these objects have random orientations , with the possibility of absorption arising in either an outflow or the disk .",

[ uv - radio ] ) .",

    "although we may expect the gas to be nearly coplanar on all scales ( e.g. @xcite ) , if the large - scale disk is the source of the absorption , the fact that both types of agn have the same odds of exhibiting 21-cm absorption would suggest that the orientation of the large - scale disk with respect to the small - scale obscuring torus is random .    at redshifts of @xmath0 ,",
    "the disk orientations can not generally be determined , although from lower redshift seyfert studies we can show the inclination of the galaxy disk for various seyfert types ( fig .",

    "however , from the vertical histogram ( fig .",

    "[ n - colour ]  sources have @xmath195 . ]",

    "this could be a reflection of the heterogeneous nature of the sample . ]",
    ", some of which will also be subject to contamination from starlight , although we have previously found that the molecular , rather than atomic , gas content appears to dominate the degree of reddening @xcite .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we found that the ultra - violet luminosity plays more of a rle than the agn type in the detection of 21-cm absorption in @xmath0 radio galaxies _ and _ quasars . specifically , to date , 21-cm absorption has never been detected in a host galaxy when @xmath140 .",
    "although these high uv luminosities occur exclusively in type-1 objects , for the moderately uv luminous ( @xmath112 ) sample there is a 50% probability of detection in _ either _ agn type , with any apparent bias against type-1 objects being caused by the 17 high uv luminosity objects . expanding upon these results , in this paper",
    "we show :    1 .   that the bias against 21-cm absorption in quasars , compared to radio galaxies , also appears to be due to uv luminosity effects : for the radio galaxies ,",
    "the 21-cm detections and non - detections both arise in objects with a mean @xmath196 , whereas the 21-cm detected quasars have @xmath197 , with the non - detected quasars having @xmath198 .",
    "although there is this decrease in the 21-cm detection rate with increasing @xmath73 , it is possible that the exclusive 21-cm non - detections at @xmath140  are due to the fact that highly luminous sources are believed to trace the ( neutral ) gas - poor elliptical galaxies .",
    "however only two of the 17 @xmath140  sources are _ known _ to be located in ellipticals ( although all of them could be ) , whereas all are known to have high ultra - violet luminosities .",
    "therefore it is not clear whether the lack of 21-cm absorption is due to a low abundance of neutral galaxy in the host or excitation effects caused by the high luminosities , or indeed how these two scenarios may be related .",
    "the exclusion of the @xmath140 sources , the skew towards the detection of 21-cm absorption in compact objects ( cso / css / gps / hfp ) becomes much less significant .",
    "again , this indicates a bias introduced by the high uv luminosity sample and perhaps suggests that it is more meaningful to discuss the 21-cm absorption incidence in terms of the rest frame ultra - violet luminosities rather than by agn type or radio sed classifications .",
    "regarding the @xmath112  sources , in addition to both agn types having a 50% detection rate , there is no evidence for the expected larger degree of reddening in the type-2 objects , which would be caused by the presence of a dusty obscuration .",
    "we do find , however , that the optical  near - infrared colour appears to be correlated with the 21-cm absorption line strength over the _",
    "these points would therefore appear to contradict the notion that the 21-cm optical depth in the hosts of high redshift galaxies and quasars is determined by the orientation of the central obscuring torus .",
    "although , like the literature , we find a higher incidence of 21-cm absorption in galaxies than in quasars , unlike the literature , we believe this to be a consequence of their lower ultra - violet luminosities , rather than their agn classification  is not likely to be coincidental .",
    "they do , however , seem to be quite distinct from their lower uv luminosity counterparts , which exhibit the same 21-cm detection rate as the type-2 objects . ] .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the reddening is also independent of agn type , suggests that this is also unrelated to the torus and the correlation between the reddening and the absorption line strength suggests that the bulk  and dust share a similar ( non - nuclear ) distribution .",
    "this could explain why only a fraction of  absorbing agn are detection in -maser emission @xcite : -masers are believed to arise close to the black hole in the central obscuration @xcite and thus trace type-2 objects .",
    "therefore , if  absorption also arose in the torus , one would expect a high detection rate of -masers in agn detected in  absorption .",
    "however , @xcite find  and  common to only 8 out of 19 objects searched and this 42% rate is very close to the overall  detection rate in agn ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this therefore suggests that the lines - of - sight through the masing disk and the  absorbing clouds are randomly oriented with respect to one another .    in the moderate uv luminous sample ,",
    "not dominated by elliptical hosts , we therefore argue that the absorption may be occuring in the main galactic disk which must be randomly oriented with respect to the torus . in attempting to verify this :    1 .",
    "we find no real difference in the full - width half maxima of the 21-cm absorption profiles between the two agn types .",
    "this may suggest that these are subject to geometric effects ( covering factors and radio source sizes ) and thus can not give the full kinematical picture .",
    "although , again , absorption due to a randomly oriented disk could account for this .",
    "we also find no discernible difference in the offset of the centroid of the absorption and the systemic velocity of the host between the two agn types .",
    "although through a sample nearly double in size , we can confirm the findings of @xcite , that on average the offsets are blue - shifted .",
    "that is , there _ may be _ evidence for outflowing gas , although , again , we see no distinction between the two agn types .",
    "if the galactic disk were aligned with the obscuring torus , the 50% detection rate for _ both _ agn types suggests that absorption must occur in both galactic disks _ and _ outflows : the outflowing gas is expected to be directed along the radio jets ( e.g. @xcite ) , which are coincident with the axis of the torus , thus giving rise to the absorption in the type-1 objects .",
    "the fact that we can not discriminate between the disk and outflow absorption would suggest rapid , wide outflows of cold neutral gas , perhaps enveloping the wide ionisation cones observed in low redshift agn ( see table 1.2 of @xcite)@xmath199 .",
    "a 90  wide outflow of cool neutral gas expanding at @xmath200 , in which the molecular gas mass rivals that in the disk ( @xmath201 ) , is known of in the circinus galaxy @xcite , the proximate type-2 seyfert ( see also @xcite for further examples ) .",
    "however , it would therefore remain a mystery as to why only 50% of each agn type ( of @xmath112 ) are detected in 21-cm absorption , although the bulk absorption occuring in the galactic disk , which is randomly oriented with respect to the obscuring torus , could account for this . +",
