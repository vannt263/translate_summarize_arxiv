    "it is immediately apparent that as @xmath0 increases , the objective function acquires additional local extrema .    for the @xmath22 case ,",
    "the global optimum found is @xmath90 at @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which is only marginally short of the best known value of @xmath93 found from optimizing many different classes of potential @xcite .",
    "the global maximum lies at the top of the long , narrow ridge viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig : betaresults](d ) , a feature of the objective function that was also seen in earlier studies of more complicated potentials @xcite .",
    "its presence implies that @xmath6 is much less sensitive to one of the parameters than the other , which can be quantified by computing the hessian matrix of @xmath6 with respect to the parameters ,    @xmath94 and finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "these quantities respectively measure the curvature and principal directions of the objective function around the maximum .",
    "we previously used this technique in @xcite to show that that while the best known value of @xmath93 was obtained by optimizing a piecewise linear potential with 6 free parameters , in fact @xmath6 was effectively only sensitive to 2 - 3 parameters at the optimum . here , the eigenvalues of the hessian evaluated at the global maximum of @xmath6 are @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the associated eigenvectors are @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "hence , @xmath6 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath10 , the second parameter and much less sensitive to the value of @xmath27 ; since the eigenvectors are nearly parallel to basis vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 in parameter spaceas is visible from the orientation of the ridge in fig .",
    "[ fig : betaresults](d)it is clear that @xmath6 is sensitive to these features of the potential specifically , and not some combination of them .",
    "in contrast , the eigenvectors in @xcite were not well aligned with the parameter space and so it was not possible to ascribe high @xmath6 to particular features of the potential .",
    "the design advice from this study is much clearer : to optimize @xmath6 , create an asymmetric potential well with a steep wall on one side , i.e. set @xmath101 ; then add an attractive group in the center and tune the strength of attraction , i.e. carefully adjust @xmath10 as this largely determines @xmath6 .",
    "a similar analysis was applied to the multi - electron case . in table",
    "[ tab : beta ] , we display the three extrema with largest @xmath6 for @xmath79 , together with a plot of the potential and wavefunctions ; parameter values of @xmath27 and @xmath32 at the optimum and the results of the eigenanalysis . unlike the @xmath22 case , the global optimum has a repulsive @xmath32-function ; the next two solutions have attractive @xmath32-functions .",
    "the existence of both attractive and repulsive extrema supports the paradigm proposed by lytel _",
    "_ @xcite in their work on optimization of quantum graphs .",
    "they suggest that large @xmath6 is achieved by introducing a disturbance at some point in the @xmath102-electron chain of molecule , e.g the addition of a side group .",
    "the disturbance then induces a phase shift in the wavefunction , producing a change in dipole moments sufficient to achieve large @xmath6 . in our work",
    ", the @xmath32-function serves to provide the disturbance ; the insight of lytel _ et al .",
    "_ is that it is the overall phase shift at the disturbance that is the relevant parameter , not its detailed nature .",
    "hence both attractive and repulsive features can provide an appropriate phase shift .",
    "just as for the @xmath22 case above , eigenanalysis of the hessian for the multi - electron case shows that the eigenvectors remain well aligned with the parameter basis vectors for the multi - electron case .",
    "surprisingly , while @xmath10 was found to be the most important parameter for @xmath22 , it is @xmath27 that appears to be most significant for the @xmath79 case .",
    "the ratio of eigenvalues is also less extreme , around @xmath103 rather than @xmath104 as before .",
    "these results suggest that when applying the design approach herein proposed , i.e. an asymmetric well with a phase shift - inducing feature , to real systems , tuning both parameters may be important to achieve high @xmath6 .",
    "we also performed eigenanalysis for the more general linear potential ; as a prototypical example for @xmath79 electrons the eigenvalues were @xmath105 indicating that only one parameter is important .",
    "interestingly , with increasing @xmath0 the lowest @xmath106 eigenvalues remained roughly constant while the largest eigenvalue strongly increased : for @xmath21 ; the principal eigenvalue was found to be @xmath107 , for @xmath108 it was @xmath109 and for @xmath110 it was @xmath111 .",
    "this progression is interesting because it suggests that for large @xmath0 , the problem in some sense becomes simpler as the important parameter dominates the others to an ever increasing extent .",
    "unfortunately , as with previous work@xcite , the eigenvectors are not clearly aligned with the parameter space , so the general linear potential provides less useful information than the highly constrained asymmetric @xmath32-function potential .",
    "we also display for each potential a visualization of the first few position matrix elements @xmath112 .",
    "these are important because , as discussed more fully in the appendix below , the hyperpolarizabilities can be expressed as a sum over states involving @xmath80 as well as the energy - level differences @xmath113 .",
    "it is therefore natural to examine this matrix to determine which transitions contribute most to the hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "the interpretation of this matrix is , however , complicated by the fact that many combinations of these parameters are individually irrelevant to the hyperpolarizabilities . as is well - known",
    ", for example , the three state model@xcite achieves the bounds quoted in equation ( [ eq : kuyzklimit ] ) , and only requires two parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 .    the @xmath80 matrices are dominated by the tridiagonal terms , and the diagonal elements can be eliminated from the expressions for the hyperpolarizabilities , e.g. by using the dipole - free sum over states ( dfsos ) formula . to aid inspection ,",
    "we have therefore omitted the diagonal terms and plotted the first off - diagonal terms , i.e. those with @xmath117 , in greyscale .",
    "the remaining terms are plotted in a scheme where intensity corresponds to magnitude and red or blue refers to the positive or negative sign of the term respectively . reflecting the potential in space and changing the signs of odd - indexed wavefuctions changes such plots only by changing the signs , and for @xmath118 the colors of @xmath80 for @xmath119 even . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we have chosen the potential or its mirror image in such a way that @xmath80 is positive for @xmath53 the homo and @xmath41 the lumo+1 .",
    "the off - tridiagonal terms are important to @xmath6 , because a tridiagonal matrix would yield @xmath120 as for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "clearly , however , for all the local optima displayed in table [ tab : beta ] , the @xmath121 terms are much larger than the remaining @xmath122 terms .    for each local maximum in table [",
    "tab : beta ] , we display calculated values of the @xmath66 and @xmath81 parameters .",
    "for the three state model , these parameters yield optimal @xmath123 for values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "however , past studies@xcite of optimized potential functions for @xmath22 electrons find values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 regardless of the starting potential .",
    "optimization of quantum graphs@xcite produces mildly different values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . for the optima presented here",
    ", we also find @xmath130 , but the results seem to favor a value of @xmath131 . this result is consistent with the results of eigenanalysis of the hessian , which suggests only one of the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath81 can be important .",
    "the dipole matrix plots , together with the value of @xmath81 or @xmath132 allows us to appreciate the compromises made in this optimization .",
    "all contributions to @xmath11 in the dipole - free sos formula involve three states , the product of the transition moments between them and a function of the energies . from the x - matrix plots it is clear that matrix elements become smaller very quickly moving away from the diagonal .",
    "thus the sos for @xmath11 is expected to be dominated by contributions from terms that involve only one off - tridiagonal element .",
    "there are exactly two sets of three states involving only the one off - tridiagonal matrix element : the ground state , the excited state in which one electron has been excited from the homo to the lumo and one of two doubly excited states : the state in which one electron has been excited from the homo to the lumo+1 or that in which one electron has been excited from the homo-1 to the lumo . as the homo to lumo+2 and homo-1 to lumo transition matrix elements have opposite signs , these contributions have opposite signs .",
    "generically the transition moments are larger between higher energy states to the homo to lumo+1 and so are expected not to dominate .",
    "the smaller result for many electrons seems , at least in part , to be explained by the negative contribution of the homo-1 to lumo contribution .",
    "this contribution is lacking for 1 or two electrons when there is no homo-1 .",
    "other than this , the pattern of matrix elements looks substantially similar for all the maximaincluding ones we have not displayed .",
    "thus it seems that the smaller results for @xmath6 for more than two electrons may be explained by the need to include four states rather than two , given the near degeneracy of the two doubly excited states .",

    "( [ eq : rescaling ] ) .",
    "this is particularly important because , if we generalize to the space of arbitrary potentials , there are many other solutions with identical values of the hyperpolarizability . for the @xmath22 case , we know that the hyperpolarizabilities can be completely reconstructed from the ground state wavefunction@xcite . extending this to the @xmath1 case , it is easy to see that the hyperpolarizablities can be constructed for this problem as appropriate integrals of the occupied single particle wavefunctions alone .",
    "as the largest term is expected to the homo , the important parameters ought to be expressible in terms of parameters crucial to the homo .",
    "moreover , there is a need to connect the dipole - free sum - over - states view , which prescribes certain values of the dipole transition matrix elements , and the potential view that we pursued above .",
    "we therefore performed an approximate analysis of the problem , inserting wkb ansatz wavefunctions into expressions for @xmath175 and @xmath80 to determine what details of these wavefunctions most significantly affect these parameters .",
    "the full calculations presented in the appendix below support this argument and suggest that the three parameters introduced in the next paragraph are the crucial ones ..    on the basis of approximate analytic arguments made in the appendix , and a numerical experiment that follows , we believe that there are three length scales that are important to the hyperpolarizabilities around the maximum .",
    "one is @xmath176 , the separation between the turning points of the homo .",
    "the other two are length scales @xmath177 for @xmath178 and an element of @xmath179 that characterizes the rate at which the wavefunction varies near the right and left turning points of the homo .",

    "as some of the definitions of @xmath185 are zero when @xmath186 is infinite at the turning points , and it is still possible for the hyperpolarizabilities to approach the maximum in this case , appropriate dimensionless combinations should not be infinite in this limit .",

    "the _ a posteriori _ consistency of these parameters supports the argument above that these are the `` real '' parameters of the optimization problem .",

    "the best values obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath7 drop from the @xmath22 case and approach an apparent feasible range of @xmath195 and @xmath141 for @xmath0 larger than around eight electrons .",
    "the asymmetric @xmath32-function potential achieves these bounds and , due to the small number of parameters , and _ a posteriori _ verification that the parameters are indeed relevant , provides a design prototype for synthesis of new chromophores . for @xmath6 , a molecule should have asymmetric walls and possess an attractive or repulsive feature in the middlea main chain functional group or side - chainthat promotes a rapid change in the phase of the wavefunction .",
    "the asymmetry of the boundary and the strength of the attraction or repulsion should then be tuned to achieve high @xmath6 . for @xmath7 , the molecule should be essentially @xmath36-symmetric with a central attractive or repulsive feature that should similarly be tuned .    by approximate analysis",
    ", we also determined that the _ ad hoc _ parameters of our potential can be re - expressed in terms of the dimensionless , scale invariant parameters derived from the shape of the homo wavefunction at the classical turning points .",
    "these new parameters are important both because they explain the success of our original parametrization and because they provide a new wavefunction - centered approach to screen potential chromophores for large hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "the results also provide important information on how well the many theoretical studies of single electron systems might describe real molecules that posses multiple electrons",
    ". while the apparent bounds quoted above are more restrictive than the @xmath22 case , it seems , encouragingly , that the overall design paradigms described above apply equally well to both cases .",
    "information from other studies on target values of the @xmath66 and @xmath81 parameters of the three state model for @xmath22 also seems to remain valid with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the insights of @xcite that only a very small number of parameters are required remain valid , and happily , this appears to be increasingly so with large @xmath0 . because of this and",
    "because the objective function for multiple electrons acquires many more local extrema , it should in principle be _ easier _ to tune multi - electron systems .",
    "in this appendix we use approximate techniques to argue that the dimensionless parameters identified in the main text constructed from the separation between the turning points of the homo and the slopes of the potential at these turning points ought to mostly explain the hyperpolarizability .",
    "the simple , zeroth order argument is given in the next two paragraphs . a more detailed but still very approximate calculation follows .    for all potentials with large hyperpolarizabilities ,",
    "the transition matrix elements between the frontier wavefunctionsthose that are close to the fermi levelmust be large .",
    "when these matrix elements are large , there are very strong constraints on the energy differences between the various states , and hence we can regard these parameters are fixed by the matrix elements and we need only calculate the transition matrix elements to predict the hyperpolarizabilities .    in order to calculate these transition matrix elements approximately , we note that wavefunctions fall rapidly in the classically forbidden region and oscillate in the classically allowed region .",
    "thus most of the transition matrix integral between two states necessarily comes from the region between or very close to the turning point of the lower energy state .",
    "moreover , far from the turning points , each wavefunction becomes relatively small , in effect because the particles are ( classically ) moving relatively quickly .",
    "thus most of the contribution to these integrals comes from the region close to the turning point of the lower energy wavefunction . from this",
    "it is clear that the distance between the turning points of the homo is an important parameter .",
    "the wavefunction near a turning point is constrained by the slope of the potential at the turning point . moreover , the ratio of the amplitudes of the wavefunction at the two turning points is limited by general principles , described below . while the wavefunction of the higher energy state near the turning points of the lower energy states is more free to vary , provided the potential is not too far from linear , they are still largely constrained by the slope of the potential .",
    "thus the slopes of the potential at the turning points of the homo also seems to be a very important parameter . from these parameters ,",
    "it is possible to construct two dimensionless parameters , and it is known from numerical experiments that only two parameters seem to be important to maximizing hyperpolarizabilities for model potentials .    we now provide a more detailed , but nonetheless approximate , analysis .",
    "we begin with the sum - over - states formulae for the hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "for instance , the off - resonant expression for the second hyperpolarizability is ,      which contains three kinds of quantity : the energy level differences @xmath113 , matrix elements @xmath112 and barred quantities @xmath197 that contain dipole terms , @xmath198 as is well known , the dipole terms can be eliminated from these expressions using the sum rules@xcite , leaving only the transition elements @xmath80 and energy level differences @xmath175 .",
    "numerous previous studies , as well as the results above , have shown that only a few statesin fact 2 - 3near the fermi energy contribute significantly to the hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "hence , the question of what is important to the hyperpolarizability maybe be addressed by understanding how the potential and wavefunctions affect these quantities . in the remainder of the appendix , we will answer this question by constructing wkb ansatz wavefunctions , inserting them into expressions for these quantities and examining the form of the results .    in order to proceed",
    ", we make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the true optimum potential is sufficiently smooth that the wkb approximation yields good approximations , at least near the turning points , to the relevant wavefunctions , i.e. those near the fermi surface .",
    "this is justified by previous studies@xcite that have shown the addition of small rapidly varying perturbations to the potential does nt affect the hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "the ansatz potentials studied in this work , with delta functions and changes in slope at isolated points , all satisfy this criterion .",
    "second , we shall assume that for wavefunctions near the fermi energy there are only two classical turning points , except possibly for isolated delta functions in the potential that may violate this rule .",
    "we justify this because the presence of multiple turning points would result , at least approximately , in roughly independent particles in the separate classically allowed regions .",
    "this would lead to hyperpolarizabilities that grow @xmath199 rather than @xmath200 ( for @xmath11 ) or @xmath201 ( for @xmath12 ) as the kuzyk bounds imply .",
    "the turning points shall be denoted @xmath202 and @xmath203 , corresponding to the left and right turning point respectively , and are found by solving @xmath204 . in this expression , and hereafter , @xmath154 indexes the left or right turning point .    within the above assumptions it is possible to write an ansatz wavefunction for the @xmath53th state that is valid except for the region near the classical turning points , @xmath205 , & e > v\\\\ a_{n}(x)\\exp\\left[-\\gamma_{n}^{l}(x)\\right ] , &",
    "e < v \\end{cases}\\label{eq : psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 and @xmath207 refer to the classically allowed and forbidden regions respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath208 are defined by , @xmath209 and the function @xmath210 is given by , @xmath211 the remaining functions @xmath212 and @xmath213 are smooth and slowly varying , except where the potential has delta functions or sharp changes ; nonetheless they are necessarily smoother than the potential . for the smooth potentials considered here",
    ", @xmath214 is of order @xmath102 or smaller .",
    "@xmath215 is relatively close to the semiclassical result @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the classical velocity and @xmath218 changes only by amounts that are asymptotically small where the wkb approximation is valid , except very close to the turning points .",
    "the dependence of @xmath218 can easily be made more precise by using the uniform asymptotic wkb approximation to the wavefunction@xcite though this does little to illuminate the discussion . moreover , even if wkb is invalid somewhere between the turning points , the magnitude , @xmath219 is , roughly speaking , the rate at which the electron turns at the turning point and so is expected to be the same at both turning points . in wkb",
    "there is no reflection in classically allowed regions and hence it is obvious that @xmath219 can not change .",
    "more generally , however , any structure between the turning points must have equal magnitude for the transmission and reflection from each side .",
    "this implies that @xmath219 must have the same values at both turning points .",
    "moreover , @xmath218 can be chosen to be real near both turning points , and the ratio of @xmath220 near the two turning points alternates sign as we increase the energy of the wavefunctions .",
    "@xmath227-\\delta x_{t , m}^{2}\\left[e_{m}-v(\\delta x_{m}y+x_{m}^{l}\\right]}{\\delta x_{n}\\left[e_{n}-v(\\delta x_{n}y+x_{n}^{l})\\right]+\\delta x_{t , m}\\left[e_{m}-v(\\delta x_{m}y+x_{m}^{l})\\right]}.\\label{eq : wkbnmfinal}\\ ] ]    the form of the integrand in ( [ eq : wkbnmfinal ] ) is instructive : near the turning points , i.e. as @xmath228 and @xmath229 , the numerator goes to zero linearly in @xmath230 while the denominator goes to zero as a square root ; the integrand therefore vanishes like @xmath231 near the turning points .",
    "hence , the majority contribution to this integral comes from the spatial region far from the classical turning points , particularly if the two energies are similar and the potential near the turning points is slowly varying .",
    "moreover , this integral tends to smooth out small , high frequency variations in the potential ; it follows that if @xmath232 is small , then @xmath233 is largely determined by the form of the potential far from the turning points .",
    "we now turn to the dipole matrix elements @xmath80 , which can be computed using the position formula , @xmath234 we shall restrict our analysis to small values of @xmath232 , because only these states contribute significantly to the hyperpolarizability . moreover , approximate analysis of these integrals is complicated for large @xmath232 because , while small , they are strongly dependent on the detailed analytic behavior of the potential and wavefunctions .      .",
    "this integral is then the integral of a function that has @xmath236 nodes , roughly evenly spaced through the interval , and has a somewhat ( algebraically ) larger magnitude near the turning points . from this formula , it is apparent that the transition matrix elements depend primarily on the nature of the wavefunctions near the classical turning points , i.e. separation between the two turning points and as well as the shape of the wavefunctions in their vicinity .",
    "as the shape of the wavefunctions are most dependent on the slopes of the potential at the turning points and there must be a connection between the energy differences and the transition matrix elements , this strongly argues that the separation between the turning points of the homo and the slopes of the potential at these turning points should be among the most important heuristic parameters that determine the hyperpolarizabilities .",

    "<S> in contrast to previous studies , analysis of the hessian matrices of @xmath6 and @xmath7 taken with respect to these parameters shows that the eigenvectors are well aligned with the basis vectors of the parameter space , indicating that the parametrization was well - chosen . </S>",
    "<S> the physical significance of the important parameters is also discussed . </S>"
