    "it is well known that the interaction of noise and nonlinearity attracts a lot of interest in nonequilibrium systems theory @xcite .",
    "most of articles , concerning above noise induced phenomena , relate to problems of external noise influence : noise induced transitions in zero - dimensional systems @xcite ; noise - induced phase transitions @xcite ; stochastic resonance @xcite ; noise sustained patterns @xcite , etc .",
    "analytically , numerically and in natural experiments it was found that an external noise plays an organizing role only if its amplitude depends on the field variable  multiplicative noise ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "if more than one noise source is introduced into the system dynamics , then the noise cross - correlations start to play a crucial role in ordering processes : a kind of phase transitions principally changes @xcite . from a fundamental viewpoint",
    "such effects has a dynamical origin : in a short - time limit external fluctuations destabilize a disordered homogeneous state .",
    "an analytic description of extended systems with external fluctuations is provided with an approximately known stationary distribution function .",
    "the possibility of noise induced patterns formation has been studied in last two decades ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting problem when the noise sustains patterns is widely discussed recently @xcite . in the most of works , concerning this problem , external fluctuations influence on the dynamics of systems",
    "is considered . recently",
    "a new mechanism for noise induced patterns formation was discovered .",
    "its origin is in a relaxational dynamics governed by the field - dependent mobility / kinetic coefficient @xcite .",
    "it was shown that corresponding self - organization processes are not related to a short - time instability of a homogeneous / disordered state . here",
    "the principle role is played by entropy variations caused by the field - dependent mobility @xcite .",
    "thus , an ordered behaviour appears due to the balance between relaxing forces moving the system to the homogeneous state , and fluctuations dependent on the field variable pulling the system away from the disordered state .",
    "this mechanism belongs to a kind of entropy driven phase transitions that is an extension of noise induced unimodal - bimodal transitions in zero - dimensional systems @xcite . in such systems",
    "a dissipation is related to fluctuations according the fluctuation dissipation relation .",
    "hence , one gets an internal multiplicative noise with intensity reduced to the bath temperature . for such class of stochastic systems the corresponding distribution function , free energy and associated effective potential",
    "are known exactly .",
    "therefore , coherent structures / patterns appeared in the course of self - organization processes can be analyzed without any dynamical reference .    in this paper",
    "we will study a behaviour of extended stochastic systems when the noise can induce or sustain spatial patterns according to entropy driven mechanism . to this end",
    "we consider a model of reaction - diffusion system of the field - dependent mobility with non - fickian diffusion and internal fluctuations of the multiplicative character .",
    "reaction - diffusion systems play an important role in the study of generic spatiotemporal behaviour of far from equilibrium systems .",
    "these models are usually applied to describe an extended systems when the physical space is divided in to the small cells and dynamics of each cell is described by a variable type of concentration .",
    "the model to be considered concerns the local dynamics of the variables inside each cell and the transport phenomena between cells .",
    "the local dynamics is determined by so - called chemical reactions inside each cell .",
    "the transport is caused by non - fickian diffusion .",
    "we will study stationary spatial inhomogeneities with lengths bigger than the linear dimensions of the cells in such system .",
    "formally , reaction - diffusion models are described by the equation for the field @xmath0 in the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for the local dynamics , @xmath3 is the flux for transport phenomena , @xmath4 . considering the non - fickian diffusion , we exploit a gradient of molecular interactions potential @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , where the spherically symmetric interaction potential @xmath7 between molecules separated by a distance @xmath8 is introduced ) . the corresponding force given by the gradient of @xmath5",
    "governs the transport phenomena . in the case of the small interaction radius compared to the diffusion length the concentration field @xmath9 will not vary significantly within the interaction radius .",
    "it allows to approximate the integral by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a correlation radius ) ; @xmath15 due to symmetrical properties of the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , the obtained flux allows to describe phase separation processes with mutual ( lateral ) interactions ; the combined model with local dynamics can be used to consider the spatial patterns induced by the fluctuations of the bath . with the help of such formalism",
    "one can find an explicit form of the stationary distribution functional and study spatial patterns using a variational principle .",
    "analytical results we verify by computer simulations .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in the section",
    "ii we introduce a general model for stochastic reaction - diffusion systems and present the theoretical approach is useful in our consideration . in section iii",

    "therefore , according to such relation the noise intensity @xmath35 addresses to an effective temperature of the bath , whereas @xmath45 plays a role of the effective entropy .",
