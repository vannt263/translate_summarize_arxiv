    "many biological processes depend on efficient transport on the microscopic scale .",
    "biological cells contain a large number of microscopic machines that are for example able to maintain the exchange of nutrients between the cell and the surrounding medium .",
    "another important issue is the transport of cargos between the cell center and the membrane  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "transport driven by molecular motors is of particular importance : molecular motors are specialized proteins that are able to perform a directed motion along actin filaments and microtubules , i.e. , filaments that are part of the cytoskeleton  @xcite .",
    "several aspects of motor driven biological transport have been modeled recently  @xcite with variants of the so - called asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite .",
    "the use of this type of models has been motivated since the molecular motors move stepwise ( hence the relevance of a model defined on a discrete lattice ) and interact via mutual exclusion .",
    "but in addition to this , molecular motors can attach and detach from the filament .",
    "this property of molecular motors led to extensions of the asep  @xcite which successfully describe the unidirectional motion of _ in vitro _",
    "motor assays @xcite .    in the case of bidirectional systems of molecular motors ,",
    "the theoretical understanding is so far incomplete .",
    "it has been shown that simple extensions of the unidirectional models are not able to describe efficient bidirectional transport if the filament is embedded in a small volume and the diffusivity of unbound particles is limited  @xcite .",
    "this situation could for example be relevant for motor - driven transport in axons .",
    "the question that naturally arises is the following : what are the minimal ingredients that must be added to the existing unidirectional models in order to describe bidirectional transport of stochastic interacting particles ?    in this article , we consider different kinds of particle - particle interactions which may lead to lane formation , i.e. , the self - organized separation of particles moving in opposite directions .",
    "this is in contrast to models for bidirectional transport with predefined lanes for each direction ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall discuss their ability to generate efficient bidirectional transport . a first mechanism which has formerly been proposed by klumpp and lipowsky  @xcite takes into account the experimentally observed preferential adsorption of motors to a filament if the neighboring site is occupied by a motor of the same type  @xcite . in  @xcite , they have observed lane formation above a critical value of the coupling parameter .",
    "we complete their results and present a more extensive study of the model .",
    "we show that the properties of the model depend strongly on the kind of diffusion reservoir that is considered around the filaments .",
    "in particular we have shown that lane formation is hindered if diffusion occurs in a confined environment .",
    "in a second part , as an alternative mechanism , we introduce particle - particle interactions that induce lane changes if oppositely moving particles are encountered .",
    "this mechanism does allow to have lane formation in a confined environment .",
    "eventually , we also consider that the filament itself can undergo some dynamical process , motivated by the experimentally observed continuous reorganization of the microtubule network .",
    "we shall consider a much simplified version of the filament dynamics , as this was done in  @xcite .",
    "there , we had shown that a dynamic lattice may enhance the transport efficiency of bidirectional stochastic transport . here , we shall study the influence of lattice dynamics in the presence of particle - particle interactions and show that both mechanisms can cooperate to obtain efficient transport .",
    "our work is organized as follows : after introducing some general definitions and summarizing some previously obtained results ( next section ) , we shall consider two types of interactions : first , we investigate the model introduced by klumpp and lipowsky  @xcite considering the preferential binding of particles ( section  [ sec : interact ] ) . in section  [ sec : sidestep ] , we discuss the effect of another type of interaction , namely a dynamic particle - particle interaction on the filament inducing lane changes . as mentioned above , for both types of interactions , we apply different kinds of particle reservoirs : we shall consider grand - canonical and canonical particle reservoirs and also the effect of a finite diffusivity of unbound particles .",
    "we shall also systematically discuss the impact of a dynamic lattice on lane formation and transport capacity of the systems . in the final section ,",
    "we compare the different approaches and discuss their relevance for axonal transport .",
    "the models which are discussed in this article are variants of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with two species of particles .",
    "the two species have opposite ` charges ' resulting in opposite moving directions on a one - dimensional lattice with regular spacing .",
    "the one - dimensional lattice represents the microtubule , or more precisely , one of the filaments that compose the microtubule , and thus it will be referred to as a filament in the remaining of the paper .",
    "particles hop with rate @xmath0 along the filament in the direction determined by their charge which we will refer to as positive or negative depending on the preferential moving direction ( see ) .",
    "we additionally consider attachment and detachment of particles to and from the lattice as first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "particles detach from the lattice with rate @xmath1 to a reservoir .",
    "the adsorption of a particle from the reservoir onto a site of the lattice occurs at rate @xmath2 .",
    "we examine different kinds of reservoirs which are specified below in the corresponding sections .",
    "they have in common that particles in the reservoir diffuse freely without any interactions between particles . on the filament ,",
    "all particles interact via hard - core exclusion and positional exchanges of oppositely charged particles are excluded in contrast to the model considered in  @xcite . a stepping or attachment move",
    "is therefore rejected if the target site is already occupied by another particle .    as standard set of parameters for the particle dynamics , we will use @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this choice of parameters corresponds to processive motion ( i.e. , motors are attached on the filament long enough so that directed motion contributes significantly to the overall motion ) , a basic feature of the molecular motors contributing to long - range transport , as conventional kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein  @xcite .",
    "as there are several parallel microtubules in axons , each of them made of several protofilaments , we could a priori consider a large number @xmath6 of parallel filaments .",
    "however , in order to keep the model simple , we shall consider only one filament except when the mechanism under study requires to have at least two filaments in parallel .",
    "particle densities are denoted by @xmath7 and defined as the number of particles divided by the system length .",
    "the index refers to the particle species .",
    "densities and particle numbers are therefore related through @xmath8 and we choose the total density to be equal to @xmath9 throughout the paper .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath7 can be greater than one as they take into account the total number of particles ( including those in the reservoir which is assumed to have an infinite capacity in this paper ) , divided by the _ number of filament sites_. the quantities @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote the densities of bound particles on the filament and @xmath13 , @xmath14 the densities of particles in the reservoir .     if the target site is empty .",
    "a particle detaches from the lattice at rate @xmath1 and adsorbs to unoccupied sites at rate @xmath2 . ]",
    "[ fig : basic_model ]      when motors detach from the microtubule , they undergo diffusive motion in the surrounding cytoplasm - a region of the cell that will be referred to as the _ reservoir_. depending on the geometry of the reservoir , the diffusive motion can have various characteristics .",
    "we shall define three types of reservoirs below .",
    "if the surroundings of the filament is an open space , motors can diffuse very far from the filament , and thus , most of the time , motors that attach to the filament have completely lost the memory of their previous detachment point .",
    "hence there is no need to keep track of spatial positions of the diffusing motors .",
    "actually , the grand - canonical reservoir will be modeled by a single number , representing the density of motors in the reservoir , which is assumed to be constant and ( in this paper ) equal to @xmath15 .",
    "attachment to empty sites on the filament occurs at rate @xmath16 .",
    "this type of reservoir is relevant if the filament is embedded in a large volume and the number of attached motors is small compared to the number of motors in solution .",
    "this is the case for many _ in vitro",
    "_ experiments .",
    "an infinite diffusion rate in the surroundings of the lattice is also considered in the canonical reservoir , and thus particles in the reservoir do not have any spatial coordinate and can attach to any empty site along the lattice .",
    "however , in the canonical setup , we consider that the total number of particles in the system is finite .",
    "this implies , with our definition of the density , that @xmath17 is fixed .",
    "again , attachment occurs at rate @xmath16 .",
    "this type of reservoir is relevant if the filament is embedded in a large volume and the number of motors attached to the filament is of the same order as the number of motors in solution .",
    "this situation can also be encountered in _ in vitro _",
    "experiments .",
    "actually , the axon is a rather crowded environment , where the size of the transported objects is of the same order as the distance between the microtubules @xcite , and the previous reservoirs are not relevant to model the diffusive motion episodes . in order to study the effects of confinement",
    ", we shall introduce a reservoir with a memory effect : there must be a correlation between the locations where a motor detaches , and where it attaches again on the microtubule .    in order to do so",
    ", the model is extended by a second lane which represents the reservoir ( see ) .",
    "particles in the reservoir symmetrically hop to both neighboring sites with rate @xmath18 without any interaction between particles .",
    "note that this one - dimensional reservoir actually represents a three - dimensional region around the microtubule , which allows for several particles at the same longitudinal position .",
    "only the longitudinal diffusion , along the microtubule , is modelled explicitly .",
    "the transversal dimensions of the three - dimensional diffusion reservoir , which are not represented explicitly , can be tuned by taking a larger or weaker effective attachment rate ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "the larger the diffusive region is ( in the direction transverse to the microtubule ) , the weaker the effective attachment rate is .",
    "thus , under strong confinement , diffusion in the transverse direction should be more limited , the attachment rate in the model will be larger , and the memory effect will increase .    . ]    [ fig : finitediff ]        in this paper , we shall also consider that the underlying lattice itself can evolve dynamically .",
    "we shall consider the same type of lattice dynamics as in  @xcite : a site of the lattice is randomly eliminated at rate @xmath19 and recreated at rate @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig : model_defdyn ] ) .",
    "the indices refer to the processes of microtubule de-/polymerization , although the dynamics we consider here have little in common with realistic dynamics and must rather be considered as a minimal model .",
    "a particle can not bind to an eliminated site and immediately detaches from the lattice if it steps onto an eliminated site or is bound to a site which is being eliminated .",
    "we fix the polymerization rate equal to @xmath21 in order to reduce the number of free parameters ( we saw indeed in  @xcite that transport features were more sensitive to @xmath19 than to @xmath20 ) .    , and restored afterwards with a rate @xmath22 .",
    "when a particle arrives on a site that has been suppressed , it goes in the diffusion reservoir ( upper lane ) . ]",
    "[ fig : model_defdyn ]",
    "it has been shown that bidirectional transport models in which the particle species interact only via an exclusion interaction generically exhibit macroscopic clustering at any finite density @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this large cluster controls the current in the system and therefore limits the total transport capacity .",
    "in particular , for large systems , the current vanishes .    considering the case of bidirectional transport on dynamical lattices , it has been shown that lattice dynamics can induce a transition from the clustered phase to a homogenous phase in which the particles are distributed over the whole system  @xcite .",
    "the homogenous states are density - dependent so that a finite ( non - vanishing ) current of particles is present even in very large systems , which would not be the case on a static lattice .",
    "the transition takes place because the lattice dynamics breaks up forming clusters and thus limits the reachable maximum cluster sizes . at a given strength of the lattice dynamics ,",
    "the nascent clusters are dissolved more quickly than they can form and the system appears homogenous .",
    "the transition depends mostly on the rate at which binding sites disappear suggesting that the finite lifetime of individual binding sites is crucial for the observed transition .    in order to support this point of view",
    ", it has been verified that this effect is not simply due to the cutting of the filament into several segments of different lengths , by considering a static lattice with the same density of individual holes . in that case , the phase transition is not observed , thus indicating that the cluster dissolution is really an effect of the dynamics of the lattice .",
    "though this scenario was inspired by the fact that microtubules are themselves evolving through the so - called dynamic instability , i.e. , events of polymerization and depolymerization , the dynamics of the filament as we have defined it in  @xcite or in section [ subsec : latticedyn_def ] do not aim at being realistic , but rather are the simplest kind of lattice dynamics that could be considered in order to illustrate the aforementioned mechanism .",
    "decoration experiments with kinesin on microtubules  @xcite showed that kinesins attach on the microtubule preferentially in the vicinity of similar motors .",
    "this motivates the assumption of a general attractive interaction between molecular motors of the same species .",
    "this experimental fact was first considered by klumpp and lipowsky  @xcite in a modification of the above - presented basic model by consideration of detachment and attachment rates that depend on the next neighbor in the stepping direction of the particle : if the next site in moving direction is occupied by a particle of the same species , the detachment rate is lowered by a factor @xmath23 whereas the attachment to that site is enhanced by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "if the next site is occupied by a particle of the opposite species , the detachment is enhanced by a factor @xmath24 and attachment is lowered by a factor @xmath23 ( see ) . in all other cases ,",
    "the rates remain unchanged . in the remaining , we shall call @xmath24 the strength of the interaction , as the modified attachment and detachment rates are supposed to be due to attractive / repulsive interactions between similar / different motor species .     if the next site is occupied by a particle of the same species . in the case of a particle of the opposite species ,",
    "detachment is enhanced and attachment is de - favored . ]",
    "[ fig : kl_interaction ]    we shall now study the consequences of having these modified attachment / detachment rates on the efficiency of transport , as an extension of the results presented in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , several types of reservoirs will be considered and shown to have a strong influence on transport properties .    in a first stage",

    "in particular ,",
    "the critical interaction strength @xmath25 above which lane formation occurs depends on the system size and increases for larger systems . in  @xcite , numerical evidence was given that @xmath25 has a finite value in the limit of infinite system sizes which is supported by the mean field treatment of the system in the same paper .",
    "however , one has to be cautious before claiming that there is true symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit . indeed , a subtlety has been exemplified in the case of another bidirectional transport model , the ahr model  @xcite , for which numerical evidence for a phase transition had been found .",
    "actually , a very careful analysis  @xcite of the ahr model has shown that the correlation length can grow up to @xmath39 , and then remain finite , so that there is no true symmetry breaking .",
    "so , although the data presented in  @xcite seem to be rather convincing , there might be a subtlety which can not be addressed by a numerical treatment .",
    "second , although the difference in current between the two species is very large above the transition , indicating that lane formation has occurred , the transition does not influence the total current of the system as it is continuous . for the choice of parameters considered here ,",
    "the maximum of the total current is actually located before the onset of lane separation .",
    "this can be seen by the sum of the currents ( black and red line in ( b ) ) which corresponds to the current of a single species in a system with two filaments , of which each is dominated by a different species .",
    "it is to note that the relative position of the onset of lane formation with respect to the maximum of the total current varies with the reservoir density such that the onset of lane formation might also occur for lower interaction strengths than the maximum in the current .",
    "the interesting feature is that , above the transition for high values of @xmath24 , the current actually decreases although the encounters of oppositely moving particles are less frequent .",
    "this decrease is instead caused by the filament being overcrowded , as can be seen in .",
    "the density on the filament is close to one and although all particles move in the same direction , most of the attempted steps are rejected because of the lack of vacancies .",
    "the stronger the interactions between particles , the more the situation worsens .",

    "note that for multilane unidirectional systems , strong correlations between the lanes were found , both for strong and weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "thus , simulating only one lane turns out to be representative for the whole system .",
    "this is in contrast to the bidirectional case considered here , for which lane formation may require to consider more than one filament .",

    "but as has already been reported in  @xcite , a dynamic lattice is capable of dramatically increasing the current along the lattice and reaching an efficient state by dissolving large clusters .",
    "this effect is obviously also present in this system and the strength of the additional interaction only has very little impact on the current on the dynamic lattice .",
    "the increase of current due to the modified attachment / detachment rates on the dynamic lattice is of the same order as the one observed on the static lattice ( figure  [ fig : fd_static : magnetization_current ] ) and represents only a small fraction of the increase due to lattice dynamics : in a system of density @xmath55 and length @xmath56 , the maximum current increase caused by the lattice dynamics is almost ten - fold , whereas the modified attachment / detachment rates do not even double the current in the system .          an overview of the results of this section with its multiple scenarios is shown in table  [ tab : kl_results ] with the color of the cell indicating if lane formation is possible .    in summary ,",
    "particle - particle interactions which modify the attachment and detachment rates of particles depending on the occupation of the neighboring sites can lead to lane formation for reservoirs with an infinite diffusion rate only . in this case , although the number of encounters of particles of different species is reduced , the throughput of particles is extremely low in systems with a _ large _ number of particles .",
    "this is due to overcrowding of the lattice caused by the strong attractive interactions in lane - separated systems .    on the other hand , we have observed that efficient transport through lane formation can be obtained if the total particle density is limited to _ low _ enough values . however , in order to be in this optimal regime , the interaction strength @xmath24 should be large enough .",
    "there is no direct experimental measurement of the interaction strength that would allow to decide whether real systems are in this efficient regime .",
    "crude estimates for @xmath24 can be made from the decoration experiments with kinesin , and would give @xmath57 @xcite or @xmath58 @xcite , thus values that would be too low to trigger lane formation .",
    "however , this is certainly not a definite statement , as the interaction terms could have a different form than the one of figure  [ fig : kl_interaction ] , and further experimental measurements ( in particular involving two types of motors ) should be performed to refine the prediction .",
    "it should be noted that due to the dynamics of microtubules in real systems , the interaction strength @xmath24 needed to obtain separated lanes may be shifted to higher values , as we have found that it is the case here for a much simplified lattice dynamics .",
    "more generally , the fact that the lane formation mechanism is dependent on an infinite diffusivity around the transport lattice is a major drawback for the relevance of this type of interaction for the axon , which is a rather crowded environment .",
    "thus , though an efficient regime was evidenced by our simulations for the canonical reservoir , we are not able to decide yet whether it is relevant for real systems , and thus it is worth to explore alternative scenarios ( as will be done in the next sections ) .    in the absence of the aforementioned particle - particle interaction ,",
    "the lattice dynamics was shown to improve the current along the filament for all three types of reservoirs . with the interaction presented here ,",
    "it has a positive effect whenever current is hindered by a ( possibly local ) high density .",
    "the lattice dynamics dominate the behavior of the system in the sense that the lane formation disappears for strong lattice dynamics whereas for strong particle - particle interactions , the effect of the lattice dynamics remains visible .",
    "the interaction presented in the previous section was able to induce lane formation and efficient transport only in the case of infinite diffusion in the reservoir .",
    "by contrast , in this section , we propose another type of particle interaction that is capable of inducing lane formation even for finite diffusion rates in the reservoir . as a consequence",
    ", only the reservoir with a finite diffusion rate will be treated here .",
    "particles obey to the same hopping rules as depicted in , i.e. , they hop into a preferential direction along the filaments and hop with equal rates in both directions in the reservoirs .",
    "in order to keep the model simple , we consider again only two filaments and the two associated reservoirs .",
    "exchanges between reservoirs or reservoir and filament occur with the same rates as before ( see fig .  [ fig:2lanemodel ] ) .",
    "the particles still interact via hard - core exclusion on the filament but instead of modifying attachment and detachment , we consider the following interaction between particles : if a particle s step along the filament is rejected because the target site is occupied by a particle of the opposite species , the particle switches to the other filament with probability @xmath59 provided the site at the same longitudinal position is empty on the other filament ( see ( a ) )",
    ". we shall refer to this interaction as the `` single obstacle '' interaction in the following .",
    "so far , there is no experimental data showing a similar behavior of molecular motors .",
    "however , the only known experiments on interactions between molecular motors are the decoration experiments for kinesins addressed in section  [ sec : interact ] which was shown to be rather questionable as a cause for possible lane formation . here",
    ", the idea is that opposed motors push against each other and thus could exert a force which might induce lane changes .",
    "this effect might be even more pronounced if one thinks of the relatively large cargos carried by the molecular motors .",
    "we shall also consider a variant of this interaction where the particle may only switch from one filament to the other with probability @xmath59 if it encounters _ two _ particles of the opposite species on the two next sites in stepping direction ( see ( b ) ) .",
    "this mechanism will be referred to as the `` two obstacles '' interaction .     if it encounters ( a ) one or ( b ) two particles of the other species .",

    "the reservoirs are not shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ fig : sidestepmodel ]        on a static lattice , changing lanes in front of a single particle of opposite species does not lead to dramatic effects . in particular ,",
    "no lane formation is observed although the absolute magnetization of the filament slightly increases .",
    "this effect competes with the reservoir exchange rate @xmath52 which tends to mix the system and destroys any phase separation between the two subsystems . at @xmath60 , no effect of the additional particle - particle interaction",
    "is visible at any probability @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a small effect for decoupled reservoirs at @xmath61 .",
    "the increase of the magnetization is stronger the fewer particles we have in the system , but even for densities as low as @xmath62 , the magnetization does not exceed @xmath63 .",
    "it is noteworthy that at the system size @xmath56 considered here , there is no important clustering at this low density . in a clustered system with higher particle density ,",
    "absolute increases in magnetization are almost negligible : for @xmath55 , the magnetization passes from @xmath64 at @xmath65 to @xmath66 at @xmath67 .    alike",
    ", the current does not improve much with this side - stepping interaction .",
    "the clustered systems remain clustered and exhibit a maximal gain of their current of @xmath68 while starting from an extremely low value being caused by the existence of the large cluster .",
    "if we consider a stronger condition for filament changes as shown in  ( b ) , lane formation is obtained much more easily compared to the single obstacle model ( ) and occurs at any density with decoupled reservoirs , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "the current of particles along each filament is consequently very high and close to the optimal value found in a one - species tasep .",
    "the interaction is asymmetric in the sense that a single particle changes the filament if opposed to two particles of opposite charge while the single particle can not induce any lane change on the two particles . as a consequence , a particle species",
    "which is only slightly dominant on one filament can push more and more particles from the minority species to the other filament .",
    "ultimately , complete lane formation is observed .    as discussed in the last section",
    ", the lane formation competes with the mixing through the reservoirs .",
    "if the reservoir coupling is increased , the magnetization is lowered at some point and lane formation disappears ( ( a ) ) .",
    "the onset of remixing the separated lanes occurs at lower couplings @xmath52 for higher densities as in these cases , more particles are continuously transported to reservoir belonging to the ` wrong ' filament . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the system is completely mixed at any density .    the current increases by one order of magnitude if lane formation occurs ( ( b ) ) and is very close to the optimal value in the one - species tasep .     and the total density @xmath55 .",

    "systems with lane formation show a close - to - optimal current which is one order of magnitude higher than in the mixed case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ fig : sidestep2_static : magnetization_current ]        if the possibility to perform filament changes is combined with lattice dynamics , the system s tendency toward lane formation is increased ( see ( a ) ) .",
    "a system of density @xmath69 reaches complete lane formation at @xmath70 .",
    "however , at this value of the depolymerization rate @xmath19 , the basic model without filament changes does not exhibit a large cluster anymore , but is in a homogenous state with very small structures , and thus has already improved transport properties only due to lattice dynamics .",
    "the enhanced lane formation can be understood in the following way : in order to form lanes , filament changes of particles are necessary which can only occur if particles of different species meet .",
    "consequently , more lane changes are induced if there are more interfaces between positive and negative particles . in a clustered system , almost all the particles",
    "are accumulated in the cluster so that there are only very few interfaces .",
    "the lattice dynamics , though , inhibits the formation of large clusters and instead distributes the particles more homogeneously over the whole system leading to many very small clusters .",
    "this effectively increases the number of interfaces between positive and negative particles and thus favors lane changes and lane formation .",
    "the effect which has been mentioned in that holes in the lattice decrease the effectivity of a particle - particle interaction because the interaction is only next - neighbor seems to be overcompensated by the increase in interfaces due to the dissolution of the big cluster .",
    "the strength of the lattice dynamics that is needed to form lanes depends on the particle density , e.g. , a system of density @xmath55 does not exhibit complete lane formation at any lattice dynamics ( see ( c ) ) while a system of density @xmath62 forms lanes at much lower lattice dynamics ( not shown ) .     with decoupled reservoirs @xmath61 , for a density ( a ,",

    "this impression is strengthened by the observation that similar gains due to the dynamic lattice are obtained even if no lane formation occurs ( ( d ) ) .",
    "the values of the current for @xmath55 are remarkable since they are rather close to the maximum current of @xmath73 that would be found in a one - species tasep , although encounters between particles of different species are still frequent in our model even at important lattice dynamics .",
    "these results have so far been obtained at decoupled reservoirs @xmath61 .",
    "the influence of the reservoir coupling @xmath52 is shown in for a dynamic lattice .",
    "already an extremely small reservoir coupling destroys the lane formation ( ( a ) ) .",
    "if diffusion in longitudinal and transverse direction are equal , i.e. , @xmath60 , the lane formation effect disappears almost completely .",
    "however , the current is only marginally affected ( ( b ) ) and reaches almost identical values for all reservoir couplings at @xmath67 .",
    "this once more confirms that the lattice dynamics is dominant in determining the transport capacity of the system .     at density @xmath69 .",
    "motors interact through the `` single obstacle '' interaction , and a dynamic lattice is considered with @xmath74 .",

    "the influence of the lattice dynamics and the competition with the reservoir coupling @xmath52 on the magnetization and therefore on the lane formation remains qualitatively unchanged compared to .",
    "there is nevertheless an interesting difference for the value of the current in the systems with lane formation : for the most dynamic lattices @xmath70 , the current in the separated system can sometimes be lower than in de - mixed or even mixed systems at lower lattice dynamics ( blue and green lines in ( b ) ) . in these cases ,",
    "the lattice dynamics actually inhibit any further improvement of the current by eliminating too many sites of the filament along which no transport can happen .",
    "this effect is the more pronounced , the lower the density of particles is .     at density @xmath75 , with `` two obstacle '' interactions as depicted in ( b ) , and reservoir coupling @xmath76 .",
    "the lattice dynamics enhance lane formation in only partially de - mixed systems and have an important impact on the current.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at density @xmath75 , with `` two obstacle '' interactions as depicted in ( b ) , and reservoir coupling @xmath76 .",
    "the lattice dynamics enhance lane formation in only partially de - mixed systems and have an important impact on the current.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ fig : sidestep2_dynamic : magnetization_current ]          the most important results of this section are summarized in table  [ tab : stericia_results ] .    the proposed interaction between particles which eventually induces filament changes of the particles has been shown to lead to lane formation under special conditions . in general , three factors determine the possibility of lane formation : 1 . a higher particle density @xmath10 decreases the tendency to form separate lanes for both species ( in contrast to what was observed for the modified attachment / detachment rates of section [ sec : interact ] ) .",
    "2 . the reservoir coupling @xmath52 suppresses lane formation by mixing partially phase - separated subsystems ( already true for the modified attachment / detachment rates of section [ sec : interact ] ) .",
    "this mixing is very efficient as the rates needed to inhibit lane formation are several orders of magnitude smaller than all the other rates in the system .",
    "3 . lattice dynamics promotes lane formation by increasing the number of contacts between positive and negative particles through a redistribution of the particles on several filament segments .",
    "we therefore have two effects leading to higher currents , one of which ( lattice dynamics ) improves the other ( lane formation ) .",
    "considering the current , lane - separated states can obviously be considered as efficient transport states .",
    "they have a high throughput of particles and because of the absence of large structures , no finite - size effects are present , so that we have a density - dependent state .",
    "this property is necessary to have finite current in very long systems .",
    "however , we have shown that the effect of lattice dynamics on the current has a much larger amplitude than the one due to the side stepping mechanism .",
    "in the present article , we presented two different types of particle - particle interactions in a quasi one - dimensional lattice gas with oppositely moving particle species .",
    "both types of interactions lead to lane formation under certain conditions .",
    "we explored the robustness of these lane - separated states and their transport capacity .",
    "an efficient transport state was supposed to be characterized by a system size - independent (= density - dependent ) state , with a finite current that compares to the current in a one - species tasep serving as a benchmark .",
    "the first type of interaction which was considered by klumpp and lipowsky  @xcite affects the affinity to the filament in the vicinity of other particles .",
    "the lane - separated states that are found ( only for infinite reservoir diffusion ) exhibit a density - dependent current but many of these states also have extremely high densities on the filament so that the actual current of bound particles is rather low compared to an optimal regime .",
    "this is in particular the case for open systems ( grand - canonical reservoir ) , or for closed systems with high enough densities ( canonical reservoir ) .",
    "the conclusion is that lane formation does not necessarily imply efficient transport although this can be the case .",
    "lower densities with a canonical reservoir do lead to very efficient states which compare well to the one - species tasep .",
    "lane formation with this type of interaction ( leading to modified attachment / detachment rates ) was only possible for an infinite diffusion rate in the reservoir .",
    "with regard to an application of these concepts to real transport processes as intracellular transport , this is a very strong assumption .",
    "the interior of a cell is very crowded and considering the typical sizes of vesicles and organelles , diffusion should be very limited . in the case of finite diffusion ,",
    "no lane formation is observed and the interaction plays a minor role in improving the current , compared to the much more positive impact of lattice dynamics .    in the second type of interaction that has been considered in this paper , particles hop to the neighboring filament when they meet an oppositely charged motor .",
    "although this model is in principle able to exhibit lane formation at finite longitudinal diffusion , the lane - separated state is extremely sensitive to diffusion between reservoirs , i.e. , diffusion in the transverse direction .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the first interaction model which actually needed infinite diffusion rates to exhibit lane formation .",
    "the difference comes from the nature of the particle - particle interaction .",
    "any de - mixing in the first scenario has to be carried out via particle exchanges with the reservoir whereas in the second scenario , particles directly switch from one filament to the other and do not need the reservoir to form lanes . from a biological point of view , the strong limitation of transversal diffusion required for the scenario based on side - stepping could be realized if the axon is compartmentalized such that diffusing particles can not reach easily other filaments than the ones in their direct neighborhood .",
    "furthermore , based on the experimental observation that microtubule - based transport in axons takes place on dynamic microtubules , we have considered that the underlying lattice itself can undergo some dynamics , through the much simplified random polymerization / depolymerization of filament units .",
    "as , from a general point of view , the consequences of a lattice dynamics on transport properties are not known , we chose to concentrate on a simplified lattice dynamics , to study generic effects , rather than going directly into the full complexity of the biological system .    we had already shown in @xcite how such a lattice dynamics can drive the system from a size - dependent state with inefficient transport , to a density - dependent state with efficient transport . in the present paper , we have studied again what would be the influence of a dynamic lattice on the transport efficiency , but now in the presence of interactions . in almost all cases ( i.e. , for almost all types of reservoirs and particle interactions ) , we found that lattice dynamics improves the efficiency of transport . actually , we found only one case in which the lattice dynamics does not improve the current in the system : if the system forms lanes at low enough density @xmath10 , with infinite diffusion rate in the reservoir , then lattice dynamics worsens a state which is already close to optimal transport .",
    "however , an infinite diffusion rate in the reservoir is not expected to be relevant for transport in real cells , and besides , there is no experimental evidence yet that the motor - motor interaction strength is sufficient to reach this state . in all the other cases ,",
    "the benefits from lattice dynamics as described in  @xcite were still valid also when combined with particle - particle interactions .",
    "more precisely , the lattice dynamics modifies the lane formation mechanism for both types of interaction scenarios . in the first scenario , while lane formation is shifted to stronger interactions , lattice dynamics still improve the transport in the system by lowering the density on the filament in the inefficiently crowded states .",
    "the second lane formation mechanism through side - stepping is enhanced by the lattice dynamics as it relies on direct contacts between particles of opposite species which are increased by the dissolution of clusters .",
    "then lattice dynamics on the one hand lowers the interaction strength required to form lanes , and on the other hand improves the current in lane separated states .    for both types of interactions ,",
    "the same effects are already present on a static lattice with a sufficient density of holes , due to an effective limitation of the system size .",
    "but our results indicate that the effects are enhanced when the lattice undergoes some dynamics ( at equal hole density ) .    in total",
    ", lane formation appears difficult to achieve in bidirectional systems as considered here , because the fact that the run length along the filament is finite ( due to processivity or lattice dynamics ) actively works against any sorting of particles onto different filaments .",
    "lane formation can be achieved only for special combinations of parameters or characteristics of the system .",
    "it is an open question to know whether biological parameters for axonal transport are or are not in this regime .",
    "several types of molecular motors which participate in intracellular transport have been studied experimentally , but results are obtained mostly for _ in vitro _ experiments , while it is not obvious that dynamical parameters are the same in an in vivo environment . besides , some motors ( as dyneins ) are more difficult to study , and we are lacking data .",
    "there are almost no experimental results about interactions between different types of motors .",
    "it can not be excluded that other interactions between motors than those considered here lead to lane formation mechanisms which are less sensitive to system parameters .",
    "there is an urgent need for more data on particle - particle interactions which could possibly be acquired by statistical exploitation of _ in vitro",
    "_ experiments involving many motors .",
    "as mentioned above , the lattice dynamics were intentionally kept simple in this paper .",
    "we found that such lattice dynamics produce transport enhancement through cluster dissolution , and in @xcite , we found that it was robust for several types of simple lattice dynamics .",
    "still , in further studies , we plan to apply our approach to more biologically relevant dynamics , but there is still a need of experimental observations about the precise dynamics of the microtubule network .",
    "anyhow , for the interactions considered in this paper , we found that for finite diffusion the lattice dynamics always has a positive effect on transport , whether lane formation is present or not .",
    "thus in the context of axonal transport , lattice dynamics and motor - motor interactions should not be considered as competing mechanisms , but rather as two complementary processes that can contribute in a cooperative way to the efficiency of bidirectional transport .",
    "only further experimental informations can allow to quantify the contribution of the various ingredients .",
    "however , in view of our results , we suggest that the microtubule dynamics could play an important role in the regulation of bidirectional transport , whether in combination with motor - motor interactions or not .",
