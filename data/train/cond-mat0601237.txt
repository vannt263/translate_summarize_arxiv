    "one of the most distinctive features of quantum phases of matter is that they are not completely characterized by their pattern of symmetry breaking ( order parameters of some kind ) , which is in a sharp contrast to classical statistical systems . instead",
    ", quantum ground states should be described by their pattern of entanglement such as topological or quantum order .",
    "@xcite however , beyond some simple textbook examples , e.g. , a system of two coupled @xmath2 spins ( qubits ) , we do not have many intuitions about quantum entanglement hidden in many - body wave functions . in a recent couple of years , the entropy of entanglement ( von neumann entropy )",
    "@xcite @xmath3 has been used to measure how closely entangled ( or how `` quantum '' ) a given ground state wave function @xmath4 is . here ,",
    "the total system is divided into two subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the reduced density matrix for the subsystem @xmath5 obtained by taking a partial trace over the subsystem @xmath6 of the total density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity is zero for classical product states whereas it takes a non - trivial value for valence - bond solid states ( vbs ) , or resonating valence bond states ( rvb ) of quantum spin systems , say .",
    "recently , the entanglement entropy at and close to quantum phase transitions in low - dimensional strongly correlated systems has been used as a new tool to investigate the nature of quantum criticality . @xcite even though one can tell different quantum phases from the scaling of the entanglement entropy , it is still not completely understood what kind of information we can distill from the von neumann entropy , other than that contained in conventional correlation functions .    on the other hand ,",
    "a phase degree of freedom is also a specific feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , berry phases @xcite associated with ( many - body ) wave functions in solid states are related to several interesting quantum phenomena which have no classical analogue .",
    "probably , it is best epitomized by the thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - nijs ( tknn ) formula in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite , in which gapped quantum phases are distinguished by an integral topological invariant originating from winding of the phase of wave functions .",
    "in addition to the iqhe , the berry phase also appears in the king - smith - vanderbilt ( ksv ) formula @xcite of the theory of macroscopic polarization , and its incarnation in quantum spin chains @xcite , and so on .",
    "an observable consequence of the non - trivial berry phase is the existence of localized states at the boundaries when we terminate a system with boundaries .",
    "@xcite    it is then tempting to ask if there is , if any , a connection between these two paradigms in quantum physics , namely , entanglement and the berry phase . in this paper",
    ", we discuss this issue by taking a family of translational invariant lattice free fermion systems in @xmath9 dimensions as an example .",
    "we bipartition the system into two subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath6 by introducing @xmath10-dimensional flat interfaces . within this setup",
    ", we can reduce the calculation of the entropy to that in a one - dimensional system by the @xmath10-dimensional fourier transform along the interface .",
    "we assume the existence of a finite energy gap @xmath11 above ground states which is inversely proportional to the correlation length , @xmath12 ( when measured in the unit of the band width ) .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we consider the case in which there are only two bands that are separated by a gap .    in this paper , we consider the berry phase associated with a response of a quantum ground state to a continuous twist of the boundary condition . for the case of free lattice fermion systems , for which a ground state is given by a filled fermi - dirac sea , this berry phase is a phase acquired by an adiabatic transport of the bloch wave functions in the momentum space and also called zak s phase.@xcite physically , it is related to macroscopic polarization of the fermi - dirac sea .",
    "@xcite a beauty of the simple two - band example that we discuss is that the berry phase for the quantum ground state can be easily computed and visualized , following the pioneering work by berry @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : 1d two - band systems ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch_sphere ] below . )    with these setups , we will demonstrate that taking the partial trace over a subsystem corresponds to creating boundaries in a system .",
    "two contributions to the entanglement entropy will be then identified .",
    "the first one is of type already discussed in a flurry of recent works focusing on detection of quantum critical points .",
    "this contribution to the entanglement entropy is largely controlled by the correlation length @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in one - dimensional ( 1d ) many - body systems close to criticality the entanglement entropy obeys a logarithmic law @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the central charge of the conformal field theory that governs the criticality , @xmath16 the lattice constant , and @xmath17 is the the number of boundary points of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the second contribution to the entropy comes from the localized boundary states of the correlation matrix that exist when the berry phase of the ground state wave function is non - vanishing .",
    "especially , when the berry phase is equal to @xmath18 and when the ground state respects discrete symmetries of some sort , the localized boundary states are topologically protected as discussed in refs .  @xcite . for this case , we will show that the contribution from the boundary states to the von neumann entropy is @xmath1 per boundary , i.e. , the same amount of entropy carried by maximally entangled pair of two qubits .",
    "we will also illustrate , by taking a specific limit , that when @xmath19 , the von neumann entropy from the boundary states is that of partially entangled qubits .",
    "we also discuss that the @xmath1 contribution to the von neumann entropy is related to vanishing of the expectation value of a certain non - local operator which creates a kink in 1d systems .",
    "this connection between the entanglement entropy and the kink operator is , in flavor , similar to discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the entanglement entropy is expressed as the expectation values of twist operators in conformal field theories .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : 1d two - band systems ] , we start our discussions with 1d translational invariant hamiltonians with two bands separated by a finite gap .",
    "the berry phase is introduced as an expectation value of a specific non - local operator that twists the phase of wavefunctions .",
    "we then discuss its connection to the entanglement entropy by making use of the correlation matrix .",
    "the calculation of the entanglement entropy is , in general , a rather difficult task at least analytically .",
    "furthermore , the berry phase contribution to the entropy might not be of perturbative nature .",
    "we thus consider two limiting situations . in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : limit 1 ] , we take the limit of the small correlation length @xmath20 and zero band width . in this specific limit , we can express the entanglement entropy as a function of the berry phase @xmath21 .",
    "we next focus on cases with a discrete unitary particle - hole symmetry ( chiral symmetry ) in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : limit 2 ] . except for requiring the chiral symmetry , any parameters of the hamiltonian ( the band structure ) can be arbitrary .",
    "once we impose the chiral symmetry , the berry phase @xmath21 can take only discrete values , integral multiple of @xmath22 .",
