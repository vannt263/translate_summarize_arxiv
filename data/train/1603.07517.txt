    "in this work , we are interested in quantum resonances , that is poles of the resolvent meromorphically extended through the real axis of self - adjoint operators @xmath0 . mostly , we consider the semiclassical schrdinger operator @xmath1 on @xmath2 for potentials @xmath3 decaying at infinity , but the discussion often applies to more general pseudodifferential operators provided they are close enough to the laplace operator @xmath4 out of a compact set .    in physics ,",
    "the notion of quantum resonances goes back to the very beginnings of quantum mechanics ( see e.g. gamow @xcite ) .",
    "it was proposed to explain results in scattering experiments , and it is associated to the notion of pseudo - particles with finite lifetime . to some extent ,",
    "it is reasonable to think of resonances as complex numbers which are generalized eigenvalues of quantum observable .",
    "the imaginary part of a resonance is interpreted as the inverse of the lifetime of the pseudo - particle it is associated to .",
    "thus , the closer they are to the real axis , the more meaningful they should be .",
    "we consider here resonances that are close to the real axis , namely with imaginary part of size @xmath5 , in the semiclassical regime @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that they are related to the existence of bounded classical trajectories for the hamiltonian vector field @xmath7 on @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 denotes the classical observable corresponding to , or the symbol of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "the set @xmath10 of bounded trajectories in @xmath11 is usually called the _ trapped set _ at energy @xmath12 . for example , it has been proved by martinez @xcite in the @xmath13 setting that for a given real @xmath14 such that the trapped set at energy @xmath14 is empty , there are no resonance is any complex disk of size @xmath15 around @xmath14 ( see also vanberg @xcite in the classical case ) .    as far as the asymptotic of resonances is concerned , trapped sets of different kinds , yet relatively simple ,",
    "have been considered .",
    "first of all , helffer and sjstrand @xcite have studied the so - called `` well in the island '' situation , where the potential @xmath3 have the shape of a well at energy @xmath14 .",
    "they have proved that the resonances near @xmath14 are exponentially close to the eigenvalues of a corresponding confining configuration , for example a suitable dirichlet realization @xmath16 of the differential operator @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , their imaginary part is exponentially small .",
    "moreover , in the case of a punctual well , that is when @xmath3 has a non - degenerate local minimum with critical value @xmath14 , they have given the asymptotic with respect to @xmath17 of the imaginary part of these resonances .",
    "when the potential @xmath3 has a general non - degenerate critical point with critical value @xmath14 , sjstrand @xcite has obtained the asymptotic of the resonances close to @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "in the case of a maximum , they satisfy @xmath18 for some @xmath19 . here , the @xmath20 s are the positive eigenvalues of the linearized hamiltonian vector field @xmath7 at the critical point .",
    "this result has also been proved by briet , combes and duclos @xcite ( see @xcite in dimension @xmath21 ) .",
    "the interested reader may find in @xcite a precise description of the spectral projection associated to these resonances .",
    "then , grard and sjstrand @xcite have studied the case where the trapped set at energy @xmath22 consists of a single closed orbit of hyperbolic type .",
    "they exhibit a bohr  sommerfeld like quantization rule along the orbit , and show that there is a bijection between the set of resonances and the set of roots of the quantization rule . up to lower order terms , the resonances in that case form a lattice at distance @xmath17 of the real axis .",
    "let us mention that resonances for hyperbolic situations have also been studied in slightly different contexts .",
    "they have been first investigated by ikawa @xcite and grard @xcite in the case of scattering by obstacles .",
    "there is also a wide related literature in general relativity ( see e.g. s barreto and zworski @xcite ) as well as for hyperbolic surfaces ( see e.g. dyatlov , faure and guillarmou @xcite ) . for weaker trappings",
    ", we would like to mention the results by burq @xcite for resonances generated by a corner and by alexandrova and tamura @xcite in the context of aharonov ",
    "bohm effect .",
    "@xmath23    here , we consider homoclinic situations .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the trapped set at energy @xmath14 consists of a hyperbolic fixed point , say @xmath24 , and homoclinic trajectories .",
    "we recall that a non - constant integral curve of a vector field is called homoclinic when it converges to a fixed point of the vector field as the time tends to both @xmath25",
    ". some configurations of this kind have already been studied in dimension @xmath21 by the second and third authors @xcite , and by servat @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the incoming / outgoing lagrangian manifolds associated to the fixed point @xmath27 .",
    "the homoclinic set is then @xmath28 .",
    "we also denote @xmath29 the positive eigenvalues of the linearization of the hamiltonian vector field at @xmath27 .",
    "we first obtain resonance free domains under fairly general assumptions . besides their intrinsic interest",
    ", these results should be seen as a preamble to the asymptotic of the resonances .",
    "the domains depend on the @xmath20 s and on the nature of the contact between @xmath30 and @xmath31 along @xmath32 .",
    "this last notion is more relevant than the dimension of the homoclinic set , as can be seen comparing previous results for other kinds of trappings .",
    "we distinguish between two cases , the precise corresponding results being stated in section [ s22 ] .",
    "note that , if we do not add any hypothesis , there may exist resonances exponentially close to the real axis .",
    "we assume first that the hyperbolic fixed point is anisotropic ( i.e. @xmath33 ) or that @xmath30 and @xmath31 intersect transversally in at least one direction . in the last case ,",
    "the dimension of @xmath32 is at most @xmath34 . in this weak trapping situation",
    ", we show that @xmath0 has no resonance and that its truncated resolvent has a polynomial estimate in a neighborhood of size @xmath17 of the real axis .",
    "such results have already been obtained for hyperbolic trapping ( see e.g. ikawa @xcite , nonnenmacher and zworski @xcite or petkov and stoyanov @xcite ) .",
    "second , we suppose that the @xmath35 dimensional measure of @xmath32 is not too large . in this situation which allows strong trappings , we show that @xmath0 has no resonance and that its truncated resolvent has a polynomial estimate in a neighborhood of size @xmath36 of the real axis .",
    "a single homoclinic trajectory in dimension @xmath21 enters into this setting .",
    "we then give in section [ s6 ] the asymptotic of the resonances in the most natural weak trapping situation : we suppose that @xmath32 consists of @xmath37 trajectories along which @xmath30 and @xmath31 intersect transversally .",
    "we form a @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 , depending only on dynamical quantities along @xmath32 and near @xmath27 , which mixes the contributions of the different homoclinic trajectories . in this case , the _ quantization rule _ reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for spectrum of . writing this in terms of",
    "the determinant leads to a scalar equation , whose solutions are called _ pseudo - resonances_. the first main theorem of the paper states that the resonances are close to the pseudo - resonances .",
    "notice that the quantization rule is not necessarily exact .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath42 in the region @xmath43 for any @xmath44 . combining with",
    ", the asymptotic of the resonances @xmath45 satisfying @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the @xmath49 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath51 s are continuous functions of @xmath52 .",
    "we also obtain a polynomial estimate of the distorted resolvent at distance @xmath36 from the resonances . comparing with",
    ", we notice that the resonances are closer to the real axis here than for the barrier - top alone and that there are way more resonances ( typically at least @xmath53 in domains of size @xmath17 ) .",

    ", they concentrate on continuous _ accumulation curves _ given by @xmath54 for @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the natural macroscopic parameter .",
    "since some of the @xmath49 s can vanish , there may be less than @xmath37 of these curves in the region .",
    "on the other hand , at the microscopic scale @xmath36 , the resonances are regularly distributed on horizontal lines .",
    "this particular distribution of the resonances has been observed in other settings by physicists and quantum chemists ( see e.g. korsch @xcite or burghardt and gaspard @xcite ) and in numerical computations ( see e.g. barkhofen , faure and weich @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , these accumulation curves enjoy remarkable properties that we study in section [ s18 ] .",
    "first , they are quasi - periodical functions of @xmath57 .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ vibration _ in the sequel .",
    "we also describe their asymptotic behavior as @xmath58 and show that they are related to the nature of the trapping for the energies above and below @xmath14 .",

    "eventually , we prove that is _",

    "eventually , we obtain the repartition of the resonances when @xmath30 and @xmath31 have a tangential intersection of finite order along a finite number of trajectories .",

    "we allow for a finite number of hyperbolic fixed points and of transversal homoclinic / heteroclinic trajectories between them .",
    "in this situation , we see the trapped set as a graph where the vertices are the fixed points and the edges are the homoclinic / heteroclinic trajectories .",

    "no regularity hypothesis ( except compactness which always holds ) is made on the set @xmath75 , which can be a cantor set for instance .",
    "lastly , one can formally recover from , taking @xmath32 small .    finally , we give the asymptotic of the _ resonant states _ in section [ s32 ] .",
    "these results are stated for a finite number of transversal homoclinic / heteroclinic trajectories .",
    "we prove that the resonant states are lagrangian distributions near each point of the homoclinic / heteroclinic trajectories .",
    "moreover , they are naturally associated to the eigenvectors of the quantization operator @xmath69 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath21 ( see and ) .",
    "we also give some examples showing that these functions can be unexpectedly distributed .",
    "for instance , we sometimes observe the _ delocalization _ of the resonants states . by this , we mean that the resonances are generated by a part of the trapped set ( i.e. the dynamical quantities appearing in the asymptotic of the resonances are localized near this part ) , whereas the corresponding resonant states are small near this part and large near another part of the trapped set .",
    "@xmath23    [ s36 ]    let us now describe the approach we use throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath81 be a closed operator on some banach space @xmath82 having only discrete spectrum near @xmath83 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath81 has an eigenvalue close to @xmath84 .",

    "@xmath92 second , we show that @xmath81 has at least one eigenvalue in @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . to this aim , we construct a test vector @xmath95 and we consider @xmath96 for @xmath97 . since @xmath98 ,",
    "the resolvent estimate yields that @xmath99 is well - defined , holomorphic and bounded by @xmath100 on @xmath101 .",
    "then we prove that @xmath102 for a well chosen @xmath103 .",
    "this is generally done computing first @xmath99 , the solution of @xmath104 .",

    ", the two previous points imply that = 0.05 in @xmath107 in @xmath108 ( in the sense definition [ g80 ] ) , and that the resolvent of @xmath81 has an nice upper bound in @xmath109 .",
    "note that to get an eigenvalue free domain , it is enough to prove the point @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , to carry out @xmath92 , the first point must already have been verified . eventually , to refine the asymptotic of the spectrum , it is enough to refine @xmath85 ( i.e. to take @xmath110 smaller ) .",
    "this approach is not specific to the study of the eigenvalues of an operator .",
    "it can be used to give the asymptotic of the characteristic values of holomorphic operator - valued functions ( see e.g. gohberg and leiterer @xcite ) .    for the study of the semiclassical resonances , we take @xmath111 , the distorted operator of angle @xmath112 defined in section [ s2 ] . for the type of problem considered in this paper ,",
    "it is natural to work with operators which are @xmath13 everywhere and analytic only at infinity ( in order to define the resonances ) .",
    "thus , we will use the @xmath13 semiclassical microlocal calculus .",
    "it means that the remainder terms will be of order @xmath63 ( and not of order @xmath113 as in the analytic category ) . the same way",
    ", it is natural to consider @xmath114 in .",
    "this choice is also based on the belief that the resolvent of @xmath115 can not behave worse than @xmath116 away from the resonances ( there is no pseudo - spectrum ) .",
    "then , leads to equations of the form @xmath117 with @xmath118 , whereas writes @xmath119 note that guaranties that the unique solution @xmath120 of satisfies @xmath121 , which allows us to apply the @xmath13 microlocal analysis .    using the ellipticity of @xmath115 at infinity ,",
    "this type of equations can be reduced to some microlocal cauchy problems near the trapped set : @xmath122 the problem is said to be homogeneous when @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is called the initial data .",
    "these microlocal cauchy problems must be seen as usual evolution equations .",
    "but the propagation must be understood in the spirit of hrmander and not using the time evolution @xmath125 .",
    "the intuition is that @xmath45 is a resonance if and only if there is no uniqueness in the microlocal cauchy problem .",
    "this idea exists in the folklore of the theory of resonances .",
    "more precisely , we show in section [ s3 ] that the uniqueness in a quantitative sense in implies that has no solution and then that @xmath45 is not a resonance from @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "we give the asymptotic of the solution ( existence ) of the microlocal cauchy problem in order to compute the solution of and realize @xmath92 .",
    "remark that it is generally enough to be able to solve the homogeneous problem .",
    "it means that one may take @xmath103 microlocalized outside the ( problematic part of the ) trapped set .",
    "most of the previous arguments hold in the general setting of semiclassical resonances . to the contrary ,",
    "the way we solve is specific to the geometry treated here .",
    "the idea is to decompose into small microlocal cauchy problems near the hyperbolic fixed points or along the homoclinic / heteroclinic trajectories .",
    "for the first ones , we use our previous work @xcite .",
    "for the second ones , we apply the usual propagation of singularities of hrmander . to achieve this decomposition ,",
    "the microlocal cauchy problem near the fixed points must be well posed .",
    "this is why we require that @xmath45 avoids some discrete set @xmath126 .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is the flexibility .",
    "we do not need to understand precisely what happens at @xmath84 , since it is enough to work at respectable distance .",
    "thus , it is possible to consider complicated geometries such as trappings with different types of trajectories , to concentrate the study near the to pertinent part of the trapped set , to treat crossings of resonances , @xmath127 in particular , the quantization rules of this paper approximate the resonances only in very specific regions of @xmath128 . by comparison with the grushin method ( see e.g. helffer and sjstrand @xcite ) , we do not have to construct quasimodes nor to inverse the so called grushin problem .",
    "instead , we only have to solve the microlocal cauchy problem for one data @xmath129 of our choice .",
    "moreover , we only have to show that @xmath130 in .",
    "furthermore , using the standard propagation of singularities instead of conjugating the operator @xmath0 near the trapped set allows to consider easily @xmath13 operators instead of analytic ones . of course , it is possible to achieved the grushin approach in the @xmath13 category ( see e.g. the work of lahmar - benbernou , martinez and the second author @xcite ) , as it is possible to work in the analytic category with our method .",
    "this strategy also provides polynomial estimates of the cut - off resolvent and the asymptotic of the resonant states on the base space . on the other hand ,",
    "the main weakness of our approach is that we only give the asymptotic of the resonances as a set . in other words",
    ", we have no upper bound on the multiplicity .",
    "if we were able to solve the general inhomogeneous microlocal cauchy problem , it might be possible to overcome this difficulty .",
    "lastly , the grushin method also provides a formula for the resolvent even near the spectrum that we do not have obtained here .    for the reader s convenience , we provide at the end of the paper an index of notations and the table of contents .",
