    "single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in hard reactions have a long history dating back to the 1970s when significant polarizations of @xmath0-hyperons in collisions of unpolarized hadrons were observed @xcite , and to the early 1990s when large asymmetries in @xmath1 or @xmath2 were found at fnal @xcite .",
    "no fully consistent and satisfactory unifying approach to the theoretical description of these observations has been found so far  see the reviews @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the most recently observed ssa phenomena , namely those in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) seem better under control .",
    "this is in particular the case for the transverse target ssa observed at hermes and compass @xcite . on the basis of a generalized factorization approach in which transverse parton momenta are taken into account @xcite these `` leading twist '' asymmetries can be explained @xcite in terms of the sivers @xcite or collins effect @xcite .",
    "the former describes , loosely speaking , the distribution of unpolarized partons in a transversely polarized proton , the latter describes the fragmentation of transversely polarized partons into unpolarized hadrons . in the transverse target",
    "ssa these effects can be distinguished by the different azimuthal angle distribution of the produced hadrons : sivers effect @xmath3 , while collins effect @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote respectively the azimuthal angles of the produced hadron and the target polarization vector with respect to the axis defined by the hard virtual photon @xcite .",
    "both effects have been subject to intensive phenomenological studies in hadron - hadron - collisions @xcite and in sidis @xcite . for the longitudinal target ssa in sidis , which were observed first but",
    "are dominated by subleading - twist effects , the situation is less clear and their description ( _ presuming _ that factorization holds ) is more involved .    in this",
    "talk our understanding of these phenomena is presented .",
    "the sivers effect @xcite was originally suggested to explain the large single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) observed in @xmath1 ( and @xmath7 ) at fnal @xcite and recently at higher energies in the rhic experiment @xcite .",
    "the effect considers a non - trivial correlation between ( the transverse component of ) the nucleon spin @xmath8 and intrinsic transverse parton momenta @xmath9 in the nucleon .",
    "it is proportional to the `` ( naively or artificially ) t - odd '' structure @xmath10 and quantified in terms of the sivers function @xmath11 @xcite responsible for the left - right asymmetry in transversaly polarized nucleon whose precise definition in qcd was worked out only recently @xcite .",
    "our approach to the description of the sivers effect in sidis and drell - yan was described in detail on the spin conference in prague last year @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and we will restrict ourselves to review here only the main points .",
    "the azimuthal ssa measured by hermes & compass in the sidis process @xmath12 ( see fig .  [ fig2-processes - kinematics ] ) is defined as _ + _",
    "r.41        where @xmath13 are the event counts for the respective transverse target polarization .",
    "we assume the distributions of transverse parton and hadron momenta in distribution ( df ) and fragmentation function ( ff ) to be gaussian with corresponding averaged transverse momenta to be flavour and @xmath14- or @xmath15-independent .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are presented in the form of @xcite [ eq : aut - sidis - gauss ] a_ut^(-_s ) & = & ( -2 ) + a_gauss & = & and with [ eq : def - siv - transverse - mom ] f_1t^(1)a(x ) d ^2*p*_t f_1t^a(x,*p*_t^2 ) f_1t^a(x ) .",
    "we use predictions from the qcd limit of a large number of colours @xmath16 . in this limit",
    "it was proven in a model independent way that @xcite [ eq : large - nc ] f_1t^u(x,*p*_t^2 ) = - f_1t^d(x,*p*_t^2 ) for not too small and not too large @xmath14 satisfying @xmath17 .",
    "analog relations hold for the sivers antiquark distributions .    imposing the large-@xmath16 relation ( [ eq : large - nc ] ) as an additional constraint , and neglecting effects of antiquarks and heavier flavours , it is shown @xcite that the hermes data @xcite",
    "can be described by the following 2-parameter ansatz and best fit [ eq : ansatz+fit ] f_1t^(1 ) u(x ) = -f_1t^(1 ) d(x ) a x^b ( 1-x)^5 -0.17 x^0.66(1-x)^5 . the fit and its 1- and 2-@xmath18 uncertainty due to the statistical error of the data @xcite",

    "these data could have been used as an additional constraint for the integrals of @xmath19 in the range @xmath20 , which corresponds to the cuts in the hermes experiment .",
    "this would have helped to improve the significance of the fit , considering that only few @xmath14-data points are available .",
    "instead , we use these data as a valuable cross check of our approach . as the @xmath15-shape of the ssa",
    "is dictated by the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath21 _ and _ the @xmath15-dependence of the gaussian factor @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aut - sidis - gauss ] ) , this is not only a cross check for the extracted sivers function , but it also tests the gauss and the large-@xmath16 ansatz ( [ eq : large - nc ] ) itself . in fig .",
    "[ fig5-compare - to - data]c we confront our fit result ( [ eq : ansatz+fit ] ) with the @xmath15-dependent hermes data on the sivers ssa @xcite .",
    "we observe a satisfactory agreement .    in the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz+fit ] ) we neglected the sivers distributions for antiquarks and for the strange and heavier quarks .",
    "are these reasonable approximations ?",
    "we have explicitly checked that sivers @xmath23- and @xmath24-distributions play a negligible role for the @xmath25 ssa , and give more pronounced effects for the @xmath26 ssa .",
    "in fact , we found that even sizeable sivers @xmath23- and @xmath24-distributions can not be resolved within the error bars of the present data @xcite .",
    "also the neglect of siver strangeness seems reasonable .",
    "we shall , however , come back to this point in the next section .",
    "next let us address the @xmath27-corrections . in order to have an idea of the effect of these corrections ,",
    "let us assume that the flavour singlet sivers distribution is not exactly zero but suppressed by exactly a factor of @xmath27 with respect to the flavour non - singlet combination according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - nc ] ) .",
    "that is , [ eq : model - nc - corr ] |(f_1t^(1)u+f_1t^(1)d)(x ) | ( f_1t^(1)u - f_1t^(1)d)(x ) ,    hr.35     where we use @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz+fit ] ) and set @xmath29 .    on a deuteron target ,",
    "the leading @xmath27 prediction gives zero for the ssa , so that the @xmath27 corrections are all that remain .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the positive and negative hadrons identified at compass are mainly pions , we obtain in our rough model ( [ eq : model - nc - corr ] ) for @xmath27-corrections the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9-aut - nc - compass ] .",
    "clearly , we see that the compass data @xcite are compatible with the large-@xmath16 corrections being of a magnitude compatible with out model .",
    "thus , the reason why our large-@xmath16 approach works here , is due to the fact that current precision of the first experimental data @xcite is comparable to the theoretical accuracy of the large-@xmath16 relation ( [ eq : large - nc ] ) . in future , with increasing precision of the data , it will certainly be necessary to refine the fit ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz+fit ] ) to include @xmath27 corrections and antiquarks .",
    "our fit is in qualitative agreement with extractions of the sivers function @xcite from the same @xcite and from the more recent and more precise ( but _ preliminary _ ) hermes data @xcite ( see @xcite for a detailed comparison ) .      in the hermes experiment",
    "the rich detector allows to separate kaons and pions .",
    "the outcome of the hermes experiment is as follows @xcite .",
    "the sivers ssa for @xmath30 is about ( 10 - 15)% in the region of @xmath31 , i.e. about factor ( 2 - 3 ) larger than the @xmath25 ssa . in the region of @xmath32",
    "it is ( within large error bars ) of comparable size as the @xmath25 ssa .",
    "the @xmath33 sivers ssa is compatible with zero within large error bars .",
    "can one understand this behaviour ?",
    "let us use the results discussed in sec 2.1 in order to estimate the sivers ssa for kaons at hermes .",
    "for @xmath34 we use the parameterization @xcite , for the kaon ff the parameterization @xcite .",
    "we obtain the results shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4kaon ] .    in our estimate",
    "we have neglected the sivers effect for strange quarks .",
    "could therefore the unknown strangeness sivers function yield to some surprises and change drastically the picture in fig .",
    "[ fig4kaon ] ( solid lines ) ?",
    "r.35     let us assume that the @xmath35- and @xmath36-sivers distributions saturate the positivity bound @xcite with the unpolarized distributions @xmath37 from @xcite .",
    "then we obtain the result shown as dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4kaon ] .",
    "we observe that corrections due to the strangeness sivers functions have little impact .",
    "`` the only difference '' between the ssa for @xmath25 and @xmath30 is the exchange @xmath38 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "i.e.   the ratio of the @xmath30 to @xmath25 sivers ssa , one obtains numerically in the hermes kinematics r= , [ ktopiratio ] @xmath40 , where we used the parameterizations @xcite .",
    "how much sivers-@xmath41 is needed to explain @xmath42 ?",
    "just to have a better feeling on that , let us consider two models motivated by our @xcite and the works @xcite :    * model i : @xmath43,@xmath44 * model ii : @xmath45,@xmath46 same as above .",
    "r.35     with models like i and ii the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath25 sivers ssa is a function of the variable @xmath47 only .",
    "thus , it is possible to invert this relation to have @xmath48 as a function of the ( measured ) @xmath30 to @xmath49 sivers ssa ratio .",
    "the exact result of this operation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - r(k / pi ) ] which illustrates that one can obtain rather large @xmath42 enhancements with still moderate values of @xmath50 in the models i and ii .",
    "of course , the models i and ii are particular _",

    "a particularly interesting feature of the sivers function ( and other `` t - odd '' distributions ) concerns the universality property . on the basis of time - reversal arguments",
    "it was predicted @xcite that @xmath51 in sidis and dy have opposite sign ( we follow the trento conventions @xcite ) , [ eq:01 ] f_1t^(x,*p*_t^2)_= -f_1t^(x,*p*_t^2)_. the experimental check of eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) would provide a thorough test of our understanding of the sivers effect within qcd .",
    "in particular , the experimental verification of ( [ eq:01 ] ) is a crucial prerequisite for testing the factorization approach to the description of processes containing @xmath52-dependent correlators @xcite .    on the basis of the fist information of the sivers effect in sidis @xcite it was shown that the sivers effect leads to sizeable ssa in @xmath53 , which could be studied at compass , and in @xmath54 or @xmath55 in the planned pax experiment at gsi @xcite , making the experimental check of eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) feasible and promising @xcite .",
    "both experiments , which could be performed in the medium or long term , have the advantage of being dominated by annihilation of valence quarks ( from @xmath56 ) and valence antiquarks ( from @xmath57 or @xmath26 ) , which yields sizeable counting rates . moreover , the processes are not very sensitive to the sivers antiquark distributions , which are not constrained by the present sidis data , see @xcite .    on a shorter term the sivers effect in dy",
