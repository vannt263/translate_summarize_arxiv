    "the in - vivo radio - resistance of human tumor cells varies greatly .",
    "some tumor types have high degrees of radio - resistance both in - vitro and in clinical experience .",
    "these tumors include glioblastoma multiforme @xcite , poorly differentiated / anaplastic thyroid cancer @xcite , unresectable salivary tumors @xcite , certain head and neck sarcomas @xcite , and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas that recur after prior radiotherapy @xcite .",
    "the lack of durable radiation response within these tumor types poses a significant clinical challenge .",
    "patients with these tumors have some of the worst disease - free and overall survival statistics among all cancer patients .",
    "double - strand breaks generated by particle tracks with high linear energy transfer ( let ) are thought to be more complex and more difficult to repair @xcite .",
    "the treatment of salivary tumors , thyroid malignancies and glioblastoma with neutrons and carbon ions has demonstrated increased local control when compared with historical controls . for protons ,",
    "the let and relative biological effectiveness ( rbe ) vary along particle trajectories , increasing towards track ends .",
    "although an absolute prediction of rbe values is very difficult , the relationship between rbe and let can be approximated as linear .",
    "proton treatment plans that exploit this rise in let to deliver increased biological dose ( bd ) to the target can potentially result in improved outcomes for radio - resistant tumors .    to estimate bd distributions ,",
    "one requires the dose - averaged let ( let@xmath0 ) .",
    "the most reliable way to calculate let@xmath0 is through monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , since contributions from secondary particles produced in non - elastic proton - nucleus interactions can be significant .",
    "previous authors have employed a variety of methods to elevate the target bd @xcite .",
    "bd escalation methods that involve the use of mc techniques are usually of the forward - planning type .",
    "furthermore , they are not clinically viable because cpu - based mc calculations are overly time - consuming . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "mc - calculated let@xmath0 distributions have not yet been directly incorporated in inverse planning for proton therapy . compared to other bd escalation methods , mc - based inverse biological planning",
    "is not only expected to be more accurate , but also to produce plans with more conformal and homogeneous bd , and with better normal tissue sparing .",
    "the goal of this work is to demonstrate clinically - applicable , mc - based inverse biological planning in pencil - beam scanning proton therapy .",
    "the target bd is escalated in comparison with conventional intensity modulated proton therapy ( impt ) planning , while keeping the same organ - at - risk ( oar ) constraints and restricting physical dose ( pd ) hotspots to within 25% or so of the prescription dose .",
    "two pieces of software that made such plans calculable in less than 30 minutes are : ( a ) a gpu - based proton transport mc @xcite , and ( b ) a gpu - based impt optimizer that uses pre - calculated , spot - wise let@xmath0 and pd maps from the mc @xcite .",
    "the applicability and limitations of the method is illustrated with four cases .",
    "the focus is on head - and - neck tumors , although other sites can benefit as well .",
    "recently , our group has developed a very fast and accurate proton transport mc for the gpu , with net computational times of @xmath120s for @xmath2 proton histories @xcite .",
    "this gpu - based mc includes a bertini cascade simulation @xcite for handling non - elastic interactions on an event - by - event basis , and is thus capable of performing accurate let@xmath0 computations .",
    "the mc model for computing the pd was extensively verified with topas version beta-6 @xcite and geant4.9.6 .",
    "the let@xmath0 computations were also compared with topas predictions . as an example , figure 1 shows the pd and let@xmath0 calculations from topas and our in - house mc for a head - and - neck patient .",
    "the 3d - gamma @xcite pass rate at 2%/2 mm was above 98% for the dose calculation .     and physical dose calculations are shown in the top and bottom left panels , respectively .",
    "the corresponding computations from the in - house gpu - based mc are shown on the right . ]      in addition , our group has built a fast gpu - accelerated impt optimizer @xcite , which uses the previously - described mc as the dose calculation engine . on a 24-gpu system , this optimizer can generate impt plans within a clinically viable time frame ( i.e. within 30 minutes ) .",
    "because they are mc - based , these plans are not adversely affected by inaccuracies due to tissue heterogeneities .",
    "the impt optimizer was slightly modified for the purposes of this work , by allowing the input of let@xmath0 maps , implementing voxel - wise bd estimates ( see equation 1 below ) , and modifying the cost function .      to simplify the bd calculation during the optimization process ,",
    "a simple linear relationship between let@xmath0 and bd was assumed : @xmath3 where @xmath4=0.05 @xmath5m / kev and @xmath6=0.95 .",
    "pd and let@xmath0 are in units of gy and kev/@xmath5 m , respectively .",
    "these coefficients were chosen so that equation 1 roughly corresponds to a linear - quadratic model with @xmath7 gy . with these values of a and b , equation 1 yields a dependence of rbe on let@xmath0 that is close to previously published models from carabe et al @xcite , wedenberg et al @xcite and mcnamara et al @xcite , which were derived from fits to in - vitro cell survival data .",
    "a dose per fraction of 2 gy was assumed when comparing equation 1 to these models .",
    "the post - optimization bd was evaluated by using the published models instead of equation 1 .",
    "the term in brackets is the deviation from the conventional @xmath8 .",
    "suggestive evidence for a linear relation between rbe and let can be found in references @xcite .",
    "the same linear relation was naively assumed to be valid for all cell kinds . as discussed below",
    ", the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath6 values ( and hence @xmath9 ) does not affect the ability of the optimizer to converge to a plan with increase target let@xmath0 .",
    "the assumed value of @xmath7 gy is our rough guess for highly radio - resistant tumors .      for each patient in this study ,",
    "the following three plans were created :    1 .   a photon imrt plan 2 .",
    "a conventional two or three - field impt plan 3 .",
    "a five - field biologically optimized plan , using the in - house treatment planning system ( tps ) described above .",
    "the imrt and impt planning were done using a commercially - available tps ( eclipse , varian medical systems ) .",
    "the number of fields used in the conventional impt plans is reflective of our current clinical practice .    to create the biologically optimized plan , an optimization target volume ( otv ) @xcite , which is akin to a planning target volume ( ptv ) , was derived from the physician - delineated clinical target volume ( ctv ) , and expanded by 0.5 cm to create a scanning target volume ( stv ) .",
    "the mc was then used to place spots inside the stv , with a hexagonal spot spacing of 0.5 cm , and the pd and let@xmath0 maps for each spot was calculated using @xmath10 proton histories . to minimize gpu memory use ,",
    "voxels receiving less than 0.5% of the maximum dose were ignored @xcite .",
    "constraints were placed so as to maintain the otv pd to within @xmath125% of the prescription dose , while maximizing the otv bd . to achieve this ,",
    "a lower limit was placed on the otv bd ( 115% of prescription dose ) and the relative weights of the pd constraint and bd objective were adaptively changed during each optimization step .",
    "the biologically - optimized , impt and imrt plans had the same oar pd constraints .",
    "the plan that best satisfies the above requirements is the ` biologically optimal ' plan .",
    "it should be stressed that constraints were not set on the bd for oars , since absolute bd values are currently not reliably calculable . even if they were , relating the high - let proton bd to past photon - based experience is not trivial .",
    "in this work , the proton pd constraints for oars in plans 2 and 3 were derived from photon dose constraints , assuming an rbe of 1.1 .",
    "the impt plan was recalculated using our in - house mc to obtain its let@xmath0 and bd distributions .",
    "the percentage gains in bd and let@xmath0 in plan 3 relative to plan 2 were quantified by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the mean target bd and let@xmath0 in plans 2 and 3 .",
    "similarly , the increase in mean pd in plan 3 relative to plan 2 is : @xmath16 ideally , it is desirable to have large @xmath17 and @xmath18 for a small @xmath19 , i.e. keep the target pd as close to the prescription dose as possible .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 are used to assess the gain in bd and let@xmath0 relative to the increase in pd .",
    "although the magnitude of @xmath17 depends on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 in equation 1 , the optimization process does not . in other words",
    ", the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath6 does not affect the ability of the in - house tps to converge to a biologically optimal plan .",
    "for each patient , after optimization the bd distributions were generated using the rbe ",
    "let@xmath0 relations from references @xcite and equation 1 . for each rbe model , the pd and bd dose - volume histograms ( dvhs ) from plan 3 were compared with plan 2 to assess @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and oar doses . to remove dependence on the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath6 , @xmath21",
    "was calculated using the average @xmath17 obtained from the carabe , wedenberg and mcnamara models . before calculating these metrics ,",
    "all plans were normalized so that 98% of the target gets the prescription dose .",
    "comparisons were also made with plan 1 to gauge oar pd sparing relative to standard imrt treatment .",
    "values of @xmath18 and @xmath22 were also calculated for each patient .",
    "in contrast to @xmath17 and @xmath21 , these are completely model - independent .",
    "this method can not be successfully applied to all patients . intuitively , the magnitude of @xmath17 depends on the number of beams , their directions and target volume .",
    "beam directions should be preferentially spread out isotropically around the target to facilitate let@xmath0 elevation .",
    "however , this somewhat defeats the purpose of proton therapy , and normal tissue irradiation should be avoided where possible .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of any beam can be substantially reduced if an oar is in its path .",
    "bd escalation in large - volume targets is expected to be more difficult to achieve , since low let@xmath0 track sections inevitably contribute to the dose .    in this study ,",
    "four cases are discussed to illustrate the above points :    a.   small thyroid tumor , otv size : 94 @xmath23 b.   small thyroid tumor with oar in the path of posterior beams , otv size : 108 @xmath23 c.   large thyroid tumor , otv size : 654 @xmath23 d.   small brain stem tumor , otv size : 9 @xmath23    the field directions and target geometries in each case are shown in figure 2 below .",
    "the prescription doses for cases a - d were 66 , 60 , 66 and 54 gy , in 33 , 50 , 30 and 30 fractions , respectively .",
    "cases b and c were included to demonstrate situations where our technique would not be applicable . in case",
    "b the left brachial plexus ( shown as the yellow contour ) is in the path of the posterior beams .",
    "case d demonstrates the applicability of the technique to a site outside the neck region .",
    "the initial pd and let@xmath0 map calculations , as well as the bd optimization , were carried out on a remote cluster @xcite using 10 to 50 nvidia k20x cards , depending on the target volume .",
    "a multi - gpu system is mandatory due to the sheer scale of the initial map computations . in the optimization stage ,",
    "the workload was also divided among a large number of gpus .",
    "fast inter - node communication was therefore essential for efficient data transfer .",
    "further details of the multi - gpu implementation are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the bd distributions from the mc re - calculations of the conventional eclipse impt plans ( left ) and our biologically optimized plans ( right ) , for patients a to d. the bd distributions in figure 2 were generated using the mcnamara model with @xmath7 gy ( please see appendix for the let@xmath0 colorwash distribution ) .",
    "the values of @xmath19 , @xmath17 from each publised rbe model @xcite and their averages at @xmath7 and 6 gy , @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 for all cases are given in table 1 .",
    "patients a and d had nearly 60% increase in the mean target let@xmath0 and demonstrate the largest values of @xmath22 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath25 are model - dependent . for patients a and d with @xmath7 gy , raising the target pd by 5.1 and 8.6% resulted in 11.3 and 17.3% increase in target bd ( i.e. relative gains of 2.21 and 2.02 , respectively ) .",
    "patients b and c had less favorable results , the gain in bd being marginal relative to the increase in pd .",
    "the gain in mean let@xmath0 relative to the pd increase was also much lower than for a and d. oar dvhs for patients a ( larynx and esophagus ) and d ( optic chiasm and pituitary gland ) from the biologically optimized , standard impt and imrt plans are shown in figure 3 .",

    "bd optimization by mc - based inverse planning has been demonstrated for two patients with small tumor targets ( a and d ) . for a modest rise in mean target dose , roughly twice as much increase in bd",
    "was obtained .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are a rough guide to the extent of the bd escalation ` quality ' .",
    "a high value of @xmath21 means that not much additional pd is required to significantly boost the target bd , which implies that the target dose can stay relatively close to prescription . for plans with high @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", the bd gain is a consequence of the successful and deliberate placement of high - let track ends inside the targets .    compared to conventional impt planning",
    ", more beams were required to elevate let@xmath0 in the target .",
    "as observed in figure 2 , the beams were not spread uniformly around the target in order to spare normal tissue .",
    "however , a higher degree of bd escalation could have been achieved by irradiating the opposite areas .",
    "a five - beam arrangement was used in this work because splitting the beams ( but keeping the same anatomical avoidance regions ) does not result in significantly larger @xmath21 and @xmath22 values . for a small - target patient ,",
    "the bd gain of a 10-field plan was found to be comparable to that of a 5-field plan .",
    "the limitations of the methods are illustrated by cases b and c. as shown in case c , achieving bd escalation in large - volume targets is far more challenging because of the unavoidable contribution of low - let track sections to pd .",
    "case b has comparable volume to a , but the presence of an oar ( the left brachial plexus ) in the path of the posterior beams considerably diminished their contribution . as a result , the remaining field directions ended up being rather similar to those in the impt plan , and no significant bd boost was achieved .",
    "figure 3 shows that dose sparing to critical structures in the biologically optimized plans is improved compared to both eclipse imrt and impt plans .",
    "in contrast to eclipse , the in - house optimization algorithm continuously drove down the dose to a given oar even when user - defined constraints on it were met . to achieve this ,",
    "the user - defined upper constraints and their weightings were automatically adjusted during each iteration step @xcite .",
    "it might be thought that the bd gain relative to standard impt planning was mostly due to the additional fields , and that a 5-field impt plan would demonstrate a similar level of bd gain .",
    "in fact , bd escalation can not be deliberately achieved if the optimizer is not explicitly instructed to do so . to illustrate this ,",
    "a 5-field standard impt plan was created in eclipse for patient d , using the same beam angles , constraints and objectives ( except the bd objective , which can not be applied ) as the biologically optimized plan .",
    "figure 4 shows the let@xmath0 colorwash distributions for the 5-field impt and biologically optimized plans in an axial cut .",
    "the central plot shows the let@xmath0 profile across the target .",
    "although the target pd objectives and oar constraints were met by both plans , the let@xmath0 distributions are very different from each other .",
    "the two peaks in the red curve indicate that eclipse placed high - let proton track ends near the target edges .",
    "conversely , the biologically optimized plan was constructed such that protons stopped preferentially within the target , resulting in bd escalation .",
    "relative to the 3 field conventional impt plan , the values of @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath21 ( @xmath7 gy ) obtained for the 5-field eclipse impt plan were 1.8% , 2.1% and 1.17 , showing no evidence for bd escalation .",

    "the same beam angles , objectives and constraints were used in both plans ( see text ) . ]    it should be pointed out that although our let@xmath0 predictions are in very good agreement in topas , recent work @xcite has shown that the default let@xmath26 scoring method in early topas versions ( including beta-6 , which we used in this work ) is biased . to resolve this , the let@xmath0 scoring method adopted in our mc",
    "will be modified to use tabulated unrestricted stopping power tables , based on recommendations from references @xcite . in the near future",
    ", we also plan to update our optimizer to use a linear - quadratic rbe model @xcite instead of equation 1 .",
    "the use of a linear rbe model in this feasibility study was purely out of simplicity , and this update is not expected to impact our ability to achieve bd escalation .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "a multi - gpu system is necessary to perform the calculations within a clinically acceptable timeframe . compared to a k20x , a titan x card can process a given dose calculation in around half the time . from table 2 , assuming the processing time to scale with the number of gpus , a system consisting of 24 nvidia titan x cards can complete the calculations for case a in under 30 minutes .      a feasibility trial on proton bd optimization is planned to start at our institution in 2016 .",
    "this trial is geared towards patients with : ( a ) anaplastic thyroid cancers , ( b ) salivary gland tumors , ( c ) recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck , and ( d ) recurrent glioblastomas .",

    "candidates will be planned using both standard impt and biological planning , and the treatment modality will be chosen at the physician s discretion .",
    "the requirements for treatment using the biologically optimal plan include large @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 values .",
    "by taking advantage of gpu acceleration , the bd in small tumors was successfully escalated via mc - based inverse planning optimization . in the examples given , compared to standard impt planning , a modest increase in the target pd significantly raised the mean let@xmath0 and can result in twice as much increase in the bd .",
