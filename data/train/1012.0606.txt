    "crosstalk affects the function of many complex engineering systems . in microelectronic circuits , as the frequencies increase , it is increasingly hard to ensure proper function without isolating the various components from electromagnetic interference . in wireless communications ,",
    "we need to make sure that the input and output signal frequency spectrums are relatively narrow to avoid crosstalk with other communication systems . in chemical and biomolecular systems , different molecules",
    "interact with each other in a solution without explicit mechanisms that bring them in contact . as a result",
    ", there is a potentially large number of spurious interactions , despite which the cell can function without problems .",
    "the potential amount of unwanted crosstalk interactions increases as a function of the number of the individual elements in the network , so there is the need to design systems that are optimized to minimize or at least decrease the amount of spurious interactions , in order to keep the network functional . in biological networks",
    ", this need is more pronounced since signaling is implemented through variations of molecular concentrations .",
    "crosstalk does not seem to be a problem in the cell , or any other natural biological system , despite the large variety of molecules , and the intricate patterns of interactions .",
    "however , in biological design , even the simplest systems suffer from crosstalk between different elements , notwithstanding the small complexity of such artificial systems @xcite .",
    "if there are molecules that randomly interact with each other without performing any function , the effective concentration of each molecule which is available to participate in any given pathway will tend to decrease , and therefore the efficiency of the circuit will diminish .    in this paper , we find the structure of graphs with the smallest possible sensitivity to crosstalk , assuming that the crosstalk affinity of each vertex is either specific to each unit in the network and independent of anything else , or is a function of its degree , namely the number of other units with which it is designed to interact within the network .",
    "this section provides a brief introduction to the notions needed from graph theory that are used throughout this study .",
    "a _ graph _ ( also called a _ network _ ) is an ordered pair @xmath0 comprised of a set @xmath1 of _ vertices _ together with a set @xmath2 of _ edges _ that are unordered 2-element subsets of @xmath3 .",
    "two vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called _ neighbors _ if they are connected through an edge ( @xmath6 ) and we write @xmath7 , otherwise we write @xmath8 .",
    "the _ neighborhood _",
    "@xmath9 of a vertex @xmath4 is the set its neighbors .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex is the number of neighbors it has .",
    "a vertex is said to have _ full degree _ if it is connected to every other vertex in the network .",
    "a network is _ assortative _ with respect to its degree distribution when the vertices in the network are connected to others that have similar degrees .",
    "all graphs in this article are _ simple _ , meaning that all edges connect two different vertices , and there is no more than one edge between any pair of vertices .",
    "the _ order _ of a graph is the number of its vertices , @xmath10 .",
    "a graph s _ size _ is @xmath11 , the number of edges .",
    "we will denote a graph @xmath12 of order @xmath13 and size @xmath14 as @xmath15 or simply @xmath16 .",
    "complete graph _ is a graph in which each vertex is connected to every other .",
    "a _ clique _ in a graph is a subset of its vertices such that every two vertices in the subset are connected .",
    "the _ order _ of a clique is the number of vertices that belong to it .",
    "a _ graphic sequence _ is a sequence of numbers which can be the degree sequence of a graph .",
    "a _ path _ is a sequence of consecutive edges in a graph and the length of the path is the number of edges traversed .",
    "a graph is _ connected _ if for every pair of vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , there is a path from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . otherwise the graph is called _",
    "disconnected_. a _ tree _ is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path .",
    "a weighted graph associates a weight with every edge .",
    "weights will be restricted to positive real numbers .",
    "an edge is _ rewired _ when we change the vertices it is adjacent to .",
    "single rewiring _ takes place when we change one of the vertices that is adjacent to it , and a _",
    "double rewiring _ when we change both of them .",
    "finally , a subgraph @xmath17 of a graph @xmath12 is called _ induced _ if @xmath18 and for any pair of vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath19 , @xmath20",
    "if and only if @xmath21 . in other words , @xmath17 is an induced subgraph of @xmath12 if it has the same edges that appear in @xmath12 over the same vertex set .",
    "assume that we have a weighted graph that represents a network of interactions .",
    "we define crosstalk as additional unmodeled interactions among the vertices of the network .",
    "these edges are randomly distributed across the network , and typically have smaller weights than the original ones . throughout the paper ,",
    "we denote the order of the network @xmath10 as @xmath13 , and its size @xmath11 as @xmath14 .",
    "we require that there can not be any unwanted interactions among vertices that are already connected in the original network .",
    "the crosstalk matrix , denoted by @xmath22 , is the weight matrix of all the crosstalk interactions .",
    "if there is crosstalk between vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the matrix element @xmath23 will contain the intensity of that interaction .",
    "we will assume that the crosstalk affinity between any pair of vertices @xmath24 , is bounded : @xmath25    given a local measure of the crosstalk interaction @xmath26 among two vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the _ overall sensitivity to crosstalk _ of a network of interactions is defined as the sum of the intensities of all the spurious interactions among individual units that are not connected , @xmath27    when the network in question is obvious from the context , we will refer to its sensitivity to crosstalk simply as @xmath28 .",
    "the order of the graph is finite , so the overall crosstalk sensitivity is bounded .",
    "@xmath29 we will call @xmath30 the _ maximum possible crosstalk intensity _ of the network .",
    "it is only a function of the size and order of the network along with the maximum possible crosstalk intensity of any pair of vertices , which depends on the network and is independent of its specific structure .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 is constant , assuming that each crosstalk interaction represents the average over a time period .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath31 has minimum sensitivity to crosstalk , or that it is a _ minimum crosstalk graph _",
    ", if for any other graph @xmath32 of the same order and size , we have @xmath33    in what follows , we analyze the crosstalk sensitivity of networks in three different cases .",
    "the first is when the crosstalk affinity of each vertex depends only on its physical properties , specific to each network .",
    "the second and third cases assume that the crosstalk affinity of each vertex is an increasing function of its degree .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , especially in biological networks , natural or man - made .",
    "biological molecules ( proteins , for example ) which are supposed to interact with many others , have a less specific shape .",
    "this is exactly the reason why they can also randomly interact with many other unrelated molecules .",
    "the same argument holds for molecules that are very specific , and can interact with a small subset of the rest of the molecules in the network . in dna systems , if a strand is designed to interact with many others , it is usually longer and , as a result it can stick to many unrelated strands that are floating in the solution . in communication networks , transceivers that are sensitive to a large spectrum of frequencies",
    "are more likely to pick up noise or other random signals from surrounding transmitters , and the opposite is true for transceivers which have a narrow input and output frequency range .      in this first case ,",
    "we assume that the amount of crosstalk depends on the specific vertices of the network and the way they interact with each other . for this reason",
    ", we have no control over their intensity . for a given number of vertices , the larger the size of the graph , the fewer the pairs of vertices that can spuriously interact with each other , and the overall sensitivity to crosstalk",
    "is decreased .",
    "two extreme cases are the tree graph , when the number of edges is equal to the minimum possible ( @xmath34 , given that the graph is required to be connected ) and the complete graph , where @xmath35 . in the tree graph",
    "we have @xmath36 pairs of vertices that may spuriously interact .",
    "the complete graph has no crosstalk interactions , simply because every vertex is designed to interact with every other . in a network with size @xmath14 ,",
    "the overall crosstalk sensitivity @xmath37 will be bounded by these two extremes , @xmath38 we can optimize the structure of this network , by connecting the @xmath14 pairs of vertices with the strongest interactions among each other , thus reducing @xmath39 .",
    "a more interesting problem arises when the intensity of crosstalk interaction is a function of the vertex degrees . in this case",
    ", we denote the crosstalk affinity of vertex @xmath4 with degree @xmath40 and vertex @xmath5 with degree @xmath41 as @xmath42 which represents the intensity of the crosstalk interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath43 is assumed to be a strictly increasing function in both its arguments , reflecting our assumption that the more neighbors a vertex has , the more likely it is to interact with vertices it is not connected with .",
    "we also assume that @xmath43 is symmetric , @xmath44 the affinity @xmath45 of a vertex @xmath4 is similarly defined as its tendency to interact with other vertices of the network with which it is not connected , and consequently not supposed to interact .",
    "the following sections present two scenarios , the first defines @xmath43 as the sum of the affinity functions of the two vertices , and the other defines @xmath43 as the product of their affinities .",
    "if @xmath46 is an additive function , we can write it as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is defined as the affinity of each individual vertex , and is a strictly increasing function of its degree . we will refer to this type of crosstalk interactions in the network as _ additive crosstalk_. the overall sensitivity to crosstalk will then be equal to @xmath49        assume that the function @xmath50 can be written as the product of two functions @xmath51 and @xmath43 , with @xmath48 being strictly increasing , differentiable and concave function , and @xmath52 is strictly decreasing , differentiable and concave",
    ". then @xmath53 is strictly concave .",
    "[ concaveproductlemma ]      assume we have a differentiable function @xmath48 , with @xmath62 and @xmath57 for every @xmath63 .",
    "further assume that for @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 , and for which @xmath66",
    ". then @xmath67 .",
    "[ concavelemma ]    according to the mean value theorem , there exist numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 since @xmath51 is concave , @xmath72 replacing these derivatives from the equations above , we get @xmath73 since @xmath66 , the denominators are equal by assumption , @xmath74 and as a consequence @xmath75 rearranging the terms , the result follows : @xmath76      assume that the function @xmath48 that defines the affinity of each vertex of the network is a strictly increasing concave function of the vertex degree .",
    "then the total affinity of every vertex @xmath4 is equal to @xmath78 and the degree distribution of the network with the minimum additive sensitivity to crosstalk is inhomogeneous .    as shown in equation ( [ definitionadditiveequation ] ) , the crosstalk intensity between any pair of vertices is only a function of their degrees .",
    "furthermore , the affinity of each vertex is only a function of its degree , and independent of the vertices it interacts with . as a result ,",
    "@xmath79 since @xmath77 is also a function of the vertex degree , we will denote the total affinity as @xmath80 . from lemma [ concaveproductlemma ] , it is easy to see that @xmath53 is a positive , strictly increasing and concave function , since @xmath81 is a decreasing positive linear function for @xmath82 and @xmath51 is assumed to be positive , increasing and concave .",
    "the network which is most robust to crosstalk will be the one with degree distribution @xmath83 $ ] such that @xmath84 under the constraints @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the space of graphic degree sequences for connected graphs . rewriting equation ( [ definitionadditiveequation ] )",
    ", we get : @xmath88 the function @xmath28 is a sum of concave functions , and thus concave . according to lemma [ concavelemma ] ,",
    "the optimal @xmath89 will be achieved for @xmath40 s at the boundaries of the plausible values in the inequality ( [ plausibledegreesinequality ] ) .",
    "when the crosstalk affinity between two vertices is an additive function of their degrees , the overall crosstalk sensitivity only depends on the vertex degrees , and does not depend on the structure of the network .",
    "in other words , how robust the network is to crosstalk only depends on its degree distribution .",
    "the star network has one vertex with full degree and this vertex has no crosstalk interactions .",
    "the @xmath90 peripheral vertices have degree @xmath91 , and may spuriously interact with each other .",
    "hence , @xmath92    every other graph will have vertices with degrees @xmath93 with at least one vertex with degree @xmath94 .",
    "the total number of crosstalk interactions is equal to twice the number of edges that are _ not _ present in the network , namely @xmath95 .",
    "the sum of all the crosstalk interactions @xmath96 will then be @xmath97    suppose that a vertex @xmath4 is connected to vertex @xmath5 with degree @xmath41 , and is not connected to vertex @xmath98 with degree @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath100 , and we can rewire the edge @xmath101 to @xmath102 while keeping the graph connected , then the sensitivity of the new network to additive crosstalk is smaller .",
    "[ increasingdegreescorollary ]    the only vertices whose affinities change are @xmath5 and @xmath98 , since the degree of @xmath4 , along with any other vertex in the network , stays the same .",
    "thus , @xmath103+\\left [ h(d_{w}+1)-h(d_{w } ) \\right ] \\notag \\\\ < & 0 . \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last inequality holds because @xmath53 is concave ( lemma [ concaveproductlemma ] ) and @xmath104 .        counting the elements of the sets @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 in addition , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the kronecker delta function , defined as @xmath117 as a result , @xmath118 the necessity of condition ( [ degreesubsetcondition ] ) is proved , and we will next show the sufficiency of the statement by assuming otherwise and arriving at a contradiction .",
    "suppose that @xmath119 , but @xmath120 .",
    "this means that there is at least one vertex that is connected to @xmath109 , but is not connected to @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath121 be a vertex with degree @xmath122 such that @xmath123 since the graph @xmath12 has the minimum sensitivity to crosstalk , by corollary [ increasingdegreescorollary ] , this means that @xmath109 is connected to all vertices that have degree larger than @xmath124 . if it did not , we could rewire the edge @xmath125 to connect @xmath109 with a vertex with a larger degree .",
    "the same applies for vertex @xmath110 , and since @xmath126 , the only way that vertex @xmath110 would not be connected to @xmath124 , is when it is connected to some other vertex @xmath127 with degree equal to the degree of @xmath124 , @xmath128 even in that case , if we rewire the edge that connects @xmath110 with @xmath127 , so that after rewiring it connects @xmath110 with @xmath124 , the difference of overall crosstalk sensitivity for the graph @xmath12 will be negative @xmath129 because the total crosstalk affinity function @xmath53 is strictly concave .",
    "this means that @xmath12 was not a graph with minimum crosstalk sensitivity , which is a contradiction .        in this section",
    ", we describe an algorithm that finds the structure of the network with the minimum sensitivity to additive crosstalk .",
    "we will first explain how it works , and then prove that it always returns the optimal network , regardless of the input graph .",
    "the algorithm consists of two steps : the first step ( single rewirings ) ensures that the condition of equation ( [ degreesubsetcondition ] ) holds . in every iteration , it checks if each vertex could be connected to another neighbor with larger degree , therefore decreasing the overall crosstalk sensitivity of the graph , according to corollary [ increasingdegreescorollary ] .",
    "the second step ensures that the required changes that are not possible with single - vertex rewirings actually take place .",
    "after the first step is finished ( there are no more possible single - vertex rewirings ) , the degrees of all vertices satisfy equation ( [ degreesubsetcondition ] ) .",
    "the resulting graph is not necessarily one with the minimum possible sensitivity , because we may have a situation like the one depicted in figure [ doublerewiringmotivation ] , where we need to rewire one edge such that we change both vertices it is adjacent to . in this case",
    ", we can not perform a single rewiring , and we need to delete an edge from a pair of vertices , and add it to another .",
    "there are only two possible arrangements of the edges among four vertices that may need a double rewiring transformation ( shown in figure [ allpossible4vertexcases ] ) , and the condition that the degrees of these vertices need to satisfy is shown in table [ degreeorderdoublerewiringstable ] .",
    ".all the possible degree orderings of the degrees of the four vertices shown in figure [ allpossible4vertexcases ] , with the difference in the overall crosstalk sensitivity if we rewire the edge between @xmath131 and @xmath132 to connect vertices @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and assuming that all possible single rewirings that decrease crosstalk have already taken place . in all but two cases , the overall sensitivity to crosstalk increases .",
    "cases @xmath135 and @xmath136 may have a positive or negative difference ( red question marks ) , depending on the crosstalk function @xmath53,and only if the degrees of the vertices @xmath137 are ordered as shown . note that case @xmath138 is not possible at any time , but is included here for completeness . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if both transformations result in an increase in the overall crosstalk sensitivity , this means that the current arrangement of edges ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) is optimal .",
    "this happens when one of the following inequalities hold : @xmath141 @xmath142    also note that transformation @xmath143 always yields a network with smaller overall crosstalk sensitivity than transformation @xmath144 , because @xmath145 by the assumption of the relative degrees of the pairs @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath146 this shows that the overall sensitivity of a graph does not depend on the order in which we apply any transformations .",
    "the difference in the overall crosstalk sensitivity is equal to the sum of individual differences , and the only thing that matters is the structure of the network before and after the performed changes . in order to minimize the overall sensitivity to crosstalk , we need to connect vertices with large degrees with other vertices with large degrees and similarly for vertices with small degrees .        a graphic sequence @xmath149 $ ] with @xmath150 .",

    "the only problem would be if this network is not connected . in this case",
