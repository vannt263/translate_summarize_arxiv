    "one of the primary motivations of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisons is to create and study in the laboratory the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) as predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "experiments have been carried out at bnl - ags and cern - sps energies , and will be continued at higher energies of bnl - rhic and cern - lhc colliders @xcite .",
    "the measurement of electromagnetic observables such as photon and dilepton spectra constitutes a major part of these efforts .",
    "the main reason for this is that the photons and dileptons do not suffer strong final - state interactions as hadrons do .",
    "they can thus be considered as ` penetrating probes ' of the initial hot and dense stages where the qgp might be formed in these ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "so far , the measurement of eletromagnetic observables has chiefly been carried out at cern - sps energies .",
    "recent observation of the enhancement of low - mass dileptons in central heavy - ion collisions by the ceres @xcite and helios-3 collaborations @xcite has generated a great deal of interest in the heavy - ion community .",
    "different dynamical models , such as hydrodynamical and transport models , have been used to investigate this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "calculations based on ` conventional sources ' such as dalitz decay and direct vector meson decay that account for the dilepton spectra in proton - induced reactions fail to explain the observed enhancement in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "various medium effects , such as the dropping vector meson masses @xcite as first proposed by brown and rho @xcite , the modification of rho meson spectral function @xcite , and the enhanced production of @xmath1 and/or @xmath4 @xcite , have been proposed to explain this enhancement .",
    "another piece of experimental data from cern - sps that have been discussed extensively is the single photon spectra in central s+au collisions from the wa80 collaboration @xcite . in this experiment , @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra",
    "were measured simultaneously , so that their contributions to single photon spectra can be subtracted .",
    "it was found that the direct photon excess over these background sources is about 5% for central s+au collisions @xcite .",
    "similar measurement of inclusive photon spectra has been carried out by the ceres collaboration @xcite .",
    "the results are very much in agreement with those of wa80 , namely , the inclusive photon spectra can be basically explained by hadronic decay , particularly radiative decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "many hydrodynamical calculations have been carried out to study photon spectra in these reactions @xcite . in all these calculations , it is found that the contributions from the qgp , if it were formed at all in these reactions , to the single photon yield is negligibly small .",
    "the major contributions to these so - called ` thermal ' photons , namely , excessive photons over the background of @xmath0 and @xmath1 radiative decays , come from hadronic interactions .    in a number of papers @xcite ,",
    "the absence of significant thermal photons has been interpreted as an evidence for the formation of quark gluon plasma . without phase transition ,",
    "the initial temperature of the hadronic gas was found to be about 400 mev @xcite .",
    "this led to a large amount of thermal photons from hadronic interaction which was not observed experimentally . including the phase transition , the initial temperature can be lowered to about 200 mev @xcite , because of increased degrees of freedom .",
    "this lower initial temperature natually reduces the thermal photon yield to be in agreement with the wa80 data .",
    "there is , however , a major caveat in this type of analysis and reasoning , namely , the initial temperature in the hadronic scenarios depends sensitively on how many hadron resonances are included in the analysis . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that including a reasonable amount of hadron resonances the initial temperature can be reduced to about 250 mev .",
    "furthermore it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , if all the hadron resonances with masses below 2.5 gev are included , the initial temperature can be lowered to about 200 mev . in both papers",
    ", it was shown that the wa80 photon data can be explained without invoking the formation of quark gluon plasma .",
    "there are , up till now , no detailed transport model calculations for photon spectra in heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , results from the hadron - string dynamics ( hsd ) , that includes photons from the decay of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , were compared with the data and were found to be far below the upper bound set by the wa80 collaboration .",
    "however , photons can also be produced from the decay of rho mesons , baryon resonances , and two - body scattering processes such as @xmath6 and @xmath8 , which were neglected in ref .",
    "whether the inclusion of these additional sources will bring the theoretical results close or even beyond the upper bound of the wa80 data needs to be studied .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is thus to calculate the single photon spectra in central s+au collisions based on the relativistic transport model and to compare with hydrodynamical results .",
    "the other purpose is to see whether the same model that explains the enhancement of low - mass dileptons , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , can also explain the lack of signal in the direct photon measurement .",
    "explaining simultaneously these two correlated facts constitutes an important test for the consistency of the model .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 we recall briefly the main ingredients of the relativistic transport model . in section 3",
    "we discuss various source for photon production , inlcuding meson and baryon decay , as well as two - body scattering .",
    "we shall discuss radiative decay widths and photon production cross sections in two - body processes .",
    "the results are discussions are presented in section 4 .",
    "the paper ends with a brief summary in section 5 .",
    "in studying medium effects in heavy - ion collisions , the relativistic transport model @xcite based on the walecka - type model @xcite has been quite useful , as it provides a thermodynamically consistent description of the medium effects through the scalar and vector fields . in heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps energies ,",
    "many hadrons are produced in the initial nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "this is usually modeled by the fragmentation of strings , which are the chromoelectric flux - tubes excited from the interacting quarks . one successful model for taking into account this",
    "nonequilibrium dynamics is the rqmd model @xcite . to extend the relativistic transport model to heavy - ion collisions at these energies ,",
    "we have used as initial conditions the hadron abundance and distributions obtained from the string fragmentation in rqmd .",
    "further interactions and decays of these ` primary ' hadrons are then taken into account as in usual relativistic transport model .",
    "we include non - strange baryons with masses below 1.72 gev , as well as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for mesons",
    "we include @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 , as well as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "baryons are propagated in their mean fields , which are assumed to be the same for all non - strange baryons .",
    "the mean fields for hyperons are assumed to be 2/3 of that for non - strange baryons , based on the simple quark counting rule .",
    "medium effects on pions and phi mesons are neglected , while those on kaons are always included , with their mean fields taken to be 1/3 of these for nucleons . for other non - strange mesons ,",
    "we consider two scenarios as in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , one with medium effects and one without medium effects . in our model , these mesons are treated in the constituent quark model .",
    "they thus feel only the scalar potential that shifts their masses , since the vector potential on the ( constiutent ) quark is canceled by that on the ( constituent ) antiquark .",
    "in addition to propagation in mean fields , hadrons also under stochastic two - body collisions . for baryon - baryon interactions , we include both elastic and inelastic scattering for nucleons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "their cross sections are either taken from refs .",
    "@xcite or obtained using the detailed balance procedure @xcite .",
    "the meson - baryon interactions are modeled by baryon resonace formation and decay .",
    "for example , the interaction of a pion with a nucleon proceeds through the formation and decay of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... , n(1720 ) .",
    "the formation cross sections are taken to be of the relativistic breit - wigner form .",
    "the meson - meson interactions are either formulated by the resonance formation and decay when the intermediate meson is explicitly included in our model or treated as a direct elastic scattering with a cross section estimated from various theoretical models .",
    "of particular importance for photon production are the pion - pion and pion - rho collisions , which are dominated by rho and @xmath5 meson formation , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the observed enhancement of low - mass dileptons in heavy - ion collisions can be explained by including dropping vector meson masses .",
    "it is useful to see whether the inclusion of the dropping vector meson mass is also consistent with the real photon data from the wa80 collaboration . for this purpose",
    "we will also calculate photon spectra in the scenario of dropping meson masses . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we extend the walecka model from the coupling of nucleons to scalar and vector fields to the coupling of light quarks to these fields , using the ideas of the meson - quark coupling model @xcite . for a system of nucleons , pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons , and axial - vector mesons at temperature @xmath20 and baryon density @xmath21 , the scalar field @xmath22 is determined self - consistently from @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 0.45g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\eta^*\\over e_\\eta ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\eta ^*/t)-1}+ { 6g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\rho^*\\over e_\\rho ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\rho ^*/t)-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 2g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\omega^*\\over e_\\omega ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\omega ^*/t)-1 } + { 6\\sqrt 2 g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_{a_1}^*\\over e_{a_1}^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_{a_1}^*/t)-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the constituent quark model relations for the nucleon and vector meson masses @xcite , i.e. , @xmath24 , the quark structure of the @xmath1 meson in free space which leads to @xmath25 , and the weinberg sum rule relation between the rho - meson and @xmath5 meson masses , i.e , @xmath26 .",
    "recently we found that the use of a refined model , the effective chiral lagrangian of @xcite , leads to essentially the same results for dilepton spectra @xcite .",
    "this model describes the hadron observables quite well . in fig .",
    "1 we show the pseudorapidity distribtion of charged particles ( upper window ) and transverse momentum spectra of pions ( lower window ) for central s+au collisions .",
    "they are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data from the wa80 @xcite and the ceres collaboration @xcite .",
    "comparisons with other hadron observables , such as proton rapidity distribution and transverse mass spectra can be found in ref .",
    "the majority of single photons come from the decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at freeze out .",
    "the background photon spectra from their decay can thus be evaluated at the end of the transport model simulation by using the following branching ratio @xcite @xmath27    for the ` thermal ' photon spectra we include the decay of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 mesons , the decay of all the baryon resonances in our model , as well as two - body processes such as @xmath28 and @xmath8 .",
    "the decay widths for @xmath29 and @xmath30 are taken from @xcite , which explains the measured width for @xmath31 .",
    "the mass dependence of these widths are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the open circle gives the experimental data for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that in transport models , rho mesons can have different masses because of its broad mass distribution , so mass dependent widths are used .",
    "the omega meson radiative decay width @xmath32 was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the chiral lagrangian that includes the wess - zumino anomalous term .",
    "the width was found to be proportional to the pion momentum in the @xmath3 rest frame , namely , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the coefficient @xmath35 is determined from the measured width @xcite .",
    "there exists only one experimental measurement of the @xmath5 radiative decay width , using the reverse process of @xmath5 production in pion - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "the width is found to be @xmath36 , which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite in calculating @xmath5 contribution to photon production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an effective lagrangian was proposed to calculate this width , which turns out to be about 1.4 mev using the vector dominance assumption .",
    "this is close to the prediction of non - relativistic quark model of about 1.0 - 1.6 mev @xcite . in view of large uncertainties",
    ", we use @xmath37 mev as in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit that pion momentum is much greater than its mass , the @xmath5 radiative decay width is given by @xmath38 where the coefficient @xmath35 is determined by using @xmath37 mev .",
    "photons can also be produced from the decay of baryon resonaces .",
    "these contributions are usually neglected in hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay widths for baryon resonances included in our transport model have been measured experimentally through photon - nucleon and/or pion - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "we use these widths in our calculation of their contributions to single photon spectra .",
    "in addition , @xmath39 decay dominantly into @xmath40 .",
    "but since the mass difference between @xmath39 and @xmath9 is not very large , photons from @xmath39 decay usually have low transverse momenta , as will be shown below .    for contributions from two - body processes ,",
    "we include @xmath6 and @xmath8 , which are the most important ones in the temperature region relevant for sps energies @xcite .",
    "these cross sections were first evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite , with an effective lagragian including @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons , which will be used in the present work .",
    "the cross section for @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , for three different rho meson masses .",
    "as the rho meson mass is reduced , the threshold and also the magnitude of the cross section are reduced . the cross section for @xmath8",
    "is shown in fig . 5 for three different rho meson mass . when the rho meson mass is reduced , the available center - of - mass energy is reduced and the cross section increases .",
    "the importance of the @xmath5 meson was investigated in refs .",
    "since in our transport model the processes @xmath41 and @xmath42 are explictly included , we need not to include the effects of @xmath5 on the direct @xmath8 process . otherwise there will be double counting .",
    "the effects of the @xmath5 on @xmath6 were found to be appreciable for photons with energies greater than about 0.5 gev @xcite .",
    "the contributions of @xmath6 to these ` hard ' photons are , however , extremely small ( about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those from @xmath8 ) .",
    "this justifies our use of the cross sections given in ref .",
    "@xcite that did not include the @xmath5 meson in the model .",
    "we present in this section the single photon spectra in central s+au collisions at 200 agev .",
    "the acceptance of the wa80 collaboration is taken into account , namely , we include photons with pseudo - rapidity of @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "6 we show the background photon spectra from the decay of @xmath0 ( dotted line ) and @xmath1 meson ( dashed line ) . it is seen that contribution from @xmath0 decay far dominates the background .    the contributions to the so - called ` thermal ' photons from the decay of mesons and baryons , and from two - body scattering are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath3 radiative decay is found to be the most important source for photons with transverse momenta above about 0.5 gev .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite , although our results are somewhat larger than those of ref .",
    "this difference might be traced back to the difference in the ` primary ' @xmath3 meson abundances in the rqmd and the hsd models .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath5 radiative decay is comparable to that from direct @xmath8 .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that including @xmath5 the @xmath44 contribution increases by about a factor 2 - 3 in the relevant temperature and photon energy region .",
    "the contributions from @xmath4 and @xmath39 radiative decays are restricted to photons with transverse momenta below 0.5 gev , because the mass differences between hadrons in the intial and final states in these processes are small .",
    "photons with transverse momenta below 0.2 gev come chiefly from the decay of @xmath45 and @xmath46 scattering .",
    "the reaction @xmath6 is endothermic , with most of the available energy going into the rho meson mass .",
    "this cross section actually diverges as the photon energy goes to zero .",
    "we have included a low - energy cut - off as in ref .",
    "the choice of this cut - off parameter affects basically only the photons with transverse momenta below about 0.1 gev , where no experimental data are available .    in fig .",
    "8 we compare our results with the upper bound of the wa80 collaboration .",
    "more than 80% of thermal photons come from meson decay , of which more than half come from the @xmath3 radiative decay .",
    "overall , our results are well below the wa80 upper bound for photons with transverse momenta below 1 gev . for higher tranverse momenta , our results touch the upper bound of the experimental data .",
    "our results are actually very close to those of ref .",
    "@xcite with the parameter set named eos h , that includes about the same number of hadron degrees of freedom as in our model .",
    "the conclusion is thus that the wa80 single photon data do not necessary imply the formation quark gluon plasma .",
    "of course , the possibility of quark gluon plasma formation is not ruled out .",
    "next we discuss the results obtained with in - medium meson masses .",
    "the separate contributions from the decay of mesons and baryons , and two - body processes are shown in fig .",
    "9 . there is not much change in the meson and baryon decay contributions . with dropping meson masses , the abundances of @xmath2 and @xmath5",
    "mesons increase @xcite .",
    "this is , however , compensated by the decreases in their radiative decay widths ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the comparison of total thermal photon spectra with the experimental data is given in fig .",
    "10 . in the case of dropping meson masses",
    ", our results do not exceed the upper bound of the wa80 data .    finally , in fig .",
    "11 we show the ratio of total ( sum of thermal and background ) photon to the background photon . in both and free meson mass and in - medium meson mass cases , the thermal photon accounts for less than 5% of all the single photons , in agreement with the experimental observation , and the simple estimation by tserruya in ref",
    "an important difference between dilepton and real photon measurements is that in the former case , the contamination from @xmath47 can , in principle , be removed since these dileptons are restricted to masses below @xmath48 , while in the real photon case , the @xmath49 contributes to photons with any momentum .",
    "the subtraction of the background , and hence the measurement of interesting signals , are much more subtle in the real photon case @xcite .",
    "the wa80 single photon data have been looked at by several groups , mostly based on hydrodynamical models @xcite here we compare our results that are based on the relativistic transport model with some of these results . in fig .",
    "12 , we show our results together with those from @xcite and @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite different equations of state with and without quark gluon plasma formation were considered . shown in the figure by dotted line",
    "is their results based on eos h. this equation of state included about the same number of hadron degrees of freedom as in our transport model .",
    "it is very interesting to see that their results are very similar to ours , although the dynamical models used are quite different . in ref . @xcite",
    "two different equations of state , one with quark gluon plasma formation and one with pure pionic gas , were considered . shown in the figure",
    "is their results based on the pionic gas equation of state .",
    "because of very limited number of hadronic degrees of freedom in this equation of state , they needed a very high initial temperature to account for the final observed hadron abundances .",
    "this led to large photon yield .    in refs .",
    "studied photon as well as dilepton production at sps energy based on the master equation formalism .",
    "they have considered two scenarios , one with pions only and the other includes nucleon as well . in order to make a fair comparison , we show in the upper window of fig .",
    "13 the photon spectra obtained in our calculation with the decays of @xmath2 and @xmath5 and two - body processes of @xmath6 and @xmath50 , and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite excluding nucleons .",
    "we can see that their results are very similar to ours . in the lower part of fig .",
    "13 we compare our results including baryon resonance decay with those of ref .",
    "@xcite that included nucleon effects .",
    "the results are again quite consistent with ours .",
    "note that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite is very sensitive to the initial nucleon density .",
    "the results shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "13 were obtained with an initial nucleon density @xmath51 , which is quite appropriate for s+au collisions at sps energies .",
    "in summary , we studied single photon spectra in central s+au collisions at sps energies using the relativistic transport model that has been used to study dilepton spectra in the same reactions .",
    "we included photons from the background sources of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , as well as thermal sources such as meson decays , decays of baryon resonances , and two - body processes .",
    "we found that more than 95% of single photons come from the decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the thermal photons account for only less than 5% of all single photons , in agreement with the experimental observation made by the wa80 and ceres collaborations .",
    "we compared our thermal photon spectra with the experimental upper bound extracted by the wa80 collaboration .",
    "it is seen that in both the free meson mass and in - medium meson mass cases , our results do not exceed the experimental upper bound .",
    "this indicates that our model can explain both the enhancement of low - mass dileptons and the lack of signal in the real photon measurement .",
    "our results are also in agreement with the conclusions of hydrodynamical calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite that included a sufficient number of hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore the wa80 single photon data do not necessary imply the phase transition to the quark gluon plasma , as claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite based on a limited number of hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , we note that the elementary radiative decay widths and photon prodcution cross sections used in this study have been taken from different models . in principle , most of them can be evaluated consistently within the same model , such as the hidden gauge theory of @xcite . in this model",
    ", one can also study the effects of the change of gauge coupling constant on photon production in hot and dense matter .",
