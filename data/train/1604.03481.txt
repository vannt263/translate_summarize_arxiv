    "the past two decades have seen very intense research efforts on the band - gap engineering in the synthetic semiconducting systems .",
    "thanks to the development of epitaxial - growth technology and electron lithography , this field has created an excellent example of how the fundamental science and technology can interact and influence one another .",
    "we refer , in particular , to the exotic physics emerging from the semiconducting quasi - n - dimensional electron systems ( qndes ) ; with @xmath0 [ @xmath1 2 , 1 , or 0 ] being the degree of freedom . while the seeds of the qndes were sown much earlier [ 1 ] , the discovery of quantum hall effects is known to have induced the titanic research interest to see the consequent changes with diminishing system s dimensions from 3 to 2 , 2 to 1 , and 1 to 0 .",
    "these are becoming known as quantum wells , quantum wires , and quantum dots in which the charge carriers exposed to electric and/or magnetic fields can [ and do ] reveal novel quantal effects that strongly modify the behavior characteristics of the resulting devices .",
    "the urge for such miniaturization lies in the current quest for potentially _ smaller _ and _ faster _ devices .",
    "a comprehensive review of the electronic , optical , and transport phenomena in the quantum structures of reduced dimensionality can be found in ref . [ 2 ] .",
    "what makes these qndes so much attractive are the smaller effective masses of the charge carriers and ( substantially ) large ( background ) dielectric constants . as a result ,",
    "the charge carriers in semiconductors are more responsive to minute compositional changes or small perturbations  a situation that is exploited for device applications and for making model systems unattainable with free particles .",
    "the quantum size effects arise when the dimensions of a system become comparable to the de - broglie wavelength [ @xmath2 10 nm ] .",
    "these are the crucial factors that spurred the fabrication of quantum wells , wires , and dots with the same fundamental principle : confine the electrons in a semiconductor with a smaller band - gap sandwiched between two identical semiconductors with a larger band - gap  a measure of the amount of energy needed to be pumped into the material to get electrons flowing .",
    "thus an ultra thin layer with free charge carriers forms the q2d quantum well ; a narrow strip sliced from the q2d layer makes a q1d quantum wire ; and dicing up a q1d wire yields q0d quantum dot .    by controlling the size and dimensions of such qndes",
    ", researchers can tailor the electronic , optical , and transport properties of a device at will . in theory ,",
    "the fewer the dimension , the finer the tuning , the sharper the clustering of energy states around specific peaks , and more important the many - body effects .",
    "in addition , the reduced degrees of freedom allow detailed and often exact calculations .",
    "the condensed matter physicists still fondly remember the excitement that followed the original proposals for designing the quantum wells [ 3 ] , quantum wires [ 4 ] , and quantum dots [ 5 ] .",
    "if recent history ( of past 20 years ) is any guide , it may not be an exaggeration to state that the vast majority of the condensed matter physicists  theorists and experimentalists  are still overwhelmingly fascinated by these low - dimensional , quantum structures .",
    "it seems to be true no matter if they name it the spintronics , topological insulators , graphene , silicene , or germanene .",
    "the ability of these nanostructures to turn the broad energy bands of the parent semiconductors into sharply defined energy levels is a transformation that promises greater speed and efficiency for the resulting electronic and optical devices .    ever increasing interest in these quantum structures",
    "is ascribed not only to their potential applications but also to the fundamental physics involved [ 2 ] .",
    "for instance , the q2des ( or quantum wells and superlattices ) allow the researchers a crystal clear observation of the bloch oscillations , unobservable in the conventional solids .",
    "the q1des ( or quantum wires and lateral superlattices ) offer us an excellent , unique opportunity to study the real 1d fermi gases in a relatively controlled manner .",
    "the q0des ( or quantum dots or antidots ) allow us a testing ground for studying the electron - electron interactions in a , neat and clean , tiny laboratory within the so - called artificial atoms .",
    "scientists have approached the fabrication of quantum dots from two very different points of view : ( i ) a top - down approach in which the extent and dimensionality of the solid has gradually been reduced , and ( ii ) a bottom - up in which quantum dots are viewed as extremely large molecules or colloids .",
    "the quantum dots grown by epitaxial and lithographic techniques are in the size regime from 1 @xmath3 m down to 10 nm , whereas the colloidal samples vary in diameter from the truly molecular regime of 1 nm to about 20 nm .",
    "the latter systems are also known in the literature by the names of colloidal quantum dots or nanocrystals .",
    "the spherical quantum dots ( sqds ) , which are the subject matter of the present work , are precisely the systems that belong to this family of systems and are playing better responsive role as lasers than their epitaxial - cum - lithographic counterparts .",
    "the research interest burgeoned in sqds has focused mostly on the excitonic aspects of the bulk part with the surface states , generally , eliminated by enclosure in a material of larger band - gap [ 6 - 35 ] . existing research work",
    "has devoted to understanding diverse fundamental properties of sqds related with the exciton dynamics .",
    "these include the distribution of electrons and holes , exciton formation , exciton binding energy , exciton absorption , recombination , impact ionization , carrier multiplication , direct and indirect transitions , exciton spin dynamics , optical non - linearity , oscillator strength , and excitonic atoms  to name a few  in the theoretical [ 6 - 14 , 17 , 19 , 21 - 22 , 24 - 28 , 30 - 35 ] and experimental [ 15 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 29 ] works .",
    "theoretical models employed for this purpose involve the tight - binding , effective - mass approximation , variational approach , perturbative scheme , finite - element , pseudopotential , and the kane s @xmath4 model in the systems of cds , cdse , pbte / cdte , and inas / gaas ; and considering the effect of an applied magnetic field [ 13 , 17 , 19 - 21 , 34 ] , the temperature dependence [ 23 ] , the phonon effects [ 25 ] , the coulomb impurities [ 30 ] , and the surface effect [ 32 ] .",
    "singular in the list of references is the ref .",
    "35 in which the authors have studied the sqds made up of 3d topological insulator ( ti ) materials , such as pbte / pb@xmath5sn@xmath6te , with bound massless and helical weyl states existing at the interface .",
    "the authors demonstrate a complete confinement of the massless weyl fermions at the interface and identify the spin locking and the kramers degeneracy , the hallmarks of a 3d ti .",
    "they argue that the semiclassical faraday effect [ due to the pauli exclusion principle ] can be used to read out spin quantum memory in the optically mediated quantum computing .",
    "it is captivating given the ongoing excitement behind the quantum computation and the advocacy of comparing the electronic , spintronic , and optical processing of information .",
    "the scrutiny of the existing literature on the spherical quantum dots reveals the lack of genuine efforts devoted to theorizing the magneto - optical absorption that generally justifies the ( localized ) plasmon excitation peaks observed in the optical experiments .",
    "the present paper is motivated to fill that gap .",
    "we consider a sqd characterized by a confining harmonic potential and an applied magnetic field in the symmetry gauge .",
    "we believe that the harmonic potential confining the sqds is the most reasonable approximation justifiable for the situation when the number of electrons ( @xmath0 ) in the dots is small .",
    "this model of harmonic potential validates the kohn s theorem [ 36 ] ",
    "generalized to q0des [ 37 ]  which states that the fir resonant spectrum of a correlated many - electron system is insensitive to the interaction effects .",
    "identical physical conditions ( of confinement and magnetic field ) yield consistent results even in relatively more sophisticated ( spintronic ) qndes [ 38 - 40 ] .",
    "as such , we employ the bohm - pines full - fledged random - phase approximation ( rpa ) [ 41 ] and derive the total [ or interacting ] density - density correlation function ( ddcf ) in terms of the dyson equation that takes proper account of the coulomb interactions . to this end",
    ", we make use of the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies obtained as the solutions of the relevant schrodinger equation in the spherical geometry . as an application of the analytical results , we compute the fock - darwin spectrum [ 42 - 44 ] , the magneto - optical absorption , the fermi energy , and the radial distribution for electrons .",
    "the finiteness of the sqd is accounted for by matching a proper boundary condition : the total eigenfunction vanishes at the surface of the quantum dot . in the illustrative examples we stress upon the dependence on the dot - size , the confining potential , and the magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the theoretical framework within the rpa that allows us to derive the total ddcf in terms of the dyson equation embodying properly the coulomb interactions , to devise the selection rules for the magneto - optical transitions , to compute the fermi energy , and to discuss the radial distribution of electrons . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss several illustrative examples of , e.g. , the fock - darwin spectrum , fermi energy , magneto - optical absorption , optical transitions , and radial distribution of electrons .",

    "of course , this is undesirable and therefore we want to get rid of it . the best strategy is to take the matrix elements of the whole ( _ radial _ ) equation between the states @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "<S> semiconducting quantum dots  more fancifully dubbed artificial atoms  are quasi - zero dimensional , tiny , man - made systems with charge carriers _ completely _ confined in all three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the scientific quest behind the synthesis of quantum dots is to create and control future electronic and optical nanostructures engineered through tailoring size , shape , and composition . </S>",
    "<S> the _ complete _ confinement  or the lack of any degree of freedom for the electrons ( and/or holes )  in quantum dots limits the exploration of _ spatially localized _ elementary excitations such as plasmons to _ direct _ rather than _ reciprocal _ space . here </S>",
    "<S> we embark on a thorough investigation of the magneto - optical absorption in semiconducting _ spherical _ quantum dots characterized by a confining harmonic potential and an applied magnetic field in the symmetric gauge . </S>",
    "<S> this is done within the framework of bohm - pines random - phase approximation that enables us to derive and discuss the full dyson equation that takes proper account of the coulomb interactions . as an application of our theoretical strategy , </S>",
    "<S> we compute various single - particle and many - particle phenomena such as the fock - darwin spectrum ; fermi energy ; magneto - optical transitions ; probability distribution ; and the magneto - optical absorption in the quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the role of an applied magnetic field on the absorption spectrum is comparable to that of a confining potential . increasing ( decreasing ) the strength of the magnetic field or the confining potential </S>",
    "<S> is found to be analogous to shrinking ( expanding ) the size of the quantum dots : resulting into a blue ( red ) shift in the absorption spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy diminishes with both increasing magnetic - field and dot - size ; and exhibits saw - tooth - like oscillations at large values of field or dot - size . unlike laterally confined quantum dots , both ( upper and lower ) magneto - optical transitions survive even in the extreme instances . </S>",
    "<S> however , the intra - landau level transitions are seen to be forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical quantum dots have an edge over the strictly two - dimensional quantum dots in that the additional ( magnetic ) quantum number makes the physics richer ( but complex ) . </S>",
    "<S> a deeper grasp of the coulomb blockade , quantum coherence , and entanglement can lead to a better insight into promising applications involving lasers , detectors , storage devices , and quantum computing . </S>"
