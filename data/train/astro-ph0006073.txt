    "the problem of thermal conduction in a stochastic magnetic field is crucial for our understanding of galaxy cluster formation ( suginohara & ostriker 1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ) and for the theory of cooling flows ( fabian 1990 ) .",
    "it is also of great interest for the solar physics and for various questions of plasma physics . at the same time , the question : `` whether electron thermal conduction is so strongly inhibited by a stochastic magnetic field in a galaxy cluster , that it can be neglected '' , is a very controversial one ( rosner & tucker 1989 ; tribble 1989 ; tao 1995 ; pistinner & shaviv 1996 ; chandran & cowley 1998 ) . it is currently estimated that if the coefficient of thermal conductivity is less than @xmath1 of the spitzer value , then the time scale of the heat conduction in the cluster is more than the hubble time ( suginohara & ostriker 1998 ) .",
    "otherwise , thermal conduction is important[footnote ] .   of the spitzer value , is based on numerical simulations with limited resolution , so it is not the last word on the problem . ]",
    "the problem of thermal diffusion of heat conducting electrons in a stochastic magnetic field should be divided into two separate parts because there are two separate effects that reduce diffusion in the presence of stochastic magnetic field ( pistinner & shaviv 1996 ; chandran , cowley , & ivanushkina 1999 ) .",
    "the first effect is that the heat conducting electrons have to travel along tangled magnetic field lines , and as a result , they have to go larger distances between hot and cold regions of space .",
    "( in other words , the temperature gradients are weaker along magnetic field lines . )",
    "the second effect is that electrons , while they are traveling along the field lines , become trapped and detrapped between magnetic mirrors ( which are regions of strong magnetic field ) .",
    "a trapped electron is reflected back and forth between magnetic mirrors until collisions make its pitch angle sufficiently small for the electron to escape the magnetic trap .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the second effect , and we derive the reduction of the effective electron thermal conduction parallel to the magnetic field lines caused by the presence of stochastic magnetic mirrors .",
    "as is well known , a temperature gradient produces electrical current as well as heat flow .",
    "similarly , an electric field produces heat flow as well as current .",
    "the four transport coefficients describing this are given in equation  ( [ j ] ) and  ( [ q ] ) .",
    "the transport coefficients were first calculated by spitzer & h@xmath2rm for an unmagnetized plasma ( spitzer & h@xmath2rm 1953 ; cohen , spitzer & routly 1950 ) .",
    "their coefficients also apply in an uniform magnetic field for transport parallel to the field . in this paper , we show how the parallel transport coefficients can be reduced in the presence of stochastic magnetic mirrors , and we calculate their reduced values by the same kinetic approach as that of spitzer & h@xmath2rm .",
    "the reduction factors are presented in figure  [ fig_transport ] . the reduced effective thermal conductivity ( that resulting when the electric field is present to cancel the current )",
    "is given in figure  [ fig_conduction ] .",
    "spatial diffusivity of mono - energetic electrons along the magnetic field lines is also presented in figure  [ fig_d / d_0 ] .",
    "first , in section  [ escape ] , we solve the kinetic equation to find the escape time @xmath3 for electrons trapped between two equal magnetic mirrors .",
    "we assume , that all electrons have a single value of speed , @xmath4 , i.e.  they are mono - energetic .",
    "the exact calculations of the escape time are given in appendices  [ a_case_1 ] and  [ a_cases_2_3 ] .",
    "in addition , we carry out monte - carlo particle simulations to confirm our results .",
    "second , in section  [ diffusion ] , we apply our results for this escape time to find the reduction of diffusion of mono - energetic electrons in a system of stochastic mirrors .",
    "it turns out that in the limit @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnetic field decorrelation length and @xmath7 is the electron mean free path , the parallel diffusivity is unaffected by magnetic mirrors , and is given by the standard value @xmath8 . in the opposite limit , @xmath9 , magnetic mirrors do reduce diffusivity .",
    "we find that in this case there is a subset of the mirrors , the principle mirrors , that inhibits diffusion the most .",
    "these are mirrors whose separation distances are approximately equal to the electron _ effective mean free path _ , @xmath10 , the typical distance that electrons travel in the loss cones before they are scattered out of them .",
    "in order to estimate the reduction of diffusion in this limit , we need consider only the principle mirrors , neglecting all others .",
    "again , we perform the numerical simulations to support these theoretical results .    third , in section  [ equation ] , in order to carry out a precise kinetic treatment involving all electrons , we consider the diffusion reduction to be equivalent to an enhancement of the pitch angle scattering rate of electrons . in deriving the collision integral ,",
    "we , therefore , modify the pitch angle scattering term by the inverse of the factor by which the spatial diffusion is reduced .",
    "we take into account the full perturbed electron - electron collision integral , as well as the electron - proton collision term .",
    "we obtain an integro - differential equation for the perturbed electron distribution function in the presence of stochastic magnetic mirrors .",
    "if there is no reduction of electron diffusivity , our equation reduces to the well known result obtained by spitzer and h@xmath2rm ( spitzer & h@xmath2rm 1953 ; cohen , spitzer & routly 1950 ; spitzer 1962 ) .",
    "fourth , in section  [ transport ] , we solve our equation numerically , separately for the lorentz gas in the presence of magnetic mirrors , neglecting electron - electron collisions ( in this case the equation simplifies greatly ) , and for the spitzer gas in the presence of magnetic mirrors .",
    "we find the reductions of the four plasma transport coefficients and of the effective thermal conductivity as functions of the ratio of the magnetic field decorrelation length @xmath6 to the electron mean free path at the thermal speed @xmath0 ( this mean free path is different for the lorentz and spitzer models ) .",
    "we find that the major effect of the magnetic mirrors is the reduction of anisotropy of superthermal electrons ( this anisotropy is driven by a temperature gradient or / and by an electric field ) .",
    "electrical current and heat are mainly transported by these electrons , whose diffusivity is suppressed the most .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and give the conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we solve the kinetic equation to find the escape time @xmath3 for electrons trapped between two equal magnetic mirrors . we assume here and in the next section that all electrons have a single value of speed , @xmath4 , which is unchanged by collisions , i.e.  electrons are mono - energetic . in order to derive an analytical solution , we make several additional simplifying assumptions .",
    "let the two magnetic barriers ( mirrors ) be both equal to @xmath11 , and we assume the magnetic field @xmath12 is constant between them . we introduce the _ mirror strength _",
    "the separation of the mirrors is @xmath14 , and their thicknesses are negligible compared to @xmath14 . in other words , magnetic mirrors are similar to thin step - functions with heights @xmath15 and with constant field @xmath12 between them ( see figure  [ fig_mirrors ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , because as we will see in the next section , electron diffusion is controlled by strong mirrors with mirror strengths @xmath16 , which are separated by distances much larger than the magnetic field decorrelation length ( if the spectrum of mirrors falls off with their strength significantly faster than @xmath17 , the case that we consider in this paper ) .    under these assumptions ,",

    "we solve equation  ( [ kinetic_eq ] ) for case ( 1 ) in appendix  [ a_case_1 ] and for cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in appendix  [ a_cases_2_3 ] , and we obtain the electron escape times    lcll _",

    "[ tau_case ] the following simple physical arguments help to understand these results in these three limiting cases . the collisional scattering is a two - dimensional random walk of a unit vector ( which is the direction of the electron velocity ) on a surface of a unit - radius sphere with frequency @xmath23 ( so , the scattered angle @xmath38 after time interval @xmath20 ) .",
    "the right hand side of the kinetic equation  ( [ full_kinetic_eq ] ) represents a one - dimensional random walk in @xmath39-space that follows from the two - dimensional walk because of symmetry .",
    "however , it is convenient for the moment to return to the original two - dimensional scattering because it is isotropic .",
    "the angular sizes of the two loss cones on the unit - radius sphere are @xmath40 .",
    "first , in the limit @xmath41 , collisions are very weak , and the scattered angle over the travel time between mirrors , @xmath42 , is @xmath43 .",

    "because the unit vector can `` visit '' each box more than once , the exact result contains the logarithm of @xmath33 .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath48 , we have to consider motion in @xmath19-space as well .",
    "in this case the electrons move in three - dimensional phase space , and they escape when they are in the two loss cones within distance @xmath10 from the mirrors , as shown by the shaded regions in figure  [ fig_mirrors](b ) .",

    "note , that the electron distribution function is almost constant in the phase space in this case ( see appendix  [ a_cases_2_3 ] ) .",
    "third , in the limit @xmath37 , the escape of electrons is controlled by slow diffusion in @xmath19-space , so the escape time is approximately equal to the time of diffusion between mirrors , @xmath52 in this case .    in our further calculations we use a simple interpolation formula _ m_m^(1)+_m^(2)+_m^(3)= ^-1[tau ] for the whole range of parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "we then carry out calculations similar to those we used in formulas  ( [ a_cases_2_3_flux_1 ] ) and  ( [ a_cases_2_3_flux_2 ] ) to find that @xmath238 [ the second line in equation  ( [ tau_case ] ) ] .",
    "let us , for simplicity , consider the lorentz gas .",
    "the results for the spitzer gas are similar .",
    "first , we derive an estimate for the additional flow @xmath250 of electrons that are in an interval @xmath251 of the velocity space , produced by an electric field @xmath122 due to the change of the two loss cones of a mirror trap .",
    "let us consider only the principle mirrors , because they mainly control the diffusion of electrons ( see section  [ diffusion ] ) . in this appendix ,",
    "we denote their mirror strength ( the principle mirror strength ) as @xmath252 .",
    "the principle mirror strength is of order of five , so in the case when the magnetic field decorrelation length is more than or approximately equal to the electron mean free path , @xmath253 , the escape of electrons from the mirror trap is mainly controlled by their spatial diffusion , see section  [ escape ] .",
    "thus , in this limit , the electrons `` do not care '' about the size of the loss cones , and therefore , no additional flow arises .    in the case",
    "@xmath254 there is a non - zero additional flow @xmath250 . in figure  [ fig_mirrors](b ) , because of the electric field , the loss cone on the left , @xmath255 , is not equal to that on the right , @xmath256 .",
    "the size of the two loss cones is estimated from the conservation of the electron magnetic moment , @xmath257 , and from the conservation of energy , @xmath258 .",
    "we have _ crit,^21 - 1/m(eel_m / m_ev^2 m ) , [ a_e_fluxes_mu ] where @xmath259 is the spacing of the principle mirrors .",
    "let @xmath260 and @xmath261 be the absolute values of the fluxes of the escaping electrons to the right and to the left respectively .",
    "then , their sum is d_++d_-=(l_m/_m)2v^2f_0dv , [ a_e_fluxes_f_sum ] where @xmath262 is the number density of electrons expressed in terms of the maxwellian zero order electron distribution function @xmath112 , and @xmath263 is the escape time , see equations  ( [ f_time_dependent ] ) ,  ( [ tau ] ) ,  ( [ maxwell ] ) and section  [ escape ] .",
    "the actual electron flow , @xmath250 , is equal to the difference of @xmath260 and @xmath261 , because they are in opposite directions .",
    "an estimate for the ratio @xmath264 is = ./. [ a_e_fluxes_ratio ] now , using equations  ( [ a_e_fluxes_mu])([a_e_fluxes_ratio ] ) , we obtain the additional electron flow d-2(ee / m_e)f_0(l_m^2/_m)dv .",
    "the factor @xmath265 in this equation is proportional to the spatial diffusivity of the electrons ( provided that the diffusivity is controlled by the principle mirrors , see section  [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "thus , it is obviously @xmath266 , where @xmath267 and @xmath268 are the standard lorentz mean free path and collision frequency , and @xmath109 is the reduction of the spatial diffusivity reported in section  [ diffusion ] . using that @xmath269 , @xmath270 , and equations  ( [ maxwell ] ) ,  ( [ lambda_l_t ] ) , @xmath0",
    ", we finally obtain d-(1/2)(2/)^3/2(.k^3/2t^3/2e / m_e^1/2e^3 ) r_d^5e^-^2 d. [ a_e_fluxes_flux ]    now we like to compare this result for the additional flow @xmath250 with the main flow @xmath271 produced by the electric field due to acceleration of particles .",
    "the later is df=_-1 ^ 1vf_1d2v^2dvd=-(2/3)(2/)^3/2(.k^3/2t^3/2e / m_e^1/2e^3 ) r_d^7e^-^2 d , where we substituted function @xmath126 given by  ( [ f_1 ] ) , and function @xmath272 given by  ( [ gamma_t_e ] ) and  ( [ lorentz_s ] ) . as a result ,",
    "d / df(3/4)^-2 . because the electrical current and the heat flow are mainly transported by superthermal electrons @xmath273 , the additional flow produced by electric field due to non - equal loss cones",
    "can indeed be neglected in comparison with the main flow due to acceleration of electrons by electric field ."
