    "applying some dispersive estimates of strichartz type , we ensure the approximate stabilization of an arbitrary eigenfunction in the discrete part of the spectrum .",

    "this will be treated in section  [ sec : relax ] .",
    "from now on , we will assume that the system is initially prepared in a purely discrete state : @xmath123 where @xmath124 ( resp .",
    "@xmath125 ) denotes @xmath126 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 ) . the control task is to steer the systems state in the eigenspace corresponding to an eigenfunction @xmath65 of the free hamiltonian .",

    "the feedback law will be given by  @xcite : @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the imaginary part of a complex number .",
    "a deep analysis based on lasalle type arguments shows that with such a feedback strategy , one can not avoid phenomenons like mass lost at infinity .",
    "the population of the state @xmath65 will surely keep increasing during the evolution .",
    "but , in order to be able to apply the lasalle invariance principle for such infinite dimensional system , one needs to ensure the pre - compactness of the trajectories in @xmath49 . in the particular case , of the schrdinger equation with the decaying potential , considered in this paper and with the feedback law  , one can not even hope to have such a pre - compactness result . indeed , as it has been said before , while the population of the state @xmath65 keeps increasing through the application of the feedback law  , during this same period some of the population might go through the continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "this population has then the possibility to disperse rapidly ( cf . subsection  [ ssec : decay ] ) and so we might have some un - controlled part of the @xmath105-norm which will be lost at infinity .",
    "the approach of this paper consists in avoiding the population to go through the continuum while stabilizing the state around the target state @xmath65 .",
    "so , we consider a lyapunov function @xmath132 which encodes these both tasks : @xmath133 is a small positive constant .",
    "such a lyapunov function clearly verifies : @xmath134 here still , we have used the fact that @xmath46 and @xmath135 s are all normalized in @xmath49 . moreover , as the system is initially prepared in the discrete part of the spectrum , and as @xmath136 , @xmath137 this lyapunov function clearly encodes two tasks : 1- it prevents the @xmath105-mass lost through the dispersion of the absolutely continuous population ; 2- it privileges the increase of the population in the eigenfunction @xmath65 .    by a simple computation we have , @xmath138.\\ ] ]",
    "a natural choice is therefore to consider the feedback law : @xmath139,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is a positive constant .",
    "such a feedback law clearly ensures the decrease of the lyapunov function @xmath141 .",
    "looking at the structure of the lyapunov function  , the feedback law   penalizes strongly exiting from the discrete part of the spectrum . actually , as @xmath142 , the decrease in this lyapunov function ensures that the population in the discrete part of the spectrum will always remain more than @xmath143 .",
    "therefore in the worst case , we will only have an @xmath144 @xmath105-norm which will be lost by dispersing in the continuum .    at the same time",
    ", this feedback law   slightly encourages the increase in the population of the target state @xmath65 .",
    "it remains therefore to check whether this increase actually provides some kind of convergence toward this eigenfunction or not .",
