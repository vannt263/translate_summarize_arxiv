    "the infrared luminosity - line width relation ( hereafter irtf ) has been studied conventionally using the @xmath1-band synthetic aperture magnitude denoted as @xmath3 ( aaronson et al 1986 , pierce & tully 1988 , freedman 1990 , sakai et al 2000 )",
    ". originally introduced by aaronson , mould & huchra ( 1979 ) , the @xmath3 magnitude was defined as the flux observed within an aperture having a diameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stands for the optical isophotal diameter measured at the surface brightness level of @xmath13magarcsec@xmath14 . based on this rather heterogeneous magnitude system , the @xmath1-band irtf has been a peculiar one compared with the optical tfs which are all based on the ordinary surface photometric magnitudes ( e.g. , giovanelli et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "the @xmath3 system was originally contrived from an observational limitation that a 2-d imager was not available in the infrared wavelength domain . even after the advent of an infrared 2-d imager",
    ", its physical size had been insufficient for accurate surface photometry . in the meanwhile homogeneous data sets of @xmath3 had been accumulated for both field and cluster galaxies ( aaronson et al .",
    "1982 , bothun et al . 1985 ,",
    "aaronson et al .",
    "1989 , tormen & burstein 1995 [ hereafter tb95 ] ) .",
    "because of their usefulness these data have played a pivotal role in the subsequent irtf studies , and consequently led to the present paradigm of @xmath3 system for irtf studies . nevertheless , it is also true that we still await irtf to be calibrated with a surface photometric magnitude , as it provides a more fair and thus preferable measure of a galaxy luminosity .",
    "this requirement will be imminent and inflated as a significant progress will be made in extensive infrared surveys such as the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) and the deep near - infrared southern sky ( denis ) survey ( epchtein et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the infrared surface photometry of these galaxies is important not only for the calibration of the irtf , but also for exploring the photometric properties of the nearby galaxies .",
    "recently sakai et al ( 2000 ; hereafter s00 ) has raised a question pertaining to the possible offset of the @xmath1 magnitude between the nearby and cluster galaxies . in that paper",
    "they calibrated the luminosity - line width relations in @xmath15 and applied them to 23 clusters to obtain the global value of @xmath16 . from an internal comparison between @xmath16 s obtained in these different wavelengths they found that the mean @xmath16 obtained in @xmath3",
    "is 10% smaller than those obtained in the others .",
    "examining several observational properties of the sample galaxies they came to a conclusion that there should be a systematic difference in @xmath3 between the nearby calibrators and the cluster galaxies .",
    "it is yet unclear , however , whether this difference somehow comes from this peculiar photometry technique of @xmath3 or from a difference of intrinsic photometric properties between these galaxies . in order to disentangle this problem",
    "it is desirable to obtain surface photometry data for these nearby galaxies .    to address these issues",
    "we carry out @xmath0 and @xmath1 surface photometry for nearby galaxies having hst cepheid distance measurements .",
    "these galaxies have a large apparent size of @xmath17arcmin in diameter .",
    "accurate imaging photometry of such large galaxies is made available with a large - format infrared camera attached to the kiso schmidt telescope ( itoh , yanagisawa & ichikawa 1995 ) . with this configuration",
    "the camera covers an 18 arcmin - square field of view . using the data we calibrate irtf and apply the relation to cluster galaxies .",
    "some @xmath1-band photometric properties of galaxies will be also examined including the @xmath1 magnitude problem mentioned above .",
    "contents of this paper is as follows .",
    "observations of the sample galaxies and literature data used are described in section [ sec : sample ] .",
    "photometry results , accuracy , and external consistency are presented in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "calibration of irtfs is given in section [ sec : calibration ] , followed by a discussion on photometric properties of the sample galaxies and the application of irtf to cluster galaxies given in the literature in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our sample comprises nearby 12 spirals ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "they have been selected according to two criteria that hst cepheid observations be available and that inclination be larger than @xmath18 according to s00 or rc3 .",
    "the literature data of these galaxies are also summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] . in order to be as consistent with s00 as possible",
    ", we refer to the compilation by s00 for all the external data including galaxy distances , h i line widths , and inclinations whenever available .    as for the extinction correction",
    "we adopt schlegel et al ( 1998 ) for the galactic extinction and tully et al ( 1998 ) for the internal extinction .",
    "these were both adopted by s00 as well .",
    "since tully et al ( 1998 ) did not actually provide extinctions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , these values are evaluated using relations @xmath19 given by s00 and @xmath20 obtained by ourselves from an interpolation between @xmath21 and @xmath1 .",
    "s00 does not include ngc4639 , therefore its h i line width data are taken from huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) , and the inclination is computed using the axial ratio given in rc3 and the inclination formula given in s00 .",
    "as for the extinction corrections , there have been several alternative prescriptions advocated by different authors . to examine the effect of adopting different prescriptions we compare our adopting @xmath22 and @xmath23 with those computed from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) and rc3 , respectively .",
    "note in advance that since the uncertainty in the absolute magnitudes of galaxies due to the distance error is already more than 0.1 mag , that due to differences in various extinction correction methods is negligible .",
    "the galactic extinction by burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) is presented in @xmath24 hence converted to those in @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the ratio of @xmath25 given by schlegel et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that the burstein s value is systematically different from our @xmath22 only by less than 0.02mag , which is of no significance in the present study . for the comparison of the internal extinction the @xmath24-band value given in rc3 is also converted to those in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this conversion",
    "we are based on the ratio given by tully et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "they provide @xmath26 which , in conjunction with the above - mentioned relations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , leads to a ratio of @xmath30 .",
    "this ratio is substantially different from that previously given for @xmath22 . according to han ( 1992 ) and tully et al ( 1998 ) ,",
    "this difference is mostly ascribed to the configurations of the galactic and internal extinction which compel a light ray to pass through a different path lengths toward us . from this conversion",
    "it is shown that the systematic difference of @xmath23 between rc3 and our adopted scheme is mostly less than 0.05mag , except for only ngc7331 which raises 0.1mag difference .",
    "these differences are again negligible in the present work .",
    "as emphasized in s00 , which scheme to choose is insignificant but a consistency is important in a tf analysis .      the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images were obtained using the 105 cm schmidt telescope at the kiso observatory during the period between 1998 october and 1999 october . because of a time limitation a @xmath0 image of ngc4536 could not be obtained .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a large - format near - infrared camera called the kiso observatory near infrared camera or konic as abbreviated ( itoh , yanagisawa & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "konic is a ptsi camera having 1040@xmath311040 physical pixels .",
    "the output data are binned into 1040@xmath31520 pixels , while we use the image further binned into 520x520 pixels .",
    "the camera mounted on the kiso schmidt covers 18arcmin - square fov hence has a pixel scale of 2.12arcsec par the @xmath32 binned pixels .",
    "a single on - source exposure for a targe galaxy was taken to be 300sec .",
    "the same duration was assigned to an off - source exposure for a blank sky region displaced by at least 20arcmin from the target galaxy .",
    "the off - source exposure was taken after every 2 on - source exposures .",
    "typically successive 12 on - source exposures plus 6 intervening off - source exposures were thus taken for a single galaxy . the number of the on - source exposures actually varied from 4 to 16 depending on the galaxy brightness and/or a sky condition of the night .",
    "along with these exposures , infrared standard stars of elias et al ( 1982 ) were also observed every night at various zenith distances for the magnitude calibration .",
    "the exposures for the standard stars were appropriately defocused so that we could accumulate a sufficient number of the background signal count to avoid a deferred charge problem of the camera ( itoh , yanagisawa & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "the observed data were reduced using an image reduction software iraf v2.11.3 and stsdas v2.1 . a dark count was estimated and subtracted from the raw image using the richardson s formula calibrated with the dark images .",
    "image flattening was performed in a usual manner using combined blank sky images . a reduction error in these procedures",
    "are discussed later in section [ sec : accuracy ] .",
    "a sky background region in the galaxy frame was determined as an exterior region of a circle centered at the target galaxy . the radius , which extended up to @xmath33arcmin for the largest galaxies such as ngc925 , 4725 , and 7331 ,",
    "was determined according to the apparent size of the galaxy .",
    "signal counts of the sky background region was fitted with polynomial surfaces of several orders , and the best one determined by the visual inspection into the residual counts was subtracted from the image . actually a first - order polynomial surface was sufficient for most of the images .",
    "the remaining signal counts were then corrected for the atmospheric extinction and converted into the count in the cit magnitude system using the standard star data reduced in a similar way . in this conversion",
    "the extinction coefficients were determined for each individual night separately while the color conversion coefficients were commonly taken from the recommended color equations @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "considering an undesirably extended psf of the camera ( yanagisawa , itoh & ichikawa 1996 ) we deconvolved the galaxy images using a psf image .",
    "the deconvolution was performed using the lucy - richardson s method realized in the stsdas package . in this deconvolution",
    "two different psf images were separately applied to the same galaxy images to see an internal consistency .",
    "one psf is composed with several undisturbed stellar images in a galaxy frame , while the other is taken from a template psf image created earlier for an instrumental verification purpose .",
    "each of the psfs has its own advantage over the other ; the former has the same seeing condition as have the galaxy image to be working on , while the latter has a sufficiently high s / n hence reproduces the extended fainter outskirt of the psf more clearly .",
    "performing these two deconvolutions we obtained alternative results , i.e. , the former experiment reproduces the galaxy aperture data which are in better agreement with the literature data as used in section [ sec : external consistency ] while the latter provides better rectification of galaxy images without any discernible psf outskirt even around bright galaxies .",
    "the worse agreement of the aperture data for the latter deconvolution experiment is that the deconvolved galaxy image provides systematically too bright a magnitude at the inner apertures .",
    "it is noted that this systematic discrepancy , amounting typically to @xmath36mag , is unlikely due to a difference of the seeing disk conditions between our observations and those for the aperture photometry of the literature data ; this is because the discrepancy remains up to an aperture whose diameter is a few tens of seconds , where the difference of the seeing size should be no more an important issue on the aperture magnitude .    in spite",
    "that these two experiments of deconvolution provide partly unsatisfactory results , they nevertheless give consistent results regarding global photometry parameters such as the total , isophotal , and , synthetic aperture magnitudes that we are mostly concerned with in this study .",
    "making best use of this preferable result , we constructed a moderate psf image merging the kernel of the former psf and the extended cross and ring - like pattern of the latter .",
    "we find that the composite psf provides the most satisfactory deconvolution result in the sense that it simultaneously reduces the two undesirable aspects of the previous deconvolutions .",
    "accordingly , the composite psf was created for and applied to each individual galaxy for the deconvolution .    after the deconvolution foreground stellar images were cleaned out using the interpolation from the surrounding sky background count to provide the final galaxy image for photometry .",
    "none of the foreground stars severely contaminates the target galaxies , thereby we may disregard any photometry uncertainty to be introduced in this cleaning procedure .",
    "the deconvolution often generated a ring - shaped negative overshoot around bright stars .",
    "the amplitude of the overshoot was however negligible compared with the gross internal photometry error , so these defects were just cleaned in the same light of cleaning the inner stellar image .",
    "the amplitude of the sky background shot noise is typically equivalent to the surface brightness levels of @xmath37magarcsec@xmath14 and @xmath38magarcsec@xmath14 . in order to increase s / n of the fainter part of the galaxies we smoothed the image using a 5pixel - square or 11arcsec - square boxcar window . on the smoothed image we computed a series of isophotes at various surface brightness levels and fitted ellipses to the isophotes .",
    "the luminosity profiles and contour maps are given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we compute several isophotal parameters at @xmath39magarcsec@xmath14 and @xmath40magarcsec@xmath14 , which are collectively presented later in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "a caution is needed for the map of ngc925 in @xmath0 , as the isophotes is less reliable at its north - eastern outskirts .",
    "that portion of the image is unfortunately disturbed by a deferred charge in some pixel rows proximity to the overscan area attached to the boundaries of each quadrant of the detector array .",
    "this degradation of the image may affect the accuracy of some isophotal geometrical parameters .",
    "however , the fraction of the disturbed light is quite small compared with the galaxy total light , so we presume that the @xmath0 photometry of ngc925 does not suffer any additional serious uncertainty from this peripheral image degradation .    to obtain asymptotic total magnitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 we extrapolated the exponential disk to infinity .",
    "in this extrapolation the disk part of the galaxies was determined from the visual inspection into the luminosity profiles . to verify this determination we also referred to the axial ratio and the position angle varying along with the isophotal radius .",
    "the extrapolation typically amounts to 0.05mag with a few exception of faint or short exposure galaxies for which we need @xmath43mag of extrapolation .",
    "the extrapolation is subject to the uncertainties of the axial ratio , disk scale length , and central surface brightness adopted for the exponential disk .",
    "the error is assessed later in section [ sec : accuracy ] as a source of a photometry error for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the results of the surface photometry are summarized in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "description of the columns are as follows ; column(1 ) ngc number , column(2 ) asymptotic total magnitude @xmath41 and its error , column(3 ) isophotal magnitude @xmath44 and its error , column(4 ) isophotal major axis length @xmath45 in arcmin , column(5 ) effective radius @xmath46 in arcmin ,",

    "column(13 ) effective radius @xmath53 in arcmin , column(14 ) minor - to - major axial ratio @xmath54 .",
    "derivation of the quoted photometry error is discussed in the subsequent section . the nominal disagreement between @xmath47 and @xmath54",
    "is mostly ascribed to the measurement uncertainty ; it is evaluated to be @xmath55 based on their scatter within the surface brightness levels of @xmath39magarcsec@xmath14 and of @xmath40magarcsec@xmath14 .",
    "sources of the internal photometry error differ between the asymptotic , isophotal , and aperture magnitudes . for",
    "the asymptotic magnitude @xmath41 and @xmath42 the error @xmath56 is estimated as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 represent the errors caused by the flattening procedure , magnitude calibration procedure , and the disk extrapolation procedure , respectively . for the remaining magnitudes such as @xmath44 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 the internal error should be @xmath61 .",
    "each of these error sources is described in what follows .",
    "[ [ flattening ] ] flattening + + + + + + + + + +    we computed a dark count of an object frame using the richardson s formula calibrated with the data taken from a number of dark frames .",
    "the scatter of the data around the fitted formula is typically 10adu .",
    "a signal count of a single sky flat frame of a 300sec exposure was , on the other hand , generally larger than 2000adu / pixel in @xmath0 and 5000adu / pixel in @xmath1 excluding the bias and dark counts .",
    "accordingly , the 10adc error of the dark count subtraction causes flattening errors less than 0.5% and 0.2% in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "a more serious error in the flattening procedure is brought by a temporal variation of a local sky background brightness . to examine this variation we divided the associated off - source sky background images each other and",
    "see the distribution of the data counts in the quotient frame . from this examination",
    "no discernible global gradient of the sky background count is found for all the associated sky frames . a discernible deviation from the mean",
    "count is of rather random nature .",
    "the fractional deviation amounts to 3% at most both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the central part of the frames where a target galaxy was always exposed .",
    "as the deviation is for a single object frame , we summed it up quadratically for all the combined galaxy frames . from this , we obtain the uncertainty to be 1.5% for a combination of 4 frames ( 1200sec exposure , the shortest in the present observations ) and 0.8% for a composition of 16 frames ( 4800sec exposure , the longest ) .",

    "the former two components are derived from a linear fit to the luminosity profile , while the axial ratio is taken from s00 .",
    "adoption of this axial ratio is because the optical isophote refers to a deeper surface brightness level and because we like to avoid a possible unknown systematic error that may be introduced in our axial ratio through the deconvolution procedure .",
    "we computed the extrapolation error by practically changing these parameters within a reasonable range .",

    "taking all the errors given above into account we evaluate the internal photometry error for individual galaxies .",
    "the value is given for each magnitude in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we achieve a typical accuracy of @xmath63mag for the total magnitude except for two faintest galaxies ngc2541 and 3319 .",
    "the accuracy is even better for aperture and isophotal magnitudes as they refer only to relatively brighter portion of the galaxy image .",
    "growth curves of each galaxy are computed using a series of circular apertures .",
    "we compare the curves with aperture photometry data given in the literature to check an external consistency .",
    "the literature data include glass ( 1976 ) , aaronson ( 1977 ) , peletier & willner ( 1991 ) , tb95 , and the 2mass extended source catalog available on the web ( http://irsa.ipac .",
    "caltech.edu/applications/catscan/ ) .",
    "the result of the comparison is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "most of the literature data show an agreement with our values within 0.1mag . a relatively large and systematic discrepancy worth mentioning",
    "is observed in the following four galaxies ; ngc3198 : aperture data of tb95 ( 2 apertures ) are systematically fainter by 0.15mag than our photometry .",
    "ngc3319 : aperture data of tb95 ( 3 apertures ) are systematically fainter by 0.1mag than our photometry .",
    "ngc4639 : we find an increasing discrepancy toward larger apertures between surface photometric aperture data of 2mass ( 9 apertures ) and ours .",
    "the discrepancy amounts to @xmath64mag at the outermost aperture .",
    "aperture data of peletier & willner ( 1991 ) ( 1 aperture ) are more consistent with the 2mass data sequence . on the other hand , the template curve of tb95 for this type of galaxy ( @xmath65 ) matches better with our growth curve at the outer slope , implying that the 2mass photometry is not sufficiently deep for this galaxy .",
    "ngc4725 : aperture data in @xmath1 by tb95 ( 5 apertures ) are fainter by 0.1mag than our photometry . as for these four galaxies , independent data are needed to give further discussion on this photometry result .",
    "there are two other galaxies which show large discrepancy regarding @xmath3 ; ngc4535 : @xmath3 of tb95 is fainter by 0.29mag than our @xmath48 .",
    "this error on @xmath3 is ascribed to its wavy growth curve which can not be well fitted with the monotonically increasing template curve of tb95 .",
    "ngc7331 : @xmath3 of tb95 is brighter by 0.36mag than our @xmath48 .",
    "this error on @xmath3 is attributed to the lack of aperture data having a larger diameter .",
    "we compare the axial ratio with those obtained by s00 .",
    "the agreement is better than @xmath66 for most of the galaxies .",
    "relatively large error is found for ngc3319 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while @xmath69 ) .",
    "the compilation of the kinematical inclinations by s00 indicate @xmath70 , which is in better agreement with @xmath71 .",
    "this large discrepancy of the axial ratio of ngc3319 is ascribed to its faint , loosely - wound spiral arms . in the infrared images",
    "these arms are hardly visible , therefore they give negligible contribution to determining the axial ratio .",
    "this suggests that the optical image is generally perferable for determining the inclination of spirals .",
    "irtf diagrams calibrated in several magnitudes are shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "a striking feature common to all of the diagrams is that the irtf changes its slope at around @xmath2 . a further discussion on this issue is given in the subsequent section using an enlarged sample . results of the linear regression fit characterized by the slope , zero point , and the apparent scatter , are summarized in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "these parameters are computed both for the entire sample and for the subsample limited to @xmath72 .",
    "note a considerable reduction of the apparent scatter for the subsample compared with that of the entire sample .",
    "the calibration result with @xmath48 is apparently in good agreement in slope , zero point , and apparent scatter compared with that obtained by s00 .",
    "it should be noted that s00 referred to aaronson et al ( 1982 ) for the synthetic aperture photometry scheme which is different in the aperture system and the growth curve templates from the tb95 scheme that we adopt for @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , the present agreement implies that the photometry schemes of aaronson et al ( 1982 ) and tb95 have been both adequately accurate to obtain @xmath3 for the purpose of applying it to irtf , given the current uncertainty of other observables such as the line width , inclination , and extinctions .",
    "in this section we add coma cluster data by bernstein et al ( 1994 ) and ursa major ( uma ) cluster data by peletier & willner ( 1993 ) to the discussion in order to enlarge the sample and to apply the present calibration result to .",
    "both of the photometry data were calibrated using the elias s standard stars hence have a zero point comparable with our data .",
    "bernstein et al ( 1994 ) provided @xmath42 for 21 galaxies , among which 12 galaxies are also given @xmath3 by tb95 .",
    "galaxy inclination and h i line width data are taken from their original measurement and compilation .",
    "peletier & willner ( 1993 ) provides @xmath42 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for 22 galaxies .",
    "inclination and the line width are taken from their paper .",
    "corrections for the galactic and internal extinctions are performed following the manner we applied to the present sample .",
    "we first examine the difference between tb95 s aperture magnitude , @xmath3 and our @xmath48 as a function of a galaxy inclination and of type to see any systematic errors in @xmath3 .",
    "they both show no significant dependency , which means that the error of @xmath3 predominantly comes from a random error .",
    "we examine dependencies of @xmath73 on a galaxy axial ratio and on type ( fig.[fig05 ] ) .",
    "neither early nor late spirals exhibit a significant dependency of @xmath74 on the axial ratio .",
    "as is qualitatively expected from the variety of the bulge - to - disk light ratio on galaxy types , the mean values of @xmath74 is different between these two type ranges ; @xmath75mag for @xmath76 while @xmath77mag for @xmath78 .",
    "this difference implies that the application of irtf in @xmath3 need a caution ; if the calibrators and the cluster samples consist of considerably different population in terms of galaxy types , these may lead to a distance estimate suffering from a systematic error .",
    "a rather curious implication from this data plot is a deficiency of late spirals with @xmath79 at @xmath80 .",
    "we are yet to be confident of its reality , however , and certainly think that we need much more data for any further discussion .",
    "if this ever turns out to be the case , the rather moderate range of the axial ratio will make it an interesting and challenging problem .",
    "s00 demonstrated that there is a significant discrepancy between @xmath16 s obtained in @xmath21 and @xmath3 which corresponds to a systematic difference by 20% of the sample cluster distances . in a close relation to this",
    "it is also shown in s00 that the nearby calibrators have a redder color in @xmath6 ( but not in @xmath81 ) than the virgo , ursa major , coma , and two other clusters for a fixed @xmath82 .",
    "we confirm that this @xmath6 color offset persists even if we use @xmath48 for the nearby calibrators . instead of @xmath6 ,",
    "we plot @xmath4 in fig.[fig06 ] .",
    "although the ursa major galaxies show a relatively wide distribution regardless of @xmath82 and the sample seems yet poor , the plot for the coma galaxies shows with more convinction that the nearby calibrators are likely redder than the cluster galaxies .",
    "this fact indicates that some intrinsic color offset really exists in @xmath8 between the nearby calibrators and a certain cluster of galaxies . to see whether this color offset is caused alone by the possible peculiar properties of the @xmath1 luminosity , we plot another color @xmath83 in fig.[fig08 ] . in this figure",
    "nearby calibrators are again found to be redder than the coma galaxies but not so compared with the uma .",
    "these experiments demonstrate that , although the color offset in @xmath8 is quite likely to be real , we may not come to a hasty conclusion that the nearby calibrators are always redder than cluster galaxies in the colors relevant to @xmath1 . to address this color problem",
    "further in detail we need to accumulate more @xmath1 photometry data and examine the relevant colors reflecting the cluster environment .",
    "whether the tf relation is linear for a respectable range of the line width or not has been an issue of controversy ; while most of the tf studies have assumed a linearity in tf relation , some studies ( e.g. , aaronson et al 1986 ; mould , han & bothun 1989 ; mcgaugh et al 2000 ) adopted or argued for the nonlinearity of the relation .    as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , our result of irtf calibration apparently exhibits a breakdown for fainter galaxies with @xmath84 regardless of the bandpass or magnitude system .",
    "this boundary may be comparable with a similar break at @xmath85kms@xmath10 demonstrated by mcgaugh et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the irtf diagrams for the ursa major clusters are shown in fig.[fig07_uma ] , where the apparent magnitude is used instead .",
    "overplotted are the irtfs of the nearby calibrators as shown in fig.[fig8 ] but vertically scaled so that the gross scatter be minimized at the range @xmath86 .",
    "note in passing that this procedure yields simultaneously the cluster distance and the slope of the irtf for the composite sample of galaxies , to which we will be back in the next section .",
    "it is evident from these diagrams that the breakdown of irtf is reproduced by the uma galaxies .",
    "note also that the distribution of nearby calibrators and the cluster galaxies for @xmath84 are naturally homogenized as well .",
    "although the sample is not definitive yet , these facts provide another support to that the breakdown is a common features of irtf irrespective of galaxy environment",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the distribution of these fainter galaxies exhibits a larger scatter and a steeper slope which render a separate linear fitting to these data almost meaningless compared with the brighter galaxies with @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that , when irtf is used for measuring extragalactic distance scale , these intrinsically fainter galaxies should be excluded from the fitting procedure so as not to introduce unnecessary systematic error to the inferred distance .    in spite that the photometry error is now reduced down to @xmath87mag which is negligible compared with the apparent scatter of the tf relation , we do not obtain a significant reduction of the apparent scatter by using the @xmath42 instead of @xmath48 ( table [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the apparent scatter has no more been dominated by the uncertainty of the photometry , but rather by the errors of the distance and intrinsic line width estimates , or else by the intrinsic scatter itself .",
    "since it is currently practically difficult to obtain a more accurate distance for the calibrators , reducing the line width error seems to be the most feasible and promising strategy to take to approach the intrinsic shape of irtf . to achieve a successful result with this strategy , we need to obtain , among other things , definitive numbers for the inclination of the nearby calibrators .",
    "taking tentatively no account of the color problem discussed in the previous section , we give an estimate of the cluster distances based on the present irtf calibrations .",
    "irtf diagrams for the coma cluster galaxies is shown in fig.[fig07_coma ] .",
    "nearby calibrators are overplotted , and the distance and the slope of irtf for the composite sample are obtained in the same manner as described for uma galaxies in fig.[fig07_uma ] . in",
    "what follows the distances ( and the slopes ) are derived from only galaxies with @xmath86 because of the reason discussed in section [ sec : irtf_property ] .",
    "this limitation takes an extra advantage for especially the distant coma sample since a sample incompleteness bias becomes almost negligible for the brighter galaxies ( giovanelli et al 1997b ) .",
    "estimates of the distance modulus of the uma and coma are summarized in table.[tbl-4 ] .",
    "the quoted error is evaluated as a square root of the sum of the squares of dispersions around the calibrated irtf and the cluster irtf each divided by the respective number of galaxies . for uma",
    "the distance estimates in @xmath42 , @xmath3 , and @xmath49 show an excellent agreement each other , as well as with that obtained by s00 in @xmath21 , @xmath88mag .",
    "this agreement with the distance in @xmath21 seems inconsistent with s00 s implication that there is a severe @xmath8 offset between uma galaxies and the nearby calibrators .",
    "however , our examination of the @xmath8 color using @xmath42 has not provided definitely such a color offset for uma galaxies yet ( fig.[fig06 ] ) .",
    "estimates of the coma cluster distance in @xmath42 and @xmath3 exhibit a nominal discrepancy amounting to 0.11mag .",
    "although this is within the quoted error , we find that this discrepancy is ascribed to this particular coma sample for @xmath3 .",
    "this is evident from the left panel of fig.[fig07_coma ] , where it is illustrated that the majority of the galaxies with @xmath3 data are located underneath the regression line line of the irtf in @xmath42 . indeed ,",
    "if the @xmath42 sample is biased analogous to the @xmath3 sample , i.e. , limited to those with @xmath3 measurements available , the distance modulus of coma in @xmath42 is increased up to @xmath89mag ( the fourth row in table.[tbl-4 ] ) , which is consistent with the biased distance inferred in @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth commenting that this tendency found for the @xmath3 subsample of coma is also observed in the tf diagram in @xmath90 , i.e. , coma galaxies with @xmath3 measurements available tend to be found below the mean regression line in @xmath90 .",
    "this was assured by identifying @xmath3-measured galaxies ( bothun et al 1985 ) in giovanelli et al ( 1997a ) s sample and drawing the tf diagram in @xmath90 .",
    "similar identification and check were carried out for aco1367 , 2634 , 400 , ngc383 group , ngc507 group , cancer , and pegasus , but such a trend was not observed in these samples .    we see a shallower slope of @xmath91 for the @xmath42 sample of uma .",
    "this should be apparently ascribed to ngc3718 which has a largest deviation in @xmath42 among the uma galaxies .",
    "peletier & willner ( 1993 ) found the similar deviation for this galaxy and argued a plausible reason , in terms of its optical morphological peculiarity , of justifying its exclusion from the tf sample .",
    "we see in fig.[fig05 ] that there is a type dependence in @xmath73 .",
    "although a ks test suggests no significant difference ( at a @xmath92% confidence level ) of the morphological type distribution between the calibrators , coma galaxies , and uma galaxies , we examine the galaxy type dependence of the distance estimates .",
    "we divide the cluster galaxies into two subsamples of @xmath76 and @xmath78 and estimate the cluster distances separately using these subsamples and nearby calibrators divided into two as well .",
    "the result is shown in the fifth and sixth rows in table.[tbl-4 ] . for uma galaxies",
    "the result is consistent with that obtained from the entire analysis . for coma galaxies ,",
    "we obtain a nominally shorter distance @xmath93 , nevertheless it is still consistent with the global value if we consider the large error associated to this poor statistics .",
    "we adopt the distance modulus @xmath94mag obtained in @xmath42 as our best estimate of the coma distance .",
    "this number , compared with @xmath95mag obtained by s00 in @xmath21 , is larger by 0.2mag .",
    "this discrepancy is less than @xmath96 confidence level from our error budget .",
    "however , being consistent with what is expected from the @xmath8 color problem discussed in the previous section , this discrepancy may not be considered as an error of a random origin .",
    "using @xmath94mag of the coma cluster and the recession velocity of @xmath97kms@xmath10 in the cmb reference frame , and assuming that the deviation from the hubble flow is negligible , we obtain @xmath9kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "this value is nominally consistent with the global value of @xmath16 concluded by s00 .",
    "infrared @xmath0 and @xmath1 surface photometry have been carried out for 12 galaxies having a cepheid distance available via hst observations . using the data we have calibrated irtfs in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands .",
    "photometric properties of @xmath3 and colors relevant to @xmath1 have been examined .",
    "the calibrated irtfs are applied to the coma and ursa major galaxies .",
    "\\(2 ) the offset of @xmath3 from @xmath42 shows no significant dependence on the galaxy axial ratio .",
    "it is galaxy - type dependent such that @xmath73 is larger by 0.15mag for late type spirals ( @xmath98 ) than early ones ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the nearby calibrators are redder in @xmath4 than the coma galaxies .",
    "this is analogous to the property in @xmath6 claimed by s00 , but such a trend is not clearly visible for uma mostly because of poor statistics .",
    "it is yet unclear whether the color offset is caused alone by any peculiarity of the @xmath1 luminosity .",
    "\\(4 ) it is shown in all the magnitude systems that the irtf changes its slope at @xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon is observed for the ursa major galaxies as well .",
    "the apparent scatter is not significantly improved even if we use surface photometric magnitudes instead of @xmath3 .",
    "\\(5 ) from the application of the present calibration of irtf to the coma cluster , we obtain its distance to be @xmath7mag . with its cmb - rest recession velocity",
    "we obtain @xmath9kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted here that the distance is given no account of the possible color offset mentioned in ( 4 ) hence can be overestimated by @xmath5mag .",
    "we are deeply indebted to takashi ichikawa and kenshi yanagisawa for their lengthy efforts to develop and improve the large - format infrared camera konic to be available on the kiso schmidt .",
    "kenshi yanagisawa has kindly provided us with a psf image of konic .",
