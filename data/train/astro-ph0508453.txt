    "the discovery of excess far - infrared emission from @xmath0 lyrae by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) by @xcite demonstrated for the first time that proto - planetary material around other stars could be both detected and studied .",
    "further studies of iras point sources revealed that many types of star displayed strong emission at iras wavelengths .",
    "this excess is mostly due to thermally re - radiating circumstellar dust or , mostly in the case of hot be stars , due to free - free and bound - free emission from their ionised gaseous disks .",
    "consequently , the iras point source catalogue @xcite became a much used source for the search and identification of stars surrounded by circumstellar material .",
    "the use of an iras two - colour diagram to systematically identify evolved stars in the iras psc , was developed and undertaken by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that the majority of the infrared ( ir ) excess stars were carbon or oxygen rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars undergoing mass loss .",
    "other studies by @xcite and @xcite also discovered giant and first ascent red giant stars with ir excess .",
    "another manner of finding objects was to use optical catalogues and cross - correlate those with the iras psc .",
    "systematic studies such as those by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proved very successful in returning all well - known vega - type systems and in addition uncovering large numbers of both young and evolved stars alike .",
    "for example , the presence of ir excess became one of the defining characteristics of pre - main sequence herbig ae / be stars , and evolved post - agb stars where the agb mass loss phase had ended and the ir excess traces the cool , detached dust shell ( see for example the reviews by @xcite on post - agb stars , @xcite on dusty disks and @xcite on herbig ae / be stars ) .",
    "however , the relatively large beam size of iras ( 45x 15at 12@xmath1 m and larger at longer wavelengths ) meant that regions such as the galactic plane could not be studied properly because of source confusion .",
    "in addition , due to its orbit , the iras satellite also did not observe 4% of the sky .",
    "these so - called `` iras gaps '' have never been surveyed in the mid - ir .",
    "the mid - course space experiment ( msx ) satellite carried out a mid - ir survey of the galactic plane and other areas of the sky missed by iras using the spirit iii instrument ( full details @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity of spirit iii at 8@xmath1 m is comparable to iras , but its beam size is approximately 35 times smaller ( at the longest wavelength ) and is therefore much less hampered by source confusion .",
    "it discovered 430  000 objects in the galactic plane ( defined as @xmath26 ) , which is four times as many as iras detected in this region of the sky .",
    "moreover , it surveyed the iras gaps for the first time in the mid - ir .",
    "the msx survey thus provides an excellent opportunity to systematically search the galactic plane and the iras gaps for ir excess stars .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to find optically bright objects within the msx point source catalogues that were previously unknown as having ir excess .",
    "the resulting list can then be used for ( optical ) follow up studies .",
    "the methodology we adopt is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "they cross - correlated the optical sao catalogue with the iras psc , to identify objects with ir excess .",
    "the far - ir colours immediately revealed non - photospheric emission if the temperatures are less than about 200k while those objects with higher colour temperatures are identified by assessing the ir fluxes compared to that predicted from the photospheric optical emission .",
    "after a further selection on spectral type ( bafg - typical for most evolved and young stars ) this search revealed a master sample of 462 objects .",
    "as msx did not observe beyond 20@xmath1 m , it is not readily possible to find excess objects based on msx data alone , and we will rely on computing the ir excesses using additional information to identify the stars of interest . rather than use the sao catalogue , we will use the much larger optical tycho-2 catalogue @xcite and its accompanying spectral type catalogue @xcite which contains more than 350 000 spectral types as a starting point . to further characterise the infrared emission of any objects found we will also use data from the 2mass all sky catalogue of point sources ( hereafter 2mass psc ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ xcorr ] describes the initial input catalogues and the cross correlation of the galactic plane sample in detail . in section [ results ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the resulting sample and develop a new method of identifying ir excess stars .",
    "we end with a discussion of the resulting final sample of excess stars and outline the way it is presented .",
    "we also discuss in appendix [ app ] the application of the excess identification procedure to the msx iras gap survey and other regions surveyed by the msx mission .",
    "in order to define an ir excess for the sample stars , we use the msx mid - ir catalogue , the optical tycho-2 catalogue and the near - ir 2mass psc .",
    "as will be shown later , once the `` optical '' stars have been identified , the use of their near - ir magnitudes has marked advantages over using the optical data alone .",
    "below we will describe the input catalogues and galactic plane cross - correlation in detail .",
    "the other msx catalogue cross - correlations will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "the msx spirit iii instrument observed in six photometric bands between 4 and 21.34@xmath1 m , and was most sensitive at 8.3@xmath1 m where its sensitivity was comparable to the iras 12@xmath1 m band .",
    "the msx mission surveyed the galactic plane , iras gaps , magellanic clouds as well as some other regions of high stellar density .",
    "a major data product of the msx mission was the msx psc v2.3 ( hereafter msx psc ) @xcite which has a positional accuracy , @xmath3 , and a limiting flux at 8@xmath1 m of 0.1 jy .    as we wish to identify a large sample of new ir excess stars , we require a sufficiently large and accurate optical star catalogue . for this reason we used the tycho-2 star catalogue compiled from data collected by the tycho star mapper on - board the hipparcos astrometric satellite .",
    "the positional accuracy of tycho-2 is excellent and more than required for our cross - correlation purposes .",
    "the completeness limit ( 99% ) of the catalogue is given as 11 in the @xmath4 band , and its limiting magnitude is about 14 in the @xmath4 band and 15 in the @xmath5 band .",
    "tycho-2 observed objects many times , resulting in a photometric precision of typically 0.05 mag . obviously , this precision becomes worse at the fainter end , for magnitudes around 10 - 11 the photometric error is 0.1 mag rising to 0.3 mag close to the detection limits .",
    "the tycho-2 catalogue does not contain any stars brighter than @xmath6 or @xmath7 due to the nature of the data reduction technique .",
    "we used the brighter stars from the first supplement to the tycho 2 stars catalogue .",
    "near - ir photometry is taken from the 2mass psc which contains nearly half a billion sources .",
    "the survey is complete to magnitude @xmath815 .",
    "the data has relatively bright saturation limits ( @xmath83.5 ) , though for @xmath9 the 2mass catalogue lists photometry estimated from radial profile fitting to the wings of the saturated sources .",
    "the photometric accuracy , especially at the fainter end , is better than that of tycho-2 and for bright saturated sources comparison with previous observations suggest the error is typically @xmath10% .",
    "finally , to learn more about the sample , spectral type information is very important .",
    "@xcite compiled all known spectral classifications for tycho-2 stars and their catalogue contains spectral types for 351  863 stars of which 61  472 are in the galactic plane ( defined here as @xmath26 ) . as might be expected the objects with spectral types are somewhat brighter on average than the full sample .      we have positionally correlated the tycho 2 star catalogue and the msx v2.3 psc . for a positional association between a tycho 2 star and a msx source ,",
    "the separation of the two objects is required to be less than 6 , corresponding to a typical 3@xmath11 accuracy of the msx position . in the case of two stars within 6  of an msx source",
    "we have taken the closest .",
    "the deviations of the msx positions compared to the tycho-2 positions in the right ascension and declination directions are centred at zero with @xmath11=2  indicating that , in a statistical sense , the tycho-2 and msx associations are real .",
    "the shape of the distribution compared well with the similar in - scan and cross - scan separation distributions shown by @xcite . to test the 6  cutoff",
    "the correlation was extended out to a radius of 15 .",
    "we found that the majority ( 90% ) of the associations had separations smaller than 6  and the distribution showed that at larger radii the number of associations reached some random background level .",
    "we therefore concluded that 6  was the optimum value for the cutoff for positional association .",
    "the msx - tycho 2 sources have also been further correlated with the 2mass psc , using a 6  search radius around the msx position . in the case of multiple 2mass sources within the 6  search radius , we have taken the closest match and flagged the msx source .    to ensure that all msx-2mass counterparts are also tycho 2-msx-2mass associations",
    ", we require the 2mass source to be additionally within 0.50  of the tycho 2 catalogue position . failing to do the latter returns many sources that are either unrelated to the msx or the tycho-2 source and",
    "would severely contaminate the final sample .",
    "we made use of the infrared science archive ( irsa ) to perform the 2mass cross - correlations .      at this stage",
    "we made certain requirements of the photometry provided by the different catalogues for further inclusion in the sample so presence of the ir excess is credible / significant .",
    "for the tycho 2 star catalogue we required that a star be detected at both the @xmath5 and @xmath4 bands ( corresponding to a magnitude less than 15 and 14 in @xmath5 and @xmath4 respectively according to the tycho 2 explanatory supplement @xcite ) .",
    "for the msx data we required a detection in at least one band with flux quality greater than 1 ( signal - to - noise ratio greater than 5 ) .",
    "the only constraint we made on the 2mass photometry is that it must be better than an upper limit ( i.e not having a u or x flag ) at all bands .     and",
    "v@xmath12 bands are represented by the thick and faint solid lines respectively .",
    "the msx 8@xmath1 m distribution is indicated by the broken line . ]",
    "the msx psc ( ver 2.3 ) galactic plane @xmath13 @xmath14survey ( including the plane regions of the iras gaps ) contains 431  711 sources .",
    "after cross correlation with the tycho 2 optical star catalogue , we are left with 35  044 ( @xmath15 associations which meet our photometric constraints .",
    "the bulk ( @xmath16 ) of these galactic plane sources were only detected at the most sensitive msx band a ( 8.28@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the further correlation of the msx - tycho 2 sources with the 2mass psc search found 33  495 ( 95% ) counterparts .",
    "a small fraction of these ( 3% ) had multiple 2mass sources within the msx search area , in these cases we can not rule out the possibility that the msx source is actually a nearby optically invisible 2mass source rather than the tycho 2 star .",
    "a clear example of this is the b type star hd  93942 ( the object with @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] @xmath20 8 in figure [ nearcolour ] ) which is in close proximity to a very red ( optically invisible ) carbon star . in the near - ir there are two 2mass sources within 6of the msx source position .",
    "although the msx flux is most likely from the carbon star it is difficult to determine which of the 2mass sources is the correct association .",
    "as we can not objectively remove these sources we flag them .    using the magnitude distribution of the sample",
    "( see figure [ completeness ] ) we estimate the sample is complete to magnitude 8 in @xmath4 , 11 in @xmath5 and 5 in msx band a ( or [ 8 ] hereafterm ] ) .",
    "this makes it the most complete ir sample of optical stars in the galactic plane to date .",
    "of the 35  044 tycho 2-msx sources described above , about a third , 12  783 , are listed in the tycho 2 spectral type catalogue . a smaller fraction of these 7443 have two dimensional spectral types .",
    "to ascertain how many of our sources have previously been detected with iras and hence estimate how many objects in our final sample are new identifications , a positional correlation of the msx - tycho 2 sources with the iras psc @xcite has also been undertaken .",
    "we used the vizier catalogue access tool to search the iras psc around the msx positions of our msx - tycho 2 associated stars . for the correlation we use a circular search radius of 45 typically corresponding to three times",
    "the major axis of the elliptically shaped iras 1@xmath11 positional uncertainties @xcite .",
    "of the 35  044 msx - tycho 2 sources , 9473 were found to be within 45  of an iras source . we therefore conclude that the majority of any ir excess stars in this paper are new identifications and previously unstudied .",
    "in the following we will first discuss the properties of the sample using colour - colour diagrams , and then continue with the identification of excess stars . in order to do this",
    ", we will first derive a relationship between the near - ir colours and the msx 8@xmath1 m magnitude for normal stars .",
    "we will concentrate on the largest msx catalogue , that of the galactic plane and briefly discuss the selection from the other samples later .",
    "figure [ optcolour ] shows a ( @xmath5@xmath18@xmath4,@xmath4@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] ) colour - colour diagram ) we have used the msx filter averaged astronomical silicate data @xcite as derived by @xcite . for the near - ir wavelengths ( @xmath21 ) we adopt an extinction law that varies as @xmath22 . for the optical bands we have used the standard optical @xmath23 extinction relation . ] which is the msx analogue to the well studied diagnostic iras ( _ b@xmath18v_,_v_@xmath18[12 ] ) diagram ( e.g. @xcite herafter wca ) .",
    "the left hand panel , containing all objects , shows a main band with increasing spread around it towards redder colours , the objects with known spectral types are plotted in the right hand panel .",
    "not surprisingly this subsample is on average brighter , and a large number of objects has dropped out , allowing us to recognise a well - defined band in the plot .",
    "the larger spread evident in the full sample is thus mostly due to larger photometric errors .",
    "this diagram is a good diagnostic to identify ir excess stars , as originally described by wca .",
    "normal stars follow a well - defined sequence , while objects with excess 8@xmath1 m emission are readily identified by their deviating @xmath4@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours .",
    "this is also observed here ; the `` main band '' of stars follows a more or less well - defined relation and is accompanied by objects located above this relation .",
    "these are the ir excess stars , the majority of stars in the tycho 2-msx sample are not ir excess stars but normal stars .              to further investigate the properties of the sample , we plot the colour - colour diagrams for each spectral type in figure [ optspectype ] .",
    "the sample is broken down into the spectral types o - m while a set of carbon stars , taken from the catalogue of galactic carbon stars ( cgcs @xcite ) , is also shown . where known , dwarfs ( luminosity class v ) ,",
    "giants ( iv - iii ) and supergiants ( i - ii ) are indicated by different plot symbols . as a guide for the intrinsic colours of main sequence stars in figure [ optspectype ] we show the median @xmath4@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours of b0 to m0 dwarf stars taken from @xcite plotted against the intrinsic @xmath24@xmath18@xmath25 colours of these stars given by @xcite which are corrected for tycho photometry using the transformations given in @xcite .",
    "the earlier type stars are dominated by main sequence stars , while giants constitute the majority for the later type objects as the dwarfs are too faint to be detected in both optical and ir catalogues .",
    "the transition between dwarfs and giants is visible as the relative paucity of sources at @xmath26@xmath18@xmath4 @xmath20 0.75 .",
    "a separate bifurcation is also visible at @xmath26@xmath18@xmath4 @xmath20 1 in fig.[optcolour ] .",
    "the upper sequence consists of reddened supergiants while the lower sequence consists of giant ( and some dwarfs ) .",
    "this separation of luminosity classes ( beginning at early g type ) was first noted by @xcite in the iras @xmath25@xmath18@xmath27 $ ] diagram .",
    "a property apparent for all spectral types is that the non - excess stars span a much wider @xmath5@xmath18@xmath4 range than the intrinsic colours for the respective types signal .",
    "this is due to the presence of a large interstellar reddening at low galactic latitudes , and is illustrated by the reddening vector indicated in the diagram .",
    "the main bands defined by non - excess stars per spectral type are parallel to the extinction , and correspond to values up to @xmath28 .",
    "often the reddest objects are supergiants , which is consistent with reddening as well ; the objects with the largest extinction are presumably at the largest distances and therefore have to be intrinsically brighter .    for the b type stars , and also , but less obvious , for the o stars due to the lower number of stars involved , the colour diagram is dominated by two bands which are both populated by main sequence stars .",
    "the lower band contains normal , non - excess objects , and the upper band is populated by a large number of excess stars , many of which are be stars .",
    "the excess emission is explained by free - free emission from the ionised gas in the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the relative number of a type excess stars is much smaller , and seems to consist of dwarfs and supergiants in roughly equal numbers .",
    "there would seem to be a special class of a type stars around @xmath5@xmath18@xmath4 = 1.5 , where these seem to branch off at a different slope than the other a type stars .",
    "it appears however that these objects have colours similar to k type stars and the most likely explanation for this is that their spectral types are misclassified or that they are binaries with a k type counterpart .",
    "the f , g and k type stars have fewer excess objects . the m star sample shows a distinct upturn . as already noted by wca , for these cool objects , the optical colours probe the wien part of the spectral energy distribution and show hardly any dependency on temperature anymore .",
    "the 8@xmath1 m band is sensitive to spectral features , such as molecular bands and therefore shows a strong gradient .",
    "this particular colour diagram is thus not a useful diagnostic to identify m stars with ir excess .    perhaps unsurprisingly ,",
    "the carbon stars follow a similar band as the m stars .",
    "however the relatively large photometric uncertainties of these faint stars means they sometimes appear at much bluer colours than would normally be expected .",
    "it is important to highlight a significant difference with previous studies here .",
    "wca in - particular , but also @xcite used optical catalogues with brighter cut - offs ( the bright star catalogue @xcite and the smithsonian astrophysical observatory star catalogue @xcite with limits _ v _",
    "= 7 and 9 - 10 respectively ) than used here .",
    "the deeper tycho-2 sample inevitably contains a large fraction of ( heavily ) reddened stars , which is aggravated by the fact that we observe in the direction of the galactic plane .",
    "it can be seen in the upper left panel of figure [ optspectype ] , that the extinction vector is non - parallel to the `` normal star '' relation , this gives heavily reddened normal stars @xmath4@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours similar to excess stars .",
    "moreover , the fainter , numerous , tycho-2 stars have comparatively large photometric errors ( as indicated by the large spread in figure [ optcolour ] ) , making it harder to recognise excess emission from the optical - ir colour - colour diagram .",
    "it is therefore not trivial to properly identify stars with excess from the tycho 2-msx data alone .",
    "therefore , to make headway , we need to go to wavelengths where the extinction will be less , the near - ir .      to reduce the impact of extinction on the ir excess star selection , we show the near- and mid - ir colour equivalent to fig.[optcolour ] in fig .",
    "[ nearcolour ] .",
    "the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] range spanned by the normal stars is much smaller than the @xmath4@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] range because we now probe the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectral energy distribution for all stars .",
    "the @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17 colour range is small for the same reason , while the reddening is less severe ( typically @xmath30@xmath18@xmath31@xmath18@xmath32 ) .",
    "most of the objects beyond @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17@xmath330.5 suffer from reddening , also objects with excess emission at _ k _ give rise to red @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17 colours .    to understand and describe the features of the colour diagram , we have also plotted the colours of known objects ( fig.[nearcolour ] ) which have been observed by msx ( but are not necessarily part of the tycho 2 sample ) .",
    "the objects plotted are from the following catalogues : optical selected carbon stars from @xcite , oh / ir stars ( agb stars with large mass loss rates stars ) from @xcite , herbig ae / be stars from @xcite and the be type stars extracted from our own tycho 2 sample ( which were found to agree with the mid- near- ir colours of all known be stars as compiled by @xcite ) .    the distribution of b stars with excess in fig .",
    "[ nearspectype ] shows a clearly defined band of excess stars with @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19<2 $ ] and a more diffuse distribution of stars with greater excess emission , which is further complemented by a large number of excess stars without spectral classification ( see fig .",
    "[ nearcolour ] ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent from fig.[nearcolour ] that only the b stars with @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19<2 $ ] can be explained by the properties of the known be stars .",
    "the remaining objects with greater excess emission are therefore very interesting ; we discuss in section [ discuss ] the possible nature of these objects .",
    "the two branches beginning at @xmath29@xmath18@xmath34 , with gradients roughly equal to the reddening vector , are clearly associated with the carbon and oh / ir stars .",
    "the oh / ir stars also have a slightly greater ( 1 mag ) @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour , presumably due to their higher mass loss rates over these optically selected carbon stars .",
    "the herbig ae / be stars all show excess emission and are heavily reddened , due to their surrounding circumstellar material .",
    "spot checks on stars with @xmath29@xmath18@xmath35 revealed the majority have saturated _ k _ band magnitudes , and therefore their colours are just affected by the resulting errorbar . the objects with @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19<-0.50",
    "$ ] are in general variable stars and binaries .",
    "although we plot the same number of objects in figs.[optcolour ] and [ nearcolour ] , the excess stars are more easily distinguishable than in the optical diagram .",
    "in addition to the reduced extinction , this is also the case because of the smaller photometric errorbars involved , validating the use of near - ir colours .    the distribution over spectral type is shown in figure [ nearspectype ] .",
    "all features described for the optical ( fig.[optspectype ] ) are present , but much more prominent .",
    "it is clear that the near - mid ir two colour diagram is a much better tool for the selection of ir excess stars , due to the removal of the strong extinction effect and the better photometric accuracy of 2mass for the optically fainter objects .",
    "we therefore proceed with this colour diagram to identify ir excess stars .              to identify stars with excess 8@xmath1 m emission , we first need to know the photospheric contribution for all stars at this wavelength . to derive this",
    "we adopt the iterative procedure used by wca for iras sources .",
    "this involves dividing the sample into @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17 colour bins ( 0.01 mag width in our case ) and calculating the mean @xmath36@xmath18@xmath37)_{av}$ ] and standard deviation @xmath11 of the bin . by eliminating the outliers ( defined as deviating by more than 2@xmath11 from the mean ) , this process was repeated until the ( @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19$])@xmath38 no longer changed significantly with further iterations .",
    "the procedure was only run over the intrinsic main sequence near - ir colours given by @xcite ( @xmath29@xmath18@xmath39 ) .",
    "this step essentially removes the heavily extincted sources , whose infrared colours are heavily distorted by reddening .",
    "the final @xmath36@xmath18@xmath19)$]@xmath38 values could then be well fitted by the following straight line .",

    "in this section we select the excess stars .",
    "we first discuss the more numerous 8@xmath1 m excess stars , and then discuss excess at the other msx wavelengths .      to calculate the ir excess emission of the stars in our sample we follow @xcite who used the relationship between the photospheric colours in the optical and iras 12 @xmath1 m for normal stars . with the expression of the intrinsic @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour for normal stars already in hand , it is trivial to compute the excess 8@xmath1 m emission . expressed in magnitudes this",

    "the main issue is to decide on where to choose the cutoff for inclusion into the final sample of infrared excess stars . in fig .",
    "[ excess ] we show a histogram of the excesses in magnitudes .",
    "the distribution of @xmath41@xmath18@xmath19)$ ] is asymmetric about zero .",
    "the negative excesses show a gaussian shape .",
    "the positive side also displays an underlying gaussian distribution , with a large non - gaussian tail that contains the excess stars . the gaussian shape on the negative side",

    "the width ( @xmath42 ) in this case is dominated by the photometric error in the msx 8@xmath1 m flux ( 5 - 20% ) rather than the intrinsic scatter of normal non - excess stars .",

    "we choose to have at least an 80% probability of ir excess in our sample .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath41@xmath18@xmath19)$ ] cutoff of 0.40 magnitudes .    using this criteria",
    "we identify 1830 @xmath43 m excess stars in our sample , around half of which ( 965 ) are not within 45of an iras point source and are therefore new identifications .",
    "we also identify one excess star which was too bright to be included in the tycho 2 catalogue ( and hence was picked up in the tycho 2 supplement ) , the well known be star @xmath44 cas .",
    "it should be noted that the above procedure selects objects that have excess 8@xmath1 m emission _ relative to _ the _ k _ band .",
    "an object surrounded by only hot dust will not be selected as its 8@xmath1 m emission has a similar @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour as a cool c or m type star .",
    "indeed , the intrinsic @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour for a 1000 - 2000 k black body is about @xmath45 0.5 , and it may well be that such objects will not be selected as their observed @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour seems to all intents and purposes `` normal '' .",
    "we therefore need to identify _ k _ band excess stars separately .",
    "we investigated several ways to identify such objects and found the best method is to use @xmath4@xmath18@xmath46@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours as shown in figure.[hotcoldexcess ] .",
    "this avoids the problem of having the large errorbars we encountered in the optical @xmath5@xmath18@xmath4 colours and includes objects with excess even at the _ h _ band .",
    "it is extremely rare for hot dust to be responsible for _ j _ band excess .",
    "indeed , checks on a random sample of _ j _ excess emission objects revealed them to be uncatalogued binary objects , where the _ j _ emission is due to a bright cool secondary .",
    "we identify the _ k _ band excess stars using a similar iterative procedure as for the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours and we derive the following relation for the photospheric contribution .",
    "@xmath47)_{photo}=-0.025 + 0.420(v_t - j)-0.021(v_t - j)^2 \\label{hotms}\\ ] ]    the excess @xmath48@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colour distribution showed that the probability of excess reached 80% at a @xmath49@xmath18@xmath19 ) = 0.60 $ ] magnitudes and this is where we placed the excess cutoff .",
    "this method of excess identification returned only 68% of the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] excess sources and a further 95 stars which do not have excess compared to _",
    "k _ at @xmath43 m or @xmath50 m . interestingly only 9 were not observed by iras , possibly because the hot excess stars are relatively infrared bright .",
    "stars such as post - agb stars surrounded by a cool detached dust shell may not show any distinguishing excess emission at 8@xmath1 m .",
    "we therefore wish to use the longer wavelength msx bands to identify such sources in our sample .",
    "the previous searches for cold excess objects ( e.g @xcite ) made use of the iras far - ir colour - colour diagram to identify excess if temperatures are less than 200k ( indicating that infrared emission was not photospheric ) .",
    "a similar approach with msx is hampered by the reduced sensitivity of msx at longer wavelengths .",
    "indeed , very few sources ( 2% ) in the sample are detected ( i.e flux quality greater than 1 ) in every band . as a compromise we will use the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51 $ ] colour ( see figure [ hotcoldexcess ] ) to identify cool excess objects",
    "this has the further advantage that stars detected exclusively at @xmath50 m are not removed from the sample as they would be if we relied on a multi msx colour diagram .",
    "figure [ hotcoldexcess ] shows the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51 $ ] colours , of all sources with a flux quality greater than 1 at 21@xmath1 m , plotted against _",
    "h@xmath18k_. objects that are found to display 8@xmath1 m excess emission are indicated by a dot , while those not detected at 8@xmath1 m or not found to have excess are indicated by larger plot symbols .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the majority of the cool excess objects also have excess @xmath43 m emission .",
    "of the stars without 8@xmath1 m excess only a few have @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51 $ ] colours significantly different from the rest of the sample ( the majority of which are m giants ) .",
    "all sources that are detected at @xmath50 m but are not detected in the more sensitive @xmath43 m band show cool excess emission . to determine the excess cutoff we have used the median @xmath25@xmath18@xmath52 $ ] values published by @xcite and converted to @xmath17@xmath18@xmath52 $ ] using the appropriate @xmath25@xmath18@xmath17 colours from @xcite . as the [ 21 ] and [ 25 ] bands both probe the molecular absorption bands of the cool m type giant stars",
    ", we may assume that the @xmath17@xmath18@xmath52 $ ] and @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51 $ ] colours are roughly comparable .",
    "we therefore define the excess cutoff to be the 3 sigma deviation from the intrinsic @xmath17@xmath18@xmath52 $ ] colours of giants .",
    "hence we select stars with cool infrared excess if they have @xmath29@xmath18@xmath53 and @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51>1 $ ] or @xmath17@xmath18@xmath51>3 $ ] at @xmath29@xmath18@xmath54 , as shown in fig [ hotcoldexcess ] . using this criteria",
    "we identify 13 cool ir excess stars which do not have excess 8@xmath1 m emission , 5 of which do not have iras counterparts .",
    "in this paper we have searched for stars with infrared excess in the combined tycho-2 , 2mass and msx catalogues .",
    "this resulted in a grand total of 1938 excess stars , of which 979 were not detected by iras and are thus newly discovered objects .      in figure [ spechist ]",
    "we show the number of tycho 2-msx stars as a function of temperature class . alongside",
    "we also show the percentage of these stars which were found to have excess emission .",
    "we find that the percentage of excess appears to decrease with effective temperature and that the hotter stars ( o , b and a ) and very cool ( m ) have a much higher percentage of excess stars than the f , g and k classes .",
    "however it is interesting to note that the numbers of tycho 2-msx stars detected shows the exact opposite behaviour , indicating that a strong selection effect may be present .",
    "a comparison of the tycho 2-msx sample with the entire galactic plane tycho 2 spectral type catalogue shows that we detect a higher fraction of g and k type compared to other spectral types .",
    "the most obvious source of this effect is the sensitivity of the msx satellite .",
    "for example , the photospheric emission at @xmath43 m for all but the brightest o , b and a type stars may be below the detection threshold of msx ; we only detect the excess and bright non - excess stars ( which are relatively few ) thus leading to a higher fraction of excess stars for these spectral types .",
    "the high fraction ( 30% ) of excess in b type stars is surprising , as the fraction of be type stars in the bright star catalogue is well known to be 15% @xcite .",
    "we also noted earlier that there exists a large group of b type ( with and without spectral classification ) excess stars with colours that were significantly different to the known be stars .",
    "the nature of these objects is not altogether obvious .",
    "their @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17 colours are quite blue indicating that these are indeed b type stars .",
    "the normality of the @xmath29@xmath18@xmath17 colour indicates that they do not have a great deal of _ k _ band excess .",
    "the absence of excess in the _ k _ band would seem to lead us away from a free - free emission explanation for these excesses and indicates that these stars are unrelated to the be stars immediately below them in figure [ nearcolour ] .",
    "the objects are also not particularly reddened , ruling out heavily dust embedded objects and implying the surrounding dust must be relatively optically thin .",
    "we are therefore looking for a optically thin thermally radiating dust mechanism for these stars .",
    "possibilities include : hot post - agb stars with a optically thin cool detached dust shell , reflection nebulosities , giant stars heating the surrounding interstellar medium dust , weak hii regions and vega type stars surrounded by a close warm disk of dust .",
    "to resolve the situation we looked at the spectral energy distributions of the subsample with iras detections .",
    "we showed that the objects with intermediate @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours ( @xmath55 ) to be herbig stars , be stars , reflection nebulae and post - agb stars .",
    "the objects with larger @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] colours were found to be predominately objects such as post - agb stars , hii regions and a number of galactic cirrus contaminated fields ( some possibly also heated by giant stars ) .",
    "we did not find much evidence for vega type disk systems . to complement this",
    "we also inspected galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ; see @xcite ) images for the small number ( @xmath56 ) of these stars which were within the survey region .",
    "the glimpse images mostly showed these objects to be stars within diffuse emission regions and/or associated with star forming regions .",
    "these objects would benefit from ground based optical follow up observations to better confirm their nature and to further understand this region of the colour diagram .",
    "we publish in hardcopy ( see table [ finaltable ] ) the stars which were not detected by iras ( and therefore should be new identifications ) , that have full spectral type information and excess @xmath57>0.75 $ ] mag and/or excess emission at other bands .",
    "the entire sample ( including the other regions discussed in the appendix ) is published in the online version of this paper ( see tables 2,3,4 and 5 ) .",
    "a machine readable format will also be made available at cds strasbourg .      to identify stars with ir excess emission",
    "we have positionally correlated the msx psc with the tycho 2 star catalogue .",
    "we found that a near - mid ir colour diagram had marked advantages over a optical - mid ir colour diagram in selecting these objects , specifically in reducing the strong line of sight extinction experienced in the direction of the galactic plane . using the derived colours of normal stars a selection criteria was developed to identify excess emission sources from the colour diagram .",
    "the criteria produced a sample of 1938 stars in the galactic plane , just over 50% of which were determined to be new identifications of infrared excess ( i.e not previously detected by iras ) .",
    "the majority of the excess stars were found to be hot stars , a high ( 30% ) fraction of b type stars with excess was discovered .",
    "the infrared excesses for a number of these b type stars were found to be much greater than those of the known be sample .",
    "the known objects in this group were found to be a mixture of herbig stars , post - agb stars , reflection nebulae and stars contaminated by galactic cirrus .",
    "the other regions surveyed by msx were also searched for ir excess stars and the same selection criteria were applied ( see sec [ app ] ) .",
    "we publish the entire excess sample online ( see table 2 ) and the brightest new identifications of excess stars in the galactic plane , in table [ finaltable ] .",
    "these lists should provide a good starting point for future ground based follow up observations .",

    "the msx satellite observed a number of regions in addition to the galactic plane and the iras gaps . these were generally regions of high source density that were labelled as confused by iras and included the magellanic clouds , several star forming regions and a number of extended objects such as galaxies .",
    "we have undertaken a search for excess stars in the iras gaps and all of the above regions except the galaxies .",
    "the results of these searches are discussed below .    a positional correlation of the non - plane ( @xmath61 ) msx catalogue sources with the tycho 2 star catalogue found 5898 ( 68% ) msx sources within 6of a tycho 2 star .",
    "the non - plane msx catalogue contains both the iras gap ( section [ irasgap ] ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) surveys .",
