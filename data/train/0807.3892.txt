    "the brauer algebra @xmath1 was introduced in 1937 @xcite .",
    "it is an enlargement of the symmetric group @xmath2 , designed to impose an orthosymplectic algebraic condition , depending on @xmath3 , on a schur - weyl dual algebraic group over the complex field",
    ". however it may be defined over an arbitrary ring @xmath4 , for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it has integral representations ( in the sense of @xcite ) that pass to simple modules over suitable splitting fields ( sometimes called cell modules in modern parlance ) , constructed by brown @xcite .",
    "this raises the problem of determining simple decomposition matrices for these key modules ( and hence for indecomposable projective modules ) over other extensions @xmath7 ( @xmath7 a field equipped with the property of @xmath4-algebra ) .",
    "this long - standing problem remains open .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold : to develop some tools to solve this problem , by constructing a formal ` weight space ' with a geometry and associated functors on the module categories , and to propose a possible combinatorial framework ( at least over @xmath8 ) in which the answer might be couched .",
    "the problem can be addressed in two parts : first working over @xmath8 , and then over fields of prime characteristic .",
    "( the latter can be anticipated to be significantly harder , as the representation theory of @xmath1 _ contains _ the representation theory of the symmetric group @xmath2 . ) a significant step towards an answer came with the determinantion in 2005 of the blocks of the algebra over @xmath8 ( and in 2006 of a geometric linkage principle in any characteristic different from @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained by using functors that allow the algebras for all @xmath10 to be treated together ( as previously used in @xcite ) .",
    "( an alternative approach to the characteristic @xmath0 result via characteristic @xmath11 has recently been developed by donkin and tange @xcite . )    the key observation that underpins the various geometric considerations in this paper is that the cell modules of @xmath1 may be indexed by certain orbits of lattice points in the euclidean space @xmath12 .",
    "the orbits are those of a reflection group @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the limit of the usual type-@xmath13 reflection group action on euclidean @xmath14-space @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath13-action is a parabolic in the limit type-@xmath16 reflection group action on @xmath12 ( as in finite rank ) , and the orbits of the @xmath16-action on coset space @xmath17 describe the blocks of @xmath1-mod over @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason we will work over @xmath8 in this paper . using this parabolic / reflection group formulation we are able to :    1",
    ".   determine a translation principle ( morita equivalences between certain blocks ) ; 2 .",
    "compute appropriate brauer analogues of the parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials that determine decomposition matrices in lie ( quantum group ) theory ; 3 .",
    "use these to encode the structure of the algebra in many special cases ( for example in low rank , with the obvious conjecture that this extends to all cases ) .",
    "our methodology , and the structure of the paper , can be summarised as follows .",
    "the well - established root system / weyl group analysis of high - weight theory reduces many questions in lie representation theory ( of algebraic and quantum groups ) to geometry and combinatorics @xcite , once the weyl group and affine weyl group action on weight space has been determined . of",
    "course these weyl groups are reflection groups , one a parabolic in the other @xcite , facilitating , for example , an alcove geometric description of blocks .",
    "note the obvious analogy with the role of reflection groups described above .",
    "it was this which motivated our formulation of the results in @xcite ( guided by success with a similar approach to other ` diagram ' algebras @xcite ) .",
    "in lie theory the euclidean space is finite and the reflection group is infinite by virtue of being affine ; here it is by virtue of unbounded rank .",
    "nonetheless , all the geometric and combinatorial machinery goes through unchanged .",
    "the development of this analogy in section [ weyl ] lies at the heart of our methodology .",
    "arguably one of the most beautiful machines that exists for computing decomposition matrices in any setting is the method of ( parabolic ) kazhdan - lusztig polynomials in lie theory @xcite .",
    "not all of the assumptions of this set - up hold for the brauer algebra , but in section [ klp ] we show how to bring the two theories close enough together that parabolic kazhdan - lusztig ( pkl ) polynomials suitable for the brauer algebra may be computed .    in the group ( or quantum group ) case one has pkl polynomials associated to alcoves in the alcove geometry , determining ( at least for the @xmath18-group over @xmath8 , and its ringel dual hecke algebra quotient @xcite ) decomposition matrices in alcove blocks . in general",
    "there is more than one block intersecting an alcove , but there is also a translation principle @xcite , which states that all these blocks are morita equivalent , and hence do indeed have the same decomposition matrices . in our case",
    "the pkl method formally assigns the same decomposition matrix to every alcove block .",
    "one is therefore led to seek a form of translation principle .",
    "the brauer algebras @xmath1 as @xmath10 varies form a tower via an idempotent construction .",
    "in @xcite we gave a general axiom scheme for studying such a tower as a _ tower of recollement_. the advantage of studying algebras in such a tower is the existence of four functors : induction , restriction , globalisation , and localisation , which relate the representation theories of the different algebras in a compatible manner .    in section [ towermor ] we will show how towers of recollement , when combined with a suitable description of the blocks in the tower , give rise to analogues of translation functors and corresponding morita equivalences . these functors are defined using induction or restriction functors followed by projection onto a block , and are similar in spirit to @xmath19-induction and @xmath19-restriction functors for the symmetric group @xcite .",
    "we apply this translation theory to the brauer algebras in section [ brauertran ] , with the aim of proving that two blocks corresponding to weights in the same facet have the same representation theory ( corollary [ sumup ] ) .",
    "however , in order to do this we will need some additional functors , generalisations of induction and restriction , which are introduced in section [ genir ] .",
    "we will also see that when @xmath20 there are translation equivalences _ between _ certain facets , which raises interesting questions as to the true geometric structure underlying the representation theory .",
    "we can also consider an analogue of translation onto a wall  in lie theory for towers of recollement . using this we show that the decomposition matrix for the brauer algebra is determined by the decomposition matrix for the block containing the weight @xmath0 ( theorem [ need0 ] ) .",
    "in section [ manygraphs ] we consider various graphs associated to each block ( or each facet ) , and show that they are in fact all isomorphic",
    ". for alcove graphs we can define associated kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ; using the graph isomorphisms these polynomials can more generally be associated to any block graph . in the final section",
    "we show that when @xmath21 these polynomials correctly predict decomposition numbers and filtrations in the alcove case for standard modules in low rank examples .",
    "in this section we will very briefly summarise the basic representation theory of the brauer algebras that will be needed in what follows .",
    "details can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict our attention to the case where the ground field is @xmath8 .",
    "the brauer algebra @xmath1 is a finite dimensional algebra with parameter @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath23 this algebra is semisimple , so we will henceforth assume that @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "_ we will also assume that @xmath24 .",
    "_    it will be convenient to use the usual graphical presentation of brauer algebras .",
    "an _ @xmath25 brauer algebra diagram _ will consists of a rectangular frame with @xmath10 marked points on the northern edge and @xmath26 on the southern edge called _ nodes_. each of these sets will be numbered from @xmath27 to @xmath10 ( respectively @xmath26 ) from left to right .",
    "each node is joined to precisely one other by a line ; lines connecting the northern and southern edge will be called _ propagating lines _ and the remainder _ ( northern or southern ) arcs_.    multiplication of two @xmath28 diagrams is by concatenation , where any diagram obtained with a closed loop is set equal to @xmath3 times the same diagram with the loop removed .",
    "two diagrams are equivalent if they connect the same pairs of nodes .",
    "the algebra obtained by taking linear combinations of @xmath28 diagrams is a realisation of @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath30 is isomorphic to the subalgebra of @xmath31 spanned by diagram with only propagating lines .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 is generated by this subalgebra together with the elements @xmath32 with @xmath33 consisting of @xmath34 propagating lines and arcs joining @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the northern ( respectively ) southern edges .",
    "the brauer algebra can also be constructed via iterated inflations of the symmetric group @xcite , and thus is a cellular algebra . if @xmath24 , then it is even quasihereditary .",
    "the standard modules @xmath37 are parameterised by partitions of @xmath38 ( where the final term depends on the parity of @xmath10 ) , and we will denote the set of such by @xmath39 . if @xmath24 then the same set parameterises the simple modules .",
    "we have the following explicit construction of standard modules .",
    "consider a brauer diagram with @xmath10 northern nodes and @xmath40 southern nodes , and with no southern arcs .",
    "such a diagram must have exactly @xmath41 northern arcs .",
    "we will denote this diagram by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the configuration of northern arcs , @xmath27 represents the fixed southern boundary , and @xmath44 is the permutation obtained by setting @xmath45 if the @xmath35th propagating northern node from the left is connected to the southern node labelled by @xmath36 .",
    "the elements @xmath43 arising as above will be called _ partial one - row diagrams _ , and the set of such will be denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "if a node @xmath35 in @xmath47 is not part of a northern arc we say that it is _",
    "free_. the vector space spanned by the set of diagrams of the form @xmath48 where @xmath47 will be denoted @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath50 acts on @xmath49 on the right by permuting the southern nodes .",
    "given @xmath51 a partition of @xmath52 , let @xmath53 denote the specht module corresponding to @xmath51 for @xmath50",
    ". then the standard module @xmath37 can be realised ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) in the following manner . as a vector space",
    "we have @xmath54 an element @xmath55 of @xmath29 acts on @xmath56 from the right by diagram multiplication .",
    "if the resulting product has fewer than @xmath26 propagating lines then we define the action of @xmath55 on @xmath57 to be @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise the product will result in a diagram with exactly @xmath26 propagating lines , but these may now be permuted .",
    "we transfer this permutation ( thought of as an element of @xmath58 ) through the tensor product to act on @xmath53 .    for @xmath24 ( or @xmath59",
    "there is an idempotent @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , and so there are associated localisation and globalisation functors @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this way we can regard @xmath64 as a full subcategory of @xmath65 , and hence @xmath66 .",
    "we set @xmath67 , the set of all partitions .",
    "we will abuse terminology and say that two labels are in the same block when the associated standard modules are in the same block .    in order to describe the main results in @xcite",
    "we will need some additional terminology .",
    "recall that for a partition @xmath51 ( which we will identify with its young diagram ) , the _ content _ of the box in row @xmath35 and column @xmath36 of the diagram is defined to be @xmath68 .",

    "we wish to identify reflection groups associated to the brauer algebra which play the role of the weyl and affine weyl groups for reductive algebraic groups .",
    "first let us recall the properties of weyl groups which we wish to replicate .    in lie theory",
    "a weyl group @xmath135 is a reflection group acting on a euclidean weight space with the following properties :    1 .",
    "there is an integral set of weights on which @xmath135 acts via a dot action @xmath136 , 2 .",
    "the reflection hyperplanes of @xmath135 under this action break space up into chambers ( and other facets ) , 3 .",
    "a complete set of weights indexing simple ( or standard ) modules coincides with the weights in a single chamber under the dot action , namely that containing the zero weight .",
    "such weights are said to be _",
    "dominant_.    thus the selection of an indexing set for the dominant weights is taken care of by the weyl group ( and its dot action ) . in positive characteristic @xmath11 or at a quantum @xmath137th root of unity",
    "there is then a second stage , the introduction of an affine extension of @xmath135 ( with action depending on @xmath11 or @xmath137 ) , which has orbits whose intersection with the dominant weights determine the blocks .",
    "this affine extension defines an additional set of reflecting hyperplanes , which break the set of weights up into a series of chambers ( now called alcoves ) and other facets .",
    "we refer to this configuration of facets , together with the action of the affine extension , as the _ alcove geometry _ associated to the particular lie theory in question .    the alcove geometry controls much of the representation theory of the corresponding reductive group . in particular",
    ", we typically have a _ translation principle _ which says that there are morita equivalences between blocks which intersect a given facet , and so much of the representation theory does not depend on the weight itself but only on the facet in which it lies .",
    "we will show how a version of the above programme can be implemented for the brauer algebra from scratch .",
    "let @xmath138 be the @xmath139-vector space with basis @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "we will define various reflections on @xmath138 corresponding to the standard action of the type @xmath16 weyl group .",
    "let @xmath142 be the reflection in the hyperplane in @xmath138 through the origin which takes @xmath143 to @xmath144 and fixes all other unit vectors , and @xmath145 to be the reflection in the hyperplane perpendicular to @xmath146 which takes @xmath143 to @xmath147 .",

    "as explained in the previous section , the brauer algebras @xmath1 as @xmath10 varies form a tower .",
    "thus it is natural to consider all such algebras simultaneously . in order to do this",
    "we will work with the infinite rank case .",
    "note also that orbits of the finite weyl group @xmath150 are not sufficient to define an indexing set for the simple @xmath1-modules ( one needs to consider @xmath151-orbits , but then this group is not a subgroup of @xmath152 ) , unlike the infinite rank case .",

    "in summary , we have shown that there is a space that plays a role analogous to a weight space ( in lie theory ) for the brauer algebra , together with an action of the type @xmath13 coxeter group which plays the role of the weyl group , while the corresponding type @xmath16 coxeter group plays the role of the affine weyl group .",
