    "in the last twenty - five years the spin structure of the nucleon led to a very productive experimental and theoretical activity with exciting results and new challenges@xcite .",
    "this investigation has included a variety of aspects , such as testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , in its perturbative regime _ _ v__ia spin sum rules ( like the bjorken sum rule@xcite ) and understanding how the spin of the nucleon is built from the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the theory , quarks and gluons .",
    "recently , results from a new generation of experiments performed at jefferson lab seeking to probe the theory in its non - perturbative and transition regimes have reached a mature state .",
    "the low momentum - transfer results offer insight in a region known for the collective behavior of the nucleon constituents and their interactions . in this region",
    "it has been more economical to describe the nucleon using effective degrees of freedom like mesons and constituent quarks rather than current quarks and gluons .",
    "furthermore , distinct features seen in the nucleon response to the electromagnetic probe , depending on the resolution of the probe , point clearly to different regimes of description , i.e. a scaling regime where quark - gluon correlations are suppressed versus a coherent regime where long - range interactions give rise to the static properties of the nucleon .    in this review",
    "we describe an investigation@xcite of the spin structure of the nucleon through the measurement of the helicity - dependent photoabsorption cross sections or asymmetries using virtual photons across a wide resolution spectrum .",
    "these observables are used to extract the spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath3 and evaluate their moments .",
    "these moments are powerful tools to test qcd sum rules and unravel some aspects of the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "sum rules involving the spin structure of the nucleon offer an important opportunity to study qcd . in recent years the bjorken sum rule at large @xmath4 ( 4-momentum transfer squared ) and the gerasimov , drell and hearn ( gdh ) sum rule@xcite at @xmath5 have attracted large experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite efforts that have provided us with rich information .",
    "this first type of sum rules relates the moments of the spin structure functions ( or , equivalently , the spin - dependent total photoabsorption cross sections ) to the nucleon s static properties .",
    "the second type of sum rules , such as the generalized gdh sum rule@xcite or the polarizability sum rules@xcite , relate the moments of the spin structure functions to real or virtual compton amplitudes , which can be calculated theoretically .",
    "both types of sum rules are based on `` unsubtracted '' dispersion relations and the optical theorem@xcite .",
    "the first type of sum rules uses one more general assumption , such as a low - energy theorem@xcite for the gdh sum rule and operator production expansion ( ope)@xcite for the bjorken sum rule , to relate the compton amplitude to a static property .",

    "<S> the nucleon has been used as a laboratory to investigate its own spin structure and quantum chromodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> new experimental data on nucleon spin structure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high momentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture of the transition region from the _ confinement _ regime of the theory to its _ </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic freedom _ regime . </S>",
    "<S> insight for some aspects of the theory is gained by exploring lower moments of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules ( i.e. the gerasimov - drell - hearn , bjorken and burkhardt - cottingham ) . </S>",
    "<S> these moments are expressed in terms of an operator - product expansion using quark and gluon degrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rules are verified to good accuracy assuming that no singular behavior of the structure functions is present at very high excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - twist contributions have been examined through the moments evolution as the momentum transfer varies from higher to lower values . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , qcd - inspired low - energy effective theories , which explicitly include chiral symmetry breaking , are tested at low momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of these theories is further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that chiral perturbation calculations agree reasonably well with the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath0 at momentum transfer of 0.1 gev@xmath1 but fail to reproduce the neutron data in the case of the generalized polarizability @xmath2 . </S>"
