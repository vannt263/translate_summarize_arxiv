    "the available @xmath0 branching ratios come from dmii  @xcite and markiii  @xcite ; these measurements have relative errors of about 18% . here",

    "furthermore , there is a prediction of the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay branching ratios to the same hadronic final state ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , that is @xmath9 while some channels obey the so called `` 12% rule '' , others violate this rule very badly  @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to test this rule for @xmath7 decay , which can only be produced through su(3 ) symmetry - breaking , strong decays of these charmonium states .",
    "the data used for this analysis are taken with the besii detector at the bepc storage ring at a center - of - mass energy corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "the data sample corresponds to a total of @xmath11 @xmath2 decays , as determined from inclusive 4-prong hadrons  @xcite .",

    "an array of 48 scintillation counters surrounding the mdc measures the time - of - flight ( tof ) of charged tracks with a resolution of @xmath18 ps for hadrons .",

    "a monte carlo simulation is used for the determinations of the mass resolution and detection efficiency . this program ( simbes ) , which is geant3 based , simulates the detector response , including the interactions of secondary particles with the detector material . reasonable agreement between data and monte carlo simulation",
    "has been observed in various channels tested , including @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 .    for the signal channel , @xmath0 , the angular distribution of the @xmath28 or @xmath29",

    "m inclusive @xmath2 decays generated with lundcharm  @xcite is used for background estimation .",
    "for the decay channel of interest , the candidate events must satisfy the following selection criteria :    1 .",
    "two charged tracks with net charge zero are required .",
    "2 .   each track should satisfy @xmath33 , where @xmath31 is the polar angle in the mdc , and have a good helix fit so that the error matrix from track fitting is available for secondary vertex finding .",
    "3 .   to remove backgrounds mainly from @xmath34 , @xmath35  gev is required , where @xmath36 is the sum of the energies of the photon candidates outside a cone about the direction of the @xmath29 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "a neutral cluster is considered to be a photon candidate when the angle between the nearest charged track and the cluster in the @xmath38 plane is greater than @xmath39 , the first energy deposit is in the beginning 6 radiation lengths , and the angle between the cluster development direction in the bsc and the photon emission direction in the @xmath38 plane is less than @xmath40 .",

    "the cluster of events with mass consistent with the nominal @xmath28 mass and with a long decay length indicates a clear @xmath28 signal .",
    "figure  [ mks - j ] shows the @xmath5 invariant mass distributions of both data and monte carlo simulation .",
    "a fit with a gaussian and a second order polynomial background gives a @xmath28 mass of @xmath44 and mass resolution of @xmath45 for data , while the corresponding numbers are @xmath46 and @xmath47 for monte carlo simulation .",
    "the masses for data and monte carlo simulation agree well , although both of them deviate from the world average mass @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the mass resolution from monte carlo simulation is smaller than that of data .",
    "figure  [ lxy - j ] shows the comparison of the @xmath28 decay length distributions between data and monte carlo simulation after normalizing the monte carlo data to the number of events with @xmath49  cm .",
    "the discrepancy below 1  cm indicates the still remaining non-@xmath28 background events in the sample .",
    "the difference at @xmath50  cm will be discussed later .    after requiring @xmath51  cm and the @xmath5 mass within twice the mass resolution around the nominal @xmath28 mass and removing the @xmath52 conversion background ( described later ) ,",
    "the @xmath28 momentum distribution is shown in figure  [ pksfit - j ] . in the plot",
    ", there is a clear peak around 1.46  gev/@xmath22 corresponding to @xmath0 decays , and another peak around 1.37  gev/@xmath22 corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "the background , as estimated from the @xmath28 mass side bands ( three sigma away from the @xmath28 nominal mass on both sides ) , can explain the contribution in the high momentum region , while in the lower momentum region , there are additional backgrounds due to other channels with @xmath28 production .",
    "the secondary vertex requirement and invariant mass cut are very effective in reducing backgrounds from non-@xmath28 events .",
    "however since there is no particle identification requirement for the tracks used , there is contamination from @xmath53 where one photon converts into an @xmath54 pair which passes the above selection criteria .",
    "this background can be seen in figure  [ conv - j ] , where the total bsc energy versus the total momentum of the charged tracks is shown .",
    "the events with high total momentum and large bsc energies in the upper right corner of the figure are due to this gamma conversion background .",
    "figure  [ scexse - j ] shows a scatter plot of the total bsc energy versus the total @xmath55 ( difference from the expected @xmath12 for the electron hypothesis divided by the @xmath12 resolution ) of the two charged tracks for events with @xmath28 momentum larger than 1.45  gev/@xmath22 for both data and monte carlo simulation .",
    "it can be seen that requiring a total bsc energy greater than 1.0  gev and total @xmath55 greater than @xmath56 will select almost all the gamma conversion background , while the efficiency of this cut for the signal is very high ( about 99.0% according to monte carlo simulation ) .",
    "figure  [ pks - gconv - j ] shows the distributions of events identified as gamma conversions for data and monte carlo simulated signal events .",
    "there is no indication of signal in the expected momentum region for @xmath0 events .",
    "the @xmath52 conversion events can also be removed by cutting on the the opening angle between the two charged tracks ; a requirement that the opening angle be larger than @xmath57 removes about the same fraction of background events with about the same efficiency for signal events as the cuts used above .",
    "this indicates the reliability of the cuts used for gamma conversion rejection .",
    "since there is no photon production in @xmath7 events , one expects no photons reconstructed in the candidate events .",
    "however the @xmath29 may decay in the detector , and the decay products or hadronic interactions of the @xmath29 with the detector material can produce clusters in the shower counter . as a check , we required the number of photon candidates in the event to be zero ( about 45% of @xmath7 events satisfy this cut according to monte carlo simulation ) .",
    "figure  [ pksngm - j ] shows the @xmath28 momentum distribution after this cut .",
    "it is clear that the background level , including the peak corresponding to @xmath34 , is greatly reduced , while the peak at high momentum is lowered by about a factor of two as expected from monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xmath7 production via virtual photon annihilation is forbidden under su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "this is checked by applying the same selection criteria to the data sample taken below the @xmath2 peak , at @xmath58  gev .",
    "this data was taken during the @xmath2 data taking , and the integrated luminosity is measured to be @xmath59 .    the @xmath28 momentum spectrum of the selected events is shown in figure  [ pks-3.0 ] ; the events in the signal region agree well with the expectation from the @xmath28 mass sidebands . as a conservative estimation , we take all the events with momentum within two standard deviation from the central value predicted by the monte carlo as signal to set the upper limit on the production cross section . for",
    "the two observed @xmath60 candidates , the upper limit on the cross section at the 90% c.  l. is @xmath61    the integrated luminosity of the @xmath2 data sample is estimated to be around 17.8  pb@xmath62  @xcite , approximately 25 times as large as the continuum sample .",
    "since the efficiencies for detecting @xmath7 at the @xmath2 and at @xmath58  gev are about the same , we estimate the continuum contribution of @xmath7 at the @xmath2 to be at most 50 events , which is small compared to the number of events observed at the @xmath2 ( more than 2000 ) . since the lack of evidence for @xmath7 production from the continuum agrees well with the su(3 ) symmetry prediction , this contribution is neglected in the following analysis .",
    "figure  [ pksdtmc - j ] shows the @xmath28 momentum spectrum obtained for the inclusive monte carlo events after all cuts and after normalizing to the total number of @xmath2 events .",
    "it can be seen that there are also two peaks at the expected positions for @xmath63 and @xmath7 as has been observed with data .",
    "the monte carlo simulation reproduces the shape of the peaks , but is lower than the data .",
    "this indicates the branching ratios used in the monte carlo simulation are too low .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath0 in the generator is @xmath64 , and that of @xmath34 is @xmath65 .",
    "the main background in the intermediate @xmath28 momentum region is due to @xmath34 where the @xmath66 decays into @xmath67 and a @xmath68 , and one @xmath67 becomes a @xmath28 and the other becomes a @xmath29 .",
    "another potential background is due to @xmath69 , which has a large branching ratio , but this background is included in the @xmath28 side band events .",
    "the background from @xmath70 , with @xmath71 decaying into final states containing a @xmath28 can also contaminate the signal , but this background is small because @xmath71 production is two orders of magnitude lower than @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ pksfit - j ] shows the @xmath28 momentum distribution for the background channels with the input branching fraction of @xmath34 taken to be @xmath72 , obtained from a preliminary analysis of the same data sample , together with the contribution from the @xmath28 mass side band events .",
    "the agreement between the background estimation and data is good below the @xmath7 peak , indicating the estimation of the background under the @xmath7 peak is reliable .",
    "the discrepancy at lower momentum indicates backgrounds from other channels ( like @xmath73 , @xmath74 , etc . ) , which are not generated in this comparison , are important , but they do not affect the results in the signal region .",
    "the @xmath28 momentum spectrum of the selected events is fitted from 1.37 to 1.60  gev/@xmath22 with a gaussian distribution for the signal , a constant term for the non-@xmath28 background , and an exponential term for the background from @xmath34 using an unbinned maximum likelihood method .",
    "the fit results are shown in figure  [ pksfit - j ] ; the backgrounds from the @xmath28 mass side bands and the @xmath34 background , also shown , agrees well with the fitted background .",
    "the fitted @xmath28 momentum peak is at @xmath75  mev/@xmath22 , which agrees well with the expectation of @xmath76  mev/@xmath22 .",
    "the fitted momentum resolution is @xmath77  mev/@xmath22 , which is in good agreement with that of the monte carlo simulation , @xmath78  mev/@xmath22 .",
    "the fit yields @xmath79 events , and the efficiency for detecting @xmath0 , with @xmath80 is @xmath81 from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the systematic error in the branching ratio measurement comes from uncertainties in the efficiencies of the photon energy cut , secondary vertex finding , mdc tracking , and the trigger ; the branching ratios used ; the number of @xmath2 events ; the @xmath28 mass cut ; the angular distributions ; etc .      according to the monte carlo simulation , the @xmath36 cut has an efficiency of 93.6% for @xmath0 events , while many backgrounds are removed .",
    "the energy is produced in signal events by the decays and hadronic interactions of the @xmath29 with the detector material ; the simulation of this effect depends strongly on the detector simulation software .",
    "this is checked with the @xmath0 signal , requiring the @xmath28 momentum greater than 1.45  gev/@xmath22 and less than 1.50  gev/@xmath22 .",
