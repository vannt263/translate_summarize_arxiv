    "for the past 30 years several attempts have been made , with little success , to describe nuclear matter in terms of its constituent quarks .",
    "the main difficulty is due to the non - perturbative nature of qcd .",
    "the only rigorous method for handling multi - quark systems to date is lattice qcd .",
    "however , this is very computationally intensive and given the magnitude of the problem it appears unlikely to be useful in the near future . as a result",
    ", more phenomenological means must be considered .",
    "a good phenomenological model should be able to at least reproduce qualitatively all the overall bulk properties of nuclear matter .",
    "in particular ,    * nucleon gas at low densities with no van der waals forces * nucleon binding at higher densities * nucleon swelling and saturation of nuclear forces with increasing density * quark gas at extremely high densities    there are several models that attempt to reproduce these properties but none of them does so completely . in this paper , only the string - flip potential model  @xcite , will be considered .",
    "this model appears to be promising because it reproduces most of the aforementioned properties with the exception of nucleon binding : instead of producing a binding of about 8 mev at nuclear density , one finds anti - binding of about 25 mev .",
    "however , various efffects have been ignored , such as colour coulomb and hyperfine forces , relativistic effects and many - quark clusters . in this paper",
    "we attempt to understand why , in terms of a toy mesonic molecular system  @xcite .",
    "the idea of string - flip potential models derives from lattice qcd and meson spectroscopy . a static potential derived from computations in lattice qcd @xmath1",
    "is confirmed as a phenomenologically satisfactory potential model between quarks and antiquarks by fitting the experimental mesonic spectra .",
    "this is basically an interpolation between the long range non - perturbative ( @xmath2 ) and short range perturbative ( @xmath3 ) parts of the force between pairs of quarks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qqpair ] ) . in the many - body case",
    ", the string - flip potential model ignores the short range part of the potential and considers an ensemble of quark - antiquark pairs , @xmath4 , such that the total string length , @xmath5 , is a minimum : _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6    this particular model has been used in an attempt to simulate nuclear matter .",
    "although it has an obvious shortcoming , in that it is more applicable to a pion gas , it does surprisingly well at predicting some of the overall bulk properties of nuclear matter  @xcite .    in a previous paper , we have extended this simple model to a more realistic one which involves triplets of quarks . here",
    "the flux - tubes leaving each quark meets at a central vertex such that overall length , @xmath7 , of `` flux - tubing '' is minimized ( _ cf_. fig .",
    "[ fg : figa ] ) .",
    "the potential energy is simply @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the effects of this are surprisingly small in going from @xmath9 to @xmath10 : a nucleon gas still forms , and becomes a quark gas above a certain critical density .",
    "these models are motivated by results from lattice qcd , where variations are taken about minimal lattice field configurations between quarks .",
    "we will refer to these , `` linear potential models , '' as , `` @xmath11 models , '' where the @xmath12 refers to the @xmath13 yang - mills gauge group and the subscript , `` @xmath14 , '' refers to , `` linear potential , '' @xcite . in some models",
    "each quark has fixed colour to simplify the searches for minimal flux - tube configurations as the system of quarks evolves .",
    "when necessary , for clarity , these models will be referred to as , `` @xmath15 models . ''",
    "this paper is divided into four sections : the first discusses the problems faced when attempts are made to extend the string - flip potential model to include perturbative qcd interactions for many - body systems .",
    "this is followed by a section on mesonic molecules , where the problems faced with the string - flip potential model and its extensions are examined in detail . in the next we examine a modified wave function , which appears to solve many of the difficulties .",
    "the final section reviews all of the findings and their possible consequences for modeling nuclear matter .",
    "it appears from earlier work that the string - flip potential model is incapable of producing nuclear binding without the addition of new interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to introduce these into a many - body model .",
    "a model was recently proposed , called the flux - bubble model  @xcite , which does allow the perturbative qcd effects to be included .",
    "the primary objective is to construct a model which combines both the nonperturbative ( flux - tubes ) and perturbative ( one - gluon exchange ) aspects of qcd in a consistent fashion . in order to simplify this task only colour - coulomb extensions to a linear potential model using @xmath9 colour , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 , will be considered .",
    "the conventional phenomenological potential ,    @xmath17 , ( [ eq : phenpot ] )    mentioned in ",
    "[ sc : foo ] does not extend naturally to many - body systems , since the @xmath18 must be replaced by @xmath19 for unlike and like colours respectively .",
    "this gives rise to a van der waals potential between colourless nucleons with a @xmath20 behaviour .",
    "the flux bubble modifies this to @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the major difference is that the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes are completely separated in the latter , so that there are no van der waals forces . , and",
    "the linear term is turned on by a similar function .",
    "this makes a negligible difference to our results . ]",
    "when the quarks are separated at a distance greater than r@xmath23 the potential is purely linear and when they are inside this radius it is purely coulomb . in effect , for distances less than r@xmath23 , a `` bubble '' is formed in which the quarks are free to move around , in an asymptotically free fashion . in both distance",
    "regimes the net colour of the system is neutral , and phenomenologically the models are almost identical for a single @xmath0 system .",
    "this extension of the linear potential , although simple for a pair of quarks , becomes more complex when considering many pairs of quarks . in particular , it is difficult to construct a potential model when some set of quarks lie within @xmath24 , without forming a colour singlet so that they must be connected to more distant quarks by flux - tubes .",
    "ansatz _ that satisfies these requirements is obtained by inserting virtual @xmath0 pairs across any of the intersection boundaries formed by the flux - tubes with the bubbles .",
    "now the segments of flux - tubes that lie outside the bubbles remain intact while the segments inside simply dissolve .",
    "[ fig : fluxbubble ] illustrates the dynamics of this model .",
    "note the insertion of the virtual @xmath25 pairs allows the construction of colourless objects .",
    "these are solely used as a tool to calculate the overall length of the flux - tube correctly , and not used in computing the coulomb term however , as the field energy is already taken into account by the `` real '' quarks inside the bubbles . in general ,",
    "once the bubbles have been determined , the flux - tubes must be reconfigured in order to minimize the linear part of the potential .",
    "although the model is currently for @xmath16 it would be straightforward to extend it to a full @xmath26 model with all the one - gluon exchange phenomena .    in the previous case for the @xmath27 model , given in ref .",

    "@xmath32 gives the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "] we were able to use a scaling trick to reduce the number of variation degrees of freedom to one , since @xmath28 and @xmath29 varied parametrically with a single parameter , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 where @xmath35\\sim   fm^{-1}$ ] .",
    "however , for the flux - bubble potential , this scaling transformation is broken .",
    "this extra degree of freedom greatly increases the computation time , since we must now perform a 2-dimensional minimization .",
    "we have , however , been able to show that the results of the computation are qualitatively similar to previous results @xcite : in other words , the flux bubble does not give rise to additional binding .",
    "however , to obtain satisfactory results requires a coarse @xmath36 mesh of points , in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and hence 18hrs of cpu time on an 8 node farm .",
    "clearly this procedure would be ridiculously slow if more parameters were to be added .",
    "thus a rapid method of checking different wave functions , minimization procedures and various aspects of the string - flip and flux - bubble potential models is desirable .",
    "a possible mini - laboratory is a mesonic - molecule  @xcite , @xmath37 , consisting of two heavy quarks and two relatively light antiquarks : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mesmol].the quarks are assumed to be heavy so that the light antiquarks can move around freely without disturbing their positions : _ i.e. _ , the born - oppenheimer approximation is valid . by varying the distance , r , between the heavy quarks a mesonic - molecular potential , @xmath38 , can be computed .",
    "the schrdinger equation that describes the effective potential , @xmath39 , is given by @xcite @xmath40 we shall assume @xmath41 .",
    "the potential @xmath42 describes the many - body nature of the four quark system , and is therefore model dependent .",
    "this equation can be solved variationally for @xmath43 , at fixed values of @xmath44 , by guessing at the form of the wave function , @xmath45 , and minimizing @xmath46 with respect to the parameters in @xmath45 .",
    "the expectation values @xmath47 and @xmath48 are found by using the metropolis algorithm @xcite , and the optimal parameters for @xmath45 are found by using the distributed minimization algorithm  @xcite on @xmath49 .",
    "this was developed to handle the problem of reducing cpu overhead .",
    "it involves the usage of several @xmath50 s to perform interlaced parabolic searches for the minima of a given surface . for the @xmath37 system this algorithm yields @xmath51 for @xmath52 parameters and @xmath53 computers : similar results are expected for nuclear matter calculations .",
    "the @xmath37 system provides a good way of checking potential models for the possibility of nuclear ( mesonic ) binding . because of its simplicity",
    ", it allows for investigating various wave functions and minimization schemes with minimal computational effort .",
    "a final useful feature is that the integration can be reduced to a 4-d one if coulomb interactions are ignored , and a 5-d one if they are included .",
    "this allows us to avoid the metropolis procedure entirely , and use multi - dimensional gaussian methods , which we use a check on the monte - carlo methods      when the @xmath16 string - flip potential model was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite the parameter @xmath31 in the variational wave function , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : watold ] , was fixed by requiring that it minimize the total energy at zero density . since",
    "this could be done analytically it allowed for a reduction in the number of variational parameters used in the monte carlo .",
    "it was assumed that constraining @xmath31 would have very little effect on the physics as a function of density since the results only vary by about 1% for @xmath54 at zero density .",
    "the validity of this claim can now be checked more thoroughly by using the @xmath37 mini - laboratory .",

    "regardless , looking at the maximum fluctuations about the central values of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath29 , and @xmath61 we have @xcite @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , which is certainly less then a 1% effect in the total energy @xcite .",
    "however the relative energy @xmath65 depends critically on the variational procedure .",

    "there is a barrier and beyond this no more structure .",
    "this apparently bizarre result can be understood as follows : if two mesons , each containing a heavy quark and a light anti - quark , are brought together from infinity they initially feel a repulsive force . however",
    ", it then becomes energetically preferable for the two mesons to dissociate into one meson containing two heavy quarks and another containing two light anti - quarks .",
    "this arises since the model has a pauli - gursey symmetry  @xcite : quarks and antiquarks have the same representations .",
    "although potentially realistic as a description of meson - anti - meson interaction , the @xmath108 with moving colour does not make a satisfactory model for nuclear matter .    from this discussion , it is clear that the extensions to the string - flip potential model to include the colour - coulomb interactions have essentially no effect on the @xmath37 potential , and certainly will not give rise to nuclear binding .",
    "furthermore , the string - flip potential does not give a long - range interaction similar to pion exchange .",
    "when the colour was allowed to move around a highly unphysical situation occurs which suggested that there was perhaps a problem with using @xmath84 or with the variational wave function itself  perhaps even both . in the next section",
    "we investigate an alternative wave - function .",
    "the two previous sections have shown that modifying the potential or modifying the variational procedure produces a relatively small effect on the @xmath37 interaction .",

    "a hint is to note the similarity between the @xmath37 mesonic - molecular system and @xmath109 molecular system .",
    "the key reason for the molecular binding is the screening effect caused by the electrons which are for the most part localized in between the protons .",

    "therefore , in @xmath16 for a many quark system this would suggest the following @xmath111 : @xmath143 where @xmath144 @xmath145 is a totally symmetric pseudo - hydrogen wave function and @xmath146 is a totally antisymmetric slater wave function .    for the full three - quark system a similar wave function would apply .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that this wave function would lead to nuclear binding , but , given the order of magnitude of increase in the @xmath37 well depth it would seem quite plausible that it might be a strong enough effect to produce a shallow well in the nuclear - binding - energy curve .",
    "a simple test would be to consider @xmath16 with just a string - flip potential , with @xmath31 fixed , in which case scaling is restored and the monte carlo becomes quite straightforward to do .",
    "when the @xmath16 flux - bubble model with moving colour was considered , the results showed that the @xmath37 system dissociated into one light and one heavy meson .",
    "however , this model is not physical : rather we should consider the heavy quarks as a composite of two light quarks and use @xmath147 instead , so that a flux - tube can not form between the two heavy quarks . for this `` composite '' model , the @xmath148 s of potential eq .",

    "if the heavy quarks are considered to be a composite of two light @xmath154 quarks then the effective mass would be about 600 mev , which is a little too small to produce binding in this model , but for masses this low the adiabatic approximation would no longer be valid .",
    "therefore , an interesting possibility would be to consider a many - body @xmath16 or @xmath26 flux - bubble model in which there is an imbalance between the quark and anti - quark masses .",
    "an interesting side effect of the improved wave - function is that it will automatically produce nucleon deformations , which , it has been argued , produce the contact interactions responsible for nuclear binding  @xcite .",
    "further enhancements are expected by going to the full @xmath155 nucleon model , followed by including flux - bubble interactions .",
    "in particular , the colour - hyperfine interaction which is shown by linked cluster expansion models to play a significant role in nuclear processes  @xcite .",
    "the flux - bubble model proved quite successful at combining colour - coulomb interactions with flux - tube interactions .",
    "although these interactions had very little effect on the @xmath37 system , it was useful in demonstrating that extending the flux - tube model to include local perturbative qcd interactions can be done .",
    "this is important , since the nuclear hard - core potential is usually believed to have its origin in hyperfine interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would prove most interesting to investigate the effect of adding more perturbative interactions to the @xmath37 system .",
    "it also appears that relativistic effects are unimportant . with the addition of @xmath147 this would lead to a more realistic model of mesonic molecules which perhaps could be tested in the laboratory .",
    "the @xmath37 system has proven to be a very useful aid for trying to sort out the complexities of model building for nuclear matter .",
    "the details of the mechanics , from wave functions to dynamics to practical computing methods , of the flux - bubble model have now been thoroughly investigated .",
    "it appears that the flux - bubble model may prove to be very successful , not only for modeling nuclear matter but also for modeling mesonic molecules as well .",
