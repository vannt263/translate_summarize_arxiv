    "finally section [ sec : summary ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian describing the beryllium atom exposed to a strong magnetic field assuming an infinitely heavy nucleus reads as follows @xmath13 where we have adopted the symmetric gauge for the vector potential and we have employed atomic units . @xmath14 represents the field - dependent one - particle operator containing the zeeman - term @xmath15 , the diamagnetic term @xmath16 , the coulomb interaction with the nucleus @xmath17 as well as the spin zeeman contribution @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is a two - particle operator and represents the electron - electron coulomb repulsion .    in the above hamiltonian the direction of the magnetic field",
    "coincides with the @xmath2axis .",
    "therefore the @xmath2projection of the total orbital angular momentum and of the total spin @xmath20 are conserved .",
    "these yield the good quantum numbers @xmath21 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "furthermore the total spin is conserved and the @xmath22  parity @xmath23 represents a symmetry . in the following we employ the spectroscopic notation @xmath24 for the electronic states , where @xmath25 stands for the degree of excitation of a certain state with given quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "the energies of the electronic bound states are determined by mapping the schrdinger equation to an ordinary eigenvalue problem .",
    "this is done by applying a direct full configuration interaction ( full ci ) approach . for the basis set of atomic orbitals",
    "we choose anisotropic gaussian functions , which have been introduced for atomic and molecular calculations in strong magnetic fields by schmelcher and cederbaum @xcite .",
    "this basis set has been successfully applied to several atoms , ions and molecules @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of it is the flexibility : the anisotropic gaussian functions can be adapted to any ( zero or non zero ) field strength by adjusting the corresponding nonlinear variational parameters . as a result",
    "the convergence properties of the electronic structure calculations using the optimized basis sets ( see below ) are good for any field strengths , although it turns out that for the intrinsically most complex intermediate field regime our approach converges fastest .",
    "the above is in contrast to symmetry adapted basis sets , that have been employed in electronic structure investigations in fields : typically electronic eigenfunctions can be well - described for either low field strengths ( approximate spherical symmetry ) or for very strong fields ( approximate cylindrical symmetry ) but lack to converge in the intermediate field regime .    to take full advantage of the flexibility of the basis functions they have to be optimized for each field strength and each symmetry subspace separately . to this end we determine the primitive gaussian functions by solving different one - particle problems ( be@xmath27 , he@xmath28 and h ) for each field strength . in order to converge rapidly thereby using a minimal number of basis functions , the latter have to be selected very carefully .",
    "the four - electron beryllium calculations start with the computation of the overlap matrix @xmath29 of the gaussian functions .",
    "only those eigenvectors @xmath30 of @xmath31 possessing an eigenvalue above an appropriately chosen threshold @xmath32 are used in the following calculations . as a next step",
    "the schrdinger equation belonging to the one - particle hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) is represented as an ordinary matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "the numerical solution of this eigenvalue problem yields the eigenvectors @xmath33 , which then serve as the spatial part of the one - particle functions for the four - electron investigations .",
    "spinors @xmath34 are constructed as a product of the usual spin eigenfunctions @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the orthogonal functions @xmath33 .",
    "full ci calculations are performed with four - electron slater determinants , which are constructed from spinors , thereby obeying the correct symmetries , i.e. @xmath37    in general the core electrons and specifically the @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbitals , are well described by basis functions that are optimized for the @xmath40- and @xmath41-states of be@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "further basis functions for the full ci calculations of the beryllium atom are obtained by optimizing them for the corresponding one - particle problems of nuclear charge @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for the spin singlet and triplet states of beryllium",
    "exclusively only the hydrogen atom has been employed for the optimization . for the quintet states ,",
    "some of the low - lying orbitals were described by functions optimized for he@xmath28 . to be more specific , for the @xmath44 states functions with one - particle symmetry @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "have been employed .",
    "the same holds for the symmetry subspaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in order to achieve convergence also for the excited states ,",
    "orbitals optimized for the excited states of the @xmath50 symmetry in case of @xmath51 and of the @xmath52 symmetry in case of @xmath53 optimized for hydrogen states are important . for the symmetry subspace @xmath54 we used more functions of the one - particle symmetry",
    "@xmath55 optimized for the ground and excited states of hydrogen .",
    "additionally states for @xmath56 have been used . for",
    "the triplet and quintet symmetry subspace with positive @xmath22-parity and @xmath57 the orbitals of @xmath58 replace those with @xmath59 and @xmath55 . for the quintet symmetry subspaces",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 additionally functions of @xmath62 symmetry character that have been optimized for hydrogen are included in the calculations .",
    "our calculations have been performed using up to 50 one - particle basis functions resulting in @xmath63 slater determinants .",
    "in strong magnetic fields , more precisely in the high field regime , the total energies of bound states of an atomic or molecular system are dominated by the orbital and spin zeeman - contributions on the one hand side and the increase of the kinetic energy on the other hand side .",
    "the kinetic energy depends approximately linear on the field strength ( landau zero point energy of the electrons ) and the contributions of the zeeman terms behave exactly linear with the changing magnetic field strength .",
    "the overall effect of these contributions on the total energies are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alltotal_be ] .",
    "the latter shows the total energies of all 61 calculated bound states possessing negative magnetic quantum numbers as a function of the field strength @xmath9 . in the high field limit",
    "a general pattern can be identified : energy levels corresponding to fully spin polarized states ( @xmath64 ) decrease monotonically with increasing field strength , energy levels belonging to states with @xmath65 pass through a local minimum , and those belonging to states with a positive total spin projection increase monotonically .",
    "this classification of the overall behavior of the energy curves depends exclusively on the spin projection of the states considered .     of all 61 calculated bound states with non positive magnetic quantum number @xmath21 in a.u . as a function of the magnetic field strength @xmath9 .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior of the total energies can be classified by the spin projection @xmath20 . ]    with increasing field strength the ground state of an atom exposed to a magnetic field changes its symmetry i.e. a crossover of several states individually representing the ground state of the atom for a certain interval of field strengths takes place .",
    "the orbital and spin zeeman - terms are important for the identification of the field - dependent global ground state @xcite . beyond this",
    "the magnetically tightly bound orbitals @xcite compared to the non - tightly bound orbitals / states play a central role for the determination of the ground state .",
    "since the ground state is finally obtained by a complicated interplay of the above contributions , the electronic states forming the ground state of the atom depending on the field strength are not predictable _ a priori _ , but have to be determined by explicit electronic structure calculations . for the beryllium atom investigated here , four electronic states representing the global ground state for different field regimes have been found .",
    "this result coincides with an earlier one @xcite based on hartree - fock calculations of the beryllium atom .",
    "having fully correlated results at hand it is now , however , possible to finally conclude on the ground state properties of the atom .",
    "the total energies of the states constituting the ground state are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : groundstate_be ] .",
    "the low field ground state @xmath66 is the highly correlated , doubly tightly bound singlet state @xmath67 .",
    "its total energy increases monotonically as can be observed for all states with a vanishing spin quantum number @xmath68 . in the field regime @xmath69 the global ground state is represented by the triply tightly bound triplet state @xmath70 . concerning the contributions to its total energy",
    "the increase of the kinetic energy is now partly compensated by the spin zeeman - term .",
    "therefore the energy of this state does not monotonically increase with increasing field strength , but passes through a minimum , which is located at @xmath71 .",
    "for @xmath72 the ground state is given by the triplet state @xmath73 which possesses four tightly bound orbitals .",
    "similar to the @xmath70 state , the reader should note , that its total energy passes through a minimum , which , for this state , is located at a higher field strength , compared to the state @xmath70 , namely at @xmath74 . in the high field regime",
    "@xmath75 the spin zeeman - term completely dominates the total energies .",
    "the high field ground state is provided by the quadruply tightly bound state @xmath76 of spin quintet symmetry .",
    "its energy monotonically decreases as a function of the field strength @xmath9 . in the field - free case this state",
    "is unbound .     of the states constituting the ground state of the beryllium atom in a.u .",
    "as a function of the magnetic field strength @xmath9 .",
    "the inset shows a magnification for a certain regime of field strengths . ]",
    "since the zeeman energy and the kinetic energy predominate the total energy of the states and mask the interesting new properties of the atomic states , we will in the following concentrate our discussion on the ionization energies .",
    "these will reveal the binding properties of the corresponding states .",
    "for each symmetry subspace and each field strength , the corresponding ionization threshold has to be identified .",
    "we define here the ionization energy to respect the symmetry properties : the threshold @xmath77 for total magnetic quantum number @xmath21 and @xmath22  projection @xmath20 of the total spin is defined by the equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the total energies of the be@xmath28 ion and the electron , respectively , depending on their magnetic quantum numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",

    "for the states that have already been studied in the literature a comparison of our data shows that our total energies are variationally higher by a relative change of typically @xmath134 or less for the regime of field strengths @xmath216 .",
    "this discrepancy is however not due to limitations of our basis set , which possesses a very high flexibility , but more an effect of the large number of configurations emerging for a four - electron system within a full configuration interaction approach for a given ( moderately sized ) basis set .",
    "going to larger atomic systems it is therefore desirable to choose another configuration interaction approach instead of the full one which allows to treat larger basis sets . for @xmath156",
    "our results are almost exclusively variationally lower than the existing ones in the literature by typical relative deviations of several times @xmath134 .",
    "this confirms the already known feature that our approach performs best in the intermediate regime of field strengths .",
    "p.s . acknowledges fruitful discussions with j. liebert ."
