    "the @xmath0 andromedae ( @xmath0 and ) planetary system is the first multiple planetary system discovered beyond our own solar system around a solar - like star ( butler 1999 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , it has received considerable attention from theoreticians , and in many ways has been a paradigm for gravitational interactions in multiplanet extrasolar planetary systems . at first , research focused on its stability ( laughlin & adams 1999 ; rivera & lissauer 2000 ; lissauer & rivera 2001 ; laskar 2000 ; barnes & quinn 2001 ; godziewski 2001 ) .",
    "these investigations showed the system appeared to lie near the edge of instability , although an additional body could survive in between planets b and c ( rivera & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "later , attention turned to the apsidal motion ( stepinski 2000 ; chiang & murray 2002 ; malhotra 2002 ; ford 2005 ; barnes & greenberg 2006a , c , 2007a ) , with most investigators considering how the apsidal behavior provides clues to formation mechanisms such as planet - planet scattering or migration via disk torques .",
    "the recent direct measurement of the actual masses of planets c and d , and especially their 30@xmath4 mutual inclination , via astrometry ( mcarthur 2010 ) maintains this system s prominence among known exoplanetary systems . in this investigation , we evaluate planets c and d s gravitational interactions ( ignoring b as its orbit is still only constrained by radial velocity ( rv ) observations ) , as presented in mcarthur ( 2010 ) , which place strict constraints on the system s origin .",
    "such large mutual inclinations among planets are unknown in our solar system and hence indicate different processes occurred during or after the planet formation process .",
    "we assume c and d formed in coplanar , low eccentricity orbits in a standard planetary formation models ( see hubickyj 2010 ; mayer 2010 ) , but then additional phenomena , occurring late or after the formation process , altered the system s architecture .",
    "we consider two plausible mechanisms : a ) if the distant stellar companion b ( lowrance 2002 ) is on a significantly inclined ( relative to the initial orbital plane of the planets ) and/or eccentric orbit , it may pump up eccentricities and inclinations through `` kozai '' interactions ( kozai 1962 ; takeda 2007 ) ; or b ) if the planets form close together they may interact and scatter into mutually inclined orbits , as shown in previous studies ( weidenschilling & marzari 2002 ; chatterjee 2008 ; raymond 2010 )",
    ".    the mutual inclinations are obviously of the most interest , but other features of the system are also important .",
    "as represents the first exoplanetary system with full three - dimensional orbits and true masses directly measured ( aside from the pulsar system psr 1257 + 12 [ wolszczan 1994 ] ) , we may exploit this information when evaluating formation models . to that end",
    ", we develop a simple metric that quantifies the success of a model at reproducing numerous observed aspects of the @xmath0 and planetary system .",
    "although we apply this approach to @xmath0 and , it is generalizable to any planetary system .    in this investigation",
    "we limit the analysis to just c and d , and to the stable fit presented in mcarthur ( 2010 ) .",
    "as described in that paper , the inclination and longitude of ascending node of b are not detectable with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    ", so rather than explore the range of architecture permitted by rv data , we focus on the known properties of c and d. furthermore , we do not consider the range of uncertainties in c and d as the stable fit in mcarthur et al . (",
    "2010 ) is surrounded by unstable fits . as we see below , even limiting our scope in this way",
    ", we still must perform a large number of simulations over a wide range of parameter space .",
    "we first ( @xmath5 2 ) analyze the current orbital oscillations of c and d with an n - body simulation .",
    "we then use the dynamical properties to constrain our two inclination - raising scenarios , which we explore through @xmath650,000 n - body simulations .",
    "then in @xmath5 3 we show that b by itself can not raise the mutual inclinations to @xmath1 . in @xmath5 4",
    "we show that planet - planet scattering is a likely inclination - raising mechanism . however , we find that the most stringent constraint on scattering is the combination of its @xmath1 mutual inclination _ and _ extreme proximity to the stability boundary . in @xmath5 5",
    "we discuss the results and place them in context with previous dynamical and stability studies of exoplanets .",
    "table 1 : current configuration of c and d +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the orbital behavior of the model for ups and c and d proposed by mcarthur et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is quite different from that of orbital models identified by previous studies that had no knowledge of the inclination or actual mass of the planets .",
    "the major axes librate in an anti - aligned configuration , and their mutual inclination is substantial and oscillates with an amplitude of about @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the companion star b by itself can not pump the mutual inclination up to large values , even if the planets began with a significant relative inclination .",
    "however , it may have sculpted the planetary system by inciting an instability that ultimately led to ejections of formerly bound planets .",
    "the timescale to develop these instabilities is long .",
    "the configurations of b that could have such effects are sparsely distributed over parameter space , and the orbits of previously bound planets can not be specified .",
    "these factors make the role of b complicated , but suggest an in - depth analysis of its role merits further research .    even without b ,",
    "planet - planet scattering may have driven the system to the observed state . that process can easily reproduce the apsidal motion , but pumping the mutual inclination up to the observed values is difficult and probably requires the removal of a planet with mass @xmath8 m@xmath9 .",
    "removing two planets does not increase this probability significantly .",
    "the other important constraint on the scattering hypothesis is the system s close proximity to the stability boundary , @xmath10 .",
    "collisions may leave a system near that boundary , whereas ejections tend to spread out the planets . furthermore",
    ", we find that collisions tend to produce systems with low @xmath10 and low @xmath11 , while ejections produce a broad range of @xmath11 , but large values of @xmath10 . nonetheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] demonstrates that scattering can produce systems similar to @xmath0 and .",
    "although scattering is a reasonable process to produce the observed architecture , we can not determine the triggering mechanism .",
    "did scattering occur because b destabilized the planetary system ? or did the planet formation process itself , independent of b , ultimately lead to instabilities ?",
    "the presence of b makes distinguishing these possibilities very difficult .",
    "a larger census of mutual inclinations and stellar companions can resolve this open issue .",
    "alternatively , our decisions about the system at the onset of scattering could be mistaken .",
    "we assumed the planets formed inside the original protoplanetary disk with inclinations @xmath12 . it may be that larger initial inclinations are possible prior to scattering , in which case the planets could be pumped to larger mutual inclinations ( chatterjee 2008 ) .",
    "however , it remains to be seen if such configurations are possible prior to scattering .",
    "future studies should explore the inclinations of giant planets during formation .",
    "we have also ignored the effects of planet b , stellar companion b , and a possible fourth planetary companion ( mcarthur 2010 ) in our analysis .",
    "these bodies could significantly change the secular behavior , and/or the observed fundamental plane .",
    "furthermore , planet b is tidally interacting with its host star , which could alter the long - term secular behavior ( wu & goldreich 2002 ) .",
    "hence future revisions to this system , and the inclusion of tidal effects , could significantly alter the interpretations described above , possibly making scattering more likely to produce the observed system .",
    "we are currently exploring the wide range of @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s of b and the subsequent orbital evolution of the entire system .",
    "figure [ fig : single]i shows that scattering tends to produce two types of apsidal behavior : near - separatrix ( @xmath15 ) and motion far from the separatrix ( @xmath16 ) with a desert in between . adding a second scatterer to the mix",
    "does not erase this bimodality .",
    "this result contrasts with the case with no inclinations ( barnes & greenberg 2007a ) , in which near - separatrix motion ( @xmath17 ) is not a common outcome of scattering .",
    "[ fig : single]i shows that , in fact , both outcomes are likely , at least in systems similar to @xmath0 and .",
    "although there are hints of this structure in the observed exoplanet population ( barnes & greenberg 2006c ) , those results are based on radial velocity data .",
    "we now know that minimum masses are not necessarily a good indicator of apsidal motion .    for @xmath0 and ,",
    "the large mutual inclination and proximity to instability are strong constraints on the origin of its planetary system . however",
    ", for other systems , this may not be the case .",
    "we outlined in @xmath5 4 a method in which all aspects of a planetary system can be combined to quantify the validity of a formation model . when the mass and three dimensional orbits of a planetary system are known , the properties presented in table 1 can be combined into a single parameter @xmath18 which provides a statistic for quantitatively comparing models . in our analysis",
    "we ignored the observational errors , which is regrettable , but necessary due to the system s extreme proximity to dynamical instability ( mcarthur 2010 ) .",
    "we encourage future studies that strive to reproduce the system of mcarthur to find @xmath18 values less that those listed in table 3 , as lower values imply a closer match to the system , assuming that other stable solutions show similar behavior to the one we describe here .",
    "furthermore , investigations into exoplanet formation could compare distributions of observed and simulated properties as a quantitative method for model validation .",
    "the revisions of mcarthur ( 2010 ) reveal the importance of the mass - inclination degeneracy in dynamical studies of exoplanets . clearly in some cases",
    "masses can be much larger than the minimum value measured by radial velocity , which in turn changes secular frequencies and eccentricity amplitudes .",
    "however , large changes in mass due to the mass - inclination degeneracy should be rare , hence , trends using minimum masses may still be valid . nonetheless , we urge caution when exploring trends among dynamical properties ( zhou & sun 2003 ; barnes & greenberg 2006c ) , as they may be misleading .",
    "even if @xmath1 mutual inclinations turn out to be rare , systems with @xmath19 probably are not ( fig .  [",
    "fig : single ] ; chatterjee 2008 ; raymond 2010 ) .",
    "if these systems host planets with habitable climates , they may be very different worlds than earth .",
    "planetary inclinations can drive obliquity variations in terrestrial planets ( atobe 2004 , armstrong 2004 ; atobe & ida 2007 ) , unless they have a large moon ( laskar 1997 )",
    ". therefore future analyses of potentially habitable worlds should pay particular attention to the mutual inclinations , and climate modeling should explore the range of possibilities permitted by large mutual inclinations .",
    "terrestrial planets will likely be discovered in their star s habitable zone in the coming years .",
    "the orbital configuration and evolution of @xmath0 and warns us that habitability assessment hinge on the orbital architecture of the entire planetary system .",
