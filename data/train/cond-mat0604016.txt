    "manganites are characterized by a complex interplay of charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "undoped and weakly doped single layer manganites la@xmath3sr@xmath4mno@xmath2 show antiferromagnetic ( af ) order @xcite , in contrast to three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic la@xmath3sr@xmath5mno@xmath6 compounds @xcite , where ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath7 planes are stacked antiferromagnetically in the undoped case ( one electron per site , @xmath8 ) . as for their 3d counterparts , the properties of the layered systems are strongly influenced by the orbital degrees of freedom of @xmath0 electrons which couple to the spins and thus influence the magnetic order .    for @xmath8 , the hopping of @xmath0 electrons is blocked by large coulomb interaction @xmath9 , and charge fluctuations are quenched .",
    "they may be treated by second order perturbation theory which leads to virtual @xmath10 excitations by either @xmath0 or @xmath1 electrons , generating the spin - orbital superexchange @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we intend to focus on the role played by the orbital degrees of freedom of @xmath0 electrons in stabilizing various types of magnetic order in the undoped single layer manganites , and the changes of spin and orbital correlations with increasing temperature .",
    "we study an effective spin - orbital superexchange model derived for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain @xcite , generalized here to two - dimensional ( 2d ) planes of layered manganites .",
    "the model depends on spin configuration @xmath11 and takes the form , @xmath12 it consists of : ( @xmath13 ) the superexchange @xmath14 for the core spins formed by @xmath1 electrons , ( @xmath15 ) the orbital superexchange @xmath16 for the @xmath0 electrons , and ( @xmath17 ) a crystal field term @xmath18 . in the limit of large hund s exchange interaction",
    ", we restrict the @xmath0 electron configurations to the subspace with their spins parallel to the core spins at each site , and thus arrive at spinless fermions with an orbital flavor @xmath19 , standing for @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbitals , respectively .",
    "electrons with antiparallel spins are treated in second order perturbation theory in the same way as double occupancies .",
    "we start the discussion with the @xmath1 core spin superexchange term @xmath14 . in reality",
    "it depends on the total number of @xmath22 electrons occupying two interacting mn ions @xcite .",
    "however , in the undoped systems one finds @xmath23 configuration at each site and one may replace this part of the superexchange by a heisenberg hamiltonian with a properly chosen exchange constant @xmath24 favoring af order : @xmath25 for convenience we use classical core spins @xmath26 of unit length , and compensate their physical value @xmath27 by a proper increase of @xmath28 . for classical spins",
    "@xmath26 parameterized by polar angles @xmath29 , the spin product is given by @xmath30 , where the spin orientation enters via @xmath31 depending on the angle @xmath32 between the spins and on the phase @xmath33 , which cancels at @xmath8 .",
    "the superexchange term @xmath16 describes @xmath0 orbital interactions , as derived recently for a 1d chain @xcite from the full coupled spin - orbital dynamics by replacing the spin scalar products by the actual averages @xmath34 .",
    "the orbital superexchange @xmath16 depends then on spin correlations via the factors @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ uij ] ) , @xmath36 here , it is most convenient to use directional orbitals along the @xmath37 and @xmath38 axes , with @xmath39 .",
    "the density operators : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , are restricted to single occupancies , and @xmath43 also depend on the direction of the bond @xmath44 .",
    "the pseudospin @xmath45 orbital operators are given by @xmath46 finally , the superexchange constant @xmath47 is given by the high - spin excitation energy @xmath48 , see ref .",
    "the first term of eq.([hj ] ) favors fm spin and alternating orbital ( ao ) order , while the second one is optimized by af spin and ferro orbital ( fo ) order  both have similar strength and therefore closely compete .",
    "the last term of the hamiltonian is a crystal field splitting of @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath49 with the orbital splitting @xmath50 .",
    "we consider only @xmath51 with out - of - plane @xmath52 orbitals favored , which is suggested by the elongated octahedra in lasrmno@xmath2 along @xmath53 axis @xcite .    in order to treat this model",
    ", we employ a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm for the classical core spins ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) combined with exact diagonalization for the electron degrees of freedom @xcite . in this method , the many - particle hamiltonian for each spin configuration @xmath11 determined by @xmath35 is solved by exact diagonalization .",
    "the lowest states are then used to evaluate the trace over the fermionic degrees of freedom , @xmath54 , which gives the statistical weight for a given spin configuration @xmath11 , and which is sampled by the mcmc .",
    "autocorrelation analysis was used in order to verify that enough configurations were skipped between measurements .",
    "the boltzmann factors of the lanczos eigenstates are measured in order to ensure that only negligible weight is lost when the weight is calculated from the lowest eigenstates and we found that at most one or two percent are missed for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is inverse temperature .",
    "spin correlations @xmath57 for the undoped system along the @xmath58-direction are gradually weakened when temperature increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ss_0h ] ) . by increasing @xmath28 one identifies two distinctly different cases : for @xmath59 the system is fm at low temperature @xmath60 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ss_j0_0h ] ] , while af spin correlations arise for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , leading to zig - zag lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : ss_j0.02_0h ] and [ fig : ss_j0.05_0h ] .",
    "already a small value @xmath61 suffices to switch the spin order from fm to af , because fm and af terms strongly compete in eq .",
    "( [ hj ] ) .",
    "for the same reason , increasing temperature can easily destroy the magnetic order and both fm and af correlations decrease rapidly around @xmath63 , except for the stronger af superexchange @xmath62 , with more robust af correlations .",
    "next we investigate orbital correlations @xmath64 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_0h ] , which exhibit complementary behavior to the spin sector .",
    "here we selected @xmath65 operators which correspond to the expected ao order with @xmath66 orbital states in the 2d @xmath7 plane .",
    "one finds that the orbital correlations alternate for the fm spin order , while this alternation is suppressed for increasing @xmath28 , as almost only orbitals within the plane are then occupied ( fo order ) which promotes the af spin order . for @xmath59 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_j0_0h ] , one notes that the ao order remains robust with rising temperature although the spin correlations vanish , see fig .  [ fig : ss_j0_0h ] .",
    "remarkably , in the af case one observes the gradual development of ao order as the af spin correlations become weaker . for @xmath61",
    "this crossover happens at fairly low temperature @xmath67 , while it moves to higher temperature for @xmath68 .",
    "as the magnetic order is so closely related to the orbital order in @xmath7 planes , one expects that changing orbital occupation will modify the magnetic order .",
    "therefore , we investigated the electron density within the out - of - plane @xmath52 orbitals , @xmath69 . indeed , @xmath70 in the fm phase at low temperature ( @xmath59 ) , consistent with ao order , while fo order with @xmath71 orbitals ( @xmath72 ) takes over for the strongly af case ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "with rising temperature , @xmath52 orbitals are slightly depleted in the ferromagnet as orbital alternation becomes weaker . on the contrary , their occupation grows in the af case , when such alternation develops .",
    "this happens quite soon for @xmath73 , but takes much longer for @xmath68 , where af spin order also persists to higher temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig : oo_j0.05_0h ] .",
    "further , if one adds a crystal field splitting @xmath74 in the af phase with @xmath68 , this forces almost all electrons into the out - of - plane @xmath52 orbitals , the situation encountered in lasrmno@xmath2 . with rising temperature , however , electrons redistribute and in - plane @xmath71 orbitals gradually fill in , see fig .  [",
    "fig : n_beta ] , which was also observed in experiment @xcite .    the average af and fm terms in @xmath0 superexchange can be derived from ref .",
    "@xcite and are given by : @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "although @xmath77 becomes slightly smaller at higher temperature in the fm phase at @xmath59 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : n_se_beta](b ) ] , the changes are not very marked , because ao order persists .",
    "the fm coupling is therefore still almost the same as at low temperature , even if the magnetic order is lost because of thermal fluctuations . in the af systems ( @xmath61 , @xmath78 ) ,",
    "the fm terms are first quenched by fo order , but become more important with rising temperature while the af ones are reduced and , as before , this happens much sooner for @xmath61 than for @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , the af @xmath0 couplings are then changed into fm ones with rising temperature [ fig .",
    "[ fig : n_se_beta](c ) ] .    summarizing , at finite crystal field @xmath79 , as in lasrmno@xmath2",
    ", one observes that both @xmath77 and @xmath80 are weaker than for @xmath81 .",
    "the reason is that pairs of alternating orbitals are missing for fo order with @xmath52 orbitals in @xmath7 plane ( small @xmath77 ) , and the overlap between @xmath52 orbitals is much smaller than between @xmath71 orbitals ( small @xmath80 ) .",
    "therefore , the af order observed in lasrmno@xmath2 is promoted mainly by @xmath28 ."
