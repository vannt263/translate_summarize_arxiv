    "fluctuation theorems ( fts ) which describe properties of the distribution of various nonequilibrium quantities , such as work and entropy , have been developed over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "unlike most other relations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , remarkably , the fts are applicable to systems driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium .    in particular , consider a classical finite - sized system in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath0 and driven by some generalized force @xmath1 ( e.g. , volume , magnetic field ) . in equilibrium , the phase space distribution of the system is described by a well - defined statistical mechanical ensemble",
    ". the free energy @xmath2 can , in principle , be calculated and is a function of these parameters , i.e. @xmath3 . at some time @xmath4 ,",
    "say @xmath5 , @xmath1 is varied via a fixed path @xmath6 to a later time @xmath7 .",
    "if this process is carried out reversibly , the work done @xmath8 is simply the free energy difference @xmath9 .",
    "more generically , the process is irreversible and the second law gives the well - known inequality @xmath10    an ensemble of such processes would yield the work probability distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the finite width of @xmath11 is due to two stochastic sources : ( 1 ) the system configuration when the force is first initiated at @xmath5 is drawn from the equilibrium ensemble and ( 2 ) the path the system travels ( in phase space ) during the driving process is not deterministic due to the coupling with the heat bath .",
    "we study @xmath11 in the light of three closely related theorems described below , the jarzynski equality ( je )  @xcite , the transient fluctuation theorem ( tft )  @xcite , and crooks theorem ( ct )  @xcite .",
    "the powerful nonequilibrium work relation due to jarzynksi  @xcite allows one to exactly obtain equilibrium information ( the free energy difference ) from measurements of nonequilibrium processes .",
    "the je states @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inverse temperature ( with boltzmann s constant set to unity ) and the average is over the distribution function @xmath11 described above .",
    "the _ equality _ allows for the computation of @xmath14 even when the driving process is not adiabatic .",
    "this is to be compared with the _ inequality _ of eq.([eq : inequality ] ) .",
    "the je has been shown for hamiltonian systems  @xcite and markovian stochastic systems  @xcite .",
    "fluctuation theorems have been found for a wide class of systems and various nonequilibrium quantities , including work , heat , and entropy production .",
    "they are also generally divided into steady state  @xcite and transient theorems  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our discussion to the transient fluctuation theorem for the mechanical work done .",
    "the tft relates the ratio of probability distributions for the production of positive work to the production of negative work , @xmath15 similar to the je , the tft has been derived in driven deterministic systems  @xcite , and markovian stochastic systems  @xcite .",
    "crooks  @xcite connected the je and the tft by using a relation very similar to eq.([eq : tft ] ) , which we refer to as the crooks theorem , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability distribution for work done as described in the above scenario and @xmath18 is the probability distribution for negative work done in a time - reversed driving process .",
    "the similarity between eq.([eq : tft ] ) and eq.([eq : ct ] ) is evident and the two theorems are , in fact , equivalent for a large class of systems . however , under certain asymmetries in the potential and the driving force , differences between the tft and ct arise . in sec .",
    "iv , we show one such scenario .    unlike some other nonequilibrium quantities ( e.g. heat and entropy ) , the classical mechanical work is an easily defined quantity , @xmath19 .",
    "the original formulation of the je  @xcite , however , relies on the generalized work , @xmath20 . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these two differ by the boundary conditions @xmath21 and care must be taken in defining the work in the fluctuation theorems .    the ( space and time ) extensiveness of @xmath8 ( or @xmath22 ) demonstrates that second law `` violations '' become exponentially unlikely for thermodynamic systems ; these violations only become observably probable for microscopic systems . beyond purely theoretical interests ,",
    "the recent investigations of molecular motors and nano - mechanical devices demonstrate the practical importance for understanding these universal nonequilibrium theorems , especially under increasingly realistic scenarios .",
    "technological accessibility of microscopic systems has opened up experimental study and verification of the above theorems in various systems  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the je , tft , and ct for single harmonic and anharmonic oscillators .",
    "using second order langevin dynamics of a single oscillator , the work fluctuation theorems have been studied in ref .",
    "the work distribution function in harmonic polymer chains has been studied by one of us  @xcite .",
    "both these papers and the derivations of the fts for stochastic systems  @xcite utilize markovian dynamics . here , we study the fts for oscillators coupled to non - markovian baths .",
    "this extension is motivated by the intuition that there must be some memory to real heat baths and that all realistic models of heat baths , either classical  @xcite or quantum mechanical  @xcite , are non - markovian . through analytic expressions for the harmonic oscillator and numerical simulations of anharmonic oscillators , we demonstrate that the memory of the bath does not affect the validity of the fts .    in the next section , we briefly describe the model and the generalized langevin dynamics .",
    "iii contains explicit derivations of the",
    "je , tft , and ct in the harmonic limit where analytic calculations are possible . we show numerical results for the nonlinear oscillators in sec .",
    "iv and summarize our results in the last section .",
    "we model the system as a unit mass particle in a one - dimensional potential with dynamics governed by the generalized langevin equation  @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a conservative oscillator potential and@xmath25 is an externally determined time - dependent driving force .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms represent gaussian noise and damping , respectively , and must be related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the temperature of the bath . in the white gaussian noise limit",
    ", @xmath27 is proportional to a dirac @xmath29-function and the more familiar `` markovian '' langevin equation is recovered .",
    "we mention that the damping is even in time @xmath30 , an important property to be used in the next section .",
    "we use a potential @xmath24 of the form @xmath31 which can represent a truncation of the taylor expansion of some complicated potential .",
    "we restrict ourselves to bounded potentials .",
    "@xmath32 can represent the spatial position , an angular variable as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or a generalized coordinate . from this potential and the driving force",
    "@xmath25 conjugate to @xmath32 , the hamiltonian @xmath33 is clearly @xmath34 .",
    "if the force is time - independent , the system would eventually reach equilibrium and the free energy @xmath2 can be simply calculated by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the partition function . in this ensemble , we recall that the jarzynski work @xmath22 is not generally equal to the real mechanical work @xmath8  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the work distribution function for the harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "at low temperatures , many potentials can be well approximated by the harmonic potential .",
    "harmonic oscillators also have the practical virtue that a formal solution to eq.([eq : langevin ] ) exists .",
    "we use this formal solution to derive the distribution functions for the jarzynski generalized work @xmath22 and the real mechanical work @xmath8 .",
    "the work distribution functions are then used to verify the je and the tft .",
    "( the tft and ct are equivalent for the harmonic oscillator . )",
    "the analytic expressions in this section are analogous to the expressions from ref .",
    "@xcite with three main differences .",
    "the primary difference is that the noise is colored here .",
    "second , we use the full second order langevin equation instead of taking the strongly overdamped limit .",
    "the last difference is that we only study single harmonic oscillators instead of harmonic chains .",
    "our results should generalize to chains , which are more applicable to polymer stretching experiments  @xcite , though we do not discuss this generalization further .",
    "equilibrium quantities are easily evaluated for the harmonic oscillator . under constant",
    "driving , the free energy is @xmath38 since only the free energy difference @xmath14 appears in the je , only the first term on the right hand side is relevant . in this equilibrium ensemble , the averages for the initial position @xmath39 and velocity @xmath40 and their variances are @xmath41 where @xmath42 for any quantity @xmath43 .    the formal solution to eq.([eq : langevin ] ) for a harmonic potential is ( for @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 , \\label{eq : sol}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the homogeneous solutions with properties @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    ", we see that @xmath22 ( @xmath8 ) is proportional to @xmath32 ( @xmath54 ) and is , therefore , a linear combination of the stochastic terms .",
    "thus , in the harmonic limit , @xmath22 is gaussian distributed and it is sufficient to calculate the mean @xmath55 and variance @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , @xmath8 is gaussian as well and its distribution function is @xmath57 for such gaussian processes , the tft is satisfied if @xmath58 and the je is satisfied if @xmath59 .    in order to compare the means and variances of the work distributions , we first derive identities for the green s functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq.([eq : sol ] ) .",
    "the laplace transform of eq.([eq : langevin ] ) is @xmath60 + \\omega_o^2\\tilde{x}(s ) = 0 , \\label{eq : laplace}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the standard definition of the laplace transform .",
    "the green s functions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , must also satisfy equations analogous to eq.([eq : laplace ] ) and simplify due to their initial conditions .",
    "solving these algebraic expressions gives @xmath62 some manipulations and the inverse transform reveal identities between the two green s functions in laplace and real space , @xmath63 for white noise , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are well - known , we confirm that eqs.([eq : ids ] ) are correct .",

    "\\label{eq : varjar } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to simplify this expression to compare with eq.([eq : meanjar2 ] ) , we must reduce the quadruple integral to a more manageable double integral .",
    "we define @xmath71 the integrals of @xmath72 can be evaluated by first doing a double laplace transform , @xmath73 .",
    "this double transform can be done by using the even symmetry of @xmath27 .",
    "we separate and define the two symmetric parts of @xmath27 using the step function , @xmath74 incidentally , the laplace transforms of the two separate parts are equal to the laplace transform of @xmath27 , @xmath75 .",
    "we use this property , the convolution theorem , and eqs.([eq : ids ] ) to find the double transform , @xmath76 the inverse transform can easily be done , giving @xmath77 finally , we plug this expression back into eq.([eq : varjar ] ) , @xmath78 the last equality proves the jarzynski equality for harmonic oscillators , even when @xmath26 is not @xmath29-correlated . as in markovian stochastic derivations of the tft  @xcite ,",
    "the generalized work @xmath22 does _ not _ satisfy the tft , however @xmath79 does .    a simpler derivation of the je follows if we assume time - translation invariance of various correlation functions .",

    "we implement this symmetric driving and two asymmetric sawtooth forces with @xmath118 in our simulations . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there is a subtle difference in the tft and the ct with the latter using a time - reversed process in the denominator of the ratio of probabilities . for the symmetric sawtooth force ,",
    "forward and reverse driving must be equivalent and no differences exist between the tft and the ct .",
    "our asymmetric sawtooth forces are complementary in that the time - reverse driving of one force is equivalent to the time - forward driving of the other . in other words , in terms of this sawtooth force , the tft is @xmath119 whereas the ct is @xmath120 ( @xmath121 is the work distribution corresponding to a saw - tooth potential with a break at time @xmath122 . )     and @xmath123 .",
    "these distributions have positive means , but also substantial weight on the negative region of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath124 , indicating that the asymmetry in the driving force does not alter the work distribution functions , thus the ratios in the definition of the tft and the ct , eq.([eq : tftsaw ] ) and eq.([eq : ctsaw ] ) , must also be equal .",
    "the main figure confirms this equality and shows that the tft and the ct are valid for the quartic oscillator.,width=312 ]    we first simulate an anharmonic spring with a unit quartic anharmonicity ( i.e. @xmath125 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] displays the results of these simulations . aside from not being gaussian ,",
    "the probability distributions have similar properties as the work distribution of the harmonic oscillator : the means are all positive and there is a very substantial probability of measuring negative work .",
    "furthermore , the two complementary asymmetric driving forces give the same work probability functions .",
    "from eq.([eq : tftsaw ] ) and eq.([eq : ctsaw ] ) , it is clear that , in this case , the tft and the ct are equivalent . the main plot in fig .  [ fig : beta ] displays this equality as well as the validity of the theorems .     and @xmath123 .",
    "due to the lack of symmetry in the potential , @xmath126 .",

    "[ fig : beta ] and shows the probability distributions for the three different sawtooth driving forces . from this figure , it is clear that all three distributions are different and the ratio in the tft eq.([eq : tftsaw ] ) is not equivalent to the ratio in the ct eq.([eq : ctsaw ] ) .",
    "the difference between the tft and the ct is clearly shown by the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cube ] .",
    "in fact , the ct is valid under all sawtooth driving forces , whereas the tft is only valid in the symmetric driving force . for oscillator potentials that are not symmetric in @xmath32 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath128 , and the driving force is asymmetric in time about @xmath129 , the tft dramatically fails .    for our example",
    "the validity of the je follows from the ct .",
    "independently , we have also measured the average exponential of the work and find @xmath130 within @xmath131 decimal places for both symmetric and asymmetric oscillators . because @xmath110 , this indicates the jarzynski equality eq.([eq : je ] ) is most likely valid for a large class of oscillator potentials , even with exponentially correlated noise .",
    "when a sinusoidal force of the form @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is an odd integer , is used , the simulation results are qualitatively the same as with the symmetric sawtooth force .",
    "obviously , this is because the period of the sinusoidal force gives a symmetric ( about @xmath129 ) driving process .",
    "we also simulate linear driving which takes the system to a different equilibrium configuration in the adiabatic limit .",
    "though @xmath134 with linear driving , we find that the je and the ct are still valid , but the tft fails .",
    "this last result is not surprising because the linear driving force has many qualitative similarities with asymmetric sawtooth driving forces .",
    "the above results are unchanged when colored noise is replaced by white noise .",
    "the white noise results are to be expected due to the numerous analytical derivations of these nonequilibrium theorems  @xcite for markovian baths .",
    "our simulation results shown in this section indicate that the ct and the je are also valid for non - markovian baths .",
    "we have derived non - equilibrium work fluctuation theorems for the classical harmonic oscillator connected to a generalized langevin bath by studying the work distribution functions of the real mechanical work and the jarzynski generalized work .",

    "we also numerically measure the work distribution functions for anharmonic oscillators in langevin baths with exponentially correlated noise .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that the je extends to particles in a variety of oscillator potentials and driving forces .",
    "they also show that the symmetries of the potential and the driving force account for differences between the tft and the ct .",
    "crooks theorem is valid for all potentials and driving forces simulated , whereas the tft is not valid when the oscillator potential is not even in @xmath32 _ and _ the driving force is not symmetric in @xmath4 ( about @xmath129 ) .",
    "the strong agreement between our simulation results and the nonequilibrium theorems ( ct and je ) provides motivation for a derivation of the theorems for anharmonic oscillators in non - markovian baths .",
    "these results are important due to the existence of noise correlations in any real heat bath .",
    "this has obvious consequences for experimental tests of the jarzynski equality and the fluctuation theorems .",
    "experimentally , the je is a powerful tool to measure equilibrium free energy differences due to the fact that any real driving is done irreversibly .",
