    "it is clear from the annals of stellar astrophysics that low - mass stars undergo mixing as they ascend the red giant branch ( rgb hereafter , for example see ) .",
    "this is contrary to canonical models of red giants that incorporate convection as the only form of internal mass transport .",
    "such models predict just one event capable of changing surface abundances of light elements on the first ascent of the red giant branch , namely the so - called first dredge up ( fdu e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a variety of observations indicate that some form of non - convective mixing ( which is often termed  extra mixing \" in the literature ) progressively transports cn - processed material to the surface along the upper rgb whilst reducing the @xmath0 abundance .",
    "the effects of extra mixing are observed in field stars and globular cluster ( gc ) stars with increasing efficiency seen at lower metallicities .",
    "the mixing occurs internally as the star ascends the giant branch therefore variations in abundance manifest themselves as a function of luminosity .",
    "this is most clearly seen in carbon @xcite and lithium .    during the rgb phase of evolution the star possesses a degenerate hydrogen - exhausted core .",
    "a thin hydrogen - burning shell progresses outwards through the star contributing processed material to the inert core . a convective envelope which transports material to the stellar surface",
    "is separated from the shell by a radiative region .",
    "extra mixing requires some mechanism to transport material across this radiative zone to the top of the hydrogen shell where it encounters temperatures where burning can occur .",
    "processed material is cycled back to the convective envelope accounting for the observed compositions . identifying the exact physics that induces this mixing",
    "has been debated at length ; it has proven to be a challenging task for stellar astrophysics .",
    "phenomenological models of extra mixing can match the general abundance trends associated with further dredge up of cn processed material @xcite .",
    "many physically based mechanisms have also been explored as potential candidates : rotational mixing , magnetic fields @xcite , internal gravity waves @xcite and more recently thermohaline mixing and the combination of thermohaline mixing and magnetic fields @xcite . like any new paradigm thermohaline mixing has stimulated a wealth of subsequent work ( see ) .",
    "the mechanism is initially driven by instabilities brought about from local inversions in the mean molecular weight .",
    "these inversions arise through the burning of @xmath1 .",
    "the reaction @xmath2 produces more particles than it consumes . if this reaction can occur in a homogenized region , such as is the case when the hydrogen burning shell advances through the composition discontinuity left by first dredge - up ( fdu ) , then its effect on the molecular weight profile can dominate ( for a detailed explanation of the mixing process see @xcite ) . understanding and modelling",
    "this mechanism is an area of active research at present .",
    "have shown that the mechanism can match the rgb abundances of field stars , with a dependence on metallicty which was also demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the next logical step was to test the mechanism against abundance measurements in globular clusters as @xcite did with stars in m3 .",
    "m3 was chosen as a test case because it is considered a typical globular cluster .",
    "a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xcite means that it falls near the mode in the metallicity distribution of halo globular clusters .",
    "it is well studied and exhibits significant [ c / fe ] depletion @xcite as well as reduction in @xmath0/@xmath4 @xcite along the rgb . here",
    "we extend this work and compare m3 to its second parameter partner m13 thus testing the mechanism in another cluster of similar metallicity .",
    "we also turn to the more extreme end of the gc metallicity distribution by investigating the clusters m92 , m15 and ngc 5466 ( all with [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) .",
    "this sample allows us to investigate the mechanism in multiple clusters at a range of metallicites .",
    "the exercise is somewhat complicated by the fact that globular clusters possess multiple stellar populations .",
    "historically globular clusters ( gcs ) have been utilized as test - beds for stellar theory .",
    "some of the earliest published studies of gcs @xcite coincided with the first stellar evolution calculations @xcite .",
    "the initial mass spread of the stars and their presumed coeval nature contributed to the color magnitude diagram s usefulness as a diagnostic tool for the developing theory @xcite . during this time gcs",
    "were considered to be simple stellar populations ; that is , the stars in any given cluster were assumed to be of the same age and composition .",
    "hence the cluster color magnitude diagram was an outcome of variations in stellar mass .",
    "the first study to challenge the simple stellar population hypothesis was that of @xcite .",
    "he measured cn band strength in the stars of m3 and m13 and found a cn - strong star amongst many cn - weak .",
    "the importance of popper s find was highlighted by @xcite who found cn - strong stars in m5 and m10 .",
    "these were the first clues that gcs possess heterogeneous c and n abundances .",
    "the heterogeneity of stars within gcs extends beyond carbon and nitrogen . along the rgb , as well as on the main sequence , o , na ,",
    "mg , and al can display star - to - star variations ( e.g. , and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is now commonly argued that a previous generation of stars polluted the medium from which a distinct second population formed .",
    "the first generation imprinted the abundance patterns from the various stellar burning sites , whether they were asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite , super asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite , massive binaries or massive rotating stars .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the presence of c - n - o - na abundance dispersions on the main sequences of gcs .",
    "the formation of a second generation of stars from gas that is rich in cn - processed material provides a paradigm that explains the observations of dichotomous cn band strengths in gc stars .",
    "the cn band strength is a useful indicator of nitrogen content of globular cluster rgb star atmospheres .",
    "new stars that form from the polluted gas are inherently enriched in nitrogen as well as @xmath6 compared to the primordial generation @xcite . the fact that the dichotomy in the cn band strength has been detected below the bump in the luminosity function ( lf bump ) , albeit for clusters that are of intermediate to high metallicity , provides strong evidence for the pollution scenario .    the cn bands can be used as population tracers in all but the most metal - poor clusters where [ fe / h ] @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , since the cn bands are weak at low metallicity @xcite . in such cases",
    "the existence of multiple populations can be inferred through other means . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that in metal poor clusters [ na / fe ] varies by over 1 dex and this variation is not correlated with rgb evolution .",
    "the temperatures required for processing of na are beyond those reached by thermohaline mixing on the rgb .",
    "we therefore expect a normal ( primordial ) and enriched population given the large spread .",
    "this is a strong indication that multiple populations do exist in these clusters .",
    "evidence of this multiple population scenario is not limited to the observations of cn band strength or variations in [ na / fe ] .",
    "it is discussed at length by @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see references therein ) for the main sequence ( ms ) and sub giant branch .",
    "techniques such as isochrone fitting require distinct @xmath6 abundances in these populations to explain color magnitude diagrams .",
    "examples of such clusters include : omega centauri @xcite , ngc 2808 @xcite and 47 tucanae @xcite .",
    "we note also that calculations by @xcite show the horizontal branches of various clusters can be best reproduced with the presence of two populations , one of which has elevated @xmath6 abundances , which is a prediction of the pollution scenario .",
    "the prevailing picture is that in order to match observations , pollution from a primordial generation must be present in the cluster to provide an enriched environment from which a second population forms . furthermore extra",
    "mixing must be operating in each generation as they ascend the rgb .",
    "this is exactly what @xcite suggested is happening in m3 .",
    "@xcite provided further evidence for this hypothesis and inferred that the cluster is comprised of two populations with different ages and abundances .",
    "it was found that thermohaline mixing can account for the variation in carbon abundance of both the cn - weak and cn - strong stars but only for the nitrogen abundance of the cn - weak stars .",
    "the cn - strong stars have so much nitrogen to begin with that any extra mixing does not significantly affect the surface composition .",
    "furthermore the spread in [ n / fe ] is dominated by the variation that was present among the cluster stars before they commenced rgb evolution .    in this work we examine the hybrid picture for the chemical evolution of gc giants across a range of metallicity .",
    "we investigate the variation of surface [ c / fe ] with magnitude on the giant branch of various clusters .",
    "the initial abundances are chosen to match the observed subgiant values .",
    "we concentrate on c and n because only for these species do data exist over a wide range of luminosity for clusters of different metallicity ( data for li as a function of magnitude exists for m4 and ngc 6397 , but the lithium values saturate over a range @xmath8 magnitude whereas the [ c / fe ] show variation over @xmath9 magnitudes , see @xcite and",
    ". also measurements of lithium above the lf bump are scarce and many are upper limits rather than detections . ) . in the intermediate - metallicity clusters we compare m3 to m13 .",
    "we also turn to the metal poor regime where @xcite alluded to significant problems with the contribution of extra mixing in m92 ; namely the stars appear to begin mixing before they reach the lf bump . here",
    "we examine a further two similarly metal - poor clusters in m15 and ngc 5466 in order to help identify whether the behavior is due to a unique mixing history in m92 or is common amongst metal - poor systems .",
    "we use monstar ( the monash version of the mt .",
    "stromlo evolution code ; see ) to produce stellar models for the clusters .",
    "our implementation of thermohaline mixing follows that of @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite and in that we use the formulation developed by @xcite and , where thermohaline mixing is modelled as a diffusive process with coefficient :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , _ k _ is the thermal diffusivity and @xmath16 is a dimensionless free parameter .",
    "in fact @xmath16 is related to the aspect ratio , @xmath17 , of the thermohaline fingers ( assumed to be cylindrical ) by :    @xmath18    following @xcite , we employ the empirically derived value of _ _",
    "c@xmath19__@xmath20 for the stars in gcs .",
    "it should be noted that and @xcite prefer a lower value of _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath21 .",
    "their choice of parameter is based on theoretical grounds and matches the choice of .",
    "numerical simulations from @xcite and @xcite also indicate that a value of _ _",
    "c@xmath19__@xmath21 should be adopted .",
    "this value is unable to reproduce observations but must serve as a caveat to the approach taken in this work .",
    "we return to this point in section [ rolethm ] .",
    "@xcite showed that the chemical evolution of the stars in m3 is consistent with the hybrid theory of globular cluster evolution . in intermediate metallicity clusters the contribution of primordial enrichment can be traced through measurements of the cn bands and these were used in m3 to infer the distinct populations .",
    "furthermore in each population the evolution of [ c / fe ] along the rgb was well modelled by thermohaline mixing .",
    "it is important to test whether this result pertains to other clusters of similar metallicity . as such we turn our attention to m13 .",
    "m3 and m13 are a second parameter pair of metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath22 and ages between 11.3 and 14.2 gyr .",
    "similarities between the two clusters exist in age , metallicity , na - o anticorrelation @xcite , na spread @xcite and r - process variation @xcite ; it is only horizontal branch morphology that differs significantly .",
    "we therefore expect thermohaline mixing operating in multiple populations to also model the variation of [ c / fe ] ( and [ n / fe ] ) in m13 .",
    "we use data for m3 and m13 from a variety of sources .",
    "the m3 data are taken from @xcite which is compiled from previous studies in the literature , namely @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with a zero point offset applied in order to homogenize the data .",
    "in addition to determining carbon and nitrogen abundances as a function of absolute magnitude , @xcite and @xcite measured the cn strength for m3 giants .",
    "we do not possess measurements of cn strength for the stars in the m13 sample but ( unlike m3 ) observations of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] exist on the main sequence .",
    "for m13 we incorporate the studies of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "offsets to allow for systematic differences have been applied by @xcite for all but the most recent study .",
    "we assumed a distance modulus of @xmath23 which is an average of various measurements ( @xmath24 from @xcite , @xmath25 from @xcite , @xmath26 from @xcite , @xmath27 from @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty introduced here is no larger than the measurement error of the observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m3m13 ] we plot the determined [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] values against absolute visual magnitude for m13 and m3 .",
    "symbols are used to specify to which study the data corresponds ; the legend can be found in the figure .",
    "we include two calculations ( the two solid curves ) used to model m3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the models are of mass @xmath28 and metallicity @xmath29 . in these calculations",
    "we run without convective overshoot , our mixing length parameter @xmath17 is set to 1.75 and thermohaline mixing parameter _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath20 . in both clusters",
    "the solid black curve represents our cn - weak model with initial abundances @xmath30 , @xmath3110@xmath32 , @xmath3310@xmath32 and @xmath3410@xmath35 . the initial carbon and nitrogen values were selected to match the measurements of these species in the cn - weak stars in m3 .",
    "the solid grey curve corresponds to our cn - strong model with @xmath3610@xmath32 , @xmath3710@xmath32 and @xmath3810@xmath35 to match the cn - strong population in m3 . as the stars are likely to have undergone cn cycling we increased our @xmath6 to @xmath39 which only has a marginal effect on the location of the lf bump .",
    "thermohaline mixing operating in two populations models the behavior of [ c / fe ] along the rgb in both m3 and m13 . in the case of m13",
    "we have the added constraint of observations along the main - sequence . in this cluster the cn strong model acts as a lower envelope to the rgb observations and simultaneously accounts for most of the main - sequence data .",
    "however , there are a number of sub - giant and main - sequence stars at lower [ c / fe ] than seen in the m3 data . in order to match the entire main - sequence spread we have taken our cn strong model and reduced the initial carbon by a further 0.4 dex .",
    "this is our dotted blue curve where we set initial abundances to @xmath4010@xmath41 , @xmath4210@xmath32 and @xmath4310@xmath35 . by design this model matches the most carbon depleted subgiants ( except for the three extreme cases with [ c / fe ] @xmath44 ) but the predicted abundances along the rgb",
    "are systematically lower than the current observations .",
    "it appears as if these most - carbon - depleted subgiants lack counterparts on the rgb .",
    "this could be the role of small statistics or the effect of systematic offsets from different data sources ; recall we do not apply an offset for the @xcite study .",
    "we are unable to account for the two most carbon - poor stars in m13 ( [ c / fe ] @xmath45 ) .",
    "these stars are at the faint end of the @xcite catalogue and hence have large associated errors ( cohen 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "compared to m3 , there appears to be a larger star - to - star variation in nitrogen in m13 ; a significantly n - enhanced model is required to reproduce the upper envelope of the data . in the context of the current paradigm",
    "the enrichment is proposed to be due to on cycling in the polluting generation of stars . to investigate this we constructed an on - cycled model ( dashed green line ) with half the oxygen converted to n , giving @xmath3610@xmath32 , @xmath4610@xmath35 and @xmath4710@xmath35 .",
    "the figure shows that the change in [ n / fe ] produced by thermohaline mixing is negligible .",
    "the initial nitrogen in these stars is sufficiently high that any nitrogen brought to the surface via thermohaline mixing makes little difference to the envelope composition .",
    "we note from figure [ fig : m3m13 ] that even the on cycled model ( green dashed line ) fails to account for the n - rich stars which show 1 dex more n than this model . even processing all the o into n would not produce a sufficiently high n abundance .",
    "we must consider the possibility , therefore that c+n+o is higher in m13 than in m3 .",
    "this is a testable prediction .",
    "as we have stated there are a larger number of stars in m13 that are enriched in nitrogen ; @xcite find the cluster contains four times as many cn - strong stars than cn - weak ones . in terms of the hybrid theory",
    "this is interpreted as the cluster containing a majority of second generation stars . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the observations suggest that the m3 stars are evenly split amongst the cn - weak and cn - strong populations . the inferred ratios of the stellar populations within the clusters , determined from measurements of the cn bands agree with the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "they have independently determined that more than 70% of stars in m13 and 50% in m3 are required to be enriched in @xmath6 ( a product of cn cycling along with n enrichment ) to reproduce the respective horizontal branch morphologies .    in m3",
    "there is a distinct lack of cn - strong stars at low luminosity .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this is an artifact of the original @xcite study in which the lower luminosity stars that were observed happened to be cn - weak .",
    "@xcite showed that cn - strong giants do exist in m3 at luminosities corresponding to the faint limit of the @xcite survey , as did @xcite .",
    "the latter show the cn band strength remains clearly dichotomous in m3 even at low luminosity .",
    "we assume this will be reflected in the [ n / fe ] abundances and therefore [ c / fe ] .",
    "so whilst we possess measurements of the cn bands for our m3 sample and a few observations of [ c / fe ] at low luminosity , conversely in m13 we possess many low - luminosity observations of [ c / fe ] but no measurements of the cn bands .",
    "once again the work of @xcite provides some insight .",
    "they demonstrate an obvious dichotomy in the cn bands along the rgb of m13 .",
    "the dichotomy is not as clear below the sub giant branch as the temperatures are too high to allow molecule formation .",
    "@xcite also show a greater spread in the cn band values especially in the cn strong stars ; this is reflected in the large spread in [ n / fe ] observed in the cluster .",
    "carbon depletion along the rgb of ngc 5466 has been observed by , @xcite and @xcite . in this study",
    "we use the data from @xcite as the observations are from a single instrument , they cover a large luminosity range and for each star [ c / fe ] and the cn band strength were determined . as was the case for the intermediate - metallicity clusters , we plot [ c / fe ] as a function of absolute visual magnitude . in figures [ fig : m92]a and [ fig : m92]b the ngc 5466 data are plotted according to cn band strength ; open circles denote cn - weak stars , filled circles denote cn - strong stars whilst triangles represent stars where the cn band strength is unknown . the black solid curve in figure [ fig :",
    "m92]a is our thermohaline mixing model with initial abundances of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the model is of mass @xmath28 and metallicity @xmath52 corresponding to the observed [ fe / h]@xmath53 and age between 11 and 16 gyr @xcite .",
    "we run without convective overshoot , set the mixing length parameter to @xmath54 and set the thermohaline mixing parameter to _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath20 .",
    "highlighted also are the locations of the important mixing events along the rgb .",
    "common to all panels are the solid vertical line and dotted line .",
    "the solid vertical line represents the end of first dredge - up as calculated in the models ; this occurs at @xmath55 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the lf bump at [ fe / h]@xmath56 according to @xcite based on a metallicity - lf bump relation ; this occurs at @xmath57 . for each individual cluster",
    "we also include the dashed line which represents a photometrically derived value of the lf bump magnitude . in ngc 5466",
    "this was determined by @xcite and occurs at @xmath58 .",
    "the end of first dredge - up marks the end of any surface composition changes expected by canonical theory . for stars of this mass and metallicity",
    "there is no visible change to the envelope composition from first dredge - up : the change in surface mass - fraction of carbon is @xmath59 in our models .",
    "the position of the lf bump represents the earliest point at which thermohaline mixing can begin to operate .",
    "it corresponds to the point when the hydrogen burning shell meets the composition discontinuity left behind by first dredge - up .",
    "figure [ fig : m92]a suggests that our solar scaled model ( black curve ) is a good fit to observations of [ c / fe ] in ngc 5466 .",
    "surface depletion in the cluster appears to begin after the lf bumps determined by and @xcite .",
    "we find that the bump determined by @xcite is a more convincing fit to the models than that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also inferred the lf bump magnitude by isochrone fitting and obtained a value 0.3 magnitudes brighter agreeing with the @xcite prediction .",
    "the determination of the lf bump at low metallicity is difficult .",
    "we return to this point in section [ compz ]    although a single cn population undergoing thermohaline mixing is a satisfactory fit to the data , in figure [ fig : m92]b we provide an equally plausible fit drawn by eye .",
    "the black solid line ( which applies to figures [ fig : m92]b , [ fig : m92]d & [ fig : m92]f ) tries to take into account our belief that carbon depletion should not occur until after first dredge - up but does not take into consideration any preconceptions of the mixing profile . if we assume the bump luminosity calculated by @xcite is correct then depletion begins after the lf bump , as expected .",
    "if , however , we use the bump luminosity calculated by @xcite then the mixing may be argued to begin before the bump is reached .",
    "ngc 5466 requires almost no spread in the initial composition to account for the spread of carbon .",
    "in addition to measurements of [ c / fe ] , @xcite analyzed the cn bands of the stars in their sample .",
    "the results hinted that a cn dichotomy , which is typical in globular cluster red giants , may be present but as we can see from figure [ fig : m92]a the stars do not separate as clearly as those in the more metal rich clusters .",
    "@xcite used a linear least - squares fit in the plane of the s(3839 ) cn index @xcite versus absolute v magnitude to divide relatively cn - strong stars ( those above the line ) from cn - weak stars ( those below the line ) .",
    "as in other studies of low - metallicity globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the mean separation in cn band strength between the two groups is not large relative to the scatter within each group .",
    "whilst the data suggest that there is a cn bimodality in ngc 5466 , its low metallicity reduces the effectiveness of cn band strength as a marker of multiple populations in this cluster .      the m92 data in figures [ fig : m92]c and [ fig : m92]d are those adopted by @xcite and comprise data from various sources to which offsets have been applied in order to remove systematic differences in abundance scales .",
    "these original sources are studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and we highlight the target stars in each catalogue ( see the legend in the figure ) . even with typical errors of @xmath60 dex there is a much larger spread in [ c / fe ] at any given magnitude than was seen in ngc 5466 . in these m92 panels",
    "the dotted line is the photometrically derived lf bump identified by @xcite .",
    "these authors have undertaken high resolution hst observations to determine the lf bump in many globular clusters .",
    "their measured value of the magnitude of the bump @xmath61 .",
    "( @xmath62 ) differs from the older value of @xmath63 .",
    "we do not possess measurements of cn band strength for the m92 stars plotted in figures [ fig : m92]c and [ fig : m92]d but @xcite and @xcite have provided evidence that a bimodality may exist . as is the case for ngc 5466",
    "the separation in the populations is marginal , a property that appears common at low metallicity . even without the cn bands the spread in [ na / fe ] @xcite , and the spread in [ c / fe ] at low luminosities is evidence for mixing between the two populations .",
    "the depletion of [ c / fe ] in m92 has previously been investigated by @xcite but over a smaller luminosity range . their ( canonical ) extra mixing formulation requires two models , one depleted by 0.1 dex and the other by 0.5 dex in [ c / fe ] to match the abundance spread .",
    "@xcite considered the depletion of [ c / fe ] with a different implementation of thermohaline mixing to that used here .",
    "they highlighted that m92 appeared to show surface depletion of carbon before fdu , a property in disagreement with not just thermohaline mixing but also canonical stellar theory .",
    "this strange behavior has been discussed by ( at least ) @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this apparent pre - fdu depletion is highlighted in figure [ fig : m92]d . here",
    "the black solid line is an eye fit based on the assumption that carbon depletion should not occur until after fdu while the grey curve is a best fit by eye to the data without any preconceived luminosity for the onset of carbon depletion .",
    "if we follow the latter fit , then by the time the end of fdu is reached the stars have depleted almost 0.5 dex in [ c / fe ] .",
    "this is unusual because , as we have stated , at this mass and metallicity we expect changes due to fdu to be of the order @xmath64(c ) @xmath65 . between the end of first dredge - up ( @xmath66 @xmath67 ) and the determined location of the lf",
    "bump according to @xcite ( @xmath66 @xmath68 ; the earliest point at which thermohaline mixing is expected to begin ) the stars in m92 are depleted by roughly a further 0.3 dex in [ c / fe ] .",
    "depletion is present but not as pronounced if the @xcite bump magnitude is used .",
    "it is possible that these are the observable effects of other extra - mixing mechanisms and this may also explain the carbon depletion prior to the end of first dredge - up .",
    "if true , this would have significant implications for stellar theory .",
    "first of all such depletion was not seen in other clusters @xcite . in most scenarios ,",
    "extra mixing is inhibited until the star reaches the lf bump and the advancing h - shell removes the molecular weight discontinuity left behind by the receding convective envelope . in the case of",
    "m92 some stars on the giant branch have already depleted their [ c / fe ] by about 0.8 dex when the models reach this stage .",
    "if we have to postulate that some form of mixing begins sufficiently early to produce this depletion , then the mixing must necessarily remove the abundance discontinuity that is itself responsible for the lf bump .",
    "if the apparent behavior is real , we believe this is a significant problem for stellar astrophysics .",
    "if we assume that m92 displays an initial spread of [ c / fe]=0.5 dex then can we remove the issue of mixing before the end of fdu ?",
    "the black curve in figure [ fig : m92]c is the same solar scaled model applied to match the stars in ngc 5466 . as we now require a greater spread in carbon to match this cluster we include a second model ( grey solid curve )",
    "run with the same physical parameters but a composition that is reduced in c and enhanced in n. for this model we set @xmath48 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 giving [ c / fe]=-0.5 .",
    "we have not changed y in the model .",
    "the main effect of changing y is to alter the the location of the lf bump and as we have seen in m3 and m13 this is negligible .",
    "these two thermohaline models with large initial carbon spread remove the apparent pre fdu depletion .",
    "assuming such a spread in [ c / fe ] raises the issue that there are no stars observed with [ c / fe]=-0.5 below a magnitude of @xmath72 .",
    "only four stars have been observed at such magnitudes and all have [ c / fe ] @xmath73 .",
    "a large spread in [ c / fe ] is observed in m15 and m13 below the sub giant branch .",
    "we expect this is the case in m92 but require a targeted study to confirm this assumption .",
    "a large spread in [ c / fe ] does not solve all the problems associated with m92 .",
    "mixing still appears to be occurring before the lf bump , even for the model with an initial [ c / fe]=-0.5 .",
    "there is approximately 1 magnitude between the location where the carbon abundances turn down and where the models suggest depletion should begin . of greater concern",
    "is the inability of the models to match the upper rgb abundances of stars in m92 .",

    "no stars that have depleted [ c / fe ] ( magnitude brighter than @xmath74 ) fall along the evolutionary path predicted by the solar scaled model ( black curve ) .",
    "if such stars do exist and are governed by thermohaline mixing , we expect them to be bright members in the cluster ( ascending the rgb ) . it would be perverse if by chance they were not selected for any of the three high resolution spectrographic studies ( unless of course , they are all in the centre of the cluster ) .",
    "the initially depleted model ( grey curve ) provides an upper envelope to the mixed rgb data , however the composition was selected to form a lower limit of the initial m92 abundance spread .",
    "it is sobering to see how many data points fall below this curve .",
    "although the two models with an initial spread of 0.5 dex in [ c / fe ] can encompass fainter stars ( @xmath75 there are very few stars between the curves once carbon depletion has begun .",
    "thermohaline does not deplete carbon to the levels seen in m92 : the models are unable to simultaneously account for both the sub - giant branch and rgb data .",
    "the m92 sample is a combination of three different studies and although attempts have been made to homogenize the data , systematic differences in the studies still may lead to offsets of @xmath76 dex in the [ c / fe ] abundances . at such low metallicity one has to wonder if inhomogeneity in the data may be affecting our interpretation of the mixing history .",
    "extensive measurements of [ c / fe ] at various magnitudes in this cluster would provide a robust test for stellar evolution models .",
    "[ c / fe ] as a function of magnitude is plotted for m15 in figures [ fig : m92]e and [ fig : m92]f .",
    "the data are a combination of those from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crosses ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* diamonds ) and plotted as given in these sources .",
    "no offsets have been applied to correct for systematic errors so the data are marked according to their source . as is the case with m92 we do not possess cn band strength measurements for our sample but @xcite show there would be little separation between the mean values of the cn - strong and cn - weak stars , a common aspect of the three metal poor clusters studied here .",
    "the same is also true for ( at least ) ngc 5053 a cluster with metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath77 @xcite . in figures [ fig : m92]e and [ fig : m92]f the dotted vertical line represents the magnitude of the m15 lf bump determined by @xcite which occurs at @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this is in comparison to @xcite who also used hst data to determine a bump magnitude of @xmath80 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m92]e we plot the two thermohaline mixing models applied in m92 . in both clusters",
    "thermohaline mixing does not deplete carbon to the degree seen in the observations .",
    "like m92 there is evidence that m15 is mixing between the end of fdu and the lf bump .",
    "this is highlighted by figure [ fig : m92]f where we plot our lines drawn by eye rather than the stellar models .",
    "this effect would be exacerbated had we adopted the location of the lf bump according to @xcite .",
    "it is possible this is an artefact of combining inhomogeneous data .",
    "there is some luminosity overlap between the two studies and it is only when they are combined that it appears as if pre bump depletion is occurring .",
    "this same argument can be used to explain any pre - fdu mixing alluded to by the grey line of best fit in figure [ fig : m92]c .",
    "a homogeneous set of observations over this luminosity range ( as exists for ngc 5466 ) is required .",
    "while similarities exist there are also slight differences between m15 and m92 .",
    "a large spread of [ c / fe ] is present in m15 , which extends below the sub giant branch .",
    "this is justification for the inclusion of our initial [ c / fe ] @xmath81 model ( grey curve in figures [ fig : m92]c and [ fig : m92]e ) . in m92",
    "it is the dearth of observations at low luminosity that raises many questions about the behavior of the cluster and its initial abundance spread .",
    "we note there seems to be a lack of stars with high [ c / fe ] just before fdu in m15 .",
    "we assume these stars exist and the current void is a result of combining two studies that focus on stars at different stages of evolution .",
    "perhaps the most curious aspect of m15 is the behavior of the stars at @xmath82 .",
    "the stars appear to suddenly increase their carbon abundance .",
    "we await confirmation of this behavior before speculating on its cause as it is inconsistent with our current understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis .    and @xcite use lithium to trace extra mixing along the giant branches of ngc 6397 and m4 respectively .",
    "such studies provide a complimentary diagnostic to the variation of c and n with luminosity .",
    "lithium is very sensitive to nuclear burning : it is destroyed at low temperatures .",
    "any transport of material into warmer regions will be reflected through a depletion in the surface lithium abundance . in the case of m15 and m92",
    "this would hopefully help identify the magnitude at which extra mixing begins in these clusters .",
    "given the behavior of m15 and m92 the point at which surface depletion begins ( after first dredge - up ) must be considered distinct from the lf bump ( even though there are good theoretical reasons why the two should coincide as they seem to at higher metallicity ) . for our purposes we can only rely on high level photometry ( and statistical analysis ) of the clusters to distinguish the location of the bump and , as we discuss in section [ compz ] , this can be difficult .",
    "in our two intermediate - metallicity clusters the spread in [ c / fe ] is explained by distinct populations which clearly separate according to cn band strength .",
    "this is not the case in low - metallicity clusters @xcite .",
    "any cn bimodality is marginal at best .",
    "the difference between the mean value of a cn index such as s(3839 ) between cn - strong and cn - weak stars is so small that their distribution can be interpreted as a single cn population with scatter .",
    "there is still clear evidence for multiple populations in the metal poor clusters from the large spreads in o , na , al abundance within them .",
    "we therefore expect that a polluting generation will enrich the cluster with cn processed material and @xmath6 .",
    "this should be reflected in the carbon and nitrogen abundances . in m15",
    "there is a large spread in both [ c / fe ] ( @xmath83 1.5 dex ) and [ n / fe ] ( @xmath83 3 dex , * ? ? ? * ) but only a marginal change in the cn bands @xcite . in these low metallicity clusters",
    "the cn band strength is not necessarily representative of the nitrogen abundance in the stars .    according to our stellar models with thermohaline mixing ,",
    "the clusters studied here are close enough in metallicity that we should expect a similar degree of carbon depletion . in the intermediate metallicity clusters ( m3 and m13 ) , we are able to match the depletion of [ c / fe ] along the rgb using two models of different initial abundances . in the metal poor systems thermohaline",
    "mixing can account only for the evolution of [ c / fe ] in ngc 5466 . in m15 and m92 not only",
    "do the clusters appear to have depleted far more carbon than we predict but this depletion has begun before the lf bump .",
    "such behavior is not only inconsistent with thermohaline mixing but also standard stellar evolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the lf bump in extremely metal - poor clusters ( e.g. , m92 , m15 and ngc 5466 ) is not as clearly visible as it is in more metal - rich clusters .",
    "there are two theoretical reasons why this is so .",
    "firstly the depth of first dredge - up is a function of metallicity .",
    "metal - rich stars have deeper convective envelopes than metal poor stars and therefore a greater discontinuity in the hydrogen profile that develops after first dredge - up .",
    "the burning shell in metal - poor stars will encounter a smaller hydrogen difference and spend less time readjusting the stellar structure . because less time is spent at the magnitude of the bump the likelihood of observing stars at this location is reduced .",
    "secondly , evolution on the rgb speeds up as stars move towards brighter luminosities , so the expected number of stars scales inversely with the luminosity in a volume limited sample ( but not in a magnitude limited sample ) .",
    "hence the higher the luminosity at which the bump occurs ( i.e. , the lower the metallicity ) , the lower the overall number of stars one should expect to observe and the harder it is to identify the bump .",
    "identified an lf bump in m92 by co - adding data for three very similar clusters .",
    "their determined value of @xmath66 @xmath83 @xmath84 differs slightly from that of @xcite who find @xmath66 @xmath83 @xmath85 based on the use of multiple clusters to determine a lf bump - metallicity relation",
    ". work by @xcite provides little evidence for a bump in the observed lf of m92 however recent work by @xcite using hst data suggests that it is present at a magnitude of @xmath66 @xmath83 @xmath86 . for ngc 5466",
    "@xcite identified a bump using statistical arguments .",
    "the bump in m15 was more easily identifiable through the use of hst data as was done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one possible cause for altering the location of the bump ( and hence the onset of thermohaline mixing ) in our models is to decrease the @xmath6 abundance @xcite .",
    "however , extrapolating from the @xcite results to match the observations would require an initial @xmath6 well below the big bang nucleosynthesis value .",
    "alternatively , if first dredge - up penetrates deeper than the models predict , then the hydrogen burning shell will encounter the homogenized region at lower luminosities . in figure",
    "[ fig : deep ] we plot our metal - poor model with solar scaled abundances , in which the convective envelope extended down to a mass of @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "we have included a model ( grey line ) with the same initial abundance but artificially homogenized ( mixed from the surface ) down to a mass of @xmath89 @xmath88 at the time of fdu .",
    "the results show that extending the depth of first dredge - up by about 15% in mass translates to the mixing beginning about one magnitude fainter .",
    "note that the artificial model undergoes a period of adjustment as it returns to the structure of the standard metal - poor model . during this brief phase",
    "the burning shell is closer to the homogenized region than the structure would dictate if deeper dredge - up occurred normally . as a consequence",
    "the temperatures are such that @xmath1 is easily destroyed but carbon depletion is still inefficient ; this can be seen in figure [ fig : deep ] .",
    "@xcite call this situation a `` burning limited '' regime .",
    "the material is efficiently transported to the desired regions but the processing is inefficient due to the burning conditions .",
    "the artificial model therefore has less @xmath1 to drive the mixing near the tip of the rgb when the conditions are more conducive to carbon depletion , a regime @xcite call `` transport limited '' . in this scenario the inefficient transport of material to the burning regions is the limiting factor in the processing .",
    "this however is a side issue stemming from the artificial model ; the important point is that one way for the models to match the observations is to make first dredge - up occur deeper in the low - metallicity stars but only low - metallicity stars in m92 and m15 .",
    "we are left wondering why there is such an inconsistent picture of globular clusters at low metallicity .",
    "m92 and m15 possess large spreads in [ c / fe ] whilst ngc 5466 shows a much narrower distribution .",
    "we find that in the cluster where we have uniform observations thermohaline mixing appears to model the depletion of carbon well .",
    "we have already discussed the possibility that combining studies in m15 may be effecting our interpretation of the data .",
    "although data for m92 has been homogenized it is still the amalgamation of three different studies .",
    "compiling data from various sources may lead to systematic errors .",
    "systematic offsets of 0.3 dex in [ c / fe ] are possible and could be the cause of the apparent contradiction . because we have two clusters at the same metallicity in m92 and m15 displaying similar behavior one has to wonder how likely it is that systematic offsets conspire in such a way to appear to give the same effect .",
    "we note that the clusters showing the largest discrepancy with standard models , are also the most massive . having measured the integrated v magnitudes of the three metal - poor clusters @xcite find that ngc 5466 ( @xmath90 ) is a lower mass system than m92 ( @xmath91 ) and m15 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this raises the question whether there is a correlation between cluster mass and the extent of primordial [ c / fe ] spread at low metallicitites .",
    "the clusters m15 and m92 may have been able to sustain a greater degree of primordial inhomogeneous carbon enrichment than ngc 5466 , with a resulting greater dispersion in [ c / fe ] at all magnitudes on the main sequence and red giant branch than in ngc 5466 .",
    "the greater range in [ c / fe ] along the rgb of m15 and m92 can contribute to a greater observational uncertainty in identifying the magnitude at which carbon depletions produced by extra mixing set in . by contrast , a smaller primordial carbon spread in ngc 5466 produces a more tightly defined locus of [ c / fe ] versus @xmath66 on the rgb of that cluster , making it a preferable test case for mixing studies . when comparing the r - process elements both m92 and m15 show similar star - to - star variations @xcite ( although this has recently been questioned by @xcite ) which may add additional support to the na and o abundance evidence that both clusters have sustained heterogeneous enrichment across a range of chemical elements .",
    "it would be interesting to determine the o , na , and r - process element patterns in ngc 5466 to see if they are more homogeneous than in m92 and m15 , as a mass - dependent primordial enrichment scenario would anticipate .",
    "it is of course possible that thermohaline mixing does not govern the surface composition of low mass giants .",
    "it is not the only process by which mixing may occur in the radiative zone .",
    "mechanisms such as those listed in section [ intro ] may also be involved .",
    "the way in which these mechanisms interact is uncertain and as they are inherently three - dimensional our understanding of their behavior will improve with the study of these processes in hydrodynamical codes @xcite .",
    "still , the current generation of 1d codes are the precursors to more sophisticated modelling and much insight can be gained through them .",
    "one - dimensional spherically - symmetric models with multiple extra - mixing mechanisms include those of and , both of whom demonstrate that the thermohaline mixing diffusion coefficient is larger than the radial component of rotational mixing .",
    "the former also show the thermohaline coefficient to be larger than that of magnetic buoyancy .",
    "these codes do not explicitly treat the interaction of the mixing mechanisms and how any given instability may react due to the presence of other processes ; rather , they simply add the diffusion co - efficients .",
    "have investigated an instance of multi - process interaction through linear analysis and argue that magnetic fields could serve to inhibit the effects of thermohaline mixing .    and",
    "@xcite have produced detailed rotational - thermohaline mixing models for stars of various mass and metallicity .",
    "they find rotation leads to a deeper penetration of the convective envelope than their non - rotating models .",
    "this allows rotational models to begin thermohaline mixing at fainter magnitudes than their static models ; this may go some way to reconciling the magnitude at which stars in m92 and m15 begin mixing .",
    "it should be noted that low - mass , low - metallicity rotational models have been produced by and @xcite and in the former , the depth of first dredge - up depends on the rotational model used .",
    "a window of 0.13 magnitudes is possible for the location of the bump depending on the treatment of rotational physics .",
    "that is , different implementations of rotation can move the location of the lf bump to higher or lower magnitudes .",
    "different models of rotational mixing are at play here , in much the same way that different codes produce different third dredge - up results based on the treatment of convective stability .",
    "however stochastic variations such as rotation , may lead to deeper first dredge - up in the stars of m15 and m92 . @xcite",
    "have shown that stars on the horizontal branch of m13 rotate twice as fast as those on the horizontal branch of m3 .",
    "although we find no major discrepancies between the location of the lf bump in these two clusters ( 0.07 magnitudes @xcite ) , in the case of m15 and m92 the effect of rotation on the depth of the fdu may be more pronounced .",
    "why the stars in m13 would rotate faster than the stars in m3 would also require an explanation .",
    "whilst it is generally agreed that the burning of @xmath1 in a homogenized zone causes an instability , the efficiency of the resultant mixing has been the cause for debate .",
    "the exact value of _",
    "c@xmath19 _ to adopt remains contentious .",
    "recent multi - dimensional models of thermohaline mixing by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite support the view of and the suggestion by that the  aspect ratio \" , @xmath17 , of the rising element should take a value of @xmath93 ( _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath94 ) .",
    "laboratory experiments by stommel and faller published in @xcite have lead @xcite and to prefer a value of @xmath17 somewhere closer to @xmath95 ( _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath96 ) .",
    "indeed there is great empirical evidence to prefer this value as it appears to match observations of stars across a great range of mass and metallicity .",
    "the mechanism is an elegant means of matching c and n abundances in various stars as well as ensuring measurements of @xmath1 in hii regions are consistent with predictions from stellar models and big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "canonical models predict that low - mass , main - sequence stars are net producers of @xmath1 which is returned to the ism through mass loss . @xcite have shown that about 90% of the @xmath1 produced on the main sequence must be destroyed to reconcile the two fields .",
    "our preferred value of _ _",
    "c@xmath19__@xmath20 matches the carbon and nitrogen in clusters and also destroys over 90% of the @xmath1 in the star before the tip of the rgb",
    ". the lower value of _ _ c@xmath19__@xmath21 once again creates a discrepancy between measurements of @xmath1 in hii regions as only @xmath97 of the initial @xmath1 is destroyed meaning low - mass stars are once again producers of @xmath1 .",
    "it is the aim of this work and in @xcite to rely on empirical evidence to determine the best value of _",
    "c@xmath19 _ to use in the 1d codes . in the models presented here _",
    "c@xmath19 _ has been fixed at a value of 1000 .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies where the same factor has reproduced observations of globular cluster stars @xcite , field stars and where the mixing has been used to explain the dichotomy between extremely metal poor stars and carbon enhanced metal poor stars @xcite ( although the latter point is in disagreement with @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that once _",
    "c@xmath19 _ exceeds 1000 , the processing enters into the burning limited regime whereby increasing the diffusion coefficient has little effect on the final surface abundances .",
    "they also show values of _ _",
    "c@xmath19__@xmath98 simply lead to less mixing than is required to match the observations .",
    "although we are modelling the mixing as _ diffusive _ it is in fact an _ advective _ process .",
    "we have implemented a linear model of thermohaline mixing which operates via a diffusion equation .",
    "recent 3d numerical simulations of thermohaline mixing @xcite find blob - like structures , which are identified with the aspect ratio of the idealized  fingers \" in the 1d derivation of @xcite .",
    "it is from this identification that the preference for low values of _",
    "c@xmath19 _ in the numerical simulations is based .",
    "numerical simulations are a very powerful tool , but are subject to numerous caveats - resolution ( time and space ) , viscosity ( numerical and molecular ) , and extrapolation to stellar conditions ( e.g. , prandtl numbers that are @xmath99 too large ) . in view of these uncertainties",
    "we feel it premature to draw definite conclusions from the numerical simulations . nonetheless , if the low values of _",
    "c@xmath19 _ coming from the simulations prove to hold then it would result in a conclusion that either the diffusive approximation to thermohaline mixing used here is not applicable or that thermohaline mixing is too weak to produce the observed carbon depletions of globular cluster red giants .",
    "we have modelled the depletion of carbon via thermohaline mixing on the rgb of the intermediate metallicity clusters m3 and m13 as well as the metal poor clusters ngc 5466 , m92 and m15 .",
    "we conclude :    * thermohaline mixing in the presence of primordial enrichment can account for the carbon variation seen in m3 and m13 .",
    "the spread of carbon along the rgb in both clusters can be covered by the same set of models . in order to match the main - sequence spread in m13 , we require a model further depleted in [ c / fe ] . this model however , predicts that some stars on the rgb should have [ c / fe ] values lower than seen .",
    "the majority of stars in m13 are enriched in nitrogen whilst about half the stars in m3 appear to be cn strong .",
    "the results from the hybrid picture here are consistent with the findings of @xcite and their requirements to match the horizontal branch morphologies of the clusters . in their work the enriched @xmath6 of the second population acts as the second parameter and helps dictate where the star falls along the horizontal branch .",
    "the stars in m13 that are most enriched in [ n / fe ] suggest they were formed with some primary nitrogen ( higher c+n+o than those in m3 ) .",
    "* thermohaline mixing can explain carbon depletion with magnitude in ngc 5466 .",
    "a single solar scaled model is sufficient to explain the cluster even though a modest cn spread has been determined @xcite .",
    "our models provide a good fit for this cluster if we adopt the lf bump determined by @xcite .",
    "however , the data do not exclude the possibility ngc 5466 is depleting carbon before the lf bump as seems to be the case for m15 and m92 .",
    "* in m92 and m15 we have combined observations of [ c / fe ] from multiple studies .",
    "thermohaline mixing is unable to reproduce the evolution of carbon along the giant branch in these clusters .",
    "the models do not deplete carbon rapidly enough along the rgb .",
    "in addition depletion appears to begin before first dredge - up in m92 , although this may be due to the fact we only have a few observations at low luminosity . a targeted study at low luminosity is required to confirm if the cluster has the same spread in [ c / fe ] as m15 .",
    "both clusters appear to be mixing before the lf bump and bright stars are not observed near the predicted carbon abundances for initial [ c / fe]=0 . *",
    "both m92 and m15 seem to require deeper fdu in order for the models to fit the current observations but this is not the case for ngc 5466 .",
    "* a consideration that inevitably has to serve as a caveat to our discussions is that the comparison between the thermohaline - mixing models and the [ c / fe ] as a function of magnitude data may be hindered by the heterogeneity of the latter , particularly in clusters such as m92 and m15 where zero - point offsets of up to 0.3 dex may exist between the various data sources compiled .",
    "although attempts have been made to compensate for these , it remains nonetheless a source of concern .",
    "determining the behavior of carbon to faint luminosities on the rgb in both m92 and m15 as well as m3 , using a single spectrograph and data analysis system could provide a more homogeneous and rigorous test of our models .",
