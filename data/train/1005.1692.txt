    "precision continuous - wave ( cw ) nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements over the entire magnetization curve of euo have been carried out and the behavior of these data is analyzed both in the spin - wave and in the critical regions .",
    "the low - temperature data exhibit a clear - cut @xmath3 behavior , at variance with the expectations of conventional spin - wave theory .",
    "the critical region power - law fit , however , agrees with other previous measurements , within experimental error .    currently , there is still great interest in the study of euo because of the varied and multifaceted characteristics it displays . among others ,",
    "oxygen - rich or gd - doped euo shows colossal magnetoresistance , while eu - rich euo exhibits a change in conductivity of 13 orders of magnitude in its insulator to metal transition@xmath4 .",
    "some current studies of euo have a practical angle ( spintronics ) , while others focus on testing theories ( such as the kondo - lattice model ) . while much is not yet clear in this broader area , the fundamental behavior of the localized spin ( pure heisenberg ) model in euo is also being put into question by recent measurements@xmath5 .",
    "the results of the current low - temperature data will hopefully shed additional light on this latter issue .",
    "the principal focus of this paper is the unconventional ( spin - wave ) behavior of euo at low temperatures in the context of a pattern of such behavior in other simple magnetic systems . in addtion",
    ", the critical - region parameters are examined .    while a strict @xmath3 low - temperature behavior in pure euo was reported@xmath6 early on ,",
    "those measurements were not backed up with numerical evidence .",
    "the current measurements are presented in tabular form ( see table  [ tab : datatable ] ) and show a linear - fit to @xmath3 with an excellent @xmath7 . in recent years , two alternative semi - empirical spin - wave schemes",
    "have been proposed to explain the simple power - law behaviors displayed by magnetic systems ( in many cases not recognized by the original authors ) , beginning with the very first nmr measurement of a magnetically ordered system , @xmath8 2h@xmath9o@xmath10 .",
    "one scheme was developed by u. koebler@xmath11 , and one by n. bykovetz@xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath3 behavior found in the current euo nmr data is consistent with both schemes .",
    "the scheme of bykovetz , if further validated , implies that the conventional bloch result ( @xmath15 for 3d and @xmath16 for 2d ) determines the power - law behaviors , but with an absence of any lattice - dependent effects ( i.e. , the dyson @xmath17 term , expected in 3d ferromagnets , is missing ) .",
    "the general implication would be that even in localized - spin magnetic systems such as the europium chalcogenides , the exchange interactions are somehow long - ranged , and/or the spin waves propagate in a spin - density - polarized medium ( band ) .",
    "it is well known that a model of ferromagnetism , in which the magnetization can vary continuously ( as opposed to having discrete spins at localized sites ) results in spin waves that display a pure @xmath15 behavior with no `` lattice - correction '' terms .",
    "the recent optical measurements by miyazaki , et al.@xmath5 , suggest that , in fact , the heisenberg - dyson picture of localized exchange interactions may not be quite correct .",
    "last but not least , the measurements above , particularly the 4.2k domain - wall measurement , as well as those of boyd@xmath18 , give no evidence of a quadrupole splitting , whereas spin - echo nmr measurements invariably do .",
    "an extended discussion of this problem is given in ref 1 .",
    "the issue at this point is unresolved .",
    "one could conjecture that the domain - wall resonance in cw measurements somehow averages over the electric field gradients . on the spin - echo side , the source of the difficulty may lie in the uncertainties of the multi - layered analyses of the complex spin - echo measurements ( see ref 1 ) .",
