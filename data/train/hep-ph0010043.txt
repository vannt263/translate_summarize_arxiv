    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite is a low momentum effective field theory for qcd . for the physics of pions , kaons and eta mesons , chpt organizes the infinite set of possible interactions into a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the chiral scale , @xmath1 .",
    "although no precise definition of @xmath1 is required , it is understood to be o(1 gev ) : @xmath2 powers of @xmath3 appear as natural suppression factors in the calculation of the loop diagrams in chpt , and the @xmath4 meson is the lightest hadron which does not appear explicitly in the chpt lagrangian .",
    "the crucial test of chpt comes from the explicit calculation of observables to see whether higher order terms in the expansion really give smaller contributions , and the literature contains many such successful examples.@xcite    since no baryon is light in comparison to @xmath1 , it is difficult to include them into chpt without destroying the systematic expansion .",
    "recent work on baryon chpt is producing interesting new suggestions@xcite , but we will use the traditional solution , heavy baryon chpt ( hbchpt)@xcite , which is a double expansion in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    in the present work , the chiral lagrangian is constructed on a spacetime lattice , where the inverse lattice spacing plays the role of a momentum cutoff . because the lattice spacing appears directly in the chirally - symmetric lagrangian , the chiral properties of calculations are assured .",
    "the lattice - regularized hbchpt lagrangian is not unique ( we will choose an isotropic hypercubic lattice ) but the continuum limit is unique and is the familiar continuum - defined chiral lagrangian . since observable quantities can not depend on the regularization and renormalization prescriptions ,",
    "any valid lattice implementation must reproduce the results of dimensional regularization in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "in contrast to dimensional regularization , lattice regularization shows the power divergences explicitly .",
    "these divergences can also be seen with a nonlattice cutoff , but this is typically invoked at the time of integration rather than directly in the lagrangian , so care is required to be sure that chiral symmetry is not violated by the cutoff procedure .",
    "one example of research that relies upon information about power divergences is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a nonlattice cutoff was used to discuss the convergence of hbchpt and the scale of baryon substructure .",
    "lattice qcd simulations are always performed with a nonzero lattice spacing , and they typically use unphysical quark masses as well .",
    "chpt is regularly employed for the extrapolations to physical results.@xcite lattice - regularized chpt offers an analytic way to study discretization errors in these chiral extrapolations .",
    "although lattice - regularized chpt does not have a unique lagrangian , it does allow a determination of the typical size of discretization errors as a function of the quark masses and the lattice spacing .",
    "the connection between lattice chpt and lattice qcd has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limits of strong coupling and large @xmath7 .    in section [ sec2 ] of the present work , an su(3 ) meson lagrangian",
    "is constructed at leading and next - to - leading chiral order on a spacetime lattice , and the meson masses and renormalization constants are calculated .",
    "this allows a comparison to the work of shushpanov and smilga@xcite who calculated the quadratically - divergent pieces of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and wavefunction renormalization in an su(2 ) lattice theory .",
    "section [ sec3 ] of the present work contains the meson - baryon lagrangian .",
    "a calculation of the baryon masses and the pion - nucleon sigma term is shown to produce the familiar dimensional regularization results as the lattice spacing approaches zero . in section [ sec4 ] , the baryon masses and the pion - nucleon sigma term are discussed for nonzero lattice spacing , and section [ sec5 ] contains a concluding discussion .",
