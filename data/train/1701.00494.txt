    "the nature of long range rapidity correlations in hadron production observed in proton - proton ( p - p ) and proton(deuteron)-nucleus ( p - a ) collisions at the lhc and rhic has been a subject of intense investigation during the last several years @xcite .",
    "the big question to be answered is whether these correlations arise due to strong collective effects in final state interactions , or due to quasi collectivity present in the initial state wave function which is imprinted on the spectrum of produced particles .",
    "since first principle analysis of hadron production in a dense environment is very hard , it makes sense to look at simpler probes of this system .",
    "prompt photons have been one such probe that has been used to probe the putative quark - gluon - plasma state created at the early stages of heavy ion collisions @xcite . since photon interactions are weak , the correlations between emitted photons , if such exist would most certainly probe the structure of initial state alone , and it is interesting to see what can be learned from it . this was the motivation of our previous papers on the subject @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we considered production of two photons from the same quark in reaction of the type ( shown in ) , q+a(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + ( q ) + x , [ 2pg - old ] and have found interesting correlated structure albeit short range in rapidity compared to the di - hadron correlations . here , we consider production of two photons from two valence quarks , i.e. process of the type ( shown in ) , q+q+a(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + ( q ) + ( q^)+ x. [ 2pg - new ] naively one might think that such independent emission process does not lead to correlations in double photon production .",
    "however this is not necessarily the case .",
    "since photons are bosons , upon further reflection one expects to see the hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) correlations between photons emitted from two independent sources .",
    "such correlations involving gluons were discussed in the context of hadron production in p - a scattering in the cgc approach in @xcite . in principle",
    "they result in a peak for production of same sign transverse momentum pairs , with the radius of correlation in momentum space given by the inverse gluonic radius of the proton .",
    "the hadron hbt signal is however rather fragile and is easily masked by final state effects .",
    "one expects the photon hbt to be much more resilient .",
    "one of the main purpose in this paper is to qualitatively study this effect .",
    "although our main interest and explicit calculations are geared towards di - photons production , the approach itself is more general and can be applied to any process of the double parton scattering ( dps ) type ( given in below ) .",
    "the topic of multiparton interactions is one of the most important focal points of studying the multi - particle correlations in pqcd . in the cgc approach , at leading order ,",
    "the so - called single patron scattering ( sps ) processes in the pqcd framework , correspond to a single parton scattering to the cgc shock wave .",
    "the cgc shock wave includes the interaction of a parton to all orders with the background color field of the target .",
    "therefore , in the cgc approach , the corresponding sps contribution for two - particle production is obtained by considering the following process + a(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + x. [ sps ] effects of saturation on di - hadron correlations originating from sps have been studied in @xcite",
    ". a potentially `` richer '' source of correlations are processes where two partons in one projectile hadron collide with the cgc shock wave .",
    "such a process in the language of pqcd , is the so - called double parton scattering ( dps ) , + + a(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + x. [ 2p - new ] in the cgc framework processes where two observed particles originate from different sources of the color field were studied in the soft limit in refs.@xcite . while for sps , the cgc and pqcd approaches are conveniently bridged with the help of the hybrid formalism @xcite , such connection has not been made for dps so far .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the hybrid formalism to include the dps in the cgc approach .",
    "we show that the cross - section of the dps in the cgc is calculable in terms of new nonperturbative objects , the generalized two parton distribution ( 2gpd ) functions .",
    "we propose that the properties of the 2gpds can be studied in the small - x kinematics within this hybrid cgc approach .",
    "in particular we show that the di - photon hbt correlations are naturally express in terms of the di - quark 2gpds .",
    "we also point out that di - hadron correlations at high energy ( in forward direction ) should be sensitive to di - gluon 2gpd , and such processes should be included as corrections to the calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "we will be working within a variant of the `` hybrid '' approximation @xcite which is appropriate for forward photon production . in",
    "the hybrid cgc approach , we assume that the small - x gluon modes of the nucleus have a large occupation number so that the target nucleus can be described in terms of a classical color field . this should be a good approximation for large enough nucleus at high - energy .",
    "this color field emerges from the classical yang - mills equation with a source term provided by faster partons .",
    "the renormalization group equations which govern the separation between the soft and hard models are then given by the non - linear jalilian - marian , iancu , mclerran , weigert , leonidov , kovner ( jimwlk ) evolution equations @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "we further assume that the projectile proton is in the dilute regime and can be described in ordinary perturbative approach .",
    "the process involves double parton scattering , and therefore standard collinear parton distribution functions are not sufficient to characterize the incoming proton state .",
    "we will therefore need to model the proton structure in a slightly more refined way .            in the following we will derive the di - photon cross - section starting from some simple and intuitive assumptions about the wave function of the two incoming quarks inside the projectile hadron .",
    "we show that at large @xmath0 within the cgc approach , the cross - section is determined by the dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "we also show that within the standard collinear factorization approach the hbt peak has zero width .",
    "this is not at all surprising , since the width is expected to be of the order of inverse proton size , while in collinear factorization this size is effectively infinite .",
    "thus any realistic study requires us to go beyond the standard collinear factorization . since the basic process we consider involves double parton scattering , our final expressions requires double parton distributions .",
    "these objects are not well determined experimentally , and therefore we do not attempt detailed quantitative predictions .",
    "instead we limit ourselves to qualitative analysis based on a simple model of the initial wave function .",
    "we show that the width of the hbt peak is indeed given by the inverse size of this distribution in coordinate space .",
    "therefore , the hbt measurements for two - particle production such as prompt photon pairs provide useful information about the nonperturbative 2gpds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we first provide a concise description of theoretical framework for calculating the dps contribution in the cgc approach . as an example , we focus on calculating the cross - section of a pair of prompt photon and a pair of jet in high - energy p - a collisions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results for inclusive prompt di - photon production obtained from the dps contribution in the cgc approach",
    ". we will also discuss hanbury - brown - twiss correlations for di - photon production in high - energy p - p and p - a collisions .",
    "we summarize our main results in sec .",
    "in this section , we present the basics of computation of the cross - section for the process given in .",
    "although , our formulation here is valid for the general production given in , in the following we focus on a case where two produced particles are prompt photons , q(p_1)+q(p_2)+a(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + ( q ) + ( q^)+ x. [ 2-ph ] we consider the leading order approximation in a dilute - dense collisions at forward rapidity , for example in proton - proton or / and in proton - nucleus collisions . in this setup , the two valence quarks from the projectile wave function emit two photons via bremsstrahlung .",
    "the _ two _ photon+jet systems are put on shell by interacting coherently over the whole longitudinal extent of the target , see .",
    "although the scattering of the two quarks is independent , the production of two photon+jet systems is not independent due to the interference diagrams ( shown in ) .",

    "should not be in a pure state but rather should be described by a density matrix after integrating out of the other spectator partons in the proton . in practical terms",

    "the interference term expresses the hbt correlations . we note that under assumption of naive collinear factorization where the transverse momenta of all incoming partons vanish , we have @xmath83 and thus the hbt peak has zero width .    to understand the qualitative features of this expression beyond this naive approximation we consider the following special kinematics .",
    "first we take the two photons to be soft , @xmath84 .",
    "we also assume that the transverse momentum of the two photons are large , but are not too different from each other @xmath85 . in the spirit of parton model that the intrinsic transverse momentum in the proton wave function is small , and",
    "thus the integration over @xmath53 and @xmath54 is dominated by the region @xmath86 .",
    "additionally we assume that the dipole scattering amplitude is saturated , and thus the momentum transfer is strongly peaked at @xmath87 . in the following we use the notation @xmath88 . in this kinematics",
    "we obtain , @xmath89\\approx-\\frac { 4(k^-_1)^2}{s/2}\\frac{1}{x_1x_2}\\frac{\\q'\\cdot\\q}{k^4}.\\ ] ] @xmath90\\approx-\\frac { 4(k^-_2)^2}{s/2}\\frac{1}{x_1x_2}\\frac{\\q'\\cdot\\q}{k^4}.\\ ] ] in this kinematics we therefore obtain for the interference contribution to the cross - section & & | _ k_1 ^ - k_2 ^ - + & & n^(2 ) ( + _ 1-_1)n^(2 ) ( ^+_2-_2 ) d(x_1,x_2 , _ 1,_2 , ) .assuming rotational invariance of the dipole scattering amplitude we can estimate the average value of momentum as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an effective interaction area , @xmath93 is saturation scale of the system and we have used the fact that @xmath94 therefore we obtain , | _ dx_1dx_2 d(x_1,x_2 , _ 1,_2 , ) .",
    "we did not indicate the virtuality of the double parton distribution in the above , but it is clearly given by the large momentum scale in the problem , which is the transverse momentum of the individual photons @xmath95 .",
    "the physics of this correlation is clearly the same as that of hbt , since we find correlation between emitted bosons when the emitting sources are uncorrelated .",
    "indeed the behavior of this interference term is precisely a typical hbt behavior .",
    "it is the easiest to see in the approximation where the two incoming partons are taken to be uncorrelated in the proton wave function . in this case",
    "we assume @xmath96 which leads to eq.([dps1 ] ) with a factorized g_n(x , p,)=p(x , p)p^*(x , p+ ) . assuming a simple gaussian for the intrinsic momentum dependence ( x , p)e^-r^2p^2 , where @xmath97 clearly has the meaning of the quark radius of the proton , we have [ formfa ] d(x_1,x_2 , _ 1,_2 , ) = f_q(x_1 , k_t^2)f_q(x_2 , k_t^2)e^-r^2 ^ 2 , where the function @xmath98 is the usual quark pdf at virtuality @xmath99 .",
    "the interference thus leads to enhancement of the cross - section for @xmath100 - a typical hbt correlation behavior .",
    "the radius of the proton can be therefore directly measured by measuring photon correlations .",
    "the magnitude of the effect drops pretty fast at large transverse momentum of the photons , but presumably at @xmath101 the interference piece should not be significantly suppressed relative to the independent production piece .",
    "another popular assumption in the literature is to approximate the gdp by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the conventional parton transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) and @xmath104 is the nonperturbative proton form - factor .",
    "this again leads to with the gaussian factor replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "the form factor is maximal at @xmath105 , and decreases on the momentum scale @xmath106 , which indeed has the meaning of the inverse proton radius .",
    "we note that a similar form factor for gluons was discussed in the literature and the functional form @xmath107 was extracted from exclusive vector meson production with @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the value of the proton size extracted from @xmath109 is rather small , which is consistent with many other experimental indications of a small gluonic radius of the proton @xcite . for di - photon hbt",
    "we expect a different , and larger transverse distance scale to dominate the hbt correlations .",
    "in this paper we have developed the hybrid calculational approach to forward particle production to include dps processes in the saturated environment . the main technical ingredient that appears in this approach",
    "is the generalized double parton distribution ( 2gpd ) functions .",
    "we studied in details the di - photon correlations that arise due to the dps process .",
    "we found that these correlations reflect the hanbury - brown - twiss effect , and lead to enhanced double photon production when the transverse moment of the two photons are within the inverse proton radius of each other . at high momentum of produced photons the correlated piece decreases quite fast ( as @xmath110 ) , but it should give a significant enhancement when the photon momenta are not much larger than the target saturation scale .",
    "we showed that the width of the hbt peak probes the transverse distance between the parton of the pair in the 2gpds .",
    "therefore , the hbt measurements in two - particle production such as prompt photon pairs provide useful information about the nonperturbative 2gpds .    it would be interesting to compare the magnitude of the correlated cross - section we find here with the correlations generated through sps @xcite .",
    "we did not attempt a quantitative comparison , since the 2gpd s are not known with significant accuracy .",
    "it is interesting to note however , that parametrically the dps contribution can be competitive with the sps one , especially for intermediate transverse momentum photons with @xmath111 not much larger than @xmath93 .",
    "although one requires two quarks to scatter , in the saturated regime where the quark scattering amplitude is of the order one , this is not suppressed by powers of @xmath23 . additionally , the dps is enhanced by a factor roughly equal to the number of quarks in the proton .",
    "thus all in all the dps contribution can be comparable to the sps one .",
    "it would be very interesting if such correlations could be observed experimentally .",
    "finally , we note that the dps hbt correlations are not limited to photon production .",
    "in particular these effects were not included in the cgc calculation of di - hadron production at forward rapidities @xcite .",
    "quite clearly a calculation similar to ours can be performed for double gluon inclusive production and it should also lead to hbt correlations . indeed we expect that for gluons the suppression of the correlated part at high @xmath95 will be significantly smaller than for photons , since it involves production of only two high-@xmath95 particles in the final state , rather than four as in the present case",
