    "<S> the experimental sequence to probe this behavior and to produce photons is as follows : the ion is manipulated by laser beams transverse to the cavity axis , starting with the preparation into the @xmath10d@xmath12 state by optical pumping on the 369 nm transition . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently a laser pulse at 935 nm excites the ion resonantly into the @xmath14d[@xmath15@xmath11 state from where it decays either to the @xmath10s@xmath11 state or back to the @xmath10d@xmath12 state . in free space </S>",

    "<S> we benchmark the prospects of using the polarization state of the extracted photons for faithful transfer of quantum information between ion and photon . to this end </S>",

    "<S> first , the ion is prepared in the @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) zeeman state of the @xmath10d@xmath12 manifold by optical pumping using @xmath56 and @xmath57 polarized 935 nm light in combination with 369 nm light  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , a short pulse excites the ion to the @xmath58 zeeman state of the @xmath14d[3/2]@xmath11 manifold , and a photon is subsequently emitted into the cavity mode . because we apply a magnetic field of approximately 3 gauss along the cavity axis , only the @xmath57 and @xmath59 transitions are stimulated by the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the emission of a @xmath59 polarized photon leaves the ion in the @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) zeeman state of the @xmath10d@xmath12 manifold whereas a @xmath57 photon is accompanied by a decay to the @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) state . </S>",
    "<S> the small zeeman splitting of the transition frequencies does not affect the coupling to the cavity because of the large cavity bandwidth .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall state after the photon emission depends on the ratio of the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the @xmath59 and @xmath57 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the considered emission process the normalized @xmath62 state @xmath63 reads @xmath64 in order to measure the correlations between the spin state of the ion and the polarization of the photon , we read out the spin state of the ion after the photon emission . to this end </S>",

    "<S> the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients are stated next to the transition arrows . * </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) * spin state of the ion depending of the polarization of the detected photon . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  3b shows the measured spin state conditioned on the detection of a @xmath59 or a @xmath57 polarized photon . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the expected strong correlation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the emitted light field contains more @xmath59 than @xmath57 polarized photons due to the unequal clebsch - gordan coefficients of the two transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath57 polarized photons is @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations of the correlations and @xmath68 from the ideal state @xmath63 are in agreement with the expected errors from the state preparation , the background and the dark count rate of the spcm .    finally , complementary to the photon emission experiments we study the absorption of the ion when the cavity mode is externally pumped by a faint laser beam @xcite . in order to measure the probability for incoming photons to excite the ion into the @xmath14d[3/2]@xmath11 state we take advantage of the large branching ratio of the decay from the @xmath14d[3/2]@xmath11 to the @xmath10s@xmath11 state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an excitation event will predominantly lead to a subsequent decay to the @xmath10s@xmath11 state which we read out by scattering on the 369 nm transition . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore define the absorption per photon @xmath69 as the probability for an incoming photon to transfer the ion from the @xmath10d@xmath12 to the @xmath10s@xmath11 state .    </S>",

    "<S> the number of photons impinging upon the cavity is determined from the light reflected by the cavity . </S>",

    "<S> polarized light the absorption is @xmath74 . compared to single ion experiments in free space @xcite </S>",
    "<S> our observed absorption is almost 50% larger despite the much more unfavourable level structure . </S>",
    "<S> imperfect initialization of the spin state leads to a residual absorption of @xmath57 polarized probe light with @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the stated probabilities are a lower bound for the photon absorption because not every excitation event leads to a transfer to the @xmath10s@xmath11 state . </S>",
    "<S> the natural fraction of @xmath76 is reduced by the purcell effect and from the cavity - qed parameters we infer that the altered branching ratio is approximately 91% . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the absorption probabilities are slightly underestimated by 9% .    in the intermediate coupling regime ( @xmath77 ) </S>",
    "<S> the absorption of coherent probe light is approximately given by the cavity - enhanced optical depth @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observable cooperativity in the absorption experiment is expected to be reduced compared to the aforementioned emission experiments by several factors : branching ratio ( 0.91 ) , clebsch - gordan coefficient ( 0.75 ) , state preparation ( 0.9 ) , cavity in - coupling ( 0.8 ) . after including these factors </S>",
    "<S> the measured cooperativity in absorption is 40(20)% smaller than the cooperativity in emission . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the residual discrepancy to uncompensated micromotion along the cavity axis . </S>",
    "<S> micromotion induced sidebands lie within the cavity bandwidth but are resolved from the natural linewidth of the transition ( @xmath79 ) and therefore reduce the absorption of a weak near - monochromatic probe pulse stronger than the emission into the cavity mode .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated efficient photon emission and absorption by the ion via the fiber cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we have achieved efficient coupling between cavity and fiber mode and showed that the distortion of the photon polarization due to the intrinsic single - mode fiber coupling is small . </S>",
    "<S> further improvements of the efficiency can be made by employing cavities with higher finesse and improving the localization of the ion within the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown that absorption and scattering losses of high - reflective dielectric mirrors can be low enough to facilitate fiber - cavities with a finesse exceeding @xmath80  @xcite . with these future technical improvements , </S>",
    "<S> the trap and cavity geometry presented here can realize not only a large cooperativity @xmath81 but also the strong coupling regime between a single ion and a single photon .    </S>",
