    "the diagram gives a compact geometrical description of the conjugate ; the diagram of @xmath40 is obtained by reflecting the diagram of @xmath23 about the main diagonal .",
    "the _ code _ of a partition is a two - way infinite binary string in two symbols , say u , r. the string is infinitely u to the left , and infinitely r to the right , and represents a lattice path with unit up - steps ( for `` u '' ) and unit right - steps ( for `` r '' ) ; the path starts moving up the @xmath41-axis towards the origin , and ends moving out the @xmath42-axis away from the origin , and forms the lower right hand boundary of the diagram of the partition , when the diagram is placed with its upper left hand corner at the origin .",
