    "two dimensional quantum field theories in presence of a boundary have received an increasing attention in the last few years because of their important role in condensed matter physics ( especially on quantum impurity problems ) and in string theory ( d - branes ) .",
    "their integrable or conformal properties lead to the computation of a number of exact results ( boundary s - matrices @xcite , conformal boundary states @xcite , etc . see also @xcite and references indicated there ) .",
    "an interesting problem is to connect different boundary conformal field theories ( bcft ) by integrable renormalization group flows generated by boundary operators .",
    "the tricritical ising model is the conformal unitary minimal model with central charge @xmath4 .",
    "its phase diagram in presence of boundaries , with the bulk of the system maintained at the critical point , contains various fixed points ( that are precisely boundary conformal field theories ) connected by renormalization group flows @xcite . among them , those generated by perturbing a fixed point with the magnetic boundary field @xmath1 are integrable .",
    "one of the two flows departing from the bcft @xmath0 moves to a superposition of cardy - type boundary states , @xmath2 .",
    "this is the simplest occurrence of the general observation @xcite that the boundary interactions do not make a distinction between pure states or superposition of states .",
    "actually , increasing the central charge of the minimal models , one expect more and more the appearance of superposition of states @xcite so that the analysis presented here is a crucial step toward a quite general phenomenon .",
    "physically speaking , boundary correlation functions of pure states satisfy the cluster property while this is not true for superposition of states .",
    "this is an indication of a first order phase transition occurring close to a bcft that is not a pure state @xcite .",
    "the flow @xmath5 is studied here using a lattice approach to formulate tba equations , as described with great detail in @xcite on which the present article is heavily built . for convenience , the same notations will be used .",
    "this flow was identified in @xcite by the boundary s matrix ; it preserves supersymmetry @xcite ; a tba system for the ground state only was given @xcite in a different channel ( periodic ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ s_critpnt ] ,",
    "the pattern of zeros for the boundary critical point on a finite lattice will be described and the finitized partition function will appear as a superposition of finitized characters @xcite . in section  [ s_3mech ] ,",
    "the flow will be recognized to be in the `` variable @xmath6 '' family , and the mapping between finitized characters will be provided . in section",
    "[ s_tba ] , the specific set of tba equations for this flow will be derived and numerically solved . in appendix",
    "a there is a summary of properties of gaussian polynomials . in appendix",
    "b the expression for the energy at the bcft @xmath7 will be proved . in appendix",
    "c the selection rules for the integration constants will be given , that also apply to all the cases discussed in @xcite .",
    "an @xmath8 faces double row transfer matrix with boundary conditions @xmath9 on the left / right boundaries is indicated by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spectral parameter , @xmath12 is the crossing parameter and @xmath13 are parameters associated to the boundary weights .",
    "if @xmath14 is chosen appropriately , the lattice boundary weight @xmath15 scales to the conformal boundary condition @xcite also labeled by @xmath15 @xcite . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "the only case that will be used is : @xmath16 the parameter @xmath17 will be kept fixed at the indicated value corresponding to the conformal boundary condition @xmath18 .    from @xcite",
    ", it is known that the continuum scaling limit of the double row transfer matrix @xmath19 is a realization of the @xmath20 conformal boundary conditions .",
    "this is obtained if the boundary parameter is chosen inside the real interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the choice of the middle point of the interval will be useful later when moving off criticality by the introduction of an imaginary part for @xmath22 .",
    "the number of faces @xmath8 is required to be even by the adjacency conditions .",
    "the pattern of the zeros of the eigenvalues @xmath23 of @xmath24 is relevant to the classification of the states , both for the lattice and for the continuum theory , and must be determined with numerical observations performed on lattices of small size @xmath25 ( in @xcite the name `` numerics on d '' was used ) . as typical for the @xmath3 lattice model @xcite , there are two analyticity strips @xmath26 and two types of strings .",
    "the 1-strings are single zeros appearing in the center of each strip @xmath27 while the 2-strings are pairs of zeros @xmath28 appearing on the edges of a strip , with the same imaginary part @xmath29 ( 2\\lambda,4\\lambda ) , & \\mbox{strip 2 . } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in the upper half plane , let @xmath30 , @xmath31 be the number of 1-strings and @xmath32 , @xmath33 the number of 2-strings in each strip .",
    "the following relations hold between the numbers of zeros : @xmath34 n_2 & = & \\frac{m_1}{2}-m_2 + 1 \\geqslant 0 \\end{array } \\right\\ } \\rightarrow m_1,m_2 ~~\\mbox{even.}\\ ] ] the states on the lattice and at the scaling limit are uniquely characterized by the _ non - negative quantum numbers _ @xmath35 ; they have the topological meaning that for a given 1-string , @xmath36 is the number of 2-strings with larger coordinate .",
    "this remains true at the scaling limit .",
    "the determination of the scaling energy corresponding to each eigenvalue is the crucial element to distinguish states in the @xmath37 or @xmath38 sectors . remembering that @xmath39 , the separation between levels is quite sharp . in spite of this ,",
    "the finite size effects for @xmath25 faces are still dominant on the accuracy of the energies , apart for the first few levels @xmath40 , so the complete distinction of states among the two sectors requires informations from the tba equations that will be introduced later . anticipating here these results , one has : @xmath41 this means that the discrimination is given by the lower object in the second strip :",
    "if it is a 2-string , the sector @xmath37 is selected , if it is a 1-string the sector @xmath38 is selected .",
    "the given conditions imply two useful necessary conditions for a state to be in the corresponding sector : @xmath42 the former is an enforcement of the second expression in ( [ n1n2 ] ) .",
    "the energy corresponding to each state is finally given by @xmath43 @xmath44 is precisely the @xmath45 cartan matrix .",
    "the complete and independent proof of this expression will be given in appendix b.    here a crucial observation can be done that there is a violation of the _ topological rule for the energy_. indeed , when only one sector is involved , if the relative position of a 1-string and a neighboring underlying 2-string are exchanged the energy increases of 1 unit .",
    "the opposite exchange reduces the energy of 1 unit @xcite .",
    "presently two sectors are considered and this rule is violated in precisely one case : if the lower objects in the second strip are a 1-string and an underlying 2-string ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , their exchange increases the energy of @xmath47 units .",
    "the opposite exchange reduces the energy of @xmath47 units .",
    "this corresponds to the kronecker s delta term in ( [ critenergy ] ) . in all the other cases the usual rule holds .",
    "notice that this violation is expected from counting arguments , namely with the usual rule only , there is no way to match the states given by @xmath24 with the states contained in @xmath7 . in table",
    "[ t22_1131 ] there is the first appearance of this violation , namely the infrared state is a state with 4 zeros in the first strip and 2 in the second ; their quantum numbers are respectively @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath50 , whose energy is @xmath51 , has two excitations , @xmath52 , with energy @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , with energy @xmath55 .",
    "the finitized partition function is defined as a sum on the states of a finite lattice where the energy of each state is fictitiously assumed to be equal to its scaling limit energy : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the modular parameter .",
    "now , it will be shown that the finitized partition function matches the sum of characters .",
    "the sum on states ( [ finitz ] ) can be split in two parts , for @xmath58 ( sector @xmath37 ) and for @xmath59 ( sector @xmath38 ) . using the gaussian polynomials and their properties as in appendix",

    "can be generalized to all the flows with the obvious addition of terms depending upon @xmath168 and a possibly non - zero term that takes into account the subtleties related to @xmath169 .",

    "then , taking the limit @xmath171 in the equations themselves , one can use the braid limit to express the asymptotic values of @xmath172 .",
    "this leads to : @xmath173 an implicit assumption was used , that all the 1-strings are in a finite position , @xmath174 , condition that is always satisfied except at the uv point .",
    "if this is violated , the actual value of the braid limit can change and the previous argument does nt hold . the correct uv rule can be obtained by the previous one observing that if along the flow one has @xmath175 , the content of zeros changes in the strip @xmath176 so that : @xmath177    the selection rules proven here hold for all the flows and all the conformal boundary conditions .",
