    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in the formal analysis and design of control systems .",
    "the formal analysis aims to check whether a control system satisfies desired specifications , while the formal design wants to construct a controller for control system so that it meets a given specification .",
    "early work in these fields is chiefly concerned with stability and reachability  @xcite .",
    "recently , more complex specifications are considered .",
    "these specifications may be described by such as temporal logic @xcite , regular expressions @xcite and transition systems @xcite . amongst , temporal logic , due to its resemblance to natural language and the existence of algorithms for model checking , is widely adopted to describe the desired properties .",
    "for example , linear temporal logic ( ltl ) is used to express specifications of discrete - time linear systems  @xcite and continuous - time linear systems @xcite .",
    "both computation tree logic ( ctl)@xcite and ltl@xcite are adopted to specify task of mobile robotics .    in the formal analysis and design , it is always difficult to deal with large - scale control systems because of the complexity and scale of such systems . to overcome this defect ,",
    "finite abstractions are extracted from these control systems .",
    "for instance , tabuada and pappas explore finite abstractions of discrete - time linear systems and present some critical properties of linear systems ensuring the existence of finite abstractions @xcite . based on finite partitions of the set of inputs or outputs ,",
    "finite symbolic models are constructed for nonlinear control systems in @xcite .",
    "a number of work has been devoted to finite abstractions of hybrid systems  @xcite .",
    "an excellent review of these work may be found in  @xcite .",
    "finite abstractions play an important role in the formal design of control systems @xcite . as an example , fig  [ fig : illust0 ] illustrates the function of finite abstraction in the formal design of linear system @xcite . given a linear system @xmath1 , tabuada and pappas provide an infinite transition system @xmath2 as the formal model of @xmath1 and construct a finite transition system @xmath3 as the finite abstraction of @xmath1 .",
    "the following result is a fundamental result in  @xcite , which lays the foundation of the design method of controllers presented in @xcite .",
    "_ @xmath2 and @xmath3 are bisimilar and share the same properties describe by linear temporal logic .",
    "_  ( @xmath4 )    thus , given an ltl specification @xmath5 , the formal design of @xmath2 can be equivalently performed on the finite abstraction @xmath3 .",
    "tabuada and pappas construct a controller @xmath6 of @xmath3 enforcing @xmath5 and demonstrate that @xmath2 satisfies @xmath5 under this controller as well .",
    "furthermore , based on this controller , a close - loop system @xmath7 satisfying @xmath5 is generated .",
    "similar methods are also adopted in @xcite .",
    "the research work , mentioned above , focuses on control systems without reference to disturbances . however , all physical systems are subject to some types of extraneous disturbances or noise during operation @xcite . in  @xcite and @xcite , pola and tabuada",
    "provide a framework to design controllers for systems affected by disturbances . to this end",
    ", they introduce symbolic abstractions for these systems . moreover , the notions of approximate simulation @xcite and alternating approximate bisimulation @xcite are introduced to capture the equivalence between symbolic abstractions and original control systems .    however , as we will reveal in section  [ sec : logical ] , pola and tabuada s finite ( symbolic ) abstractions and their original control systems do not always share the identical properties described by linear temporal logic ltl@xmath8 .",
    "roughly speaking , the result ( @xmath4 ) does not always hold for control systems with disturbances . thus",
    ", if we adopt the same specifications for the control systems and their finite abstractions , the formal design of the latter may not be helpful for the former . to overcome this obstacle , this paper introduces and explores a transformation of specification as illustrated in fig  [ fig : illust1 ] .        in this figure",
