    "in this section we review the innsbruck experiment . in section [ sec : npairs ] we calculate the probability distribution of finding @xmath2 photon - pairs and subsequently we compare this with the poisson distribution for @xmath2 photon - pairs . the difference between the two distributions , in terms of distinguishability , is evaluated by means of the so - called _ statistical distance _ in section [ stat ] .    in the innsbruck experiment , parametric down - conversion is used to create two entangled photon - pairs .",
    "one pair constitutes the entangled state shared between alice and bob , while the other is used by victor to create an ` unknown ' single - photon polarisation state @xmath1 : victor detects mode @xmath3 , shown in figure [ fig : innsbruck ] to prepare the single - photon input state in mode @xmath4 .",
    "this mode is sent to alice .",
    "a coincidence in the detection of the two outgoing modes of the beam - splitter ( alice s  incomplete  bell measurement ) tells us that alice s two photons are in a @xmath5 bell state @xcite .",
    "the remaining photon ( held by bob ) is now in the same unknown state as the photon prepared by victor because in this case the unitary transformation bob has to apply coincides with the identity , i.e. , doing nothing .",
    "bob verifies this by detecting his state along the same polarisation axis which was used by victor .",
    "a four - fold coincidence in the detectors of victor s state preparation , alice s bell measurement and bob s outgoing state indicate that quantum teleportation of a single - photon state is complete .",
    "there is however a complication which gave rise to a different interpretation of the experiment @xcite .",
    "analysis shows that the state detected by bob is a mixture of the vacuum and the original state @xcite ( to lowest order ) .",
    "this vacuum contribution occurs when the down - converter responsible for creating the input state @xmath1 yields two photon - pairs , while the other gives nothing .",
    "the detectors used in the experiment can not distinguish between one or several photons coming in , so victor s detection of mode @xmath3 in figure [ fig : innsbruck ] will not reveal the presence of more than one photon .",
    "a three - fold coincidence in the detectors of victor and alice is still possible , but bob has not received a photon and quantum teleportation has not been achieved .",
    "bob therefore needs to detect his state in order to identify successful quantum teleportation . when victor uses a detector which can distinguish between one or several photons this problem vanishes . however , currently such detectors require an operating environment of roughly @xmath0k @xcite .    in section [ generalised ]",

    ", we investigate the creation of entangled photon - pairs using weak parametric down - conversion @xcite . in this process",
    ", there is a small probability of creating more than one photon - pair simultaneously .",
    "one might expect that for sufficiently weak down - conversion the two pairs created by one source ( which give rise to the vacuum contribution in the teleported output state ) can be considered independent from each other .",
    "however , we show that this is not the case . in what follows",
    "we find it convenient to ` unfold ' the experimental setup according to figure [ model ] .",

    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two field modes with a particular polarisation along the @xmath7- and @xmath8-axis of a given coordinate system .",
    "we are working in the interaction picture of the hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of creating two entangled field modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 using weak parametric down - conversion . in the rotating wave approximation",
    "this hamiltonian reads ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 in this equation h.c",

    "this hypothesis can be tested by studying the distinguishability of the two distributions .      here , we study the distinguishability of the pair distribution calculated in the previous section and the poisson distribution . the poisson distribution for independently created objects is given by @xmath50 furthermore , rewrite the pair distribution in eq .",

    "are these probability distributions distinguishable ?",
    "naively one would say that for sufficiently weak down - conversion ( i.e. , when @xmath55 ) these distributions largely coincide , so that instead of the complicated pair - distribution ( [ eprdist2 ] ) we can use the poisson distribution , which is much easier from a mathematical point of view . the distributions are distinguishable when the ` difference ' between them is larger than the size of an average statistical fluctuation of the difference .",
    "this fluctuation depends on the number of samplings .",

    "( [ poisson ] ) is derived by requiring statistical independence of @xmath2 pairs and the pair distribution is distinguishable from the poisson distribution , the photon - pairs can not be considered to be independently produced , _ even in the weak limit_. in the analysis of the innsbruck experiment we need to take extra care due to this property of parametric down - converters .",
    "in this section we introduce the so - called _ fidelity _ for quantum teleportation .",
    "this is already recognised as an important tool in quantum information theory and it is therefore natural to consider teleportation criteria based upon it .",
    "subsequently , we discuss different points of view of the innsbruck experiment emerging from this concept .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the subset of events where successful bell - state and state - preparation detections have occurred ( all subsequent statements are _ conditioned _ on such events ) . since the interpretation of the experiment has become a slightly controversial issue , we treat this in some detail .    in order to define",
    "the fidelity , denote the input state by @xmath1 ( which is here assumed to be pure ) and the outgoing ( teleported ) state by a density matrix @xmath65 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath66 is the overlap between the incoming and the outgoing state : @xmath67 \\ ; .\\ ] ] it corresponds to the lower bound for the probability of mistaking @xmath65 for @xmath1 in any possible ( single ) measurement @xcite . when @xmath65 is an exact replica of @xmath1 then @xmath68 , and when @xmath65 is a imprecise copy of @xmath1 then @xmath69",
    "finally , when @xmath65 is completely othogonal to @xmath1 the fidelity is zero .    in the context of this paper ,",
    "the fidelity is used to distinguish between quantum teleportation and teleportation which could have been achieved ` classically ' .",
    "classical teleportation is the disembodied transport of some quantum state from alice to bob by means of a classical communication channel .",
    "there is _ no _ shared entanglement between alice and bob . since classical communication can be duplicated , such a scheme can lead to many copies of the transported output state ( so - called _ clones _ ) .",
    "classical teleportation with perfect fidelity ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) would then lead to the possibility of _ perfect _ cloning , thus violating the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "this means that the maximum fidelity for classical teleportation has an upper bound which is less than one .",
    "quantum teleportation , on the other hand , can achieve perfect fidelity ( and circumvents the no - cloning theorem by disrupting the original ) . to demonstrate _",
    "quantum _ teleportation therefore means @xcite that the teleported state should have a higher fidelity than possible for a state obtained by any scheme involving classical communication _",
    "alone_.    for classical teleportation of randomly sampled polarisations ,",
    "the maximum attainable fidelity is @xmath70 .",
    "when only linear polarisations are to be teleported , the maximum attainable fidelity is @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "these are the values which the quantum teleportation fidelity should exceed .    in the case of the innsbruck experiment",
    ", @xmath1 denotes the ` unknown ' linear polarisation state of the photon issued by victor .",
    "we can write the undetected outgoing state to lowest order as @xmath72 where @xmath21 is the vacuum state .",
    "the overlap between @xmath1 and @xmath65 is given by eq .",
    "( [ fiddef ] ) . in the innsbruck experiment",
    "the fidelity @xmath66 is then given by @xmath73 =    \\frac{|\\beta|^2}{|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2}\\ ; .\\ ] ] this should be larger than 3/4 in order to demonstrate quantum teleportation . the vacuum contribution in eq .",
    "( [ rhoout ] ) arises from the fact that victor can not distinguish between one or several photons entering his detector , i.e. , victor s inability to properly prepare a single - photon state .",
    "as pointed out by braunstein and kimble @xcite , the fidelity of the innsbruck experiment remains well below the lower bound of 3/4 due to the vacuum contribution ( the exact value of @xmath66 will be calculated in the next section ) .",
    "replying to this , bouwmeester _",
    "et al_.  @xcite argued that ` when a photon appears , it has all the properties required by the teleportation protocol ' . the vacuum contribution in eq .",
    "( [ rhoout ] ) should therefore only affect the efficiency of the experiment , with a consequently high fidelity .",
    "however , this is a potentially ambiguous statement .",
    "if by ` appear ' we mean ` appearing in a photo - detector ' , we agree that a high fidelity ( and low efficiency ) can be inferred .",
    "however , this yields a so - called _ post - selected _ fidelity , where the detection destroys the teleported state .",
    "the fidelity prior to ( or without ) bob s detection is called the _ non_-post - selected fidelity .",
    "the question is now whether we can say that a photon appears when _ no _ detection is made , thus yielding a high _ non_-post - selected fidelity .",
    "this turns out not to be the case .",
    "making an _",
    "ontological _ distinction between a photon and _ no _ photon in a mixed state ( without a detection ) is based on what we call the ` partition ensemble fallacy . '",
    "we now study this in more detail .",
    "consider the state @xmath74 of the form of eq .",
    "( [ rhoout ] ) .",
    "to lowest order , it is the sum of two pure states .",
    "however , this is not a unique ` partition ' . whereas in a chemical mixture of , say ,",
    "nitrogen and oxygen there is a unique partition ( into n@xmath75 and o@xmath75 ) , a quantum mixture can be decomposed many ways .",
    "for instance , @xmath74 can equally be written in terms of @xmath76 as @xmath77 in fact , this is just one of an infinite number of possible decompositions .",
    "quantum mechanics dictates that all partitions are equivalent to each other @xcite .",
    "they are indistinguishable . to elevate one partition over another is to commit the ` partition ensemble fallacy . '",
    "returning to the innsbruck experiment , we observe that in the absence of bob s detection , the density matrix of the teleported state ( i.e. , the _ non_-post - selected state ) may be decomposed into an infinite number of partitions .",
    "these partitions do not necessarily include the vacuum state at all , as exemplified in eq .",
    "( [ novacuum ] ) .",
    "it would therefore be incorrect to say that teleportation did or did not occur except through some operational means ( e.g. , a detection performed by bob ) .",
    "bob s detection thus leads to a high post - selected fidelity . however , the vacuum term in eq .",
    "( [ rhoout ] ) contributes to the _ non_-post - selected fidelity , decreasing it well below the lower bound of 3/4 ( see the next section ) . due to this vacuum contribution , the innsbruck experiment did _ not _ demonstrate _ non_-post - selected quantum teleportation .",
    "nonetheless , teleportation was demonstrated using post - selected data obtained by detecting the teleported state . by selecting events where a photon was observed in the teleported state , a post - selected fidelity higher than @xmath78",
    "could be inferred ( estimated at roughly 80% @xcite ) .",
    "[ we recall that this entire discussion is restricted to the subset of events where successful bell - state and state - preparation have occurred . ]",
    "in this section we present a generalised scheme for the innsbruck experiment which enables us to establish the requirements to obtain non - post - selected quantum teleportation ( based on a three - fold coincidence of victor and alice s detectors ) .",
    "the generalisation consists of a detector cascade @xcite for victor s state - preparation detection and parametric down - converters with different specifications , rather than two identical down - converters .",
    "we consider a detector cascade since single - photon detectors currently require roughly @xmath0k operating conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an arbitrary polarisation rotation in the state - preparation mode allows us to consider any superposition of @xmath7- and @xmath8-polarisation .",
    "first , we give an expression for detectors with a finite efficiency .",
    "then we calculate the output state and give an expression for the teleportation fidelity in terms of the detector efficiencies and down - converter probabilities .",
    "there are two sources of errors for a detector : it might fail to detect a photon , or it might give a signal although there was nt actually a photon present .",
    "the former is called a ` detector loss ' and the latter a ` dark count ' .",
    "dark counts are negligible in the teleportation experiment because the uv - pump is fired during very short time intervals and the probability of finding a dark count in such a small interval is negligible .",
    "consequently , the model for real , finite - efficiency detectors we adopt here only takes into account detector losses .",
    "furthermore , the detectors can not distinguish between one or several photons .    to simulate a realistic detector",
    "we make use of projection operator valued measures , or povm s for short @xcite .",
    "consider a beam - splitter in the mode which is to be detected so that part of the signal is reflected ( see figure [ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "the second incoming mode of the beam - splitter is the vacuum ( we neglect higher photon number states because they hardly contribute at room temperature ) .",
    "the transmitted signal @xmath46 is sent into an ideal detector .",
    "we identify mode @xmath79 with the detector loss .",
    "suppose in mode @xmath3 there are @xmath2 @xmath7-polarised and @xmath80 @xmath8-polarised photons .",
    "furthermore , let these photons all be reflected by the beam - splitter ( since the detectors can not distinguish between one or more photons , we do not consider the case where only some of the photons are reflected ; we are interested in a ` click ' in the detector and partially reflected modes still give a click ) .",
    "the projector for finding these photons in the @xmath79-mode is given by : @xmath81 the beam - splitter equations are taken to be ( @xmath82 ) : @xmath83 substituting these equations in ( [ povmnm ] ) , summing over all @xmath2 and @xmath80 and using the binomial expansion yields    ' '' ''    @xmath84    since the @xmath4-mode is the vacuum , the only contributing term is @xmath85 .",
    "so the povm @xmath86 of finding _ no _ detector counts in mode @xmath3 is @xmath87 the required povm for finding a detector count is @xmath88 |n , m\\rangle_{a_x a_y } \\langle n , m| \\ ; , \\ ] ]    ' '' ''    2 where @xmath89 is the unity operator , @xmath90 is the detector efficiency and @xmath91 the detector loss .",
    "when we let @xmath92 act on the total state and trace out mode @xmath3 , we have inefficiently detected this mode .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this model only applies for short periods of detection . in the case of continuous detection",
    "we need a more elaborate model ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order for victor to distinguish between one or more photons in the state preparation mode @xmath3",
    ", we consider a detector cascade ( victor does nt have a detector which can distinguish between one or several photons coming in ) .",
    "when there is a detector coincidence in the cascade , more than one photon was present in mode @xmath3 , and the event should be dismissed . in the case of ideal detectors",
    ", this will improve the fidelity of the teleportation up to an arbitrary level ( we assume there are no beam - splitter losses ) .",
    "since we employ the cascade in the @xmath3-mode ( which was used by victor to project mode @xmath4 onto a superposition in the polarisation basis ) we need to perform a _ polarisation sensitive _ detection .    in order to model this we separate the incoming state @xmath93 of mode @xmath3 into two spatially separated modes @xmath94 and @xmath95 by means of a polarisation beam - splitter ( see figure [ fig : cascade ] ) .",
    "the modes @xmath96 and @xmath97 will now be detected .",

    "we choose to detect the @xmath7-polarised mode .",
    "this means that we only have to make sure that there are no photons in the @xmath8-mode .",
    "the output state will include a product of the two povm s : one for finding a photon in mode @xmath96 , and one for finding _ no _ photons in mode @xmath97 : @xmath100 .",

    "since we can detect a photon in either one of the modes , we have to include the sum of the corresponding povm s , yielding a transformation @xmath101 .",
    "this is easily expandable to larger cascades by using more beam - splitters and summing over all possible detector hits .      in this section",
    "we incorporate the finite - efficiency detectors and the detector cascade in our calculation of the undetected teleported output state .",

    "the detector efficiency @xmath148 in the innsbruck experiment was 10% @xcite , and the fidelity without detecting the outgoing mode therefore would have been @xmath149 ( conditioned only on successful bell detection and state - preparation ) .",
    "this clearly exemplifies the need for bob s detection .",
    "braunstein and kimble @xcite predicted a theoretical maximum of 50% for the teleportation fidelity , which was conditioned upon ( perfect ) detection of both the @xmath96- and the @xmath97-mode .    rather than improving the detector efficiencies and using a detector cascade , eq .",
    "( [ 2oinns ] ) can be satisfied by adjusting the probabilities @xmath123 and @xmath124 of creating entangled photon - pairs @xcite . from eq .",

    "bearing in mind that @xmath11 is proportional to the pump amplitude , the equation @xmath151 [ see the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ eprdist2 ] ) with @xmath152 gives a relation between the pump amplitude and the probability of creating a photon - pair .",
    "in particular when @xmath153 : @xmath154 decreasing the production rate of one photon - pair source will increase the time needed to run the experiment . in particular , we have from eq .",
    "( [ actual ] ) that @xmath155 with @xmath156 , we obtain @xmath157 . using eq .",
    "( [ speed ] ) we estimate that diminishing the probability @xmath123 by a factor 8.7 will increase the running time by that same factor ( i.e. , running the experiment about nine days , rather than twenty four hours ) .",

    "2 we have explicitly extracted the state which is to be teleported ( @xmath160 ) from the density matrix contribution @xmath161 ( this is not _ necessarily _ the decomposition with the largest @xmath160 contribution ) . as expected , this term is less important in the third order than it is in the second . in the appendix",
    "it is shown that the @xmath2-photon contribution to the outgoing density matrix is always proportional to @xmath162 .    the teleportation fidelity including the third - order contribution ( [ 3oinns ] )",
    "can be derived along the same lines as ( [ 2oinns ] ) .",
    "assuming that all detectors have the same efficiency @xmath90 and @xmath163 , the teleportation fidelity up to third order is @xmath164 with @xmath165 and a detector efficiency of @xmath166 , this fidelity differs from ( [ 2oinns ] ) with only a few parts in ten thousand : @xmath167    on the other hand , let us compare two experiments in which the cascades have different detector efficiencies ( but all the detectors in one cascade still have the same efficiency ) .",
    "the ratio between the teleportation fidelity with detector efficiencies @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( with @xmath168 and @xmath169 the lower and higher detector efficiencies respectively ) up to lowest order is @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the difference between these efficiencies .",
    "this shows that detector efficiencies have a considerably larger influence on the teleportation fidelity than the higher - order pair production .    to summarise our results",
    ", we have found that detector cascading is only useful when the detectors in the cascade have near unit efficiency . in particular , there is a lower bound to the efficiency below which an increase in the number of detectors in the cascade actually decreases the ability to distinguish between one or several photons entering the cascade .",
    "finally , enhancement of the photon - pair source responsible for the entanglement channel relative to the one responsible for the state preparation increases the time needed to run the experiment by an order of magnitude .",
    "we studied the experimental realisation of quantum teleportation as performed in the innsbruck experiment @xcite including possible improvements suggested by braunstein and kimble to achieve a high non - post - selected fidelity @xcite .",
    "the creation of entangled photon - pairs using parametric down - conversion was analysed and we presented a discussion about the teleportation fidelity .",
    "finally , we determined the usefulness of detector cascading and the slow - down of one down - converter relative to the other for the generalised experiment .",
    "the difficulties of the innsbruck experiment can be traced to the state - preparation ( i.e. , to the sources of the entangled photon - pairs , see figure [ model ] ) . in particular , there is a probability that the source responsible for creating entangled photon - pairs produces two pairs simultaneously .",
    "we studied these sources in some detail and have found that _ photon - pairs created in a parametric down - converter are not independent of each other_. employing two parametric down - converters therefore automatically probes the non - poissonian structure of these sources .",
    "the teleported _ state _ in the innsbruck experiment is a mixture of the vacuum and a single - photon state .",
    "however , we can not interpret this state as a low - efficiency teleported state , where sometimes a photon emerges from the apparatus and sometimes not .",
    "this reasoning is based on a particular partition of the outgoing density matrix , and this is not consistent with quantum mechanics ( to our knowledge , this is the first instance where pef leads to a different evaluation of an experiment ) . in section [ whatisqt ]",
    "we showed how a high fidelity in the innsbruck experiment could only be interpreted in a post - selected manner .",
    "the interpretation of what quantum teleportation is , gives rise to different evaluations of the innsbruck experiment .",
    "when one holds that the freely propagating output state of quantum teleportation should resemble the input state sufficiently closely ( i.e. , non - post - selected quantum teleportation ) , the non - post - selected teleportation fidelity in the innsbruck experiment should be at least @xmath78 .",
    "this requirement was not met .",
    "nonetheless the innsbruck experiment demonstrated _ post - selected _ quantum teleportation ( i.e. , teleportation conditioned on the detection of the outgoing state ) .    in the generalised version of the innsbruck experiment ( _  la _ braunstein and kimble ) we have modelled a detector cascade in the state - preparation mode .",
    "however , for the cascade to work , the detectors need to have near unit efficiency",
    ". in particular , for infinite cascading the efficiency of the detectors should be at least ninety percent .",
    "finite cascading requires even higher detector efficiencies .",
    "this places a severe limitation on the practical use of detector cascades in this situation .",
    "detector losses in the cascade have an immediate influence on the teleportation fidelity , yielding an effect which is much stronger than the higher order corrections due to multiple - pair creation ( three pairs or more ) of the down - converters .    if the stability of the experimental setup can be maintained for a longer time ( the order of weeks ) , it is possible to slow down the down - converter responsible for creating the unknown input state .",
    "this can improve the fidelity up to arbitrary level .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that our analysis demonstrates the definite benefits of single - photon detectors for such experiments or applications in the future .",
    "this technology currently requires roughly @xmath0k operating conditions .",
    "this research is funded in part by epsrc grant gr / l91344 .",
    "in this appendix we show that all the cross - terms of the density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) must vanish .",
    "the density matrix consists of several distinct parts : a vacuum contribution , a contribution due to one photon in mode @xmath79 , two photons , and so on .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 photon - pairs created in the whole system , and @xmath80 photon - pairs out of @xmath2 are produced by the second source ( modes @xmath46 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "the outgoing mode must then contain @xmath80 photons . reversing this argument",
    ", when we find @xmath80 photons in the outgoing mode the probability of creating this particular contribution must be proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "expanding the @xmath2-th order output state into parts of definite photon number we can write @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the ( unnormalised ) @xmath2-th order contribution containing all terms with @xmath80 photons",
    ".    an immediate corollary of this argument is that all the cross - terms between different photon number states in the density matrix must vanish .",
    "the cross - terms _ are _ present in eq .",
    "( [ subout ] ) , and we must therefore show that the partial trace in eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) makes them vanish .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 photons in the total system .",
    "a cross - term in the density matrix will have the form @xmath175 with @xmath176 .",
    "we also know that @xmath177 , so that at least one of the other modes must have the cross - term property as well .",
    "suppose @xmath178 is not equal to @xmath179 .",
    "since we have tr@xmath180 = \\delta_{k , k'}$ ] , the cross - terms must vanish .",
