    "<S> the multichannel efimov physics is investigated in ultracold heteronuclear admixtures of k and rb atoms . </S>",

    "<S> efimov states , an infinite series of three - body bound states with discrete scale invariance when a two - body scattering length diverges @xcite , provided us a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of three - body parameter both theoretically and experimentally . combined experimental effort to observe efimov - related resonance provided us with unexpected constancy of three - body parameters@xcite , while detailed theoretical analysis showed the origin of this constancy in some limiting cases@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a newly developed three - body spinor model that included both van der waals interactions and multichannel feshbach physics has succeeded in reproducing many experimentally observed efimov features in homonuclear atomic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model involves additional parameters that characterize feshbach resonances , such as the background scattering length of an open channel normalized by the van der waals length ( @xmath5 ) and the resonance strength of a closed channel ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was impressive to see that predictions from a three - body model constructed to reproduce only two - body feshbach physics match almost perfectly with the experimentally observed three - body features in homonuclear systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this achievement suggests that the necessity of including precise few - body short - range chemical forces in studies of universal few - body phenomena  a task far beyond our current capability  may be removed .    </S>",
    "<S> extending this universal theory to _ hetero_nuclear systems is the next big challenge . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the mass ratio , heteronuclear systems have the extra complication of having both inter- and intra - species scattering lengths . near broad feshbach resonances ( @xmath7 ) , the single - channel universal van der waals theory  @xcite predicted a universal dependence of the three - body parameter on the intra - species scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions have been confirmed to hold in @xmath8li-@xmath9cs @xcite and @xmath10li-@xmath1rb @xcite mixtures , where the feshbach resonances with intermediate widths have @xmath11 even down to unity  @xcite . for homonuclear systems , </S>",

    "<S> the effect of the finite feshbach resonance width , as well as of the structure of the complicated resonance structure more commonly seen in realistic atomic systems , has therefore not been well demonstrated and understood . moreover , the recent experimental confirmations of the universal van der waals theory are for the systems with large mass ratios ( two heavy and one light atoms )  the so - called `` efimov - favored '' systems , where the mechanism of the universality of the three - body parameter is considered to be different from the mechanism in the systems with small or moderate mass ratios  @xcite  the `` efimov - unfavored '' systems . </S>",
    "<S> an independent investigation is therefore still needed for the latter systems .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we show the role of multichannel feshbach physics in determining the three - body parameter in the `` efimov - unfavored '' systems of k - rb admixtures . </S>",
    "<S> our three - body spinor theory successfully reproduces the difference in the positions of the efimov - like atom - dimer resonance observed in our @xmath0k-@xmath1rb experiment and the previous jila @xmath2k-@xmath1rb experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the feshbach resonances involved in the isotopic systems include both isolated and overlapping resonances , our study also demonstrates that efimov resonance features in atomic systems can be fully described by three - body van der waals models that reproduce the relevant two - body feshbach spectra .    in previous experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the three - body parameter was mostly determined by the positions of the efimov resonances in three - body recombination . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is feasible in studies of the `` efimov - favored '' heteronuclear systems , thanks to the increased universal scaling constant @xmath14 and therefore , the significantly decreased efimov scaling cycle @xmath15  @xcite for the ground efimov resonance to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> for an `` efimov - unfavored '' system such as rb - rb - k , the size of scattering length needed for seeing an efimov resonance in three - body recombination is too large to be realized experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore measure the positions of the efimov - like atom - dimer resonances instead , which could be observed at significantly lower scattering length  @xcite . for a comprehensive analysis of the heteronuclear efimov resonance </S>",
    "<S> , we also investigate the three - body loss in @xmath0k-@xmath1rb admixtures on the negative side of the feshbach resonance . as will be shown in our later discussion , </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a resonance in three - body recombination in our measurements is consistent with the universal predictions  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> two krb systems are nearly identical in the single channel theory : the van der waals length ( @xmath16 ) are 71.9 @xmath17 and 72.2 @xmath17 @xcite , and the scaling parameters @xmath14 for two rb atoms and one k atom are 0.6444 and 0.6536 , for @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixture and @xmath2k-@xmath1rb mixture , respectively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are different in the multi - channel theory : the mixture of @xmath0k atoms and @xmath1rb atoms both in the lowest hyperfine state have one broad resonance at 39.4 g and one intermediate resonance at 78.82 g. special treatment is needed for describing these overlapping feshbach resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture of @xmath2k atoms and @xmath1rb atoms both in the lowest hyperfine state have one intermediate resonance at 546.9 g. this resonance is well isolated from other feshbach resonances and thus it can be simply described by the combination of @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath19)@xcite . the purpose of comparing these two krb systems is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , if these two systems show identical efimov structures , it is very likely that a single - channel theory can adequately explain the three - body physics in heteronuclear systems ; conversely , if the results do not match , it should be investigated whether the difference can be reproduced by using the multichannel van der waals theory introduced in the homonuclear case .    </S>",
