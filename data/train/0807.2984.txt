    "recent years have seen the emergence of first results for loop corrections to massive @xmath0 scattering processes  @xcite .",

    ", a linear relation must exist between the loop momentum and the external momenta of a pentagon integral .",
    "similarly , if the external momenta of a hexagon are 4-dimensional , they must be linearly dependent .",
    "this enables one to reduce hexagons to pentagons , and pentagons to boxes  @xcite .",
    "these considerations have been extended to dimensionally regularized one - loop tensor integrals  @xcite .",
    "generally , in the reduction of tensor integrals one encounters inverse gram determinants , which can vanish at exceptional phase space points and be a source of instabilities in a numerical program . in the case of 4-dimensional pentagons , it is possible to avoid the leading inverse gram determinant  @xcite .",
