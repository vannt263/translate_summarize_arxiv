    "the particle spectrum is a basic quantity measured in experiments and it can reveal the information of particle production mechanism in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recently , the tsallis distribution has attracted many theorists and experimentalists attention in high energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the excellent ability to fit the spectra of identified hadrons and charged particles in a large range of @xmath0 up to 200 gev is quite impressive @xcite . from the phenomenological view",
    ", there may be real physics behind the prominent phenomenology work , e.g. regge trajectory for particle classification @xcite .",
    "p+p collision experiments have been performed and measured under different energies .",
    "since p+p collision is very simple compared to nucleus - nucleus collision , the measurements of p+p collisions are used to understand the particle interaction , particle production mechanism and as a baseline for nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "many efforts have been put to study the particle spectra produced in p+p collisions using tsallis distribution .",
    "different versions of the tsallis distribution are used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 in the tsallis distribution was interpreted as temperature .",
    "all of them can fit the particle spectra very well but they give different temperatures . in this work , we would like to study the connections and differences among different versions of the tsallis distribution .",
    "we collected p+p collisions data with different @xmath0 ranges and different rapidity cuts from different experiment groups at rhic and lhc and did a systematic study of the particle spectra using one of the tsallis distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , we review different versions of the tsallis distribution used in the literature and analyze their connections and differences",
    ". we also give the form of tsallis distribution used in our anlysis . in section iii",

    "the star @xcite , phenix @xcite collaborations at rhic and alice @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at lhc adopted the form of tsallis distribution @xmath3}(1+\\frac{m_t - m}{nc})^{-n } , \\label{exptsallis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the transverse mass .",
    "@xmath5 was used as a fitting parameter in ref .",

    "this result is well known because high energy particles come from hard scattering and they follow a power law distribution with @xmath0 .",

    "( [ exptsallis ] ) , but there are some differences , i.e. @xmath22 replaces @xmath23 in the bracket and there is a term @xmath22 in front of the bracket as well .",
    "we have seen that two kinds of representation have been used : one is with parameter @xmath2 , i.e. eq .",
    "( [ exptsallis ] ) and the other is with parameter @xmath18 , i.e. eq . ( [ tsallisbr ] ) .",
    "there is no direct match between @xmath2 and @xmath18 because eqs .",
    "( [ exptsallis ] , [ tsallisbr ] ) are just similar .",
    "we find a connection between @xmath2 and @xmath18 in the limit at large @xmath0 .    when @xmath8 , from eq .",
    "( [ tsallisbr ] ) , we can obtain @xmath24 recalling that @xmath25 when @xmath8 from eq .",

    "[ sec:1 ]    we can rewrite eq . ( [ tsalliswongdndp ] ) into @xmath41 from the experimental measurements , we know that @xmath42 is almost a constant when @xmath43 is not large @xcite .",

    "this form of tsallis distribution was derived without resorting to thermodynamical description , which is different from eq .",

    "( [ tsallisb ] ) . eq .",
    "( [ tsallisus ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ exptsallis ] ) but in a simpler form .",

    "we will show that the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ tsallisus ] ) does nt change the results from eq .",
    "( [ tsalliswong ] ) later in this paper .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( [ tsallisus ] ) has been used by cms collaboration @xcite and by wong _",
    "_ in their recent paper @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration also applied a formula which is very close to eq .",

    "[ fitt ] , we show the parameter @xmath1 of the tsallis distribution obtained by fitting spectra of particles at different @xmath47 in p+p collisions .",
    "firstly , we can see that the parameter @xmath1 depends on the fitting @xmath0 range .",
    "only the results for high @xmath0 particles ( black stars ) are very much different from the ones including all the @xmath0 particles at @xmath48 gev .",
    "secondly , @xmath1 are almost the same for a particle and its anti - particle as it should be .",
    "thirdly , @xmath1 for pions produced at different collision energy @xmath47 is almost a constant around 0.13 gev .",
    "this is consistent with the results in a similar study for charged particles in p+p collisions @xcite and p+pb collsions at @xmath49 tev @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the pion production mechanism is similar in p+p and p+pb collisions .",
    "@xmath1 for kaons is a little bit smaller than the one for protons at the same collision energy @xmath47 .",
    "but they have similar behaviors and increase with @xmath47 .",
    "we can interpret the results in the framework of a cascade particle production mechanism .",
    "since the kaons and protons are heavier than pions , they are more likely to be produced at the beginning while pions can be produced at all times . then their temperatures are higher than pions .",
    "when we include the results of the @xmath43 meson @xcite and the multi - strange baryons @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite produced at @xmath52 gev together , the trend is obvious .",
    "@xmath1 is higher when the mass of the particle is heavier which is consistent with the cascade particle production mechanism .",
    "similar behaviors have been observed in p+pb collisions as well @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath1 for the identified hadrons depends on the tsallis distribution form used in the fitting process . as we mentioned before",
    ", some authors argue that the identified hadrons should have the same @xmath1 @xcite ; others suggest otherwise @xcite .",
    "therefore we only can compare the results of pions from different versions of the tsallis distribution . in this case",
    ", we also can put the results of charged particles from different versions of the tsallis distribution in since @xmath1 for charged particles is very similar to pions s as showed in the previous discussion .",
    "we categorize eqs .",
    "( [ exptsallis ] , [ tsalliswong ] , [ tsallisus ] ) as type - a , eqs .",
    "( [ tsallisb ] , [ tsallisbr ] ) as type - b and eqs .",
    "( [ senaeq ] , [ tsallislong ] ) as type - c tsallis distribution to clarify the discussion .",
    "type - a tsallis distribution gives @xmath53 gev for pions and charged particles .",
    "this has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fitt ] ( left panel ) and can be found in refs .",
    "type - b gives @xmath54 gev @xcite .",
    "the extra term @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ tsallisb ] , [ tsallisbr ] ) is responsible for this lower @xmath1 , which is the main difference between type - a and type - b . without it ,",
    "type - b will give similar @xmath1 as type - a .",
    "type - c gives @xmath55 gev @xcite .",
    "another type of tsallis distribution , see equation ( 7 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , gives @xmath56 gev .    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can connect the parameter @xmath2 in the power law of particle spectra at high @xmath0 with the particle production process .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . here",
    "we just briefly state the results .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of active participants in the point like scattering .",
    "@xmath58 includes all the consituents of initial and final states in the scattering .",
    "if we assume that the basic scattering process at high @xmath0 is @xmath59 , we have 2 constituents for initial and final states respectively , then @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we can obtain higher values of @xmath2 from the scattering at the hadron level , i.e. @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 which is the upper limit for @xmath2 for pions and kaons .",
    "for proton , @xmath2 can go higher up to 20 in the scattering process @xmath65 .",
    "this also sets the limits for the parameter @xmath18 in the tsallis distribution . using eq .",
    "( [ nq ] ) , we obtain @xmath66 $ ] for mesons and @xmath67 $ ] for protons .",
    "the fitting results of @xmath18 are between the limits in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fitn ] , we show the parameter @xmath2 obtained by fitting the spectra of particles with tsallis distribution at different @xmath47 in p+p collisions .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath2 are well between those limits for all particles .",
    "this could give us some hints about the particle production mechanism in p+p collisions .",
    "we notice that the parameters @xmath2 for pions and protons are decreasing with the collision energy which indicates that interactions are from hadron level to quark level .",
    "this picture is quite clear we can break the hadrons into quarks at higher collision energy .",
    "but if we look at the results from kaons , the @xmath2 dereases first and then increases .",
    "such a feature is not clear .    0.7    [ fitpara ]",
    "we have made a thorough study of traverse momentum spectra of identified particles produced in p+p collisions at rhic and lhc energies with tsallis distribution .",
    "a detailed analysis of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 is also shown .",
    "@xmath1 is not dependent on the beam energy for pions , while for kaons and protons it increases with increasing energy .",
    "furthermore , we notice that @xmath1 is higher for the particle whose mass is larger .",
    "this is probably due to the particle produced time . in the cascade particle production mechanism , this result is perfectly understandable .",
    "the behavior of @xmath2 for kaons is not the same as pions and protons , which is related to the particle production process . from the properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
