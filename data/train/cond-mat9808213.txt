    "longer simulations would be needed to relate the depletion of the superfluid fraction induced by the disordered potential to changes of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the rqmc method utilizes the metropolis algorithm to sample an explicitly known probability distribution , namely a discretized path integral expansion of @xmath279 which becomes exact in the limit @xmath215 and @xmath280 . sampling a distribution , as opposed to carrying weights ,",
    "avoids the difficulties associated with fluctuating weights which plague applications of ` pure diffusion ' @xcite or ` single thread ' @xcite monte carlo .",
    "for instance , we were unable to get converged results for our 64 particle system with pdmc .",
    "the idea of sampling a path - integral representation of the imaginary - time evolution to compute ground state properties is not new @xcite .",
    "for instance , variational path integral @xcite ( vpi ) uses the pair product approximation to expand the many  body density matrix @xmath281 and the bisection method to sample the path , just like in the usual path integral monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "rqmc features instead an expansion of the imaginary - time propagator based on the langevin dynamics generated by the trial function , and a reptation algorithm to sample the exponential of the resulting action . from the computational point of view",
    ", the advantage of this particular choice can be understood in the limit of perfect importance sampling : if the trial function is exact the local energy is a constant , and reptation moves consisting of an arbitrary number of time slices will be accepted with probability 1 . eventually , a very poor wave function ( or equivalently a very large number of particles ) will force us to take extremely small reptation moves , and moves of the kind used in vpi will become more efficient @xcite .",
    "vpi has been implemented @xcite for the simulation of superfluid @xmath0he at @xmath276 .",
    "according to the author of the vpi calculation , for the system size considered here rqmc is considerably more efficient .",
    "sampling an explicitly known distribution is to be contrasted to the standard bdmc , which samples an unknown distribution ( _ i.e. _ the mixed distribution @xmath282 ) obtained from the asymptotic solution of a differential equation @xcite .",
    "bdmc is designed to compute efficiently the total energy ; however it introduces a population - control bias , yields a mixed estimate for operators not commuting with @xmath132 , and does not retain direct information on the imaginary - time correlations .",
    "this information can be retrieved through the ` forward walking ' technique @xcite and used to correct both the population control and the mixed estimate biases , but at the price of additional statistical fluctuations .",
    "we believe that rqmc will turn out to be advantageous over bdmc in those cases where recovering information from fluctuating weights becomes too noisy .",
    "the results for the total energy shown in table [ tab : table1 ] are obtained with the rqmc and the bdmc methods using the same time step , number of particles and trial function . from the estimated statistical error",
    "we infer that bdmc is roughly 3 times faster than rqmc for the calculation of the total energy .",
    "also listed in table [ tab : table1 ] are the unbiased estimates for the potential energy . in this case",
    "the bdmc algorithm with forward walking ( implemented in the `` backward storing mode '' described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) turns out to be roughly two times slower than rqmc .",
    "obviously , factors 2 or 3 for a couple of observables in a particular physical system are not a conclusive assessment of the relative performance of two algorithms .",
    "however the resulting factor 6 in the relative improvement of rqmc when bdmc has to be complemented with forward walking suggests that , whenever explicit information on imaginary - time correlations is used , rqmc is likely to be competitive or better .",
    "the most attractive feature of the rqmc method is that it uses the dynamical properties of the random walk in a way that is directly related to the imaginary - time properties of the physical system .",
    "a previous implementations of similar ideas ( pdmc , @xcite ) was based on re - weighting and the scope of its applications was severely restricted by the fluctuations of the weights .",
    "we have shown that , by simply complementing the pdmc method with a re - sampling of the paths based on the value of the action , the resulting rqmc algorithm can afford system sizes typical of current bdmc simulations of continuous strongly interacting systems .",
    "unbiased estimates , static responses and some insight into dynamical properties can be readily obtained .",
    "the dependence of the computational effort on the number of particles and on the quality of the trial function remains to be investigated .",
    "such an analysis will determine whether this method can be useful in more general situations than @xmath0he bulk liquid .",
    "clusters , films and superfluids in restricted geometries are natural candidates for further applications .    for fermion problems one has either to resort to the fixed - node approximation @xcite , or to cope with the sign problem @xcite . in the former case , the dynamical information contained in the path",
    "is incorrect @xcite , but still the explicit knowledge of the weights along the path makes the algorithm free from the mixed distribution and the population control biases ; furthermore it gives easily access to interesting quantities , such as a low  variance estimator of born  oppenheimer forces in electronic systems @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the dynamics is correct , and can be used for example to get information on the ground and excited states from the imaginary - time evolution in the transient regime @xcite ; in similar cases however the real bottleneck will remain the sign problem .",
    "rqmc , vpi @xcite and the technique discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite sample explicit expressions of the imaginary - time propagator with the metropolis algorithm to calculate zero temperature properties .",
    "we believe that these methods are very promising and deserve more attention than they have received so far .",
    "all these methods are based on the metropolis algorithm : they enjoy therefore of a large freedom in the choice of the transition probability @xcite , which is probably not yet fully exploited .",
    "we are indebted with kevin schmidt for useful discussions and for communicating to us unpublished details of his vpi calculations on @xmath0he .",
