    "this is the third and last of a group of papers dealing with the properties of carbon - rich mira variables . in this paper",
    "we combine the photometry and bolometric data of whitelock et al .",
    "( 2006 , paper i ) and the radial velocities listed in menzies et al .",
    "( 2006 , paper ii ) to discuss the kinematics of the c - miras .",
    "a main aim of this paper is to derive estimates of the absolute magnitudes , ages and initial masses of galactic c - miras .",
    "these parameters are of importance both for understanding the place of c - miras in stellar evolution and for using them as probes of the stellar populations in other galaxies . whilst there have been some estimates of the likely mass range of carbon stars in general ( e.g. from studies of their galactic distribution ( claussen et al .",
    "1987 , groenewegen et al .",
    "1995 ) , and considerable theoretical work on the production of carbon stars , there has been little or no observational evidence on the ages and masses of c - miras except for the occurrence of three of them in intermediate age clusters in the magellanic clouds ( nishida et al .",
    "2000 ) and one of somewhat uncertain period in another lmc cluster ( van loon et al . 2003 ) , but see also the discussion on iras044966958 in section 6 .",
    "there has been no evidence as to whether or not ages and initial masses of c - miras vary with period .",
    "as regards the luminosities of galactic c - miras , whitelock & feast ( 2000 ) found that a satisfactory zero - point for the pl(@xmath4 ) relation could not be obtained from hipparcos parallaxes due mainly to the small number with significant weight .",
    "other estimates of c - mira luminosities were discussed in paper i.",
    "the radial velocities used in this analysis are those listed in table 4 of paper ii where they have been corrected to our adopted local standard of rest .",
    "the local solar motion adopted was : @xmath5 ( towards the galactic centre ) , @xmath6 ( in the direction of galactic rotation ) , and @xmath7 ( towards the north galactic pole ) .",
    "these are the values derived by feast & whitelock ( 1997 ) ( see also feast 2000 ) .",
    "+ heliocentric distances were obtained using the period - luminosity relation derived from lmc observations of c - miras in paper i , viz .",
    ", @xmath8 for an assumed lmc distance modulus of 18.50 the constant term in this equation was found to be @xmath9 .",
    "distances using this value were tabulated in paper ii ( their table 4 ) .",
    "one aim of the present analysis is to estimate the value of @xmath10 for the galactic sample .",
    "the standard general relation for differential galactic rotation used in the analysis was + @xmath11 where :    * @xmath12 is the radial velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , * @xmath13 is oort s constant of differential galactic rotation , * @xmath14 is the distance from the sun to the galactic centre , * @xmath15 is the distance of the mira from the galactic axis of rotation ( i.e. cylindrical rotation is assumed ) , * @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the galactic longitude and latitude of the mira , * @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the components of any group motion with respect to the adopted standard of rest and in the same directions as the lsr components given above . * the @xmath4 term tests for possible systematic effects in the radial velocities .",
    "we adopt @xmath21 from eisenhauer et al .",
    "this is the value derived from the motions of objects close to the central black hole .",
    "we also adopt @xmath22 from the analysis of the hipparcos proper motions of galactic cepheids ( feast & whitelock 1997 ) .",
    "we carried out some preliminary calculations including in equation 2 some higher order rotation terms , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the nomenclature of pont et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and using the values obtained for them by these workers from an analysis of cepheid radial velocities .",
    "however , their values were not confirmed in the analysis of cepheid proper motions ( feast & whitelock 1997 ) and may be due to group motions on the kiloparsec scale which are known to occur for young objects .",
    "group motions of cepheids do not necessarily apply to an older population such as the c - miras . furthermore , since we restrict our main discussion to objects having @xmath25 , the effect of the higher order terms is minor .",
    "that differential galactic rotation is clearly present in our sample can be seen from fig .  1 . here",
    "we plot , the mean values of the quantity , @xmath26 $ ] , weighted by @xmath27^{2}$ ] , against @xmath28 for the stars with @xmath29 kpc . for distances we have used equation 1 with @xmath30 from the lmc .",
    "the points have been grouped by @xmath28 so as to obtain approximately equal weights for each point .",
    "the standard errors are shown . for differential galactic rotation we expect a line of slope @xmath31 as is indeed seen . also plotted are grouped values of @xmath12 against @xmath32 which shows that there is no effect of asymmetric drift ( i.e. @xmath33 as shown below ) . note that in this and subsequent work we omit the high velocity c - mira v crb which is discussed in section 5 .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     v crb is the only star which we have omitted from the discussions of the earlier sections .",
    "however , for completeness we list in table 6 the stars which have residuals from the galactic rotation solutions of greater than @xmath34 .",
    "the table is in two sections with stars in the @xmath35 annulus separated from those outside . in view of the velocity dispersions",
    "involved it is not surprising that there are a few stars with relatively large residuals , and outside the annulus there may well be significant deviations from the model adopted .",
    "it is however somewhat intriguing that in the table there are four stars in the general direction of the galactic anticentre and one in the general direction of the galactic centre where the effects of the model are less significant .",
    "these stars ( zz gem , az aur , iras06088 + 1909 , rt gem , iras 172222328 ) all have a large radial component outwards from the galactic centre",
    ". it would be interesting to study their space motions and to see whether this is anything more than a statistical chance effect .",
    "a somewhat more complex outward motion was found for short period o - miras ( feast & whitelock 2000a , feast 2003a ) which was attributed to a bar - like motion .",
    "it should however be noted that the kinematics show that the short period o - miras and the c - miras discussed in this paper belong to quite different populations .",
    "in section 2 we found that if we assume the c - miras follow a period , absolute bolometric magnitude relation of the same slope as for the c - miras in the lmc , then the zero - point of this relation is , within the uncertainties , the same in the galaxy as in the lmc despite possible differences in metallicities .",
    "this is a useful result since it suggests that c - miras may be used with some confidence as distance indicators in populations of different metallicity .",
    "this is of importance for extragalactic applications . it may well be that in some applications ( e.g. extragalactic work ) , it will be necessary to derive the apparent bolometric magnitudes from near infrared observations alone . in that case the bolometric corrections derived in paper i should be valuable .",
    "our kinematic results indicate that the c - miras , at least in the period ranges we cover , come from a rather restricted range of ages and initial masses .",
    "the low mean initial masses and intermediate ages we find are in agreement with those estimated for the magellanic cloud clusters containing c - miras .",
    "they are also in agreement with the results of kahane et al .",
    "these authors compared isotope abundances in the c - mira cw leo ( irc+10216 ) with theoretical predictions and found that for solar metallicities their @xmath36 model disagreed with the observations but that models with masses less than about @xmath37 were satisfactory .",
    "considerably higher initial masses have sometimes been suggested at least for the longer period c - miras .",
    "bergeat et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest @xmath38 , whilst raimondo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that the bulk of the long period variables ( in which they include non - miras ) in the smc are of age @xmath39 to @xmath40 gyr , much younger than our estimated ages for c - miras .",
    "raimondo et al . suggest that the smc variables were formed in a burst of star formation believed to have taken place at about that time ( harris & zaritsky 2004 ) .",
    "our mean age , @xmath41 ( or the somewhat larger value suggested by the pietrinferni et al .",
    "models ) , if it applies to the smc c - miras , would not be consistent with them being formed in such a burst .",
    "they would in fact be nearer in age to the burst that harris & zaritsky date at 2.5 gyr ago .",
    "it should be noted that whilst the @xmath42 diagram of raimondo et al .",
    "( 2005)(their fig .",
    "8) shows the wood  c \" sequence ( on which the c - miras lie ) in broad agreement with the pl(@xmath4 ) relation of feast et al .",
    "( 1989 ) shifted to the smc distance , though much broader due to their dependence on single near ir observations , their @xmath43 diagram ( their fig .",
    "15 ) has a wood  c \" sequence which is much steeper , and displaced from our pl(@xmath44 ) relation .",
    "this may be connected with the bolometric corrections for carbon stars that they adopt from bergeat et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "our results , considered together with those on the c - miras in magellanic cloud clusters , suggest that the c - miras should provide a mean age for a population in which they occur ( say in an extragalactic system ) .",
    "in addition the suggestion in our data that initial mass and age are a function of the period of these stars , at least at the shorter periods , indicates that a comparison of the distribution of c - mira periods in different stellar systems will enable a comparative study of star formation in the interval @xmath45 to @xmath46 gyr ago .    * the analysis of radial velocities and photometry in this paper is based on the assumption that the bulk of galactic carbon miras lie on a pl relation as do those in the lmc , including the ones in lmc clusters discussed above .",
    "lmc work ( e.g. whitelock et al . 2003 ) also shows that there are a small number of large amplitude agb variables which lie above the pl relation . providing such stars are also rare in our galaxy they should not significantly affect any of our conclusions . it has been suggested ( whitelock & feast 2000 , whitelock et al . 2003 ) that these rare overluminous stars are undergoing hot bottom burning ( hbb ) - although this is controversial in the case of c - rich stars as hbb is expected to convert the carbon to nitrogen .",
    "theory ( e.g. sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) then suggests that these stars probably have masses in excess of 4@xmath47 , significantly greater than those of normal miras in the same period range .",
    "it is therefore of interest that one such star discussed by whitelock et al . ,",
    "iras044966958 , is possibly a member of the small cluster hs33 .",
    "van loon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained a colour - magnitude diagram of this cluster .",
    "whilst separation of the cluster from the field stars is difficult they suggest an age in the range 110 to 200 myr and hence a relatively massive progenitor for iras044966958 in qualitative agreement with hbb predictions .",
    "*    there is a suggestion from the velocity dispersions that at a given period the c - miras are younger than the o - miras .",
    "the period - luminosity relation for c - miras ( whitelock et al .",
    "2005 ) and that for o - miras ( feast et al .",
    "1989 ) suggest that also , at a given period , the c - miras are fainter bolometrically than the o - miras , although the thin - shelled members of these two classes obey the same pl(@xmath4 ) relation .",
    "caution is required in interpreting this since the spectral energy distribution is different in the two types of miras and may lead to different systematic errors in deriving the bolometric magnitudes .",
    "for instance thin - shelled o - miras whose energy distributions peak in the near infrared may have estimated bolometric magnitudes which are one or two tenths of a magnitude too bright because the @xmath48 filters avoid the main stellar water absorption bands ( robertson & feast 1981 ) . whilst accurate bolometric magnitudes are needed for comparison with theoretical predictions , possible systematic errors of this type",
    "are not important in using miras as distance indicators as long as the bolometric luminosities are calculated in a consistent manner .",
    "if despite the above caveat , there is a real difference in the bolometric luminosities of o- and c - miras of the same age , this would be difficult to understand unless , for instance , the two groups had different overall metallicities . in that case , objects in one group ( presumably that of lower metallicity ) may have become carbon stars before , or immediately on , entering the mira stage .",
    "the work of abia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discussed at the end of our section 4 , nevertheless , suggests that carbon stars in the local galactic disc have metallicities close to that of the disc mean , though a fuller understanding of the metallicities of disc o- and c - miras is very desirable .",
    "it is striking that in the work on obscured miras in the magellanic clouds ( whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) there are no c - miras with periods greater than 1000 days .",
    "the longest period c - mira in our galactic sample is 815 days and there is an object with a possible period of 1060 days in the sample of c - miras discussed by groenewegen et al .",
    "however , the details of this star have not , so far as we know , been published .",
    "we have therefore not included it in the present discussion . on the other hand the lmc sample of whitelock et al .",
    "contains a group of o - miras with periods in the range 1097 to 1393 days . the absence of such long period o - miras in the galactic bulge , except in the central region ( glass et al .",
    "1995 , wood et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggests that they are too young to be there",
    ". they may well be younger than the longest period c - mira . if that is the case they may be relatively massive objects which have been prevented from becoming c - miras by hot bottom burning ( boothroyd et al . 1993 ) .",
