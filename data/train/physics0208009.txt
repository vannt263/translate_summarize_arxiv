    "all spectra , representing projections of the same density , must be interdependent .",
    "this so - called consistency condition ( _ cc _ ) has been considered for reconstructing densities @xmath0 from their line projections [ 1 - 3 ] . in the case of angular correlation of annihilation radiation ( @xmath1 ) spectra or compton profiles",
    "( _ cp _ ) measurements this condition is satisfied if spectra are measured up to such a momentum @xmath2 above which @xmath0 is isotropic and all projections have the same values .",
    "the _ cc _ is automatically imposed on the experimental data via the reconstruction of @xmath0 .",
    "however , it can be utilised for checking ( before the reconstruction ) if data were measured and next corrected ( to remove various experimental imperfections ) properly .",
    "moreover , this condition can be also profitable for an _ improvement _ of such experimental data for which @xmath0 is not reconstructed . for",
    "this purpose one should estimate interdependences between projections what is a subject of this paper .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the consistency condition in its general form , i.e. for the radon transform in _ n_-dimensional space .",
    "next , some relations between line ( sec .",
    "ii.a ) and plane projections ( sec .",
    "ii.b ) are derived from both the _ cc _ and a symmetry of @xmath0 ( electronic densisty in the momentum space ) for various crystallographical structures .",
    "a fulfilment of these relations , proved for various model and experimental spectra , is discussed in sec .",
    "the radon transform [ 4 ] represents integrals of @xmath0 ( defined in @xmath3-dimensional space , @xmath4 ) over @xmath5-dimensional hyperplanes : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a unit vector in @xmath4 along @xmath8 and @xmath8 is a perpendicular distance of the hyperplane from the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the equation @xmath9 defines the hyperplane . in the same coordinate system",
    "the vector @xmath10 is described by @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( e.g. dean [ 5 ] ) .",
    "both functions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , can be expanded into spherical harmonics of degree @xmath15 : @xmath16 @xmath17 where index @xmath18 distinguishes harmonics of the same order @xmath15 . in order to make our formuale clearer ,",
    "henceforth index @xmath18 will be omitted , keeping in mind that for the same @xmath15 a few harmonics can be used . according to dean [ 5 ] ,    @xmath19^{\\mu-1/2}dt,\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 denotes the @xmath22 derivative of @xmath13 ; @xmath23 are gegenbauer polynomials and @xmath24 .",
    "the equation ( 4 ) can be solved analitically if either [ 6 ] @xmath25 with @xmath26 , or [ 7 ] @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the hermite polynomials . because in @xmath29 all terms @xmath30 with @xmath31 are equal to zero ,",
    "the lowest term in @xmath32 is of order @xmath15 .",
    "this property , called _ cc _ , follows from the fact that functions @xmath32 ( eq . ( 2 ) ) are a linear combination of @xmath33 which in turn are interdependent being projections of the same density .",
    "generally , one can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes an arbitrary orthogonal polynomial . below , considering the cases @xmath36 ( line projections ) and @xmath37 ( plane projections ) , we show that due to this property of @xmath38 ( its minimal number of zeros ) we can get some interdependences between projections @xmath33 . for",
    "that it is necessary to expand them into a series of the same ( as in eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) polynomials : @xmath39 by combining eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) we can obtain some relations between @xmath40 as a function of @xmath7 . in the paper , for calculating the coefficients @xmath41 , the chebyshev polynomials and",
    "the gaussian quadrature formulae were applied .      in the case of reconstructing @xmath0 from its line projections @xmath42 ( measured in the apparatus systems @xmath43 ) , the reconstruction of the three  dimensional ( @xmath44 ) density can be reduced to a set of reconstructions of @xmath45 densities ( the radon transform for @xmath36 ) performed , independently , on succeeding planes @xmath46 , parallel each other . in order to describe all projections in the same coordinate system ( in which the symmetry of both @xmath0 and measured spectra is defined )",
    "the function @xmath13 can be characterized in the polar system where @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath48 denote the distance of the integration line from the origin of the coordinate system and its angle with respect to a chosen axis , respectively .",
    "for the planes @xmath46 , perpendicular to the axis of the crystal rotation of the order @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( 2 ) reduces to the @xmath50 series [ 8 ] : @xmath51    with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 , @xmath49 , @xmath54 , _ etc . _ ) . here",
    "the angle @xmath48 , describing nonequivalent directions , is changing between @xmath55 .",
    "of course , to use the symmetry most profitably , a sensible choice is to select the planes perpendicular to the main axis of the crystal rotation ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 for cubic and tetragonal or hexagonal structures , respectively ) where @xmath58 is minimal , i.e. the number of equivalent directions is maximal .    knowing that @xmath59 first coefficients @xmath60 are equal to zero ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) , the equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) give the following dependences between @xmath61    @xmath62 : :    @xmath63 , i.e.    @xmath64 first coefficients    @xmath61 are the same for all projections .",
    "@xmath65 : :    @xmath66    for @xmath67 . @xmath68 .",
    ": :    @xmath69    for @xmath70 .",
    "all these conditions have been proved for both various models of @xmath0 and for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath57 .      due to the symmetry of @xmath0 , in the case of @xmath37 , @xmath73",
    "can be expanded into the lattice harmonics @xmath74 which form an orthogonal set of linear combinations of the spherical harmonics @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the normalization constant and @xmath77 denotes the associated legendre polynomial .",
    "angles @xmath78 describe the azimuthal and the polar angles of the @xmath7-axis with respect to the reciprocal lattice system .    in the case of the hexagonal structure @xmath79 with @xmath53 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath80 @xmath57 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , _",
    "etc_. ) , for the tetragonal structure @xmath90 with @xmath53 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath91 @xmath80 @xmath72 and for the cubic structures @xmath92 are the linear combinations of @xmath93 , where the first three are equal to [ 9 ] :    @xmath94 ,    @xmath95 ,    @xmath96 .",
    "so , for the hexagonal and tetragonal structures a few first lattice harmonics do not depend on @xmath97 . moreover , very often , for some paticular sets of measured spectra , we can not calculate functions @xmath38 ( the matrix in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is singular ) .",
    "for example : if for the hexagonal structure we have only three projections with @xmath7 along the @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 symmetry directions ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the angles @xmath78 are equal to : @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "thus , the first three lattice harmonics have the same values for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 directions and there is no a possibility to evaluate functions @xmath38 . next , if e.g. @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath102 , @xmath106 , @xmath101 , the set of equations for @xmath32 does not have a solution in spite of the fact that the first five harmonics distinguish here all directions @xmath7 . due to these reasons",
    "we propose to treat plane projections of @xmath0 as line projections of @xmath107 and to use the consistency and symmetry conditions derived in sec .",
    "we consider only those spectra @xmath33 for which @xmath7 is changed on the plane perpendicular to the axis of the crystal rotation of the order @xmath49 .",
    "in such a case @xmath107 denotes the line integral of @xmath0 along lines @xmath108 parallel to this axis and @xmath33 can be described by eq.(9 ) .",
    "now all relations obtained for the line projections are valid with @xmath61 being replaced by @xmath109 where either @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( for the planes perpendicular to the main axis of the crystal rotation ) or @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( for the planes with @xmath71 , perpendicular to the previous ones ) .",
    "for example , for three spectra having the hexagonal symmetry and with @xmath7 along the @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 symmetry directions ( denoted here by @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) we have the following relations : @xmath117 for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath81 ( here @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 ( @xmath71 ) , where @xmath122 denotes the norm of the spectrum .",
    "so , to get more information about @xmath116 we should have at least one additional spectrum @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 and e.g. @xmath125 ) on the plane with @xmath71 where @xmath126 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this equality is satisfied for @xmath124 and any @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 , where the @xmath129 and @xmath130 directions are defined by the same @xmath97 with @xmath111 and @xmath124 , respectively . knowing that @xmath131 ( does not depend on @xmath97 )",
    "we obtain that @xmath132 has the same value for each spectrum @xmath133 with @xmath7 described by @xmath124 and any @xmath97 .",
    "this is derived by treating @xmath134 simultaneously as the line projection of @xmath135 and @xmath136 with the symmetry @xmath120 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "here @xmath135 represents the line projection of @xmath0 along the main axis of the rotation , while @xmath137 along any line perpendicular to this axis .",
    "this last dependence is particularly interesting because it gives interdependence between line projections of different densities , while all consistency conditions for the line projections are for the same @xmath138 .",
    "all dependencies , shown here on the example of the hexagonal structure , are valid for the cubic and tetragonal structures where @xmath120 is replaced by @xmath139 . however , for the cubic structures , where three axes of the fourth order exist , one can get some additional rules .",
    "because directions @xmath140 and @xmath102 are equivalent , we obtain that not only @xmath122 but also @xmath141 must be the same for all projections . some of these results can be also derived from eq .",
    "( 2 ) because for the cubic structures all lattice harmonics ( except for @xmath142 ) depend on @xmath78 .",
    "taking as an example directions @xmath143 $ ] , @xmath144 $ ] and @xmath145 $ ] we obtain the following dependences between @xmath146 :    @xmath147)+a_{2}c_{i}([kl0])+a_{3}c_{i}([klh])=0 $ ] for @xmath148    @xmath149)+b_{2}c_{i}([kl0])+b_{3}c_{i}([klh])=0 $ ] for @xmath150 where @xmath151 .",
    "the above equalities arise from the conditions of vanishing all polynomials @xmath152 with @xmath148 and @xmath150 in the expansion of @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath141 satisfies both equations when @xmath155)= c_{1}([kl0])=c_{1}([klh])$ ] what is in agreement with the previous result . knowing additionally that @xmath156)$ ]",
    "does not depend on the direction @xmath144 $ ] , we can conclude that for the cubic structure the value of @xmath157 $ ] ) does not depend on the direction ( denoted here by @xmath145 $ ] ) .    as before",
    ", all relations were proved for both model and experimental profiles .",
    "some examples are presented in the next section .",
    "first , disposing twenty five @xmath45 @xmath1 experimental spectra [ 10 ] for the four metals of the hcp structure with @xmath7 on the plane @xmath120 , we obtained that the conditions @xmath158 and @xmath159 are satisfied with a very high accuracy , lower than @xmath160 ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) , @xmath161 ( @xmath163 ) , @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) and @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) . because the first @xmath168 have the highest values , they are determined the best ( the influence of the statistical noise is the lowest ) .",
    "this very small inconsistency implies that spectra [ 10 ] ( with the average number of counts at peak about 60000 ) were not only measured but also corrected with a very high precision .    in the figure 2",
    "we show results for the theoretical compton profiles for cr [ 11 ] with @xmath7 along @xmath169 $ ] , @xmath170 $ ] and @xmath171 $ ] directions . in this case",
    "( cubic structure ) the first two coefficients @xmath172 should have the same value for each spectrum , while the third coefficient should satisfy the relation : @xmath173-c[110]=3\\{c[110]-c[111]\\}$ ] . after normalizing spectra to the same area ( @xmath174 ) we obtained that a distortion of @xmath141 from its average value is changed from @xmath175 up to @xmath176 and the inconsistency of @xmath162 is of order @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the behaviour of @xmath172 is the same as for previously studied experimental data .",
    "it is connected with the fact that in order to create such spectra it would be necessary to calculate @xmath0 in the whole momentum space @xmath10 , what , of course , can not be done . here",
    "the accuracy of calculating compton profiles was comparable with the statistical noise of 2d acar data [ 10 ] .",
    "of course , in order to get the similar inconsistency of the compton profiles ( where a contribution of core densities is much higher than in a positron annihilation experiment ) the experimental statistic must be also much higher .    in order to examine how these conditions react to an improper shape of @xmath33",
    ", we changed somewhat the shape of one spectrum ( marked in figure 2 by squares ) .",
    "here we would like to point out that this incorrect spectrum does not differ from other spectra too much ( the differences between @xmath177)$ ] and @xmath178)$ ] are higher ) .",
    "after normalizing it to the same area ( @xmath174 ) we obtained that @xmath141 changed its value from -0.7 to -0.74 .",
    "so , here we observe a much higher inconsistency ( @xmath179 ) than for experimental data [ 10 ] ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "all spectra received from experiments are contaminated by statistical noise and thus they are not consistent . depending on the number of measured projections ,",
    "some part of the inconsistent noise is eliminated via the consistency conditions during the reconstruction of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we propose to check ( before the reconstruction ) if spectra were measured and corrected properly ( the inconsistent part of the data can not be too large ) .",
    "for that purpose we can use the interdependences , derived by combining the consistency and symmetry conditions , obtained here for the line and plane projections .",
    "the knowledge of the interdependences rules can be also profitable for an _ improvement _ of data for which densities are not reconstructed ( some part of the inconsistent noise can be eliminated ) .",
    "moreover , it can be applied to verify these techniques which are used for correcting compton scattering spectra ( they are not univocal and can be individual for each spectrum [ 12 ] ) . for that we propose to measure the high resolution _",
    ", denoted usually by @xmath180 , for hexagonal metals with @xmath181 changed on the plane @xmath120 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "having @xmath182 along @xmath99 ( @xmath125 ) , @xmath98 ( @xmath183 ) and @xmath129 ( @xmath184 ) , we can check if @xmath185 for @xmath186 and if @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "of course , the best choice is to study rare - earth metals where the anisotropy of @xmath0 is so high that spectra @xmath180 should be essentionally different .",
