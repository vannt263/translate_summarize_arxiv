    "this is not surprising because the horizon structure changes completely at extremality , ( see , eg .",

    "the exact nature of extremality is still the subject of some debate .",

    "israel @xcite , for example , has proven a form of the third law , which shows that it is impossible to reach extremality by any finite - time , continuous accretion process ( with some caveats ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some simple solutions of the einstein equations for extremally charged objects are known @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , consider the rather unrealistic scenario of collapsing , infinitely thin shells .",
    "moreover , the extremal solutions are evidently unstable , which again casts doubt on their relevance as models for genuine physical objects .    in this paper ,",
    "we take a purely classical point of view and consider the stability of charged , spherical matter distributions that satisfy the einstein equations .",
    "essentially we investigate interior reissner - nordstrm solutions , focusing on the extremal @xmath0 case .",
    "a study of relativistic charged spheres was undertaken thirty years ago by bekenstein @xcite , but without numerics he was unable to reach many firm conclusions about the ability of charge to prohibit collapse .",
    "more recently a numerical investigation has been carried out by de felice et al .",
    "@xcite ( henceforth dfsy ) .",
    "the dfsy study was limited in that it considered only spheres with constant matter density @xmath7 and a power - law charge distribution .",
    "furthermore , although @xmath7 was taken to be constant in deriving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , the stability analysis assumed an adiabatic equation of state , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rest mass density .",
    "as will become clear below , the @xmath10 case is the only convenient one for numerical integration ; nevertheless , it is possible to construct a scheme capable of handling the more general adiabatic equation of state , as well as other charge distributions .",

( [ e ] ) immediately implies @xmath33 note that ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) are of exactly the same form as the exterior reissner - nordstrm solution , as they must be by gauss law .",
    "the only difference is that for the interior case @xmath34 represents @xmath35 rather than the total charge .",

    "[ sec3 ] the basic strategy is simply to integrate ( [ ov ] ) and test for the stability of solutions . before doing",

    "it seems intuitively reasonable that due to electrical repulsion the charge distribution should be weighted toward the surface , but otherwise all choices are basically _ ad hoc_. one can imagine several plausible distributions .",
    "dfsy confined themselves to the simplest case , @xmath63 .",
    "we consider two distributions : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are adjustable input parameters that define the radius of the star and the total charge @xmath67 respectively , and @xmath68 which flattens out for @xmath69 .",
    "note that in both these cases the charge density , obtained by differentiating ( [ q ] ) , diverges at the origin unless @xmath70 . in point of fact , although we have been able to find solutions for the charge distribution ( [ tanh ] ) , the stability analysis is generally inconclusive since no absolute boundary separation can be found consistently over all @xmath66 of a given @xmath71 across the entire range of parameters considered here .",
    "the one exception is @xmath72 in which case the results are qualitatively similar to the exponential distribution ( [ exp ] ) for all @xmath66 , and so we confine ourselves to that case .",
    "scarcely less arbitrariness applies to the equation of state ( eos ) than to the charge distribution .",
    "three obvious possibilities suggest themselves : @xmath73 , the adiabatic eos @xmath74 with arbitrary adiabatic index @xmath71 , and the ultrarelativistic eos , @xmath75 .",
    "however , despite the fact that an exact solution with infinite central density @xmath76 for the last case is known when @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) , we have found it difficult to find convergent solutions for this eos when @xmath78 when iterating over central pressure .",
    "( this is as opposed to iterating over central density , which we do for arbitrary adiabatic index , below ) .",
    "thus we confine ourselves to the first two choices .",
    "we do , however , consider the @xmath79 adiabatic eos , which includes relativistic matter with non - negligible rest mass density ( typically @xmath80 at the origin for @xmath79 , depending on @xmath81 and @xmath66 , and substantially lower ratios for larger @xmath71 ) .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath7 represents the total mass - energy density of the matter plus gravitational field .",
    "generally , the eos is assumed to relate only the rest energy density , @xmath9 , and the pressure . as mentioned in  [ sec2 ] , the total local energy density is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the internal energy density .",
    "we consider only polytropes , for which @xmath82 .",
    "once the charge distribution and eos are specified we can integrate the ov equation . for virtually any case one can imagine , however ,",
    "integrating ( [ ov ] ) is impossible analytically and the integration must be carried out numerically .",
    "even then , except for the case @xmath73 , this turns out to be nontrivial . for @xmath73",
    ", the total mass will be simply @xmath83 . with the boundary condition @xmath84 and a form of @xmath34 to make @xmath85 analytically integrable ,",
    "this allows convenient integration from the outer boundary inward . for more reasonable equations of state",
    ", however , one expects @xmath7 to vanish at @xmath86 as well ( eg . , if @xmath87 ) . in such cases",
    "the entire second term in ( [ ov ] ) vanishes at the outer boundary , which causes a serious problem numerically because @xmath88 , while @xmath89 . thus , unless @xmath90 , an inward integration scheme immediately predicts a negative pressure unless the integration is initiated from some arbitrary outer pressure and surface radius values to compensate for the charge distribution .    for this reason ,",
    "we choose to integrate outwards from @xmath91 .",
    "this strategy also presents difficulties .",
    "we can , say , choose @xmath65 as the prespecified  radius \" of the star , but in starting the integration at the origin , we have no prior knowledge of which combination of parameters @xmath92 ( central density ) , @xmath81 ( central pressure ) , @xmath71 , @xmath66 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath34 will actually produce a star with radius @xmath65 . in other words , if we define the physical surface radius @xmath95 to be the point at which the pressure first goes negative , there is no reason that @xmath95 will equal @xmath65 .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following procedure : for a given parameter set @xmath96 we take a first guess at @xmath97 with arbitrary @xmath81 , then iterate on @xmath92 using a bisection algorithm until @xmath95 converges to @xmath65 . the bisection method assumes a locally monotonic correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where the @xmath100-th estimate of the central density is given by @xmath101 .",
    "one chooses @xmath102 by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a coefficient initially set to unity , but is halved for convergence whenever @xmath105 changes sign .",
    "we find in most cases we can converge on @xmath65 to a relative tolerance of @xmath106 .",
    "the numerical integration is performed using an adaptive fourth order runge - kutta scheme to maintain a constant error tolerance of @xmath107 over a grid constructed with cell spacing scaled to the surface radius such that @xmath108 .",
    "further accuracy is achieved at the outer surface where pressure and density vary sharply by adaptively refining the mesh spacing to a minimum level @xmath109 when the pressure is observed to change sign .",
    "this procedure works well if @xmath65 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , as @xmath65 is increased one eventually hits a barrier @xmath110 beyond which convergence to the @xmath111 tolerance is impossible or @xmath112 becomes so large that the metric function ( [ el ] ) becomes negative .",
    "this latter marks the black - hole limit @xmath113 , where @xmath4 is the exterior gravitational mass .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath114 generally depends on all input parameters , and is computed numerically for each case presented in this paper .",
    "for example , considering an adiabatic eos with @xmath115 , figure [ fig : rvsbeta ] shows the maximum surface radius as a function of @xmath66 for the different @xmath71 considered in this paper .",
    "we are unable to find convergent solutions at radii above each of the curves .",
    "figure [ fig : mvsr - p0 ] plots the total mass @xmath2 as a function of surface radius for @xmath116 and fixed @xmath117 . here",
    "the surface radius is increased from 5% of @xmath114 to the maximum computed value @xmath114 .",
    "each of the solid lines represent different central pressures @xmath81 with the larger pressures resulting in greater masses .",
    "also plotted in figure [ fig : mvsr - p0 ] are the corresponding black hole and extremal charge solutions for comparison . the black hole solution for @xmath118 is found by setting the metric function ( [ el ] ) equal to zero at that point , which gives @xmath119 . by contrast , the extremal solution ( not necessarily a black hole ) is found by first matching the exterior reissner - nordstrm metric to the interior solution ( [ metric ] ) at @xmath120 : @xmath121 which gives the definition of gravitational mass @xmath122 setting @xmath0 gives the extremal curve for @xmath123 : @xmath124    finally we note that the total charge to total mass ratio @xmath125 generally increases monotonically with increasing @xmath65 and fixed @xmath66 , as figure [ fig : qmvsr ] demonstrates .",
    "since we are interested in the maximum or extremal limit of @xmath125 , the subsequent stability plots presented in section [ sec4 ] are computed for those parameter values at the upper bounds of @xmath65 ( @xmath126 ) for which we are able to find convergent solutions .    as a reminder ,",
    "we point out that because we do not know beforehand the exterior mass of the star , the radius @xmath65 in our graphs is not given in units of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath65 is merely where the pressure drops to zero expressed in geometric units .",
    "[ sec4 ] we provide two stability analyses .",
    "the first , discussed in detail in this section , is a normal - mode analysis for radial pulsations of the charged sphere , similar to that performed by dfys ( see also @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the second , discussed in  [ sec5 ] , is based on the variation of energy .",
    "we consider radial pulsations of the sphere with the goal of writing the sturm - liouville equation : @xmath127 here @xmath128 is a ",
    "renormalized displacement function , \" and @xmath129 and @xmath130 are functions of the zeroeth - order ( equilibrium ) solution to the einstein equations .",
    "@xmath131 is the angular frequency of the assumed sinusoidal time dependence of @xmath128 .",
    "once these functions are known , we evaluate @xmath132 and deduce that the solution is stable under radial perturbations if @xmath133 for approximate trial functions @xmath134 that satisfy the same boundary conditions as @xmath128 .    to derive @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath130 is a tedious undertaking ; because we are now dealing with a time - dependent problem , the metric functions in ( [ metric ] ) must be taken to be @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where we assume the first - order quantities are small .",
    "once the perturbation equations are derived , to get the sturm - liouville form , the first - order quantities are eliminated in favor of the zeroeth - order solutions . nevertheless ,",
    "because our equations differ slightly from dfys , we now outline the procedure .",

    "but , since we are increasing charge , we are increasing the gravitational mass @xmath4 over @xmath201 ( see [ gravmass ] ) , and so , paradoxically , when measured in @xmath4 , the stability limit increases , as seen in figure [ fig : stab - adiabaticm ] .",
    "[ sec6 ] we have seen that , contrary to newtonian intuition , in general relativity charge does not tend to stabilize or counterbalance the interior energy density of fluid spheres . to be sure , our numerical results indicate that for a fixed radius , instability sets in at a smaller mass @xmath201 than in the fluid only case .",
    "nevertheless , charge does increase the gravitational mass @xmath4 , and the instability threshold for relativistic charged spheres monotonically approaches the black hole horizon in the extremal limit .",
    "most important , though , for all cases studied the onset of instability of relativistic charged spheres takes place before the attainment of extremality . at that point ,",
    "gravitational collapse into black holes takes place , but these are not extremal holes .",
    "all these results are certainly consistent with the currently accepted form of the third law of black hole dynamics , which forbids attainment of the extremal state by finite time processes involving accretion of positive energy @xcite ( see also appendix ) .",
    "one might legitimately doubt whether studies such as this one have any bearing on reality given that astrophysical objects tend not to be charged . for precisely this reason",
    "it has long been doubted that reissner - nordstrm solutions can represent astrophysical objects . on the other hand , to the extent that charged solutions shed light on the third law , they have been of great interest .",
    "regardless , however , of whether one chooses to interpret charged spheres as stars or as solitons or as models for elementary particles , our results make it difficult to see how extremal objects could arise from any remotely realistic collapse scenario .",
    "a general theorem ruling out stable extremal black holes altogether would be desirable ; it would effectively be an alternate formulation of the third law , as well as a strong version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( or theorem , in that case ) ; not only are stable naked singularities excluded , but stable extremal black holes as well .",
    "+ * acknowledgements * we thank werner israel for an exchange that instigated the appendix .",
    "this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s .",
    "department of energy by lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract w-7405-eng-48 .",
    "israel s proof of the third law @xcite , that the surface gravity of a black hole can never be forced to zero in a finite - time , continuous process , assumed accreting charged shells and that the energy flux crossing the outer apparent horizon of the black hole was positive",
    ". therefore the proof has nothing to say about hawking radiation , because in this case a negative energy flux crosses the apparent horizon , violating the assumptions of the theorem .",
    "moreover , at first glance , it might seem that hawking radiation would drive a black hole toward extremality : if a black hole is emitting neutral particles , for example , the charge would remain constant while the mass decreased , forcing @xmath229 .",
    "it is not terribly difficult to see that this does not happen .",
    "the power radiated by the black hole is @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the surface gravity . for a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "this immediately gives the well known result for the evaporation time @xmath234 .",
    "for a reissner - nordstrm black hole , however , @xmath235 and the surface gravity is given by @xmath236-q^2 } \\label{kappa}\\ ] ] ( see wald @xcite eq .",
    "( 12.5.4 ) ) .",
    "of course , as @xmath237 , @xmath231 approaches zero , and therefore the flux , which goes as the fourth power of @xmath231 is rapidly decreasing .",
    "this suggests that an infinite amount of time is required to reach @xmath0 .",
    "the statement can be made rigorous by integrating ( [ power ] ) for reissner - nordstrm black holes . with @xmath1 and",
    "the above expression for @xmath231 we have @xmath238 where the limits should be from @xmath4 to @xmath34 , assuming @xmath239 initially . with @xmath240 , the expression can be integrated analytically .",
    "the result for the indefinite integral is @xmath241 assuming , for example , that @xmath242 and @xmath243 with @xmath244 , then @xmath245 which clearly diverges in the limit @xmath237 ( equivalently @xmath246 ) .",
    "although we have done this only for @xmath240 , it may hold true generally . if the hawking temperature @xmath247 is initially below the rest mass of the electron , the black hole will radiate only neutral particles and so @xmath34 will remain constant while @xmath4 decreases . plotting ( [ kappa ] )",
    "shows that @xmath231 and hence @xmath247 will actually _ increase _ with decreasing mass until @xmath248 , at which point @xmath249 then monotonically decrease to zero as @xmath250 in the limit @xmath251 .",
    "assuming the maximum temperature is always less than the mass of the electron , then @xmath34 can be expected to remain constant , and evaporation can not proceed in finite time , as discussed above .",
    "if at any time @xmath247 becomes greater than @xmath252 , the hole will evaporate charge .",
    "but for any charged elementary particle @xmath253 due to negligible size of the gravitational interaction .",
    "assuming that for temperatures above the rest mass , all species of particles are radiated with roughly equal probability ( equipartition ) , under evaporation @xmath34 will become negligible compared to @xmath4 and extremality will never be approached .",
    "we emphasize that , as israel points out , the entire discussion neglects any superradiant component which is nonthermal , but it is not clear whether this would alter the conclusion .",
    "we have also neglected other processes , such as discharge from pair production mentioned by page @xcite , which in this case would likely only strengthen the conclusion . in any case , certainly for @xmath254 , hawking radiation can not violate the third law of black hole dynamics and perhaps not in general .",
    "this is consistent with the early work of page and with the point of view that extremal black holes do not exist ."
