    "in quantum mechanics , the central role is played by unitary transformations .",
    "they leave scalar product and norm of states unchanged .",
    "particularly , hamiltonians are required to be hermitian in order to keep unitarity of time evolution . in this section ,",
    "we want to examine how the theory should be modified to keep the norm conserved when a wider class of transformations is considered .",
    "let us consider a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 with discrete spectrum which acts on @xmath1 .",
    "let the operator @xmath2 be a non - unitary bijection of @xmath3 to itself ( and bijection on @xmath4 particularly ) @xmath5 let us use @xmath6 as a similarity transformation @xmath7 it leaves the vector space @xmath8 unchanged .",
    "however , the hamiltonian @xmath9 ceases to be hermitian on @xmath10 .",
    "instead , it satisfies the following relation @xmath11 where the operator @xmath12 is hermitian , strictly positive and has of the following explicit form @xmath13 the norm of states is not preserved under the similarity transformation ( [ btrans ] ) .",
    "there holds the following relation instead @xmath14 to keep the norm conserved , we define an alternative scalar product @xmath15 on the vector space @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the operator @xmath6 may be considered as a unitary mapping between two hilbert spaces @xmath10 and @xmath16 which coincide in vector space @xmath8 but hilbert space structure of @xmath16 is induced by @xmath17 .",
    "particularly , @xmath9 is hermitian in @xmath16",
    ". we may rewrite ( [ normnotconv ] ) as @xmath18    to avoid possible misunderstanding caused by the alternative definition of scalar product , let us call the representation @xmath19 as a hermitian picture while we will call the representation @xmath20 as a quasi - hermitian picture .",
    "the description of a physical system in both representations is equivalent as these are related by the unitary mapping @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of quasi - hermitian picture lies in extended freedom in choice of @xmath6 .",
    "it may be exploited to simplify the hamiltonian and determine its spectral properties more easily . on the other hand , we lose an intuitive interpretation for the operators .",
    "for instance , the coordinate operator in the quasi - hermitian picture @xmath22 may have quite complicated form dependently on the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "concluding , the effort to employ wider class of transformations led to the construction a new hilbert space with non - trivial metric operator . in this context , we may refer to many - body physics where the alternative representation is used in boson realization of fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "the non - hermiticity of resulting bosonic hamiltonian is treated by redefinition of the scalar product which fits to the strategy outlined above .",
    "let @xmath0 describes an ensemble of a huge but fixed number of independent particles .",
    "let us focus to the statistical description of the system .",
    "the state of the system is characterized by a density matrix @xmath23 which can be written in energy representation as @xmath24 the coefficients @xmath25 represents ( up to normalization ) the probability with which we may find the system in the state @xmath26 . in what follows",
    ", we will consider a system in equilibrium . in that case , the density matrix operator is solution of bloch equation @xmath27 with initial condition @xmath28 . its formal solution @xmath29 fixes the coefficients to be @xmath30",
    ". normalization factor of the density matrix depends on the inverse temperature @xmath31 and is called partition function @xmath32 it plays a crucial role in thermodynamics of the system as it allows direct computation of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "let us observe how is the description modified in quasi - hermitian picture .",
    "once we have ( [ rho ] ) satisfying ( [ bloch ] ) , the density operator in quasi - hermitian picture is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and satisfies @xmath35 as long as @xmath6 does not depend on @xmath31 .",
    "let us derive the partition function @xmath36 for ( [ rhotilda ] )",
    ". partition function ( [ z ] ) may be written as @xmath37 thus the partition functions in both pictures coincide and do not depend on the mapping @xmath6 .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for mean value of observable @xmath38 @xmath39 as long as @xmath40 is a trace - class operator .",
    "bloch equation ( [ bloch ] ) resembles schrodinger equation for evolution operator .",
    "the link can be established by the substitution @xmath41",
    ". then ( working in quasi - hermitian picture ) the equation ( [ bloch ] ) reads @xmath42 where we defined @xmath43 .",
    "in @xmath44-representation , we have @xmath45 we should be careful with the interpretation of @xmath46 .",
    "although it is manifestly similar to a quantum mechanical propagator , there is a difference we should keep in mind .",
    "the vectors @xmath47 are not eigenstates of the position operator in the quasi - hermitian picture .",
    "this role is played by @xmath48 , see ( [ x ] ) .    despite the lack of intuitive interpretation ,",
    "the `` propagator '' ( [ propagator2 ] ) is of importance as it allows to compute partition function ( @xmath49 ) with use of standard techniques .",
    "particularly , let us mention standard perturbation theory or path integrals in this context .",
    "dependently on the technique used , the spectrum of @xmath50 is not essential for computation of the partition function .",
    "towards the end of the last century an interest of a few groups of mathematicians has been attracted by the rather unexpected behavior of certain manifestly non - hermitian anharmonic - oscillator hamiltonians which seemed to generate the purely real spectra . in the next stage of development",
    ", it was bender and boettcher who revealed the possible deeper relevance of the similar models ( well exemplified by the  zero mass \" hamiltonian = p^2+i x^3[ix^3 ] without free parameters ) in the context of physics .",
    "subsequently , the reality of the spectra of the similar models has been tested @xcite and , finally , rigorously proved @xcite .    as long as one has @xmath51=0 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ ix^3 ] ) , ( where the operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen as representing the standard space reflection and time reversal , respectively ) , the authors of ref . conjectured that the reality of the spectra of the manifestly non - hermitian hamiltonians of the form ( [ ix^3 ] ) may be attributed to their peculiar anti - linear symmetry called @xmath54-symmetry ( re - interpreted as @xmath52-pseudohermiticity in ref .",
    "this idea initiated an intensive study of pseudo - hermitian operators with anti - linear symmetries @xcite where the original specific choice of the parity is being extended to any invertible hermitian mapping @xmath55 such that the operator equation ^=[pseudoeta]is satisfied . in such a case the spectrum of the corresponding pseudo - hermitian , diagonalizable operator is either purely real or it contains the complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the operator @xmath55 is non - unique and represents rather a class of generally indefinite operators satisfying ( [ pseudoeta ] ) .",
    "however , it revealed that when the spectrum of the hamiltonian is purely real , the class contains positive definite operators and , consequently , a consistent probabilistic interpretation ( including unitary time evolution ) of state vectors associated with pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian is enabled @xcite . with a special denotation of these operators , the equation ( [ pseudoeta ] )",
    "reads now @xmath56    due to its positive definiteness , the metric operator can be decomposed @xmath57 . in this point , we may feel inspired by the previous section and say that the operators @xmath50 and @xmath12 establish quasi - hermitian picture of a physical system . the hermitian picture @xmath58 may provide here an intuitive insight in the nature of interaction which ceases to be transparent in the quasi - hermitian picture . ) , @xmath44 and @xmath59 do not represent position and momentum operators .",
    "these are @xmath60 and @xmath61 in quasi - hermitian picture .",
    "] moreover , additional physical observables in quasi - hermitian picture may be defined with help of appropriate operators in hermitian picture , see eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize , that the current treatment differs from the previous section .",
    "the relation between hermitian and quasi - hermitian representation is more complicated as the operator @xmath12 ( and @xmath6 ) is not given explicitly in the present case .",
    "its construction depends on the hamiltonian @xmath50 and the resulting metric operator is generally non - unique .",
    "there exists rather a class of @xmath12s which satisfy ( [ htth ] ) for given @xmath50 .",
    "the construction and the associated ambiguity of the scalar product @xmath17 represent the main questions within the theory and are tackled in various ways , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of the previous section find their important application here .",
    "we showed ( [ ztilda ] ) that the partition function is the same in both pictures .",
    "thus we may compute @xmath62 in quasi - hermitian picture where the hamiltonian is given explicitly .",
    "this enables direct computation of thermodynamic properties of a physical system in equilibrium described by quasi - hermitian without explicit knowledge of the metric operator @xmath12 .    in the next section , we intend to present a simple example of quasi - hermitian system .",
    "we derive its thermodynamic characteristics independently on both the metric operator and the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of @xmath64 distinguishable particles neglecting their mutual interaction .",
    "the partition function may be factorized @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the partition function of the subsystem . in the quasi - hermitian picture ,",
    "the subsystem is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath67 it is pseudo - hermitian with respect to @xmath55 @xmath68 and keeps real spectrum as long as @xmath69 . in this case , the mapping @xmath6 can be constructed and reads @xmath70 let us further note that the energy levels of the system may depend on the external parameters , e.g. on the volume @xmath71 in which the particle is confined .    we want to find @xmath66 .",
    "it would be possible to compute the partition function exactly .",
    "however , let us pretend that the spectrum of the operator is hard to be found .",
    "we shall solve the equation ( [ propagator ] ) . separating the hamiltonian into its hermitian part and non - hermitian perturbation term",
    "@xmath72 we introduce the following transformation @xmath73 and define a new operator @xmath74 in the interaction representation , the evolution equation ( [ propagator ] ) of the system is given by the following @xmath75 where @xmath76 . integrating both parts of the equation",
    ", we can find the solution iteratively , @xmath77 neglecting the higher order terms , the explicit result is @xmath78 the approximative value of the partition function @xmath62 is @xmath79 @xmath80    it would be in order to discuss the range of parameters ( inverse temperature . ] @xmath81 , coupling constant @xmath82 ) for which the approximation ( [ pertz ] ) is relevant .",
    "instead , let us compare ( [ pertz ] ) with exactly computed partition function @xmath83 in fig.1 .",

    "an ambition of pseudo - hermitian quantum mechanics is to serve as a consistent framework for description of physical processes , comparable with or exceeding the standard theory in predictive power .",
    "currently , the contribution of pseudo(quasi)-hermitian operators is seen in the alternative representation of hermitian systems .",
    "particularly , complicated hermitian hamiltonians can be defined implicitly with help of quasi - hermitian operators which are easier to deal with .",
    "the construction of a mapping which relates these two operators is a crucial task of the theory and attracts a lot of attention .",
    "it is essential for proper probabilistic interpretation of states of non - hermitian hamiltonian and for construction of additional operators representing physical observables .    in the article",

    "particularly , we were interested in thermodynamics of the system .",
    "it was the main observation that the explicit knowledge of the positive - definite metric operator @xmath12 is not essential for derivation of the physical quantities .",

    "moreover , various techniques of standard quantum theory may be used without any modification . in this context ,",
    "let us mention path integrals @xcite or operator method @xcite which might be particularly suitable for computation of partition functions of @xmath54-symmetric hamiltonians with polynomial potentials , e.g. ( [ ix^3 ] ) .",
