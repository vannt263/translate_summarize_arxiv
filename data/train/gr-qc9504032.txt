    "gabriel@xcite _ et al_.  recently established that members of a certain class of nonmetric gravitation theories predict that space is anisotropic and birefringent .",
    "these nonsymmetric theories , for which moffat s ngt@xcite is the prototype , have been studied extensively as potentially viable alternatives to general relativity , but they predict that a gravitational field singles out an orthogonal pair of linear polarization states of light which propagate through the field with different phase velocities . the difference in phase velocities could , in principle , be measured in local test experiments@xcite and , so , violates the einstein equivalence principle . in practice , the sharpest constraints on the magnitude of such gravity - induced birefringence will be inferred from limits on the cumulative effect that propagation through a gravitational field has on the polarization of light .",
    "et al_.  consider the effect that the sun s field could induce and use measurements of the polarization of solar spectral lines to impose sharp new constraints on nonsymmetric gravitation theories .",
    "krisher@xcite considers the effect the galaxy s field could induce and uses pulsar polarization observations to impose a complementary constraint on ngt .    in this paper",
    "we show that the class of nonmetric gravitation theories which predict spatial anisotropy or birefringence is far more extensive than the class of nonsymmetric theories .",
    "indeed , one must take pains to define a nonmetric coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields that does not induce anisotropy and birefringence . consequently",
    ", searching for effects of propagation through a gravitational field on the polarization of light provides tests of the einstein equivalence principle that have a power , generality and significance comparable to those of more familiar atomic anisotropy ( hughes - drever ) tests@xcite and etvs and gravitational redshift tests@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical developments provide a strong motivation for precise new tests of the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "for example , interest in scalar - tensor and multi - tensor gravitation theories has been rekindled by the proliferation of scalar and tensor fields in effective field theories derived from string physics and several threads of quantum gravity research suggest that connection rather than metric may be fundamental .    the view that searching for evidence of gravity - induced birefringence tests the einstein equivalence principle is not unprecedented .",
    "ten years ago ni@xcite remarked that nonmetric gravitation theories encompassed by his @xmath0 formalism could predict birefringence of the type we study .",
    "he also noted that pulsar polarization observations could constrain this possibility .",
    "perhaps the significance of these comments was overlooked at the time because no gravitation theories predicting such birefringence were known and because the effective time resolution of pulsar polarization observations is limited . in any event ,",
    "their significance is now clear .",
    "theories like ngt do predict gravity - induced birefringence and we use galaxy polarization observations to constrain this possibility far more stringently than ni or krisher were able to using pulsar polarization observations . indeed , the linear and circular polarization data for galaxies that we analyze have an effective time resolution that is more than @xmath1 times that of krisher s pulsar polarization data .",
    "a theory of gravity does two things .",
    "it specifies a free , though generally nonlinear , dynamics of the gravitational field and it specifies the coupling between the gravitational field and matter .",
    "the latter determines both how matter generates and how it responds to gravity .    in the case of general relativity",
    "these conceptually distinct components of gravitation physics are discernible in the standard form of the einstein field equation , @xmath2 the structure of the einstein tensor , on the left - hand side , specifies the general relativistic dynamics of the gravitational field itself .",
    "the form of the stress - energy tensor , on the right - hand side , specifies the way in which matter acts as a source of gravity .",
    "these same aspects of general relativity and other lagrangian - based theories of gravity are even more clearly discernible in the structure of the action principles from which their field equations follow , @xmath3 the gravitational part of the lagrangian density , @xmath4 , is distinguished by the fact that it depends only on gravitational fields .",
    "its variational derivative with respect to these fields defines their dynamics .",
    "the variational derivative with respect to the metric of general relativity s gravitational lagrangian density , @xmath5 , is @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding derivative of its nongravitational lagrangian density is @xmath7 and , so , the form of @xmath8 , which depends on both matter and gravitational fields , specifies the way in which matter generates gravity .",
    "its reciprocal role of specifying the way in which matter responds to a gravitational field follows from the action principle  ( [ 2 ] ) on variation with respect to matter fields rather than gravitational ones .",
    "this yields the matter equations of motion .",
    "in general , these need not follow directly from the gravitational field equations as they do in general relativity",
    ".    experimental tests of the einstein equivalence principle focus on the behavior of matter responding to a background gravitational field .",
    "their significance lies in the way they constrain the form of @xmath8 and , thus , provide an empirical foundation for one of gravitation physics fundamental components . tests that reveal no violation of the einstein equivalence principle force the form of the nongravitational lagrangian density toward ones that admit a metric representation , a representation in which a single metric tensor field couples universally@xcite to all matter .",
    "the experimental tests of the einstein equivalence principle that we analyze in this paper involve the propagation of polarized light through a background gravitational field .",
    "we are , therefore , concerned with only that part of the nongravitational lagrangian density which governs the dynamics of the electromagnetic field and we base our analysis on a general model of this lagrangian density introduced by ni@xcite .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that the results of our analysis are easily specialized to yield the predictions of any theory of gravity whose structure is encompassed by ni s @xmath0 formalism .",
    "the other advantage is that a broad consideration of conceivable nonmetric couplings provides a context in which to judge how different experimental tests of the einstein equivalence principle compete with and complement one another and , so , to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of the empirical foundation of one of the most fundamental aspects of gravitation physics .",
    "the structure of the @xmath0 formalism is consistent with the basic tenets of the dicke framework@xcite .",
    "spacetime is a differentiable manifold and matter fields and phenomenological gravitational potentials are tensor fields .",
    "given the apparent smoothness of space and time and the view that physics should not depend in an essential way on a choice of coordinates , it is difficult to fault these axioms as a basis for phenomenology . furthermore , it is assumed that as gravity is `` turned off '' the nongravitational lagrangian density , @xmath8 , reduces smoothly to the corresponding special relativistic lagrangian density .",
    "the most general lagrangian density consistent with these axioms and with assumptions of electromagnetic gauge invariance , linearity of the electromagnetic field equations and the absence of couplings to derivatives of gravitational potentials is @xmath9 where the electromagnetic field is related to a 4-potential in the usual way , @xmath10 and where @xmath11 is a tensor density that provides a phenomenological representation of the gravitational field .",
    "note the analogy between @xmath11 and a macroscopic electrodynamic constitutive tensor density .    to see how the phenomenological field @xmath11 is constructed from a specific theory s scalar , vector and tensor gravitational fields , the structure of the theory s electromagnetic lagrangian density can be matched to that of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . in metric theories of gravity",
    "it is constructed from the metric tensor alone , @xmath13 .",
    "notice that @xmath11 inherits symmetries analogous to those of the riemann tensor from the antisymmetry of @xmath14 and from the symmetrical way in which it appears in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . consequently , @xmath11 has twenty - one independent components .",
    "ni says that his formalism has twenty - one nonmetric degrees of freedom because , in general , one can not exploit the formalism s covariance to transform away any of these independent component potentials .",
    "the freedom to redefine coordinates is exhausted by putting the formalism s @xmath15 field into a standard form .",
    "this field represents the coupling between the gravitational field and scalar particles .",
    "in this paper we consider the propagation of light through relatively weak gravitational fields that vary on length and time scales that are far longer than the light s wavelength and period respectively .",
    "we , therefore , adapt the coordinate system in which the lagrangian density ( [ 3 ] ) is represented to the weak - field limit and we employ the methodology of geometric optics to analyze the light s propagation .    in a lorentzian coordinate system",
    "the electromagnetic lagrangian density of special relativity has the form in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , in the weak field limit we can find quasi - lorentzian coordinate systems in which the field @xmath11 has the form @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",

    "we base the analysis that follows on the eikonal equation which determines local coordinate velocities of wave propagation .",
    "this equation is derived by inserting the representation ( [ 5 ] ) into the electromagnetic field equations and ignoring all derivatives other than those of the phase function .",
    "propagation equations for the vector amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 and equations governing post - geometric - optic corrections can be derived by taking systematic account of smaller derivatives but we shall not need these equations here .    neglecting derivatives of the slowly varying background field , the electromagnetic field equation that follows from eq .",

    "the effects of a nonmetric background field on physical standards of length and time are such that a local observer who uses rulers and clocks to measure velocities of light having the polarizations singled out by the field will generally obtain results that differ from the coordinate velocities @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 . to that order",

    "propagation through the observer s laboratory only affects the state of the last of these components .",
    "the unpolarized component is itself an incoherent superposition of equal amplitudes of the basis polarization states while the linearly polarized component consists purely of one or the other of the basis polarization states .",
    "the shift in the relative phase of waves in the basis states that accumulates as these waves propagate with different phase velocity has no effect on the polarization of either of these components .",
    "on the other hand , the elliptically polarized component is a coherent superposition of equal amplitudes of the basis states so its polarization is sensitive to the relative phase of these waves .",
    "indeed , the relative phase determines this component s @xmath76 and @xmath77 degrees of polarization , @xmath80 . as light propagates during a coordinate time interval @xmath81 this relative phase shifts by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the light s angular frequency .",
    "it is this shift that can affect light s polarization .",
    "we piece together the cumulative effect of propagation through a background gravitational field on a signal s polarization from such local effects .",
    "this is particularly easy to do when the orientation of the basis polarization states singled out by the background field is fixed along light rays , as is the case for light propagating through the essentially static , spherically symmetric background fields that we consider in the next section .",
    "a ray threading through a spherically symmetric field lies in a plane and , for the fields we consider , there is a fixed orientation between this plane and the @xmath21 amplitudes of the polarization states singled out by the fields . in such cases the relative phase shift that accumulates between waves in the basis states is simply @xmath84 where , since the local value of @xmath72 is explicitly @xmath38 , the integration runs along the unperturbed ray that runs straight through the quasi - lorentzian coordinate system with unit speed from source to receiver .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) is the local value of @xmath72 for the ray s direction .",
    "one consequence of the relative phase shift ( [ 24 ] ) is that a signal whose elliptically polarized component has @xmath85 when emitted will have some degree of circular polarization when it is received .",
    "the degree of circular polarization received is proportional to a small accumulated shift , @xmath86 we base our interpretation of galaxy polarization data in the next section on this expression .",
    "we have seen that a nonmetric background field induces birefringence if and only if @xmath87 or @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) is nonzero for some direction of wave propagation at some event in spacetime .",
    "before we turn to the derivation of empirical limits on such birefringence let us consider how such limits constrain the form of the coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "note that the expressions @xmath87 and @xmath58 involve only the symmetric , trace - free parts of the tensors @xmath45 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",

    "this conclusion and the expression ( [ 23 ] ) for @xmath72 are in accord with remarks of ni@xcite for which the preceding analysis provides a detailed justification .",
    "the preceding analysis examined nonmetric couplings between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields and established which single out pairs of linear polarization states that propagate through a gravitational field with different phase velocities . using stokes parameters",
    "based on those states , we found that such gravity - induced birefringence causes @xmath98-polarized radiation to develop a degree of circular polarization as it propagates .    here",
    ", we interpret polarization measurements of extragalactic sources cataloged by weiler and de pater@xcite in light of this prediction and derive a precise new constraint on the strength of birefringence that could be induced by the galaxy s gravitational field .",
    "note that even a cursory examination of the data indicates that such birefringence can not be strong .",
    "if it were , one would expect to measure substantial circular and linear polarization of radiation from extragalactic sources with about the same likelihood .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "measurements reveal significant circular polarization of radiation from extragalactic sources only rarely while they frequently reveal substantial linear polarization .    as a first approximation",

    "this is not unreasonable , especially if one accepts the existence of a substantial dark - matter halo .",
    "note that the assumed spherical symmetry does not preclude the detection of gravity - induced birefringence .",
    "radiation reaching the earth from an extragalactic source generally does not propagate radially through the galaxy s field because the earth lies 10 kiloparsecs from the galaxy s center .",
    "a ray along which such radiation travels lies in a plane defined by the locations of the source , the earth and the center of the galaxy .    at each point along a ray the only direction that the galaxy s spherical field can single out is the radial one .",

    "the highest frequency data that we analyze imposes a limit of 0.12 radians on the relative phase shift between the polarization states singled out by the galaxy s field .",
    "we are , therefore , resolving a fraction @xmath165 of a cycle at the 5 ghz observation frequency .",
    "this corresponds to a relative time delay of @xmath166 seconds .",
    "our time resolution is , therefore , more than @xmath1 times krisher s .",
    "since , as krisher remarks , constraints on the magnitudes of @xmath131 or @xmath134 are proportional to the square root of the time interval resolved , the precision of our constraint ( [ 32 ] ) is accounted for .",
    "the local isotropy of space is one consequence of the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "atomic physics experiments of hughes - drever@xcite type are the classic tests of this prediction . in this paper",
    "we have shown that searching for effects of propagation through a gravitational field on the polarization of light provides a precise , qualitatively different test for spatial anisotropy , specifically spatial anisotropy that induces a birefringence of space . in the context of the @xmath0 formalism such anisotropy",
    "is associated with ten of twenty - one nonmetric degrees of freedom .",
    "the significance of any test of the einstein equivalence principle lies in the constraint it imposes on the form of the coupling between gravitational and matter fields .",
    "constraints on gravity - induced birefringence force the structure of the electromagnetic lagrangian density ( [ 3 ] ) towards the form having @xmath167 that the phenomenological symmetric tensor potential @xmath168 and scalar potential @xmath93 can represent the @xmath0 formalism s remaining eleven nonmetric degrees of freedom is clear upon counting components . the fact that this lagrangian density predicts no birefringence in the geometric optics limit is clear from the metric form of the coupling between @xmath168 and the electromagnetic field and from the identification of @xmath93 as the @xmath169 part of @xmath37",
    ". note , however , that carroll and field@xcite have shown that at post - geometric - optics order the @xmath93 coupling does induce a dispersive optical activity which they have constrained using galaxy polarization data .",
    "two features are primarily responsible for the precision of einstein equivalence principle tests based on the interpretation of polarization data for extragalactic sources .",
    "first , they focus on global consequences of einstein equivalence principle violations .",
    "they constrain shifts in relative phase that accumulate from minute local effects rather than seeking the local effects directly .",
    "second , they are interferometric in character .",
    "their sensitivity to accumulated phase shifts comes from exploiting the coherence inherent in polarized light .",
    "note that the sharp new constraint on ngt derived above is far beyond the reach of local hughes - drever experiments , as indicated by an estimate analogous to one that gabriel@xcite _ et al_.  make of local anisotropy induced by the sun s field in ngt .",
    "sharper tests of the einstein equivalence principle are all but certain to result from surveys of extragalactic sources that yield linear and circular polarization measurements at frequencies higher than the 5 ghz limit of the weiler - de pater catalog",
