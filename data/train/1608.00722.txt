    "recent technological advancements have enabled increasing use of infrastructure - free wireless communications .",
    "for example , smartphone users can exchange information with each other by exploiting local wi - fi and bluetooth connections , or using the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) cellular device - to - device communications ; and even unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) can directly communicate with nearby ground stations and send back photos and videos in real time .",
    "although these infrastructure - free communication links bring great convenience to our daily lives , they can also be used by malicious users to launch various security attacks .",
    "for instance , terrorists can use peer - to - peer wi - fi connections to communicate and facilitate terror attacks , and criminals can control uavs to spy and collect private information from rightful users . as such malicious attacks are launched via infrastructure - free wireless communications , they are difficult to be monitored by solely using existing information surveillance methods that intercept the communication data at the cellular or internet infrastructures . in response to such new threats on public security , authorized parties such as government agencies should develop new approaches to legitimately surveil these suspicious wireless communication links over the air ( e.g. , via eavesdropping ) to detect malicious attacks , and then intervene in them ( e.g. , via jamming and spoofing ) to quickly defend and disable these attacks .",
    "there have been several recent studies in the literature that investigate the surveillance of wireless communications , where authorized parties efficiently intercept suspicious wireless communication links , extract their exchanged data contents , and help identify the malicious wireless communication links to intervene in .",
    "conventionally , the methods for wireless communications surveillance include wiretapping of wireless operators infrastructures and installation of monitoring software in smartphones .",
    "recently , over - the - air eavesdropping has emerged as a new wireless communications surveillance method . among others ,",
    "passive eavesdropping ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and proactive eavesdropping @xcite are two approaches implemented at the physical layer , in which authorized parties can deploy dedicated wireless monitors to overhear the targeted wireless communications , especially the infrastructure - free ones .",
    "efficient surveillance can help detect and identify malicious users and their communications .",
    "after that , authorized parties need to quickly respond and defend them via wireless communication intervention .",
    "for example , the security agency may need to disrupt , disable , or spoof ongoing terrorists communications to prevent terror attacks at the planning stage , and it is also desirable to change the control signal of a malicious uav to land it in a targeted location and catch it . in the literature ,",
    "physical - layer jamming ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is one existing approach that can be employed to intervene in malicious communications , though it was originally proposed for military instead of public security applications . in the physical - layer jamming , the jammer sends artificially generated gaussian noise ( so - called `` uncorrelated jamming '' @xcite ) or a processed version of the malicious signal ( so - called `` correlated jamming '' @xcite ) to disrupt or disable the targeted malicious wireless communications . however , jamming the targeted communications at the physical layer is easy to be detected , and may not be sufficient to successfully intervene in malicious activities .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the targeted communication continuously fails due to the jamming attack , the malicious users may take counter - measures by changing their communication frequency bands or switching to another way of communications .",
    "thus , we are motivated to study a new wireless communication intervention via spoofing at the physical layer , which can keep the malicious communication but change the communicated information to intervene in .",
    "= 1     we investigate the new physical - layer spoofing by considering a fundamental three - node system over additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , an intermediary legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious communication link from alice to bob , such that the received message at bob is changed from alice s originally sent message to the one desired by the spoofer . under this setup",
    ", we propose a new symbol - level spoofing approach , in which the spoofer designs the spoofing signals via exploiting the symbol - level relationship between each original constellation point of alice and the desirable one of the spoofer , so as to optimize the spoofing performance .",
    "in particular , we consider two cases when alice employs the widely - used binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) and quadrature phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) modulations , respectively .-",
    "ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( @xmath0-qam ) and @xmath0-ary phase shift keying ( @xmath0-psk ) with @xmath1 . nevertheless , under these modulation techniques , how to design spoofing signals to optimally solve the average sser minimization problem is generally a more difficult task , since the corresponding sser functions will become very complicated .",
    "] the objective of the spoofer is to minimize the average spoofing - symbol - error - rate ( sser ) , i.e. , the average probability that the symbols decoded by bob fail to be changed as the desirable ones of the spoofer .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* in the bpsk case ( with the constellation points being @xmath2 ) , the spoofing signals are designed by classifying the symbols into two types . in each of type - i symbols ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bpsk]-(a ) ) , where the original constellation point of alice and the desirable one of the spoofer are identical ( both are @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , the spoofing signal is designed to _ constructively _ combine with the original signal of alice at bob to help improve the decoding reliability against gaussian noise . in each of type - ii symbols ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bpsk]-(b ) ) , where the original constellation point of alice and the desirable one of the spoofer are opposite ( one is @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) but the other is @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) ) , the spoofing signal is designed to _",
    "destructively _ combine with the original signal of alice at bob , thus moving the constellation point towards the desirable opposite direction .",
    "we minimize the average sser by optimizing the spoofing signals and their power allocations over type - i and type - ii symbols at the spoofer , subject to its average transmit power constraint .",
    "although this problem is non - convex , we derive its optimal solution .",
    "it is shown that when the transmit power at alice is low or the spoofing power at the spoofer is high , the spoofer should allocate its transmit power to both type - i and type - ii symbols .",
    "otherwise , when the transmit power at alice is high and the spoofing power at the spoofer is low , the spoofer should allocate almost all its transmit power over a certain percentage of type - ii symbols with an `` on - off ''",
    "power control . * in the qpsk case with the constellation points being @xmath5 with @xmath6 , the symbols are further classified into three types , where in type - i , type - ii , and type - iii symbols , the original constellation points of alice and the desirable ones of the spoofer are identical , opposite , and neighboring , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpsk ] . for type - i and type - ii symbols ,",
    "the spoofing signals are designed to have equal strengths for the real and imaginary components , such that at the receiver of bob they can be be constructively and destructively combined with the original constellation points by alice , respectively . for type - iii symbols ,",
    "the spoofing signals are designed to have independent real and imaginary components .",
    "under such a design , we formulate the average sser minimization problem by optimizing the spoofing power allocations over symbols , subject to the average transmit power constraint .",
    "though this problem is non - convex and generally difficult , we obtain its optimal solution , motivated by that in the bpsk case .",
    "* numerical results show that for both bpsk and qpsk cases , the symbol - level spoofing scheme with optimized transmission achieves a much better spoofing performance ( in terms of a lower average sser ) , as compared to the block - level spoofing benchmark where the spoofer does not exploit the symbol information of alice , and a heuristically designed symbol - level spoofing scheme .",
    "it is worth noting that in the existing literature there is another type of higher - layer spoofing attack , which can also be utilized for wireless communication intervention ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the medium access control ( mac ) spoofing @xcite and internet protocol ( ip ) spoofing , a network attacker can hide its true identity and impersonate another user , so as to access the targeted wireless networks .",
    "nevertheless , for these higher - layer spoofing , the network attacker needs to establish new wireless communication links to access the network .",
    "in contrast , our proposed symbol - level spoofing is implemented at the physical layer , which can change the communicated information of _ ongoing _ malicious wireless communications , thus leading to a quicker response and intervention that is also more likely to be covert .",
    "it is also worth comparing our proposed symbol - level spoofing versus the symbol - level precoding ( not for security ) in downlink multiuser multi - antenna systems @xcite . in the symbol - level precoding ,",
    "the transmitter designs its precoding vectors by exploiting the symbol - level relationships among the messages to different receivers , such that the constructive part of the inter - channel interference is preserved and exploited and only the destructive part is eliminated . although the symbol - level spoofing and precoding are based on a similar design principle of exploiting the symbol - level relationship among co - channel signals , they focus on different application scenarios for different purposes , thus requiring different design methods .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] introduces the system model and formulates the average sser minimization problem .",
    "sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec : qpsk ] propose the symbol - level spoofing approach and design the spoofing signals and their power allocations for the cases of bpsk and qpsk modulations , respectively . section [ sec:4 ] presents numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed symbol - level spoofing design as compared to other benchmark schemes .",
    "finally , section [ sec:5 ] concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] , we consider a fundamental three - node system over awgn channels , where an intermediary legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious wireless communication link from alice to bob by changing the communicated data at the bob side . we consider that the malicious communication employs the bpsk or qpsk modulation techniques , which are most commonly used in existing wireless communication systems . in the @xmath7th symbol of this block , we denote the transmitted signal by alice as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the transmit power per symbol at alice , and @xmath10 denotes the message that alice wants to deliver to bob . here , @xmath10 is equally likely chosen from the set of constellation points @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the bpsk and qpsk cases , respectively .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath14 .",
    "first , we introduce the receiver model of bob by considering the case without spoofing .",
    "accordingly , the received signal by bob in the @xmath7th symbol is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the noise at the receiver of bob , which is an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and unit variance . based on the maximum likelihood ( ml ) detection , the decoded message by bob",
    "is expressed as @xmath17    next , we consider the spoofing strategy employed by the spoofer . it is assumed that the spoofer perfectly knows the transmitted symbol information @xmath10 s of alice . here , @xmath10",
    "s can be practically obtained by the spoofer via efficient eavesdropping or wiretapping beforehand .",
    "for example , if alice is an intermediary node of a multi - hop communication link , then the spoofer can obtain @xmath10 s via eavesdropping the previous hops ; if alice gets its transmitted data from the backhaul or infrastructure - based networks , then the spoofer can acquire them via using wiretapping devices to overhear the backhaul communications ; and furthermore , the spoofer can even secretly install an interceptor software ( e.g. , flexispy ) in the alice s device to get @xmath10 s . note that the assumption about the perfect symbol information at the spoofer has been made in the existing correlated jamming literature ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) to improve the jamming performance .",
    "we make a similar assumption here for the purpose of characterizing the spoofing performance upper bound , and leave the details about the symbol information acquisition for future work . based on the information of @xmath10 s ,",
    "the spoofer designs the spoofing signal as @xmath18 in the @xmath7th symbol ( the design details will be provided in the next section ) .",
    "then , the received signal at bob is expressed as @xmath19 with the ml detection , the decoded message by bob is expressed as @xmath20    the spoofer aims to maximize the opportunity of changing the messages of alice to be the desirable ones by itself .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the desirable constellation point for the @xmath7th symbol , which is equally likely chosen from @xmath11 and is independent from the message @xmath10 sent by alice .",
    "nevertheless , due to the limited spoofing power and receiver noise , it is difficult for the spoofer to ensure that all symbols @xmath22 s are successfully changed to be the desirable @xmath21 s . in this case , we define the probability of unsuccessful spoofing in any symbol @xmath7 as the sser , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "then , the objective of the spoofer is to minimize the average sser , i.e. , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the statistical expectation over all possible symbols .",
    "suppose that the spoofer is constrained by a maximum average transmit power denoted by @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
