    "@xmath5 capture in @xmath0kr is a rare process that has not been observed yet .",
    "theoretical calculations for @xmath5 within the frames of different models ( qrpa , msm and su(4)@xmath6 ) predict the following half - life periods with respect to @xmath7-capture : @xmath8 yr @xcite , @xmath9 yr @xcite , and @xmath10 yr @xcite . the values from works",
    "@xcite and @xcite were obtained by taking the fraction of @xmath5-capture events in @xmath0kr with respect to the total number of @xmath11-capture events to be 78.6% @xcite . by comparing experimental and theoretical results",
    "one can see that sensitivity of measurements has already passed beyond the lower margin of theoretical predictions .",
    "this fact stimulates the research to test the approach used in model @xcite .",
    "when two electrons are captured from the _ k_-shell in @xmath0kr , a daughter atom of @xmath0se@xmath12 is formed with two vacancies in the _ k_-shell . the technique to search for this reaction is based on the assumption that the energies of characteristic photons and the probability that they will be emitted when a double vacancy is filled are the same as the sum of respective values when single vacancies of the _ k_-shell in two singly ionized se@xmath13 atoms are filled . in such a case ,",
    "the total measured energy is @xmath14 kev , where @xmath15 is the binding energy of a @xmath1 electron in a se atom ( 12.65 kev ) .",
    "the fluorescence yield upon filling a single vacancy in the _ k_-shell of se is 0.596 .",
    "the energies and relative intensities of the characteristic lines in the @xmath1 series are @xmath16 kev ( 100% ) , @xmath17 kev ( 52% ) , @xmath18 kev ( 21% ) , and @xmath19 kev ( 1% ) @xcite .",
    "there are three possible ways for de - excitation of a doubly ionized _ k_-shell : 1 ) emission of auger electrons only @xmath20 ; 2 ) emission of a single characteristic quantum and an auger electron @xmath21 ; and 3 ) emission of two characteristic quanta and low - energy auger electrons @xmath22 , with probabilities of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively . a characteristic quantum can travel a long enough distance in a gas medium between the points of its production and absorption .",
    "for example , 10% of characteristic quanta with energies of 11.2 and 12.5 kev are absorbed in krypton at a pressure of 4.35 atm ( @xmath26 g/@xmath27 ) on a path of 1.83 and 2.42 mm long , respectively ( the values of absorption factors are taken from @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the paths of photoelectrons with the same energies are 0.37 and 0.44 mm , respectively .",
    "they produce almost pointwise charge clusters of primary ionization in the gas . in case of the event with the escape of two characteristic quanta absorbed in the working gas and a single auger electron ,",
    "the energy is distributed among three pointwise charge clusters .",
    "it is these three - point ( or three - cluster ) events possessing a unique set of features that were the subject of the search in @xcite and @xcite .    to register",
    "the process of @xmath7-capture in @xmath0kr a large proportional counter ( lpc ) with a casing of m1-grade copper has been used .",
    "the lpc is inside the low - background shield made of 18 cm copper + 15 cm lead + 8 cm borated polyethylene .",
    "the installation is placed in one of the chambers of the underground laboratory of the gallium germanium neutrino telescope experiment at the baksan neutrino observatory , inr ras at a depth of 4700 m.w.e . where cosmic ray flux is lowered by @xmath28 times to the level of @xmath29 @xmath30s@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the output signals from the lpc are registered by a digital oscilloscope .",

    "in fig.[f1]_a _ one can see total spectra , normalized for 1000 h , obtained for the background of lpc filled with krypton enriched in @xmath0kr ( total collection time is 9457 h ; orange curve ) , and with natural krypton ( total collection time is 6243 h ; blue curve ) .",
    "spectrum ( normalized for 1000 h ) of the background of lpc filled with krypton enriched in @xmath0kr ( orange curve ) and with natural krypton ( blue curve ) : ( _ a _ ) - all events , ( _ b _ ) - single - point events , ( _ c _ ) - two - point events and ( _ d _ ) - three - point events.,width=302 ]      the shape of difference spectrum in the range of @xmath32 kev is described well enough by the model spectrum composed of @xmath33-spectra due to @xmath34kr and @xmath35c decay in proportion 1:17 .",
    "background counting rates in this range are 56.3 h@xmath31 and 47.2 h@xmath31 for lpc filled with @xmath0kr and @xmath3kr , respectively .",
    "difference in @xmath34kr isotope activities in the samples is due to its different residual value achieved during the isotopic purification .",
    "@xmath35c isotope comes into the working gas during the continuous usage of the counter , supposedly as a result of slow sublimation of organic molecules ( ethyl alcohol and acetone were used to clean the details at the time of mounting the detector ) from the surface of the body of the counter .",
    "this overactivity of @xmath35c in the enriched krypton is due to the fact that this sample was measured first when the main portion of this organic vapor was there .",
    "actually , all the events in the operating energy range produced by @xmath33-particles absorption can be considered as single - point ones . except for those events where",
    "@xmath33-particles have lost partially their energy through generating bremsstrahlung photon .    at energies",
    "@xmath36 kev , fig.[f1 ] , the counting rate of events in spectrum of natural krypton is much higher than in spectrum of krypton enriched in @xmath0kr .",
    "this is due to the presence , in the original atmospheric krypton , of cosmogeneous radioactive isotope @xmath37kr .",
    "counting rate of events in this energy range is 220 h@xmath31 , which corresponds to the volume activity of @xmath37kr @xmath38 min@xmath39kr .    at 46.5 kev , in spectra from the sample natural and enriched krypton fig .",
    "[ f1]_a _ , one can see the peak corresponding to the source of @xmath40pb ( t@xmath41 yrs , @xmath33-decay , @xmath42 kev , with a yield of 4.25% per decay @xcite ) .",
    "spectra of fig.[f1]_d _ have been used for further analysis of the three - point events .",
    "each event of these spectra is characterized by a set of energy deposits distributed over three point - like regions of the working volume of the counter .",
    "energy deposits are proportional to the gaussian areas ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , which describe three pointwise components of the composite current pulse of primary ionization electrons on the border of the gas amplification region .",
    "the gaussian numbering corresponds to the arrival time sequence of the components coming into the gas amplification region . to simplify the selection of events with a given set of features the amplitudes of components for each event",
    "are arranged in the increased order @xmath46 $ ] . in the sought - for events the minimal amplitude value ( two groups of auger - electrons from residual excitation with energies of @xmath47 kev and @xmath48 kev ) will correspond , with superfluously exhibited resolution , to the condition ( `` _ _",
    "c1 _ _ '' ) 0.9 kev @xmath49 kev . to select useful events",
    "we introduce a parameter of ratio of average amplitude to maximum one .    with an allowance for the resolution most part of useful events",
    "would have this condition ( `` _ _ c2 _ _ '' ) fulfilled within @xmath50 .",
    "the selection of events from spectra in fig .",
    "[ f1]_d _ corresponding to the conditions ( `` _ _ c1__''+``__c2 _ _ '' ) allows an additional decrease in the background of the expected peak energy region and gives a general representation of spectrum shape for wide range of energies .",
    "the selected spectra are plotted in fig.[f2 ] .      from the figure ,",
    "we can see , that both spectra have a similar pick in the energy region of @xmath51 kev corresponding to the sought - for effect energy region . to find their nature the study of the distribution of the number of background events of various types along the anode wire has been performed .",
    "this distribution was plotted using the dependence of the relative amplitude of the first after - pulse on the distance between the point of origin of the main pulse and the middle point of the length of the anode wire .",
    "this distance defines the solid angle viewing the inner surface of the copper cathode cylinder .",
    "the solid angle through which the working surface of the cathode is viewed from the middle point of the anode wire and from the end points of the working length of the anode wire is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , fig.[f3]_a_.    the density of distribution of the solid angle for the points uniformly distributed along the anode wire are presented in fig.[f3]_b_. there is a dependence of the relative number of photoelectrons , knocked out of the copper surface by the photons produced in the gas amplification of the primary ionization , on the value of the solid angle .",

    "fig.[f4 ] demonstrates @xmath54-distribution for the background of lpc filled with kr enriched in @xmath0kr ( orange curve ) and with natural kr ( blue curve ) .",
    "one can see the excess of events in the histogram in the region with @xmath54 taken from the ends of the anode wire .",
    "these additional events at the ends of the working length of the anode wire are produced by particles coming out of the dead near - end volumes of a working gas .",
    "in addition to proportionally amplified components a total pulse could be composed of components of larger energy deposits that occur in the dead volume and are collected in the ionization mode at the end bulbs of the anode .",
    "specifically , the peak at @xmath56 kev in spectra of fig.[f2 ] could well be formed by alpha - particles emitted from the surface of the cathode in the near - end region where the anode wire is thickened with copper tubules .",
    "alpha - particle can ionize _",
    "k_-shells of krypton atoms , and in this case the characteristic photons would have energy of 12.6 kev .",
    "these photons can penetrate into the working volume of lpc where gas amplification occurs .",
    "registration of two photons gives two points .",
    "the third point is produced by ionization of alpha - particle collected in the ionization mode . by discarding pulses with @xmath57",
    ", one can completely eliminate such events from three - point spectra .",
    "the selection coefficient of useful event @xmath58 remains high enough : @xmath59 .",
    "one can see the three point event spectra selected for @xmath61 from the spectra presented in fig .",
    "the background in energy region of @xmath62 kev for @xmath0kr is 15 events for 9457 h@xmath31 , and for @xmath3kr is 4 events for a period of 6243 h@xmath31 ( or 6 events for 9457 h@xmath31 ) .",
