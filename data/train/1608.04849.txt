    "stirap usually requires a relatively long interaction time which will accumulate decoherence and destroy the desired dynamics .",
    "therefore , many researchers have paid more attention to speeding up the adiabatic population transfer  @xcite . there are two methods , counterdiabatic driving  ( transitionless quantum driving ) and lewis - riesenfeld invariant , are widely used to speed up the adiabatic population transfer , and also many schemes have been proposed for constructing quantum gates based on the two methods  @xcite . however , unfortunately , the two methods unavoidably suffer from some experimental obstacles . on one hand ,",

    ", lewis - riesenfeld invariant leads to pulse schemes that either need an infinite energy gap to be perfect  @xcite , or do not smoothly turn on or off  @xcite . and",
