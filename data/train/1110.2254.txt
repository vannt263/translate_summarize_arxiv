    "it has been shown the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) contributions in unpolarized elastic @xmath3 scattering play an important role in extracting the electromagnetic form factors of the proton from the angle dependence of cross section .",
    "it is natural to expect that similar effects may exist in the unpolarized @xmath1 , which is also used to extract the electromagnetic @xmath4 form factor or @xmath5 from the angle dependence of cross section @xcite . in the literature , many model dependent calculations @xcite and model independent analyses @xcite have been made to study tpe contributions in elastic @xmath3 scattering , while the tpe contributions in @xmath1 are much more complex and the discussion on such tpe contributions is deficient .",
    "formally , how to keep gauge invariance in hadronic level for such processes @xcite is a non - trivial problem , since two finite - size charged particles play their roles . before discussing the gauge invariant tpe contributions in @xmath1 , it is a good basis to study the gauge invariant tpe contributions in @xmath6 . the tpe contributions in the latter process have been studied in @xcite , while the contact term is usually neglected .",
    "this leads to manifest breakdown of gauge invariance .",
    "for the processes with charged non - point - like particles , the usual way to keep the full amplitude gauge invariant is to multiply form factors with the amplitudes for point - like particles . in this letter , we introduce a gauge invariant lagrangian to treat the tpe contributions in @xmath6 .",
    "such a method can also be applied to treat the tpe contributions in @xmath7 directly .",
    "we arrange our discussion as follows : in section 2 , the tpe contributions in the literature are reviewed and the way to restore gauge invariance at the amplitude level is discussed ; in section 3 , a simple gauge invariant lagrangian is constructed to describe the electromagnetic interactions of @xmath4 and the tpe contributions are discussed by this lagrangian ; in section 4 , the numerical results are presented .",
    "for a charged point - like pseudoscalar particle , the electromagnetic interaction to the lowest order can be described as @xmath8 with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the charge of pseudoscalar particle . to keep the gauge invariance , a contact term may be introduced by the minimal coupling .",
    "this is different with point - like spin-@xmath12 particle where contact term is not necessary .    for finite - size charged pseudoscalar particles such as @xmath13 with @xmath14 ,",
    "higher order interactions are needed to described its electromagnetic structure . in the literature",
    "@xcite , to describe such structure a form factor is directly multiplied with the point - like particle vertex .",
    "this corresponds to the following replacement for the vertex : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the momentum of incoming @xmath13,out coming @xmath13 and photon . by such replacement ,",
    "it is easy to check that the sum of amplitudes corresponding to tpe diagrams fig.[fig : tpe - diagrams](a ) and fig.[fig : tpe - diagrams](b ) is not gauge invariant . to restore the gauge invariance ,",
    "the contact term should be considered as the point - like particle case , with the simple replacement is(we named it method a ) :    2.0 truein1.98 truein 2.0 truein    @xmath17      with such a method based on the amplitudes directly , in principle that is not the case . and",
    "it is also not easy to extend it to processes with two finite - size charged particles in a unitary way . in the following , we construct a simple gauge invariant lagrangian to discuss the tpe contributions .",
    "to show the tpe contributions , we define @xmath29 with @xmath30 the one photon exchange amplitude , a / b refer to method a / b and ( a)/(b)/(c ) refer to corresponding diagrams , respectively . in feynman gauge",
    ", we can prove the sum @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 with any form factors as input though @xmath33 are not equal to @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "generally such equivalence is not true for other gauge parameters . and the contributions from diagrams @xmath35 are not equivalent by the two methods .    to show the detail ,",
    "we take the same form of @xmath36 with @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38gev .    6.0 truein    with this monopole form factor as input the tpe contributions can be calculated directly . and",
    "we subtract the ir divergence in the same way as @xcite .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig - delta - epslion ] shows @xmath39(@xmath40 ) vs. @xmath41 in feynman gauge where @xmath42 , @xmath43 the scattering angle and @xmath44 denotes the correction from the box diagrams in the soft photon approximation given by the standard treatment of mo and tsai @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig - delta - epslion ] shows @xmath45 vs. @xmath41 .",
    "the practical calculation shows the corrections @xmath46 in feynman gauge are about @xmath47 in almost all @xmath41 region by both two methods for @xmath48 from @xmath49gev@xmath50 to @xmath51gev@xmath50 .",
    "the relative magnitudes @xmath52 are shown in tab.[tab:1 ] .",
    "an interesting property is that @xmath52 are independent on @xmath41 .",
    "they are very small when @xmath53gev@xmath50 and increase with @xmath48 .",
    "the small @xmath46 result in almost the same full tpe contributions by the two methods .",
    "this means the main results by @xcite are kept , while this does not mean the contact term can be neglected in other processes or other gauges . when extending the calculation to @xmath1 , the contributions from such term need to be considered more carefully and the method b is favored because of the manifest gauge invariance .     &",
