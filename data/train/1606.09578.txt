    "silicon takes the unique position in both the conventional main - stream electronic industry ( i.e. c - mos ) and the emerging fields of quantum information science and technology such as spintronics @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . its strength derives from the matured capacity of extreme high purity and low cost material growth , and perhaps more crucially , the orders of magnitude tunability in electrical conductivity enabled by doping and gating . silicon ( si ) has continued to reveal another crucial property , that is , its long spin lifetime due to the relatively small atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , bulk inversion symmetry , and zero nuclear spin in the abundant isotope @xmath0si .",
    "two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) occupying the few lowest quantized 2d subbands of various si surfaces and quantum wells has long become an important playground for fundamental science @xcite and more recently , quantum computing qubit platforms through gate - defined or donor - defined quantum dots @xcite . in particular , the long spin lifetime and the ability to control the confined electrons through externally applied electrical voltage ( i.e. fast gates ) near the si surface are the main drivers of the great interest and activity on si - based spintronics and quantum computing architectures .    with respect to spin relaxation , there are some key differences between 3d and 2d si systems worth emphasizing right at the outset . in particular , the confining potential at the interface , where the 2deg resides , may break the inversion symmetry of the si crystal .",
    "this generally results in spin splitting in the band structure and induces an effective momentum - dependent magnetic field for conduction electrons @xcite , often referred to as the rashba field arising purely from the structural asymmetry in real space .",
    "in addition , quantum wells with odd number of si layers or broken rotoinversion symmetry at the si - ge interface @xcite induce generalized dresselhaus field @xcite .",
    "such structural soc effects obviously are not present inside the 3d bulk si and can exist only in the 2deg . when electrons undergo momentum scattering ( e.g. by impurities or phonons ) in the presence of rashba / dresselhaus effect , their spins precess randomly over time and relax @xcite .",
    "this dyakonov - perel ( dp ) process has been the only main spin relaxation mechanism studied so far in si 2deg @xcite .",
    "this has led to the general belief , questioned in the current work , that the dp mechanism is the only spin relaxing mechanism in si 2deg that needs to be considered theoretically .    in this work ,",
    "we bring in a fundamentally different spin - relaxation mechanism , which may gradually dominate over the dp mechanism with increasing impurity densities or doping .",
    "this new impurity - induced spin relaxation mechanism does not rely on the effective rashba / dresselhaus magnetic field between scattering events , but rather flips spins right at the scattering events , through the contact spin - orbit interaction at the impurity core .",
    "therefore our present mechanism can be termed a _ yafet _",
    "process @xcite .",
    "while the scattering is driven by impurities in both mechanisms at low temperatures , the difference is that scattering serves to interrupt the spin precession in the dp process whereas it facilitates spin flip in the yafet process . as a result , instead of weakening with higher impurity density or lower mobility as in the dp spin relaxation , our mechanism grows stronger with increasing ( decreasing ) impurity density ( mobility ) , and therefore can be distinguished experimentally from the dp process .",
    "we believe that some contributions of this new impurity - induced yafet process to si 2d spin relaxation may have already been detected experimentally as we discuss later in this article .",
    "we note that in 3d si , our process is already known to be the experimentally dominant electronic spin relaxation mechanism in high doping situations @xcite .",
    "the other aspect we highlight is the tunability of spin lifetime .",
    "while the charge transistor builds on the tunable conductivity ( i.e. tunable carrier momentum relaxation time ) , it is desirable that the spin relaxation time can be controlled as well for spintronic applications . as we will show in detail",
    ", the leading - order spin flip occurs only during intervalley scattering and between two non - opposite valleys among the six si conduction valleys ( so called `` @xmath1-process '' @xcite ) , whereas it vanishes during intravalley scattering or intervalley scattering between two opposite valleys ( `` @xmath2-process '' ) . for various 2deg plane orientations",
    "relative to the si crystallographic direction ( e.g. 100 , 110 , 111 or arbitrary orientation ) , it is well known that the resulting 2d electronic ground states have different valley configurations , with the ground state valley degeneracy varying from 1 to 6 depending on surface orientations and details @xcite . as such , the spin lifetime determined by this mechanism in 2deg",
    "will be distinguishable just owing to different plane orientations of the 2d system , producing substantial anisotropy in the 2d spin relaxation .",
    "moreover , the tunability of the relative valley energies by stress and especially , by gate voltage in si mosfets , can enable fast on - chip spin lifetime control .",
    "spin - orientation dependence of the spin relaxation , absent for the charge mobility , can also be similarly controlled .",
    "since valleys do not play a central role in the dp process , which is governed entirely by the structural asymmetry , such orientation or gate voltage dependence of spin relaxation is qualitatively different in the dp mechanism @xcite .",
    "this difference can also distinguish our proposed mechanism from the dp mechanism with respect to si 2d spin relaxation .    in 3d bulk si , as we mentioned this novel yafet process",
    "has been shown to be the dominant spin relaxation mechanism when the scattering is caused by donor impurities @xcite .",
    "it is caused by the spin - dependent interaction with the impurity core , and is far more important than the spin flip during intravalley scattering by the long - range coulomb interaction , or during intervalley scattering by the spin - independent part of the impurity core potential , neither of which exhibits the empirically strong donor dependence @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to introduce this important mechanism into the si 2deg , build up its primary trend qualitatively and quantitatively , and discuss its experimental relevance and applications .",
    "since the dp process and our process are completely independent spin relaxation mechanisms , generically both should be present in si 2deg , and their relative quantitative importance will depend on all the details of the specific system and samples being studied .",
    "we briefly discuss the scenarios where our proposed mechanism can be of importance and utilized .",
    "the first apparent criterion is low temperature and moderate - to - high impurity density , so that phonon - driven spin relaxation is relatively weak .",
    "conversely , our mechanism is most likely overshadowed by the dp spin relaxation process in intrinsic to low - doped 2deg systems , typical for si / sige quantum wells and other modulation - doped heterostructures where interface impurity scattering is relatively weak @xcite , except for symmetrically designed wells @xcite where the structural asymmetry can be reduced .",
    "it can be easily shown that dp spin relaxation alone leads to rapidly diverging spin lifetime once the mobility @xmath3 is lowered to a few m@xmath4/vs @xcite .",
    "also , as the present mechanism relies on the soc between the free electron and the impurity core , for a given impurity density its quantitative effect is ranked according to the sign of impurity charges : positively charge impurities @xmath5 neutral impurities @xmath6 negatively charged impurities , the last of which repel the electrons and render little central - cell correction @xcite . as such , both n - type sige quantum well and accumulation layer in n - type mosfet are good candidates for studying our mechanism . in low - mobility",
    "si mosfet samples , however , inversion as well as accumulation layers can be both relevant due to the dominant interface oxide charges @xcite , which could scatter carriers strongly leading to a strengthening of our mechanism .",
    "noticeably , this mechanism is more effective in 2d than in 3d si , as the former retains ionized donors under most relevant experimental conditions @xcite .    in sec .  [",
    "sec : theoretical formulation ] we develop our basic theory of 2d spin relaxation , obtaining detailed results for the relaxation time for different surface orientations and applied external stress in sec .",
    "[ sec : detailed_results_for_2deg ] .",
    "section  [ sec : experimental_implications ] is devoted to a discussion of our results in the context of experimental implications and the existing 2d spin relaxation experiments .",

    "[ sec : summary ] with a summary and an outlook . the intervalley scattering physics and its relevant symmetry analysis is reviewed in the appendix .",
    "our spin relaxation mechanism arises directly from the impurity soc , in contrast with the structural soc effects that emerge from a combination of atomic soc and broken structural symmetry .",
    "the electron spins flip upon scattering .",
    "moreover , the spin flip is governed not by the spin mixing in the conduction electron states but by the soc of the scattering potential . our approach",
    "to formulate the scattering of electron states in the 2deg subbands by an impurity potential is to take doubly - applied effective mass approximation ( ema ) @xcite .",
    "one of the ema is conventionally applied with the envelope functions of subband states confined in a quantum well or near the surface @xcite ( as discussed in more detail below , we do not consider the opposite - valley coupling due to interface in our leading - order theory ) . assuming the scattering matrix element for conduction states in a 3d bulk si of volume @xmath7 is @xmath8 between valley @xmath9 , spin @xmath10 and valley @xmath11 , spin @xmath12",

    "we first elaborate the physics of the spin - flip matrix element @xmath8 , where another use of the ema is crucial to relate a scattering problem with a donor - state problem",
    ". then we study in detail the different specific confinements and resulting subbands .",
    "the bulk spin - flip scattering is treated rigorously in terms of the general symmetry of the impurity potential @xcite .",
    "since the initial and final conduction states are the eigenstates of the bulk si ( one - body ) hamiltonian @xmath20 , the scattering potential is the difference between the substitutional impurity and the original si atom , @xmath21 , and breaks the @xmath22 space symmetry of the diamond lattice structure . without going into the details of @xmath23 ( including the screened coulomb potential and short - ranged central - cell correction ) , @xmath23 obeys the tetrahedral @xmath24 point group symmetry @xcite and one can derive the matrix element form ( @xmath25 ) with the correct dependence on valleys and spin orientation of the involved conduction states @xcite .",
    "we summarize the relevant intervalley scattering in bulk si and its symmetry analysis in the appendix . between conduction states at the valley centers",
    ", it turns out that spin flip survives only in intervalley @xmath1-process scattering .",
    "its counterparts in intravlley and intervalley @xmath2-process scattering are forbidden by the @xmath26 rotation symmetry of the @xmath24 group and the time reversal symmetry , respectively .",
    "we denote the bare spin angular dependence of @xmath27 without the quantitative prefactor as @xmath28 , and the expression between @xmath29 and @xmath30 valleys for arbitrary spin orientation @xmath31 reads @xcite , @xmath32 where the dimensionless constant @xmath33 is the ratio between the two symmetry - allowed terms ( in particular , from the @xmath34-symmetry states of the @xmath24 group ; see appendix for details ) .",
    "this leads to the anisotropic dependence of spin relaxation on spin orientation .    in order to determine the magnitude of the prefactor in @xmath35",
    ", we make an important connection between it and the spin - split spectrum of the localized impurity states , using the essence of ema . by comparing the scattering problem and the localized eigenenergy problem of the same impurity",
    ", one can realize that the potential is exactly the same for the two problems and the only difference between the localized state and the conduction state comes from the envelope function in the former due to the coulomb confinement . as a result , the prefactor in @xmath35 can be related to the spin splitting @xmath36 of the bound impurity states such that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the impurity bohr radius and @xmath7 the bulk volume , an ema effect not too different from that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_2d0 ] ) applied for the 2deg confinement .",
    "when the experimental spectrum is available for @xmath36 , such as those in group v donors @xcite , this method is most efficient and also likely more accurate than numerical calculations that may miss part of the microscopic contributions .",
    "the ratio constant @xmath33 is estimated to be about 2 from spin relaxation data in highly doped n - type si @xcite . for other types of substitutional impurities @xmath33 is expected to have a value of the order of unity . in principle , an estimate of @xmath33 can be obtained by first principles calculations which are out of scope for the current work .",
    "again it is much preferable by empirically comparing with experiments since a precise quantitative calculation of @xmath33 is essentially impossible theoretically , particularly in the context of spin relaxation in the 2deg . as discussed in the introduction , in general , the soc scattering strength depends on the type of impurities being considered , and would in general be smaller for neutral and negatively charged impurities .",

    "these individual @xmath46 expressions are important in evaluating spin relaxation in si 2deg , where not all valleys are always equally occupied and can be subsequently summed together .",
    "more specifically , the anisotropy of effective mass and strain may split the energy degeneracy of the six valleys in different ways , but always keep energy the same for the two opposite valleys .",
    "this is true without including the small effects from soc and short - wavelength perturbation beyond the ema , which could induce splitting of the order of 1 mev or less @xcite .",

    "[ sec : detailed_results_for_2deg ] .",
    "a similarly sudden change in @xmath127 anisotropy can also occur for the ( 110 ) 2deg due to our mechanism .",
    "apart from the 2deg plane orientation , a number of aspects are important in the experimental verification of our proposed spin relaxation mechanism .",
    "first , it is crucial ( and we urge future experiments ) to measure a series of samples with different mobilities ( @xmath3 ) at same carrier densities ( and all other parameters ) .",
    "the ( anti)correlation of @xmath127 with @xmath3 is a characteristic signature for yafet ( dp ) spin relaxation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the crossover occurs at modest doping levels , as the spin lifetime from the dp mechanism rises rapidly past tens of @xmath3s already around mobility @xmath307",
    "@xmath308vs @xcite .",
    "in particular , our mechanism should become dominant when the 2deg region is heavily doped .",
    "second , there is an positive correlation between conduction electron density and spin relaxation in the dp mechanism .",
    "the rashba or generalized dresselhaus field scales linearly with the wavevector ( @xmath309 ) measured from valley bottom yet our spin flip matrix elements depend little on @xmath309 .",
    "third , for the mosfet setup , it is useful to measure @xmath127 separately for both the bulk si and the 2deg to deduce the contribution of interface disorder to the 2deg spin relaxation .",
    "it is also possible to deduce the distribution of 2deg impurities from the gate voltage dependence of @xmath127 : from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tau_s_2d ] ) and ( [ eq : u_2d ] ) , @xmath310 for a uniformly distributed @xmath311 while @xmath312 if all impurities are concentrated at the interface [ @xmath313 . for the si / sige setup ,",
    "making two - sided symmetric confinement may separate out the contribution from the dp spin relaxation , as the change of interfacial symmetry property greatly affects the dp mechanism through the envelope functions but leaves the yafet one the same .",
    "in addition , as our calculated spin orientation dependence [ rooted in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u_xy])-([eq : u_zy ] ) ] is distinct from that of the dp mechanism due to the rashba or dresselhaus field , @xmath127 anisotropy measurement can also help to disentangle the two contributions ( for the large magnetic field limit , we note that , the dp mechanism is partially suppressed similar to the bulk case @xcite ) .",
    "parenthetically , while this work does not focus on the dp mechanism , we point out the existing studies concerning its various contributions @xcite .",
    "different views have emerged to account for the same experimental measurement in si / sige quantum well @xcite , being it dominated by the rashba field @xcite or the dresselhaus one @xcite .",
    "they lead to different soc anisotropy but similar overall spin relaxation rate as both soc fields scale linearly in wavevector in the 2degs .",
    "dp spin relaxation and its anisotropy has also been studied in si / sige quantum dots @xcite . up to the present",
    ", the relative magnitude of the rashba and dresselhuas - like soc has yet to be verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , our mechanism relies on the short - range interaction with the impurity core and directly measures the soc strength of the impurity atoms .",
    "the spin relaxation rate scales quadratically with @xmath36 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u_2d ] ) and ( [ eq : tau_s_2d ] ) ] , and it increases significantly by switching from low atomic - number to high atomic - number dopants for the same density . therefore , different types of impurities that lead to similar mobility may yield very different @xmath127 times according to their soc strengths , a unique signature of this spin relaxation process .",
    "we suggest future spin relaxation measurements in 2d si systems as a systematic function of mobility , carrier density , impurity type , surface and spin orientation , and applied stress in order to develop a complete understanding of the mechanisms controlling spin relaxation of free carriers near si surfaces .",
    "the few existing measurements simply do not have enough information for a definitive conclusion .",
    "last , in order to establish the relative strength of our spin relaxation rate in comparison to the momentum relaxation rate , which determines the device charge mobility , we calculate their relative ratio ( @xmath314 ) for a few representative cases where impurities are the dominant source of scattering ( i.e. at low temperatures where phonons are unimportant ) .",

    "( [ eq : tau_s_2d ] ) and the momentum relaxation time @xmath317 takes the form appropriate for mobility calculations in 2d transport studies @xcite .",
    "the momentum scattering matrix elements are governed by the well - known screened coulomb interaction in the intravalley scattering , as appropriate for scattering by the random charged impurities . for this interaction ,",
    "the impurity distribution profile can be approximated as a @xmath318 function normal to the 2deg plane . under the 2d rpa screening ,",
    "the momentum relaxation rate in the quantum limit is given as @xcite , @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the conductivity effective mass different for each specific 2deg orientation @xcite , @xmath297 is the 2d impurity density , permittivity @xmath186 is the si permittivity , @xmath321 is the 2d fermi wave number , 2d thomas - fermi wave number @xmath322 , and @xmath323 is the number of populated valleys including the spin degree of freedom ( @xmath17 and @xmath324 denoting valley and spin ) .",
    "the dependence on fermi level ( similarly , on @xmath321 or @xmath111 ) is very slow for both @xmath316 and @xmath317 within a given fermi energy window between 2d subbands @xcite .",
    "this can be clearly seen for @xmath316 over many order of magnitudes of @xmath111 from fig .",

    "they are both nearly constant over the large region @xmath325 , i.e. , about 10% of the length of the brillouin zone .",
    "this near independence of fermi level allows us to obtain simple estimation for @xmath314 for each specific 2deg orientation . to get the leading - order estimate ,",

    "we have introduced in si 2deg a previously overlooked yet important spin relaxation mechanism due to electron - impurity scattering .",
    "this mechanism dominates over other spin relaxations in the multi - valley si conduction band as impurity density increases , and can be significantly suppressed when electrons are transferred into two opposite ground valleys by specific 2deg orientations and stress configurations .",
    "we provide the general expression for obtaining the leading - order spin relaxation rate under arbitrary confinement potential , applied stress , and subband occupation .",
    "we calculate quantitatively the ( @xmath283 ) spin relaxation time @xmath205 as a function of spin orientation @xmath10 , as well as of the conduction electron density and confinement strength for the representative square and triangular wells .",
    "moreover , the consequences of various stress configurations have been worked out in details .",
    "importantly , this newly discovered spin relaxation mechanism combined with the si 2deg setup provides interesting possibilities to tune spin lifetime as well as its dependence on spin orientation ( or applied magnetic field direction ) substantially by on - chip gate voltages and possibly by local stress .",
    "such a tunability of spin relaxation in mosfet - type si devices could have potential spintronic applicability .    also crucially ,",
    "we provide experimental ways ( elaborated in sec .  [ sec : experimental_implications ] ) to verify our spin relaxation mechanism and distinguish it from the dp spin relaxation effect from the generalized rashba / dresselhaus field in si 2degs , by exploiting their different dependence on impurity densities and types , on the interface symmetry properties , and on 2deg plane , spin and stress orientations .",
    "regarding a general expansion of this model , we point out that for 2deg near the interface with considerable amount of disorder , a variation of our impurity - driven intervalley spin - flip process may become quantitatively important in determining the spin relaxation rate .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , dp spin relaxation mechanism alone leads to much longer spin lifetime for low - mobility 2deg than observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , spin lifetime is apparently shorter in 2deg near typical si / sio@xmath278 interfaces , indicating impurity - driven elliott - yafet spin relaxation . while our spin - flip matrix elements [ eq .  ( [ eq : u_s_free ] ) ] apply specifically to substitutional impurities in si with their given symmetry , it is a basic rule that lower - symmetry disorder inherits the allowed transition matrix elements .",
    "thus the key idea of zeroth - order intervalley spin - flip scattering @xcite robustly holds for irregular defects , with additional scattering channels potentially open depending on the specific defects .",
    "it is therefore possible that interface impurities ( even when they are completely nonmagnetic as our theory entirely restricts itself to any magnetic interface impurities will of course very strongly affect spin relaxation near the surface through direct magnetic spin - flip scattering ) are playing a strong role in determining the 2d spin relaxation time in disordered si / sio@xmath278 mosfets by participating in the yafet process identified and analyzed in the current work .",
    "obviously , figuring this out remains an open and important future experimental challenge in si spintronics .",
    "this work is supported by lps - mpo - cmtc .",
    "to be self - contained , we provide the essential physical picture of intervalley coupling in bulk si and the relevant symmetry analysis and selection rules for sec .  [",

    "crystal symmetry determines that 6 energy valleys reside cylindrically along @xmath337 and @xmath150 axes .",
    "this well - known multivalley picture of si supplies relevant information for the electron states involved in this work .",

    "<S> through the theoretical study of electron spin lifetime in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) confined near the surface of doped si , we highlight a dominant spin relaxation mechanism induced by the impurity central - cell potential near an interface via intervalley electron scattering . at low temperatures and with modest doping </S>",
    "<S> , this yafet spin flip mechanism can become more important than the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation arising from the structural rashba or dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling field . as the leading - order impurity - induced spin flip happens only between two </S>",
    "<S> non - opposite valleys in si , 2deg systems in si mosfets or sige heterostructures are a natural platform to test and utilize this spin relaxation mechanism due to the valley splitting near the interface and the tunability by electrical gating or applied stress . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed new spin relaxation mechanism may explain a part of the spin relaxation contribution to si - based 2deg systems , and should have spintronic applications in si - based devices . </S>"
