    "the cloud trajectories in the bar potential are self - intersecting which results in a large number of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the collisions induce shocks that dominate the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar matter in the region , in particular the molecular gas .",
    "the shocks inject turbulence into the gas and are a potential heating source .",
    "turbulence is measured by the increased linewidths of the molecular gas in the galactic center region , with values typically of tens of km  s@xmath23  whereas giant molecular clouds in the disk of the milky way exhibit linewidths of only a few km  s@xmath23 .",

    "* ) find that the initial mass function in the central parts of the galactic center region is skewed toward massive stars more than elsewhere in the local universe .",
    "in addition , the sheer amount and density of molecular material ( about a few per cent , or a few @xmath24m@xmath19 , of all molecular gas in the milky way is concentrated in about 0.01% of the volume ) coupled with a star formation rate of @xmath25m@xmath19yr@xmath23(e.g . * ? ? ?",

    "the high density and short lifetimes of the massive stars also produce many compact , energetic objects and the cmz is under the influence of a large flux of uv and x - ray photons as well as cosmic rays that can penetrate the molecular gas .",

    "the molecular gas defines the site and the material for star formation and it is an important goal to directly measure the parameters of the molecular gas such as temperature , density , turbulence , ionization fraction and magnetic field penetration . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the temperature of the gas .",
    "our goal is to produce a temperature map of the galactic center gas , in particular of the denser gas phase on parsec scales that match the size of the individual star formation locations .",
    "a comparison of the temperatures with nearby sources , and a correlation with the cloud properties will allow us to derive the most likely heating sources of the gas , and whether they are external or internal to the gas clouds .",
    "we decide to use ammonia as a temperature tracer .",
    "ammonia ( nh@xmath28 ) has a peculiar structure of a prolate symmetric top , a tetrahedron with a nitrogen atom in one corner and three hydrogen atoms in the remaining corners .",
    "the nitrogen atom can tunnel through the plane defined by the three hydrogen atoms .",
    "this possibility removes the degeneracy of the symmetric top levels ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) at @xmath31 , which splits the energy levels into doublets .",
    "transitions between those levels can be measured as inversion lines. the inversion line frequencies directly depend on the rotational states of the molecule . by measuring the intensity of an inversion line one can thus derive the number of nh@xmath28  molecules a the given rotational state . the population interchange between different k ladders is solely governed by collisions , and all ( @xmath32,@xmath30 ) states decay fast into the metastable @xmath33 levels .",
    "the distribution of all ( @xmath29,@xmath29 ) states is thus a result of the energetics of the collisions , and is simply described by a boltzmann distribution at a temperature @xmath34 .",
    "ammonia is thus an excellent thermometer .    in the following we present interferometric observations of the ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions across a large fraction in the cmz which we use to construct a temperature map of the clumped gas in the region at pc size resolution .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in sect.[sec : obs ] , followed by our results in sect.[sec : results ] .",

    "we observed the galactic center during 8 nights on 2005 august 38 , 10 , and 12 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca , project i d : c1322 ) with 5 antennas in the most compact , hybrid h75 array configuration ( baselines in the range of 31 to 89 m ) .",
    "antenna ca06 was also used but , due to the long baselines to the rest of the array ( @xmath35 km ) , it is down - weighted and does not contribute substantially to the surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "the k  band system at the atca was tuned to observe both polarizations at a center frequency of 23.708ghz with a bandwidth of 64mhz split into 128 channels .",
    "this setup was chosen to observe both , the nh@xmath28(1,1 ) ( rest frequency : 23.6945ghz ) and ( 2,2 ) ( rest frequency : 23.7226ghz ) lines simultaneously within the same band ( when adjusting for the systemic velocity of the galactic center and the observatory velocity at the time of the observations ) .",
    "this resulted in a velocity resolution of @xmath36 km  s@xmath23  at a total local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity range of 180 to + 165 km  s@xmath23  common to both lines .",
    "given that the shortest baseline is 31 m , the array is only sensitive to emission less than @xmath37 , which corresponds to about half the primary beam of the observations ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "uv_coverage we set up the following mosaicking strategy : the field was split up into 6 different , equal sized sub ",
    "regions along galactic longitude , with 140 pointing centers each . in addition , each sub  region was furthermore split up into two different scans , each of which covers half ( i.e. 70 pointings ) of the area : an @xmath45 scan along galactic longitude and a @xmath47 scan along galactic latitude ( see fig.[fig : uvcover ] ) .",
    "scans of the fields were started at different sidereal times during the 8 nights making sure that each scan and field , i.e. the entire 840 pointings of the survey , are covered at least once per night and in rare occasions twice .",
    "the typical _ uv_coverage of a single pointing is shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : uvcover ] .",
    "note , however , that due to our distinct @xmath45 and @xmath47 scan driving scheme and the overlaps of the primary beams in the hexagonal pattern , the actual _",
    "uv_coverage at any position on the map is better .",
    "each pointing has an integration time of @xmath46s per night , accumulating to @xmath50min in total .",
    "time lost between the pointings due to acceleration and deceleration of the atca dishes for our survey amounts to about a second and is therefore negligible .",
    "flux calibration was performed using daily observations of the atca standard calibrator pks1934638 .",
    "the @xmath51jy bright phase ( complex gain ) calibrator pks1710269 was observed twice for 2min each @xmath45 or @xmath47 scan , i.e. every @xmath52min ( see sect.[sec : mos ] ) .",
    "pks1710269 is located at the galactic coordinates @xmath53 , @xmath54 and can be considered to be a point source for this array configuration and frequency .",
    "the same source was used to update the pointing of the individual atca antennas every @xmath55hours with typical corrections of @xmath56 .",
    "based bandpasses were determined by daily @xmath57min integrations on pks1255 - 053 ( also known as 3c279 ) , which has a flux of @xmath58jy in k  band .",
    "we estimate the absolute flux uncertainty to @xmath58% .",
    "note , however , that both ammonia lines were observed in the same band .",
    "relative flux values and resulting parameters such as the temperature ( sect.[sec : temp ] ) are therefore much more accurate .",
    "all data reduction steps were performed with the _ miriad _ software package @xcite .",
    "all data were first corrected for atmospheric opacity ( task _ atlod _ with option _ opcorr _ ) and edited for corrupt visibilities and shadowed antennas .",
    "furthermore , the first seven and last 3 edge channels were discarded . the task _ mfcal _ was used to obtain bandpass and complex gain solutions and _ gpboot _ performed absolute flux calibration .",
    "this solution was bootstrapped to the complex gain calibrator ( and eventually to the data ) when the latter was at the same elevation as the flux calibrator pks1934638 .",
    "the 1.2 cm radio continuum was separated from the _ uv _ data using line  free channels at either end of the spectra and in between the nh@xmath28  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines ( task _ uvlin _ ) .      the task _ invert _ was used to fourier transform the visibilities into a combined mosaic image of all pointings , including the corrections for the primary beam shapes . during that step",
    "the visibilities were weighted in the natural scheme as well as by the inverse of their noise variance .",
    "eventually the data were deconvolved with the maximum entropy algorithm as implemented in _",
    "mosmem_. a first step comprised a non  restricted 30 iteration run of _ mosmem _ across the mosaic , followed by a restoration of the cube ( task _ restor _ ) .",
    "this cube , however , still showed considerable sidelobe structure .",
    "the results improved substantially after using the result from the first application of _ mosmem _ , convolving it to about twice the natural beam size , and blanking all values below 100mjybeam@xmath23 per channel , in the following we call this cube the mask. eventually , the original data set was deconvolved again , but we forced _",
    "mosmem _ to only act on those pixels where the mask was non  blank .",
    "the restoration process of the resulting new deconvolved model with the residuals of the deconvolution process did eventually preserve the fluxes in the maps .",
    "the effects of the sidelobes on the data , however , were drastically reduced .",
    "we checked the fluxes of the maximum entropy deconvolution with the more familiar clean algorithm ( task _ mossdi _ ) and found that while the fluxes are comparable , the extended emission was much better reproduced with _",
    "the final data have a beam size of @xmath59 , with a position angle of @xmath60 , corresponding to a physical resolution in the galactic center of @xmath61pc @xmath62pc .",
    "the pixel size of the data was chosen to be 4 .",
    "the flux rms noise per channel is @xmath63mjybeam@xmath23 which corresponds to an rms brightness of @xmath64mk .",
    "eventually , the total data cube was split into cubes that comprise only the nh@xmath28  ( 1,1 ) or the nh@xmath28  ( 2,2 ) inversion lines .",
    "using the line  free channels from our data , we are also able to construct a 1.2 cm continuum map which is displayed in fig.[fig : m0](b ) .",
    "the dynamic range across all pointings of the mosaic is of order @xmath65 with the brightest sources toward sgra * at @xmath66k ( with some confusion from close - by sources ) , and sgr b2 ( m ) and ( n ) with main beam brightness temperatures of 48.5k and 27.9k , respectively .",
    "the mini  spiral associated with sgra * is also visible as is the sgr b1 region at @xmath67 .",
    "some of the most striking features are the presence of the non - thermal radio arcs along galactic longitudes of @xmath68 .",
    "their fluxes increase from high to low latitudes from @xmath69 to @xmath70k with the brightest , @xmath71k spots in the pistol or sickle region at @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig : m0 ] ; for a spectral index analysis , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the thin , unresolved vertical filaments appear to be connected in projection to the thermal , arched filaments that start at @xmath73 and extend to @xmath74 . between that position and the sgr a * region ,",
    "a number of scattered radio continuum point sources are detected in the map .",
    "overall , the 1.2 cm atca radio continuum map exhibits a very similar morphology when compared to the 21 cm and 90 cm very large array maps presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the low frequency maps , however , also contain a number of finer , arcminute long filaments , perpendicular to the plane , sometimes called non - thermal radio filaments ( nrfs ) or threads , that we do not detect in our 1.2 cm data .      in fig[fig :",
    "spec ] we show spectra from the ammonia datacubes at different positions in the cmz .",
    "the measured parameters of gaussian fits to the spectra are listed in table[tab : pos ] and derived values in table[tab : derived ] . for better orientation",
    ", we also indicate the area that the positions belong to in table[tab : derived ] . ammonia ( 1,1 ) peak brightness temperatures are typically around @xmath75k with values of up to @xmath76k .",
    "nh@xmath28(2,2 ) peak temperatures are typically @xmath57% weaker than those of the ( 1,1 ) line .",
    "fwhm widths of the sample spectra are 20 - 40 km  s@xmath23 . some of the positions show multiple ammonia components and are listed with `` a '' and `` b '' appendices in the tables .",
    "ammonia has hyperfine structure which needs to be distinguished from multiple gas components and also adds to the fwhm .",
    "an analysis is presented in sect.[sec : tau ] .",
    "absorption is observed toward the star forming regions sgrb2 ( n ) at position 32 , sgrb2 ( m ) at position 29 , and the supermassive black hole sgra * at position 7 .",
    "the absorption spectra are rather complex and contain all components along the lines of sight from the earth to the cmz .      the integrated ammonia ( 1,1 ) intensity map is shown in fig.[fig : m0 ] .",
    "in this representation , the velocity integrated brightness temperature was converted nh@xmath28   ( 1,1 ) column densities .",
    "the upper level columns of the inversion line can be derived via the following relation :    @xmath77    @xcite where @xmath78 is given in units of @xmath79 , the frequency @xmath80 in ghz , the main beam brightness temperature @xmath81 in k , and the velocity @xmath82 in km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the upper and lower levels of each inversion line are almost evenly populated due to the small energy difference .",
    "we therefore double each upper level population to arrive at the total , upper and lower population for each line .    the dynamic range of the map spans more than 2 orders of magnitude with the sgrb2 molecular cloud being exceptionally bright .",
    "in fact , the interferometric map around sgrb2 shows a very steep gradient with a decline in brightness by a factor of @xmath46 within a radius of only 5pc ( for a more detailed discussion of the profile see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "part of the steep decline , however , might be due to the missing short spacings which filters out very extended emission ( sect.[sec : obs ] ) .",
    "single dish maps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show extremely bright and extended emission , so the short spacing filtering effect is substantial in this region and we detect only the local peaks of the emission . toward the positions of sgrb2 ( m ) and",
    "( n ) at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , the ultra  compact hiiregions ( see also fig.[fig : m0][b ] ) are bright enough in the radio continuum to yield ammonia absorption instead of emission .",
    "this explains the two holes on top of this region .",
    "very striking features are the two molecular arcs in between sgrb2 and a galactic longitude of @xmath85 .",
    "the molecular arcs appear to be symmetric with the symmetry axis slightly below the zero galactic latitude line at @xmath86 ; one arc spanning up to @xmath87 and the other up to @xmath88 ( outlined by a dashed and dotted line in fig.[fig : vel ] ) .",
    "if they are coherent features , they have lengths of @xmath89 which corresponds to @xmath90pc .",
    "they are mostly coincident with the dusty ring detected as a cold structure in _ herschel _ temperature maps by @xcite ( see also sect.[sec : arcs ] ) .",
    "one of the brightest clumps being part of the molecular arcs is the brick g0.253 + 0.016 at @xmath91 .",
    "it is a high density , compact molecular clump with an integrated brightness temperature of @xmath92kkm  s@xmath23  that could be the formation site of a massive star cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sightline toward sgra * is relatively weak with a temperature - velocity integral of @xmath93kkm  s@xmath23 . at distances of @xmath94 from sgra",
    "* however , we do see surrounding emission from the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) , a feature that is also prominent in lines of other molecules such as hcn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see sect.[sec : cnd ] for details ) .    toward negative galactic longitudes ,",
    "the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud at @xmath95 is one of the strongest features in our map and it splits into three almost parallel filaments with lengths of @xmath96 or @xmath97pc .",
    "the two at higher @xmath47 are with 110 - 130kkm  s@xmath23  very similar in integrated brightness , whereas the one at lower @xmath47 is somewhat weaker with 80 - 100kkm  s@xmath23 .    in between the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud and the molecular arcs is the region where the massive arches and quintuplet clusters reside ( see sect.[sec : clusters ] ) . in that part of the cmz , the molecular arcs intersect in projection , giving way to a somewhat rounder , shell - like structure .",
    "this structure is located near to a large cloud that is elongated perpendicular to the galactic plane in the vicinity of the non - thermal radio continuum arc ( sect.[sec : cont ] ) . from there , two molecular features are visible that form a `` @xmath98 '' shape and merge close to the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud .",
    "binning three channels to velocity widths of @xmath99 km  s@xmath23 , the channel maps of the ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion line emission are displayed in figs.[fig : chann11 ] and [ fig : chann22 ] , respectively .",
    "as expected , the nh@xmath28  ( 2,2 ) emission is generally somewhat fainter but very similar in structure to the ( 1,1 ) emission . given the dynamic range of the data ( see sect.[sec : m0 ] ) , we display the maps in logarithmic units . at low velocities , the tip of the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud as well as the molecular arc at @xmath100 are visible ( see also fig.[fig : m0 ] ) .",
    "the southern molecular arc breaks up into clouds at velocities @xmath10120 km  s@xmath23  and @xmath102 km  s@xmath23  and is therefore not as coherent in velocity space as the northern one .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that this arc does not have many cloud components in the intermediate velocity range at @xmath103 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the molecular gas at @xmath104 is in the velocity range of @xmath105 km  s@xmath23with an additional component at @xmath106 to @xmath107 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the intensity  weighted velocity map ( moment 1 ; fig.[fig : vel ] ) indicates a very similar velocity structure in the @xmath108 region and the arc structure at negative @xmath47 values between sgra * and sgrb2 .",
    "note that emission at negative velocities is relatively weak and thus the intensity  weighted velocity map displayed in fig.[fig : vel](b ) is biased toward larger values .    in fig.[fig : pv ] we show a position  velocity map of the entire data cube .",
    "the greyscale is the peak intensity determined along @xmath47 . in this plot",
    "the velocity difference between the different molecular arcs becomes apparent again , with a maximum separation of @xmath109 km  s@xmath23  and an indication that the tips of the arcs arrive at similar velocities after a smooth velocity difference decrease .",
    "the mean velocity of sgrb2 is about @xmath110 km  s@xmath23  and absorption of ammonia toward sgra * is at @xmath111 km  s@xmath23 . despite local deviations ,",
    "a trend can be observed for velocities to decrease from large @xmath45 toward sgra*. this trend may be extended to the other directions .",
    "the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud , for example , is closer to sgra * than the 50 km  s@xmath23  cloud which itself is closer to the center of the galaxy than sgrb2 at 70 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the velocity decline toward sgra * may indicate streaming motions along the central bar of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or an x@xmath112 orbit along the a 100pc dust ring described by @xcite ( see also sect.[sec : arcs ] ) . in the first case , if we take the angle of the galactic bar with respect to the sun ",

    "this corresponds to an average velocity gradient of @xmath115 km  s@xmath23pc@xmath23 .",

    "if sgrb2 is on the 100pc ring ( see sect.[sec : arcs ] ) , it will take @xmath117myr to reach a position that is aligned in projection with sgra*.    the linewidths of the ammonia emission are in the range of 20 - 40 km  s@xmath23 without significant differences toward individual regions ( see table[tab : pos ] ) . in fig.[fig : m0 ] we show the 2@xmath118 moment of the ammonia ( 1,1 ) data cube .",
    "the very large values in this map , however , are at positions with multiple line components and do not reflect the true velocity dispersions of the ammonia distribution .",
    "one of the main goals of this survey is to derive a temperature map of the region between sgra * and sgrb2 .",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , the ratio of the upper level populations @xmath119 for two different inversion lines , ( @xmath120,@xmath120 ) and ( @xmath29,@xmath29 ) , can be expressed by a rotational temperature @xmath121 .",

    "most of the kinetic gas temperatures , in particular in the molecular arcs between sgra * and sgrb2 are relatively uniform at @xmath46k for smaller clouds and about @xmath103k for the larger molecular complexes . hotter molecular gas with temperatures of @xmath137k are found towards clouds in the vicinity of sgra * and in the sgrb2 region .",
    "in particular , across sgrb2 a temperature gradient is visible with temperatures exceeding 80k at high galactic latitude and longitude , and much colder temperatures of @xmath46k at lower galactic latitudes and longitudes .",
    "first indications for this gradient have been described in the literature e.g. in @xcite or @xcite , but the gradient was never imaged in this lucidity before .",

    "for our @xmath152 cases this amounts to @xmath153 .",
    "changes to the temperature , however , are minimal and the correction factors cancel out ( eq.[eq : t ] ) when the optical depths for the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are identical .",
    "this is in fact a good assumption since the average temperatures of the gas is at @xmath154k ( see sect.[sec : temp ] , see also sect.[sec : tmap ] ) , which is in between the energies above ground for the ( 1,1 ) [ @xmath155k ] and ( 2,2 ) [ @xmath156k ] levels , respectively . in the unlikely edge cases where one of the transitions is optically thin and the other exhibits @xmath157 , any temperature corrections would also be close to a factor of @xmath158 , with colder temperatures for higher optical depths of the ( 1,1 ) line .",
    "in fig.[fig : scuba ] we show ammonia ( 1,1 ) column density contours overlaid on a scuba 850@xmath15 m map .",
    "the absolute flux of the scuba data is somewhat uncertain due to the chopping technique used ( see * ? ? ? * for a description of the original data ) and should be treated as a lower limit since extended flux is likely filtered out . as mentioned in sect.[sec : mos ] , our interferometric ammonia measurements suffer from similar problems and a short spacing correction with single dish data would be required to recover the entire flux of the region .",
    "therefore , on large scales , the comparison of extended emission in both maps will not be very reliable .",
    "on more compact scales , on which this paper focuses , however , the data can be compared and the ammonia ( 1,1 ) column densities and the scuba 850@xmath15 m data trace each other extremely well .",
    "all features , except for sgra * and the ammonia absorption against the compact hii  regions sgrb2(n ) and ( m ) are reproduced in both datasets .",
    "sgra * is dominated by non  thermal emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is therefore unrelated to dusty molecular gas .    to determine the validity of a dust  to  gas relationship between ammonia and the scuba 850@xmath15 m data , we determined both fluxes in each pixel ( 4  in size ) after smoothing to a common resolution of 30 . following this , we binned the distribution of the pixels in the nh@xmath28  ( 1,1 ) column density versus the scuba 850@xmath15 m fluxes in order to obtain a point density distribution of these values .",
    "the logarithmically scaled point density distribution is shown in fig.[fig : dustgas ] .",
    "the tip of the contours ( largest values in dust and gas ) follow an almost linear relation as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the line , however , is not centered on the origin of the plot but shifted along the scuba 850@xmath15 m axis .",
    "this offset may be the result of the missing large scale flux of both maps .",
    "however , if the 850@xmath15 m flux is underestimated , the line would shift even further away from the origin on this axis . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is mainly the interferometric ammonia measurements where we miss flux , the graph would shift up and could be brought in agreement with starting at the origin .",
    "but such a shift would be extreme as a correction of @xmath159@xmath79 is required , a value that would almost double the column density for an average cloud ( taking account missing scuba flux will increase the difference even further ) .",
    "temperature variations of gas and dust are unlikely to have a significant effect on the slope of the plot , but could broaden the distribution .",
    "we also corrected for the temperature and calculated _ total _ ammonia column densities from the ( 1,1 ) line and the temperature ( via the eq .",
    "a15 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as listed in table[tab",
    ": derived ] , the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) populations are together about half of the total ammonia column density that we derive from our data .",
    "a comparison with the entire ammonia column density thus leads to a very similar plot as the one shown in fig.[fig : dustgas ] and it does not contain a substantial additive component .",
    "in addition , 850@xmath15 m dust fluxes are not exceedingly susceptible to variations in temperature .",
    "the offset of the line may thus be due to a large amount of missing flux from extended emission mainly of the nh@xmath28(1,1 ) line . a different explanation for the offset would be that the ammonia forms on dust grains which also shields the material and that a minimum of dust is required to produce ammonia efficiently and to protect it against destruction through the surrounding uv radiation field ( see also the discussion in * ?",
    "in contrast to the scuba maps , the radio continuum emission and the molecular gas as traced by ammonia show little coincidence . only the star forming region",
    "sgrb2 exhibits radio continuum emission from the hii  regions at the same positions where large amounts of molecular gas are found ( see fig.[fig : m0 ] ) . for this region",
    "it is obvious that the molecular gas most likely feeds the current star forming activity . as already noted by @xcite ,",
    "there is much less molecular gas in the star forming sgrb1 region at @xmath160 .",
    "this may indicate that the sgrb1 region is more evolved than sgrb2 and that the remaining molecular gas has already been dispersed .",
    "in addition , the non - thermal radio arcs at @xmath161 also occupy a region with only little ammonia line emission .",
    "the pistol / sickle region at @xmath162 , for example , exhibits nh@xmath28(1,1 ) column densities of only @xmath163@xmath79 .",
    "in addition , at larger galactic latitudes , the radio arc bifurcates into two roughly parallel components at @xmath164 and @xmath165 . along the filaments , the nh@xmath28(1,1 ) column densities are @xmath166@xmath79 , whereas the column density in the very thin , long area in between the two filaments rises up to @xmath167@xmath79 . the radio emission in",
    "the two arched thermal filaments that connect to the main non - thermal arcs and that stretch from @xmath168 to @xmath169 and from @xmath170 to @xmath171 are also in regions with low nh@xmath28  average column densities . toward lower galactic latitude and lower galactic longitudes ,",
    "however , very prominent molecular gas clumps are apparent in the integrated intensity maps ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig : m0 ] ) .",
    "a notable exception to this behavior is the `` handle '' of the pistol / sickle , the radio filament that extends roughly perpendicular to the large non - thermal radio arcs at galactic latitudes of @xmath172 .",
    "molecular gas appears to be aligned with this feature and exhibits column densities of @xmath173@xmath79 .",
    "finally , the region around sgra * with the associated mini ",
    "spiral is also very bright in 1.2 cm radio continuum emission but has only weak features of molecular gas .",
    "in particular , the very prominent circumnuclear , molecular ring around sgra * , which is very bright in hcn @xcite , is not exceptionally strong in the nh@xmath28(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions ( see sect.[sec : cnd ] ) . the ammonia feature has a somewhat larger diameter than that of hcn and column densities of @xmath174@xmath79 .",
    "this is up to an order of magnitude less than the column densities in the 20 and 50 km  s@xmath23clouds .",
    "the more isolated radio continuum regions at @xmath175 and @xmath176 also show local peaks in the ammonia distribution of a few @xmath177@xmath79 .",
    "associated star formation may thus be in a relatively early stage .",
    "some of the most prominent features in the interferometric ammonia map ( fig.[fig : m0 ] ) are the two molecular arcs west of sgr b2 , between @xmath178  and @xmath179 .",
    "the two galactic northern and southern arcs are almost symmetric in shape , mirrored along a line at constant @xmath180 .",
    "the northern arc is certainly much brighter than the low - b counterpart . in fig.[fig : scuba](c ) we show an overlay of the ammonia to _",
    "8@xmath15 m data .",
    "some of the detected gas corresponds very well to strong absorption features in the infrared images .",
    "in particular the northern arc is heavily absorbing the infrared emission whereas the southern arc is hardly visible in the _ spitzer _ image at all .",
    "similarly , the string of molecular clouds north of sgr a * are less absorbing than those south of sgra * , namely the 20 and 50 km  s@xmath23  clouds .",
    "this can be interpreted such that the northern arc and the clouds south of sgra * are in front of most of the ir emission whereas the southern arc and the clouds north of sgra * are located behind .",
    "the different structures are indicated by the sinusoidal solid ( back structure ) and dashed ( front ) lines in fig.[fig : vel](b ) ( also in fig.[fig : pv ] ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with the morphology of the `` figure 8 '' 100pc ring that was recently detected in a _",
    "herschel _ temperature map by @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the dust ring and our ammonia arcs are very similar and the ammonia may thus be emitted by clumps residing in the dust ring .",
    "@xcite claim that the ring is rotating , based on single dish data of the cs molecule .",
    "our data is filtering out the diffuse emission and the clumps seem to follow a somewhat different picture . whereas the @xcite interpretation suggests that the foreground arc east of sgr a * should be redshifted compared to the background arc",
    ", we find the opposite . in fig.[fig",
    ": pv ] the northern , foreground arc ( dashed line ) , is at lower velocities compared the foreground arc ( solid line ) .",
    "the velocities of the two arcs are less distinct toward sgr b2 and at the position of the non - thermal arcs at about @xmath181 .",
    "this indicates that the structure might be described by an expansion with a velocity of @xmath182 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "signatures for an expansion were also detected in previous co measurements by @xcite , albeit at much larger expansion velocities .",
    "a comparison of our ammonia data with the intensity - weighted n@xmath112h@xmath183 map presented in @xcite corroborates the view gained on the basis of the ammonia data alone , i.e. it appears to contradict the rotating ring picture .",
    "our map , unfortunately , does not cover the region between sgra * and sgrc , which contains the other half of the 100pc ring at @xmath184 .      due to the filtering effect of the atca interferometer , we derive the temperature distribution of molecular clumps more or less directly , with little contribution from diffuse inter - clump gas . in fig.[fig :",
    "tkinnh](a ) , we show the kinetic temperature distribution of all pixels in our map . the distribution peaks at about 38k and has a fwhm of 43k , spanning the 18 - 61k range .",
    "we derive very few areas with a lower limit of kinetic temperatures of @xmath185k .",
    "previous studies have detected high temperature components in the galactic center molecular gas using single dish telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is very likely that the hot material is mostly diffuse and filtered out by our interferometric observations in combination with that our ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are not sensitive to high temperatures .",
    "this pronounces the clumpier material which is substantially colder on average .    from fig.[fig : tkin](b ) we may see a trend that smaller clumps exhibit colder temperatures .",
    "a different view is shown in fig.[fig : tkinnh ] where we plot the logarithm of the total ammonia column density ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec : scuba ] ) to the derived kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "the pixel by pixel correlation has been binned and logarithmic contours are shown .",
    "the plot confirms that gas at higher column density also tends to show a higher temperature .",
    "if the heating is external , one would expect it to affect clouds of all sizes to similar depths .",
    "smaller clumps would thus be more thoroughly heated whereas larger clumps would be able to maintain a colder inner core . since we see the opposite , we may assume that most of the gas heating takes place internal to the individual clumps .",
    "if the star formation rate per molecular gas mass is roughly constant , larger clumps will contain more proto - stars , in particular more massive proto - stars .",
    "those stars are the most likely candidates for internal heating .",
    "we hardly detect massive clumps with very low temperatures , or small clumps with large temperatures .",
    "small clumps that do contain massive proto - stars may in fact dissipate relatively quickly , eluding their observation .    the galactic center , however , is known to contain external heating sources such as cosmic rays , shocks , a strong uv field , x - ray sources , and dust . as explained above , most of the heating in the clumps is likely internal .",
    "but in some places the external heating may play a significant role , even for the smaller clumps .",
    "notably , this includes the bow - shaped region from the thermal , arched filaments , through the high column density 50 km  s@xmath23  and 20 km  s@xmath23  clouds , in addition to the compact and dense sgr b2 region which exhibits a strong temperature gradient ( both traced by the yellow and red spots in fig.[fig : tkin][a ] ) .",
    "the bow - shaped region is close to sgra*. although the cnd is cooler ( see sect.[sec : cnd ] ) , the warmer gas may be influenced by activity of sgra * , which may cause larger x - ray and cosmic ray fluxes , as well as shocks .",
    "pdr effects may play a major role in the `` mini - starburst '' sgrb2 , which is also a place where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbits of the central stellar bar intersect .",
    "the resulting shocks might be an additional heating mechanism for the molecular gas in that area and can potentially explain the sgrb2 temperature gradient that is hotter at larger galactic longitude values .      besides the sgrb regions , young stellar clusters are visible all across the cmz .",
    "two of the most prominent , massive clusters are the arches @xmath186 and the quintuplet @xmath187 clusters displayed in fig.[fig : clusters ] .",
    "the clusters have masses of @xmath188m@xmath19  and are with ages of @xmath158myr for the arches and @xmath50myr for the quintuple cluster @xcite relatively young .",
    "the different ages may also be reflected in the dense gas map .",
    "close to the arches cluster , a large filament of dense molecular gas extends roughly parallel to the non  thermal radio continuum filament .",
    "the immediate surroundings of the quintuplet cluster , however , are relatively clear of ammonia and may have dispersed over the lifetime of this cluster .",
    " color composite map of the region in fig.[fig : clusters ] shows how different the distributions of the gas tracers are .",
    "co emission @xcite is brightest closer in the direction to the galactic center and only little is visible in a roughly circular region that is defined by the radio arcs , the pistol / sickle and the thermal arched radio filaments that extend from the non - thermal arc to smaller galactic longitudes .",
    "this region can be roughly described by a circle centered on @xmath189 and having a diameter of @xmath190 ( indicated by the cyan circle in fig.[fig : vel][b ] ) .",
    "the region , almost entirely surrounded by radio continuum emission appears to be filled with [ ] @xmath191 emitting gas ( rest frequency : 492.161ghz ; data from * ? ? ?",
    "[ ] is a well  known tracer for photo  dissociation regions ( pdr ) and this indicates that the gas is mainly ionized within this cavity .",
    "this is supported by the detection of fek@xmath192 6.4kev emission in the region @xcite .",
    "the gas traced by ammonia is scattered all across that area .",
    "the main filaments , however , are close to the radio continuum emission toward the inside of the region .",
    "the two stellar clusters are also at the inner edge of the radio continuum emission . the ammonia channel maps ( fig.[fig : chann11 ] ) at this position show signatures that may be interpreted as an expanding structure but the relative velocities could well be due to other motions , too .",
    "if it is expanding , the driving force could be provided by the gas traced by [ ] .",
    "this scenario would also explain why the morphology and kinematics of the nh@xmath28  emission does not follow the overall sinusoidal pattern that is prominently observed by the molecular arcs between the shell ( cyan circle in fig.[fig : vel][b ] ) and sgrb2 , which is continued south and north of sgra * ( sect.[sec : arcs ] ) .",
    "the presence of strong [ ] emission also indicates pdr conditions and hence a higher ionizing flux and , since the [ ] emission is widespread , a higher temperature .",
    "the temperature map of ammonia ( fig.[fig : tkin ] ) , however , shows values of @xmath193k which are only slightly enhanced compared to other , more quiet regions of the mapped area .",
    "the denser gas therefore appears to be well  shielded against heating from ionizing flux .",
    "if the picture of an expanding shell structure holds true , the distribution of the different gas tracers may thus indicate that dense gas forms a boundary layer that is filled with ionized and pdr gas ( see also the discussion in sect.[sec : filaments ] ) .",
    "the dense gas layer is also where the arches and quintuplet clusters are located .",
    "the radio continuum is emitted in an additional sheet surrounding the dense gas that takes the role of the interface to the unaffected ism .",
    "substructures are observed close to the stellar clusters and within the radio continuum emission .",
    "the more immediate environment of the quintuplet cluster is relatively devoid of ammonia emission but has a local peak in [ ] .",
    "it also shows radio continuum emission aligned with the outer part of the structure .",
    "this emission forms the pistol / sickle region .",
    "the situation is less clear for the gas in the immediate surroundings of the arches cluster .",
    "the arches appears to be located on the rim of a cavity , that is centered on @xmath194 and filled with pdr gas . since warm , ionized gas follows the path of least resistance , it may originate from the arches cluster but then accumulate in this substructure .",
    "the circumnuclear disk around sgra * is the most central position in our milky way at which substantial amounts of molecular gas are detected .",
    "the ring has been mapped in various dense molecular tracers , like hcn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and shows a characteristic diameter of an arcminute ( or about 3pc ) with a total mass of @xmath195m@xmath19  stored in various clumps @xcite . a temperature map with nh@xmath28(1,1 ) column density contours",

    ", we are able to detect the most likely connection of the cnd with the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud and possibly the 50 km  s@xmath23  cloud ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud has a velocity gradient and at the position where it connects to the cnd , the value is about @xmath196 km  s@xmath23(see fig.[fig : cnd ] ) . from this level",
    ", the values roughly decrease in a clockwise direction around the cnd .",
    "this indicates that gas is fed from the 20 km  s@xmath23  to the cnd .",
    "given that the cnd is only @xmath55pc away from the supermassive black hole sgra * , it is surprisingly cold .",
    "we detect kinetic temperatures between 25k in the clumps and a maximum of @xmath110k in some inter - clump regions .",
    "our values are much lower than single dish measurements that derive a few hundred k for two regions of the cnd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this could indicate that the cnd is composed of clumpy cold and diffuse hot material as we are not sensitive to extended emission .",
    "the temperature structure of the clumps in the cnd is not significantly different from regions further away , e.g. in the molecular arcs ( sect.[sec : arcs ] ) . as seen in fig.[fig : tkin ] , the temperatures of the cnd are also lower than those in a the warmer bow - shaped region described in sect.[sec : temp ] . cooling and shielding appears to be more efficient in the cnd , if the higher surrounding temperatures are caused by sgra*.",
    "we observed the region between the supermassive black hole sgra * and the massive star forming region sgrb2 in our milky way with the atca in the ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines ( @xmath197 ; @xmath198 ) .",
    "the interferometric data filters the clumpy structure that otherwise blends with a more diffuse component in single dish observations . we find",
    "the following :    * the dense gas is distributed in many filamentary structures with two prominent molecular arcs between sgra * and sgrb2 .",
    "the dense molecular arcs are likely located on the 100 pc ring that was recently detected in _",
    "herschel _ dust temperature maps . * except for the extreme sgrb2 region , the 1.2 cm radio continuum and ammonia emission are almost anti - coincident .",
    "this includes the continuum emitted from sgrb1 , the non - thermal arcs , the arched , thermal filaments , as well as the mini - spiral around sgra*. * scuba 850@xmath199 data trace the dense ammonia gas very well , in an almost linear relationship .",
    "we see possible indications that a minimum amount of dust may be required for substantial amounts of ammonia to form and survive the encompassing uv radiation field . *",
    "a map of kinetic temperatures is constructed that is reasonably accurate in the 10 - 80k range .",
    "for some of the gas , in particular gas close to sgrb2 and in the vicinity of the 20 and 50 km  s@xmath23  clouds and the arched , thermal filaments , we derive a lower limit of @xmath185k for the kinetic temperature . *",
    "the peak of the kinetic temperature distribution is at @xmath200k with a fwhm that spans 18 - 61k . on average ,",

    "the dominating heating mechanism is thus likely internal , and possible sources could be proto - stars . *",
    "the molecular gas for the circumnuclear disk immediately surrounding sgra * with a radius of @xmath55pc is likely being supplied by the 20 km  s@xmath23  cloud .",

    "the region close to the arches and quintuplet clusters shows signs for a layered structure with more diffuse pdr gas that is surrounded by dense ammonia clumps .",
    "furthermore , the radio continuum filaments form an outer layer .",
    "the galactic center is an energetic region and understanding the dense gas clumps is key to understanding star formation in extreme conditions .",
    "the difference of the diffuse and dense gas components can be revealed by additional single dish observations .",
    "finally it will be desirable to observe higher transitions over the full cmz to obtain a map of a larger range of temperatures .",
    "for example , the nh@xmath28(2,2 ) line has an energy of @xmath201k above ground , but the ( 3,3 ) , ( 6,6 ) and ( 9,9 ) levels are at @xmath202k , @xmath203k , and @xmath204k , respectively , and therefore trace much warmer gas .",
    "other temperature tracers can be used to calibrate all methods against each other .",
    "the cmz is also an important benchmark for comparisons with other galactic nuclei , near and far , active and quiet .",
    "understanding the details of heating and cooling , star formation , agn feedback and gas transfer in the nearby cmz is therefore indispensable to understand the role of nuclear regions for galaxy evolution at all cosmic epochs .",
