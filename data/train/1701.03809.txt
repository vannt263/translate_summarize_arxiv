    "one of the most challenging problems in the field of post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which still continues to intrigue and perplex astronomers , is the mechanism responsible for the formation of complex morphologies .",
    "it is known from optical and near  infrared ( ir ) imaging surveys that the majority of post - agb stars and pne show an aspherical geometry ( elliptical , bipolar , multi  polar ; manchado et al .",
    "1996 , 2011 ; parker et al . 2006",
    "; boumis et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; sahai et al . 2011 ; sabin et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "post - agb stars represent the phase of stellar evolution where the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) has not expanded enough to become optically thin and , thus , observations in the optical are impeded .",
    "these cses are very thick due to the large amount of mass ejected during the agb phase ( 10@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 ; bujarrabal et al .",
    "the central stars evolve towards higher effective temperatures , reappearing again in the optical range as a consequence of the dilution of the cse on a time - scale that is mainly dependent on the initial mass of the progenitor star ( blcker 1995 ) .",
    "however , the rapid evolution of the most massive post - agb stars does not provide enough time for the cse to expand and become optically thin .",
    "evidence of this evolutionary path is provided by young pne whose very thick envelopes result in extremely high internal extinctions that prevent their detection in the optical range ( ramos - larios et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the pn phase , on the other hand , is the consequent result of the interaction between stellar winds from low  intermediate mass stars ( 18 @xmath7 ) during the agb and post - agb phases .",
    "the star is hot and luminous enough to ionize the gas , resulting in the formation of a colourful nebula .",
    "this complex structure around the central star undergoes spectacular changes in the structure and geometry during the transition from the agb to the post - agb , and , finally , to the pne phase .",
    "optical and ir imaging surveys of post - agb stars have also revealed very complex cses , with a wide variety of shapes and forms ( e.g.  trammell et al .",
    "1994 ; meixner et al . 1999 ; ueta et al .",
    "2000 ; gledhill et al . 2001 ; gledhill 2005 ; parthasarathy et al .",
    "2005 ; lagadec et al .",
    "it is suggested that the spherical symmetry of the agb stellar wind breaks somewhere between the very late agb mass  loss phase ( trammell et al .",
    "1994 ) and the early post - agb phase ( gledhill et al . 2001 )",
    ". however , the exact mechanism responsible for this deviation is still poorly known ( see e.g. balick & frank 2002 and reference therein ) .",
    "the presence of an equatorial density enhancement , such as a disk or torus around these stars , has been credibly proposed by several authors to be the mechanism responsible for the formation of aspherical pne ( e.g. livio & soker 1988 ; soker & livio 1994 ; soker 2002 ; frank & blackman 2004 among others ) . to enable the formation of highly collimated , fast  moving jets or outflows , a large amount of orbiting mass is needed , in accordance to the magnetohydrodynamic model of frank & blackman ( 2004 ) .",
    "this mass can be provided through the mass  exchange interaction of close binary systems ( e.g. soker & livio 1994 ; rasio & livio 1996 ; see also the review by de marco 2009 ) .",
    "the presence of these dusty circumstellar disks has been confirmed in some proto  pne ( ppne ) with highly collimated outflows such as m  29 ( lykou et al . 2011 ) , mz3 ( chesneau et al . 2007 ) , red rectangle and 89  her ( bujarrabal et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "the presence of such a large amount of dust in cses results in : ( i ) a large near  ir excess in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( e.g. de ruyter et al . 2006 ) , and ( ii ) the production of significant amount of linear polarization due to stellar light scattering by large ( @xmath21  @xmath8 m ) or small ( @xmath90.2  @xmath8 m ) dust grains , and free electrons . the grains size may be responsible for the different wavelength dependences of polarization ( gledhill & yates 2003 ) .",
    "cses have been found to be richer in small grains .",
    "optical and near  ir polarization imaging along with spectro ",
    "polarimetric observations have become very powerful techniques for investigating dust properties ( i.e. distribution and composition ) , as well as the geometry of cses around agb and post - agb stars ( e.g. johnson & jones 1991 ; parthasarathy et al .",
    "2005 ; ueta et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 , 2007 ; meixner et al .",
    "2000 ; gledhill et al . 2001 ; gledhill 2005 ) .    studying the polarization characteristics of several stars from the red giant to the pne phase ,",
    "johnson & jones ( 1991 ) concluded that the degree of polarization increases through the transition from the agb to the post - agb phase , and decreases again at the pne phase .",
    "this result implies that a spherically symmetric agb wind may break somewhere between the late agb mass  loss and early post - agb phases , whereas the dust formation and mass  loss rates are relatively high ( soker 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , the expansion of cses over time leads to a gradually decrease of dust density and results in a lower degree of polarization .",
    "lpez & hiriart ( 2011a & 2011b ) reported a linear relation between the degree of polarization and the mass  loss rate in evolved carbon stars .",
    "based on polarimetric images of post - agb and ppne with nicmos on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    ", gledhill et al . (",
    "2001 ) claimed that the degree of linear polarization is strongly related to the light scattered from disk  like structures , oriented at different inclination angles .",
    "later , ueta et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 ) proposed that besides the effect of orientation , the optical depth is also a crucial parameter that reflects the polarization characteristics of duplex ( dust  prominent longitudinally extended ; elliptical ppne ) and sole ( star  obvious low  level elongated ; toroidal ppne ) nebulae , in agreement with the theoretical predictions of radiative transfer models ( ueta & meixner 2003 ) .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 1978 ) derived a general expression for the linear polarization in optically thin cses around binary systems , providing a method that allows us to determine the geometric characteristics of these cses from the observed stokes parameters .",
    "posterior investigation of the effect of multi - scattering polarization in axisymmetric geometries , such as equatorial disks , ellipsoidal envelopes and polar jets , has shown that multi  scattering results in a higher degree of polarization than single scattering in cses with high optical depths ( wood et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "finally , a more comprehensive study on the effect of multi  scattering in circumstellar disks around binary stars was performed by hoffman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present new optical broad  band and multi  band ( _ u , v , b , r _ and _ i _ ) linear aperture polarimetric measurements of a sample of 53 post - agb stars , out of which 24 ( or 45% ) are presented for the first time . the remaining 29 sources ( 55% )",
    "have been already observed either in the optical or near - ir wavelengths .",
    "based on the degree of polarization in the _ v_-band , we classify the programme stars from unpolarized to highly polarized .",
    "this study follows the same technique conducted by bieging et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and lopez & hiriart ( 2011a ) to identify possible correlations between the degree of polarization with near - ir colour indices .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present the selection criteria of our sample , while the observations and data analysis are described in section 3 .",
    "our results and distinct comments on each programme star are presented in section 4 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 and we wrap up with the conclusions in section 6 . it is noteworthy that the current paper is the first out of a sequence focusing on the optical polarimetric data .",
    "furthermore , new near  ir ( _ j , h , k _ ) polarimetric observations will also be obtained and presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a sample of 53 post - agb stars was selected from de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the toru catalogue of galactic post - agb and relative objects ( szczerba et al .",
    "2007 , 2012 ) by applying the following criteria to all the programme stars : ( i ) they exhibit a near  ir excess in their sed profiles , which may be associated with the thermal emission of hot dust grains ( evans 1985 ) and provides a signature of a dusty circumstellar disk / torus ( de ruyter et al .",
    "2006 ) ; and ii ) they are bright enough at optical wavelengths to perform accurate linear polarimetry from the 0.84  m telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional in sierra de san pedro mrtir , mexico . in table [ table1 ] , we list for the stars of our sample , their coordinates , their classification type and information about their binarity .",
    "our sample consists of 29 post - agb or likely post - agb stars ( three ppne : red rectangle , frosty leo and minkowski footprint ) , 23 rv tauri stars and one yellow hypergiant star ( yhg ) .",
    "in particular , the rv tauri stars define a subgroup of pulsating post - agb stars whose iras fluxes are located in a specific area of the iras colour  colour diagram , known as the rv tauri box ( 1.0@xmath10$]@xmath11<$]1.55 & 0.2 @xmath12$]@xmath13 < $ ] 1.0 ; evans 1985 ) . among the 53 objects , seven are known binary systems with a range of orbital periods between 100 and 1000  d ( see de ruyter et al .",
    "2006 for more details ) , 15 are candidate binary systems , and 6 are confirmed single stars ."
