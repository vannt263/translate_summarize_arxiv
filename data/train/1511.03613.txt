    "over the last two decades , babcock - leighton ( bl ) dynamo models have emerged as a leading paradigm for explaining the origin of the solar activity cycle @xcite .",
    "the defining characteristic of bl models is the critical role of magnetic flux emergence and dispersal in the operation of the dynamo .",
    "emerging flux structures appear in the solar photosphere as bipolar magnetic regions ( bmrs ) with systematic orientations such that the trailing flux ( in the sense of rotational motion ) is displaced poleward relative to the leading flux @xcite .",
    "the subsequent evolution of this flux in response to differential rotation , meridional circulation , and convection , generates a mean poloidal field that can ultimately reverse the sun s dipole moment , at least at the surface ( see  [ sec : flagship ] ) .",
    "the preferential tilt of bmrs is known as joy s law and this process of poloidal field generation is known as the babcock - leighton ( bl ) mechanism .",
    "most current bl dynamo models may also be classified as flux transport dynamo ( ftd ) models in which the meridional circulation ( mc ) regulates the cycle period @xcite .",
    "the equatorward migration of toroidal flux inferred from the solar butterfly diagram (  [ sec : flagship ] ) is attributed to an equatorward flow of 2 - 3 m s@xmath2 near the base of the convection zone ( cz ) where the progenitor flux for bmrs is thought to originate .",
    "though this presumed equatorward flow at the base of the cz has not yet been detected , it has long been inferred based on the observed poleward circulation in the upper cz and the constraint of mass conservation .",
    "recent photospheric observations and helioseismic inversions have called into question this simple single - celled picture of the mc @xcite .",
    "however , ftd models are still viable as long as the circulation at the base of the cz is equatorward and convection contributes to the transport of poloidal flux across the cz @xcite .",
    "both conditions are supported by theory and global convection simulations , even when the overall mc profile is multi - cellular @xcite .",
    "the bl mechanism has a solid empirical grounding ; we observe it operating in the solar photosphere as bmrs continually emerge and disperse .",
    "the amount of flux emerging is more than enough to reverse the polar fields , at least at the surface , and there is evidence that the strength of the following cycle is correlated with the bl poloidal source term and with the strength of the sun s polar fields during cycle minimum , as predicted @xcite .",
    "other observed solar cycle features that are well reproduced by bl / ftd models include the equatorward migration of toroidal flux ( solar butterfly diagram ) , the phase relationship between toroidal and poloidal fields , the phase coherence across grand minima , and the flux budget in active regions @xcite .",
    "though global mhd simulations of convective dynamos have made great strides in recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they still can not capture the full multi - scale complexity of flux emergence and the bl mechanism .",
    "until they do , hybrid approaches are necessary to model the solar cycle with maximum fidelity .",
    "we describe one such hybrid approach here .",
    "we call it the stable ( surface flux transport and babcock - leighton ) solar dynamo model .",
    "stable is an ftd model but unlike most previous ftd models that only address the axisymmetric ( 2d ) magnetic field components , stable is fully 3d .",
    "so , it can capture the 11-year solar cycle as well as the explicit distortion and dispersal of photospheric bmrs that underlies the bl mechanism .",
    "the latter capability in effect makes stable a 3d generalization of 2d ( latitude / longitude ) surface flux transport ( sft ) models , which have had notable success in capturing the observed evolution of photospheric fields @xcite .",
    "a 3d , kinematic ftd / sft model similar to stable was recently described by @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite describe a somewhat different approach to unifying sft models and ftd models based on retaining the 2d nature of each class of model and coupling them , so that each model provides the source term that sustains the other .",
    "there have also been a few 3d mean - field dynamo models based on a turbulent @xmath3-effect as opposed to the bl mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main advantages of the 3d approach over 2d ftd models is the potential for a more realistic depiction of flux emergence . though we acknowledge that this potential has not yet been fully realized , substantial progress in this direction has been made by @xcite who employ a kinematic flow that lifts and twists toroidal magnetic fields , mimicking the effects of magnetic buoyancy . in the future",
    "we will implement this and other flux emergence algorithms into stable .",
    "another promising reason to develop a 3d ftd model is the potential for data assimilation ( da ) .",
    "if solar dynamo models are to be used for the prediction of future solar activity , they must assimilate observational data .",
    "if the model is axisymmetric , this data assimilation typically makes use of the mean radial magnetic field at the surface of the sun as a function of latitude and time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is effectively 1d da .",
    "however , sft models can exploit the observations more fully , assimilating the full observed radial magnetic field as a function of latitude , longitude and time ( 2d da ; see references above ) .",
    "thus , sft models are able to model the time - evolving surface magnetic field of the sun with more fidelity . however , since they are not dynamo models , their predictive potential is relatively short - term , spanning less than a decade .",
    "stable will be capable of assimilating complete 2d magnetograms ( 2d da ) for use with both short - term and long - term solar activity forecasting .",
    "the 2d surface fields will also provide boundary conditions for corona and heliosphere models .",
    "there are many other reasons for developing a 3d , nonlinear , mhd ftd model .",
    "another is turbulent transport .",
    "the 3d formulation will allow us to replace turbulent diffusion and magnetic pumping with 3d convective flow fields either computed self - consistently or derived from observations .",
    "it will also allow us to capture magneto - shear instabilities in the solar tachocline which may induce non - axisymmetric patterns in flux emergence and may contribute to poloidal field generation via an @xmath3-effect @xcite .",
    "other sources of non - axisymmetric activity include converging flows into active regions @xcite and longitudinal variations in the meridional circulation .",
    "first results from stable were reported by @xcite , hereafter md14 . in this paper",
    "we describe stable in somewhat more detail and consider the operation of the dynamo for the special case when the imposed flow fields are kinematic and axisymmetric . in this case",
    "the mean ( axisymmetric ) induction equation decouples from the non - axisymmetric components and behaves essentially as a 2d ftd model .",
    "this serves to verify the model and to provide a baseline for future simulations that will include non - axisymmetric flows and lorentz - force feedbacks . after describing the formulation of the model in ",

    "we close by summarizing our main results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the stable model solves the kinematic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) induction equation in a 3d , rotating , spherical shell : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the velocity and magnetic field in the rotating reference frame and @xmath7 is a turbulent diffusion .",
    "this equation is solved by means of the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code , which currently serves as the _ dynamical core _ for the stable model .",
    "ash is a well established , parallel , mhd code that has been used extensively to study convection , instabilities , tachocline confinement , and other aspects of solar and stellar internal dynamics @xcite . for the initial stages of stable development , we have modified ash to operate in a kinematic regime ( the full mhd system will be considered in future work ) .",

    "the mean ( longitudinally - averaged ) induction equation for the stable model is equivalent to a 2d ftd model when @xmath5 is axisymmetric and kinematic .",
    "this allows us to make contact with previous 2d ftd models in the literature before moving on to more general 3d , nonlinear flow fields .",

    "though the spotmaker algorithm (  [ sec : spotmaker ] ) is distinct from previous representations of the bl mechanism in the literature , one could in principle devise an axisymmetric source term that is equivalent from the perspective of the mean fields .",
    "thus , in terms of the evolution of the mean fields , the models presented here are similar to the 2d ftd models presented by @xcite and @xcite , who used an axisymmetric spot deposition algorithm . however , unlike 2d ftd models , stable also provides the corresponding time evolution of the 2d ( latitude / longitude ) surface field .    in order to build on previous work , we specify @xmath21 and @xmath7 as in previous ftd models . in particular , the @xmath22 profile is taken from @xcite @xmath23 \\left(\\omega_s(\\theta ) - \\omega_c\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 here we use @xmath26 = 432.8 nhz , @xmath27 = 460.7 nhz , @xmath28 - 62.9 nhz , @xmath29 = -67.13 nhz , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the solar radius .",

    "so , it should be regarded as a conservative upper limit of flux depletion .    to highlight this point further ,",
    "we go back to the orginal configuration of an axisymmetric toroidal flux tube with flux @xmath130 .",

    "thus , it is more meaningful to consider the ratio of toroidal to poloidal field , as argued by @xcite . for all of our cases",
    "this ratio is similar , at about 85 - 88 ( see table 1 ) . scaling down @xmath117 to achieve a mean polar field strength of about 10 g",

    "[ fig : spotmaker]@xmath15 ) , lower @xmath191 did yield supercritical solutions , even for @xmath120 ; see cases l2 and l3 in table 1 .",
    "the benefit of lower diffusion is demonstrated unambiguously by comparing cases l1 and l2 , which both use the same lognormal emergence pdf .",
    "the benefit of more frequent bmr emergence is demonstrated unambiguously by comparing cases s8 and l2 .    @xmath33 but for cases ( @xmath33 ) l2 and ( @xmath14 ) l3 , spanning a century of simulated time .",
    "saturation values for the color table are @xmath174 50 g and @xmath174 200 g respectively .",
    "[ fig : bflies ] ]    the difference in dynamo efficiency influences not only the growth or decay rate of the dynamo , but also the nonlinear saturation level .",
    "this is demonstrated most dramatically by case l3 ( table 1 ) .",
    "this case has all the features that were shown above to be beneficial , including deep penetration of bmrs , wide spacing of bmr polarity components , low diffusion , and frequent bmr emergence , with a mean interval between spot appearances of @xmath234 day and a mode of @xmath235 days ( table 1 ) .",
    "even though it has the same quenching field strength as all the other cases , @xmath118 g , and a relatively low flux amplification factor of @xmath120 , it achieves stronger fields ( more magnetic energy ) than all of the other cases .",
    "this includes case s1 ( discussed in ",
    "[ sec : flagship ] ) , which has @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , though cases l2 and l3 have the same value of @xmath119 , the latter has much stronger fields .",
    "it also has a higher ratio of @xmath236 , approaching unity .",
    "this can be attributed to the large value of @xmath233 , which maximizes the mean poloidal field associated with each bmr because the two polarities have minimal overlap in latitude .",
    "but for case l3 .",
    "the saturation level for the color table is @xmath174 1 kg . [ fig : ss2 ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : metoo]@xmath14 shows me@xmath173 in cases s8 , l1 , l2 , and l3 for comparison .",
    "all were started from the same initial conditions , obtained from the supercritical case s4 ( table 1 ) .",
    "note that case l2 in particular has more magnetic energy than its progenitor , s4 ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that lowering the diffusion by a factor of three more than makes up for lowering @xmath119 by a factor of two .",
    "though the two supercritical cases in this plot , l2 and l3 , look somewhat irregular at early times , they both settle into a steady magnetic cycle similar to that described in  [ sec : flagship ] for case s1 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bflies ] . the most apparent difference between these two cases ( figs .",
    "[ fig : bflies]@xmath33,@xmath14 ) is that case l3 ( @xmath14 ) has a smoother distribution of low - latitude poloidal flux .",
    "this can be attributed to the more frequent bmr emergence rate , which yields more flux patches at any given time .",
    "furthermore , the lower diffusion in both cases l2 and l3 relative to case s1 leads to stronger , more compact fields at low latitudes that more closely track the emergence sites ; compare fig .",
    "[ fig : bflies ] with figs .",
    "[ fig : scalar]@xmath14 and [ fig : bfly]@xmath33 .",
    "the stronger , more compact fields at low latitudes in case l3 relative to case s1 is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss2 ] .",
    "compare this to fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] .",
    "each individual spot of a bmr takes longer to disperse so at any given time , there are more spots that are strong and localized .",
    "the flux distribution in case l2 ( not shown ) is similar . yet , this change in the flux distribution has little effect on the overall characteristics of the magnetic cycles .",
    "the cycle period in all three cases is similar : 13.1 years for s1 and l3 , and 13.6 years in l2 .",
    "the other supercritical solution , case s4 , has a cycle period of 13.0 years .",
    "though a detailed comparison with observations lies outside the scope of this paper , we note that a cursory comparison of our simulations with solar magnetograms and sft models suggests that cases l2 and l3 produce more realistic surface flux distributions . their lower diffusion and higher frequency of emergence events tends to produce strong flux patches with a wider range of areas that extends below 5 square degrees , reminiscent of observed magnetograms @xcite .    as discussed in",
    "[ sec : fluxdep ] , the spotmaker algorithm effectively assumes that only a small portion of a progenitor toroidal loop emerges through the surface so the depletion of mean flux is minimal . in reality",
    ", a significant portion of the mean flux in the lower cz / tachocline would be redistributed throughout the cz and outside of the domain .",
    "taking this tachocline flux depletion into account would likely inhibit the dynamo ; it is unclear whether or not supercritical solutions could still be found for @xmath237 .",
    "it would also reduce the ratio of mean toroidal to poloidal field .",
    "these issues are indeed important to investigate but they are subtle , and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have described a novel 3d babcock - leighton / flux transport solar dynamo model and we have presented some initial results for axisymmetric , kinematic flow fields .",
    "these initial results provide a baseline for subsequent studies that will incorporate 3d flow fields and lorentz - force feedbacks .",
    "the name of the new model is stable , reflecting its close ties to both surface flux transport models ( st ) and ( a ) babcock - leighton ( ble ) dynamo models .",
    "the use of kinematic , axisymmetric flow fields implies that the evolution of mean fields reduces to an equivalent 2d ftd model , though there is no explicit @xmath3-effect (  [ sec : stable ] ) . instead",
    ", poloidal field is generated by the bl mechanism in response to the spontaneous appearance of bmrs , as in the 2d ftd model of @xcite .",
    "our model is also similar to the 3d ftd model of @xcite , although they use a more sophisticated flux emergence algorithm based on imposed rising , helical , flow fields .",
    "we plan to implement a similar algorithm in the future .",
    "until then , the current bmr deposition approach may be regarded as the limit in which emergent toroidal flux structures decouple quickly from their roots in the deep cz . in order to verify the stable model (  [ sec : verification ] ) , we provisionally replaced this bmr deposition algorithm with an axisymmetric bl source term and we were able to reproduce the 2d ftd benchmark cs@xmath157 defined by @xcite .",
    "the stable model exhibits many promising features that are in good agreement with solar observations . like other ftd models",
    ", it sustains regular magnetic cycles with equatorward propagation of toroidal flux at low to mid latitudes near the base of the cz .",
    "however , unlike many other mean - field and convective dynamo models , there is no need to use this subsurface toroidal flux as a proxy for sunspot number .",
    "instead , sunspots / bmrs appear at the surface of the stable model explicitly and , in the special case of axisymmetric flow fields , can be tracked by means of the non - axisymmetric component of the magnetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the radial magnetic field at the surface is similar to sft models , with the distortion and dispersal of low - latitude , tilted bmrs by dr , mc , and turbulent diffusion producing high - latitude , axisymmetric bands of poloidal flux that migrate poleward and eventually reverse the polar fields .",
    "this process is essential for the operation of the dynamo .    as in other ftd models , the period and amplitude of the magnetic cycles",
    "are largely determined by the meridional flow speed and the quenching of the poloidal source ( through the @xmath117 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) ) .",
    "however , other parameters do play a significant role . for example , though the mc and @xmath117 are the same in all simulations presented here ( with the exception of the benchmark in  [ sec : verification ] ) , the total magnetic energy produced by the dynamo can vary by more than two orders of magnitude ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the cycle period is less sensitive to the bmr structure , emergence rate , and diffusion , but it can still vary significantly , from 13.0 years in case s4 to 13.6 years in case l2 .",
    "factors that influence the dynamo efficiency include the emergence rate and penetration depth of bmrs , and the spacing between the two polarity components of a bmr .",
    "poloidal field generation is more efficient if each bmr is wider and deeper , and if the number of bmrs is increased by increasing the frequency of emergence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spotmaker]@xmath15 ) .",
    "lower diffusion also enhances the dynamo efficiency and makes the distribution of radial flux at the surface more intermittent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ss2 ] ) .",
    "any of these factors can make the difference between a subcritical and supercritical solution (  [ sec : supercritical ] ) .",
    "one deficiency of the model in its current state is the long time it takes for residual flux from mid - latitude bmrs to migrate poleward and reverse the polar fields ( figs .",
    "[ fig : bfly ] and [ fig : bflies ] ) .",
    "this does not agree well with solar observations , both in terms of the migration speed and the phasing between low - latitude toroidal flux as traced by sunspots and high - latitude polar field reversals .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : overview ] , this is likely due to a relatively low speed for the high - latitude meridional flow and will be addressed in future versions of stable .",
    "other features of the model can also be calibrated to improve agreement with solar observations , including the time lag pdf of fig .",
    "[ fig : spotmaker]@xmath15 , which may depend on the phase of the cycle .    boundary conditions appear to be important for the solar dynamo .",
    "in particular , it is clear from solar observations that substantial magnetic flux passes through the surface of the sun and that the shearing of this poloidal flux by the surface dr generates toroidal flux in each hemisphere by means of the @xmath22-effect .",
    "cs15 argue that this is the dominant source of mean toroidal flux in the sun and can account for all the flux that emerges in bmrs .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case for our ftd models .",
    "however , we find that the role of turbulent diffusion is somewhat different than that envisioned by cs15 (  [ sec : cs ] ) .",
    "they modeled turbulent diffusion as an effective drag term that inhibited the generation of net toroidal flux in each hemisphere @xmath221 .",
    "we find instead that it promotes the generation of net flux by selectively dissipating residual oppositely - signed flux from the previous cycle .",
    "thus , instead of inducing a negative phase shift in @xmath221 as argued by cs15 , we find that diffusion induces a positive phase shift , causing the maxima and reversals in @xmath221 to occur later than they would without diffusion .",
    "future model developments will include flux transport and amplification from 3d convective flow fields , lorentz force feedbacks , and flows induced by enhanced radiative cooling in active regions , which is expected to play a significant role in dynamo saturation .",
    "these developments may produce non - asymmetric dynamo modes , magneto - shear instabilities , and torsional oscillations that will be explored in future papers .",
    "furthermore , we intend to explore the sft aspects of stable and its potential for forecasting future magnetic activity by assimilating data from photospheric magnetograms .",
    "we believe this class of 3d bl / ftd models shows great promise as a `` solar dynamo frontier '' .",
