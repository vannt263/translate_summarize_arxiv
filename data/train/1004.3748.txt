    "entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which quantum systems exhibit correlations above and beyond what is classically possible . as such it is a crucial resource for many aspects of quantum information processing including quantum computation , quantum cryptography and communications , and quantum metrology @xcite . due to",
    "its fundamental , and increasingly practical , importance there is a growing body of literature dedicated to studies of entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , many aspects of entanglement , especially multi - partite entanglement and its evolution , are in need of further exploration @xcite .",
    "the unavoidable degradation of entanglement due to decoherence has severely hampered experimental attempts to realize quantum information protocols .",
    "decoherence is a result of unwanted interactions between the system of interest and its environment .",
    "highly entangled , and thus highly non - classical , states may be severely corrupted by decoherence @xcite .",
    "this is especially troubling as these states tend to be the most potentially useful for quantum information protocols .",
    "an extreme manifestation of the detrimental effects of decoherence on entanglement is entanglement suddent death ( esd ) : in which decoherence causes a complete loss of entanglement in a finite time @xcite despite the fact that the system coherence goes to zero only asymptotically .",
    "much has been written about this aspect of entanglement for bi - partite systems and there have been several initial experimental studies of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "fewer studies look at esd , and specifically esd with respect to multi - partite entanglement , in multi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "a class of two qubit states that are generally known to exhibit esd are the so called @xmath0-states @xcite , so named due to the pattern of non - zero density matrix elements .",
    "these states play an important role in a number of physical systems @xcite , and allow for easy calculation of certain entanglement measures . in this paper ,",
    "i explore the entanglement dynamics of three qubit @xmath0-states in dephasing and depolarizing environments as a function of decoherence strength .",
    "previous studies of three qubit @xmath0-shaped states utilize more restrictive sets of states : ghz - diagonal states @xcite and generalized ghz - diagonal states @xcite .",
    "other papers have examined specific examples of three qubit @xmath0-state entanglement including the effects of dephasing on a three - qubit quantum error correction protocol @xcite .    to quantify entanglement within the three qubit systems i utilize the negativity , @xmath1 , defined as the most negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the density matrix @xcite with respect to qubit @xmath2 .",
    "this provides three distinct entanglement measures . as a pure tri - partite entanglement metric for mixed states",
    "i will use the tri - partite negativity , @xmath3 which is simply the third root of the product of the negativities with respect to each of three qubits @xcite , @xmath4 .",
    "a mixed state with non - zero @xmath3 is distillable to a ghz state .",
    "it is important to note the existence of bound entanglement which may be present even if all negativity measures in a three qubit system are equal to zero .",
    "thus , when i refer to esd of a state with respect to given negativity metrics this should not be confused with separability of the state .",
    "nevertheless , besides general interest in the behavior of these entanglement metrics , the disappearance of negativity plays an important role in quantum information protocols in that it indicates that the entanglement of the state is not distillable .    the physical significance of @xmath0-states mentioned above demands and efficient means of experimentally determining the presence of entanglement .",
    "this can be accomplished via ` entanglement witnesses . '",
    "three qubit states can be separated into four broad categories : separable ( in all three qubits ) , biseparable , and there exist two types of locally inequivalent tri - partite entanglement ( ghz and w - type ) @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite provides a similar classification schemes for mixed states each of which includes within it the previous classes .",
    "these are separable ( s ) states , bi - separable ( b ) states , w states , and ghz states , which encompasses the complete set of three qubit states .",
    "entanglement witnesses are used to determine in which class a given state belongs .",
    "these observables give a positive or zero expectation value for all states of a given class and negative expectation values for at least one state in a higher ( _ i.e. _  more inclusive ) class .",
    "i will make use of specific entanglement witnesses @xcite that will identify whether a state is in the ghz@xmath5w class ( _ i.e. _  a state in the ghz class but not in the w class ) , in which case the state has experimentally observable ghz - type tri - partite entanglement .",
    "though the use of entanglement witness can not guarantee that entanglement is not present , it does give experimental bounds on whether the entanglement can be observed .",
    "the results presented in this paper are ( i ) the analytical determination of various negativity measures for @xmath0-states of an arbitrary number of qubits including how the negativity evolves under decoherence , ( ii ) the demonstration that negativity disappears in finite time for @xmath0-states subject to different types of decoherence and the ( analytical and numerical ) determination of the decoherence strength when this occurs , ( iii ) the analytical calculation of the expectation value of @xmath0-states undergoing decoherence with respect to appropriate entanglement witnesses , ( iv ) the demonstration of the sudden appearance , only at non - zero decoherence strength , in some @xmath0-states of the tri - partite negativity , and ( v ) the calculation of a bound on the three qubit concurrence for @xmath0-states and the description of how this can be extended to more qubits . in addition , i prove in the appendix that the set of generalized ghz - diagonal states do not cover all possible @xmath0-states .",
    "there are a number of classes of three qubit states whose entanglement properties have been studied and whose non - zero density matrix elements form an @xmath0 shape : @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the most basic is a pure three qubit ghz state with wavefunction @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a three bit binary number between zero and seven and @xmath10 is the result of flipping each bit of @xmath9 .",
    "the density matrix of this state is @xmath11 .",
    "mixed states that are diagonal in the basis of these eight states form the set of ghz - diagonal states studied in @xcite .",

    ". the density matrix elements of these states are thus @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a generalized ghz state is a non - maximally entangled state of the form : @xmath16 the density matrix of this state is @xmath17 for @xmath7 .",
    "an incoherent mixture of generalized ghz states where @xmath9 now ranges from 0 to 7 ( as opposed to 0 to 3 used in in @xcite ) form a generalized ghz - diagonal state .",
    "these states are studied in @xcite and have the form : @xmath18 for these states the density matrix elements are as follows : @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . however , as shown in the appendix , generalized ghz - diagonal states do not include all possible @xmath0-states .",
    "this is due to the restriction of constant @xmath22 and @xmath23 for all contributing generalized ghz states .    in this paper",
    "i consider @xmath0-states that are completely general , limited only by the restriction that the state is a proper density matrix . for convenience",
    ", i will refer to the four density matrix elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the x - state as a ghz - type state . at",
    "most , four ghz - type states contribute to each three qubit @xmath0-state .",
    "an @xmath0-state is a mixed state that can be written as a sum of ghz - type states .",
    "when a partial trace is taken over any one of the three qubits of an @xmath0-state the resulting two qubit matrix is diagonal .",
    "this demonstrates that the entanglement of an @xmath0-state is either tri - partite or biseparable but not completely separable . before calculating any specific entanglement metric and studying its decay in a given decohering environment",
    ", we note that an upper bound on the entanglement decay was derived in @xcite for a number of different decohering environments . though these bounds were calculated for the more limited generalized ghz - diagonal states they appear to be appropriate to the states studied in this work .",
    "however , these upper bounds go to zero only in the limit of complete decoherence .",
    "thus , the states never exhibit entanglement sudden death for any entanglement metric and the bounds can not be used to study the esd phenomenon .",
    "below , i explore specific entanglement metrics for which i provide analytical solutions to exactly calculate the decoherence strength at which the @xmath0-states exhibit esd for the given entanglement metrics .",
    "while esd of these metrics can not guarantee separability of the @xmath0-state it does provide important information concerning distillability and the ability to determine the presence of entanglement .    to calculate the negativity of a three qubit @xmath0-state we take the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix with respect to one of the qubits .",
    "these 24 eigenvalues ( 8 for each possible partial transpose ) are all of the form : @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from these eigenvalues",
    "one can see how the negativity detects the entanglement of an @xmath0-state .",
    "let us first assume a ghz - type state with the only non - zero elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalues which utilize elements @xmath29 and @xmath30 can not be negative ( since @xmath31 and @xmath32 for all @xmath28 )",

    "@xmath0-states that are sums of two ghz type states have non - zero elements @xmath34 .",
    "such states will again have negative eigenvalues @xmath35 , @xmath33 and two additional possibly negative eigenvalues @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . as more density matrix elements of the @xmath0-state are filled up",
    "the eigenvalues tend to have the form of these latter two eigenvalues .",
    "we now look at the entanglement evolution of the three qubit @xmath0-states with no interaction between the qubits , in an independent qubit dephasing environment noting the exhibition of esd with respect to the negativity .",
    "the independent qubit dephasing environment is fully described by the kraus operators @xmath39 where the dephasing parameter @xmath40 can also be written in a time - dependent fashion , @xmath41 .",
    "when all three qubits undergo dephasing we have eight kraus operators each of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the effect of a dephasing environment of strength @xmath40 on an @xmath0-state is to reduce the anti - diagonal elements of the density matrix by a factor @xmath45 while leaving the diagonal elements constant . to calculate the negativity we look at the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-state after taking the partial transpose with respect to the desired subsystem .",
    "the relevant eigenvalues are now of the form : @xmath46 the eigenvalues go to zero when : @xmath47 based on the above , it is easy to see that esd with respect to negativity is not exhibited by @xmath0-states made up of single ghz - type states ( with non - zero elements @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) : the negativity with respect to any one qubit , and thus the tri - partite negativity as well , is simply @xmath50 .",

    "in addition , the two negative eigenvalues that constitute @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shown ( dotted lines ) neither of these go to zero in finite time .",

    "what is important is that the witnesses detect purely tri - partite entanglement that does not include biseparable but not completely separable entanglement .",
    "i now look at an independent qubit depolarizing environment and , as above , explore the entanglement evolution of the three qubit @xmath0-states .",
    "the kraus operators for this environment are : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the pauli spin operators , @xmath70 and @xmath40 is now the depolarizing strength .",

    "as @xmath40 increases further , the state exhibits esd with respect to all single qubit negativities and @xmath3 ( and @xmath53 ) becomes positive .",
    "this sort of @xmath3 behavior indicates that there is only a small region of decoherence strengths ( which does not include @xmath80 ) for which we can be sure there exists ghz - distillable entanglement .",
    "such behavior , going from positive to negative and back , can not occur when the @xmath0-state is composed of only two ghz - type states .",
    "this is because two of the single qubit negativites are equal , the partial trace with respect to two of the qubits give the same set of eigenvalues .",
    "the sign of @xmath3 is thus determined solely by the eigenvalues of the partially transposed state with respect to the third qubit .",

    "in addition , i explored the detection capability of entanglement witnesses sensitive to tri - partite entanglement .",
    "as with the negativity , the expectation value of the @xmath0-state with respect to the entanglement witness can be solved analytically and are vital in assessing potential experimental studies .",
    "these results are extended to systems made of arbitrary numbers of qubits .",
    "finally , i analytically solved for the relevant terms of a lower bound on the three - qubit concurrence for an @xmath0-state , demonstrated when it goes to zero in dephasing and depolarizing environments .",
    "this method may be useful for calculating concurrences for larger numbers of qubits .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank g. gilbert and s. pappas for helpful feedback and acknowledge support from the mitre innovation program under mip grant # 20msr053 .",
    "as mentioned in the main part of the paper , a previously studied set of states with an @xmath0 shaped density matrix is the generalized ghz - diagonal states @xcite . in this appendix",
    "i prove that generalized ghz - diagonal states do not include all possible x - states by constructing an explicit state with an x - shaped density matrix that is not part of the aforementioned set .",
    "generalized ghz - diagonal states with @xmath144 qubits have the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the hilbert space dimension .",
    "the density matrix elements of these states using the notation of eq .",
    "[ xstate ] are as follows : @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath151 or @xmath152 : :     +    if either of these is true then all other @xmath153 for    @xmath154 must also equal zero .",
    "@xmath155 _ and _ @xmath156 : :     +    if this is true    @xmath157    and    @xmath158    where @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , if in addition @xmath160 ( which would require    @xmath161 ) ,    @xmath29 must equal zero . @xmath162 : :     +    let @xmath163 where    @xmath164 are real",
    ". then the fraction    @xmath165 . as mentioned in the main part of the paper , the    coefficients @xmath166 are all real forcing    @xmath167 to be real and    @xmath168 for all integers @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath169 and @xmath170    must both be purely real or purely imaginary .",
    "we can now explicitly construct a two qubit @xmath0-state that is not part of the set of generalized ghz - diagonal states by setting @xmath171 and violating each of the three conditions listed above .",
    "such a state can have the form : @xmath172 where @xmath164 are real and @xmath173 guarantees the density matrix has positive eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , @xmath174 must be trace 1 , @xmath175 , and its purity must be @xmath176 .    in eq .",
    "[ vstate ] @xmath171 , yet @xmath177 , indicating that @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath179 while @xmath180 does not , indicating that @xmath181 and @xmath182 can not both be true .",
    "finally , @xmath183 need not be real nor purely imaginary indicating that @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the state @xmath174 is not part of the set of generalized ghz - diagonal states though it certainly is an @xmath0-state .",
