    "in networked control systems , the communication between sensors , controllers and actuators is accomplished through a shared digital communication network .",
    "there are several aspects of such networks which put severe constraints on the available data rates . in the first place ,",
    "the digital nature of the communication channels puts a limit on the number of bits that can be transmitted reliably in one unit of time .",
    "this naturally leads to the problem of determining the smallest channel capacity or bit rate above which a certain control objective such as stabilization can be achieved .",
    "numerous authors have studied this problem both in deterministic and stochastic setups , for a variety of control objectives , under different assumptions on the network topologies and on the coding and control policies , see , e.g. , the papers @xcite , the monographs @xcite and the survey papers @xcite . in many of these works , expressions or estimates of the critical capacities in terms of dynamical entropies or lyapunov exponents",
    "have been obtained . in practice , there are always unknown parameters in the system under consideration .",
    "therefore , one important issue is the robustness of the critical bit rates under variation of system parameters .",
    "since both entropy and lyapunov exponents as functions of the dynamical system are known to have jump discontinuities , one can not expect that critical bit rates behave robustly without appropriate assumptions on the system under consideration . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this issue so far has only been addressed in @xcite for state estimation objectives . in the paper at hand , we identify a setup in which the desired robustness property is satisfied for the problem of practical stabilization ( i.e. , set - invariance ) . the paper @xcite introduced the notion of topological feedback entropy as a measure for the smallest rate of information above which a compact subset of the state space can be rendered invariant by a controller which receives the state information via a noiseless discrete channel . an equivalent notion , called invariance entropy , was introduced in @xcite . the monograph @xcite presents the foundations of a theory which aims at a characterization of invariance entropy in terms of dynamical quantities such as lyapunov exponents and escape rates .",
    "this works particularly well under the assumption that the subset to be stabilized has a uniformly hyperbolic structure .",
    "in fact , for a uniformly hyperbolic chain control set of a control - affine system , the paper @xcite provides a closed expression of the invariance entropy in terms of lyapunov exponents .",
    "uniformly hyperbolic chain control sets are also known to vary continuously in the hausdorff metric under variation of system parameters , cf .",
    "we use these results to prove that the invariance entropy of a uniformly hyperbolic chain control set varies continuously with respect to system parameters .",
    "uniformly hyperbolic chain control sets arise around hyperbolic equilibrium points when the control range is sufficiently small and certain regularity assumptions are satisfied ( as , e.g. , controllability of the linearization at the equilibrium ) . in @xcite",
    "an example of a stirred tank reactor is studied , where this happens .",
    "a large class of algebraic examples for uniformly hyperbolic chain control sets was identified in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_prelim ] , we give a review of control - affine systems , additive cocycles , concepts of semicontinuity and the shadowing property of uniformly hyperbolic systems . in section [ sec_datarate ] , we provide a new justification that the invariance entropy is a measure for the smallest data rate above which a set can be rendered invariant by a symbolic coding and control scheme . section [ sec_spectra ] studies semicontinuity properties of spectral sets for additive and subadditive cocycles over control flows of parametrized control - affine systems .",
    "finally , we prove our main result about the continuity of the invariance entropy on a uniformly hyperbolic chain control set in section [ sec_mainres ] . here",
    "we essentially use the following three facts : the property of uniform hyperbolicity is robust under @xmath0-perturbations , the invariance entropy of a uniformly hyperbolic chain control set can be expressed as the infimum of the morse spectrum of an additive cocycle and , by the results of section [ sec_spectra ] , this infimum depends continuously on parameters .",

    "<S> in this paper we address the question of robustness of critical bit rates for the stabilization of networked control systems over digital communication channels . for a deterministic nonlinear system , </S>",
    "<S> the smallest bit rate above which practical stabilization ( in the sense of set - invariance ) can be achieved is measured by the invariance entropy of the system . under the assumptions of chain controllability and a uniformly hyperbolic structure on the set of interest , we prove that the invariance entropy varies continuously with respect to system parameters . hence , in this case the critical bit rate is robust with respect to small perturbations .    </S>",
