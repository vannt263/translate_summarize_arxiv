    "an electron released from an atom or molecule and further on steered in the field of the parent ion by intense laser fields gives rise to many fundamental phenomena @xcite .",
    "for instance , the field driven electron - ion recombination results in the emission of coherent radiation with frequencies which are odd integer multiples of the carrier frequency of exciting pulse , a phenomenon known as the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) process . over the last two decades",
    ", hhg has been intensively studied experimentally and theoretically ( see , e.g. , review articles @xcite and references therein ) , owing to its powerful application to the generation of coherent xuv laser pulses down to the attosecond regime @xcite .    in principle",
    ", high harmonics can be generated by transitions among excited bound electronic states as well as by the involvement of unbound continuum electronic states .",
    "detailed calculations on an array of quantum dots with only bound discrete electronic states have demonstrated an efficient hhg @xcite .",
    "however , as the current experiments on atoms and molecules are performed in the strong - field ionization regime , below we concentrate on this regime . here , the essential mechanism behind the hhg process is explained within the simplified three - step model @xcite , in which an electron : ( i ) escapes from the potential formed by the superposition of the ionic core and linearly - polarized laser field potentials ; ( ii ) is accelerated back to the parent ion during the next half - cycle of the driving pulse ; and ( iii ) recombines with the ion emitting thereby high - energy photons .",
    "the validity of this illustrative model has been confirmed by numerous theoretical studies of hhg process in atoms and molecules performed within the single - active - electron ( sae ) approximation ( for recent results see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the role of inactive electrons , which are kept frozen within the sae approximation , is not negligible for the strong - field processes .",
    "however , exact numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for many - electron systems in laser fields is very formidable task . at present , it has been realized only for he atom @xcite to calculate single- and double - electron multi - photon ionization rates .",
    "the method of full dimensional numerical integration of tdse for two electrons , developed in these works , utilizes a basis set of coupled spherical harmonics @xcite , and it is particularly efficient to study strong - field problems which can be described by implying very small radial grids of about 100  bohr .",
    "there are several theoretical studies of hhg process performed beyond the sae approximation in atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for instance , proposes generalization of the three - step model for many - electron systems by introducing perturbative corrections due to exchange and electron correlations . a more consistent tracking of electron correlations and dynamics is provided by the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree - fock ( mctdhf ) method @xcite .",
    "its straightforward implementation to the solution of the strong - field problems is , however , a challenging computational task @xcite . in order to be able to study hhg by mctdhf method in realistic systems",
    ", one can either lower dimensionality of the problem @xcite ( i.e. , consider only one or two dimensions for each electron ) , or / and neglect the exchange interaction @xcite ( i.e. , utilize the mctdh method @xcite ) .    alternatively , relaxing the full configuration interaction character of mctdhf by cleverly selecting and incorporating only the important electron correlation and dynamical effects into the ansatz for the wavepacket , one can fully catch the essential physics of the process at hand , and at the same time reduce considerably the numerical effort and thus make the computation tractable .",
    "this can be realized by limiting the space of active electron configurations utilizing , e.g. , the time - dependent restricted - active - space configuration - interaction method ( td - rasci , @xcite ) , the time - dependent generalized - active - space configuration - interaction ( td - gasci , @xcite ) , or the time - dependent restricted - active - space self - consistent - field theory ( td - rasscf , @xcite ) . the latter approach has already been applied to calculate hhg spectra of the 1d beryllium atom @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , we have applied the td - rasci method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the photoionization of he by intense high - frequency laser pulses .",
    "in the present work , we utilize this method to investigate the influence of the correlative electron dynamics on the hhg spectra of this simplest system with two electrons , treated each in three dimensions ( i.e. , we treat here a six dimensional problem ) .",

    ", only essential relevant points are discussed below .",
    "we describe the light - matter interaction in the velocity gauge , which is the most suitable gauge for strong field problems @xcite , since it ensures rapid convergence of the numerical solution over angular momentum of released photoelectrons @xcite . in the electric dipole approximation ,",

    "the corresponding keldysh @xcite parameter @xmath12 indicates that ionization takes place in the intermediate regime between the strong - field tunnel - ionization ( @xmath13 ) and multiphoton ionization ( @xmath14 ) extremes . at the chosen field strength ,",

    "nevertheless , we allow the bound electron to interact with the laser field as well as with the photoelectron , i.e. , it is fully active but kept bound .    to accomplish the above description , we utilized the following symmetrized ansatz for the spatial part of the total two - electron wave function @xmath15 in the singlet spin state : @xmath16\\\\ + \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt { 2}}\\left[\\phi_\\alpha(\\vec{r}_1)\\psi_{\\beta}(\\vec{r}_2,t)+ \\psi_{\\beta}(\\vec{r}_1,t)\\phi_\\alpha(\\vec{r}_2 ) \\right ] .",

    "the extension of the second plateau , which is due to the presence of a second active electron , appears once the basis set contains quantum numbers @xmath58 larger than 1 , and grows fast with additional basis functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the extension of this plateau computed for the largest basis set with @xmath88 does , however , not differ much from that obtained with @xmath89 indicating a noticeable trend in the convergence of the present computational results with respect to the basis set of discrete orbitals .",
    "we stress that the calculations performed here for the largest basis with @xmath88 were already at the limit of our computational capabilities .    as a final point of our study , we ensure that the effect observed here is independent of the time - envelope of the laser pulse employed . for this purpose , we performed an analogous set of calculations using a sine - squared pulse of the same length @xmath90 and intensity @xmath91 ( for details see the last paragraph of the preceding section ) .",
    "the results of these calculations are collected in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hhgsin ] .",
    "the hhg spectrum computed in the sae approximation ( labeled as @xmath65 ) exhibits a main plateau and cutoff which are very similar to those obtained for the trapezoidal pulse in the same approximation ( compare with the lowermost spectrum in the upper panel of this figure ) . from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hhgsin ] one can also see that allowing the bound electron in he to occupy the next layer of orbitals with @xmath86 results in the formation of a second plateau in the computed hhg spectrum . as demonstrated by the calculations which also include the next layer of orbitals with @xmath87 , the second cutoff further moves toward higher photon energies .",
    "generation of high - order harmonics in the he atom exposed to intense linearly - polarized 800 nm laser pulse is studied beyond the single - active - electron approximation by the time - dependent restricted - active - space configuration - interaction method . during the propagation of the two - electron wave packets in strong laser fields",
    ", we allowed only one of the electrons to be ionized and kept the other electron always bound to the nucleus , neglecting thereby the double ionization process which is very weak for the pulse applied . for this purpose ,",
    "the present active space was restricted to configurations which permit only one of the electrons to populate continuum states .",
    "this photoelectron was described in the time - dependent wave packets with angular momenta @xmath49 .",
    "the dynamics of the bound electron was described by a set of selected discrete orbitals @xmath61 of the he@xmath57 ion . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "this discrete one - electron basis was systematically increased by including states with larger quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath59 up to @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the pulse - driven collective correlated dynamics of two electrons in he result in a considerable increase of the number of generated harmonics in the computed hhg spectrum .",
    "in particular , compared to the sae approximation , we observe the formation of a second plateau with weaker harmonics of higher order , which starts at the cutoff of the main plateau and ends with its own cutoff . increasing sequentially the basis set of active orbitals describing the bound electron results in a systematic extension of the second cutoff to the high - energy side . for the presently used pulse parameters",
    ", the computed main plateau extends in the spectrum of harmonics @xmath74 up to @xmath28 of about 100 . for the largest basis set of discrete orbitals used here ,",
    "the second plateau , which is about three orders of magnitude weaker than the main one , consists of additional harmonics with @xmath92 .",
    "taking into account that our calculations are probably still not fully converged over the basis set of discrete orbitals @xmath61 , it is rather difficult to exactly predict the final fate of the second plateau found at higher order harmonics .",
    "nevertheless , the main theoretical conclusion of the present work  that going beyond the sae approximation and allowing more electrons to be active and to interact is important and leads to the generation of considerably more harmonics  will remain unchanged . a full understanding of how two or more active electrons impact the hhg is a rather involved subject and goes much beyond the present work .",
    "nevertheless , we can say already now that having more discrete orbitals implies many more bound states of the two and in other systems possibly more electrons participating in the process",
    ". these bound states alone can also give rise to some hhg @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a realistic model for an array of quantum dots with six active correlated bound electrons has been solved numerically exactly and shown to unambiguously give rise to a second plateau in the hhg spectrum .",
    "although the situation in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from ours , this result supports our finding that allowing more electrons to be active generates higher harmonics and is likely to give rise to a second plateau . in our present example of he ,",
    "the ionization of an electron plays a crucial role , but the existence of the additional bound states certainly leads to additional different pathways of the important ionization channel and this will also influence the hhg . finally ,",
    "after one electron is ionized , the he@xmath57 ion can stay in several excited states .",
    "the recombination step is then also different from that in the sae approximation as there are many new pathways for it now .",
