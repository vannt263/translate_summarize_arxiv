    "in the past decade there has been increasing interest in studying the distributed coordination and control of multi - agent systems , which appear in diverse situations including consensus problems , flocking and formation control  @xcite . as a natural tool , laplacian matrices of a weighted graph ( modeling the interaction among agents )",
    "are extensively used in the study of the distributed coordination problems of multi - agent systems .",
    "most results are based on real laplacians , see , e.g. , the agreement  @xcite , generalized consensus  @xcite and bipartite consensus on signed graphs  @xcite .",
    "very recently , complex laplacians have been applied to multi - agent systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , formation shape control problems in the plane with complex laplacians were discussed in  @xcite , while based on complex laplacians , new methods were developed in  @xcite for the distributed set surrounding design , which contains consensus on complex - valued networks as a special case .",
    "it has been shown that complex laplacians are powerful tools for multi - agent systems and can significantly simplify the analysis once the state space is a plane . from this point , it is worth investigating complex laplacians independently .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the properties of complex laplacians .",
    "more precisely , for a complex - weighted graph , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that the complex laplacian has a simple eigenvalue at zero with a specified eigenvector .",
    "the condition is in terms of connectivity of graphs and features of weights .",
    "it is shown that the notion of _ structural balance _ for complex - weighted graphs plays a critical role for establishing the condition . to demonstrate the importance of the obtained condition",
    ", we apply the condition to consensus problems on complex - weighted graphs . a general notion of consensus , called _ complex consensus _ ,",
    "is introduced , which means that all limiting values of the agents have the same modulus .",
    "some necessary and sufficient conditions for complex consensus are obtained .",
    "these complex consensus results extend and complement some existing ones including the standard consensus results  @xcite and bipartite consensus results  @xcite .",
    "this paper makes the following contributions .",
    "1 ) we extend the known results on complex laplacains ( see  @xcite ) to a general setting .",
    "2 ) we establish general consensus results , which are shown to be useful in the study of distributed coordination of multi - agent systems in the plane such as circular formation and set surrounding control .",
    "in particular , our results supplement the bipartite consensus results in  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in this section we present some interesting results on complex - weighted graphs . we believe that these results themselves are also interesting from the graph theory point of view . before proceeding , we introduce some basic concepts of complex - weighted graphs .      the digraph associated with a complex matrix @xmath21_{n\\times n}$ ] is denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the vertex set and @xmath24 is the edge set .",

    "here a key issue is how to verify the essential nonnegativity of @xmath4 .",
    "thanks to the concept of balancedness of digraphs , we can derive a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath4 to be essentially nonnegative .",
