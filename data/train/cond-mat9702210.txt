    "a corresponding tendency has been detected in finite  temperature lanczos studies @xcite .",
    "in mf  theory the high  temperature enhancement of the low ",

    "it is tempting to relate the behavior depicted in fig .",

    "however , in cugeo@xmath0 the four  spinon continuum is only weakly shifted by temperature and remains more clearly separated from the quasi  elastic line for @xmath102 .",

    "propagator @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting raman spectra show no agreement with experiment . at , present the impact of spinon interaction effects beyond mf  theory on the raman spectra remain unclear .    in conclusion",
    "i have described a finite temperature mf ",
    "theory for frustrated spin  chains and consequently detailed its application to magnetic raman scattering . at low  temperatures , in the gapless phase , i find a scattering continuum which is due to frustration induced four  spinon excitations and is compatible with observed raman spectra of cugeo@xmath0 . in the high  temperature regime",
