    "a number of papers have recently considered the problem of constructing a coherent quantum observer for a quantum system ; e.g. , see @xcite . in the coherent quantum observer problem , a quantum plant",
    "is coupled to a quantum observer which is also a quantum system .",
    "the quantum observer is constructed to be a physically realizable quantum system so that the system variables of the quantum observer converge in some suitable sense to the system variables of the quantum plant . the papers @xcite considered the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a given closed quantum system . in @xcite , the proposed observer is shown to be able to estimate some but not all of the plant variables in a time averaged sense .",
    "also , the paper @xcite shows that a possible experimental implementation of the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system considered in @xcite may be constructed using a non - degenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) which is coupled to a beamsplitter by suitable choice of the ndpa and beamsplitter parameters .",
    "one important limitation of the direct coupled quantum observer results given in @xcite is that both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are closed quantum systems .",
    "this means that it not possible to make an experimental measurement to verify the properties of the quantum observer . in this paper",
    ", we address this difficulty by extending the results of @xcite to allow for the case in which the quantum observer is an open quantum linear system whose output can be monitored using homodyne detection . in this case , it is shown that similar results can be obtained as in @xcite except that now the observer output is subject to a white noise perturbation .",
    "however , by suitably designing the observer , it is shown that the level of this noise perturbation can be made arbitrarily small ( at the expense of slow observer convergence ) .",
    "also , the results of @xcite are extended to show that a possible experimental implementation of the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system may be constructed using a non - degenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) which is coupled to a beamsplitter by suitable choice of the ndpa and beamsplitter parameters . in this case , the ndpa contains an extra field channel as compared to the result in @xcite and this extra channel is used for homodyne detection in the observer .",
    "in this section , we extend the theory of @xcite to the case of a direct coupled quantum observer which is also coupled to a field to enable measurements to be made on the observer . in our proposed direct coupled coherent quantum observer , the quantum plant is a single quantum harmonic oscillator which is a linear quantum system ( e.g. , see @xcite ) described by the non - commutative differential equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the system variable to be estimated by the observer and @xmath2 .",

    "we now describe the linear quantum system which will correspond to the quantum observer ; see also @xcite .",
    "this system is described by a quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is a @xmath10 vector of quantum noises expressed in quadrature form corresponding to the input field for the observer and @xmath11 is the corresponding output field ; e.g. , see @xcite .",

    "the system dynamics ( [ observer ] ) are determined by the observer system hamiltonian and coupling operators which are operators on the underlying hilbert space for the observer . for the quantum observer under consideration ,",
    "this hamiltonian is a self - adjoint operator given by the quadratic form : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a real symmetric matrix .",

    "furthermore , we will assume that the quantum observer is coupled to the quantum plant as shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "in addition , we define a coupling hamiltonian which defines the coupling between the quantum plant and the quantum observer : @xmath27 the augmented quantum linear system consisting of the quantum plant and the quantum observer is then a linear quantum system described by the total hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29,~~ r_a = \\left[\\begin{array}{ll}0 & r_{c } \\\\ r_{c}^t & r_{o } \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] and the coupling operator @xmath19 defined in ( [ wo ] ) . extending the approach used in @xcite",
