    "we look for zeros of higher derivatives instead in accordance with the principle of minimal sensitivity @xcite , i.e.  we determine the variational parameter @xmath85 from solving @xmath217 the solution @xmath218 from ( [ cond ] ) or ( [ condb ] ) yields the variational result @xmath219}{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{+ \\infty }   \\exp \\left [ p^{(n)}\\left (   x',t ; \\kappa^{(n)}_{\\rm opt } ( x',t ) \\right)\\right ] d x'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the probability density .",
    "note that variational perturbation theory does not preserve the normalization of the probability density .",
    "although the perturbative result is still normalized in the usual sense to the respective perturbative order in the coupling constant @xmath16 , this normalization is spoilt by choosing an @xmath0-dependent damping constant @xmath218 .",
    "thus we have to normalize the variational probability density according to ( [ solv ] ) at the end @xcite ( compare the similar situation for the variational ground - state wave function in refs .",
    "+      the variational procedure described in the last section is now applied for determining the time evolution of the probability density in case of the nonlinear drift coefficient ( [ anharm ] ) with @xmath42 . by doing so , the optimization of the variational parameter @xmath85 is performed for each value of the variable @xmath0 at each time @xmath4 .",
    "the result of such a calculation with the parameters @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath146 is shown in figure [ fig : results_par1_anharm ] for the time interval @xmath223 .",
    "figure [ fig : results_par1_anharm ] ( a ) depicts the optimal variational parameter @xmath85 which is the largest solution from ( [ cond ] ) . for small times",
    ", the optimal variational parameter reveals a @xmath224-dependence . for large values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the variational parameter becomes independent of @xmath0 which corresponds to the expectation that the probability density converges towards the stationary one . in figure",
    "[ fig : results_par1_anharm ] ( b ) the respective variational results for the distribution are compared with the cumulant expansion .",
    "the latter shows insofar a wrong behavior as it has two maxima whereas the numerical solution has only one .",
    "the variationally determined probability density is depicted by dots which correspond to the optimal variational parameters in figure [ fig : results_par1_anharm ] ( a ) .",
    "we observe on this scale nearly no deviation between the variational and the numerical distribution , thus already the first - order variational results are quite satisfactory .",
    "+    in order to quantify the quality of our approximation , we introduce the distance between two distributions @xmath3 and @xmath225 at time @xmath4 according to @xmath226 if both distributions are normalized and positive , the maximum value for the distance @xmath227 is @xmath62 and corresponds to the case that the distributions have no overlap . however , if they coincide for all @xmath0 , the distance @xmath227 vanishes .",
    "thus small values of @xmath227 indicate that both distributions are nearly identical . in figure",
    "[ fig : results_par1_anharm ] ( c ) we compare the time evolution of the distance ( [ dist ] ) between the variational distribution and the cumulant expansion from the numerical solution of the corresponding fp equation , respectively .",
    "we observe that the variational optimization leads for all times to better results than the cumulant expansion , both being indistinguishable for very small and large times , as expected .",
    "now we discuss the more complicated problem of a nonlinear drift coefficient ( [ anharm ] ) with @xmath203 .",
    "the corresponding potential ( [ nonpo ] ) has the form of a double well , i.e.  it decreases harmonically for small @xmath0 and becomes positive again for large @xmath0 , so that a stationary solution exists ( see the front of figure [ fig : results_par2_double](b ) ) . strictly speaking , the cumulant expansion developed in section [ ce ] makes no sense for @xmath203 as the unperturbed system @xmath14 does not have a normalizable solution .",
    "this problem is reflected in the time evolution of the cumulant expansion coefficients @xmath201 which are listed in table [ tab : coeff2 ] and depicted in figure [ resultb ] for the order @xmath188 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath42 in ( [ nonv ] ) , the coefficient @xmath229 vanishes for @xmath203 so that the cumulant expansion ( [ kumulant - ansatz])([coeff - chiansatz2 ] ) does not even lead to the correct stationary solution ( [ stat ] ) , ( [ def : nweak ] ) up to first order in @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath199 the only nonvanishing expansion coefficients @xmath197 read @xmath230    0ex    the results of the first - order variational calculation of the probability density are summarized in figure [ fig : results_par2_double ] for the parameters @xmath231 , @xmath74 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath146 . due to the strong nonlinearity",
    ", we could determine the optimal variational parameter @xmath85 from solving ( [ cond ] ) for all @xmath0 and @xmath4 as shown in figure [ fig : results_par2_double ] ( a ) . as expected",
    "the cumulant expansion diverges for larger times @xmath4 as illustrated in figure [ fig : results_par2_double ] ( b ) . despite of this",
    "the variational distribution lies precisely on top of the numerical solutions of the fp equation .",
    "this impressive result is also documented in figure [ fig : results_par2_double](c ) where the cumulant expansion shows for increasing time @xmath4 no overlap with the numerical solution , whereas the distance between the variational and the numerical distribution decreases .",
    "+    even more difficult is the case of a weak nonlinearity where the two minima of the double well are more pronounced .",
    "therefore , the variational calculation has also been performed for the parameter values @xmath234 ,",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath146 . for small times",
    "one obtains again a continuous optimal variational parameter @xmath235 from solving ( [ cond ] ) for all @xmath0 .",
    "however , there exists a critical time @xmath236 beyond which condition ( [ cond ] ) has different solution branches depending on @xmath0 .",
    "in general such a critical point exists , if the equations : @xmath237 _ { \\{x = x_{\\rm crit } , t = t_{\\rm crit } , \\kappa=\\kappa^{(n)}_{\\rm crit}\\ } } = \\begin{pmatrix } 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] have a solution @xmath238 .",
    "for the case at hand we find @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the corresponding surface of zeros and the critical points are depicted in figure  [ critplot ] .    as it remains unclear how these branches should be combined for evaluating the probability density , we resort to zeros of higher derivatives that are continuous for all times . for small values of @xmath4",
    "we find one , two and three continuous zeros for the first , second and third derivative , respectively , as shown in figure  [ fig : zero3t12 ] for @xmath242 .",
    "the smallest zero of the second and third derivative reach a critical point at @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "the larger zeros have continuous solutions for all values of @xmath4 , as shown in figure  [ fig : zero3t17 ] for @xmath245 .",
    "figure  [ fig : plot3c ] shows the distance between variational and cumulant expansion from numerical solution of fp equation for these different branches of zeros .",
    "apparently there is no easy choice of the right branch of zeros , which gives good results at all times .",
    "while @xmath246 gives good results at small times , it fails to approach the stationary solution .",
    "the largest zero @xmath247 of the third derivative on the other hand is unusable for small @xmath4 , but gives good results for later times .",
    "assuming we had no knowledge of the numerical solution , we need to find a way to switch the solution branch from @xmath246 to @xmath247 . in order to determine a suitable time to change the branch of zeros from @xmath248 to @xmath249",
    ", we consider the deviation of the moments of the corresponding distributions @xmath250\\right| d x } { \\int_{-\\infty}^{+ \\infty } \\left| x^n p_{\\rm stat}(x , t)\\right| d x } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : plotmomdiff ] shows the distance for the branches of zeros @xmath251 and @xmath252 for the first three even moments @xmath253 .",
    "we find , that the distributions are in good agreement at @xmath254 , so we choose to combine the solution for @xmath251 for @xmath255 with the solution for @xmath252 for @xmath256 .",
    "the combined result is shown in figure [ fig : results_par3_double_hard ] . the distance ( [ dist ] ) between variational expansion and numerical solution of the fp equation for this case",
    "exhibits a small kink at @xmath254 due to the change in the branch of zeros .",
    "furthermore , in comparison with the other cases in figures [ fig : results_par1_anharm ] and [ fig : results_par2_double ] this distance is relatively large which underlines that this is , indeed , a difficult variational problem .",
    "note , however , that the combined solution succeeds in approaching the stationary solution for large times .",
    "1ex    we remark that the variational approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is related to ours .",
    "in contrast to our method , one obtains there in case of the difficult double well problem @xmath234 , @xmath257 a unique solution of the extremal condition ( [ cond ] ) for all @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , the resulting probability density shows for larger times @xmath4 significant deviations from our , and from numerical solutions of the fp equation .",
    "high - order variational calculations have been performed for the double well with the parameters @xmath231 , @xmath74 , @xmath232 in case of an initially gaussian - distributed probability density peaked at the origin , i.e.  @xmath258 for @xmath259 .",
    "this time was chosen due to its large distance between the variational result and the numerical solution in order to reduce possible errors in the numerical solution .",
    "the order of magnitude of the systematic error of the numerical solution can be estimated by comparing the numerical solution of the harmonic problem , e.g. @xmath14 , with the exact solution that is available for that case .",
    "we find that the error of the numerical solution is about @xmath260 , which is smaller that the pointsize used in figure  [ fig : hodouble ] .",
