    "it is a well known fact that at energies above @xmath0 all hadronic total cross sections rise with the growth of energy . in 1970",
    "the experiments at the serpukhov accelerator revealed that the @xmath1 total cross section increased with energy @xcite .",
    "increase of the @xmath2 total cross section has been discovered at the cern isr @xcite and then the effect of rising @xmath3 total cross sections was confirmed at the fermilab accelerator @xcite and cern @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although nowadays we have in the framework of local quantum field theory a gauge model of strong interactions formulated in terms of the known qcd lagrangian its relations to the so called  soft \" ( interactions at large distances ) hadronic physics are far from desired . in spite of 30 years after the formulation of qcd , we can not still obtain from the qcd lagrangian the answer to the question why and how all hadronic total cross sections grow with energy .",
    "we can not predict total cross sections in an absolute way starting from the fundamental qcd lagrangian as well mainly because it is not a perturbative problem .",
    "the behaviour of hadronic total cross sections at high energies is a wide and much discussed topic in high - ehergy physics community ; see e.g. the proceedings of famous blois workshops . at present time",
    "there are a lot of different models which provide different energy dependencies of hadronic total cross sections at high energies .",
    "all different phenomenological models can conditionally be separated into two groups in according to two forms of strong interaction dynamics used : t - channel form and s - channel one @xcite .",
    "the first group contains the regge - type models with power - like , @xmath5 , behaviour of hadronic total cross sections . here",
    "@xmath6 is an intercept of the supercritical pomerom trajectory : @xmath7 , @xmath8 is responsible for the growth of hadronic cross sections with energy ; see recent paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are a lot of people who works with such a type of regge - pole models .",
    "however some part of scientific community works in the field related to @xmath9-channel form of strong interaction dynamics and elaborates the impact picture or geometrical models @xcite , which exhibit an @xmath10 high - energy dependence and therefore it asymptotically appears a saturation of the froissart bound @xcite in these models .    in our opinion",
    "the second group of the models is more preferable than the first one from many points of view ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , careful analysis of the experimental data on hadronic total cross sections and comparative study of two above mentioned characteristic asymptotic parameterizations have shown that statistically a ",
    "froissart - like \" type parameterization for hadronic total cross sections is strongly favoured @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "if we suppose that unitarity saturation of fundamental forces takes place at super - high energies then the energy dependence of hadronic total cross sections can be derived and investigated independently of phenomenological models but using only general principles of relativistic quantum theory , such as analyticity and unitarity , together with dynamic apparatus of single - time formalism in qft @xcite .",
    "the experimental information on the behaviour of hadronic total cross sections at ultrahigh energies can be obtained from cosmic ray experiments . in this respect , analysis of extensive air showers observations provides a unique source of such information .",
    "in fact , the ultrahigh energy hadronic interactions occur when a primary cosmic ray proton collides on air nucleus and as a result the extensive air showers are produced by hadronic cascade in the atmosphere . the primary cosmic ray protons with energy of @xmath11",
    "have been observed in the utah ",
    "fly s eye \" detector",
    ". this energy significantly exceeds the energy available at now working accelerators and lhc in the near future as well . that is why , the cosmic - ray data on hadronic total cross sections are most important .",
    "recently we have two sets of data on proton - proton total cross sections extracted from cosmic ray air showers observations @xcite , including one point at @xmath12 from fly s eye collaboration experiment @xcite and six points up to @xmath13 from agasa collaboration experiment @xcite .",
    "it is well known fact that extracting proton - proton total cross sections from cosmic ray extensive air showers observations is not so straightforward .",
    "the physical description of extensive air showers created by hadronic cascade in the atmosphere depends significantly on the fundamental dynamics for hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions at ultrahigh energies .",
    "moreover , a procedure of extracting any information about basic hadronic interactions requires , as a rule , some model , which relates , for example , proton - nucleus inelastic ( absorption ) cross section to the proton - proton total cross section . having in the hands such reliable relation we could to discriminate which of the different models for the high - energy behaviour of the proton - proton total cross sections are consistent with cosmic ray data at ultrahigh energies and which may be ruled out . in this respect ,",
    "cosmic - ray experiment may serve as a discriminator or as a filter for the different phenomenological models .",
    "the procedure generally used to relate the proton - air inelastic cross section to the proton - proton total cross section is the glauber multiple - scattering approach @xcite . however , at present time we can find in the literature some debate concerning the procedure of extracting the @xmath2 total cross sections from cosmic ray experimental data .",
    "we shortly present here the basic conclusions of these polemics .",
    "it was pointed out in paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as nnn ) that glauber method establishes the relationship between proton - nucleus absorption cross section and proton - proton inelastic cross section , which we write in the form _ abs^p - air = g[_inel^pp , b_el^pp,^nucl ] , [ 1 ] where @xmath14 is nuclear matter density , @xmath15 is the slope of @xmath2 differential elastic scattering cross section b_el^pp= [ ( ) ] _",
    "t=0 , [ 2 ] @xmath16 is @xmath2 inelastic cross section _",
    "inel^pp = _ tot^pp - _ el^pp,[3 ] @xmath17 is @xmath18 absorption cross section _ abs^p - air = _ tot^p - air - _ el^p - air - _ q - el^p - air,[4 ] @xmath19 is quasi - elastic @xmath18 cross section corresponding to the intermediate excited states of air nucleus , @xmath20 is some known functional of the quantities @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the same glauber transformation between inelastic proton - nucleus cross section and proton - proton total cross section is true as well @xcite _ inel^p - air = g[_tot^pp , b_el^pp,^nucl ] , [ 5 ] where @xmath20 is the same functional as in eq . 1 , and _",
    "inel^p - air = _ tot^p - air - _ el^p - air .",
    "[ 6 ] if we additionally suppose the geometric scaling in the form @xmath21 , then glauber formula ( [ 1 ] ) can be used for extraction @xmath16 from measured values of @xmath17 . in that case",
    "the total cross section @xmath22 is obtained from that extracted inelastic @xmath2 cross section @xmath16 by adding the elastic cross section : @xmath23 .",
    "that is why , nikolaev argued that the underestimated values of @xmath22 were inferred in akeno collaboration paper @xcite .",
    "a reanalysis of the akeno data made in nnn paper gives a proton - proton total cross section about @xmath24 larger than found in @xcite , its the main conclusion presented in nnn paper @xcite .",
    "a quite opposite conclusion we found in paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as bhs ) .",
    "block et al . faced with the problem to predict proton - air and proton - proton cross sections at energies near @xmath12 using glauber approach and their qcd - ispired parameterization of all accelerator data on forward proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering amplitudes .",
    "when bhs confronted their predictions of @xmath18 cross sections @xmath25 as a function of energy with published cross section measurements of the fly s eye and agasa groups , they found that the predictions systematically are about one standard deviation below the published cosmic ray values @xcite ; see fig . 1 .    ( 120,40 ) ( 10,-28 )    to overcome these troubles block et al .",
    "emphasized that the measured quantity in cosmic ray experiment is the shower attenuation length or the mean free path for development of air showers @xmath26 which is not only sensitive to the interaction length of the protons in the atmosphere ( mean free path ) @xmath27 but also depends on the inelasticity parameter @xmath28 , which determines the rate at which the energy of the primary proton is dissipated into electromagnetic shower energy observed in the experiment @xcite = k_p - air = k. [ 7 ] the rate of shower development and its fluctuations are the origin of the deviation of @xmath28 from unity in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is model dependently estimated through monte carlo simulations , its predicted values range from 1.5 for a model where the inclusive cross section exhibits feynman scaling to 1.1 for the models with large scaling violations .",
    "akeno collaboration used @xmath29 and this value of @xmath28 was obtained with the assumption that there is no significant break of feynman scaling in the fragmentation region ( @xmath30 ) and that the multiplicity increases as @xmath10 @xcite . if we assume a breakdown of scaling in the fragmentation region , a smaller value of @xmath28 is expected .",
    "fly s eye collaboration @xcite used @xmath31 with uncertainty of 10% .",
    "the extraction of the @xmath2 cross section from the cosmic ray data is a two stage procedure .",
    "first , from measured value of @xmath26 and fixed value of @xmath28 one calculates the @xmath18 inelastic cross section inferred in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , where . ]",
    "@xmath32 this step neglects the possibility that @xmath28 may have a weak energy dependence over the range measured .    in the next step the glauber formula ( [ 1 ] ) transforms the value of @xmath25 into a proton - proton inelastic cross section @xmath16 . here",
    "all the necessary steps are calculable in the framework of glauber theory , but depend sensitively on a knowledge of the slope @xmath15 as it was mentioned above .",
    "block et al . decided to let @xmath28 be a free parameter and to make a global fit to the accelerator and cosmic ray data using the qcd - inspired parameterization of the forward proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering amplitudes .",
    "so , in they global fit , all 4 quantities , @xmath22 , @xmath15 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 were simultaneously fitted .",
    "the fit also neglected the energy dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "it was found that the accelerator and cosmic ray @xmath2 cross sections are readily reconcilable using a value of @xmath34 , where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic ones respectively .",
    "they concluded that this determination of @xmath28 severely constrains any model of high energy hadronic interactions .    at the lhc ( @xmath35 ) , they predicted @xmath36 for the @xmath2 total cross section , @xmath37 for the elastic slope and @xmath38 for the ratio @xmath39 , where the quoted errors are due to the statistical errors of the fitting parameters .",
    "recently a simple theoretical formula describing the global structure of @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross sections in the whole range of energies available at now working accelerators has been derived @xcite .",
    "the fit to the accelerators experimental data with the formula has been made and it was shown that there is a very good correspondence of the theoretical formula to the existing experimental data . in figs .",
    "2,3 , we have presented the fit results .",
    "( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    ( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    it was also demonstrated in papers @xcite ( see figs .",
    "8,7 there ) , that experimental point from cosmic ray fly s eye collaboration do not contradict to the theoretical predictions made from the fit to the accelerator data only .",
    "unfortunately , we did not have in the hands at that time the numerical experimental values from cosmic ray experiment of agasa collaboration .",
    "now these values are available in the database of particle data group @xcite and we can compare our theoretical predictions with all existing cosmic - ray data on proton - proton total cross sections . the comparison is shown in figs . 4,5 .",
    "( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    ( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    as is seen from the figures there is very good correspondence of the theory to all existing cosmic ray experimental data without any reanalysis of the data",
    ". what can we learn from this very nice , at least for us , fact and what really could it mean ?    to understand it more clearly we plotted in fig .",
    "6 an error band where upper and lower curves correspond to one deviation in the fitting parameter @xmath41 which controls the high energy asymptotic in the total cross section @xcite .",
    "( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    as one can see from this figure the error band is narrow enough so , there is no a large room for the experimental uncertainties . in this respect",
    "a more precise total cross section @xmath22 measurements at cosmic ray energies are very desirable .",
    "anyway , we would like to emphasize that we faced here a happy case when the predicted values for @xmath22 obtained from theoretical description of all existing accelerators data are completely compatible with the values obtained from cosmic ray experiments . here",
    "we confront with the conclusion made in paper @xcite .",
    "the best fit of accelerators data made in paper @xcite and they predictions up to cosmic - ray energies are close to our theory predictions within error band but a little bit lower though . at the lhc we predict _",
    "tot^pp(=14tev ) = 116.53 3.52mb,[8 ] which is in @xmath42 higher than the bhs prediction .",
    "our estimated value @xmath43 is significantly lower than the value predicted by nnn ; see fig .",
    "( 150,82 ) ( 15,-5 ) ( 92,-15)@xmath40 ( 0,45 )    let s try to explain these discrepancies .",
    "in reanalysis of cosmic ray experimental data made by nnn the formula _",
    "in^pp = [ _ abs^p - air/507mb]^1.89100 mb [ 9 ] has been used .",
    "it has been argued by nnn that this formula is valid to a few percent accuracy at @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 . using cosmic ray experimental data identified with @xmath17 nikolaev obtained @xmath46 with the help of formula ( [ 9 ] ) and after that the total cross section @xmath22 was obtained by adding the elastic cross section : @xmath47 .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that eq . [ 9 ] is not a theoretically well grounded formula but a pure phenomenological one .",
    "that is why , the further theoretical study of multiparticle dynamics is needed .    concerning the bhs analysis we might apply the arguments of nnn and say that , in fact , bhs extracted @xmath46 from cosmic ray experimental measurements of @xmath25 but not @xmath22 as it has been argued by bhs .",
    "therefore to obtain @xmath22 we have to add @xmath48 to the values extracted by bhs , and in that case we would come to the agreement with the values published by cosmic - ray experimental groups .",
    "it should be noted that bhs did not cite the paper of nnn .",
    "our theory predictions and cosmic - ray experimental data are just in the middle between nnn and bhs .",
    "we suppose that this is the golden middle .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to hope that in the near future it would be possible to repeat the cosmic ray experiments to measure ( or to extract ) the proton - proton total cross sections with a higher accuracy . a more precise total cross section @xmath22 measurements at cosmic ray energies are very desirable . surely , we have in analysing the experimental data to use a right theory , which in our opinion the local quantum field theory is . here",
    "we did not make any attempts to rescale the cosmic - ray experimental data to fit them to our theory predictions or to some phenomenological formula as it was made in bhs paper .",
    "in contrary to bhs we have shown that our theoreticaly derived formula , which describes the global structure of all accelerator data for proton - proton total cross sections from the most low energies to the most high ones , is completely compatible with the existing cosmic - ray experimental data as well .",
    "this is our basic conclusion .",
