    "the first generation of stars are believed to have had a significant impact on the cosmic evolution through their radiative , mechanical and chemical feedback  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stellar extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) photons  ( @xmath5 ev ) ionize the circumstellar gas to form an hii region , thereby initiating the process of the reionization of the intergalactic medium  ( igm ) . even the single supernova ( sn ) of a massive ( @xmath6 ) first - star is able to totally evacuate the gas and suppresses subsequent star formation in the same minihalo  @xcite although some of the materials blown out by the sn of a less - massive ( @xmath7 ) progenitor may fall back again and commence another episode of star formation  @xcite .",
    "the ejected gas by a sn contributes to the metal enrichment of the igm .",
    "the extent of such feedback depends crucially on the initial mass function ( imf ) , as well as the star formation rate ( sfr ) , of first stars .",
    "stars formed from the metal - free primordial gas , or population iii ( pop iii ) stars , have been classified into two sub - populations depending on whether the gas is still in an undisturbed pristine state with a low electron fraction @xmath8  ( pop iii.1 ) , or the gas has already been affected by the radiative or kinematic feedback from pre - existing stars  ( pop iii.2 ) , following the nomenclature proposed by oshea et al .",
    "despite with the same primordial composition , the thermal evolution of the gas is fairly different in those cases , resulting in different characteristic stellar masses . in the standard @xmath9cdm cosmology ,",
    "pop iii.1 stars are predicted to be formed in minihalos of @xmath10  @xcite . during its protostellar collapse ,",
    "cooling is entirely by @xmath11 , which is produced by the following electron - catalyzed reaction  ( so - called the @xmath12 channel ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath13 @xmath14 with the high value of the minimum temperature @xmath15 attained at the density @xmath16 , the fragmentation mass is as large as @xmath17  @xcite , which is set by the jeans mass at this epoch . in this case ,",
    "the final mass of formed stars is set by the radiative feedback from the growing protostar , and its value is a few 10 - a few 100 @xmath18 , much higher than the present - day counterpart  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , pop iii.2 stars are formed from the metal - free gas affected either by the radiative or kinematic feedback from earlier generation of stars , typically in atomic - cooling halos with virial temperatures @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "an example of pop iii.2 stars is those formed in the relic hii regions of defunct pop iii stars  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "a larger amount of @xmath11 is produced  ( @xmath20 ) via the @xmath12 channel  ( eqs .",

    "the characteristic mass of stars formed in such an environment is predicted to be @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "that is , pop iii.2 stars may be typically less massive than preceding pop iii.1 stars although they are more massive than ordinary present - day stars .    with high effective temperatures ( @xmath25 )  @xcite ,",
    "massive pop iii stars emit a copious amount of far - uv ( fuv ) photons in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands ( @xmath26 ev ) .",
    "the fuv radiation field photodissociates @xmath11 , thereby prohibiting efficient cooling in the primordial gas .",
    "even a single massive pop iii star emits enough fuv photons to suppress the subsequent star formation in the same halo  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gas in a minihalo is fairly vulnerable to the external irradiation of fuv photons and thus the number of pop iii.1 stars formed can be severely regulated by the fuv background  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , pop iii.2 star formation in more massive halos still goes on by atomic cooling even under the fuv background and is not strongly affected .",
    "( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates the possibility that pop iii.2 stars can be the major population of primordial stars and significant sources of radiative and chemical feedback to subsequent star formation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pop iii.2 star - formation epoch may have lasted until redshifts as low as @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "if so , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) or sne of pop iii.2 stars are detectable with future facilities , which allow us to peer into the nature of primordial stars  @xcite .",
    "later , however , it was found that hd formation is strongly suppressed in the presence of even a weak fuv radiation field  ( yoshida et al .",
    "2007b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the slight photodissociation of @xmath11 causes the significant reduction of the hd fraction . without hd cooling , the thermal evolution of a pop iii.2 star - forming gas becomes identical to the pop iii.1 case , resulting in pop iii.2 stars having similar masses to pop iii.1 stars .",
    "however , this is not yet the conclusive result since the previous studies have not properly taken account of the following effects , which favors hd formation / cooling .    in the galaxy formation epoch , shocks occur ubiquitously , for example , associating with the virialization of halos or sn explosions . in a shocked gas ,",
    "the enhanced ionization degree enables efficient h@xmath28/hd formation and cooling  @xcite . for a strong shock ,",
    "the post - shock gas is compressed isobarically with its cooling , i.e. , the temperature decreases with increasing the density  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , for the free - falling cloud in a relic hii region , rapid cooling makes the temperature to plummet almost isochorically , i.e. , the temperature decreases at a constant density  ( yoshida et al .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the higher column density ,",
    "the fuv radiation field is more effectively shielded for the post - shock flow than in the relic hii region , resulting in the lower fuv flux in the former case . nonetheless , in the previous studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the post - shock flows are treated without the proper account of the isobaric nature of evolution .",
    "associated with star - formation activities , not only the fuv background , but also the cosmic ray  ( cr ) background is expected to be generated by way of the cr acceleration in sn remnants .",
    "cr irradiation promotes @xmath11 and hd formation / cooling by enhancing the ionization degree  @xcite .",
    "thus , cr irradiation is able to counteract with the negative feedback of fuv radiation .",
    "however , only either fuv or cr irradiation has been considered in the previous studies  @xcite and their combined effects have not been fully understood .    in this paper , we study the conditions for hd cooling to become important in pop iii.2 star formation under the presence of both fuv and cr backgrounds .",
    "we calculate the temperature and chemical evolution of ( i ) a cloud compressed by plane - parallel steady shocks  @xcite , and of ( ii ) a free - falling cloud in a relic hii region .",
    "we find that the critical value for fuv intensity above which hd cooling is quenched is about an order of magnitude higher in the former than in the latter case .",
    "also the critical fuv intensity increases with increasing cr intensity .",
    "we also estimate the background fuv and cr intensities from theoretically predicted values for the sfr in the high - redshift universe . by comparing the background fuv intensity with the critical value ,",
    "we conclude that the hd mode of pop iii.2 star formation is fairly common at the galaxy formation epoch .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] , we describe the numerical model and initial conditions for our calculation . in  [ sec : result ] , we present the results for the free - falling clouds in relic hii regions and for the clouds compressed either by the virialization shock or by the sn blast wave .",
    "we also present the critical fuv intensity for hd cooling as a function of the cr intensity . in  [ sec : estimate ] , we estimate the background fuv and cr intensities in high - redshift universe , and discuss whether the hd cooling condition is satisfied at these epochs .",
    "after discussing the implications and uncertainties of our study in  [ sec : discussion ] , we summarize our findings in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we present our model for calculating the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial clouds .      here , we first describe the method of calculation for the free - falling cloud in a relic hii region and then for the shock - compressed gas in structure formation or an sn explosion .",
    "we use the one - zone model , where we focus on the evolution of the central core for the free - falling cloud and of the coolest gas layer for the shock - compressed gas before the self - gravity becomes effective by using the plane - parallel and steady shock approximation .      when a pop iii star dies and collapses directly to a black hole ( bh ) , the gas in the relic hii region surrounding the star begins to recombine and cool to form a subsequent star  @xcite . here",
    ", we assume that the formed bh has no influence on the evolution of the gas in the relic hii region for simplicity . at first",
    ", the baryon mass in the relic hii region is too small for the gas to contract by self - gravity , but the gas loses pressure - support by efficient radiative cooling and contracts being attracted by the gravitational potential of the dm halo .",
    "after the temperature decreases so that the jeans mass becomes lower than the hii region mass , the gas begins to contract in the almost free - fall way by self - gravity .",
    "owing to its high pressure , the gas in the hii region is accelerated monotonically with radius up to a supersonic velocity and expands into the interstellar medium  ( whalen et al .",
    "2004 ; kitayama et al .",
    ". however , our model does not take into account the initial velocity profile within the hii region for simplicity .",
    "the following prescription is the same as the previous studies  ( johnson & bromm 2006 ; yoshida , omukai & hernquist 2007 ; wolcott - green & haiman 2011 ) .",
    "an isolated cloud collapsing at the rate close to free - fall by its self - gravity develops a core - envelope structure  @xcite , consisting of a nearly jeans - scale core with the constant density and an envelope where the density decreases radially as @xmath29 . in our one - zone model",
    ", we follow the evolution of the physical quantities at the core center  @xcite .",
    "since collapse proceeds roughly at the free - fall rate , the density evolves as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free - fall time and @xmath32 the gravitational constant .",
    "temperature evolution follows the energy equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath35 the pressure , @xmath36 the net cooling rate per unit volume . to supplement the equations above",
    ", the ideal - gas equation of state @xmath37 is used , where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 the proton mass and @xmath40 the mean molecular weight . using the ratio of specific heat @xmath41 , specific",
    "energy is related to pressure as @xmath42 . throughout this paper",
    ", we take @xmath43 and @xmath44 neglecting molecular contribution .",
    "considering that the size of the contracting core is half the jeans length @xmath45 , we calculate the column density of the core as @xmath46  @xcite . in this case , the initial size of this region is estimated as @xmath47 kpc , which is an overestimation compared to the typical size of an hii region @xmath48 pc  ( whalen et al .",
    "2004 ; kitayama et al .",
    ". however , at the beginning of collapse , owing to the low gas density and h@xmath28 fraction , the h@xmath28 column density will be too low for effectively shielding the gas from the fuv filed , and the above overestimation will not matter for estimating the shielding factor .    in our model of free - fall collapse , the collapse equation and the energy equation ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : drho_dt ] , [ eq : energy ] ) are decoupled and feedback from thermal pressure is not included for simplicity . in the runaway - collapse phase , an isothermal cloud collapses approximately at a free - fall rate  @xcite .",
    "although the pressure gradient is not negligible , the deviation of the collapse time from free fall is only by a factor of 1.58  @xcite . for a non - isothermal case ,",
    "the deviation is represented as a monotonically increasing function of the effective adiabatic index @xmath41 of the cloud in equations 7 - 9 of @xcite . for example , the collapse time becomes @xmath49 times longer than the free - fall time for @xmath50 .",
    "if we use this generalized collapse time for the collapse equation , the collapse equation 4 is coupled with the energy equation 5 . however , we find that the effective adiabatic index becomes smaller than 1.2 for most of the evolutionary trajectory , and the deviation from free - fall may be at most by a factor of a few .",
    "thus , feedback from thermal pressure may change our results little .    here , we consider that an overdense region collapsing within an hii region is large enough . then , since the overdense region is strongly bounded by the gravitational field of dm and gas , it contracts by the gravitational force which exceeds the pressure force from its less - dense surroundings .",
    "therefore , the compression of the overdense region by external pressure may be neglected , and it will collapse roughly at a free - fall rate .    although our formulation does not include dm gravity , it becomes significant at the beginning of gas evolution .",
    "then , we recalculate the evolution of the gas in relic hii regions taking account of dm gravity by modifying @xmath51 in @xmath52 of eq . to @xmath53 , but we find little change in our results . here , @xmath54 is the mean dm mass density of a virialized halo at @xmath55 .      after the passage of a blast wave , which is generated in structure formation or an sn explosion , the post - shock gas has a very high temperature due to shock heating and it cools and contracts with the radiative cooling time . at first , self - gravity is not effective in the shocked gas layer .",
    "we focus on the evolution of the most cooled gas layer , assuming that the post - shock gas layer is plane - parallel and the flow is steady  @xcite .",
    "the initial condition of a shock - compressed gas is characterized by two parameters : the pre - shock density @xmath56 and the velocity of the shock front @xmath57 . in the strong shock limit ,",
    "the physical quantities just behind the shock front are given by the rankine - hugoniot relation : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where the subscripts 0 and 1 refer to the pre- and post - shock quantities , respectively .",
    "behind the shock front , the flow evolution is described by @xmath62 @xmath63 along with the energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "the column density of the post - shock gas can be estimated from @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number density in the pre - shock gas and @xmath66 is the time since the shock occurs .",
    "rapid cooling in the post - shock layer leads to the formation of a dense gas shell , which eventually becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments . for the sn shock , we assume that fragmentation occurs when the column density of the post - shock layer @xmath67 exceeds that in the jeans length @xmath68 @xcite : @xmath69 for the structure - formation shock , the mass of the post - shock layer is doubled compared to the sn case , since in one dimension , two flows",
    "collide to form the shocked region and two shock fronts propagate in opposite directions to each other . in this case",
    ", fragmentation occurs under the condition : @xmath70 in addition to them , for fragmentation , the growth time of a perturbation , which is approximately given by the local free - fall time @xmath52 , must be shorter than the contraction time of the layer , i.e. , the cooling time @xmath71 ( yamada & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "we have confirmed this condition is always satisfied at the fragmentation epoch determined by the column - density conditions given above . after fragmentation , each fragment or clump begins to contract by its self - gravity .",

    "we take account of the doppler shift due to the bulk motion of the cloud as in @xcite for the free - falling case and in @xcite for the shock - compressed case .",
    "the stellar radiation field is assumed to have the diluted black - body spectrum with the temperature of @xmath90  k , resembling that from a pop ii star cluster , and its intensity is parameterized by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the intensity at the lyman limit .",

    "future studies should take all these feedback into consideration .",

    "they did not consider the gas in the primordial composition as well .",
    "thus , the above effects on our results should be investigated through the 3d mhd simulations in the future .",
    "another example is that our assumption of the time - independent shock velocity becomes invalid at least in the sn - shock , according to the one - dimensional numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the sn - shock velocity becomes lower than @xmath175 at @xmath272 yr after the explosion .",

    "thus , whether this realistic evolution of the sn shock front significantly changes our results is not clear , and more detailed numerical calculations are needed for more concrete discussion .",
    "hd molecules form abundantly in the primordial gas with enhanced initial ionization and play a dominant role in gas cooling . at the epoch of galaxy formation  ( @xmath205 ) , shocks occur ubiquitously associated with the mass assembly as well as the sn explosions . in such a shock - compressed gas ,",

    "other examples include the cloud in the relic hii region of a defunct pop iii star and that with modest cr irradiation . however , even a low level of the fuv background suppresses hd formation / cooling via @xmath11 photodissociation in cases without cr irradiation . in this paper , we have examined the conditions for efficient hd cooling in primordial star formation by calculating the thermal and chemical evolution of a gas cloud under both fuv and cr irradiation .",
    "we have obtained the critical fuv intensity @xmath160 for hd cooling as a function of the cr intensity @xmath80 , and compared it with the estimated background level @xmath239 .",
    "we have considered both cases of the free - falling cloud in a relic hii region and a shock - compressed gas .    at @xmath277",
    ", the background cr intensity is estimated as @xmath278 of the galactic value . in this case",
    ", the critical fuv intensity @xmath160 in relic hii regions is below the background level @xmath239 and hd cooling is suppressed there .",
    "however , as the background cr intensity increases with the cosmic star formation , the critical intensity @xmath160 is also elevated and eventually exceeds the background level @xmath239 at @xmath4 . below this redshift , hd cooling becomes efficient and hd - pop iii star formation proceeds if some primordial environments still survive .    on the other hand ,",
    "the critical fuv intensity @xmath160 for the shock - compressed gas is @xmath2 times higher than that for the relic hii region even in the weak cr regime as @xmath278 of the galactic value .",
    "this is because the shock - compressed gas evolves isobarically  ( i.e. , gas cools with its density increasing ) , while the gas in a relic hii region evolves isochorically  ( i.e. , the gas cools at a constant density ) due to the initial rapid cooling .",
    "moreover , shocks tend to occur in denser environments  ( e.g. , cold - accretion flows ) than relic hii regions . as a result",
    ", the shock - compressed gas is shielded from the fuv field more effectively , and has higher critical intensity .",
    "thus , for the shock - compressed gas , the critical value @xmath160 exceeds the background level @xmath239 and hd - pop iii star formation proceeds for most of the redshift we consider ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "our result suggests that hd - pop iii stars can be more common than previously considered and could be even the dominant population of pop iii stars .",
    "iii stars are born in clumps as massive as @xmath279 , but the final stellar mass is set to @xmath1 by the stellar radiative feedback onto the accretion flow  @xcite . on the other hand , hd - pop iii stars form in clumps of @xmath1 , and the final mass is typically set to a few @xmath280 by the stellar feedback @xcite .",
    "these previous results may suggest that the star formation efficiency , i.e. , the mass ratio of formed stars to the parent clouds , of hd - pop iii stars is several times higher than that of h2-pop iii stars .",
    "they also imply the possibility that hd - pop iii stars could be the majority of pop iii.2 stars . then , hd - pop iii stars of a few 10 @xmath281 can be important sources of radiative feedback at the epoch of galaxy formation . moreover , according to the observations of the abundance pattens in the metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy , the imprints of a pair - instability sn have not been discovered yet  @xcite . since stars with @xmath282",
    "end their lives as core - collapse sne  @xcite , hd - pop iii stars might be the major contributor to the metal enrichment in the ism / igm at that epoch , if there were no pisne in the universe .",
    "recent discoveries of the almost pristine gas with metallicity @xmath283 in the damped ly @xmath76 systems at @xmath284 and @xmath285  @xcite imply that metal enrichment in the igm has proceeded quite inhomogeneously .",
    "theoretical models also show the inhomogeneous nature of metal enrichment in the igm .",
    "they predict that pop iii star formation can continue up to @xmath27 or even lower , and evaluate the ratio of the pop iii sfr to the total sfr as @xmath286 ( @xmath8 ) at @xmath287 ( @xmath288 )  ( tornatore et al .",
    "2007 ; johnson et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this indicates that pop iii stars can form to some extent even at @xmath241 , and our study show that they are typically formed as hd - pop iii stars with a few @xmath280 .",
    "grbs and sne from these pop iii progenitors at @xmath4 will be detected with the current or future facilities and may provide us with information on the mass , imf and sfr of these stars  ( nakauchi et al . 2012",
    "; whalen et al . 2013 ; tanaka et al . 2013 ) . moreover , if the hd absorption lines are detected in the spectrum of a grb afterglow which lacks metal absorption , hd is confirmed as the dominant coolant in that primordial gas  @xcite .",
