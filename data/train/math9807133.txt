    "finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given matrix is one of the basic techniques in linear algebra , with countless applications .",
    "the familiar case of hermitian ( complex ) matrices is very important , for instance in quantum mechanics , where the fact that such matrices have real eigenvalues allows them to represent physically observable quantities .    the eigenvalue problem is usually formulated over the complex numbers @xmath1 , including the reals @xmath2 as a special case . in recent work @xcite , we considered the generalization to the other normed division algebras , namely the quaternions @xmath3 and the octonions @xmath4 .",
    "most of the basic properties are retained , provided they are reinterpreted to take into account the lack of commutativity of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the lack of associativity of @xmath4 . however , there are a number of surprises , including the fact that such matrices admit non - real eigenvalues .",
    "our most important results concern the eigenvalue problem for @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices , the _ jordan matrices_. it turns out @xcite that such matrices admit more than the expected 3 real eigenvalues , and that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues fail in general to be orthogonal in the usual sense , although they do seem to be orthogonal in a generalized sense .    because of the lack of both commutativity and associativity , working with octonionic matrices is rather tricky .",
    "all of the above results were initially discovered using a _",
    "mathematica _",
    "package we have developed over the years for just this purpose . while we have subsequently been able to derive more elegant derivations by hand for some of these results , we have not succeeded in doing this for all . in particular , the only current proof of the generalized orthogonality property consists of a lengthy , brute force _ mathematica _  computation , which used 6 hours of cpu time on a sparc20 with 224 mb of memory .",
    "this article describes both the mathematics behind this result , and the _ mathematica_computation used to obtain it .",
    "we set the stage in section  [ background ] by reviewing some basic properties about both the standard eigenvalue problem and the octonions , as well as introducing our _ mathematica _  package .",
    "we then summarize the theory of @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices in section  [ jordanmatrices ] , pointing out that the only known proof of some of the results in this section involves direct computation using _",
    "mathematica_. in section  [ example ] we give an explicit example , and we discuss our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we begin by collecting some standard results about the standard eigenvalue problem .",
    "we give the details of some of the proofs in order to emphasize the use of both the commutativity and associativity of @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem as usually stated is to find solutions @xmath5 to the equation @xmath6 for a given square matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the basic properties of the eigenvalue problem for @xmath8  complex hermitian matrices are well - understood .",
    "an @xmath8  complex hermitian matrix @xmath7 has @xmath9 eigenvalues ( counting multiplicity ) , all of which are real .",
    "we give here only the proof that the eigenvalues are real .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 satisfy ( [ orig ] ) , with @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 so that if @xmath14 we have @xmath15 , which forces @xmath16 .",
    "eigenvectors of an @xmath8  complex hermitian matrix @xmath7 corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal .    for @xmath17 ,",
    "let @xmath18 be an eigenvector of @xmath19 with eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "by the previous lemma , @xmath21 . then",
    "@xmath22 then either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .    for any @xmath8  complex hermitian matrix @xmath7",
    ", there exists an orthonormal basis of @xmath25 consisting of eigenvectors of @xmath7 .",
    "if all eigenvalues have multiplicity one , the result follows from the previous lemma .",
    "but the gram - schmidt orthogonalization process can be used on any eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue with multiplicity greater than one .",
    "these lemmas are equivalent to the standard result that a complex hermitian matrix can always be diagonalized by a unitary transformation .",
    "it is important for what follows to realize that the form of the proofs given above relies on both the commutativity and the associativity of @xmath1 .    combining the above results , it is easy to see that any ( complex ) hermitian matrix @xmath7 admits a decomposition in terms of an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors",
    ".    let @xmath7 be an @xmath8  complex hermitian matrix .",
    "then @xmath7 can be expanded as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath20 .    by the previous lemma",
    ", there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath28 of eigenvectors .",
    "it then suffices to check that @xmath29 but this follows by direct computation using orthonormality .",
    "furthermore , the set of eigenvalues @xmath30 is unique , and the ( unit ) eigenvectors are unique up to unitary transformations in the separate eigenspaces ( which reduce to multiplication by a complex phase for eigenvalues of multiplicity one ) .      the quaternions @xmath3 double the dimension of the complex numbers by adding two additional square roots of @xmath31 , usually denoted @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the multiplication table follows from @xmath34 and associativity ; note that @xmath3 is not commutative .",
    "equivalently , @xmath3 can be viewed as the sum of 2 copies of the complex numbers @xmath35 with @xmath32 being defined by @xmath36 .",
    "the octonions @xmath4 in turn can be viewed as the direct sum of two copies of the quaternions @xmath37 where @xmath38 is yet another square root of @xmath31 .",
    "the octonions are thus spanned by the identity element @xmath39 and the 7 imaginary units @xmath40 .",
    "these units can be grouped into ( the imaginary parts of ) quaternionic subspaces in 7 different ways ; these will be referred to as `` triples '' .",
    "any three of these imaginary units which do not lie in a such a triple anti - associate .",
    "the multiplication table can be neatly summarized by appropriately labeling the 7-point projective plane , as shown in figure  [ omult ] .",
    "= 3.5 in    even though the octonions are not associative , since any 2 octonions lie in a quaternionic subspace , products involving only 2 different octonions ( and their octonionic conjugates ) do associate .",
    "for example , @xmath41 which is a weak form of associativity known as",
    "_ alternativity_.",
    "we use the notation @xmath42 to denote the ( octonionic ) conjugate of the octonion @xmath43 , @xmath44 to denote the squared norm of @xmath43 , @xmath45 to denote the ( octonionic ) hermitian conjugate of the matrix @xmath7 , @xmath46 : = ab - ba\\ ] ] to denote the commutator of @xmath43 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 : = ( ab)c - a(bc)\\ ] ] to denote the associator of @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 .",
    "both the commutator and the associator are purely imaginary , totally antisymmetric , and change sign if any one of their arguments is replaced by its conjugate .",
    "another octonionic product with these properties is given by the _ associative 3-form _",
    "@xcite @xmath50 which reduces to the vector triple product when @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 are imaginary quaternions .",
    "@xmath51 c ) \\label{phieq}\\ ] ]      we needed a way to easily manipulate octonions and octonionic matrices  it is quite difficult to unlearn associativity",
    "! there are 2 complementary approaches , depending on whether it is desired to manipulate abstract octonions or whether an explicit basis can be used . for our purposes , it was initially quite sufficient to work with an abstract basis : we define an octonion to be a list with 8 elements @xmath52 where the signs are conventional , and where we have emphasized the role of the imaginary units as `` basis vectors '' by writing them in boldface .",
    "octonionic multiplication can then be expressed as a series of rules of the form @xmath53 where we have introduced the symbol @xmath54 to represent octonionic multiplication .",
    "octonionic conjugation can be defined as a series of rules of the form @xmath55 and everything else can be defined in terms of these 2 basic operations .",
    "= 2.5 in    1    furthermore , as already stated , computations involving small numbers of octonions can be dramatically simplified .",
    "for instance , 3 arbitrary octonions can be assumed to take the form @xmath56    when implementing these ideas using _ mathematica _ , it turned out to be more efficient to define the 2 fundamental operations directly on lists , rather than building them up in terms of rules .",
    "for instance , conjugation is more easily defined by @xmath57:= \\nonumber\\\\      \\qquad\\qquad\\tt\\{x1,-x2,-x3,-x4,-x5,-x6,-x7,-x8\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and there is an analogous definition of octonionic multiplication , called omult .",
    "a illustration of computation in an explicit basis appears in figure  [ basicsii ] .",
    "matrices can now be constructed as nested lists , and operations such as matrix multiplication can easily be defined .",
    "however , matrix expressions involving several octonions quickly become unwieldy . we therefore supplemented the above basic definitions in terms of an explicit basis with an alternative set of definitions using abstract octonions . in the process",
    ", we took full advantage of the formatting capabilities in _ mathematica _  3.0 .",
    "an illustration of computation using the abstract approach appears in figure  [ basicsi ] .    1    even though we chose not to implement the concrete version of the basic octonionic operations in terms of rules , _ mathematica _ s ability to manipulate such rules was crucial in constructing the abstract version .",
    "especially when teaching _ mathematica _  to both manipulate and print matrices of lists ( i.e.octonions ) , the ability to easily modify the code to recognize special cases proved extremely helpful .",
    "( octonions are closely related to _ clifford algebras _ ; see for instance @xcite , in which the representation theory of clifford algebras is extended so as to employ octonions .",
    "there are a number of packages for manipulating clifford algebras , some of which are described in @xcite .",
    "several of these can handle octonions , such as the program clical by pertti lounesto @xcite and the maple package clifford by rafa  abamowicz @xcite , both of which introduce the octonions as paravectors over an appropriate clifford algebra @xcite .",
    "there is also an older maple package octonion ( and the companion package clifford ) by jrg schray @xcite . )",
    "it is not immediately obvious that @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices have a well - defined determinant , let alone a characteristic equation .",
    "we therefore first discuss some of the properties of these matrices before turning to the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices , henceforth referred to as the _",
    "jordan matrices _ , form the _ exceptional jordan algebra _ under the _ jordan product _ @xmath58 which is commutative , but not associative .",
    "a special case of this is @xmath59 and we _ define _",
    "remarkably , with these definitions , jordan matrices satisfy the usual characteristic equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 and where the determinant @xmath64 of @xmath7 is defined abstractly in terms of the freudenthal product @xcite @xmath65 which leads to @xmath66 concretely , if @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then @xmath70 the determinant calculation is illustrated in figure  [ mathmatrices ] .    1 = 5.55 in = 5.4 in    1      each division algebra can be rewritten as a real matrix algebra of appropriate dimension ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . under this identification ,",
    "a hermitian matrix over any of the division algebras becomes a real symmetric matrix .",
    "it is therefore clear that a @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrix must have @xmath71 real eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "however , as we now discuss , instead of having ( a maximum of ) 3 distinct real eigenvalues , each with multiplicity 8 , there appear to be ( a maximum of ) 6 distinct real eigenvalues , each with multiplicity 4 .",
    "the reason for this is that , somewhat surprisingly , a ( real ) eigenvalue @xmath11 of a jordan matrix @xmath7 does _ not _ in general satisfy the characteristic equation . to see this , consider the eigenvalue equation ( [ orig ] ) , with @xmath7 as in ( [ three ] ) , @xmath72 , and where @xmath73 . assuming without loss of generality that @xmath74 , explicit computation yields @xcite @xmath75 z     & \\equiv & \\left [           \\lambda^3 - ( { { \\rm tr\\,}}a ) \\ , \\lambda^2 + \\sigma(a ) \\ , \\lambda - \\det a       \\right ] z \\nonumber\\\\    & = & b \\big ( a ( cz ) \\big ) + { \\overline}{c } \\left ( { \\overline}{a } ( { \\overline}{b}z ) \\right )       - \\left [ b(ac ) + ( { \\overline}{c}\\,{\\overline}{a}){\\overline}{b } \\right ] z \\label{charlam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath76 associate , the rhs of ( [ charlam ] ) vanishes , and @xmath11 does indeed satisfy the characteristic equation ( [ char ] ) ; this will not happen in general",
    ". however , since the lhs of ( [ charlam ] ) is a real multiple of @xmath76 , this must also be true of the rhs , so that @xmath77 z    = rz \\qquad\\qquad r\\in{{\\mathbb r}}\\label{rreal}\\ ] ] which can be solved to yield a quadratic equation for @xmath78 as well as constraints on @xmath76 .",
    "the real eigenvalues of the @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrix @xmath7 satisfy the modified characteristic equation @xmath79 where @xmath78 is either of the two roots of @xmath80 \\big|^2 = 0 \\label{req}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 as defined by ( [ three ] ) and where @xmath82 was defined in ( [ phieq ] ) .",

    "an outline of the computation appears in figure  [ mathreq ] .    1 = 5.45 in    1    1    the real parameters @xmath88,@xmath89,@xmath90,@xmath91 may be freely specified for one ( nonzero ) component , say @xmath76 ; the remaining components @xmath84,@xmath85 have a similar form .    the solutions of ( [ rreal ] ) are real , since the corresponding @xmath92 real symmetric matrix has 24 real eigenvalues .",
    "we will refer to the 3 real solutions of ( [ rreal ] ) corresponding to a single value of @xmath78 as a _ family _ of eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
    "there are thus 2 families of real eigenvalues , each corresponding to a 4 independent ( over @xmath2 ) eigenvectors .",
    "we note several intriguing properties of these results .",
    "if @xmath7 is in fact complex , then the only solution of ( [ req ] ) is @xmath93 , and we recover the usual characteristic equation with a unique set of 3 ( real ) eigenvalues . if @xmath7 is quaternionic , then one solution of ( [ req ] ) is @xmath93 , leading to the standard set of 3 real eigenvalues and their corresponding quaternionic eigenvectors . however ,",
    "unless @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 involve only two independent imaginary quaternionic directions ( in which case @xmath94 $ ] ) , there will also be a nonzero solution for @xmath78 , leading to a second set of 3 real eigenvalues . finally ,",
    "if @xmath7 is octonionic ( so that in particular @xmath83\\ne0 $ ] ) , then there are two distinct solutions for @xmath78 , and hence two different sets of real eigenvalues , with corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "note that if @xmath95 $ ] then all of the eigenvalues of @xmath7 will be nonzero !",
    "the final surprise lies with the orthogonality condition for eigenvectors @xmath96 corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "it is _ not _ true that @xmath97 , although the real part of this expression does vanish @xcite .",
    "but , at least in the @xmath98 case @xcite , it is straightforward to show that what is needed to ensure a decomposition of the form ( [ decomp ] ) is the following generalized notion of orthogonality , which does in fact hold .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath99 be two octonionic vectors .",
    "we will say that @xmath99 is _ orthogonal _ to @xmath10 if @xmath100    in the @xmath0 case , a lengthy , direct computation verifies that eigenvectors with different real eigenvalues satisfy ( [ ortho ] ) _ provided that _ the same value of @xmath78 is used for both eigenvectors .    if @xmath10 and @xmath99 are eigenvectors of the @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrix @xmath7 corresponding to different real eigenvalues in the same family ( same @xmath78 value ) , then @xmath10 and @xmath99 are mutually orthogonal in the sense of ( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "[ orthothm ]    the modified characteristic equation ( [ lameq ] ) can be used to eliminate cubic and higher powers of @xmath11 from any expression .",
    "furthermore , given two distinct eigenvalues @xmath101 , subtracting the two versions of ( [ lameq ] ) and factoring the result leads to the equation @xmath102 which can be used to eliminate quadratic terms in one of the eigenvalues .",
    "we used _ mathematica _  to implement these simplifications in a brute force verification of ( [ ortho ] ) in this context , which used 6 hours of cpu time on a sun sparc20 with 224 mb of ram .",
    "a summary of the computation appears in figures [ mathorthoi ] and [ mathorthoii ] .    for jordan matrices ,",
    "we thus obtain _ two _ decompositions of the form ( [ decomp ] ) , corresponding to the two sets of real eigenvalues . for each",
    ", the eigenvectors are fixed up to orthogonal transformations which preserve the form ( [ zeq ] ) of @xmath76 .    1    1    1",
    "let @xmath7 be a @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrix .",
    "then @xmath7 can be expanded as in ( [ decomp ] ) , where @xmath103 is an orthonormal basis , as per ( [ ortho ] ) , of eigenvectors of @xmath7 corresponding to the real eigenvalues @xmath20 , which belong to the same family ( same @xmath78 value ) . [ decompthm ]    fix a family of real eigenvalues of @xmath7 by fixing @xmath78 .",
    "if the eigenvalues are distinct , then the previous theorem guarantees the existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors , and the result follows .",
    "if the eigenvalues are the same , the family consists of a single real eigenvalue @xmath11 with multiplicity 3 .",
    "then @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "writing out these two equations in terms of the components ( [ three ] ) of @xmath7 , and inserting the first into the second , results in a quadratic equation for @xmath11 ; the discriminant @xmath106 of this equation satisfies @xmath107 . but @xmath11 is assumed to be real , which forces @xmath108 , which in turn forces @xmath7 to be a multiple of the identity matrix , for which the result holds .",
    "the remaining case is when one eigenvalue , say @xmath109 , has multiplicity 2 and one has multiplicity 1 .",
    "letting @xmath10 be a ( normalized ) eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath109 , consider the matrix @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "for most values of @xmath88 , @xmath112 will have 3 distinct real eigenvalues , whose eigenvectors will be orthogonal by the previous theorem . but",
    "this means that eigenvectors of @xmath112 are also eigenvectors of @xmath7 ; the required decomposition of @xmath7 is obtained from that of @xmath112 simply by solving ( [ two ] ) for @xmath7 .",
    "note in particular that for some quaternionic matrices with determinant equal to zero , one and only one of these two decompositions will contain the eigenvalue zero .",
    "let @xmath113 be given by @xmath114 and consider the matrix @xmath115 noting that @xmath116 is quaternionic if @xmath117 .",
    "turning first to the equation for @xmath78 , ( [ rreal ] ) becomes @xmath118 with solutions @xmath119 since @xmath120 the eigenvalue equation ( [ lameq ] ) becomes @xmath121    = 4.75 in    1    an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues is @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 are arbitrary linear combinations of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , i.e.@xmath129 and where @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 note that in the limiting case @xmath132 , each @xmath133 is quaternionic , and @xmath134 reduces to @xmath39 while @xmath135 becomes @xmath136 .",
    "as expected , _ provided _ one fixes a family of eigenvectors and eigenvalues arising from a given choice of @xmath78 , these eigenvectors satisfy the orthogonality property ( [ ortho ] ) and thus lead to a decomposition of the form ( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "a partial verification of this using _ mathematica _  is given in figure  [ mathex ] .",
    "there are 2 quite different surprising aspects of our work : the mathematical changes needed to extend the eigenvalue problem to the octonions , and the fact that we have only been able to prove one of our key results using computer algebra .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .",
    "it is of course intriguing that the eigenvalue problem over the octonions changes so much , for instance in that there are unexpectedly many real eigenvalues .",
    "but we find it remarkable that so much of the standard structure remains , provided it is reinterpreted appropriately .",
    "the most striking example of this is the need to generalize what is meant by orthogonality .",
    "we can relate our notion of orthonormality to the usual one by noting that a basis of @xmath137 which is orthonormal in the sense ( [ ortho ] ) satisfies @xmath138 which follows directly from the definition .",
    "if we define a matrix @xmath139 whose columns are just @xmath140 , then this statement is equivalent to @xmath141 over the quaternions , left matrix inverses are the same as right matrix inverses , and we would also have @xmath142 or equivalently @xmath143 which is just the standard notion of orthogonality .",
    "these two notions of orthogonality fail to be equivalent over the octonions ; we have been led to view the former as more fundamental .    turning to our proof - by - computer",
    ", we reiterate that the only proof we currently have of our main orthogonality result , namely theorem  [ orthothm ] , uses _ mathematica _  to explicitly perform a horrendous , but exact , algebraic computation .",
    "while one could hope for a more elegant mathematical proof of this result , the _ mathematica _  computation nevertheless establishes a result which would otherwise remain for the moment merely a conjecture .",
    "this is a good example of being able to use the computer to verify one s intuition when it may not be possible to do so otherwise .",
    "but even more is true : throughout our work with the octonions , the ability to manipulate octonionic expressions quickly and accurately has been crucial in _ developing _ our intuition in the first place .",
    "we do not feel that we would have been able to reach anything like our current understanding of the applications of the octonions to physics , on which we continue to be working actively , without the availability of a package such as the one described here .",
    "finally , this computation was initially done in 1996 using _ mathematica _  2.2 . while preparing this paper , we attempted to reproduce the computation using _",
    "mathematica_3.0  and could nt ! even for _ mathematica _  2.2 , it was necessary to massage the computation by hand in order to succeed .",
    "one way this was done ( between figure  [ mathorthoi ] and figure  [ mathorthoii ] ) was by saving some intermediate steps to files and then restarting the kernel .",
    "another technique was not to simplify all the components of an expression at the same time .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ mathorthoii ] , the vector @xmath144 contains 3 octonions , each of which requires roughly 8 mb .",
    "comparing the computations both versions of _ mathematica _  could handle , _ mathematica _  3.0 appears to require nearly 4 times as much cpu time for the same computation ; this was for identical inputs , with a minimum of special formatting .",
