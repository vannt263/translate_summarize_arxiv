    "this talk describes the results of a recent work  @xcite , where we proposed a nonstandard way to constrain the angular momentum @xmath1 of a ( anti)quark with flavor @xmath2 . in order to do this",
    ", we adopted an assumption  @xcite , motivated by model calculations and theoretical considerations , that connects @xmath1 to the sivers transverse - momentum distribution ( tmd )  @xcite measured in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) .",
    "we showed that this assumption is compatible with existing data , and allows us to derive estimates of @xmath1 in fair agreement with other `` standard '' extractions .",
    "the total angular momentum of a parton @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) at some scale @xmath4 can be computed as a specific moment of generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd )  @xcite @xmath5 the gpd @xmath6 corresponds to the familiar collinear parton distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath7 .",
    "the forward limit of the gpd @xmath8 does not correspond to any collinear pdf .",
    "it is possible to probe the function @xmath8 in experiments , but never in the forward limit  @xcite .",
    "assumptions are eventually necessary to constrain @xmath9 .",
    "this makes the estimate of @xmath1 particularly challenging .",
    "the only model - independent constraint is the scale - independent sum rule @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the anomalous magnetic moment of the parent nucleon .    denoting the sivers function by @xmath13",
    ", we propose this simple relation at a scale @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the integral of the sivers function over transverse momentum .",
    "this assumption is inspired by theoretical considerations  @xcite and by results of spectator models  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is a flavor - independent function , representing the effect of the qcd interaction of the outgoing quark with the rest of the nucleon .",
    "the name `` lensing function '' has been proposed by burkardt to denote @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "computations of the lensing function beyond the single - gluon approximation have been proposed in ref .",
    "it is likely that in more complex models the above relation is not preserved .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful and interesting to speculate on the consequences of this simple assumption .    the advantage of adopting the ansatz of eq",
    ".   is twofold : first , the value of the anomalous magnetic moment fixes the integral of the gpd @xmath0 and allows us to constrain the valence sivers function also outside the region where sidis data are available ; second , our ansatz allows us to obtain flavor - decomposed information on the @xmath18-dependence of the gpd @xmath0 and , ultimately , on quark and antiquark total angular momentum .",
    "this is an example of how assuming model - inspired connections between gpd and tmd can lead to powerful outcomes .",
    "to analyze sidis data , we use the same assumptions adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite : we neglect the effect of tmd evolution , which has been studied only recently  @xcite ; we assume a flavor- and scale - independent gaussian transverse - momentum distribution for all involved tmds , and we include the effect of the standard dglap evolution only in the collinear part of the parametrizing functions .",
    "neglecting @xmath19 flavors , we parametrize the sivers function in the following way : @xmath20 for @xmath21 , we use a similar function , excluding the last term .",
    "we used @xmath22 gev@xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is a free parameter that determines the transverse - momentum width .",
    "we imposed constraints on the parameters @xmath25 in order to respect the positivity bound for the sivers function  @xcite .",
    "we multiply the unpolarized pdf by @xmath26 to respect the predicted high-@xmath18 behavior of the sivers function  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the free parameter @xmath27 to allow for the presence of a node at @xmath28 , as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the lensing function we use the following ansatz @xmath29 the choice of this form",
    "is guided by model calculations  @xcite , by the large-@xmath18 limit of the gpd @xmath0  @xcite , and by the phenomenological analysis of the gpd @xmath0 proposed in ref .",
    "we checked _ a posteriori _ that there is no violation of the positivity bound on the gpd @xmath30 .",
    "we performed a combined @xmath31 fit to the nucleon anomalous magnetic moments ( for our present purposes , we take @xmath32 ) and the sivers asymmetry with identified hadrons from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we set the gluon sivers function to zero ( its influence through evolution is anyway limited ) and we chose @xmath33 gev .",
    "we fixed @xmath34 ( no nodes in the valence down and strange sivers functions ) .",
    "we explored several scenarios characterized by different choices of the parameters related to the strange quark . in all cases",
    ", we obtained very good values of @xmath31 per degree of freedom ( @xmath31/dof ) , around 1.34 .",
    "all fits lead to a negative sivers function for @xmath35 and large and positive for @xmath36 , in agreement with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the data are compatible with vanishing sea - quark contributions ( with large uncertainties ) . however , in the @xmath18 range where data exist , large sivers functions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are excluded , as well as large and negative for @xmath39 . the sivers function for @xmath40 is essentially unconstrained . the parameter @xmath24 is quite stable around 0.34 gev , as well as the strength of the lensing function @xmath41 around 1.86 gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is typically around 0.4 .",
    "it turns out @xmath43 , so there is little room for a node in the up sivers function , also because of the constraint imposed by the anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "our results for the sivers function are comparable with other extractions  @xcite .",
    "the results for the forward limit of the gpd @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] ; they also turn out qualitatively similar to available extractions  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath18 at the scale @xmath44 gev@xmath23 for @xmath45 from top to bottom , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty bands are produced by statistical errors on the fit parameters.,width=226 ]",
    "using eq .  , we can compute the total longitudinal angular momentum carried by each flavor @xmath46 and @xmath21 at our initial scale @xmath44 gev@xmath23 . using the standard evolution equations for the angular momentum ( at leading order , with 3 flavors only , and @xmath47 mev )",
    ", we obtain the following results at @xmath48 gev@xmath23 :      the first symmetric error is statistical and related to the errors on the fit parameters , while the second asymmetric error is theoretical and reflects the uncertainty introduced by other possible scenarios . in the present approach , we can not include the ( probably large ) systematic error due to the rigidity of the functional form in eqs .   and .",
    "the bias induced by the choice of the functional form may affect in particular the determination of the sea quark angular momenta , since they are not directly constrained by the values of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "our present estimates ( at @xmath48 gev@xmath23 ) agree well with other estimates ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : jujd ] ) , particularly with those ones based on the extraction of the gpd @xmath0  @xcite and on lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "our study indicates a total contribution to the nucleon spin from quarks and antiquarks of @xmath50 , of which 85% is carried by the up quark .     and",
    "@xmath51 compared with measurements of refs .",
    "@xcite and with other estimates based on gpd extractions from refs .",
    "@xcite ( the values based on the parametrization  @xcite are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , on lattice simulations  @xcite , and on some model calculations  @xcite.,width=718 ]    our approach can be used also to estimate the size of the total angular momentum carried by the gluons . in this case , we expect the lensing function to be different from that of the quarks .",
    "however , our extraction leaves little room for a nonzero gluon sivers function , since the quark sivers function already saturates the so - called burkardt sum rule  @xcite .",
    "if the sivers function of the gluons is zero , our reasoning allows us to conclude that @xmath52 is also zero , independent of the details of the lensing function .",
    "this would lead to a value of @xmath53 at 4 gev@xmath23 .",
    "however , these considerations are strongly affected by the uncertainties on the sea - quark sivers functions outside the @xmath18 range where data exists .",
    "direct measurements of the sea - quark and gluon sivers functions are therefore highly necessary .    at this point",
    ", we add a remark on the effect of tmd evolution on the sivers function .",
    "the discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the inclusion of tmd - evolution effects might lead to larger values of the sivers function at the starting scale @xmath54 .",
    "if this were the case , we would need to compensate the effect by a smaller size of the lensing function in order to have an agreement with the anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "however , this will have a negligible net effect on the results for @xmath1 ."
