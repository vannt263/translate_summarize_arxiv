    "early in the 1980 s , you & cheng ( 1980 ) mentioned that , when relativistic electrons pass through a dense gas region , the radiation produced by the cerenkov effect will be concentrated into a narrow waveband @xmath0 , very near to the intrinsic atomic or molecular wavelength position @xmath1 ( @xmath2 denote the corresponding upper and lower levels respectively )",
    ". therefore it looks more like an atomic emission line ( for gas composed of atoms ) and/or molecular line ( for molecular gas ) , rather than a continuum .",
    "they called it the `` cerenkov emission line '' . later",
    ", they presented a series of formulae to describe the properties of the peculiar cerenkov line ( you , kiang and chengs , 1984 , 1986 ) .",
    "elegant experimental confirmation of cerenkov line in @xmath3 , @xmath4 gas , and @xmath5 vapor using a @xmath6 @xmath7-ray source has been obtained in the laboratory ( xu et al .",
    "1981 , 1988 , 1989 ) . by use of the fast coincidence technique",
    ", they found the line emission at the expected directions , wavelengths and plane of polarization .",
    "it has been emphasized ( you et al .",
    "1986 ) that the cerenkov emission line is not a real line in the precise meaning due to the following features : ( i ) it is rather broad , for a dense gas with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the calculated linewidth of cerenkov @xmath10 is @xmath11 ; ( ii ) generally , the line profile is asymmetric , being steep on the blue side and flat on the red side ; ( iii ) its peak is not precisely at @xmath12 , but slightly red - shifted , we call this the `` cerenkov line redshift '' , so as to distinguish it from other types of redshift mechanisms ( doppler , gravitational , compton etc . ) ; ( iv ) it is polarized if the relativistic electrons have an anisotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the schematic profile of the cerenkov line @xmath13 is shown in fig.1 , where the profile of the normal emission line @xmath14 produced by a spontaneous transition process ( recombination - cascade and/or collisional excitation ) is also presented for comparison .    here",
    ", we emphasize the special importance of point ( iii ) .",
    "it is the cerenkov line - redshift which strengthens the emergent intensity of the cerenkov emission line .",
    "the reason is easy to understand . for an optically thick dense gas ,",
    "the emergent line flux is determined both by the emission and the absorption.the absorption mechanisms for the normal lines ( recombination - cascade and collisional excitation ) and for the cerenkov lines are extremely different .",
    "the line - intensity @xmath15 of a normal line is greatly weakened by the large resonance absorption @xmath16 due to the fact that the normal line is located at the position of the intrinsic wavelength @xmath17 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "where @xmath16 is very large , @xmath18 ( in the extreme case of a very dense gas , the emergent flux has a continuum with black body spectrum , and the line intensity @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , the cerenkov line , located at @xmath20 because of the small `` cerenkov line - redshift '' ( generally , @xmath21 , or the apparent `` velocity '' v a few hundred km / sec ) can avoid the strong line absorption @xmath22 because @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the cerenkov line intensity @xmath24 is only affected by a very small photoelectric absorption @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which means that the photons of the cerenkov line can easily escape from deep inside a dense gas cloud .",
    "the depth scale is @xmath27 , causing a strong emergent intensity @xmath24 only if the density of fast electrons @xmath28 is large enough . in other words , the dense gas appears to be more `` transparent '' for the cerenkov lines than for the normal lines , which makes it possible for the cerenkov line mechanism to dominate over the normal line emission in some physical situations .",
    "such a new line emission mechanism has a potential importance for high energy astrophysics , particularly in x - ray astronomy .",
    "solar flares , qsos and other agns etc",
    ". would be the first candidates .",
    "it is known that there definitely exist abundant relativistic electrons and dense gas regions in these objects , which provide the right conditions for producing the cerenkov line - like radiation .",
    "you et al . tried to explain a series of particular observation characteristics of the broad lines of qsos and seyfert1 galaxies by use of the new mechanism .",
    "moderate successes have been obtained , at least qualitatively , e.g. ( 1 ) the anomalous line - intensity ratios ( the steep balmer decrement , the small ratio @xmath29 , etc.)(you & cheng 1987 ) ; ( 2 ) the small redshift and red - asymmetry of the broad @xmath30 line with respect to civ @xmath31 ( cheng et al . 1990 ) ; ( 3 ) the different lag times @xmath32 of the high - ionized lines , e.g. civ and the low - ionized lines , e.g. mgii @xmath33 , @xmath30 , with respect to the flare of the continuum from the central source .",
    "the progress in the study of qsos and agns in recent years , both in theories and observations mean that we can now make qualitative statements on the contribution of the cerenkov line mechanism to the broad lines of agns .",
    "the latest observations which seem favorable to that cerenkov line mechanism were provided by asca observations of seyfert1 galaxies , which show an iron @xmath34 broad line with a markedly asymmetric profiles ( tanaka , et al .",
    "1995 , k. nandra , et al .",
    "1997 , turner , et al .",
    "the very steep blue side and strong red wing of broad @xmath34 line might be indicative of cerenkov line which encourages us to reexamine and improve the formulae system of the cerenkov line mechanism given in our previous papers ( you et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 ) , in a form which is convenient for astrophysical applications .",
    "in particular , we hope that the extended formulae can be applied to other species of multi - electron complex atoms and/or ions rather than hydrogen or hydrogenic atoms as in the previous paper , which are important for the study of the broad lines of agns , particularly in the x - ray band .",
    "another extension concerns the discussion on the cerenkov line redshift in sect .",
    "2 , where we give a generalized formula of the cerenkov line redshift and its simplified forms in the limiting cases of high and low gas - densities respectively .",
    "we find that the conclusion of asymmetry of the line - profile is correct only for a dense gas whose density is larger than a given critical value @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath36 , the profile becomes more symmetric .",
    "finally , our new formulae system is extended to the case of a non - uniform plane - parallel slab of emission gas ( @xmath37 etc . , where @xmath38 is the inner distance to the surface of the slab ) , which is also important in practice .",
    "the cgse system of units will be used throughout .",
    "this means , in particular , that all wavelengths in the following formulae will be in centimeters rather than @xmath39",
    ". the photon energy will be in ergs rather than kev .",
    "the essential point of the calculation of the spectrum of cerenkov radiation is the evaluation of the refractive index @xmath42 of the gaseous medium .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively from the necessary condition for producing cerenkov radiation , @xmath43 . at a given wavelength @xmath44 ,",
    "the larger the index @xmath42 , the easier the condition @xmath43 to be satisfied , and the stronger the cerenkov radiation at @xmath44 will be .",
    "therefore , in order to get the theoretical spectrum of the cerenkov radiation , it is necessary to calculate the refractive index @xmath40 and its dependence on @xmath44 , i.e. the dispersion curve @xmath45 . for a gaseous medium ,",
    "the calculation of the @xmath46 curve is easy to do .",
    "because our main interest is in the calculation of @xmath40 in the vicinity of @xmath12 , we must use the rigorous formula : @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 is the complex refractive index , the real part @xmath42 is the refractive index of the gas , the imaginary part @xmath50 is the extinction coefficient .",
    "@xmath51 is the number density of the atoms , and @xmath52 is the polarizability per atom .",
    "when the atoms are distributed over various energy levels with density @xmath53 in level @xmath54 , @xmath55 will be replaced by @xmath56 . according to quantum theory ,",
    "the atomic polarizability per atom in level @xmath54 is given as ( e.g. handbook of physics ed .",
    "condon and odishaw , 1958 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the charge and the mass of an electron , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the oscillation strength and the damping constant for the atomic line of frequency @xmath62 . substituting eq.(3 ) into eq.(1 ) , we get : @xmath63    because we are concerned with the neighborhood of a given atomic line @xmath12 , or the intrinsic frequency @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( the subscripts @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the upper and lower - levels corresponding to the intrinsic frequency @xmath64 ) , it follows that we only need to keep the two largest terms in the above summation , eq.(4 ) becomes : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is obtained from eq.(6 ) by replacing @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the absorption and emission oscillation strengths respectively , corresponding to the pair of energy levels @xmath73 of a given atom .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related to each other through the statistical weights @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the absorption oscillation strength @xmath71 is related with einstein s spontaneous emission coefficient @xmath77 as ( bethe & salpeter 1957 ) : @xmath78 and the damping constant @xmath79 is also related with einstein s coefficient @xmath77 as : @xmath80 using these relations , eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes : @xmath81 with @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84    from eq .",

    "( 11 ) is the @xmath91 dispersion formula , which we need .",
    "the @xmath91 dispersion curve can be easily obtained by the digital calculation by use of eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "however , as a good approximation , eq . ( 11 ) can be replaced by a simple analytic formula as follows . for convenience in comparing with the observations ,",
    "it is better to replace the frequency @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) by wavelength @xmath44 , let @xmath93 represent the wavelength displacement , and let @xmath94 denote the fractional displacement , @xmath95 because we are always interested in the calculation in the neighborhood of @xmath12 , @xmath96",
    ". therefore the small dimensionless quantity @xmath97 will be very useful in theoretical analysis ( e.g. the expansion series by use of the small quantity @xmath97 ) . replacing @xmath98 in eq .",

    "substituting this into eq .",

    "because the cerenkov line emission is not located in the exact position @xmath17 , it has a small redshift , so @xmath97 is not an indefinitely small quantity ( @xmath107 , in fact , at @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath17 , the cerenkov radiation disappears ) . in the actually effective range of @xmath97",
    ", we always have : @xmath109    for example , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 . inserting these value in eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we find that @xmath112 whenever @xmath113 ( equivalently , @xmath114 ) . on the other hand , under ordinary physical conditions",

    "a smaller @xmath51 will give a still lower limit of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the inequalities ( 14 ) always hold in the actually effective cerenkov line - width ( @xmath121 ) . for the other lines ,",
    "we obtain the same conclusion ( 14 ) , under similar considerations .",
    "thus we need only retain the terms of the lowest order of the small quantities @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq . (",
    "11 ) , and we obtain : @xmath124 @xmath125    substituting eq . ( 13 ) into eq .",
    "( 15 ) , finally we have the simplified approximate formulae : @xmath126 @xmath127    eqs.(16 ) are the approximate analytic formulae for @xmath42 and @xmath50 respectively . from eq .",
    "( 16 ) we see that @xmath40 varies as @xmath128 .",
    "we shall see below that the cerenkov spectral emissivity varies approximately as @xmath129 , so @xmath130 .",
    "however , the absorption varies as @xmath131 , i.e. the absorption decreases with @xmath0 more rapidly than the emissivity .",
    "that is why we have a net cerenkov radiation at the position @xmath132 , if @xmath0 is not approaching to zero .",
    "the calculated @xmath46 and @xmath133 curves are shown in fig .",

    "the waveband @xmath135 is so narrow(e.g .",

    "we emphasize that our derivation from eq .",
    "( 4 ) to eq .",
    "( 16 ) is limited to gas composed of hydrogen and/or hydrogen - like atoms(ions ) , e.g. @xmath136 , etc .",
    "however , a necessary extention to other multi - electron atoms ( ions ) can easily be done when we notice that eq .",
    "( 3 ) represents the contribution of an electron lying in the atomic energy level @xmath54 to the atomic polarizability @xmath137 .",

    "however , most of these equations are valid for the multi - electron complex atoms only if the following replacement is made : @xmath160      another important extension , which we would like to emphasize in this paper , is related to the possible application of cerenkov line - like emission in x - ray astronomy because the waveband of some cerenkov lines of complex atoms ( ions ) , particularly the heavy elements , is in the x - ray range .",
    "a possible application of the cerenkov line mechanism in the x - ray band may be a new explanation for the origin of the broad @xmath161 line of fe ions observed in seyfert agns in recent years .",
    "for convenience in comparing with the observations in the x - ray waveband , it is better to replace the wavelength @xmath44 in the formulae given above by the frequency @xmath92 , or equivalently , by the photon energy @xmath162 .",
    "this is easy to do without any remarkable changes in above formulae .",
    "we notice that the dimensionless small quantity @xmath97 in eq .",

    "for an isotropic velocity distribution of the relativistic electrons as in normal astrophysical conditions , the cerenkov radiation will also be isotropic(the definite angular distribution of the cerenkov emission disappears when the relativistic electrons have an isotropic distribution of velocities ) .",

    "we have shown that fluorescence is not a ` unique ' mechanism of the line - emission of the low - ionization iron in the x - ray band . another line mechanism which can produce",
    "the @xmath224 @xmath34 line is the cerenkov line - like emission , as described in this paper . for a very dense gas , optically thick for the continuum",

    "the cerenkov line will be strong to match the observation when the density of relativistic electrons in blr is high enough .",
    "therefore this kind of line emission might be a new possible mechanism to attack the @xmath449 @xmath34 problem of agns .",
    "we expect that some puzzles of @xmath34 line of iron could be resolved in this way(e.g .",
    "the observed strange correlations of the light curves and the fluxes between the @xmath34 line and x - ray continuum radiation ) , even though there remain a lot of problems to be solved .",
