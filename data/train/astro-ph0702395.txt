    "the nearby accreting t tauri star , tw hya is oriented with its rotation axis almost along our line of sight , and the surrounding accretion disk approximately in the plane of the sky ( krist  2000 ) providing a good opportunity to study its accretion and wind characteristics .",
    "the discovery of a hot , fast wind from this star ( dupree  2005 ) calls for a determination of the mass loss rate , wind speed , and temperature in the outer atmosphere , and its relation to the mass accretion rate .",
    "a sufficiently robust stellar wind may lead to optical jets , could remove angular momentum from the star ( matt & pudritz 2005 ) , contribute to the opacity needed for x - ray absorption ( flaccomio  2003 ) , and influence the diminution of dust in accretion disks ( alexander  2005 ) .",
    "the chromospheric lines of h-   and he  i 10830 are reported here for tw hya to characterize the flux variations and line profiles .",
    "detailed models of wind - sensitive line profiles of h-  and he i ( 10830 ) are presented for expanding semi - empirical atmospheric models using the avrett / loeser pandora code for full non - lte effects .",
    "these models constrain both the atmospheric structure and the mass loss rate implied by the observed wind - scattered line profiles .",
    "tw hya was observed continuously for 3 successive nights in april 2006 at the magellan / clay telescope using the mike echelle spectrograph .",
    "additional optical spectra were taken previously in april 2004 .",
    "the slit width of 0.75 arcsec yielded a resolution of 36,000 near h- .",
    "infrared spectra of he  i 10830 were taken at keck  ii using the nirspec infrared spectrograph in may 2002 and july 2005 , and reported elsewhere ( dupree  2005 ) .",
    "profiles of h-  showed substantial variation in flux and radial velocity over the course of all observations , ( see fig . 1 , 2 , and 3 ) . the p cygni profiles of he 10830 showed variations in the wind absorption among the 3 observations suggesting changes in the wind structure .",
    "the extent of absorption reaches @xmath1300  in both h  and he i. since h-  and @xmath210830 are chromospheric lines , these velocities are supersonic and may be an indication of shocks and transient events .",
    "the photospheric escape velocity is @xmath3500 , but at a distance of 1r@xmath4 above the surface , the escape speed approaches 300  so a small extension of the atmosphere could easily lead to mass loss .",
    "the pandora code is a general purpose non - lte atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis code ( avrett & loeser 2003 ) .",
    "we invoke a model atmosphere which is spherical and expanding .",
    "pandora takes into account the time - independent optically - thick non - lte transfer of line and continuum radiation for multilevel atoms and multiple stages of ionization including partial frequency redistribution . in calculating the line source functions we include the effects of atmospheric outflows .",
    "multi - level atoms ( 3 levels for hydrogen , and 5 levels for helium , plus the continua ) were used .",
    "the starting semi - empirical models for the observations consist of temperature , density , and velocity and their radial dependence ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . in this calculation , the run of temperature and density are comparable to solar values ; the density at 30,000k is consistent with values from the diagnostic c ii lines ( 2326 ) in tw hya that indicate n@xmath5 @xmath3 4@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 . the maximum coronal temperature is taken as the value ( @xmath9  k ) suggested by the emission measure distribution derived from chandra x - ray spectra ( kastner  2002 ) .",
    "the velocity profile is constructed to match the velocities observed in the lines and is close to mass - conserving .",
    "the velocities and the radial height scales are varied in order to fit the observed absorption line profiles .",
    "the strengths of emission lines observed in t tauri stars are substantially influenced by the hot plasma produced on the stellar surface as a result of the accretion flow .",
    "thus we have focussed , not on reproducing the emission flux profile which is difficult to predict , but rather on the effects of the wind scattering on the line profile .",
    "a continuous set of echelle spectra of tw hya , taken with mike on magellan2 in april 2006 reveals systematic variations in the flux , velocity , and the profile of the h-  emission line .",
    "absorption features recur at high velocity in the wind .",
    "additional spectra from 2004 show a similar repetitive pattern .",
    "the flux variation indicates that accretion is not uniform and is consistent with the photometric variation found by lawson and crause ( 2005 ) which they attribute to the presence of accretion hot spots on the stellar surface .",
    "absorption ` notches ' appear on the short wavelength side of the h-  line at velocities near @xmath10100 and @xmath10200 .",
    "similar notches appear in the he  i 10830 profiles too .",
    "the fact that similar h-  profiles ( with notches ) occur in our data from 2004 and 2006 indicates stable atmospheric structures .",
    "an obvious source creating such structures is a magnetic field that configures the chromosphere .",
    "semi - empirical models of the atmosphere have been constructed to compute the scattering line profiles using the pandora code .",
    "the wind absorption appears to vary in both h-  and he 10830 , and will require multiple models .",
    "the first approximations shown here for h-  and he suggest that the ( spherical ) mass outflow rate is on the order of 5 @xmath6 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 .",
    "this value is comparable to the accretion rate indicated by h-@xmath13 ( muzerolle   2000 ) of 4@xmath610@xmath11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 and would appear to require a very efficient mechanism if the wind is powered only by accretion .",
