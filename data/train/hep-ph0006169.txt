    "the full understanding of the phase structure of qcd as the theory of strong interactions has become an important issue since the discovery of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the possibility that high temperature qcd could show different properties from the theory at zero temperature has been addressed already in @xcite .",
    "new features are also predicted for the theory at very high and intermediate baryon density @xcite , @xcite",
    ".    an essential role is played by the chiral symmetry which is supposed to be broken by the vacuum structure of the theory .",
    "thus , before considering the high temperature phase transition with the chiral symmetry restoration , one has to deal with the problem of determining a nonzero order parameter which indicates the chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) at zero temperature and density .",
    "a strong simplification is obtained by considering the effective theory described by a linear @xmath0 model of scalar mesons coupled to an isospin multiplet of fermions with the same chiral symmetry group of the original action",
    ". then csb corresponds to a mexican hat - shaped effective potential and the order parameter is identified with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of one of the scalar fields .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) properties of a field theory such as the vacuum structure , can be analysed by means of the wilsonian renormalization group which generates a sequence of effective actions defined at some momentum scale @xmath1 , starting from the original action , by integrating out in the latter all the modes with frequency higher than @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the construction of a differential flow equation for the @xmath1-dependent action , generally known as exact renormalization group equation ( erge ) . in the past years many analytical and numerical approaches to the erge , applied to various theories , have been developed .",
    "two recent extensive reviews of this topic are @xcite and a detailed erge analysis of the chiral phase transition can be found in @xcite .    here",
    "we shall consider just the simple case of the csb at zero temperature employing the sharp cut - off version of the erge , namely the wegner - hougton equation @xcite .",
    "the cut - off dependence of the erge for the o(4 ) linear @xmath0-model has been addressed in@xcite where , however only the flow of the scalar potential is considered while the yukawa coupling is kept fixed .",
    "in addition to the yukawa coupling flow , we are particularly interested in the behavior of the field renormalization .",
    "in fact , if our model is really an effective theory which , at some scale , can naturally replace the original qcd action , then at this scale one expects the formation of the mesonic bound states characterized by a very small wave function renormalization function .",
    "the reduction of qcd to the quark - meson action has been analysed before and a review of it is given in @xcite .",
    "as expected the value of the scalar field renormalization is vanishingly small at the mesonic bound state formation scale which is found between 0.60 and 0.63 gev .",
    "then , the flow of the field renormalization deserves particular attention .",
    "the explicit form of the euclidean action at a scale @xmath1 is ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 @xmath4 is a flavor doublet and the summation over the index @xmath5 is extended to @xmath6 colors . no csb fermion mass term is included and the action is fully invariant under chiral transformations . the presence of csb depends on the shape of the o(4 ) symmetric potential @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the @xmath0 and @xmath11 renormalization functions .",
    "as long as @xmath7 has zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , we choose the following parametrization @xmath12 and consider the flow of the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 neglecting all the irrelevant operators that could be generated during the flow . in the presence of a nonvanishing vev @xmath15 , according to @xcite , we reparametrize the potential in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , recalling that @xmath13 can be expressed in term of these two parameters through the minimum condition .",
    "the purpose of this double choice is practical , we take the couple of parameters which corresponds to the simplest set of flow equations .    the wegner - houghton equation can be reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the @xmath1 dependent parameters in ( [ eq : leq ] ) , i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 or @xmath15 . in particular the equations for the parameters in the potential are deduced in @xcite , and the one for @xmath16 can be obtained by an analogous procedure .",
    "the equations for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ( which coincide as long as @xmath17 , according to the chiral simmetry ) are deduced following the procedure formulated in @xcite and already implemented in @xcite . in the following , the derivatives of @xmath9 and @xmath10 w.r.t .",
    "the fields , which are supposed to be small , are neglected .    the pion decay constant and the constituent fermion mass are two ir constraints for our equations .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath8 we have @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 gev , as initial conditions for the equations .",
    "if we start , according to @xcite , the flow at the uv scale @xmath20 gev with a convex potential ( @xmath21 ) , then at a certain scale @xmath22 , @xmath13 becomes negative generating a nonzero @xmath15 . in the following the three remaining initial conditions",
    "imposed are @xmath17 at the csb scale @xmath22 and a particular value for @xmath9 at the uv scale ( the symmetry requires @xmath23 at the uv scale ) .",
    "figure [ fig : uno ] shows , above @xmath22 ( fixed at the value @xmath27 gev ) , the flow of the scalar mass @xmath28 ( the subscript @xmath1 is omitted ) for two different initial values of @xmath29 and , below @xmath22 , the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the curves for @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the two cases are almost superposed indicating insensitivity to the uv condition on @xmath32 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 is suggested by an ir stability criterion . in order to use a particular value of quark mass , @xmath24 , as the initial condition for the running quantity @xmath31 defined above",
    ", @xmath31 must be practically flat around @xmath33 .",
    "the same criterion should apply to @xmath34 but , since @xmath34 is smaller than @xmath24 , we find that @xmath30 at the scale @xmath35 is already a stable parameter . after fixing the ir condition @xmath36 with @xmath37 gev",
    ", we have considered the ratio @xmath38 , plotted vs. @xmath22 in figure [ fig : due ] for two different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the stability requirement indicates that @xmath22 should not be smaller than @xmath39 gev .    in figures [ fig",
    ": tre ] and [ fig : quattro ] the other running parameters are displayed for the same two initial values of @xmath32 that have been used in figure [ fig : uno ] .",
    "it should be noted the small running of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in the range of @xmath1 considered , and their large values which are clearly nonperturbative . as shown in figure [ fig : quattro ] ,",
    "when going from the uv to the ir scale , the field renormalizations grow and , below @xmath22 , @xmath32 and @xmath42 increase differently .",
    "since reasonably we expect , for the pion physics at scales around @xmath43 gev , field renormalization functions close to the unity , we must require very small values at @xmath20 gev .",
    "namely we used @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the two cases here considered in figures [ fig : uno],[fig : tre ] , [ fig : quattro ] .",
    "higher curves for @xmath46 correspond to the former case , lower curves to the latter .",
    "the approximation here employed for the erge has been sufficient for exploring a nonperturbative region ( note that , as explained in @xcite , the renormalized couplings which include the field renormalization effect , are larger than those in figure [ fig : tre ] ) and it has yielded a very small ( vanishing ) scalar field renormalization around @xmath47 gev .",
