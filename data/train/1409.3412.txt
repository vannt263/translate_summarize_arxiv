    "in 1958 anderson showed , within the independent electron framework , that the presence of a finite concentration of linear uncorrelated disorder completely inhibits the quasiparticle propagation in one - dimension ( 1d ) and two - dimension ( 2d ) , giving rise to a saturation of its mean - square displacement and an exponential decrease of the transmissivity of plane waves with system size  @xcite .",

    "a different and novel concept that has gained much recent attention is that of @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "it is based on the seminal work of bender and coworkers  @xcite , who showed that non - hermitian hamiltonians are capable of displaying a purely real eigenvalue spectrum , provided the system is invariant with respect to the combined operations of parity ( @xmath1 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) symmetry . for one - dimensional systems",
    "the @xmath0 requirement leads to the condition that the imaginary part of the potential term in the hamiltonian be an odd function , while its real part be even . in a @xmath0-symmetric system",
    ", the effects of loss and gain can balance each other and , as a result , give rise to a bounded dynamics .",
    "the system thus described can experience a spontaneous symmetry breaking from a @xmath0-symmetric phase ( all eigenvalues real ) to a broken phase ( at least two complex eigenvalues ) , as the imaginary part of the potential is increased . in the case of optics , the paraxial wave equation has the form of a schrdinger equation and , as a consequence , the potential is proportional to the index of refraction .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry requirements lead to the condition that the real part of the refractive index be an even function , while the imaginary part be an odd function in space . to date",
    ", numerous @xmath0-symmetric systems have been explored in several fields , from optics  @xcite , electronic circuits  @xcite , solid - state and atomic physics  @xcite , to magnetic metamaterials  @xcite , among others . the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking phenomenon has been observed in several experiments  @xcite .    it is known that a 1d simple periodic lattice with homogeneous couplings and endowed with gain and loss , displaying in this way @xmath0-symmetry , is always in the broken phase of this symmetry and does not have a stable parameter window  @xcite . for finite @xmath0-symmetrical lattices , it has been shown that @xmath0-symmetry is preserved inside a parameter window whose size shrinks with the number of lattice sites  @xcite . if one breaks the homogeneity of the couplings , and consider an infinite binary lattice , it was shown that there is a well - defined parameter window where @xmath0-symmetry is preserved  @xcite .",
    "a previous study of the effect of @xmath0-symmetry on anderson localization , carried out on a ( continuous ) 2d square optical lattice , suggests that the presence of @xmath0-symmetry enhances light localization  @xcite .",
