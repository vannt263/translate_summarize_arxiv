    "we measured the flux and equivalent widths of the several observed lines .",

    "* bushouse et al . 2002 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* arribas et al . 2004 ) ) and are believed to be powered by a combination of nuclear activity and star - formation ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 1988 ) ) suggests that the fraction of agns inreases with the luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "in fact , the optical study of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kim , veilleux & sanders ( 1998 ) ) , hereafter kvs98 , indicates that for lirgs , agns are present in about 32% of their galaxies , while for ulirgs , agns ( sey . 1 , 2 and liners )",
    "dominate and are present in 70% of the systems . in many cases agns and starbursts",
    "coexist , making it even harder to understand the relative importance of nuclear activity and star - formation in lirgs and ulirgs .    the main goal of this project in to understand if diagnostics based in the near infrared spectra yield the same results of kvs98 .",
    "do we find the same relative frequency of starbursts and agns as a function of luminosity ?",
    "what is the importance of the merger stage and the frequency of agns ?",
    "we used the observed nearir spectra to determine the activity class of our galaxies independently of their optical classification .",
    "the presence of the pah lines at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3 @xmath2 m are strong indications for the presence of starbursts since the pah molecules are destroyed ( or hidden ) by nuclear activity ( agn ) .",
    "the presence of the [ ne v ] line at 14.3 and 24.3@xmath2 m is a strong evidence for an agn since it takes 97 ev to ionize [ neiv ] and this energy can not come from ob stars .",
    "the agns also exhibit a featurefree continuum below 5@xmath2 m that can not be found in starbursts .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we investigate the strength of the 7.7 pah emission line vs. the [ nev ] 14.3 @xmath2 m emission line and find that starbursts and agn s are clearly separated .",
    "we designed other diagnostic diagrams using the [ oiv ] at 25.9 @xmath2 m and [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath2 m .",
    "all these diagrams succesfully separate galaxies with agn activity from those powered by starbursts .     emission lines . strong 7.7@xmath2 m pah lines are seen in agn s , composites and starbursts , possibly indicating that star formation and nuclear activity might coexist in a single galaxy.,width=326 ]",
    "our main findings are:(i ) most agns are also advanced mergers .",
    "this is in agreement with the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ) scenario to explain lirgs and ulirgs ; ( ii ) we find that for @xmath3 ( lirgs ) starbursts dominate with 75% ( 25% agns ) , while for @xmath4 ( ulirgs ) , agns and composite systems dominate with 92% .",
    "we thus find a strong evidence for the so called luminosity dependence ; ( iii ) based on this small sample we find no evidence that advanced mergers are preferentially found in more luminous systems .",
    "in other words , we can not claim that the infrared luminosity is a precise tracer of merger activity .",
    "maybe a larger sample can shed some light on this issue .",
    "many of these galaxies show a deeep silicate absorption and this indicates a large optical depth to the nucleus .",
    "we thus suspect that the agn contribution for many of the galaxies in the sample may be larger .",
    "this would imply that agns remain hidden even at mid - ir wavelengths ."
