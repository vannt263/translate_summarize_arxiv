    "recent lattice simulations lead to many new theoretical insights into the dynamics of low - energy gluon modes  @xcite . in the quenched approximation aspects of confinement emerge from studies of the gluonic spectrum produced by static color sources . in the following we will focus on the pure gluon dynamics ( the role of dynamical quarks in the screening of confining gluonic strings has recently been studied in  @xcite ) .",
    "lattice studies indicate that with relative separations between two color sources , @xmath1 , the ground state energy obeys casimir scaling  @xcite .",
    "this means that the spectrum of gluon modes generated by static color sources depends on the dimension of the color representation of the sources rather than on the n - ality of the representation ( which is related to the transformation property of a representation with respect to the group center )  @xcite .",
    "for example , for two sources in the fundamental representation , lattice computations show , as expected , that energy grows linearly with the separation between the sources .",
    "however , also for sources in the adjoint representation ( with n - ality of zero ) , lattice produces a linearly rising potential , even though for vanishing n - ality screening is expected to saturate the potential .",
    "screening comes from the production of gluon pairs ( glueballs ) which vanishes in the limit of a large number of colors .",
    "casimir scaling is thus telling us that there is , at least in the energy range relevant for hadronic phenomenology , a simple , universal ( source independent ) description of the confining string .    the lattice spectrum of gluonic modes generated by sources in the fundamental representation , _",
    "i.e. _ , a static quark - antiquark ( @xmath0 ) pair , has been extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy , which as a function of the @xmath0 separation is well represented by the cornell , `` coulomb+linear '' potential and the spectrum of excited gluonic modes have been computed .",
    "the excited gluonic modes lead to excited adiabatic potentials between the sources in the sense of the born - oppenheimer approximation with the quark sources and gluonic field corresponding to the slow and fast degrees of freedom , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the gluonic wave functional of these modes can be classified analogously to that of a diatomic molecule .",
    "the good quantum numbers are : @xmath2 which give the total gluon spin projection along the @xmath0 axis , @xmath3 which correspond to the product of gluon parity and charge conjugation , and @xmath4 which describes parity under reflection in a plane containing the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the ground state corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "the lattice calculations show that the first excited state has the @xmath6 symmetry ( for @xmath7 , @xmath4 states are degenerate ) and thus has @xmath8 .",
    "the lattice spectrum of gluonic excitations is well reproduced by the bag model  @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of the model that makes this possible is the boundary condition , which requires the longitudinal component of the chromo - electric and transverse components of the chromo - magnetic field of the free gluon inside the cavity to vanish at the boundary of the bag .",
    "this results in the te mode with pseudo - vector , @xmath9 , quantum numbers having the lowest energy , which leads to the @xmath6 adiabatic potential being the lightest from among the excited gluonic states in the @xmath0 system . in another model , the non - relativistic flux tube model  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath10 quantum numbers of the low - lying gluon mode result from associating a negative parity and a positive charge conjugation to the lowest order transverse phonon ( unlike that of a vector field ) .",
    "this also results in the @xmath6 quantum numbers for the first excited adiabatic potential . finally in a qcd",
    "based quasi - particle picture the intrinsic quantum numbers of the quasi - gluons are , @xmath11 , that of a transverse vector field  @xcite . if the first excited adiabatic potential between @xmath0 sources is associated with a single quasi - gluon excitation and this quasi - gluon interacts via normal two - body forces with the sources , then , one expects the quasi - gluon ground state wave function to be in an orbital @xmath12-wave , which , in turn , leads to the net @xmath10 and the @xmath13 symmetry for this state .",
    "this is in contradiction with the lattice data as noted in  @xcite .",
    "the bag model and the flux tube model give the right ordering of the spectrum of low lying gluonic excitations , even though they are based on very different microscopic representations of the gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "there are indications from lattice simulations of various gauge models that the adiabatic potentials approach that of the flux tube , or better string - like spectrum for @xmath0 separations",
    "larger then @xmath14  @xcite , however , the situation for qcd is far less clear  @xcite . in particular , for large separations between the sources the splitting between nearby string excitations is expected to fall off as @xmath15 .",
    "the lattice results indicate , however , that the spacing between the adiabatic potentials is close to constant . at distances @xmath16",
    "the flux tube model becomes inadequate while qcd is expected to become applicable .",
    "for example as @xmath17 , the coulomb potential between the quark and the anti - quark in the color octet is repulsive , and , indeed , the results of lattice calculations do seem to have that trend .",
    "the bag model attempts to combine the perturbative and long range , collective dynamics by using a free fled theory inside a spherically symmetric bag and deforming the bag to a string like shape as the separation between the sources increases . a self consistent treatment of bag and gluon degrees of freedom is , however , lacking .",
    "another model which aims at relating the string - like excitations at large @xmath0 separations with the qcd gluon degrees of freedom is the gluon chain model  @xcite and versions thereof  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that as the separation between the sources increases pairs of constituent gluons are created to screen the charges in such a way that the fock space is dominated by a state with a number of constituent gluons , which grows with the @xmath0 separation .",
    "recently , support for the gluon chain model came from lattice studies of the coulomb energy of the @xmath0 pair  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , at fixed @xmath18 , coulomb energy bounds the true exact ( from wilson line ) energy from above .",
    "the coulomb energy is defined as the expectation value of the coulomb potential in a state obtained by adding the @xmath0 pair to the exact ground state of the vacuum , _ i.e. _ , without taking into account vacuum polarization by the sources .",
    "the addition of sources changes the vacuum wave functional by creating constituent gluons as described by the gluon chain model .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the structure of the @xmath0 state in terms of physical , transverse gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , we focus on the importance of constituent gluons in describing the excited adiabatic potentials . for simplicity and to make our arguments clearer , we concentrate on excited adiabatic potentials of single , @xmath19 , symmetry . a description of the complete spectrum of excited potentials will be presented in a following paper .",
    "our main finding here is that a description based on a single ( few ) constituent gluon excitation is valid up to @xmath20 , with the gluon chain turning in , most likely , at asymptotically large @xmath0 separations .",
    "consequently , we show how the gluon chain model can emerge in the basis of transverse gluon fock space .    in section",
    "ii we review the coulomb gauge formulation of qcd and introduce the fock space of quasi - gluons . in section  iii",
    "we review the computation of the ground state and the excited @xmath21 potentials .",
