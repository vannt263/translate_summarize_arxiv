    "the dynamic response of ising systems under positive pulsed fields has recently been studied extensively employing computer simulation . in particular ,",
    "some interesting divergent growth of relaxation time and finite time scaling behaviour was observed near the order - disorder transition point of the ising model for `` positive pulses '' , where the pulsed field in the ordered phase is in the direction of order @xcite .",
    "here we report the computer simulation study of the same system where the pulsed field is `` negative '' , i.e in opposition to the existing order having equilibrium magnetization @xmath2 , below the order - disorder transition point . due to the application of a negative pulse @xmath0 in an ordered equilibrium phase ,",
    "the down spin domains start growing as long as the pulse is present . depending on the number and size of these down spin domains at the time of withdrawal of the pulse , either they further grow to reach the other equivalent ordered phase with reversed magnetization ( @xmath3 ) or reduce to settle down in the original ordered phase with magnetization ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath4 taken by the system to reach either of these equilibrium states depends on the strength ( @xmath0 ) and duration ( @xmath1 ) of the pulse , as well as on the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "it may be mentioned that a number of studies have been made ( see for example @xcite,@xcite ) on the growth of negative spin domains in a kinetic ising model when an ordered state is suddenly subjected to a negative field , where the time variation of the field is step function like .",
    "the applicability of the classical theory of nucleation by becker and dring @xcite has also been investigated extensively here .",
    "however , our problem differs from these studies because the applied field is withdrawn after a finite interval of time .",
    "the minimum amplitude of the field required to trigger a spin reversal is non - vanishing if @xmath1 is finite . as we go on to increase the pulse width , in the limit @xmath6 we recover the results for a field of ` step - function ' like nature ( in time ) where even an infinitesimally small amplitude of the field is sufficient to trigger the spin - reversal .",
    "we have studied the `` phase diagram '' in the @xmath7 plane for the spin - reversal transition ( from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) in a monte carlo simulation using glauber dynamics @xcite and also from the mean field equation of motion . in the kinetic ising case",
    "we have also studied the variation or growth of the relaxation time @xmath4 as one approaches this phase boundary .",
    "we observe clear divergence of the relaxation time as the phase boundary is approached , indicating the spin - reversal transition to be a clear thermodynamic transition with a divergent correlation length .",
    "in the monte carlo study , we take an ising system of size @xmath10 on a square lattice with nearest neighbour interaction without any disorder .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath11    where @xmath12 represents the ising spins at lattice site @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the nearest neighbour interaction strength . the time dependent external magnetic field @xmath15 is applied as a pulse for a short duration @xmath1 :    @xmath16    the pulsed field is applied after the original ising system comes to an equilibrium ordered phase ( corresponding to @xmath17 , the order - disorder transition temperature ) .",
    "the time @xmath18 in ( 2 ) is thus much larger than the relaxation time of the pure ising system without any perturbation .",
    "the direction of the pulsed field ( @xmath19 ) is opposite to the existing order or average equilibrium magnetization @xmath8 existing at times before @xmath18 .",
    "before the pulsed magnetic field is applied , the system is brought to equilibrium which is characterized by temperature only .",
    "the system evolves according to the glauber single spin flip dynamics .",
    "one complete sweep through the entire lattice is defined as one monte carlo step ( mcs ) or one unit of time @xmath20 .",
    "after the system reaches its equilibrium the pulse of strength @xmath0 is applied and is withdrawn after a finite time interval @xmath1 .",
    "after that the system is left to itself to come to equilibrium and is attracted or evolves towards either of the two equally likely equilibria ( determined by the temperature @xmath5 ) having different order parameter values or magnetization .",
    "unless the system is above the critical temperature of the unperturbed system ( @xmath21 ) , majority of the spins will point to a particular direction .",
    "suppose , before the application of the pulsed field the magnetization of the system is @xmath22 .",
    "now either by tuning the pulse width @xmath1 or the pulse height @xmath0 we can perturb the system in such a manner that after the withdrawal of the pulse the system chooses to go over to the other equilibrium state , characterized by the magnetization @xmath9 .",
    "we call it a `` spin - reversal '' transition when the sign of equilibrium magnetization is flipped by the application of the negative pulse",
    ". we have studied in our monte carlo calculations the phase diagram for such spin - reversal transition in the @xmath23 plane at a fixed temperature ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have also looked at the relaxation behaviour of the dynamics of such systems ( in particular the relaxation time @xmath4 for the average magnetization ) as one approaches the phase boundary .",
    "typical number of samples ( monte carlo seeds ) taken for averaging the data points is 10 .",
    "we have also solved numerically the mean field equation of motion @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetization ( per site ) at time @xmath20 and @xmath15 is given by ( 2 ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that all possible combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not give rise to the spin - reversal transition at a particular temperature .",
    "fig . 1 shows how the transition can be brought about by increasing @xmath1 for a fixed value of @xmath0 at a constant temperature .",
    "2 shows similar effect by increasing @xmath0 while keeping @xmath1 and @xmath5 constant .    at any particular temperature ( @xmath24 ) there exists a combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which just manages to induce the spin - reversal transition",
    "this @xmath23 curve is given by the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "3 . the inner side or the axes side of the curves corresponds to the original phase , whereas one gets `` spin - reversed '' phase for all the combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 outside the phase boundary .",
    "the limitation arising out of the discrete time simulations force the value of @xmath1 to start from 1 , i.e one mcs . with this kind of technique for estimating the critical value of pulsed field strength @xmath27 ,",
    "the estimate of the phase boundary for @xmath28 is not possible .",
    "the phase boundaries tend to touch the abscissa at large values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is well anticipated because even with an infinitesimally small strength , a negative field will eventually give rise to spin - reversal if applied for sufficiently long time .",
    "an important observation can be made from the series of figures shown in fig .",
    "4 . in figs .",
    "4(a)-(c ) the time series plots of @xmath26 are shown when @xmath0 is increased ( at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath5 ) to reach the phase boundary from below . in figs .",
    "4(d)-(f ) the phase boundary is approached from above by decreasing @xmath0 at the same value of @xmath1 and @xmath5 . in either case",
    ", it is clear that as one approaches the phase boundary for a particular temperature and pulse width , the ( relaxation ) time taken by the system to reach its final equilibrium state increases .",
    "this prompts us to define the relaxation time @xmath4 of the system as the time ( mcs ) taken by it to reach the final equilibrium state from the time of withdrawal of the pulse . in fig .",
    "5 , we look for the variation of the quantity @xmath4 with @xmath0 for a particular temperature and fixed pulse width . it is clearly seen that @xmath4 seems to diverge as we approach the phase boundary from either side for that particular temperature and pulse width .",
    "similar growth of @xmath4 is also observed while approaching the phase boundary by varying @xmath1 at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "such divergent growths of relaxation time clearly indicate the thermodynamic nature of the spin - reversal transition ( divergent correlation length ) . it may be mentioned here that due to very large scatter ( sometimes by order of magnitude ) in the values of @xmath4 for different monte carlo seeds ( otherwise thermodynamically identical samples ) , log averaging turned out to be a better choice than ordinary averaging of @xmath4 . the data for @xmath4 shown in fig .",
    "5 are obtained using log - averages for @xmath4 , thereby keeping the relative error less than @xmath29 .    the mean - field phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "since there is no fluctuation , there exists a finite coercive field .",
    "the spin reversal does not occur even for infinite pulse width ( @xmath6 ) , if the pulse height @xmath0 does not exceed the coercive field .",
    "the coercive field @xmath30 decreases as @xmath31 with increasing temperature in the mean field case , where @xmath32 in ( 3 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath33 free energy @xmath34 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "6 shows the variation of @xmath30 as a function of temperature . unlike the kinetic ising case",
    ", the mean field phase diagrams can be extended beyond @xmath1 = 1 .",
    "however since the @xmath35 function saturates to negative unity ( for large @xmath0 ) , the spin reversal can not occur by further increasing the magnitude of the negative field if it is not applied for sufficient time . from ( 3 ) we can write @xmath36dt \\approx -(m_0 + 1)dt$ ] .",
    "now @xmath37 should be sufficient to make the value of @xmath38 decrease from @xmath2 to 0 . at low temperatures ( @xmath39 )",
    "it requires @xmath40 while for higher temperatures spin reversal occurs for @xmath41 .",
    "using monte carlo simulations for ising system evolving under glauber dynamics ( with non - conserving order parameter ) , we have studied a new dynamic `` spin - reversal '' transition , where the system goes from one stable equilibrium to another due to the application of a pulsed field ( of finite duration ) opposite to the existing order of the system .",
    "we have determined the phase diagram for such a transition in the pulse strength ( @xmath0)-pulse width ( @xmath1 ) plane for a fixed temperature @xmath5 less than the order disorder transition temperature @xmath42 .",
    "we observe that the typical relaxation time @xmath4 tends to diverge as the phase boundary is approached , indicating a divergent correlation length associated with such dynamic transition .    in the kinetic ising model ,",
    "the transition is actually triggered by the eventual growth of the `` negative '' spin domains formed during the period when the negative field was `` on '' . according to the classical nucleation theory , number of droplets of size @xmath43",
    "is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a normalization constant . here the free energy for formation of a droplet is given by @xmath46 in @xmath47 dimensions , where @xmath48 is proportional to the surface tension . from the optimality of @xmath49 the estimated nucleation rate from becker - dring theory is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is some constant depending on temperature .",
    "equating the rate @xmath52 with the inverse pulse width @xmath1 one gets approximately @xmath53 in @xmath54 for the phase boundary .",
    "however , it can be checked from fig .",
    "3 , this is not the case even for high temperature phase boundaries .",
    "this is because the spin - reversal does not necessarily have to take place during the presence of the field , it may occur long after the withdrawal of the pulse .",
    "in fact , in our case @xmath55 is expected to have also a @xmath1 dependence .",
    "this can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "1 , where the relaxation rate , after the withdrawal of the field , is strongly dependent on the pulse width ( @xmath1 ) .    from the linearized limit of the mean field equation ( 3 ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath56 for @xmath57 and very close to @xmath18 , so that linearization of ( 3 ) is possible .",
    "since there is no fluctuation in the mean field limit , there can not be any spin reversal if the magnetization remains positive at the time of withdrawal of the pulse .",
    "demanding that the magnetization should at least be zero at the time of withdrawal of the field for an eventual spin reversal , we find the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the phase boundary : @xmath58 for temperatures close to @xmath59 , equation ( 6 ) can be approximated as @xmath60 which indeed compares fairly well with the mean field phase boundaries ( cf .",
    "6 ) in the region long before saturation .",
    "the detailed study of the nature of the domain growth in this case of pulsed fields and their statistics are in the process , and shall be published elsewhere .",
