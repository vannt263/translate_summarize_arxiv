    "single particle spectra of identified hadrons in high energy elementary collisions have attracted physicists for many decades due to their fundamental nature and simplicity .",
    "particle production , in general , can be categorized into two different regimes depending on the transverse momentum of the hadrons .",
    "one is soft multiparticle production , dominant at low transverse momentum ( @xmath13 gev/@xmath14 ) , which corresponds to the @xmath15 fm scale of the nucleon radius described by constituent quarks .",
    "another regime is hard - scattering particle production , evident at high transverse momentum ( @xmath16 gev/@xmath14 ) due to the hard scattering of point - like current quarks , which corresponds to a very short distance scale @xmath17 fm  @xcite and contributes less than a few percent of the cross section for @xmath18  200  gev .",
    "these two different regimes of particle production in @xmath4 collisions indicate that `` elementary '' @xmath4 collisions are actually rather complicated processes .",
    "it is interesting to know where the `` soft - hard transition '' happens , and its beam energy and particle species dependences , since they have not yet been fully understood .    in soft particle production",
    ", cosmic ray physicists observed in the 1950s that the average transverse momentum of secondary particles is limited to @xmath190.5 gev/@xmath14 , independent of the primary energy  @xcite .",
    "cocconi , koester and perkins  @xcite then proposed the prescient empirical formula for the transverse momentum spectrum of meson production : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transverse momentum in gev/@xmath14 and @xmath220.333 gev/@xmath14 .",
    "the observation by orear  @xcite that large angle @xmath4 elastic scattering measurements at ags energies ( 10 to 30 gev in incident energy ) `` can be fit by a single exponential in transverse momentum , and that this exponential is the very same exponential that describes the transverse momentum distribution of pions produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions '' , led to the interpretation  @xcite that particle production is `` statistical '' with eq .",
    "[ eq : ckp ] as a thermal boltzmann spectrum , with 1/6=0.167 gev/@xmath14 representing the `` temperature '' @xmath23 at which the mesons or protons are emitted  @xcite .",
    "it was natural in a thermal scenario  @xcite to represent the invariant cross section as a function of the rapidity ( @xmath24 ) and the transverse mass ( @xmath25 ) with a universal temperature parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this description explained well the observed successively increasing @xmath26 of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath2 , @xmath29 with increasing rest mass  @xcite , and had the added advantage of explaining , by the simple factor @xmath30 12% , the low value of @xmath1910% observed for the @xmath31 ratio at low @xmath21 at isr energies ( @xmath322060 gev )  @xcite .    in 1964 , the constituent quark model with su(3 ) symmetry was introduced to explain the hadron flavor spectrum and the static properties of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "later on , a dynamical model was developed to calculate the flavor dependence of identified hadrons in soft multi - particle production  @xcite , together with the inclusive reaction formalism  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies on the particle production mechanism showed that there was much to be learned by simply measuring a single particle spectrum , and it brought the study of identified inclusive single particle production into the mainstream of @xmath4 physics .",
    "one of the controversial issues in understanding soft multi - particle production in the 1950 s was whether more than one meson could be produced in a single nucleon - nucleon collision ( `` multiple production '' ) , or whether the multiple meson production observed in nucleon - nucleus ( @xmath33 ) interactions was the result of several successive nucleon - nucleon collisions with each collision producing only a single meson ( `` plural production '' )  @xcite .",
    "the issue was decided when multiple meson production was first observed in 1954 at the brookhaven cosmotron in collisions between neutrons with energies up to 2.2 gev and protons in a hydrogen filled cloud chamber  @xcite .",
    "then the observation of multi - particle production occurring not only in nucleon - nucleus ( @xmath33 ) but also in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) collisions motivated fermi and landau to develop the statistical  @xcite and hydrodynamical  @xcite approach to multi - particle production .",
    "belenkij and landau observed that although the statistical model of fermi is sufficient to describe the particle numbers in terms of only a temperature and a chemical potential , this model has to be extended to hydrodynamics , when particle spectra are considered .",
    "they also noted that the domain of the applicability of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics coincides with the domain of the applicability of thermodynamical models in high energy @xmath4 collisions  @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , understanding of the particle production by hard scattering partons has been advanced by the appearance of a rich body of data in @xmath4 collisions at the cern - isr  @xcite in the 1970s , followed by measurements at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at = 200  @xcite and 62.4 gev  @xcite over the last decade .",
    "the hard scattering in @xmath4 collisions has been discovered by the observation of an unexpectedly large yield of particles with large transverse momentum and the phenomena of dijets at isr  @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that hard scattering process occurs between the quarks and gluons constituents ( or partons ) inside the nucleons .",
    "this scattering process can be described by the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) because the strong coupling constant @xmath34 of qcd becomes small ( asymptotically free ) for large momentum transfer ( @xmath35 ) parton - parton scatterings .",
    "after the initial high @xmath35 parton - parton scatterings , these partons fragment into the high @xmath21 hadrons or jets .",
    "in fact , at rhic energies , single particle spectra of high @xmath21 hadrons are well described by pqcd  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , which is also inspired by pqcd , is known to be a good scaling variable of the particle production at high @xmath21 at both isr  @xcite and rhic  @xcite energies , so that @xmath36 scaling can be used to distinguish between the soft and hard particle productions .",
    "another important point of measurements in @xmath4 collisions is as a baseline for the heavy ion ( a@xmath38a ) data .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath39 , for example , uses @xmath21 spectra in @xmath4 collisions as a denominator , and those in a@xmath38a collisions ( with the appropriate scaling of number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ) as a numerator .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 spectra in @xmath4 provide a reference of bulk properties of a@xmath38a collisions , such as the inverse slope parameter @xmath6 , mean transverse momentum @xmath26 , and yield per unit rapidity @xmath8 .",
    "these data in @xmath4 collisions can be treated as baseline values for the smallest a@xmath38a collisions .    in this paper , we present measurements of identified charged hadron @xmath21 spectra for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath40 at midrapidity in @xmath4 collisions at  =  200 and 62.4 gev from the phenix experiment .",
    "first , we compare the results of particle spectra at 200 gev with those at 62.4 gev as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the rest mass ) .",
    "second , the extracted values from @xmath21 spectra , i.e. @xmath6 , @xmath26 , and @xmath8 , are compared between the two beam energies . for the systematic study of particle production as a function of the data",
    "are further compared to measurements in @xmath4 and @xmath9 collisions at the cern - isr and fnal - tevatron colliders .",
    "from these measurements , we discuss the following key issues :    * hard scattering particle production *  the data are compared with the results of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations .",
    "* transition from soft to hard physics *  since the @xmath21 regions presented in this paper can cover the region where the soft - hard transition occurs , the scaling properties in @xmath41 and @xmath36 with their beam energy and particle species dependences are shown .    *",
    "comparisons with heavy - ion data as a baseline measurement *  some of the data in @xmath4 are compared with the existing data in au@xmath38au  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : setup ] describes the phenix detector as it was used in this measurement .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] discusses the analysis details , including data sets , event selection , track selection , particle identification , corrections applied to the data , and systematic uncertainties .",
