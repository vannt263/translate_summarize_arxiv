    "it is widely recognized that stellar bars , either spontaneously or tidally induced , redistribute mass and angular momentum and thereby drive the dynamical and secular evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy 1982 ; shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ; pfenniger & norman 1990 ; friedli & benz 1993 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . in the local universe , one - third of local spiral galaxies host optically visible strong bars ( e.g. , eskridge et al .",

    ") , velocity fields ( e.g. , regan , vogel , & teuben 1997 ) , and starbursts ( e.g. , hunt & malkan 1999 ; jogee , scoville , & kenney 2004a ) , suggests that bars strongly influence their host galaxies .",
    "however , the most fundamental issues have yet to be resolved . when and how did bars form ?",
    "are bars a recent phenomenon or were they abundant at early cosmic epochs ? are bars long - lived or do they recurrently dissolve and re - form over a hubble time ? how do stellar bars fit within the hierarchical clustering framework of galaxy evolution and relate to the underlying disk evolution ?",
    "the evolution of a bar over a hubble time depends on the host galaxy structure , the dark matter ( dm ) halo , and the environment .",
    "numerical simulations of this complex process make widely different predictions ( e.g. , friedli & benz 1993 ; shlosman & noguchi 1993 ; el - zant & shlosman 2002 ; athanassoula 2002 ; bournaud & combes 2002 ; shen & sellwood 2004 ) , while the handful of observational results on bars at intermediate redshifts are conflicting . on the basis of 46 moderately inclined galaxies",

    "s03 point out that their observed bar fraction of @xmath15% for large ( 12 kpc ) bars at @xmath13 0.7 is at least comparable to the local fraction of similarly large bars . from a study based on @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) f814w images of 186 galaxies over a @xmath22 area in the tadpole field , elmegreen , elmegreen , & hirst ( 2004 , hereafter e04 ) report a constant optical bar fraction of @xmath120%40% at @xmath12  01.1 .",
    "this study is limited by the large ( 0.10.4 ) errors of the photometric redshifts ( bentez et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the small sample size precludes absolute magnitude completeness cuts .",
    "furthermore , with only a single acs filter , the rest - frame bandpass of the observations shifts by more than a factor of 2 over @xmath12  01.1 .    in this letter ( see also jogee et al .",
    "2004b ) , we present the first results of an extensive study of bars at @xmath0  @xmath1  0.21.0 , based on two - band acs images covering @xmath23 ( @xmath125% ) of the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems ) survey .",
    "the area and the sample size of 1590 galaxies provide at least an order of magnitude better number statistics than earlier studies .",
    "we quantitatively identify bars using ellipse fits and minimize the effects of bandpass shifts by using both f850lp and f606w images ( @xmath15 2.2 ) . using highly accurate redshifts ( @xmath15 2.1 ) , we compare the bar fractions in two redshift slices after applying completeness criteria .",
    "we show that the optical fraction of strong ( ellipticities @xmath9  0.4 ) bars is remarkably constant ( @xmath1 30% ) from the present - day out to look - back times ( @xmath24 ) of 26 gyr ( @xmath12  0.20.7 ) and @xmath25 = 70  km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath26 .",

    "we analyze only @xmath125% of the gems field as this area ( @xmath23 ) is already 30 times that of the hdf and yields good number statistics and robust results on the bar fraction ( @xmath15 3 ) .",

    "table 1 illustrates the two methods that we use for assessing bar properties in two redshift slices at 0.25  @xmath34  0.70 and 0.7  @xmath34  1.0 .",
    "the first method ( referred to as method i in table 1 ) is to identify bars in the reddest filter ( f850lp ) at all @xmath0 in order to minimize extinction and better trace old stars .",
    "however , with this method , the rest - frame bandpass shifts significantly , from @xmath35 to @xmath36 across the redshift range 0.21.0 .",
    "the second complementary method is to trace bars in both f606w and f850lp images such that the rest - frame band remains relatively constant , between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , out to @xmath12  1.0 .",
    "we identify bars and other galactic components in f606w and f850lp images via the widely used ( e.g. , wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ; jogee et al .  1999 , 2002 ; knapen et al .",
    "2000 ) procedure of fitting ellipses using the standard iraf `` ellipse '' routine .",
    "we developed a wrapper that automatically runs `` ellipse '' for a range of different initial parameters , performing up to 200 fits per galaxy .",
    "we successfully fitted ellipses to 90% of the 1590 galaxies , while the 10% failure cases included mostly very disturbed systems where no centering could be performed and some extended low surface brightness systems .",
    "for all fitted galaxies , we inspected the image ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the fitted ellipses overlaid on the images ( fig .",
    "1b ) , and the radial profiles ( fig .",
    "1c ) of intensity , ellipticity ( @xmath38 ) , and position angle ( p.a . ) in order to confirm that the best fit is reliable .",
    "this inspection was aided by a visualization tool that we developed .",
    "we identify a bar as such if the fitted ellipses and radial profiles show the following characteristic bar signature ( e.g , wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ) illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "( i )  the ellipticity ( @xmath38 ) must rise to a _",
    "global maximum @xmath39 , which we require to be above 0.25 , as well as above that of the outer disk , while the p.a . has a plateau ( within @xmath11  20@xmath40 ) along the bar .",
    "( ii )  beyond the bar end , as the bar - to - disk transition occurs , @xmath38 must drop by @xmath41  0.1 , while the p.a .",
    "usually changes by @xmath42 @xmath43 . from the profiles , we identify @xmath38 , p.a . , and semi major axes @xmath10 of both the bar and the outer disk .",
    "we quantify the bar strength using @xmath39 , which correlates locally with other measures of bar strength , such as the gravitational bar torque ( laurikainen , salo , & rautiainen 2002 ) .",
    "_    the sample of 1430 galaxies with successful ellipse fits includes galaxies of different morphological types ( disks and spheroids ) , inclinations , and absolute magnitudes .",
    "we apply two cuts at @xmath4  @xmath5  @xmath619.3 and @xmath620.6 .",
    "the first cut gives us a sizeable sample of galaxies with a range of absolute magnitudes ( @xmath619.3 to @xmath623.8 ) similar to that of the ohio state university ( osu ) survey , which is used to define the local bar fraction ( eo2 ) .",
    "however , @xmath44-corrections based on local scd templates ( coleman , wu , & weedman 1980 ) suggest that we are only complete out to @xmath12  0.8 for the first cut .",
    "the second more stringent cut at @xmath620.6 ensures completeness out to @xmath12  1.0 , but it reduces the sample drastically ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in addition , to ensure reliable bar detection , we use the disk inclination @xmath45 from ellipse fits ( @xmath15 2.2 ) to exclude highly inclined ( @xmath46  @xmath3 ) galaxies .",
    "the optical bar fraction @xmath33 is defined as ( @xmath47/@xmath48 ) where @xmath48 is the number of spiral or disk galaxies , and @xmath47 is the number of such systems hosting bars .",
    "we identify spiral / disk galaxies using three independent techniques ( table 1 ) .",
    "we first use the criterion @xmath49  2.5 , where @xmath50 is the index of single - component sersic models fitted to gems galaxies ( b. hussler et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) with the galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) package .",
    "our choice of @xmath49  2.5 is dictated by the fact that a study of gems galaxies at @xmath17  0.7 ( bell et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as tests in which we insert artificial galaxies in the gems fields , suggest that a sersic cut of @xmath51 picks up disk - dominated systems .",
    "the second technique uses a cut @xmath52  3.4 , where @xmath53 is the cas ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) concentration index .",
    "third , we use rest - frame @xmath54 color cuts in the range 0.81.2 to broadly separate spiral galaxies from red e / s0s , based on local sed templates and the observed red sequence at @xmath17  0.7 ( bell et al .",
    "the bars that we identify primarily have ellipticities @xmath9  0.4 and semi major axes @xmath10 in the range @xmath55@xmath56 and 1.213 kpc ( fig .",
    "our experiment of artificially redshifting @xmath36-band images of a subset of osu galaxies out to @xmath12  1 shows that it is difficult to unambiguously identify weaker ( @xmath57 0.3 ) bars , and we limit the discussion in this letter to strong ( @xmath9  0.4 ) bars .",
    "table 1 shows the optical bar fraction @xmath33 of such bars in the two redshift slices ( 0.25 @xmath340.70 and 0.7@xmath341.0 ) derived in the reddest filter and in a relatively fixed rest - frame band ( @xmath15 2.2 ) .",
    "results for @xmath4  @xmath5  @xmath619.3 are shown , based on 627 galaxies out of which we identify 258 moderately inclined ( @xmath58  @xmath3 ) spirals that host @xmath180 bars .",
    "the consistency in the six entries attests to the robustness of the results and shows that _ the fraction of optically visible bars remains in the range 23%36% or at @xmath130%  @xmath11  6% in both slices .",
    "incompleteness effects ( @xmath15 2.2 ) do not bias the results since the cut at @xmath620.6 gives similar bar fractions , shown in brackets ( table 1 ) .",
    "the bar fraction is slightly higher in the rest - frame @xmath35 band than @xmath36 band , possibly indicative of dust and star formation masking bars at bluer wavelengths .",
    "our findings of a fairly constant @xmath33 are consistent with e04 and do not show the dramatic decline in @xmath33 reported by a99 .",
    "_    more than 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes @xmath7  @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and many of these smallest bars may have been missed in earlier wfpc2 ( e.g. , a99 ) and nicmos studies that did not benefit from the small ( @xmath59 ) acs pixels , and the resulting narrow psf .",
    "in addition to the wider wfpc2 psf , cosmic variance , low number statistics , and methodology may have led to the lower @xmath33 reported by a99 , but we can not address this issue further here as the coordinates of galaxies in that study have not been published .    how do our results compare to @xmath33 for correspondingly strong bars in the local universe ?",
    "there are as yet no statistics published on @xmath60  0 bars based on a large volume - limited sample such as the sloan digitized sky survey . as the next best alternative",
    ", we turn to the osu sample ( e02 ) . for @xmath61",
    "@xmath3 spirals , we find @xmath33  @xmath1  37% for strong bars classified according to the visual rc3 ` sb ' bar class , and @xmath33  @xmath1  33% for strong bars classified according to @xmath9  0.4 , where @xmath38 is based on ellipse fits to osu @xmath36-band images .",
    "it appears that the optical fraction of strong ( @xmath9  0.4 ) bars remains remarkably similar at @xmath130%37% from the present - day out to look - back times of 26 gyr ( @xmath12  0.20.7 ) and 68 gyr ( @xmath12 0.71.0 ) .",
    "our findings have several implications for disk and bar evolution .",
    "( 1 )  the abundance of strong bars at early times implies that dynamically cold disks that can form large - scale stellar bars are already in place by @xmath17  1 .",
    "they also suggest that highly triaxial , centrally concentrated dm halos , which tend to destabilize the bar ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ) , may not be prevalent in galaxies at @xmath12  01 . ( 3 )  the remarkably similar fraction of strong bars at look - back times of 68 gyr , 26 gyr , and in the present day supports the view that large - scale stellar bars are long - lived ( e.g. , athanassoula 2002 ; shen & sellwood 2004 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .   2004 ) , with a lifetime well above 2 gyr . the alternative option , statistically allowed by the data ,",
    "is that the combined destruction and reformation timescale of bars is on average well below 2 gyr .",
    "however , this is highly implausible because the destruction of a bar leaves behind a dynamically hot disk that can not reform a bar unless it is substantially cooled via processes that take at least several gyr , such as the accretion of large amounts of cold gas .",
    "( 3 )  we note that a similar _ fraction of bars at different epochs does not exclude the possibility that the bar strength ( ellipticity ) and its size can evolve in time because of intrinsic factors and concurrent changes in the surrounding disk , bulge and halo potentials ( e.g. , athanassoula 2002 ; martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 ) .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov tests on the distributions of @xmath38 and @xmath10 for different magnitude cuts yield primarily @xmath62 in the range 0.20.5 , where @xmath62 is the significance level for the null hypothesis that the two data sets are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "such values of @xmath62 hint at evolutionary effects , but a larger sample is needed to draw definite conclusions . while this letter focuses on the optical bar _ fraction , in paper ii , we will invoke the full gems sample of 8300 galaxies to compare bar and host galaxy properties ( e.g. , disk scale lengths , masses , and @xmath63 ratios ) over the last 8 gyr at 1 gyr intervals . s.j .",
