    "@xmath9 is a ten - dimensional vector and @xmath10 is a ten - dimensional majorana - weyl fermion .",
    "one of the important aspects of this model is the dynamical generation of the spacetime and the gauge group . in this model",
    "the eigenvalue distribution represents spacetime geometry . from this point of view , if a four - dimensional eigenvalue distribution has smaller free energy than the other configurations , the spacetime will be compactified to four - dimensions . on the other hand",
    "the stability of @xmath2 coincident d - branes may indicate the dynamical generation of @xmath12 gauge group .",
    "so far , various attempts on this have been made .",
    "several such attempts using branched polymer @xcite , complex phase effect @xcite and especially improved mean - field approximation @xcite were successful . in these studies ,",
    "four - dimensional configurations were found to have smaller free energy .",
    "another interesting approach is to compare the free energies on noncommutative backgrounds . in string theory ,",
    "noncommutative gauge theories on flat or curved backgrounds are realized with constant or nonconstant @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "iib matrix model on flat fuzzy space backgrounds can be mapped to noncommutative super yang - mills theory ( ncsym ) @xcite , and the system can be analyzed by perturbative calculations .",
    "noncommutative gauge theories on curved manifolds have recently been studied extensively by deforming iib matrix model @xcite .",
    "however , flat fuzzy space backgrounds can not be realized as classical solutions at finite @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , in order to see the @xmath14-dependences of the free energies , we must study compact noncommutative spaces .",
    "fuzzy @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 backgrounds have already been studied and @xmath16 has been shown to be stable under certain deformations @xcite .    in this paper , we study the free energies of iib matrix model on fuzzy torus backgrounds . the relation to flat fuzzy space is more transparent in the case of the fuzzy torus than in the case of fuzzy sphere .",
    "we expand the action of iib matrix model around a fuzzy torus background and sum up all 1pi diagrams .",
    "then , we search the minimum of the free energy . especially , we compare @xmath0 and @xmath1 backgrounds . in principle , in order to find the true vacuum , we must calculate free energies on all possible backgrounds and find the minimum . here , however , we consider only fuzzy torus .",
    "although fuzzy torus is not a classical solution , however , as we will show later , fuzzy torus locally looks like flat fuzzy space , which is a classical solution .",
    "therefore , we expect our calculation captures some qualitative feature of flat fuzzy spaces . if the true vacuum is similar to a flat fuzzy space , we may find some informations such as dimensionality of the spacetime on it .",
    "in present study we will see that @xmath0 has smaller free energy than @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that if the true vacuum is four - dimensional , it is not a simple noncommutative space considered here .",
    "although both fuzzy sphere and fuzzy torus break supersymmetry , the breaking effect is soft and the loop corrections to their free energies almost vanish .",
    "this is because their local structures are similar to flat fuzzy spaces . in the case of fuzzy @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , such cancellations",
    "have been confirmed to 2-loop level @xcite . for fuzzy torus",
    "we can see such cancellation at any loop level .",
    "furthermore , in this case the calculations become simpler and we can study larger parameter region .",
    "for example , on @xmath1 , we vary the ratio @xmath18 of the noncommutativity parameters of two tori and their ratio @xmath19 of the matrix size . , @xmath20 was studied @xcite . ]",
    "we can also see the effect of the global topologies on the free energies by comparing the results for fuzzy tori and fuzzy spheres .",
    "on the other hand , fuzzy torus has a few drawbacks .",
    "we embed fuzzy @xmath0 into @xmath21 , while fuzzy @xmath15 can be embedded into @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in ten dimensions we can realize only two- and four - dimensional configurations using fuzzy tori ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , while a six - dimensional configuration can be constructed using fuzzy spheres ( @xmath17 ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath16 has a smaller free energy than @xmath23 . in our case , such comparison is impossible .",
    "we also have subtlety in the perturbative calculation , due to the presence of a few tachyons on fuzzy torus .",
    "we will discuss this problem in detail later .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will construct the fuzzy torus backgrounds and show the correspondence between fuzzy torus and flat fuzzy space . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the free energy up to two loop level analytically , and in section 4 , we compare the free energies numerically . in appendices ,",
    "we show the detail of the calculations .",
    "although we are interested in @xmath1 , we will mostly show the feynman diagrams and calculations of @xmath0 as @xmath1 calculations are very lengthy .",
    "in order to perform a perturbative calculation , we decompose @xmath9 and @xmath10 into a background @xmath24 and the fluctuation @xmath25 around it : @xmath26 adding a gauge fixing and the corresponding ghost term @xmath27 ^ 2+[p_\\mu , b][a^\\mu , c ]    \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to ( [ eq : action ] ) , we obtain the full action @xmath28      +      \\frac{1}{2}{\\bar{\\varphi}}\\gamma^\\mu[a_\\mu,{\\varphi } ]      +      ( { { \\cal p}}_\\mu b)[a^\\mu , c ]    \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\    & &    -\\frac{1}{4g^2}\\ { { \\rm tr}}[a_\\mu , a_\\nu]^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29,\\ f_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv i[p_\\mu , p_\\nu]$ ] and @xmath30 $ ] . if the background is not a classical solution , e.g. fuzzy sphere or fuzzy torus , the @xmath31 term does not vanish .",
    "first , we introduce the @xmath11 clock and shift matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy @xmath35    using them , we construct a 2-dimensional fuzzy torus as follows : @xmath36 here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the noncommutativity parameters , which have the dimension of mass .",
    "their product , @xmath39 , corresponds to the noncommutativity parameter @xmath40 of fuzzy plane .",
    "the relation of this background to fuzzy plane is discussed more precisely in section [ sec : relation_of_torus_to_d_brane ] .",
    "we can expand the fluctuations in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42 and the hermiticity condition is given by @xmath43    we will show that this expansion corresponds to the ordinary fourier expansion in section [ sec : relation_of_torus_to_d_brane ] . using these fourier modes , we can construct the feynman rules , which we summarize in appendix [ sec : feynman_rule ] .",
    "we can similarly construct fuzzy @xmath1 using the tensor products of the fuzzy tori constructed above : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the @xmath47 clock and shift matrices . for simplicity , we set the radii of the two circles in the first @xmath0 to the same value @xmath48 , and similarly in the second @xmath0 to @xmath49 . in the following sections , we first fix the value of @xmath14 , and calculate the free energy as a function of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and",
    "minimize it with respect to them .",
    "we also consider a system of @xmath2-coincident fuzzy tori . to study @xmath2-coincident fuzzy @xmath0 ,",
    "we replace @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 stand for the @xmath11 clock and shift matrices , respectively .",

    "we discuss the relation between the fuzzy torus and flat fuzzy space @xcite .",

    ".    iib matrix model on fuzzy torus can be mapped to ncsym as in the case of flat fuzzy space @xcite .",
    "if we introduce the spacetime coordinates as @xmath73 we have @xmath74 where momenta @xmath75 are defined by @xmath76 .",
    "hence the expansion([eq : fourier ] ) becomes the ordinary fourier expansion in the commutative limit .",
    "we calculate the free energies in this section . we ignore the tachyons and zero modes on the fuzzy torus in our calculations .",
    "the vector- and fermion - kinetic terms on fuzzy torus have tachyons and extra zero - modes besides those coming from the u(1)-part .",
    "( see appendix [ sec : tachyon ] for the detail . )",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether perturbative calculation is possible or not .",
    "however , the number of tachyons remains the same in the large-@xmath14 limit , and their mass squared is of @xmath77 and vanishes in the large-@xmath14 limit .",
    "hence we expect that the tachyons give a relative correction of @xmath78 to the free energy . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath79",
    ", we will see that the leading contributions cancel out due to the supersymmetry , but the terms of @xmath77 do not vanish .",
    "they are expected to be larger than the effect of the tachyons , and we can take the large-@xmath14 limit without paying much attention to the tachyons .",
    "we start with the tree - level free energy .",

    "it is @xmath84 and can be neglected compared with the tree - level and 2-loop level contributions . in the case of @xmath0 , truncation at",
    "some order of @xmath85 is not a good approximation because of infrared divergence .    instead",
    ", we can numerically evaluate the 1-loop free energy without expanding in @xmath85 .",
    "we calculate all the eigenvalues of the kinetic terms , and sum up their logarithms .",
    "we find that the 1-loop free energy on @xmath0 background is proportional to @xmath86 and hence negligible compared to the tree level and 2-loop contributions .",
    "next we evaluate the 2-loop free energy on the fuzzy @xmath1 .",
    "since it is difficult to obtain analytic forms of the vector and fermion propagators , we expand them in powers of @xmath85 as shown in appendix [ sec : propagators ] , and calculate the free energy order by order in @xmath85 .",
    "a naive power counting shows that each power of @xmath85 is associated with @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , if there is no infrared divergence .",
    "in fact , this expansion is good on the @xmath1 background , while it is not on the @xmath0 background .",
    "we discuss the validity of this expansion in appendix [ sec : f - expansion ] . here",
    "we show the result for the @xmath1 background .",

    "the contributions from the other diagrams ( fig.1 ( a),(b),(c ) ) also can be written as @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "but the expressions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 become much more complicated , because both vector and fermion propagators contain @xmath110 corrections . summing up all of the diagrams , we find that the leading behavior of the @xmath96 contribution can be expressed as @xmath111 the function @xmath112 is dimensionless and has a symmetry under the exchange of two tori @xmath113      the total free energy on the fuzzy @xmath1 background can be written as @xmath114 where we have neglected subleading terms in @xmath14 .",

    "we have exactly the same situation here .",
    "these results show that although the fuzzy @xmath1 is favourable in some directions , it is unstable under the variation of @xmath19 . because the limit @xmath145 corresponds to the fuzzy @xmath0 ,",
    "we conclude that the fuzzy @xmath0 is more favourable than the fuzzy @xmath1 .",
    "since our observations along @xmath142 is completely analogous to that of @xcite , it is plausible that the fuzzy @xmath16 also has the same kind of instability . a similar phenomenon is observed in a 6 dimensional bosonic matrix model with chern simons term , where @xmath15 is indeed shown to be more favourable than @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "we can compare the free energy of the fuzzy @xmath1 and the fuzzy @xmath16 . at @xmath139 ,",
    "the free energy of @xmath1 is @xmath147 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the free energy of @xmath16 with the same matrix size and noncommutativity is @xmath148 .",

    "we found that it has the minimum at @xmath150 and is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "however , because the @xmath85 expansion is not good in this background , this result is not reliable . the free energy on the @xmath15 background is calculated in @xcite .",
    "in this case , the tree - level action dominates and the free energy is @xmath103 at @xmath151 .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the free energies of iib matrix model on the fuzzy @xmath1 backgrounds up to 2-loop level .",
    "the free energy on @xmath1 is a function of the ratio @xmath18 of the noncommutativity and @xmath19 of the matrix size . at @xmath139 ,",
    "the free energy takes minimum when @xmath18 is varied , but maximum when @xmath19 is varied .",
    "this indicates that @xmath0 is more stable than @xmath1 .",
    "it is plausible that @xmath16 has the same sort of instability .",
    "if so , a four - dimensional vacuum might not be realized as a direct product of two noncommutative surfaces .",
    "commutative backgrounds seem to be more plausible .",
    "another possibility is that new terms like myers term arise dynamically ( for example via large-@xmath14 rg ) and stabilize noncommutative spaces .",
    "we also have compared the free energies of @xmath16 and @xmath1 , and found that the latter is about 10 times as large as the former .",
    "it implies that iib matrix model favors configurations with higher symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the free energy of the system of @xmath2-coincident fuzzy @xmath1 , and found that the @xmath152 system has the smallest free energy . in terms of ncsym , this means that u(1 ) gauge group is favored .",
    "this result is the same as that of the fuzzy sphere in iib matrix model @xcite and in bosonic matrix models with chern simons term @xcite .",

    "the only difference from fuzzy plane is that the momentum @xmath185 is replaced with @xmath186 .",
    "+ the @xmath186 s satisfy the following set of equations : @xmath187 which is an analogue of @xmath188 . using this",
    ", we can express the free energy only by @xmath189 s .",
    "since the momentum space is completely periodic in the fuzzy torus background , we can shift the integration variables without any obstruction , and find that the free energy is zero at this level .",
    "if we evaluate the free energy without using the approximations , there appear @xmath77-corrections .",
    "in this section , we discuss the validity of the @xmath85-expansion .",
    "first we consider the case of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath85 s are expressed in the momentum basis such as @xmath190 and @xmath166 is expressed as @xmath191 hence , in the generic region , where @xmath192 etc , one @xmath193-insertion amounts to multiplying @xmath194 .    however ,",
    "if the arguments in @xmath195 are small , the situation changes .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath196 and consider the region where all arguments in @xmath195 are of @xmath197 , then @xmath198 .",
    "this shows that in the ir region convergence of the @xmath85-expansion becomes worse . in the case",
    "that @xmath196 , the free energy does not have ir divergence .",
    "therefore the generic region dominates , and the convergence of this expansion is good .",
    "indeed , from the numerical calculations of the 2-loop free energy , we can see that one insertion of @xmath193 decreases the power of @xmath14 by @xmath199 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of @xmath0 background , the free energy has ir divergence . therefore ir region dominates and the insertion of @xmath193 does not decrease the power of @xmath14 . in this case",
    "@xmath85-expansion is not reliable .",
    "on fuzzy torus , there exist zero and tachyonic modes , which we list below .",
    "to be concrete we discuss the @xmath0-case here .",
    "we use the following 4-dimensional gamma matrices : @xmath200 where @xmath201 are the pauli matrices and @xmath202 . + for the left - handed spinor , the dirac operator is given by @xmath203   & l_1[u^{-1},\\ \\cdot\\ ] \\\\",
    "l_1[u,\\ \\cdot\\ ]   & -l_2[v^{-1},\\ \\cdot\\ ]      \\end{array }    \\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , there are two left - handed zero modes , @xmath204    similarly for the right - handed spinors we have two zero modes given by @xmath205 these zero - modes are not doublers , because their momenta become zero in the large-@xmath14 limit .",
    "although the numbers of zero and tachyonic modes depend on @xmath14 , they become constant when @xmath14 is sufficiently large . if the ratio @xmath206 , there are 4 zero modes and 5 tachyons . on the other hand , if @xmath207 , there are no zero modes and 7 tachyons .",
    "a direct calculation shows that if @xmath135 , @xmath208 is an eigenstate with the smallest eigenvalue @xmath209 .",
    "this mode corresponds to the deformation of the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "here we evaluate the @xmath89 and @xmath96 contributions to the 2-loop free energy on the fuzzy @xmath1 .",
    "for brevity of notation , we introduce the following notations @xmath210 where @xmath211 .",
    "we further introduce the abbreviation @xmath212 , which is the analogue of the inner product of momenta .",
    "we have four kinds of 1pi 2-loop vacuum diagrams ( fig [ fig:2loop_diagrams ] ) .",
    "we list the contributions from each diagram : +   + * ( a ) diagram with two fermion - fermion - boson vertices @xmath168 * @xmath213 here we have used @xmath214 .",
    "+   + * ( b ) diagram with two ghost - ghost - vector vertices @xmath171 * + the exact result is given by @xmath215 shifting @xmath216 s and introducing approximations , @xmath217 and so on , we obtain @xmath218 + * ( c ) diagram with two boson - boson - vector vertices @xmath174 * + the exact result is given by @xmath219 again by shifting @xmath220 and using the approximations ( [ simeq : approximation ] ) , we can rewrite it as @xmath221 + * ( d ) diagram with two 4-boson vertex @xmath176 * @xmath222    summing up ( a)@xmath94(d ) , we find that the 2-loop vacuum diagrams almost cancel . actually , if we use the approximate values ( [ eq:2loop_v3g_approximated ] ) and ( [ eq:2loop_v3b_approximated ] ) , we have @xmath223        the calculation of the @xmath96 contribution is very tedious . here",
    "we show only the simplest case , that is , the planar part of fig.[fig:2loop_diagrams ] ( b ) : @xmath224 here , @xmath225 , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 vary from @xmath103 to @xmath104",
