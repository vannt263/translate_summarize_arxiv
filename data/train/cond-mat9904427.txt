    "mentioned above , however , no spin canting has been observed .",
    "@xcite    double - layered manganites with @xmath17 ( 327-system ) offer an interesting opportunity to study the interplay of the spin , the orbital and the crystal structure in the above - mentioned issues of dimensionality and spin canting . with increasing @xmath18 , the spin ordering within one double - layer changes from the ferromagnetic one ( spin @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) to the spin @xmath7 ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "@xcite the @xmath74-spin @xmath7 state ( shaded in fig . [ fig : f4](a ) ) is surrounded by the discontious `` orbital spin - flop '' transition .",
    "this is because the `` orbital magnetic field '' @xmath99 is applied not perpendicularly but anti - parallel to the @xmath11-direction .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that the spin canting occurs between the @xmath74-spin @xmath7 and spin @xmath19 with _ different _ orbital structures , e.g. , the arrow ( a ) in fig .",

    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "we assume that the spin polarization is perfect , i.e. , all the electron spins are aligned along the ordered direction .",

    "the density of states is taken to be a constant @xmath109 for each layer .",

    "@xcite according to this scenario , the temperature dependence of the spin canting mentioned above is also explained by the change in the hybridization of @xmath24 @xcite which is brought about by the temperature - depenedent lattice elongation .",
    "this scenario , however , results in the decrease of the inter - layer hopping as @xmath18 ( @xmath26 ) increases , being opposite to our scenario , where little change in the orbital ordering and the increase of the inter - layer hopping @xmath145 during the spin transition are predicted .",
    "main distinction between these two scenarios is whether such a large change in the hybridization of @xmath24 occurs during the spin transition or not . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , however , the spin transition should be of the first order without canting if it is accompanied with the large change in the orbital .",

    "though , even in this case , the `` orbital magnetic field '' brings about a little change in the hybridization of @xmath24 via the change of the weight mentioned before , @xmath147 , it is a minor correction comparing with the sensitively changing bond - length dependence , @xmath148 .    for the spin canting , @xmath149 , and hence the planer orbital during the spin transition turned out to be essential .",
    "in 113-system , the spin @xmath19 phase neighboring the metallic spin @xmath7 has the quasi - three - dimensional orbital ordering for the realistic parameters in the mean field theory .",
