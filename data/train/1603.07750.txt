    "the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of bhs in the ads space has gained much more attention in recent years due to the famous work of hawking and page@xcite .",

    "this thermodynamic properties for rn - ads bh has been studied in detail by kubizk - mann@xcite by considering the extended phase - space analysis .",
    "they beutifully described the analogy between van der waals fluid - gas system and charged ads bh .",
    "they have written the equation of state and determined the critical constants in comparison with the liquid system .",
    "critical constants and critical exponents were calculated and shown to coincide with those of the liquid - gas sytems .",
