    "<S> an all - superconducting bijunction consists of a central superconductor contacted to two lateral superconductors , such that non - local crossed andreev reflection is operating . </S>",
    "<S> then new correlated transport channels for the cooper pairs appear in addition to those of separated conventional josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we study this system in a configuration where the superconductors are connected through gate - controllable quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> multipair phase - coherent resonances and phase - dependent multiple andreev reflections are both obtained when the voltages of the lateral superconductors are commensurate , and they add to the usual local dissipative transport due to quasiparticles . the two - pair resonance ( quartets ) as well as some other higher order multipair resonances are @xmath0-shifted at low voltage . </S>",
    "<S> dot control can be used to dramatically enhance the multipair current when the voltages are resonant with the dot levels . </S>"
