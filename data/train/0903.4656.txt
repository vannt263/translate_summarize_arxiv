    "path integral methods provide a powerful tool to investigate the properties of nonlinear dynamical systems with retarded interactions .",
    "hamiltonian models with non local electron - phonon couplings , used in polymer science @xcite , have been studied by such methods . in this paper",
    "the path integral approach @xcite is applied to analyse the temperature driven dna denaturation which occurs when the double stranded molecule separates into two coils while , at lower @xmath1 , only localized openings exist @xcite .",
    "modelling of dna melting has been motivated since long by the need to understand the transcription mechanism in which the double helix opens locally to allow a reading of the genetic code . in this regard , the poland - scheraga model @xcite has been path - breaking and still makes the base of several investigations @xcite . despite extensive analytical and numerical work",
    "@xcite , establishing character and nature of the melting phase transition , whether first or second order , remains a challenging task @xcite .",
    "a significant advance towards a comprehension of the dna dynamics was made after peyrard and bishop ( pb ) introduced a 1d hamiltonian model @xcite which recognized the role of nonlinearities in the molecule @xcite and reduced its great complexity to two essential interactions : _",
    "i ) _ a nonlinear coupling between the two bases in a pair connected by hydrogen bonds , _ ii ) _ a _ harmonic _ stacking potential between adjacent bases along the strand .",
    "while solutions based on the transfer integral method @xcite predicted a smooth denaturation transition both for homogeneous and heterogeneous dna @xcite , extensions of the pb model @xcite which include _ anharmonic _ stacking interactions showed that the denaturation can be sharp , occurs at lower @xmath1 than in the harmonic case and it is indeed a thermodynamic transition @xcite .",
    "the latter statement does not contraddict general theorems on the impossibility of phase transitions in 1d systems @xcite as the pb hamiltonian contains an on site potential depending on unbounded transverse stretchings .",
    "moreover , in the thermodynamic limit , the energy of a domain wall between two states of the molecule is infinite and an ordered state is then possible @xcite .",
    "as the anharmonic pb model is assumed as fundamental tool , it is understood that the emphasis of the present investigation is purely on modelling the unbinding of the two strands versus temperature .",
    "this is done by capturing the essentials of the interactions consistently with the spirit of the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the pb hamiltonian model is outlined in section ii focussing on those properties which make reliable to attack the problem by path integral techniques .",
    "section iii describes the method while the results concerning the character of the denaturation transition are discussed in section iv .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "to begin , i consider a fragment of homogeneous dna whose strands are represented by a set of point masses corresponding to the nucleotides .",
    "the hamiltonian @xcite for a chain of n base pairs ( _ bps _ ) with mass @xmath2 , reads :    @xmath3 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & v_s(y_n , y_{n-1})=\\ , { k \\over 2 } g(y_n , y_{n-1})(y_n - y_{n-1})^2 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & g(y_n , y_{n-1})=\\,1 + \\rho \\exp\\bigl[-\\alpha(y_n + y_{n-1})\\bigr]\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & v_m(y_n ) = \\ , d \\bigl(\\exp(-a y_n ) - 1 \\bigr)^2 \\ , , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , the transverse stretching for the _ n- bp _ , measures the relative pair separation from the ground state position and continuously grows from @xmath5 ( closed _ bp _ ) to @xmath6 ( open _ bp _ after denaturation occurs ) .",
    "as the hydrogen bond can be compressed with respect to the equilibrium , @xmath4 takes also negative values with a lower cutoff accounting for the repulsive interaction of the phosphate groups .",
    "the longitudinal displacements are neglected in the model as their amplitudes are much smaller than the transverse stretchings @xcite . @xmath7 and @xmath8 , setting depth and width of the morse potential @xmath9 , are site independent for _ homopolymer dna_. in the stacking potential @xmath10 , the factor @xmath11 depends on the sum of the stretchings of two adjacent bases .",
    "@xmath12 with @xmath13 being the harmonic phonon frequency . for @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , the statistical mechanics can be worked out exactly through the transfer operator method @xcite which , in continuum approximation and strong @xmath15 limit , defines a pseudo - schrdinger equation for a particle in a morse potential @xcite .",
    "the latter has a discrete spectrum with localized eigenfunctions at @xmath16 being    @xmath17    the temperature at which the lowest eigenvalue vanishes and even the ground state merges into the continuum .",
    "@xmath18 is the boltzmann constant . for @xmath19 only delocalized states exist .",
    "thus , even the simplest harmonic stacking model shows that a transition occurs and @xmath20 is identified as the temperature at which the strands separate . taking typical values for dna parametrization @xcite such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "one gets @xmath24 .",
    "anharmonicity ( @xmath25 ) has a special meaning in dna stacking . while the analytical form of @xmath11 may not be unique in order to reproduce the denaturation transition @xcite",
    ", the key property of the stacking potential is the following : whenever either one of the _ bps _ is stretched over a distance larger than @xmath26 , the hydrogen bond breaks and the electronic distribution around the two pair mates is modified .",
    "accordingly , the stacking coupling ( along each strand ) between neighboring bases in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) drops from @xmath27 to @xmath15 .",
    "then , also the next _ bp _ tends to open as both bases are less closely packed along their respective strands .",
    "here is the _ cooperative _ character which underlines the formation of a region with open _ bps _ , a bubble whose size increases with @xmath1 . in heterogeneous dna , also",
    "the length of the sequence may affect the probability to open a bubble which is quantified in polymer network theories by the _ cooperativity parameter @xmath28 _ : for sequences of intermediate length ( up to @xmath29 ) , a small @xmath28 ( @xmath30 ) generally suppresses bubble formation while large portions of the helix unbind close to the melting making the transition highly cooperative @xcite . for long sequences ,",
    "@xmath28 is larger and small bubbles may form already below the transition which accordingly is expected to be less cooperative .    when the stacking decreases the vibrational mode between the two bases softens thus reducing its contribution to the free energy .",
    "then , as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , the denaturation onset is signalled by a phonon mode softening which , in general @xcite , may point to the occurence of a phase transition .",
    "for these reasons , anharmonic stacking models well account for cooperativity effects in the formation of open domains .",
    "being the latter a collective phenomenon , computational methods have to include hundreds of base pairs in order to study the dynamics even of a molecule fragment and this requires considerable computational power .",
    "these facts suggest that models at intermediate scales are important and motivate the idea to investigate the dna denaturation by path integral techniques .",
    "the path integral formalism defines the time ( @xmath31 ) evolution amplitude between two points , say `` a '' and `` b '' , as a sum over _ all _ histories along which a system can evolve in going from `` a '' to `` b '' .",
    "each history is weighed by a phase factor , the exponential of the action associated to a given path @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the thermal properties of the system can be derived by weighing the contributions by the particle paths @xmath32 running along the imaginary time axis @xmath33 , after an analytic continuation is performed : @xmath34 .",

    "* a ) * @xmath74 suffices to make the calculation convergent in the sense that @xmath61 would not change by taking @xmath75 .",
    "this result can be understood as follows : the inclusion of higher fourier components leads to larger ( absolute ) values for the path amplitudes but @xmath66 _ takes care of suppressing paths that leave the reasonable boundaries_. while there is no reason to include paths whose fate is that of being suppressed , a proper ensemble of paths can be built by taking a sufficiently high number of integration points for the first fourier component in a sufficiently broad range .",
    "this ensures that the programme samples a large portion of the phase space in which all the relevant path amplitudes are accounted for .",
    "incidentally , the ( @xmath74)-strategy also permits to save a great amount of computing time .    *",

    "the latter grows exponentially thus yielding a large action which , in turn , makes a vanishing contribution to @xmath61 .",

    "certainly , if the denaturation occurs , a significant fraction of _ bps _ is expected to be @xmath97 .",

    "the method works self - consistently selecting the minimum number of paths required ( at any @xmath1 ) to pursue the goal , that is the growing entropy constraint .",
    "there is no need to add further paths to the partition function once such goal is achieved : i feel that a _ minimum effort principle _ should hold .",
    "instead , the system physical properties may depend on the initial ensemble size and care has been taken to unravel this issue .",
    "thus , the partition function and its derivatives have been computed by varying the boundary condition but no significant variation in the physical behavior has been observed .",
    "it is understood that the initial size should be large enough to allow for the appearance of cooperative effects .",
    "remarkably , the ensemble size strongly grows around and above the denaturation temperature .",
    "the denaturation of the complementary strands always shows up as a smooth crossover whose location along the @xmath1-axis may depend on the stiffness of the stacking interaction .",
    "focussing on the system with moderate anharmonic stacking , it has been found that : _",
    "i ) _ the entropy grows continuosly versus @xmath1 , _ ii ) _ the specific heat displays a peak precisely at the same temperature for which the path ensemble size sharply grows .",
    "these results suggest that the denaturation in homogeneous dna is a highly cooperative phenomenon with the hallmarks of a second order phase transition .",
    "consistently , the fraction of paths sampling the plateau of the morse potential grows continuosly also around the denaturation temperature .",
    "no step - like increase has been observed in the paths fractions which describe the unbinding of the base pairs .",
    "eventually , i wish to emphasize that the thermodynamical constraint applied on the system does not force _ a priori _ the entropy to grow continuosly . while the system autonomously selects at any @xmath1 the total number of paths to fulfill such constraint ,",
    "both a step discontinuity and a continuous behavior may in principle appear .",
    "the obtained plots are therefore not an artifact of the method .    after testing the feasibility of the path integral approach to a large size system as homogeneous dna",
    ", i feel that the presented formalism may be further improved / extended to account for bubble formations in heterogeneous models with inhomogeneous sequences .",
