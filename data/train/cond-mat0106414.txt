    "in a recent paper [ 1 ] , felderhof made an attempt to revise the conventional hydrodynamic equations for ferrofluids .",
    "he proposed some modification in the equation of ferrofluid magnetization .",
    "a complete set of ferrohydrodynamic equations was worded for the first time in our paper [ 2 ] almost 30 years ago . in the comment",
    ", we will consider the object of felderhof s criticism , analyze his proposition , and explain why is it wrong .",
    "the main peculiarity of ferrofluids is a specific relation between the magnetic and rotational degrees of freedom of suspended magnetic grains of which the fluids are composed .",
    "therefore the concept of _ internal rotation _ first applied to ferrofluids in [ 2 ] has proved to be very fruitful .",
    "the model [ 2 ] takes into account that the volume density of the angular momentum of ferrofluids consists of both the visible ( `` orbital '' ) and the internal (  spin \" ) parts .",
    "the former , @xmath0 , is associated with the translational motion of magnetic grains and molecules of the solvent .",
    "the latter , @xmath1 , is caused by the rotation of the grains themselves and should be treated as an independent variable along with the fluid velocity @xmath2 , density @xmath3 , and pressure @xmath4 . however , an appropriate thermodynamic coordinate is the difference @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the local angular velocity of the fluid and @xmath7 means the volume density of the particles moment of inertia . for a suspension of spherical particles @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume fraction of the dispersed phase , @xmath10 the particles material density , and @xmath11 the mean particle diameter . in this case",
    "it is convenient to set @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the macroscopic ( i.e. , averaged over physically small volume ) angular velocity of the particles .",
    "any deviation of @xmath13 from @xmath14 gives rise to dissipation processes due to redistribution of angular momentum between @xmath15 and @xmath1 forms .",
    "( the angular momentum conservation law refers , sure , to the total angular momentum @xmath16 ) .",
    "these processes contribute the stress tensor @xmath17 .",
    "for an ordinary ( nonmagnetic ) suspension the tensor has been derived by the methods of irreversible thermodynamics in [ 3 ] : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 stands for antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "apart from the viscosity @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) contains once more kinetic coefficient : the spin relaxation time @xmath22 . for @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "this formula gives @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the difference @xmath26 instantly decays whereupon the hydrodynamic description is reduced to the common set of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "ferrofluids , however , give us an opportunity to maintain this difference by an extraneous magnetic torque which acts directly upon the particles rotation : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the magnetic field within the fluid and @xmath29 is the ferrofluid magnetization . at the _ equilibrium _ in a stationary field , @xmath29 is described well by the langevin formula @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic moment of a single particle and @xmath32 the number density of the particles . eliminating the last term in ( 1 ) with the aid of the torque balance equation ( 2 ) and including in @xmath33 the maxwell tensor of magnetic field , one gets [ 2,4 ] @xmath34 on substitution @xmath35 in this tensor , we are convinced of its _ symmetry_. equation ( 4 ) and the momentum conservation law @xmath36 determine the equation of ferrofluid motion @xmath37 in the calculation of the divergence of the stress tensor we have used the equations @xmath38 i.e. , the ferrofluid is considered to be incompressible and non - conducting .",
    "the system of equations ( 5)-(6 ) is still not complete since it does not determine the ferrofluid magnetization .",
    "the latter influences the fluid motion ( see ( 5 ) ) and depends itself on the motion as well .",
    "there are two basic ways to derive the missing magnetization equation .",
    "both the ways have been proposed by the author with co - workers [ 2,5 ] and discussed in reviews [ 4,6,7 ] .",
    "originally the magnetization equation has been derived phenomenologically [ 2 ] as a modification of the debye relaxation equation [ 8 ] . to get the generalized equation",
    ", one should introduce a local reference frame @xmath39 , in which the suspended particles are quiescent _ on the average _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "it is natural to assume that the magnetization relaxation is described in the system by the simplest debye - like equation @xmath41 with @xmath42 from ( 3 ) .",
    "other words , it assumes that any deviation ( either in direction or magnitude ) of @xmath29 from its equilibrium value @xmath42 decays according to the simple exponential law @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 stands for the brownian time of rotational particle diffusion ( @xmath45 since the particles are assumed to be rigid magnetic dipoles whose reorientation is possible only with rotation of the particles themselves .",
    "the frame of reference @xmath39 rotates with respect to the fixed ( `` laboratory '' ) system @xmath46 with the angular velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the rates of change of any vector @xmath48 in systems @xmath46 and @xmath39 are related by the kinematic expression @xmath49 substituting here @xmath50 , @xmath13 from ( 2 ) , and @xmath51 from ( 7 ) , we obtain the equation sought : @xmath52 ( shliomis , 1972 ) . the last ( relaxation ) term in this equation",
    "describes a process of approach of the vector @xmath29 to its equilibrium orientation without change of the length of this vector .",
    "equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) constitute the complete set of conventional ferrohydrodynamic equations .",
    "let us compare eq .",
    "( 9 ) with the equation [ 1 ] @xmath53 ( felderhof , 2000 ) . here",
    "@xmath54 is a positive phenomenological constant and `` @xmath55 is expressed in terms of the local magnetization '' [ 1 ] , that requires an introduction of a very inconvenient notation @xmath56 , where @xmath57 means the function inverse to langevin function ( 3 ) . on the face of it , eq .",
    "( 10 ) is only much less convenient than ( 9 ) since the left- and right - hand sides of ( 10 ) contain _ different _ relaxing values : @xmath29 and @xmath58 .",
    "felderhof claims however that his  relaxation equation was _ derived _ from irreversible thermodynamics ( it ) , and differs from that _ postulated _ by shliomis .",
    "the two relaxation equations lead to a different dependence of viscosity on magnetic field .",
    "\" let us consider both these statements .    from the point of view of it , the relaxation term @xmath59 in ( 9 )",
    "is neither more nor less  postulated \" than the term @xmath60 in ( 10 ) .",
    "it is worth to remind , there are two methods of it , and the both was proposed by landau .",
    "the first of two , l1 , based on conservation laws and the condition of positive entropy production , was applied for the first time to the building of hydrodynamics of helium [ 9 ] , then  hydrodynamics of fluids with internal rotation [ 3 ] , liquid paramagnets [ 10 ] , and some other liquids .",
    "relaxation equation ( 10 ) has been also derived by the method .",
    "one has to be skilful enough to use this cumbrous method because it does not lead to the one and only form of sought equations . in this sense",
    "the second method , l2 , is much more definite , simple , and direct than l1 .",
    "it was first applied just to the description of relaxation of the order parameter in a non - equilibrium system [ 11 ] .",
    "an equilibrium value of the parameter ( @xmath61 in our case ) corresponds to the minimum of an appropriate thermodynamic potential @xmath62 ( usually the gibbs or helmholtz free energy ) depending on the magnetization @xmath29 and other thermodynamic variables .",
    "thus , at the equilibrium @xmath63 . out of equilibrium this condition is not satisfied , so the relaxation process occurs : @xmath64 changes in time approaching @xmath61 . for small deviations from equilibrium , the derivative @xmath65 and the relaxation rate @xmath66 are small .",
    "the relation between the two derivatives in the landau theory is reduced to simple proportionality : @xmath67 with a constant coefficient @xmath68 .",
    "hence we have @xmath69 as it should be : when a system moves to equilibrium , its free energy decreases . in the case of a weakly non - equilibrium state of the system",
    ", one can substitute in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) the expansion @xmath70 where subscript 0 marks the point of equilibrium . as the first derivative in this point is equal to zero and",
    "the second one is positive , eq .",
    "( 11 ) turns into eq .",
    "( 7 ) with @xmath71 and eq .",
    "( 12 ) takes the form @xmath72 thus , eq .",
    "( 7 ) and hence eq .",
    "( 9 ) are well corroborated by the method of it .",
    "equation ( 10 ) does also not conflict with it .",
    "nevertheless it is wrong .",
    "as we show below , it leads to anomalous result for ferrofluid viscosity and magnetization relaxation time .",
    "the pitfall of it is discussed in sec .",
    "the einstein formula for viscosity of suspension , @xmath73 , was obtained without taking into account the rotational motion of suspended particles relative to carrier liquid .",
    "if however the particles angular velocity @xmath13 does not coincide with the angular velocity of the fluid @xmath74 , there arise friction forces which manifest themselves in an additional ( so - called _ rotational _ ) viscosity @xmath75 . as the difference @xmath76",
    "is maintained by the magnetic torque ( see ( 2 ) ) , rotational viscosity turns out to be a function of the dimensionless field strength @xmath77 . in a stationary field , the steady solution of eq . ( 9 ) yields in the linear order in @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the relaxation time of the transverse ( to the field ) component of the magnetization . for the poiseuille flow or the planar couette flow under the field directed along the flow ( i.e. , @xmath81 )",
    ", we find @xmath82 while for arbitrary orientation of magnetic field the right - hand side of the expression should be multiplied by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the angle between vectors @xmath28 and @xmath74 .",
    "let us substitute the magnetic torque ( 15 ) in ( 5 ) . when the field @xmath28 is homogeneous , the magnetic force @xmath85 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) vanishes , while two other terms of the equation may be grouped : @xmath86 the quantity added here to the ordinary viscosity should be regarded as rotational viscosity @xmath87 substituting here @xmath88 from ( 3 ) and @xmath89 from ( 14 ) , we derive the formula [ 2 ] @xmath90 in the absence of magnetic field an individual particle  rolls  freely along corresponding shear surface with angular velocity @xmath13 equal to @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 .",
    "conversely , @xmath93 attains its limiting value @xmath94 ( the saturation ) when _ rolling _ of the particle is replaced by _ slipping _ : the field of sufficiently large intensity guarantees constancy of the particle s orientation , not allowing it to twist with the fluid .",
    "note that the result ( 18 ) does _ not depend _ on a concrete form of the magnetization equation but follows directly from the equation of fluid motion ( 5 ) .",
    "actually , in the limit under consideration @xmath95 , so that eq .",
    "( 2 ) takes the form @xmath96 . substituting this torque in ( 5 ) , we immediately arrive at ( 18 ) .",
    "indeed , the value was obtained by hall and busenberg [ 12 ] as early as 1969 _ without use _ of any magnetization equation . in any case , however , such an equation must not contradict the saturation value ( 18 ) .",
    "our formula ( 17 ) does satisfy the limit ( 18 ) , whereas felderhof s equation ( 10 ) leads to the quite different result .",
    "his final formula in [ 1 ] gives the value @xmath97 which is _ evidently less _ than the correct value ( 18 ) . according to [ 1 ] , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the initial magnetic susceptibility . substituting the @xmath100 and @xmath101 in ( 19 )",
    "we find @xmath102 , afterwards eq .",
    "( 19 ) yields @xmath103 .",
    "thus the ratio of the felderhof s limiting value of viscosity to the correct value ( 18 ) is equal to 0.6 .",
    "other words , in the limit @xmath104 felderhof s equation ( 10 ) predicts @xmath105 ( ? ! ) instead of @xmath106 as it _ must be_.",
    "both the above - mentioned phenomenological methods allow to obtain _ linear _ relaxation terms in hydrodynamic equations [ like @xmath107 in ( 9 ) ] and corresponding quadratic terms for the rate of the entropy growth or the free energy diminution ( like that in ( 13 ) ) .",
    "it is clear that such terms are valid only for small departures from equilibrium . indeed , eq .",
    "( 9 ) describes well the rotational viscosity for arbitrary intensity of a stationary magnetic field but small values of @xmath108 ( see , e.g. , a good agreement between mctague s experiment [ 13 ] and shliomis theory [ 2 ] ) , or for small dimensionless amplitude @xmath77 or frequency @xmath109 of an alternating magnetic field ( see , e.g. , experiments on the _ negative viscosity _ and their explanation in [ 14 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , to describe successfully the negative ferrofluid viscosity at finite values of the parameters , we did need to use in [ 15,16 ] a more precise magnetization equation .",
    "such a _ macroscopic _ equation should be derived from the kinetic fokker ",
    "planck equation which provides the _ microscopic _ description of particle diffusion in colloids .",
    "the program was realized by martsenyuk , raikher and shliomis [ 5 ] soon after the phenomenological magnetization equation ( 9 ) was derived in [ 2 ] .",
    "the fokker ",
    "planck equation for a ferrofluid moving in a field @xmath28 has the form [ 7 ] @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the unite vector along a particle magnetic moment , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the infinitesimal rotation operator .",
    "equation ( 20 ) determines the orientational distribution function @xmath114 of particles magnetic moments .",
    "the macroscopic magnetization is determined by the relation @xmath115 where angular brackets denote statistical averaging with the distribution function .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( 20 ) by @xmath116 and integrate over the angles , we arrive at the equation @xmath117 which however is not closed .",
    "indeed , along with the first moment of the distribution function , @xmath118 , eq .",
    "( 21 ) contains the second moment ( the last term in the equation ) .",
    "it is easy to make sure that the equation for the second moment includes the third one , and so on , thus there is the infinite chain of cross - linked equations .",
    "ideally , however , one would like to have only one equation since only the first moment  magnetization  has a clear physical meaning .",
    "an original scheme of closure of the first - moment equation ( 21 ) , titled the _ effective field method , _ has been proposed in [ 5 ] .",
    "let us explain the fruitful physical idea .    in equilibrium @xmath119 under a constant magnetic field the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( 20 ) is the gibbs distribution @xmath120 an averaging of the vector @xmath116 with function ( 22 ) gives expression ( 3 ) for the equilibrium magnetization : @xmath121 only in true equilibrium the magnetization is one or another function of the field . in a non - equilibrium state there is _ no connection _ between @xmath29 and @xmath122 : any arbitrary magnetization may be created  in principle  even in the absence of the field .",
    "nevertheless , one may consider any value of @xmath29 as an equilibrium magnetization in a certain  specially prepared  magnetic field .",
