    "the results of atmospheric and solar neutrino observations  @xcite indicate that neutrinos have non - zero mass .",
    "although very small , the neutrino mass can play a key role in new physics underlying the standard model of particle physics @xcite .",
    "the standard model considers all three neutrino flavor states ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) as massless .",
    "thus , observations show the standard model needs some corrections or extensions .",
    "so far , many models have been proposed for the massive neutrino  @xcite , and many experiments have been carried out for measuring this mass .",
    "experiments with tritium @xmath5-decay gave controversial results : the neutrino mass squared appears to be negative .",
    "@xcite the current experimental upper limits for the neutrino masses ( by the particle data group ) @xcite :    @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( in @xmath9 ) + are based on the averaged data from kinematic determinations .",
    "astrophysical data  @xcite give stronger constraints :    @xmath10 @xmath11 ( for all species ) .",
    "+ recently , the author has proposed a new composite model of fermions @xcite , in which the neutrino is described as a majorana particle , almost massless in free states , but acquiring a substantial mass if bonded to a charged particle .",
    "the model satisfactorily ( to an accuracy of @xmath12 ) predicts masses of the fundamental fermions ( quarks and charged leptons ) but , being approximate , it can not reproduce masses of neutral particles , such as neutrinos or photons , as well as of the weak gauge bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "here we discuss this problem and propose its possible solution in the form of a hypothetical symmetry between fermion and boson mass structures .",
    "the model  @xcite is based on the idea of compositeness of fermions .",
    "properties of their primitive constituents ( `` preons '' ) are limited to the su(3)-symmetry of colored - charges and a mass . for simplicity ,",
    "we use unit values for the preon s mass and charge .",
    "it is supposed that by rotational transformations the preon can be translated into one of its six possible color / charge states .",
    "preons of different colors and charges should group in equilibrium configurations corresponding to the symmetry of their potentials .",
    "these configurations are identified with known particles .",
    "it was shown that masses of the composite fermions can be calculated as sums of the masses of their constituents ( preons ) , if the composite particle is `` rigid '' .",
    "for the `` non - rigid '' structures , the following formula @xmath13 can be used .",
    "the `` rigidness '' of a particle is determined by the structure of its effective potential .",
    "simpler potentials ( having , say , a single minimum ) should correspond to more `` rigid '' structures .",
    "these are  in our model  the first family fermions .",
    "the second and third families are clusters of particles rather than rigid structures .",
    "the masses in ( [ eq.mtotal ] ) are expressed in units of the preon s mass .",
    "they can be converted into conventional units , say , proton mass units ( @xmath14 ) , by calculating @xmath14 with ( [ eq.mtotal ] ) and dividing all other calculated masses by this value .",
    "the masses can be converted also into @xmath9 by using a conversion factor @xmath15 $ ] derived from the experimental fermion masses  @xcite ( @xmath16 stands for the preon ) .",
    "three like - charged preons with complementary colors will combine in a y - shaped triplet .",
    "the triplet has a mass of three preons , @xmath17 , and a charge @xmath18 preon units .",
    "the minimal - length closed loop composed of six preon - antipreon triplet pairs @xmath19 , can be associated with the electron - neutrino , @xmath20 .",
    "the charges and masses of the adjacent unlike - charged constituents ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are considered to almost cancel mutually . in this notation ,",
    "the structure of the electron / positron can be written as @xmath23 / @xmath24 , with a charge @xmath25 and a mass @xmath26 preon units ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) . in our model , a neutral massless particle ,",
    "if `` rigidly '' coupled to a charged particle , restores its mass .",
    "the mass of such a system will be equal to the sum of the masses of its preons , and its charge will correspond to the charge of its charged component .",
    "for instance , the mass of the system @xmath29 is the sum of @xmath30 and 36 unit masses of the preons constituing @xmath2 ( total 39 preon mass units ) .",
    "its charge ( @xmath31 ) corresponds to the charge of a single y - particle .",
    "we identify the chain @xmath32 with the @xmath33-quark .",
    "its charge is equal to the charge of two @xmath22-particles ( @xmath34 ) and its mass is the sum of two @xmath35 : total 78 mass units or @xmath36 @xmath28 .",
    "the positively charged @xmath33-quark , combined with the negatively charged structure @xmath37 , forms the @xmath38-quark , @xmath39 , with its charge of @xmath40 units and a mass of @xmath41 units ( @xmath42 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the structure @xmath43 , which has properties of the weak gauge boson ( see table 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , consists of 45 preons ( 9 preons of the electron and 36 preons of @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , its mass should be about 2.6 @xmath28 if it is in a rigid structure , or almost zero if considered as a cluster of @xmath2 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , the experimental mass of @xmath0 is @xmath45 , indicating that ( [ eq.mtotal ] ) is not applicable to bosons . even for @xmath46 the calculated mass of",
    "@xmath0 increases very little , still disagreeing with experiment .",
    "the problem can be resolved by using a reciprocal formula @xmath47 for bosons , instead of ( [ eq.mtotal ] ) , assuming a symmetrical relationship between the boson and fermion mass structures .",
    "the physical justification for this assumption is analogous to that of supersymmetry , but here it is based on the dualism of space introduced in ref .",
    "we suppose that two reciprocal manifestations of space are interchangeable for fermions and bosons .",
    "( [ eq.mtotal2 ] ) reproduces the large @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "in fact , had the electron - neutrino mass be taken as zero , the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 would become infinite .",
    "varying @xmath48 in ( [ eq.mtotal2 ] ) , one can obtain a realistic mass for the weak gauge boson . the following electron - neutrino mass @xmath49\\ ] ] ( or @xmath50 preon mass units ) fits the experimental value  @xcite of @xmath51 ( 1416578 preon mass units ) and the mass of the electron , @xmath26 , expressed in preon mass units .",
    "the tolerance interval is translated from @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite the muon- and tau - neutrinos are formed by consecutive additions of the unlike - charged pairs @xmath53 and @xmath54 to the electron - neutrino .",
    "we conjecture that the muon - neutrino have one such pair in its structure : @xmath55 and the tau - neutrino might have two such pairs : @xmath56 both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constituents of the tau - lepton where , together with @xmath57 , they are clustered in two components , @xmath58 and @xmath4 : @xmath59 } } } }                       }           { \\raisebox{-0.2cm}{\\fbox{{\\tiny 1 } } } }         }   { \\stackrel{\\raisebox{-0.7 cm } { {                $ \\underbrace{[\\stackrel{\\raisebox{0.1cm}{{$\\nu_\\tau$ } } }                               { \\overbrace {                                           ( \\overline{{\\sf y}}\\nu_e ) \\nu_e ( \\nu_e { \\sf y } ) \\nu_e ( \\overline{{\\sf y}}\\nu_e )                                                      \\nu_e ( \\nu_e{\\sf y } )                                                                           }           }                        ] }                                $ } } }           { \\raisebox{0.4cm}{\\fbox{{\\tiny 2 } } } } } \\raisebox{1.1cm}{\\hspace{0.1cm}. }   \\ ] ] here the clustered components are grouped in brackets and marked with the boxed numbers .",
    "the number of preons ( mass ) of the first component is @xmath60 with this value in ( [ eq.mtotal2 ] ) and taking into account the known experimental mass  @xcite of the tau - lepton , @xmath61 @xmath28 ( 31297.3 in preon mass units ) , one can translate @xmath62 into the tau - neutrino mass : @xmath63\\ ] ] ( or @xmath64 preon mass units ) .",
    "the muon - neutrino mass can not be estimated in the same way as @xmath48 or @xmath65 , because there are no particles containing @xmath3 as a separate component within their structures .",
    "for example , the muon structure ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) can be written as : @xmath66                                         [ \\nu_e \\nu_e ( \\nu_e { \\sf y } ) ] ,                                 }                     }           }           { \\raisebox{-0.4cm}{\\hspace{0.6 cm } \\fbox{\\tiny 2 } } }   \\raisebox{0.1cm}{\\hspace{0.1cm}}\\ ] ] which includes @xmath3 .",
    "but , having its own substructure , @xmath3 is shared here between two components , and .",
    "using the known experimental muon mass @xcite , @xmath67 [ @xmath28 ] ( 1860.9168 preon mass units ) and @xmath69 preon mass units , one can evaluate the upper limit for the muon - neutrino mass : @xmath70 @xmath11 .",
    "however , it would be more logical to suppose that @xmath71 lies somewhere between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ; that is , @xmath74.\\ ] ]",
    "the @xmath1-boson is a photon - like particle with high mass . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , its structure can be written as : @xmath75 from this , by using @xmath76 ( @xmath77 preon mass units ) and the known experimental mass of @xmath1 ( @xmath78 or 1606047 preon mass units ) , one can estimate the electron - neutrino mass : @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 preon mass units ) .",
    "this is smaller than ( [ eq.nue ] ) , but the structure of @xmath1 is more complex than that of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the possible underestimation of @xmath48 might be caused by overestimation of @xmath81 . using ( [ eq.nue ] ) and @xmath82",
    ", one can calculate @xmath83\\ ] ] ( or @xmath84 preon mass units ) .",
    "the symmetry introduced here between bosons and fermions permits the estimation of the neutrino masses , based on the experimental values for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , or @xmath87 .",
    "however , our estimations are made for the neutrinos interacting with other particles .",
    "thus , the calculated @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 should probably be considered only as upper limits for the free neutrino masses .",
