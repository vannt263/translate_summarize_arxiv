    "the quantum heisenberg model represents a long - standing theoretical challenge in the condensed matter physics especially due to insurmountable mathematical complexities associated with a non - commutability of spin operators involved in its hamiltonian .",
    "the non - commutability between the relevant spin operators raises a zero - point motion ( quantum fluctuations ) and consequently , low - dimensional antiferromagnets often exhibit a variety of exotic ground states owing to quantum phase transitions driven by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "by contrast , low - dimensional ferromagnets are usually thought of as being less affected by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "several low - dimensional quantum heisenberg models can exactly be solved merely on behalf of their special geometries @xcite .",
    "simple geometries , which are solely composed of inter - connecting diamonds , turned out to be a very useful testing ground for elucidating quantum properties of the low - dimensional spin systems @xcite . in our previous work , we have proposed the ising - heisenberg model on decorated planar lattices consisting of inter - connected diamonds in order to clarify a mutual interplay between the long - range magnetic order and quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the rigorous solution revealed a surprisingly rich ground - state phase diagram even for the ferromagnetic model , which consists of the classical ferromagnetic phase ( cfp ) , the quantum ferromagnetic phase ( qfp ) and the disordered phase ( dp ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark , moreover , that dp originates from a peculiar geometric spin frustration related to the competition between the easy - axis and easy - plane interactions .",
    "therefore , the purpose of the present work is to shed light on how this competition influences ( dis)appearance of spontaneous ordering of two long - range ordered phases cfp and qfp .",
    "first , let us briefly describe the hybrid ising - heisenberg model on the decorated triangular lattice constituted by inter - connected diamonds as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the considered lattice is formed by two different spin sites schematically depicted in fig .  1 as full and empty circles , respectively .",
    "the former spin sites are occupied by the spin-1/2 ising atoms described by spin operators @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , while the latter ones are occupied by the spin-1 heisenberg atoms described by spin operators @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be for convenience defined as a sum of bond hamiltonians , @xmath4 , where each bond hamiltonian @xmath5 - d [ ( \\hat{s}_{k1}^z)^2 + ( \\hat{s}_{k2}^z)^2 ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! & - & \\ ! \\ ! \\ !",
    "j_{\\rm i } ( \\hat{s}_{k1}^z + \\hat{s}_{k2}^z ) ( \\hat{\\mu}_{k1}^z + \\hat{\\mu}_{k2}^z ) \\label{1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] involves all the interactions terms of one diamond - like spin cluster residing on the @xmath6th bond of the triangular lattice . above , the parameter @xmath7 represents the anisotropic xxz heisenberg interaction between the nearest - neighbouring spin-1 atoms , @xmath8 is a spatial anisotropy in this exchange interaction , whereas the parameter @xmath9 measures a strength of the uniaxial single - ion anisotropy acting on the spin-1 atoms . finally , the parameter @xmath10 denotes the ising - like exchange interaction between the nearest - neighbouring spin-1/2 and spin-1 atoms , respectively .    the aforedescribed ising - heisenberg model can accurately be treated by adopting the well - known procedure based on the exact decoration - iteration mapping transformation @xcite . as a result of this mapping ,",
    "the partition function @xmath11 of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising - heisenberg model on the diamond - like decorated triangular lattice can be expressed in terms of the partition function @xmath12 of the spin-1/2 ising model on the simple triangular lattice with some effective nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath13 @xmath14 note that both mapping parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 are unambiguously determined by a self - consistency condition of the mapping transformation and their explicit form is given by eqs .",
    "47 of ref .",
    "it directly follows from the relation ( [ 2 ] ) that the hybrid ising - heisenberg model becomes critical if and only if its corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the triangular lattice becomes critical , as well .",
    "accordingly , the exact critical temperature @xmath16 of the hybrid ising - heisenberg model must obey the condition @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "the dependence of reduced critical temperature on the anisotropy parameters @xmath8 and @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by keeping the ratio @xmath20 constant .",
    "as it can be clearly seen , the model under investigation displays a rather complex critical behaviour that depends very sensitively on a strength of both anisotropy parameters .    within the finite - temperature phase diagram one actually finds several regions where the system exhibits reentrant phase transitions with two consecutive critical temperatures , which might be even relatively well separated .",
    "generally , the reentrance presumably occurs either if the single - ion anisotropy is of an easy - axis type ( @xmath21 ) and the exchange anisotropy is of an easy - plane type ( @xmath22 ) or if the reverse is the case .",
    "this indicates that the reentrance is closely related to a competition between the easy - plane and easy - axis interactions , while the latter one is also supported by the ising interaction @xmath10 .",
    "besides , it is worthwhile to remark that the most interesting part of the finite - temperature phase diagram includes closed loops of phase transition lines , which separate the long - range ordered phase ( either cfp or qfp ) from the disordered one . notice that the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] have been convincingly evidenced also by a detailed analysis of the spontaneous magnetization , which represents the order parameter for both ferromagnetic phases cfp and qfp .    in conclusion",
    ", it should be mentioned that the critical behaviour of the ising - heisenberg models on different diamond - like decorated planar lattices basically depends also on a lattice topology even though all lattices have the same ground - state phase diagram regardless of their coordination number @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "more systematic study that would clarify this issue in detail is left for our future work ."
