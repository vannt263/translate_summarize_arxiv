    "the field of quantum many body systems has been boosted tremendously by the investigation of quantum information motivated quantities such as von neumann or renyi entanglement entropies applied to strongly correlated quantum matter  @xcite .",
    "important achievements are the discovery of area laws controlling the entanglement properties of ground states of local gapped hamiltonians  @xcite , that entanglement entropies encode topological properties of matter  @xcite , or that the logarithmic corrections of the area law in one - dimensional critical systems are governed by the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .",
    "more recently the entanglement spectrum - i.e. the negative logarithm of the eigenvalues of a reduced density matrix - has been proposed as a novel tool to obtain insightful information beyond the information content of individual entanglement entropies  @xcite .",
    "more specifically let us consider a bipartition of a system into two complementary parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the corresponding schmidt decomposition of a wave function @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are orthonormal vectors in subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , and @xmath7 are the so called entanglement spectrum levels , related to the eigenvalues @xmath8 of the corresponding reduced density matrix through the relation @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that for fractional quantum hall states the entanglement spectrum @xmath7 arranges in close analogy to the energy spectrum of a physical edge . this observation sparked a lot of activity exploring the physical information contained in the entanglement spectrum e.g. in topological quantum matter  @xcite , in continuous symmetry breaking states  @xcite or in one - dimensional critical systems described by a cft  @xcite .",
    "so far numerical entanglement spectra have been obtained mainly using wave function based numerical approaches such as exact diagonalization  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite or tensor network states  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent advances in measuring renyi entropies in quantum monte carlo methods ( qmc )  @xcite we want to explore in this paper to what extent current quantum monte carlo methods are suitable to reconstruct entanglement spectra .",
    "the basic idea is to measure the trace of the first @xmath0 powers of a reduced density matrix using a replica approach , and then to infer @xmath0 eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices based on the measured moments .",
    "this problem is a particular instance of the ( truncated ) hausdorff problem  @xcite and known to be an ill - conditioned problem , similar to the analytic continuation problem arising in the monte carlo evaluation of spectral functions .",
    "an additional complication is the presence of statistical uncertainties of the renyi entropies similar to the situation of a statistical hausdorff problem considered in ref .  .    with these limitations in mind",
    "it is our goal to explore how far one can go with current technologies .",
    "while the full reconstruction of the entanglement spectrum is clearly out of reach , a particle number resolved measurement technique allows us to track roughly the lowest few entanglement spectra levels per sector with reasonable effort , provided the eigenvalues are of similar magnitude .",
    "we illustrate the approach by simulating the one - dimensional extended bose - hubbard model focusing on the mott insulator and the haldane insulator .",
    "we demonstrate that our qmc approach is able to detect the quasi - degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum in the haldane insulator versus the non - degeneracy in the mott insulator .",
    "the @xmath0th renyi entropy , @xmath10 , can be accessed in ( quantum ) monte carlo using the replica trick  @xcite that links the @xmath0th moment of the reduced density matrix to a ratio of two partition functions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the usual partition function for a system at temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the partition function living on a @xmath0-sheeted riemann surface of temporal extent @xmath16 with @xmath17 equal - time branch - cuts at times @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) along the extent of subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "here we use a continuous time worm algorithm  @xcite that operates in the path integral representation of the partition functions and allows for an efficient sampling of @xmath20 when the normal world - line update is supplemented with a global update scheme devised in ref .  .",
    "starting from @xmath21 , the global update tries to connect the world lines along the branch cuts within @xmath1 .",
    "if the world lines at @xmath22 can be connected to @xmath23 ( note the periodicity in imaginary time ) , the world line sheets are transfromed to this non - trivial geometry @xmath15 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wld ] . an inverse move tries to recut the world lines at all @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath20 is estimated by simply counting how often the system is in one or the other world line configuration .    .",
    "the right hand side illustrates the _ imaginary time increment trick _ used to estimate @xmath20 . ]",
    "as @xmath1 grows the transition probability in the global update decreases rapidly and the simulation becomes rather inefficient . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) as @xmath24 [ z_{a_2}^{(n)}/z_{a_1}^{(n ) } ] ... [ z_{a}^{(n)}/z_{a_k}^{(n)}]$ ] with @xmath25 , large subsystem sizes can be accessed by successively growing the subsystem and evaluating each partition function ratio in square brackets separately  @xcite .    accessing higher",
    "renyi entropies poses a similar challenge since the number of branch cuts increases . to cure this inefficiency",
    ", we conceive an _ imaginary time increment trick _ by realizing that the partition function ratio can be rewritten as @xmath26 thus , the @xmath0th renyi entropy requires the calculation of @xmath27 as well as the evaluation of a partition function ratio between two geometries with a _ single _ branch cut , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wld ] .",
    "this improved scheme allows us to access renyi entropies as high as @xmath28 and can readily be generalized to different implementations .",
    "although it is possible to access also higher renyi entropies efficiently with this update scheme we restricted ourselves to the calculation of up to the fourth moment since including higher moments will not improve the reconstruction of the entanglement spectrum given the current accuracy of our data as it will be detailed in the following section .       in a periodic chain with @xmath29 of an extended bose - hubbard model at unit filling with @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "( hi , left panel ) and @xmath32 ( mi , right panel ) obtained using @xmath33 .",
    "an ( artificial ) degeneracy is indicated by numbers below the data points . only the lowest four dmrg levels per sector are shown . ]",
    "the knowledge of all integer renyi entropies in principle provides all the information required to extract the entanglement spectrum  @xcite by , for instance , solving a large system of coupled non - linear equations .",
    "we explored several entanglement spectrum reconstruction approaches including an optimization techniques over the @xmath0 eigenvalues .",
    "since this operation has to be performed many times in the binning analysis of the monte carlo time series , we chose to rely on the recent work by song _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which presented a nice way to relate the @xmath20 quantities to the characteristic polynomial of @xmath34 .",
    "in our setup we can only get accurate data up to certain @xmath0 , so we simply approximate the full characteristic polynomial by an order @xmath0 truncation . finding the roots of a polynomial with noisy coefficients can , in general , be challenging ( see e.g. ref .  ) , for example the roots can sometimes shift away from the real axis and cluster in pairs , thereby acquiring a small imaginary part that will be omitted .   this does not , however , affect the normalization condition @xmath35 since the imaginary parts cancel .",
    "the main difficulty in reconstructing the spectrum of the reduced density matrix is that the eigenvalues @xmath36 can extend over several orders of magnitude .",
    "higher moments , on the other hand , are dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38^n + ... ) $ ] , providing a threshold for the resolvable eigenvalues given an error on @xmath20 .",
    "an improvement of the reconstruction procedure is to take advantage of the block structure of the density matrix that stems from particle number conservation ( or any other quantum numbers that are easily accessible in qmc ) . to be more specific",
    ", we calculate the moments of @xmath34 in each particle number sector labelled by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the number of particles in block @xmath1 and @xmath41 is the average particle number ) separately by binning the measurements into the respective sectors .",
    "we combine the data for symmetric blocks with @xmath42 and @xmath43 to improve the accuracy of our data .",
    "and we checked explicitly that the data for blocks with @xmath44 agrees within the error bars . ]    the power of our approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , where we show entanglement spectra for two different parameter sets in a one - dimensional extended bose hubbard model . the model as well as the physics of the spectra",
    "will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosehubbard ] below .",
    "here we just want to highlight the good agreement between the qmc reconstruction of the lowest entanglement spectrum level in each sector ( corresponding to the largest eigenvalues @xmath36 ) and the reference dmrg results .",
    "furthermore also the second entanglement spectrum level in each sector is rather accurate , provided the @xmath45 values are not separated by a large gap from the first level in the same sector .",
    "for a more thorough application we now turn to the extended bose - hubbard model here given in terms of standard bosonic operators as @xmath46 recent analytical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies revealed that its phase diagram features a topologically non - trivial haldane insulating ( hi ) phase besides more conventional phases such as a mott insulator ( mi ) and a charge density wave phase ( cdw ) .",
    "the hi is closely linked to the haldane phase in spin @xmath47 chains that does not break a local symmetry but has non - local string order and a characteristic degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum protected by a set of symmetries  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of unit filling and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and sketch the phase diagram , obtained from ref .",
    ", in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sxi](a ) .",
    "the simulations are performed along the line @xmath30 where the system can be tuned from the cdw at lower @xmath48 to the hi at @xmath49 . upon further increasing the on - site interaction , one eventually enters the mi at @xmath50 .      as a preparatory step",
    "we investigate the behavior of the second renyi entropy of a half system block @xmath51 across the two phase transitions . in a gapped phase the entropy of a block saturates as a function of the block size by virtue of the strict area law . at a quantum critical point with conformal symmetry",
    "however , the entanglement entropies exhibit a logarithmic correction , whose coefficient is directly related to the central charge @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the chord length of block @xmath1 and @xmath55 is a non - universal constant . when considering the entropy increment upon increasing the system and block size  @xcite : @xmath56,\\ ] ] this quantity displays a peak at the location of the quantum phase transition and its peak value corresponds to the central charge of the transition . in the gapped phase @xmath57 tends to zero with increasing system sizes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxi](a ) we find two distinct peaks with @xmath58 ( cdw - hi ) and @xmath59 ( hi - mi ) in accordance with the expected presence of an ising and a gaussian critical point respectively  @xcite . furthermore our qmc data  also for higher renyi entropies ( not shown )",
    " agrees perfectly with the reference dmrg results .",
    "we now turn towards the analysis of the entanglement spectrum as a function of @xmath60 for fixed @xmath30 , focussing on the mi and hi phases . in insightful papers pollmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite realized that the hi phase can be characterized by a particular degeneracy structure of the entire entanglement spectrum . in the pbc setup",
    "we consider , there are two distinct boundaries separating the two parts of the system and the degeneracy of the lowest lying multiplet is four in this case , with a quantum number structure as shown in the left panel of  fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , i.e.  two levels at @xmath61 and one level each at @xmath62 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxi](b ) and ( c ) we now display the @xmath60 dependence of the qmc reconstructed es based on the method outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : methextr ] .",
    "the gray squares denote data reconstructed using @xmath63 , whereas the colored dots correspond to @xmath33 . in panel fig .",
    "[ fig : sxi](d ) we display the lowest two levels for @xmath61 and @xmath64 for @xmath29 and @xmath65 in the hi .",
    "one can clearly see that the lowest four levels become closer for increasing system size , eventually leading to the four - fold degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , the qmc calculations nicely capture this feature and agree with the dmrg results .",
    "taking either three or four moments of the density matrix , the lowest two levels of the entanglement spectrum can be captured quite well .",
    "although the @xmath33 data for the third level in the @xmath61 sector agrees with the dmrg results qualitatively , the quantitative agreement is not as good as for the lower levels .",
    "this effect is readily understood as a small and finite number of entanglement levels will necessarily lead to a deformation of the spectrum  some of the @xmath45s are typically shifted downwards because the complete trace has to be incorporated in very few levels .",
    "a second observation is that the entanglement gap in the respective particle number sectors has a substantial influence on the quality of the obtained spectrum .",
    "the separation of the @xmath45 values for large @xmath48 increases the domination of the first level and hence requires a much better resolution as compared to the haldane phase where the lowest two levels are almost degenerate .",
    "we find that we can actually resolve entanglement levels only below a threshold @xmath66 $ ] given by the error on the highest moment .",
    "this threshold , that is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxi ] , stems from the observation that the overall precision of the moments has to be comparable or better than the summands one tries to resolve and also incorporates the fact that smaller eigenvalues of the density matrix are suppressed exponentially , i.e. like @xmath67 , for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "will yield a better resolution of the entaglement spectrum since the absolute precision due to the truncation of the spectrum will become worse . ] above the error threshold the spectrum easily acquires false degeneracies , as discussed previously , or some of the reconstructed eigenvalues can become purely imaginary and are thus omitted .",
    "in this paper we have presented an approach to reconstruct the entanglement spectrum of quantum many body systems by measuring particle number resolved higher moments of reduced density matrices in qmc . to effectively calculate larger @xmath0 renyi entropies ,",
    "an enhanced increment scheme is presented that greatly improves the global topology updates of the world lines .",
    "we are in fact able to recover the low lying degenerate levels in the hi insulator and show that this degeneracy does not persist in the mi phase where , however , our method fails to quantitatively capture the higher - lying part of the spectrum of the mi because of the large separation of levels .",
    "our approach is not only limited to the qmc methods described in this paper .",
    "similar procedures can potentially be applied to variational monte carlo ( vmc ) evaluation of trial wavefunctions , going beyond the 2nd renyi entropy calculations performed so far  @xcite , and thus potentially access a few of the largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices .",
    "another interesting aspect is that using the protocol put forward in ref .",
    "it seems possible to both obtain higher @xmath68 as well as particle number resolved traces @xmath69 $ ] , so that a partial reconstruction of the entanglement spectrum in experiments on large bosonic systems might become possible in the future .",
