    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cp violation in susy has been studied extensively at low energies , in meson mixing @xcite , in the @xmath4-meson system @xcite and in electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> edms in particular provide quite stringent constraints on the low - energy cp - violating susy phases of the superparticle couplings . for certain values of the susy parameters , there is a disagreement with the experimental limits , resulting in the so - called susy cp problem . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we make extensive use of the computer program cpsuperh2.0 @xcite in choosing values for the various susy parameters in our processes . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent version of this program allows the user to compute edms , as well as various other low - energy observables .    in a given decay , </S>",
    "<S> there are three types of cp - violating signals . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is the partial rate asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> any difference in the rate between process and cp - conjugate process is a signal of cp violation . as we will see , it is possible that the partial rate asymmetry is sizeable ( of order 5 - 10% for the processes considered ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , one has the modified ( spin - dependent ) rate asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> here one compares the rate for process and cp - conjugate process for the case in which the spin of one of the particles has been measured . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement is complicated , and so , given that the partial rate asymmetry can be significant , we do not consider the modified rate asymmetry in this paper . the third cp - violating signal is the triple - product ( tp ) asymmetry , which is proportional to @xmath18 ( each @xmath19 is a spin or momentum ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to terms of the form @xmath20 $ ] in the square of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> since only 3-body decays are considered here , a nonzero tp can arise only if a spin or polarization is measured . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , such measurements are difficult , and so we do not consider tps here . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the only cp - violating signal analyzed in this paper is the partial rate asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> all effects that violate cp require the interference of ( at least ) two amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the partial rate asymmetry is proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the relative strong ( cp - even ) phase between the interfering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> strong phases can be generated in one of two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can have the exchange of gluons between the particles involved in the decay , leading to qcd - based strong phases . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we do not know how to calculate the strong phases in this case . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the strong phases can be generated by the ( known ) widths of the intermediate particles in the decay . in the decays considered in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , the particles do not couple to gluons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the strong phase arises only due to the widths of the intermediate particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is good , given that we want to _ measure _ the cp violation , and not simply detect its presence .    </S>",
    "<S> now , susy includes two higgs doublets which contain ( in the gauge basis ) two neutral scalars and one pseudoscalar . in the mass basis , these particles mix and one obtains three mass eigenstates @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in susy theories , </S>",

    "<S> such diagrams can benefit from a resonant enhancement . </S>",

    "<S> the case of internal neutralinos ( which appear in the case @xmath39 ) is more complicated . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , these could be on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we do not know their widths , making their contributions to the rate asymmetry uncertain . in practice , for the cases that we consider , the two heavier neutralinos have masses close to @xmath40 and </S>",
    "<S> the two lighter neutralinos have masses close to or less than @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the examples we consider , the neutralinos can not go on shell and the uncertainty associated with the neutralinos ( unknown ) widths is mitigated .    in order for a given partial rate asymmetry to be appreciable </S>",
    "<S> , the interfering amplitudes should be of comparable sizes . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , since the rate asymmetries depend on an integration over phase space , the `` large '' contributions from these amplitudes should occur in similar regions of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this latter requirement is met if the masses of the on - shell particles , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are similar . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is relatively common in susy theories that @xmath42  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitudes of most interest to us , therefore , are those dominated by internal @xmath24 and @xmath25 exchange . in calculating the square of the amplitude , however , we retain the contributions of various non - resonant diagrams ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> imposing the constraints from table  [ tab : table1 ] leads to relatively strong limits on the susy parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this led us to make a third change : to increase the efficiency of our numerical work , we allowed @xmath80 only to take on the values @xmath77 and @xmath108 , and we restricted @xmath71 so that it took on values between @xmath109 and @xmath110 . </S>",

    "<S> this value should be understood as a very crude estimate , since the @xmath127 production cross section is strongly dependent on the susy parameters and since we have not preformed a detailed analysis , nor considered the case of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> our point is simply to show that a 10% partial rate asymmetry could well be reachable .    in conclusion , if susy is discovered in future experiments , it will become important to measure the underlying parameters of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this paper has examined four chargino decay modes that could help provide insight into the cp nature of the theory . in particular , we have computed partial rate asymmetries for the decays @xmath130 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> rate asymmetries have an advantage over some other cp - violating observables in that no spins or polarizations need to be measured . </S>",
