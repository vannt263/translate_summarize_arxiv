    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( d , e ) , and the reduction is much more pronounced for the nanocavity in fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( e ) ( the nano cavity exhibits a more than 10-fold decrease at @xmath108 for @xmath109 ghz . )    figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath78 for a cavity loss @xmath99 ( chosen around @xmath110 ) . for both cavities </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath111 at small @xmath2 due to the enhanced dark path effect . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath111-dependency and an observation that the dark pumping path reduces the quality of qd sp emissions for slow spin relaxations originate from the same physics explained above . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case of the microcavity , the @xmath111-dependency is not found in the typical parameter regime ( @xmath102 : the shaded region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , meaning the dark path rarely causes the unwanted effect of multiple photon emission . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this effect is always important in the small ph - c nanocavity , since the @xmath111-dependency is found in the typical regime .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary _ the strong impact of the `` dark path'' a pumping path via dark exciton states to biexciton states  on the quality of sp emitters has been shown to exist in qd systems . </S>",
    "<S> the observed increase in the value of @xmath0 indicates the dark path can reduce quality of qd sp emitters , especially those situated in small cavities like nanocavities . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the dark path were investigated under cw excitation conditions , but will also manifest themselves under long - pulse excitation . the effect of short - pulse excitation will be discussed elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we mention several ways to reduce the impact of the dark path for an application purpose . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the use of a charged exciton state @xmath112 where there is no dark path  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the use of resonant and coherent laser excitation  @xcite which automatically selects to create bright states not the dark states . ( </S>",
    "<S> iii ) enhancement of the spin relaxation rate  @xcite to suppress the unwanted multiple photon emission . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) selection of qds with a large biexciton binding energy  @xcite in order to limit the spectral overlap of cascaded photons . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) the use of a spectral filter to further reduce the unwanted output from xx emission can partly reduce the impact of the dark path if the filter bandwidth were optimally selected  @xcite .    _ </S>",
