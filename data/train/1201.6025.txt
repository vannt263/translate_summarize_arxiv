    "the high selectivity of hybridisation of dna makes it an interesting molecule to be used as `` smart glue '' in the self - assembly of complex , nano - structured materials .",
    "some of the advantages of dna as a selective linker are that it can code for a large variety of specific linkages , it is readily available , it can be used under near ambient conditions and the binding process is reversible .",
    "consequently , applications of dna - mediated self - assembly range from computational biology @xcite and the assembly of scaffolded `` dna - origami '' structures @xcite to the development of targeting strategies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "much experimental work has focused on the application of dna as a selective linker that enables the self - assembly of complex colloidal structures  @xcite .",
    "several examples have been reported in the literature of ( relatively simple ) dna - linked colloidal crystals , either consisting of nano colloids ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or of micron  size colloids with complementary dna coating ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in parallel ,",
    "theoretical investigations have provided insight into the factors that influence dna - mediated self - assembly  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some disadvantages associated with the use of dna as a tool to link ( nano)colloids . in particular , the very factors that lead to the specificity and reversibility of dna linkages also cause the strength of dna mediated interactions to depend strongly on the external conditions , such as the temperature or ionic strength @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity results in an abrupt onset of aggregation as the temperature is lowered - a phenomenon that can be problematic for self - assembly because it narrows the `` window '' of conditions within which reversible self - assembly of ordered structures is possible .",
    "if this window is missed , self - assembly either does not take place at all or results only in disordered aggregates .",
    "it is therefore important to explore possible approaches to combine the high selectivity of dna - mediated interactions with a more gradual response to external conditions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that ` competing ' dna interactions can be used to create colloidal systems with a more gradual temperature response .",
    "specifically , we consider a binary mixture of colloids ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) that , unlike most systems studied so far , are functionalised by a mixture of different dna strands ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "these dna sequences are chosen such that @xmath4 can bind to both @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( and similarly @xmath5 to @xmath4 and @xmath7 ) , but @xmath7 can not bind to @xmath6 ( we will show that such dna sequences can be readily designed ) .",
    "importantly , the @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath5@xmath7 linkages are weaker than those between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as a result",
    ", @xmath4@xmath5 can form at a higher temperature than the linkages involving @xmath7 or @xmath6 . however , whereas a given @xmath4 , @xmath5 pair can form only one @xmath4@xmath5 linkage , it can form two weaker linkages ( @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath5@xmath7 ) .",
    "this leads to a competition between the different types of linkages in which both their free energy of formation and combinatorial entropy effects , which depend on the number of different ways in which the linkages can form , play a role - as is characteristic for systems with multivalent binding @xcite . here , we investigate how the majority of the linkages can switch from one type to the other , not only as a function of the temperature and the difference in binding strength of the two linkage types , but also as a function of the surface coverage and length ratio of the dna constructs .",

    ".  [ secres ] reports our results . in sec .",
    "[ seccl ] we consider the symmetric model , in which the length of the competing dna constructs is the same ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "here we focus on the interaction between two parallel , planar surfaces .",
    "the pair potential between spherical colloids ( of radius @xmath21 ) can be computed from these planar surface interactions via the derjaguin approximation  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that this is a reliable approximation when @xmath22 . from geometry , it further follows that the interactions are strictly pairwise additive if @xmath23 , assuming that the hard cores of the particles can come into contact . for smaller particles , curvature and so - called three - body effects may cause deviations of the exact interactions from what is predicted here",
    "nevertheless , we expect that bond switching can also occur in these systems , albeit at different values for the relevant parameters .    in the simulations , we consider two square planes with side @xmath24 and periodic boundary conditions in the directions parallel to the planes .",

    "the hybridisation of pairs of ssdna depends on the specific nucleotide sequences of the individual strands and on the solvent properties ( temperature and salt concentration ) . for the present paper",
    "it is important that ssdna sequences can be designed in such a way that only the following linkages are possible : @xmath4@xmath5 , but also @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath5@xmath7 ( see fig .  [ figsys]_a _ and _ b _ ) . in sec .",

    "we have demonstrated that a bond switching transition is possible : upon decreasing the temperature the first linkages to appear are the strongest @xmath4@xmath5 ones while at lower temperatures the system can gain free energy by replacing @xmath4@xmath5 with @xmath4@xmath6+@xmath5@xmath7 . for symmetric systems ( in which the length of the dna constructs is equal ) ,",
    "the bond switching is energetically driven .",
    "this means that the hybridisation free energy of having two weaker linkages is lower than the hybridisation free energy of a single strong one . when choosing the length of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 linkers shorter than @xmath7 and @xmath6 ( asymmetric model ) the bond switching transition is enhanced and occurs at higher temperatures than in the symmetric case . here",
    "the transition is driven by the combinatorial entropy gain related to the fact that an @xmath4 strand , for instance , can bind more @xmath6 than @xmath5 .",
    "the main effect of the competing dna linkages is that the resulting effective inter - colloid pair potential is less strongly temperature dependent than is observed in the conventional case where only a single type of linkage is possible .",

    "a further advantage of the proposed strategy is that the strong linkages are replaced as temperature is lowered , which could be used in in step  wise assembly schemes .",
