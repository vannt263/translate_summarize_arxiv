    "comet halley has a large number of observed apparitions , and many visual observations have been published in the literature .",
    "ferrn ( 2010)@xcite has published brightness observation of several comets , considering that the envelope of the data describes the behavior of the brightness in time .",
    "several secular light curves show asimmetry . we have developed a model that predicts this asimmetry .",
    "the orientation of the rotation axis explains the asimmetry in the secular light curve ( rondn & ferrn , 2010 ; rondn , 2007)@xcite@xcite .",
    "the importance of studying the secular light curve is that it gives a large amount of physical informations of comet .",
    "by modeling this curve we can explain the behavior of the brightness mathematically and we can predict the physical parameters of the curve .",
    "the first step for modeling the light curve is to calculate the sublimation rate of water .",
    "the equation that describes the vaporization rate of a comet is the energy conservation equation , given by :    @xmath1    where a@xmath2 is the infrared albedo , r@xmath3 sun - comet distance , @xmath4 is the projection factor ( cowan&ahearn , 1979)@xcite , @xmath5 is the steffan bolztmann constant , t is the temperature , z(t ) is the sublimation function , l(t ) is the latent heat function , k is the thermal conductivity constant , z is the layer depth .    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the vapor pressure function , m is the molecular weight , k is the ideal gas constant .",
    "if we know the vapor pressure function and the latent heat function , we can solve for the energy conservation equation(1 ) .",
    "@xmath8    we have modeled the water production rate for comet 1p / halley using the observational data given by ( schleicher , 1998)@xcite , and we have found that when considering an active region of 80 km we can predict the average of the observational data ( fig.1a ) . however , the secular light curve considers the envelope of the data ( ferrin , 2005)@xcite . for this case",
    "we have taken an active region of 180 km(fig.1b ) . in both cases",
    "we have assumed an visual albedo @xmath9 , an infrared albedo @xmath10 and a thermal conductivity k=0 .",
    "the correlation equation between the reduce visual magnitude and the water production rate is known ( jorda , 2008)@xcite and is given by :    @xmath11     + the secular light curve of comet halley is assymetric .",
    "this can be explained through of the orientation of the rotation axis of comet ( rondn , 2007)(rondn & ferrn , 2010)@xcite@xcite .",

    "we can see that before perihelion the model fits the observational data , but after perihelion the fits is not very good .",
    "this behavior is due to the thermal conductivity effect in the nuclear surface that has not been considered in the model . in figure 4",
    "we can see that the surface temperature as a function of the latitude is constant for values of the heliocentric distance near and very far away of perihelion .",
    "this behavior near of perihelion is that the coma of comet tends to stabilize the temperature , while for heliocentric distance very far away perihelion the sun radiation is small and therefore the whole cometary nucleus cools .",
