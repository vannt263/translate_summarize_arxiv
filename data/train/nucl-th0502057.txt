    "a large number of models have been developed to get insight into the spectroscopic properties of nuclei .",
    "two of the most successful models are the spherical shell model and the deformed shell model .",
    "large - scale spherical shell model calculations provide excellent agreement with observed data , but less transparent physics interpretations .",
    "the deformed shell model , on the other hand , is a mean field approach that is more illustrative but gives a less accurate agreement with data .",
    "a parallel study using the two models allows a better understanding of the underlying nuclear processes . in this paper",
    "we aim at comparing the predictions of the spherical shell model ( sm ) and one version of the deformed shell model , namely , the configuration - dependent cranked nilsson - strutinsky ( cns ) approach .    for nuclei in the mass region @xmath2 - 50 with valence particles occupying @xmath1-shell orbits ,",
    "well - tested shell model calculations are available @xcite .",
    "nuclei in this region show several interesting collective phenomena , such as the existence of rotational bands , backbending of the yrast band , band termination , and the appearance of superdeformed as well as axially asymmetric shapes ( triaxiality ) @xcite .",
    "other interesting features which have been discussed for these nuclei are the role of isoscalar and isovector pairing @xcite , violation of su(3 ) symmetry @xcite , violation of isospin symmetry @xcite , angular momentum dependence of the mirror energy difference @xcite , and jacobi shapes @xcite .",
    "this long , by no means complete list indicates the significant attention that these nuclei received in the last few years .    though both the spherical shell model and the cranked nilsson - strutinsky model provide a microscopic description of a nucleus , they are basically different .",
    "one difference is that the shell model gives a laboratory frame description , while the cns provides a description in the intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "another difference is the model space and the treatment of the nuclear interaction . within the restricted model space of the spherical shell model ,",
    "the residual interaction between the valence particles is completely taken into account .",
    "the deformed shell model uses a virtually unrestricted model space .",
    "however , only specific parts of the nuclear interaction are included , in particular the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of this interaction is made in the mean - field approximation , with the self - consistency condition treated in an approximate way through the strutinsky energy theorem @xcite .",
    "comparison of the two models allows to identify the missing parts of the nuclear interaction as well as correlations beyond the mean field in the deformed shell model on one hand , and the model space limitations in the spherical shell model on the other hand .",
    "the development of the shell model computer code antoine @xcite led to extensive and rather systematic theoretical investigations of nuclear spectroscopy in the lower part of @xmath1 shell @xcite and inspired much experimental work .",
    "the ( unpaired ) cranked nilsson - strutinsky model @xcite has been applied to more or less all nuclei in the periodic table for which high - spin states have been studied .",
    "the model successfully describes terminating rotational bands @xcite , superdeformed bands @xcite and the phenomenon of shape coexistence @xcite .",
    "this model has also been used to describe a few nuclei in the region of the present study .",
    "the interpretation of selected high - spin data in @xmath3cr and @xmath4v was discussed in refs.@xcite , while the odd - odd nuclei 46v and 50mn were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spherical shell model was previously compared to the cns model for some nuclei in the @xmath5 region @xcite , and a striking similarity in the predictions was found . in this paper",
    "we enlarge the scope of comparison between the two types of models to more nuclei and discuss even - even as well as odd-@xmath6 nuclei .",
    "backbending , the role of pairing , and in particular its contribution to the signature splitting are stressed .",
    "we shall concentrate on the @xmath1-shell nuclei close to the @xmath7 line with mass numbers between @xmath8 and 49 . by making a more systematic comparison of the two models , we want to improve our understanding of the deformed mean field model , test its validity for fairly light nuclei , and , in particular , to get a better understanding of the physical picture behind the observed properties in the region .",
    "this allows to assess the reliability of the cns approach in heavier nuclei , where spherical shell model calculations are not feasible at present .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "first , we describe the models in section [ sect - models ] .",
    "predictions of the two models are confronted and compared in section [ sect - results ] .",
    "the paper is summarized in section [ sect - summary ] .",
    "shell model results are calculated using the computer code antoine @xcite .",
    "valence particles , occupying orbits in the full @xmath1 shell , interact via the residual interaction kb3 @xcite . for quadrupole properties , effective charges @xmath9 , @xmath10 are used .",
    "most of the results obtained with a `` full '' interaction have already appeared in the publications by the madrid - strasbourg group ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we will also present `` unpaired calculations '' which , with exception of the nucleus 48cr @xcite , have not been presented before .",
    "cns calculations are performed utilizing the modified oscillator potential and a standard set of parameters @xcite .",
    "the implementation allows to minimize the energy for a fixed configuration at a given value of the total angular momentum with configurations defined as explained in refs .",
    "the total energy is minimized varying three degrees of freedom : two quadrupole parameters , @xmath11 ( deformation ) and @xmath12 ( non - axiality ) , and one hexadecapole parameter , @xmath13 @xcite . all kinds of pairing interactions are neglected in the cns approach .",
    "therefore , the cns results are mainly valid at high spin , and it becomes natural to normalize experimental and calculated energies at some high spin value .",
    "this is contrary to the spherical shell model where the corresponding normalization is generally done at the ground state .",
    "the calculated energies are often plotted with a subtracted rotational reference @xmath14 mev @xcite in order to facilitate reading of figures and to highlight differences relative to this rotational behavior .",
    "the reference corresponds to the rotation - energy of a rigid rotor for a prolate nucleus with a radius constant @xmath15 fm and a deformation @xmath16 .",
    "a translation between the intrinsic frame of reference and the laboratory frame of reference can be obtained using the rotor model , where those two frames can be related , see @xcite .",
    "thus , having values of the quadrupole deformation parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , it is possible to estimate the strength of the @xmath17 transition between two states , @xmath0 , and the spectroscopic quadrupole moment of a state , @xmath18 . and vice versa , using the values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 , the quadrupole deformation of a nucleus can be derived .",
    "formally , this identification is valid only for fixed axially symmetric shapes .    in the cns approach",
    ", we calculate the intrinsic quadrupole moments from proton single - particle wave functions at appropriate equilibrium deformations .",
    "neutrons have no contribution to this moment . since the rotor model assumes axially symmetric shape , while the calculated triaxiality parameter is usually sizeable , we use an approximate relation between the intrinsic moments and laboratory - frame observables @xcite .",
    "if a nucleus has a rather flat energy surface , quantum fluctuations may become important . to show their effect , in a few selected cases we utilize an approximate method @xcite to add the effect of quantum fluctuations on calculated quadrupole properties .",
    "single @xmath19-shell occupation numbers are readily obtained from the shell model wave - function . in the cns calculations ,",
    "the eigenstates are expanded in a stretched basis .",
    "it is however straightforward to make a transformation into a spherical basis and then to add up the fractions of the spherical subshells of the eigenstates at the equilibrium deformations .",
    "the method is outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the shell model includes all kinds of correlations , an important part of which is pairing . to investigate the effect of the pairing interaction , two calculations",
    "are performed : one using the full interaction , and another one using the interaction with the pairing force subtracted .",
    "as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pairing energy is the difference between the energies obtained in those two calculations .",
    "we consider both the isoscalar ( @xmath20 ; @xmath21 @xmath22 ) and the isovector ( @xmath23+@xmath24+@xmath20 ; @xmath25 @xmath26 ) @xmath27 pairing @xcite .",
    "thus three kinds of pairing energy are discussed : @xmath22 pairing energy , which is deduced from the interaction with a subtracted @xmath22 pairing force ; @xmath26 pairing energy , which is deduced from the interaction with a subtracted @xmath26 pairing force ; and the full pairing energy , which is deduced from the interaction with both pairing forces subtracted .",
    "the strengths of the forces are @xcite : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 mev . since the cns approach does not include the pairing interaction , it is reasonable to compare its predictions to the `` unpaired '' energies of the shell model .",
    "we compare the two models for the even - even systems in subsection [ ssect - eenuclei ] , where the nuclei @xmath31ti and 4824cr are discussed . for 48cr ,",
    "the negative - parity band is discussed in addition to the ground - state band . a few selected odd - even nuclei ( namely , 4522ti , 4723v and 4924cr ) are discussed in subsection [ ssect - oenuclei ] .",
    "the nucleus 48cr has a half - filled @xmath32 shell of protons and neutrons , resulting in the largest ground - state deformation in the @xmath32 region .",
    "the yrast band shows an interesting behavior , being rotor - like with a backbend and a well - established termination at @xmath33 .",
    "it has been interpreted as having a triaxial shape @xcite .",
    "the pairing energy along the band as well as quadrupole properties have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , a good example to start this broader comparison between the cns and the shell model .",
    "an exploratory study of 48cr using the cns and the shell model approaches @xcite suggested that the predicted quadrupole properties are similar , although energies are rather different , see fig .",
    "[ fig - cr48eref ] .",
    "( a similar conclusion was reached when using the cranked hartree - fock - bogolyubov method @xcite . )",
    "we continue this comparison particularly emphasizing the role of the pairing interaction . as in previous studies , we concentrate on the yrast positive - parity , even - spin states between @xmath34 and 16 .     pairing ( crosses ) and without both @xmath22 and @xmath26 pairings ( diamonds ) . the calculated cns energies are matched to the excitation energy of the fully aligned 16@xmath35state .",
    ", width=283 ]    since pairing is neglected in the cns calculation , fig.[fig - cr48eref ] also shows energies of two `` unpaired '' shell model calculations .",
    "the change in the excitation energies suggests that the backbending behavior is mainly caused by the @xmath26 pairing ( as pointed out in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite ) , while the @xmath22 pairing is generally smaller and decreases smoothly with spin .",
    "when the cns energies are normalized to match the excitation energy of a fully aligned state at @xmath33 , they fall between the two unpaired shell model energies ; with only the @xmath26 pairing neglected and all pairing neglected completely , respectively .",
    "however , they come much closer to the shell model results without the @xmath26 pairing . a similar behavior was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the shell model and chfb calculations were compared .",
    "there it was attributed to the improper treatment of the proton - neutron pairing by the latter mean - field method @xcite .",
    "we already noted the similarity of the quadrupole properties as described by the two approaches @xcite and will discuss them more below .",
    "here we would like to point out that a more detailed investigation of the results shows that the calculated wave functions are similar as well : the spherical @xmath19-shells are occupied almost identically , see fig .",
    "[ fig - cr48occ ] .",
    "in particular , there is a very good agreement in the occupation of the @xmath32 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 shells , despite the fact that the two models treat the `` model space '' in a different manner , and moreover , pairing is completely neglected in the cns .",
    "the effects of the @xmath26 pairing interaction are visible in the increased occupation of the @xmath38 shell and the decreased occupation of the @xmath32 shell .",
    "this is easily understood in the bcs picture of the @xmath26 pairing .",
    "the pairing causes occupations of the orbitals around the fermi surface to be smeared out , and in 48cr the fermi surface is in the middle of the @xmath32 shell and below the other shells .    the cns predicts a much lower occupation of the @xmath38 shell than the shell model ( 0.06 particles in the ground state as compared to 0.56 particles predicted by the shell model ) .",
    "in addition , some occupation is found outside of the @xmath1 shell .",
    "the contents of excitations beyond the spherical shell model space decreases smoothly with spin from 0.28 particles in the ground state to zero in the band - terminating state .",
    "this agreement in occupation numbers between the two models is remarkable , since partial occupancies of the spherical @xmath19-shells have different origin in the two models .",
    "the two - body interaction between valence particles causes configuration mixing in the shell model . on the other hand ,",
    "the mixing of spherical @xmath19-shells is determined by the deformation and rotation in the cns approach .",
    "equilibrium deformations calculated in the cns model at different spin values are shown in fig .",

    "as we saw in previous subsections , the sum of the @xmath22 and @xmath26 pairing energies calculated in the shell model and shown in fig.[fig - cr49epair ] seems to describe the missing pairing energy in the cns calculation for odd-@xmath6 nuclei quite well , see figs.[fig-45v47creref ] and [ fig - cr49eref ] . when the pairing energy is subtracted from the shell model energies , no backbending is seen , and the two signature bands behave in a similar way .",

    "the pairing energy contribution is , however , shifted by 1 unit of angular momentum .",
    "for example , the amount of pairing in 5/2@xmath55  and 7/2@xmath55  states in 49cr is the same , because there is no difference in the seniorities of protons and neutrons in these two states : @xmath120 , @xmath121 . to gain angular momentum",
    ", one needs to break pairs , and it is energetically favored to do it in a similar way in both signature partners . since the @xmath32 shell is dominant , this similarity is seen in the pairing energy of states with the spins @xmath72 in the signature @xmath91 band and @xmath122 in the signature partner , see fig .",
    "[ fig - t1pairing - actual ] .",
    "the curve that describes the pairing energy contribution to the @xmath59 band is approximately the same as for the @xmath91 band , but is moved to the right by one unit of angular momentum .",

    "the contribution from @xmath123=0 and @xmath123=1 pairing to the signature splitting , @xmath124 , is studied in fig.[fig - pairingsignaturesplit ] for the considered odd - even nuclei .",
    "we also show the experimental signature splitting that is seen to follow the trends of the shell model calculation .",
    "the difference between the experimental signature splitting and the pairing signature splitting comes from rotational coupling , which is well described in unpaired cns calculations .",
    "the signature splitting from the @xmath22 pairing behaves smoothly in a similar way as in the even - even nucleus @xmath42cr ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) , while the irregular behavior comes from the @xmath26 part .",
    "this can be explained to some extent by a trivial shift by one unit of angular momentum between the two signature partners , as was discussed above .",
    "the change of slope of @xmath125 around @xmath126 seen in @xmath4v and around @xmath111 in @xmath127cr causes the radically different rotational behavior observed for these nuclei , namely that one signature band shows a backbending and the other does not .",
    "a comparison was made between the unpaired cranked nilsson - strutinsky model and the spherical shell model .",
    "it was found that quadrupole properties predicted by the two models agree well .",
    "furthermore , the moment of inertia given by the cns is close to that from the shell model when either only the @xmath26 pairing is removed ( even - even nuclei ) or both @xmath26 and @xmath22 pairings are removed ( odd - even nuclei ) .",
    "in general , the shell model gives an excellent description of observed signature splittings .",
    "it was found that the pairing interaction gives a strong contribution to this splitting .",
    "furthermore , the different spin dependence of the pairing energy for the signature partners in 47v and 49cr explains why backbending is observed in one but not in the other signature .",
    "this behavior comes mainly from the @xmath26 pairing but is strengthened by the @xmath22 pairing .",
    "equilibrium deformations calculated in the cns model shows that some nuclei in the region have noticeably non - axial shapes with negative @xmath12-values corresponding to rotation around the intermediate axis .",
    "these deformations can be traced back to contributions from specific orbitals .",
    "the non - axial deformations are supported by the calculated @xmath0 values and spectroscopic quadrupole moments , which agree well with experiment as well as with those predicted by the shell model .",
    "for 44ti and 46ti the contributions from quantum fluctuations around the equilibrium shape lead to an improved agreement with experimental @xmath0 transition strengths .",
    "the negative - parity band in 48cr was discussed .",
    "it has the largest calculated negative @xmath12-values in this region .",
    "it was also noted that the @xmath0 values predicted by the shell model for the unstretched transitions in 49cr have the expected staggering behavior as a sign of triaxiality . from this extended comparative study",
    "we conclude , that the cns model gives an adequate description of the quadrupole nuclear properties as well as the occupation numbers of the spherical @xmath19-shells . furthermore ,",
    "if the pairing energy calculated from the shell model is added to the unpaired cns energies , excellent agreement to experimental energies is obtained .",
    "it would be most interesting to try to include a pairing force in the cns model that mimics the pairing energy calculated in the shell model .",
    "such a model , which might be applied to all regions of nuclei , could naturally be tested on the @xmath1-shell nuclei studied here .",

    "<S> although the nilsson - strutinsky calculation does not include pairing , both the subshell occupation numbers and quadrupole properties are found to be rather similar in the two models . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that `` unpaired '' shell model calculations produce very similar energies as the cns at all spins . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the pairing energy in the description of backbending and signature splitting in odd - mass nuclei is also discussed . </S>"
