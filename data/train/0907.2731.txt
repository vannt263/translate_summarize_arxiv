    "[ fig : residual ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : dif - map ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , which turn into the almost all observed quadrupole component of the released map . from fig .",
    "[ l2l3 ] we can see that the detected ecliptic contamination mostly comes from the map - making process of the official wmap temperature map , the non - zero flagged tod used by the wmap team in their map - making are the secondary source .",
    "it will be very helpful if the wmap team can thoroughly recheck their map - making process to find out where and how the error occurs , because it is difficult to do so for a non - wmap team member .    in this work",
    ", we built a self - consistent software package of map - making from tod and power spectrum estimation from recovered cmb map .",
    "our software successfully passes through a variety of tests . with the tested software we reconstruct new cmb maps from wmap tod , which are significantly different with the official wmap maps .",
    "our map - making process prevent the problem of inconsistency between input tod and reconstructed map : the anomaly structure and high fluctuation observed in the residual tod of official wmap maps disappear in the residual tod of our new maps .",
    "therefore , the new cmb maps are certainly improved by our map - making and more reliable than the wmap release .",
    "the difference between the old and new temperature maps is almost the same with the quadrupole component of the released wmap5 cmb map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) .",
    "being consistent with this , we also see a structure similar to the released wmap5 quadrupole component after smoothing the map of the wmap residual tod ( fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] ) to @xmath68 .",
    "the correlation map of the residuals between input tod and predicted by the released wmap temperature map is also very similar to the quadrupole component observed in the released wmap cmb map .",
    "such phenomenon strongly suggests that , in the wmap5 cmb temperature map , a very large portion of the presently known quadrupole component is actually artificial . as a natural consequence , in our new cmb map the @xmath58 fluctuation falling near the ecliptic plane no longer exists , and",
    "then the quadrupole component is nearly zero .    despite cosmic variance , the anisotropy at the lowest harmonics as inferred from our reprocessed sky maps are likely to be too low to accommodate the standard cosmological parameters . a nearly zero quadrupole component of cmb map places a tight constraint on the nature of the early universe . as well known , the subtended angle of the cosmological horizon at last scattering is only about 1 - 2 degree .",
    "measured cmb power at the large angular scale of lowest moments should reflect the circumstance of the inflation period , e.g. the state of matter and the production of density fluctuations during inflation .",
    "our result indicates that we may catch sight of the very early rigid universe , the primordial density perturbations should be generated in a later stage of inflation .",
    "it is hopeful to study the generation and revolution of density fluctuation through more reliable large scale cmb data and with suitable mathematical tool for data analysis in the future .    besides the ecliptic foreground contamination revealed in this work , we have found other two kinds of systematic distortions in official wmap maps .",
    "one is the galactic foreground contamination .",
    "although the wmap team has paid huge attention to separate the temperature anisotropy of cmb from galactic foreground emission , in released wmap cmb maps we still find notable distortion from hot galactic sources  @xcite : pixels @xmath1 away from the hottest pixels in the galactic plane are on average 12  14 @xmath40 cooler than average pixels .",
    "another one is the no - negligible effect of imbalance wmap observations  @xcite : significant correlation between the map temperature released by the wmap team and the difference in the observation numbers that a pixel is pointed by the satellite s two antennae , the temperature distortion caused by this observational effect is as high as up to @xmath93 .",
    "these two kinds of systematics are also detected in our new maps and should be further inspected and corrected . therefore we believe that there still exist space to improve cmb maps and accuracies of cosmological parameters again by further improving map - making from wmap tod data and removing residual systematic errors in recovered temperature maps .    except the quadrupole component , the power differences between the wmap5 and our low-@xmath81 spectra at other multiple moments ( fig .  [ lowl ] )",
    "are not too large .",
    "the anomalously planar cosmic octopole still remains in our new wmap5 cmb map , and also in the safe - mode map just with a little lower amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ lowl ] and fig .",
    "[ l2l3 ] ) .",
    "however , from our recent analysis , we find that the effect of imbalance wmap observations may contribute to some extent to the observed octopole component in wmap cmb maps , and the real spectrum at @xmath80 might be lower than observed .",
    "it is expected that more reliable low-@xmath81 spectrum can be derived after better understanding and properly correcting systematics in observation and problems in map - making .",
    "a reliable large - scale spectrum will certainly help to understand the early universe .",
    "for example , for the primordial density perturbations , inflation theory predicts the index @xmath94 in the scalar spectrum @xmath95 being nearly unit , @xmath96 , over a very wide range of @xmath5 by virtue of scale invariance : most perturbations exited the horizon with the same amplitude in the brief interval of rapid exponential expansion .",
    "there is now a possibility that a larger @xmath94 at low @xmath81 might be more consistent with the data .",
    "this in turn would mean that quantum fluctuations generated during inflation may no longer be a viable source of super - horizon perturbations without significant modification .",
    "the best fit cosmological parameters of this work shown in table  2 are just preliminary results .",
    "it is interesting that , for nearly all the basic cosmological parameters ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath91 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , both our values and the wmap + bao + sn cosmological parameter values  @xcite are simultaneously higher or lower than the wmap5 alone  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the new cosmological parameters given by us ( although still rough ) match with improved accuracy those of other two different kinds of measurements : the distance measurements from the type ia supernovae ( sn ) and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the distribution of galaxies .",
