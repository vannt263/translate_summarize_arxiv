    "<S> we will consider cooling of the outer regions of neutron stars that are rarefied enough to be transparent to originating neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> strong magnetic fields ( @xmath0 ) can exist in these regions ; moreover , the fields for the class of the neutron stars that are called magnetars can reach @xmath1 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    under these conditions , the main processes of neutrino production are annihilation of an electron - positron pair ( @xmath2 ) , photoproduction of a neutrino pair on the electron ( @xmath3 ) , photon decay ( @xmath4 ) , and two - photon annihilation ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",

    "<S> * 2 . * in this report , we address one of the processes of neutrino emission that is plasmon decay to a neutrino pair mediated by the neutrino electromagnetic moments . as is well known , the plasmon is the photon with a nonzero mass generated by interaction with a medium . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant medium model for the outer region of the neutron star is a degenerate electron gas in a strong magnetic field @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the temperature and chemical potential of the gas , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fermi energy and momentum , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron mass and charge ( we use the units with @xmath15 ) . under the conditions ( [ cond ] ) , electrons occupy only the lowest landau level in the magnetic field with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron concentration , and the effective photon mass is generated which is equal to the plasmon frequency @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 is the fine - structure constant .    </S>",

    "<S> neutrino coupling ( for the dirac neutrino ) is as follows @xcite @xmath21 , we have calculated the luminosity ( the rate of energy losses by a unit volume of a medium ) due to the process @xmath4 through the electromagnetic channel @xmath22 where the effective neutrino magnetic moment @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . * the upper ( relative ) bound on @xmath24 will be found from the following requirement : the luminosity ( [ lum ] ) should be lower than that in a weak channel @xmath25 . </S>",
