    "the distribution of the directing random measure is called the _ de  finetti measure _ or the _ mixing measure_.    this paper examines the _ computable _ probability theory of exchangeable sequences of real - valued random variables .",

    ", we prove that a distribution on @xmath0^\\omega$ ] is computable if and only if its moments are uniformly computable , which may be of independent interest .",
    "a key step in the proof is to describe the de  finetti measure in terms of the moments of a set of random variables derived from the exchangeable sequence .",
    "when the directing random measure is ( almost surely ) continuous , we can show that these moments are computable , which suffices to complete the proof of the main theorem in this case . in the general case",
    ", we give a proof inspired by a randomized algorithm which succeeds with probability one .",
    "these results are formulated in the turing - machine - based bit - model for computation over the reals ( for a general survey , see braverman and cook @xcite ) .",

    "here we use methods from these approaches to transfer a representational result from probability theory to a setting where it can directly transform statistical objects as represented on a computer .",
    "the computable probability measures in the bit - model coincide with those distributions from which we can generate exact samples to arbitrary precision on a computer . as such ,",

    "this is often implemented by modifying the program s internal state directly ( i.e. , using _ mutation _ ) , or via some indirect method such as a state monad .",
    "the classical de  finetti theorem implies that ( for such sequences over the reals ) there is an alternative description in which samples are conditionally independent ( and so could be implemented without non - local communication ) , thereby allowing parallel implementations . but the classical result does not imply that there is a _ program _ which computes the sequence according to this description . even when there is such a program , the classical theorem does not provide a method for finding it .",

    "( ii ) _ implements the plya urn scheme with @xmath328 red balls and @xmath329 black balls ( see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "11.4 ) ) , and so the sequence of return values from my - plya - coin is exchangeable .",
    "( one can see that the sequence is exchangeable by noting that its joint distribution depends only on the number of red and black balls and not on their order . )    because the sequence induced by repeated applications of my - plya - coin is exchangeable , de  finetti s theorem implies that its distribution is equivalent to that induced by i.i.d",
    ".  draws from _ some _ random measure ( in particular , the directing random measure ) . in the case of the plya urn scheme ,",
    "the directing random measure is a random bernoulli whose weight parameter has a beta@xmath327 distribution .",
    "therefore ( sample - beta - coin ) denotes the de  finetti measure of the sequence of repeated applications of my - beta - coin ( and also of your - beta - coin , incidentally ) .",
    "the distributions of the sequences induced by repeated applications of my - beta - coin and my - plya - coin are identical .",
    "however , there is an important difference between these two implementations .",
    "while ( sample - beta - coin ) denotes the de  finetti measure , ( sample - plya - coin ) does not , because my - plya - coin does not denote a fixed distribution : the internal state of the procedure my - plya - coin changes after each iteration , as the sufficient statistics are updated ( using the mutation operator set ! ) .",
    "therefore , each element of the sequence of repeated applications of my - plya - coin is generated from a different distribution . even though the sequence of applications of my - plya - coin has the same distribution as those given by repeated applications of my - beta - coin , the procedure my - plya - coin denotes a probability kernel which depends on the state .",
    "in contrast , my - beta - coin does not modify itself via mutation ; after it is randomly initialized , the value of weight does not change during the execution of the program .",
    "therefore , in each run of the program , my - beta - coin denotes a fixed distribution  a particular bernoulli .",
    "the procedure my - beta - coin is precisely the directing random measure of the beta - bernoulli process produced by repeated applications of my - beta - coin .",
    "an implementation of the computable de  finetti theorem ( theorem  [ cdeftheorem ] ) transforms _ ( ii ) _ into a procedure which does not use mutation and whose application is equivalent in distribution to the evaluation of ( sample - beta - coin ) . in fact , assuming we know that the code generates a binary sequence ( and therefore that the directing random measure will be a random bernoulli ) , we can transform the de  finetti measure into a procedure that does not use mutation and whose application is equivalent in distribution to the evaluation of ( _ beta _",
    "a  b ) .    in the general case , given a program that generates an exchangeable sequence of reals , an implementation of the computable de  finetti proof can generate a mutation - free procedure generated - code such that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ....

    "for example , having sampled the directing random measure , an exchangeable sequence of random variables can be efficiently sampled in parallel without the overhead necessary to communicate sufficient statistics .",
    "the example above involved binary sequences , but the computable de finetti theorem can be used to transform implementations of real exchangeable sequences .",
    "consider the following exchangeable sequence whose combinatorial structure is known as the chinese restaurant process ( see aldous @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath330 be a computable real and let @xmath331 be a computable distribution on @xmath3 . for @xmath243 , each @xmath332 is sampled in turn according to the conditional distribution @xmath333 = \\frac{n}{n+\\alpha } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{x_i } \\,+\\ , \\frac{\\alpha}{n+\\alpha } h.\\ ] ] the sequence @xmath334 is exchangeable and the directing random measure is a dirichlet process with parameter @xmath335 .",
    "given such a program , we can automatically recover the underlying dirichlet process prior , samples from which produce random measures whose discrete structure was characterized by sethuraman s `` stick - breaking construction '' @xcite .",
    "note that the random measure is not produced in the same manner as sethuraman s construction and certainly is not of closed form .",
    "but the resulting mathematical objects have the same structure and distribution .",
    "sequences of random objects other than reals can sometimes be given de finetti - type representations .",
    "for example , the indian buffet process , defined by griffiths and ghahramani @xcite , is the combinatorial process underlying a _ set - valued _",
    "exchangeable sequence that can be written in a way analogous to the plya urn in _",
    "( ii)_. just as the chinese restaurant process gives rise to the dirichlet process , the indian buffet process gives rise to a non - homogeneous beta - bernoulli process .",
    "unlike in the chinese restaurant process example , which was a sequence of random reals , the computable de  finetti theorem is not applicable to exchangeable sequences of random sets .",
    "the directing random measure was identified as a random bernoulli process , whose base measure is a beta process ( see thibaux and jordan @xcite ) .",
    "a non - homogenous bernoulli process is a sequence of independent ( but not necessarily identically distributed ) bernoulli random variables @xmath336 , and the _ bernoulli sequence _ is the random set @xmath337 . for the beta - bernoulli process , the bernoulli sequence is almost surely finite .",
    "a `` stick - breaking construction '' of the beta - bernoulli process given by teh , grr , and ghahramani @xcite is analogous to the code in _ (",
    "i ) _ , but gives only a @xmath338-index for the bernoulli sequence , rather than its canonical index ( see soare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.2 ) ) .",
    "this observation was first noted by roy et  al .",
    "the computability of sampling independent bernoulli sequences of a beta - bernoulli process remains open .",
    "however , an indian buffet process on a _ discrete _ base measure can be classically transformed into an exchangeable sequence of _ integer _ indices ( representing the finite subsets of the discrete support ) .",
    "if we are given such a representation , the computable de  finetti theorem implies the existence of a computable de  finetti measure that gives canonical indices for the sets .",
    "combinatorial structures other than sequences have been given de  finetti - type representational theorems .",
    "for example , an array of random variables is called _ separately _ ( or _ jointly _ ) exchangeable when its distribution is invariant under ( simultaneous ) permutations of the rows and columns and their higher - dimensional analogues .",
    "nearly fifty years after de  finetti s result , aldous @xcite and hoover @xcite showed that the entries of an infinite array satisfying either separate or joint exchangeability are conditionally i.i.d .",
    "these results have been connected with the theory of graph limits by diaconis and janson  @xcite and austin  @xcite by considering the adjacency matrix of an exchangeable random graph .    as in the case of the indian buffet process , structured probabilistic models in machine learning can often be represented in multiple ways , each of which has different advantages ( e.g. , efficient inference procedures , representational simplicity , compositionality , etc . ) .",
    "the infinite relational model of kemp et  al .",
    "@xcite can be viewed as a partially exchangeable array , while the hierarchical stochastic block model built with the mondrian process of roy and teh  @xcite is described using the aldous - hoover representation , making the conditional independence explicit .",
    "if the computable de  finetti theorem could be extended to partially exchangeable settings , it would provide analogous uniform transformations on a wider range of data structures .",
    "+ the research of roy has been supported in part by an nsf graduate research fellowship .",
    "some of the results in this paper were presented at the _ computability in europe _ conference in heidelberg , germany , july 1924 , 2009 , and an extended abstract @xcite was published in the proceedings .",
    "the authors would like to thank nate ackerman , vikash mansinghka , hartley rogers , and the anonymous referees of the extended abstract for helpful comments ."
