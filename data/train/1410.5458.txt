    "parametric representations of structured surfaces like ruled surfaces , surfaces of revolution or swept surfaces are often used in computer graphics , cad / cam , and surface / geometric modelling ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , when working with parametric instead of implicit representations , one must take into account that some information of the geometric object can be missed .",
    "more precisely , the parametrization may not cover the whole object , that is , some part of the object may not be reachable by giving values to the parameters ; for instance , the curve parametrization @xmath0 covers the unit circle with the exception of the point @xmath1 .",
    "a curve parametrization may miss , at most , one point , called the critical point ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "however , a surface parametrization may miss finitely many curves and finitely many points ; this is a consequence of the fact that the image of the parametrization is a constructible set of the surface .",
    "we will refer to the uncovered part as the _ missing set _ of the parametrization .",
    "we observe that the phenomenon described above can be seen as a particular case of the geometric covering problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in the sense that the image of the parametrization is the subset that one guard covers , and the missing set is the inspection location to be covered by other guards .    parametrizations with nonempty missing sets can be a problem in practical applications if there is relevant information outside the covered part .",
    "examples of this claim can be found in @xcite ( for the computation of intersections ) , in @xcite ( for estimating hausdorff distances ) or @xcite ( for the analysis of cross sections ) .",
    "one way to deal with this difficulty is to find parametrizations that do cover the whole object . in the curve case , there are algorithmic methods for that ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the situation for surfaces is much more complicated , and , at least to our knowledge , it is an open problem .",
    "instead , one may use other alternatives .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the authors compute finitely many parametrizations such that their images cover all the surface .",
    "another possibility is to have a precise description of the missing set of the parametrization , or a subset of the surface containing the missing set ; a subset of the surface , containing the missing set and having dimension smaller than 2 , is called a _ critical set_. in this way , for a practical application one can use the parametrization and then decide the existence of relevant points in the critical set .",
    "the last strategy can be approached by using elimination theory techniques ( see @xcite ) . nevertheless , although theoretically possible , the direct use of these techniques produces , in general , huge critical sets and requires solving systems of algebraic equations . as a consequence , the method turns to be inefficient in practice . however , when working with structured surfaces , a preliminary analysis of the structure can help to describe quickly and easily a critical set .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , we show that any rational ruled surface can be parametrized so that the critical set is a line which is easily computable from the parametrization . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the case of surfaces of revolution given by means of a real plane curve parametrization known as a profile .",
    "we prove that a critical set for the real part of a surface of revolution is , in the worst case , the union of a curve ( the mirror curve of the profile curve ) and a circle passing through the critical point of the profile curve ; see table [ tabla ] . as a direct criterion",
    "( see corollary [ cor ] ) , we obtain that any parametrization of a symmetric real curve with at least one polynomial component generates all the real part of the surface of revolution .",
    "as we will see in the subsequent sections this critical set is indeed very simple to compute from the profile curve parametrization .",
    "an additional advantage of our method is that it does not require that the parametrization of the surface is proper ( i.e. injective ) , while the direct application of elimination techniques needs to compute the inverse of the parametrization , and hence requires that the surface parametrization is proper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - results ]",
    "we present the main results of the paper .",
    "the proofs of these results appear in the appendix . in section [ sec - algorithm ]",
    "we outline the algorithmic methods derived from the theoretical results , and we illustrate them by some examples",
    ". future work on the topic is discussed in section [ sec - extensions ] .",
    "the paper ends with a brief conclusion .",
    "computations were performed with the mathematical software maple 18 .",
    "plots were generated with maple and surfer .",
    "let @xmath2 be a curve ( _ profile curve _ ) in the @xmath3-plane parametrized by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are rational functions with real coefficients ; the results presented here are also valid if the coefficients are complex numbers but for simplicity , and because of the interest in applications , we limit the setting to the real case . in addition , we assume that @xmath6 is proper , that is , injective . we observe that every non - proper parametrization can be reparametrized into a proper one ( see for example section 6.1 . in @xcite ) . also let @xmath7 be the surface of revolution generated by rotating @xmath8 around the @xmath9-axis .",
    "we exclude the trivial case where @xmath8 is a line parallel to the @xmath10 axis , in which @xmath7 is a plane .",
    "the classical parametrization of @xmath7 , obtained from @xmath11 , is @xmath12 observe that properness is assumed in the profile parametrization @xmath11 but not in @xmath13 ; see example 2.3 in @xcite for an example where @xmath13 is non - proper and @xmath11 is proper .    in addition , we consider the parametric curve @xmath14 ( called _ mirror curve of @xmath2 _ ) parametrized as @xmath15 .",
    "observe that @xmath16 if and only if @xmath2 symmetric with respect to the @xmath9-axis .",
    "for instance , the parabola @xmath17 is equal to its mirror curve while the cubic @xmath18 is not .",
    "finally , we represent by @xmath19 the circle of radius @xmath20 in the plane @xmath21 centered at @xmath22 , that is , the curve parametrized as @xmath23 observe that @xmath24 is @xmath25 , i.e. the _ cross section circle _ of the surface @xmath7 of revolution passing through @xmath26 .    before , stating our main results , we need to recall the notion of normal ( i.e. surjective ) curve parametrization and critical point , for further details see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we say that a curve parametrization @xmath27 is normal if all points on the curve are reachable by @xmath27 when @xmath28 takes values in the field of the complex numbers .",
    "the theory establishes that a proper curve parametrization can miss at most one point .",
    "this point is called the _ critical point _ , and it can be seen , in the case of real functions , as the limit , when @xmath28 goes to @xmath29 , of the parametrization ; understanding that if this limit does not exist then there is no critical point and the parametrization is normal .",
    "for instance , @xmath30 or @xmath31 are normal , but the circle parametrization @xmath32 has the _ east pole _ @xmath1 as critical point ; indeed , it is not reachable and hence the parametrization is not normal . in this situation ,",
    "we are ready to established our main results ( see the appendix for the formal proof of the results ) .",
    "we describe now a critical set of the real part of @xmath7 that @xmath33 does not cover . for this purpose",
