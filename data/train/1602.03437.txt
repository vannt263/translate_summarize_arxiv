    "the main aim of the heavy ion collision experiments at rhic and lhc have been to understand the qcd phase transition and properties of the created dense quark matter .",
    "measurements at rhic and lhc have shown that the matter produced is a strongly coupled qgp and behaves like an almost perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "another observation made in central collisions of heavy ions is the suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra at large transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "this phenomena of jet quenching indicates that the produced matter is opaque .",
    "therefore , jet quenching can tell us the properties of the created hot dense matter by the energetic partons passing through the medium and is defined by the jet quenching parameter @xmath6 , which is related to another transport coefficient , the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 @xcite . both @xmath0 and @xmath4",
    "have been obtained in quasi - particle models @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio model(njl ) as well .",
    "the phase transition and @xmath6 have been studied in the framework of dynamical holographic qcd model @xcite .",
    "it is found that both @xmath7 and @xmath4 peak around the critical temperature .",
    "this indicates that @xmath6 can characterize the phase transition @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we have used our previous work on @xmath0 to evaluate @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we show that the inverse of @xmath0 is a good representation of the trace anomaly @xmath8 .",
    "in our earlier work the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 was obtained in the framework of kinetic theory and the string percolation @xcite . in the color string percolation model ( cspm )",
    "the relevant parameter is the transverse string density @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of strings , @xmath11 the transverse area of a single string , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the overlap area of the collision , which depends on the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the following expression was obtained for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 where t is the temperature and l is the longitudinal extension of the source @xmath15 1 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the temperature is expressed as @xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 is the average transverse momentum squared of particles produced from a single string .",
    "@xmath19 is the color suppression factor and is related to the percolation density parameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 the connection between @xmath20 and the temperature @xmath22 involves the schwinger mechanism ( sm ) for particle production .",
    "the schwinger distribution for massless particles is expressed in terms of @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24 where the average value of the string tension is @xmath25 .",
    "the tension of the macroscopic cluster fluctuates around its mean value because the chromo - electric field is not constant .",
    "the origin of the string fluctuation is related to the stochastic picture of the qcd vacuum .",
    "since the average value of the color field strength must vanish , it can not be constant but changes randomly from point to point @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations lead to a gaussian distribution of the string tension , which transforms sm into the thermal distribution @xcite @xmath26 with @xmath25 = @xmath27 .",
    "the string percolation density parameter @xmath20 which characterizes the percolation clusters also determines the temperature of the system . in this way at @xmath28 = 1.2 the connectivity percolation transition at @xmath29 models the thermal deconfinement transition .",
    "we adopt the point of view that the experimentally determined universal chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath30 ) is a good measure of the phase transition temperature , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 is calculated at @xmath28 = 1.2 using the @xmath33 = 167.7 @xmath34 2.6 mev @xcite .",

    "the cluster formed by the strings has generally an asymmetric form in the transverse plane and acquires dimensions comparable to the nuclear overlap .",
    "this azimuthal asymmetry is at the origin of the elliptic flow in cspm .",
    "the partons emitted at some point inside the cluster have to pass through the strong color field before appearing on the surface .",
    "the results of the simulation for different harmonics are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data on the @xmath39 and centrality dependencies  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath0 has minimum in the phase transition region in systems like helium , nitrogen , water , and many other substances @xcite .",
    "thus it shows the location of the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons or crossover in qcd .",

    "the relation associates a small ratio of @xmath0 to a large value of @xmath6 . a large amount of theoretical work has been done to extract the jet transport parameter from jet quenching at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "the latest study by the jet collaboration has extracted or calculated @xmath6 from five different approaches to the parton energy loss in a dense medium .",
    "the evolution of bulk medium in the study was given by 2 + 1d or 3 + 1d hydrodynamic models with the initial temperatures of @xmath43 = 346 - 373 mev and @xmath44 = 447 - 486 mev for most central au+au collisions at @xmath45 = 200 gev and pb+pb collisions at @xmath45 = 2.76 tev respectively .",
