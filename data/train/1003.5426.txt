    "in @xcite and in @xcite we gave a quantum algorithm for computing the jones polynomial via a unitary representation of the three - strand artin braid group to the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "in the bracket polynomial version of this representation ( see section 2 of the present paper ) the representations were unitary for certain continuous ranges of choice of the polynomial variable @xmath0 on the unit circle in the complex plane . in this paper",
    "we show that these three - strand representations are a subset of unitary representations of the artin braid group on arbitrary numbers of strands and corresponding continuous ranges of the variable @xmath0 on the unit circle .",
    "these more general representations are in fact generalizations of the ajl representations @xcite that were originally defined at certain roots of unity in the unit circle .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the bracket polynomial model for the jones polynomial , and its relationship with representations of the temperley - leib algebra . in section 3",
    "we review the 3-strand representation . in section 4",
    "we detail diagrammatically the construction of the generalized representation and show how it is related to the 3-strand representation and to the ajl representation . in section 5",
    "we give a diagrammatic proof of the requisite trace formula that is needed to make this representation into a quantum algorithm for computing the jones polynomial .",
    "much remains to be explored in these directions .",
    "the present paper was sparked by our work in @xcite on nmr quantum computing , and there will be a sequel to the present paper @xcite that relates the present work to nmr research .",
    "the bracket polynomial @xcite model for the jones polynomial @xcite is usually described by the expansion @xmath1{b.eps}}}\\rangle = a \\langle { \\raisebox{-0.25\\height}{\\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{d.eps}}}\\rangle + a^{-1}\\langle { \\raisebox{-0.25\\height}{\\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{c.eps}}}\\rangle \\label{kabr}\\ ] ]    and we have    @xmath2    @xmath1{rcurl.eps}}}\\rangle=(-a^{3 } ) \\langle { \\raisebox{-0.25\\height}{\\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{arc.eps}}}\\rangle \\label{kabr}\\ ] ]    @xmath1{lcurl.eps}}}\\rangle=(-a^{-3 } ) \\langle { \\raisebox{-0.25\\height}{\\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{arc.eps}}}\\rangle \\label{kabr}\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     * remark on the three strand representation .",
    "* now look at the special case of a line graph with three nodes and two edges : @xmath3 the only admissible binary sequences are @xmath4 and @xmath5 so the space corresponding to this graph is two dimensional , and it is acted on by @xmath6 with @xmath7 in both cases ( the empty walk terminates in the first node ) and @xmath8 with @xmath9 for @xmath4 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 then we have @xmath12 @xmath13 ( xyz = 101 or 110 ) where @xmath14    if one compares this two dimensional representation of the three strand temperley - lieb algebra and the corresponding braid group representation , with the representation kauffman and lomonaco use in their paper , it is clear that it is the same ( up to the convenient replacement of @xmath15 by @xmath16 ) .",
    "the trace formula of ajl in this case is a variation of the trace formula that kauffman and lomonaco use .",
    "see the next section for a general discussion of the trace .",
    "note that the ajl algorithm as formulated in @xcite does not use the continuous range of angles that are available to the kl algorithm , but our generalization does allow this continuous angular range .",
    "we now treat the trace function on the ajl representation from a diagrammatic point of view .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the representation of the temperley- lieb algebra discussed in the last section .",
    "let @xmath18 for any element @xmath19 of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "we define a trace functional @xmath20 by the formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 as in the previous section , @xmath23 denotes standard matrix trace and @xmath24 denotes the restriction of @xmath25 to walks that end on the node @xmath26 in the graph @xmath27 just as in ajl , since this trace can be used to compute the bracket polynomial of the closure of the braid at our admissible values of @xmath0 on the unit circle , it follows that there is a quantum algorithm for this computation by having the quantum computer evaluate the standard traces @xmath28 each @xmath24 is a unitary matrix , and its trace can be found via the hadamard test .",
    "we will prove that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inclusion of @xmath25 in the corresponding representation of @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the matrix representation of the element @xmath32 in @xmath33 this formula is exactly what is needed to have a markov trace on the corresponding representation of the artin braid group and hence to have a link invariant corresponding to the bracket model @xcite of the jones polynomial . to see this from the diagrammatic point of view , examine figure 3 . in that figure",
    "we have shown the diagrammatic version of the formula @xmath34 at the top of the figure , and we have compared with the corresponding loop count formula that corresponds to bracket polynomial calculation . the trace we define on the representation of the temperley - lieb algebra will agree with the loop counts performed by the bracket expansion on the closure of the braid , when the @xmath35 formula is satisfied . in the figure @xmath36 refers to loop - count and denotes the evaluation of a collection of loops as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of loops in that collection .    finally , figure 4 is a diagrammatic rendering of the proof of the trace formula .",
    "the expansion in the middle of the derivation corresponds to the evaluation of a representation of a temperley - lieb projector as described in the last section , and it takes into account the action of this projector on the bitstrings in the representation . in the middle of the calculation the labels @xmath39 and @xmath40 remind the reader of the bitstring values for which these terms are non - zero . at the end of the calculation ,",
    "the label @xmath26 reminds the reader that these matrices are acting on walks that end on node @xmath26 in the graph .",
    "we have left some of the details to the reader , but the main line of the argument is in figure 4 .",
    "the reader should note that the syntax of this use of the diagrams is explained in the last section .",
    "this completes the proof of the trace formula and hence the proof that this generalization of the ajl algorithm to continuous angular ranges can be used as a quantum algorithm for the jones polynonmial .",
