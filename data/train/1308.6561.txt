    "as follows from observations of neutrino oscillations , there is a good evidence that the individual lepton flavor is not conserved .",
    "explicit calculations of the standard model ( sm ) rates for the charged lepton - flavor violating ( lfv ) transitions indicate that those are tiny  @xcite , well beyond the capabilities of current and currently planned experiments . yet , many models of beyond the standard model ( bsm ) physics do not exclude relatively large rates for such transitions , so experimental and theoretical studies of lfv processes like @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath0 could provide a sensitive test of those bsm schemes .",
    "the language of effective field theory ( eft ) is very useful in the studies of flavor violating processes for several reasons .",
    "first , it allows to probe the new physics ( np ) scale generically , without specifying a particular model of np .",
    "studies of specific models in this framework are equivalent to specifying wilson coefficients of effective operators .",
    "second , eft allows for studies of relative contributions of various operators and may even provide clues as to what experiments need to be done to discriminate among different possible models of new physics  @xcite .",
    "interactions of flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) of leptons with hadrons , either in muon conversion or in tau or meson decays can be described in terms of effective operators of increasing dimension  @xcite . in order to set up an eft calculation",
    ", however , one must first discuss the multitude of scales present in lepton fcnc transitions .",
    "the highest scale , which we denote as @xmath6 , is the scale associated with new physics that generates the fcnc interaction .",
    "there could be many ways to generate the flavor - changing neutral current of leptons , yet , below the scale @xmath6 any heavy new physics particles are integrated out resulting only in a few effective operators  @xcite .",
    "we shall keep track of the leading contribution due to np which , below the scale @xmath6 , is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the second highest scale is the one associated with electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath8 .",
    "the most important scales for this study are the scales associated with heavy quark masses , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in the framework of eft",
    "one must integrate out heavy quarks that are not kinematically accessible at the scale where the experiment takes place , resulting in changes of wilson coefficients of quark and gluon operators .",
    "the relation between all those scales can be done with the help of renormalization group , keeping track of which degrees of freedom are kept and which are integrated out .",
    "we shall list the most important operators for our analysis below .",
    "the lowest dimensional local operators that contribute to lepton - flavor violating transitions without photons in the final state  @xcite have operator dimension 6 .",
    "there are , in general , twelve types of operators that can be constructed , @xmath12 where @xmath6 is a high scale of new physics , and @xmath13 are dimensionless wilson coefficients .",
    "the four fermion operators can be split into three classes which we define according to their dirac structure , ( i ) scalar operators , @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the sm charged lepton ( quark ) .",
    "the scalar operators above are defined below the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in the standard model as they are not invariant under electroweak @xmath17-symmetry .",
    "the proper definition of those operators above ewsb scale should include higgs doublet fields @xmath18 .",
    "the operators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalops ] ) result from the substitution @xmath19 and redefinition of proper wilson coefficients  @xcite to scale out quark or lepton yukawa coupling , which would result in ( dimensionless ) factor of @xmath20 in front of the scalar operators .",
    "these mass factors properly suppress flavor - violating transitions of the first generation of quarks and leptons that are well constrained experimentally .",
    "notice , however , that they are not model - universal .",
    "for example , models with fcnc higgs boson interactions often employ factors of @xmath21 ( so called cheng - sher ansatz  @xcite ) to suppress flavor - changing lepton currents , while generic leptoquark or r - parity violative supersymmetric models do not have any factors of mass , relying on the smallness of coupling constants to suppress those effects @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall absorb all mass factors into the definition of wilson coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "( ii ) vector operators , @xmath22 and ( iii ) tensor operators , @xmath23 all quark flavors need to be considered , but the operator basis needed to describe a particular experiment could include a smaller number of operators .",
    "the low energy experiments such as muon conversion @xmath24 or tau decay @xmath5 have a naturally defined scale of the order of the mass of heavier lepton . in order to write appropriate set of effective operators at that scale",
    "one must integrate out quarks with masses above that scale  @xcite .",
    "the flavor changing lagrangian for the effective vertices with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and two gluon external legs at the energies lower than heavy quarks masses can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the wilson coefficients , and @xmath29 are the effective operators of dimension 7 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is gluon color index , @xmath32 is the one - loop beta function of three flavor qcd with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the number of light quarks ) and @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the gluon strength tensor , and @xmath37 is the dual one . in eq .",
    "we do not include the operators with dimension higher than 7 .",
    "it can be easily seen that there are no other possibilities besides the four operators in eqs .  .",
    "by calculating the loop diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , using the standard methods  @xcite , the coefficients @xmath38 can be expressed through @xmath13 in eq .   as @xmath39 where the coefficients ( see ref .  @xcite for @xmath40 and appendix [ ap : integrals ] ) at the leading order are @xmath41 note , as previously discussed , that while the wilson coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c1])- explicitly contain factors of @xmath42 , in many models the coefficients @xmath13 contain factors of @xmath43 , which we absorbed as part of their definition . also , we do not explicitly write out contributions to wilson coefficients due to possible colored heavy states that are not sm quarks ; those contributions would result in additive modifications of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1])- . also , in this paper , we ignored running of @xmath28 in between different scales .    integrating out heavy particles could also result in higher dimensional gluonic operators , as would happen for vector - like dimension-6 operators .",
    "for instance , a set of operators of dimension 8 can be written as @xmath44 another three operators , @xmath45 could be obtained by substituting left - handed lepton fields with the right - handed ones .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the operators of dimension 7 , leaving analysis of higher - dimensional operator for future work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ch :",
    "conversion ] we reexamine constraints on the wilson coefficients of operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 from @xmath48-@xmath49 conversion data .",
    "we consider constraints on wilson coefficients of operators @xmath50 from tau decays in section  [ ch : taudecays ] . as an example , in section  [ ch : leptoquarks ] we consider how our constraints translate into constraints on couplings of lfv lepton currents with heavy quarks in leptoquark models .",
