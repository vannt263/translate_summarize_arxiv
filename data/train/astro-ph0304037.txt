    "the seyfert - type active galactic nuclei ( agns ) appear to be intrinsically x - ray loud and the variation in their x - ray emission is largely due to different absorbing columns along the respective lines of sight .",
    "the type  1 and type  2 seyferts and the intermediate seyferts ( types 1.5,1.8 , and 1.9 ) , all show a similar form in their intrinsic x - ray emission  a power law with photon index of @xmath13 which can extend up to a few@xmath14 , an fek@xmath0 line at @xmath15 , and a reflection hump in the @xmath16 region . however , the obscured seyferts show a low - energy cut - off of the intrinsic power law due to photoelectric absorption .",
    "the exact energy of the cut - off depends on the depth of the absorption column .",
    "the obscured seyferts also show unabsorbed soft x - ray emission composed of a number of photo - excited emission lines @xcite .",
    "this component is often extended , non - variable and can not be the emission from the accretion disk .",
    "x - ray emission arising from the accretion disks of obscured seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , the broad iron k@xmath0 emission ) provide us with the opportunity to study the geometry and physical conditions in the inner regions surrounding a super massive black hole ( smbh ) , thus helping us in understanding the diversity in the agn characteristics .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 emission is the most prominent ubiquitous feature in the @xmath17 region of the x - ray spectra of agns .",
    "this emission appears to be a general characteristic of agns .",
    "complex iron k@xmath0 emission consisting of multiple components and/or asymmetric profiles arising from neutral and/or ionized iron have been observed from many seyfert  1 galaxies and provide the strongest evidence for the existence of cold material in the central regions of agns .",
    "the broad iron k@xmath0 emission is the key feature in studies of the geometry and nature of the accretion disks around black holes .",
    "the line profile can also be used to infer the schwarzschild or kerr nature of black holes .",
    "while some seyfert  1 galaxies show broad iron k - shell emission , there are only a few seyfert  2 galaxies with broad iron k@xmath0 emission .",
    "this is likely due to the difficulty in detecting the broad wings in the presence of large absorbing columns along our line of sight to a type 2 nucleus .",
    "the narrow - emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) are good targets for study of the iron k@xmath0 emission from the obscured agns .",
    "optically , nelgs are the same as seyfert  2s and show narrow optical emission lines , often with broad wings of h@xmath0 and p@xmath18 which makes them seyfert  1.9 nuclei .",
    "nelgs are bright and variable x - ray sources which were discovered in early x - ray surveys @xcite . in this paper , we present a detailed study of the iron k@xmath0 emission from an obscured seyfert galaxy mcg-5 - 23 - 16 using _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is an s0 galaxy @xcite first discovered in x - rays by @xcite who also found its optical spectrum to be that of a narrow emission - line galaxy at a redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite classified this galaxy as a seyfert  1.9 based on the possible presence of a broad component in h@xmath0 .",
    "mcg-5 - 23 - 16 with a v - magnitude of @xmath20 is one of the brightest seyfert galaxies in hard x - rays and is also one of the few seyferts detected at @xmath21-ray energies @xcite . its @xmath17 flux , measured to be @xmath22 in 1978 @xcite , decreased by a factor of four in 1989 @xcite , and then increased to @xmath23 in 1996 @xcite before decreasing again to @xmath24 in 2001 ( this work ) .",
    "previous x - ray observations of mcg -5 - 23 - 16 showed a highly absorbed x - ray spectrum ( @xmath25,@xcite ) and a strong iron k@xmath0 fluorescence line with equivalent width of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "weaver et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported a complex iron k - shell line profile in an _ asca _ observation of this source .",
    "these authors discovered a narrow core at the systemic velocity of the galaxy and wings to the red and blue sides of this core .",
    "they modeled the line profile with three gaussian having central energies @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , the data could also be modeled with a line profile from an accretion disk , superimposed upon a narrow gaussian profile .",
    "these data have provided some of the best evidence to date for contributions from two distinct regions to the observed iron line profile .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results from the _ xmm - newton _ observations of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ observatory @xcite has three wolter type 1 x - ray telescopes with three european photon imaging cameras ( epics )  one pn @xcite and two mos ccd @xcite cameras as the imaging spectrometers .",

    "xmm - newton _ observed mcg-5 - 23 - 16 twice on 13 may 2001 and 1 december 2001 for 38ks and 25ks , respectively .",
    "the epic pn and mos observations were carried out in the full frame mode using the medium filter . here",
    "we present the data from the pn and mos cameras .",
    "the raw pn and mos events were processed and filtered using the most recent updated calibration database and analysis software ( sas v5.3.3 ) available in december 2002 .",
    "events in the bad pixels file and those adjacent pixels were discarded .",
    "events with pattern 0 - 4 ( single and double ) for the pn and 0 - 12 ( similar to _ asca _ event grades 0 - 4 ) for the mos cameras were selected for both the observations of 2001 .",
    "examination of background light curves extracted from source - free regions showed that both the observations were affected by particle induced flares .",
    "these flares are characterized by strong and rapid variability in the background light curve .",
    "the particle induced events were filtered out by excluding the time periods where the count rate increased by @xmath30 from the quiescent state background rate .",
    "this resulted in net exposure times of 8.5ks and 13.1ks for the pn and mos , respectively for the observation of may 2001 .",
    "the observation of december 2001 was not affected severely by the particle induced flares : the net exposure times are 19.7ks for the pn and mos cameras .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from the final filtered event lists using a circular region of radius @xmath31 centered on the observed position of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 for both the pn and mos cameras .",
    "background spectra were extracted using appropriate annular regions around the observed position of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 .",
    "any source in the background region was masked out .",
    "appropriate response and effective area files for both the pn and mos cameras were created using the sas .",
    "the pn and mos spectra of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 were analyzed using the spectral fitting package xspec v11.2.0 . in order to check for consistency in the spectral calibration of pn and mos cameras , to check for spectral variability and to derive time averaged spectral characteristics of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 ,",
    "we have carried out spectral model fitting ( i ) to the individual pn and mos data sets extracted from each observation , ( ii ) jointly to the pn and mos data sets for each observation , and ( iii ) to the time averaged pn data obtained by combining the two pn data sets from the two observations .",
    "thus , for spectral fitting , we formed nine data sets from the two observations carried out using the three imaging cameras : pn , mos1 , and mos2 .",
    "the nine data sets were first fitted by a simple absorbed power - law model over the entire @xmath32 bandpass .",
    "none of the fits was acceptable e.g. , the power - law fit to the combined pn spectrum resulted in a minimum @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) of @xmath35 for @xmath36 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . to show the significant deviations from a best - fit power law and to determine the true continuum shape , we refitted the absorbed power - law model after excluding the significant features .",
    "for these fits we used the data in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands . in these bands",
    ", agns usually do not show any significant localized feature .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the combined pn data fitted with the absorbed power - law model and the ratio of data to the best - fit model extrapolated to lower and higher energies . as can be seen in fig .  1 , the poor fit is due to the significant features : a soft excess component below @xmath39 , a strong iron k@xmath0 emission line at @xmath40 , and likely excess emission above @xmath41 .",
    "this paper concentrates on the @xmath42 band and the soft x - ray spectrum will be studied in a separate paper using rgs data also .      to characterize the x - ray continuum ,",
    "simple red - shifted power - law models modified by absorption due to an intervening medium at @xmath44 were fitted to the six spectra derived from the two observations with the three epic cameras : pn , mos1 , and mos2 .",
    "these fits were carried out over the @xmath43 band excluding the fek@xmath0 region ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "all the fits resulted in acceptable @xmath33 ; however , the best - fit values of equivalent hydrogen column ( @xmath46 ) were much higher ( @xmath47 for the pn data of december 2001 ) than the galactic column of @xmath48 @xcite . setting the @xmath46 parameter to the galactic value resulted in unacceptable fits for all the data sets , thus implying heavy obscuration .",
    "the excess absorption column was then determined by introducing an additional absorption component at the source redshift and by refitting the power - law model to individual data sets .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the best - fit parameters : excess n_h n@xmath49 , the photon index @xmath50 , and the fit - statistic @xmath34 .",
    "all the errors quoted , here and below , are at the @xmath51 confidence level .",
    "also listed in table  [ tab1 ] are the observed flux in the @xmath43 band and the absorption corrected ( intrinsic ) flux in the same band . as can be seen in table  [ tab1 ] ,",
    "the best - fit parameters n_h n@xmath49and @xmath50 , derived from the data obtained simultaneously with different instruments , are consistent within the errors .",
    "however , the observed flux is found to differ by @xmath52 between epic pn and mos cameras .",
    "this discrepancy is not unusual for x - ray instruments in their early phase of calibration .    in order to further constrain the spectral shape ,",
    "the absorbed power - law model was fitted to the pn and mos spectra jointly .",
    "the relative normalizations for the different instruments were kept free allowing for the small difference in the calibrated absolute flux , and any differences in the fraction of encircled counts contained in the pn and mos extraction cells .",
    "the results of these fits are also listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "there are small variations in the best - fit spectral parameters between the two observations : @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; @xmath55 .",
    "the source became harder and fainter in dec .",
    "2001 .    to determine the average continuum shape , we fitted the absorbed and red - shifted power - law model to the time averaged pn data obtained by combining the two pn data sets from the two observations .",
    "the time averaged photon index is @xmath56 and the observed flux in the @xmath43 band is @xmath57 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the ratio of the pn spectrum extracted from the december 2001 observation to the best - fit power law derived by using the data in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands as described in the preceding section ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this plot clearly reveals a broad emission feature in the @xmath58 band and peaking at @xmath15 . this feature is common among seyfert galaxies and",
    "is attributed to the fluorescence emission from the iron k - shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fek@xmath0 emission of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 appears to be nearly symmetric in its red and blue wings and is clearly different in shape from the red - shifted and asymmetric fek@xmath0 profiles generally observed from seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "2 also suggests the likely presence of an iron k - edge at @xmath4 . to measure the strength and shape of the fek@xmath0 emission , we parameterize the observed profile in terms of simple gaussian models . for this analysis ,",
    "the co - added pn data were used , as the pn has the largest effective area among the three epic cameras .",
    "hence the derived parameters characterize the time averaged fek@xmath0 profile .",
    "initially , a narrow unresolved gaussian ( @xmath59 ) was used for the fek@xmath0 emission and the absorbed and red - shifted power - law model was used for the continuum as described in section  [ continuum ] ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this model resulted in a poor fit with @xmath34 of 262 for 235 dof .",
    "the ratio of the data to the best - fit narrow gaussian model is plotted in figure  [ f3 ] ( second panel from the top ) which shows a dip at @xmath15 and excess counts on the red and blue sides of the dip .",

    "the width of the gaussian improved the fit significantly ( @xmath60 for 1 additional parameter ) .",
    "this suggests that the line may be broad .",
    "addition of a narrow gaussian component ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath15 improves the fit significantly ( ( @xmath61 for two additional parameters ) .",

    "the width of the broad iron k@xmath0 line observed from mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is too large to be produced in regions other than the accretion disk around a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "therefore we checked whether the observed profile is consistent with a relativistic disk - line model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes a schwarzschild geometry and the disk emissivity is a power - law function of disk radius r i.e. @xmath66 .",

    "the ratio of the data and the best - fit model is plotted in figure  f4 ( top panel ) .",

    ", the compton reflection emission can be important even below @xmath89 ( see section  [ orig_feka ] ) .",
    "if the onset of the reflection component is at @xmath90 , the presence of a strong fe  k - shell edge at @xmath91 may artificially mimic a broad emission line feature at @xmath40 .",

    "this flatter spectrum and strong iron k@xmath0 line of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 could then be partly due to the contribution of a compton reflection process in a geometry where the primary x - ray source is partially covered by cold matter e.g. a torus .",
    "the reflection emission has been detected from mcg-5 - 23 - 16 with _",

    ", we have fitted a compton reflection model to the combined pn data in the @xmath42 band .",
    "we used the reflection model `` pexrav '' @xcite available with xspec .",
    "this model calculates the reflected spectrum from a neutral disk exposed to an exponentially cut - off power - law spectrum @xcite . since _",
    "xmm - newton _ does not cover the expected peak ( @xmath94 ) of the reflection component , it is not possible to constrain all the parameters of the reflection model using _ xmm - newton _ data alone .",
    "instead we fix the cut - off energy of the primary power - law at @xmath95 , disk inclination at @xmath96 , and the abundance of heavy elements at the solar value .",

    "the relative normalization of the reflection emission derived from the pn data is much higher than the value of @xmath104 inferred from the _ bepposax _ observations of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 @xcite .",

    "such a large discrepancy in the reflection emission inferred from the pn and bepposax data could be due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "this view is supported by mos data , albeit lower signal - to - noise , which do not show a clear excess emission above @xmath41 .    to test the reliability of the excess emission above @xmath41 in the _ xmm - newton _ pn data",

    "the source spectrum was extracted from an annular region with inner and outer radii of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively and centered at the observed source position . due to the high flux of mkn  421 , the events from the core of the point spread function",

    "is not expected to show any excess emission , we conclude that the excess emission over the power - law seen above @xmath105 in the spectra of mkn  421 and mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is likely an artifact and reflects poor spectral calibration of the pn above @xmath41 .",
    "lack of any significant feature in the @xmath43 band of the mkn  421 pn spectrum suggests that the spectral calibration of pn in that energy band is indeed good and the presence of a broad iron k@xmath0 emission is not an artifact .",
    "we refitted the compton reflection model to the combined pn data after excluding the data above @xmath41 .",
    "we utilized the best - fit parameters for the reflection component derived from the _ bepposax _ observations by @xcite and fixed the cut - off energy @xmath111 at @xmath112 and relative normalization @xmath97 at @xmath113 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab4 ] .",

    "such narrow components are naturally expected from the torus and/or the broad line region in the framework of the unification model of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the maximum equivalent width of an fek@xmath0 line produced by fluorescence in a cold reflector far from the disk with @xmath123 is @xmath124 in the case of ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "thus the observed equivalent width of the narrow iron f@xmath0 line of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is consistent with that expected from the torus .",
    "the broad component has an fwhm of @xmath125 and an equivalent width of @xmath126 .",
    "this component is described by a broad gaussian or relativistic disk - line arising from an accretion disk around a schwarzschild or kerr black hole suggesting that the line profile is not strongly modified by gravitational effects but broadened by the doppler effect in a rotating disk .",
    "the disk - line fits imply that the disk is neutral and the disk - normal is inclined at an angle of @xmath127 .",
    "the likely presence of an absorption edge at @xmath91 ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) also suggests that the disk is neutral .",
    "the best - fit values of the emissivity indices inferred from the disk - line fits ( in schwarzschild and kerr geometry ) are similar but lower than the average value of @xmath128 obtained for seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that nandra et al . had also fixed the inner radii to @xmath67 ( schwarzschild black hole ) and @xmath80 ( kerr black hole ) .",
    "@xcite inferred @xmath71 to be in the range of @xmath129 but allowed @xmath130 to vary with the best - fit values in the range @xmath131 .",
    "these results imply that if the emissivity law for mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is the same as that of an average seyfert  1 galaxy , then the inner radius of the accretion disk is larger for mcg-5 - 23 - 16 .",
    "our spectral fits suggest that the @xmath43 continuum has flattened from @xmath132 ( may 2001 ) to @xmath133 ( december 2001 ) and the broad component of the iron k@xmath0 line has weakened from an equivalent width of @xmath134 ( may 2001 ) to @xmath135 ( december 2001 ) . in the _ asca _ observations of may 1991 ,",
    "the photon index and the equivalent width of the broad component of the iron k@xmath0 line were found to be @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "these results suggest weakening of the broad iron k@xmath0 line with flattening of the x - ray continuum .",
    "higher equivalent widths of the iron k@xmath0 emission could be produced by an increased abundance of iron or by increasing the reflection component .",
    "it is unlikely that the change in the equivalent width of iron k@xmath0 is due to a change in the iron abundance due to the following reasons : ( @xmath70 ) it is very unlikely that iron abundance changes by a factor of about two in just six months , and ( @xmath138 ) it is difficult to explain the variation in the shape of the non - thermal x - ray continuum by changing the iron abundance .",
    "increasing the reflection emission from a neutral disk may flatten the continuum .",
    "this will require a change in the geometry of the accretion disk - corona system ( e.g. increasing the covering factor at the corona will result in more reflection emission ) .",
    "however , this will increase the equivalent width of the iron k@xmath0 line with flattening of the continuum .",
    "large equivalent widths of fek@xmath0 can be produced if the accretion disk is ionized @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a correlation between the shape of the x - ray spectrum and the energy of the fek@xmath0 line among radio - quiet type  1 agns and suggested that the accretion disks of agns with steeper continua are more ionized .",
    "the trend in @xmath50 and the equivalent width of iron k@xmath0 emission from mcg-5 - 23 - 16 could be understood if the shape of the x - ray continuum is coupled with the ionization stage of the disk material in mcg-5 - 23 - 16 in a similar way to that observed among the radio - quiet agns .      as shown in section  [ analysis ] , the broad feature at @xmath74 can be modeled as a broad gaussian ( fwhm@xmath2 ) or a line profile arising from an accretion disk around a schwarzschild or a kerr black hole .",
    "alternatively , most of the flux in the broad component can also be accounted by reflection emission .",
    "however , the derived reflection fraction ( @xmath5 ) is much larger than that inferred from the _ bepposax _ observations of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 ( @xmath139 ; @xcite ) and the average value for seyfert  1 galaxies ( @xmath140 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is not entirely impossible if the reflector is a putative torus far away from the central continuum source .",
    "the reflection fraction can be large if the central source was brighter before a time period which is equal to the time delay between the reflected and primary x - ray emission .",
    "however , such a large reflection fraction for mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is unlikely due to the following reasons  ( i ) the calibration of the epic pn above @xmath41 is reliable at a level of @xmath106 ( snowden , private communication ) .",
    "mos data do not show clear excess emission above @xmath41 as is the case for pn .",
    "( ii ) the broad feature at @xmath15 weakens with flattening of the continuum .",
    "this is not expected if the broad feature were the reflection emission .",
    "simultaneous observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ would be crucial to characterize both the fek@xmath0 emission and reflection component .      _ xmm - newton _ observations of december 2001 have revealed the presence of an iron k - shell absorption edge near @xmath91 .",
    "however , the edge is not well constrained and is detected only at a significance level of @xmath141 .",
    "the edge energy is not well determined but it appears to be @xmath91 ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the optical depth is found to be @xmath142 .",
    "assuming that the edge arises due to the k - shell absorption of neutral iron and the corresponding photoionization cross section ( @xmath143 ; @xcite ) , we determine the column density of neutral iron to be @xmath144 .",
    "this corresponds to an effective hydrogen column density of @xmath145 , which is a factor of two higher than the hydrogen column density derived by fitting an absorbed power - law model to the observed data .",
    "given the uncertainty in the derived value of the optical depth , it can not be ruled out that the fe k - edge arises entirely in the absorbing material along our line of sight in the form of a putative torus .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether both the absorption k - edge and the narrow component of the k@xmath0 line due to iron could be produced in the the putative torus around an accretion disk . in the case of isotropic emission ,",
    "the equivalent width of the emission line should be @xmath146 . for a typical covering factor @xmath147 for the torus and solar abundances ( @xmath148 ) , the absorption column required to produce an equivalent width of @xmath149 for the narrow iron k@xmath0 line is @xmath150 .",
    "this column is larger by a factor of five than the absorption column derived from the power - law fit .",
    "it is also larger by about a factor of three than the absorption column derived from the iron k - edge , since the absorption features are produced only by a column along our line of sight while the emission features are spatially integrated in the case of a source which is unresolved .",
    "the above results imply that we are viewing the outer edge of a putative torus where the column density is lower than the inner regions of the torus .",
    "this is consistent with that expected for a seyfert  1.9 galaxy from the unification scheme @xcite .",
    "we studied the @xmath43 spectrum of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 which was observed twice with _ xmm - newton _ in may and december 2001 .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line profile of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 is broad and nearly symmetric .",
    "the observed profile could be modeled by a combination of a narrow ( unresolved ) and a broad gaussian component .",
    "the broad component is also consistent with that expected from an accretion disk around a schwarzschild or a kerr black hole .",
    "the disk inclination angle of @xmath151 , inferred from the disk - line fits , is consistent with that expected for a seyfert  1.9 galaxy according to the seyfert unification picture .",
    "3 .   alternatively ,",
    "most of the flux of the broad feature at @xmath74 can also be modeled as the reflection emission , however , the reflection fraction ( @xmath152 ) is much larger than that derived from the _ bepposax _ observations ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "this is likely to be due to uncertainty in the calibration of epic pn above @xmath41 .",
    "we have derived three values of absorption column ( @xmath70 ) @xmath10 from the best - fit absorbed and red shifted power - law model , ( @xmath138 ) @xmath153 from the absorption edge , and ( @xmath154 ) @xmath155 required to produce the narrow iron k@xmath0 line emission .",
    "the above three values are consistent with a geometrical picture in which our line of sight passes through the outer edges of a putative cold torus obscuring the nuclear x - ray source as expected for a seyfert  1.9 galaxy from the unification scheme .",
    "5 .   the broad iron k@xmath0 emission appears to weaken with the flattening of the x - ray continuum .",
    "this can be understood if the degree of ionization of iron in the accretion disk decreases with flattening in the x - ray spectrum . however , in any case the disk does not appear to be highly ionized ( i.e. hydrogen or helium - like iron ) .",
