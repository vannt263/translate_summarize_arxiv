    "<S> the plasmon spectrum consists of one optical excitation with a square - root dispersion and @xmath1 acoustical excitations with linear dispersions , which are undamped at zero temperature within a triangular energy region outside the electron - hole continuum . for any finite number of graphene layers we have found that the energy and weight of the optical plasmon increase in the long wavelength limit , respectively , as square - root and linear functions of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with recent experimental findings . with an increase of the number of multilayer acoustical plasmon modes , </S>",
    "<S> the energy and weight of the upper lying branches also exhibit an enhancement with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is strongest for the uppermost acoustical mode so that its energy can exceed at some value of momentum the plasmon energy in an individual graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the energy of the low lying acoustical branches decreases weakly with @xmath0 as compared with the single acoustical mode in double - layer graphene structures . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculations provide a detailed understanding of the overall behavior of the wave vector dependence of the optical and acoustical multilayer plasmon modes and show how their dispersion and damping are modified as a function of temperature , interlayer spacing , and inlayer carrier density in ( un)balanced graphene multilayer structures . </S>"
