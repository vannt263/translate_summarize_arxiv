    "it has been well known that the helium ii partial ionization zone drives the radial pulsation of cepheids and rr lyraes via the @xmath7-mechanism . in between this zone and the photosphere , defined as a layer with an optical depth of @xmath8 , there exists another partial ionization zone  the hydrogen ionization front ( hif ) . during the cycle of pulsation",
    ", the hif will move `` in - and - out '' within the mass distribution .",
    "furthermore , the relative positions of the hif and stellar photosphere change with the pulsation phase . hence , it is possible that hif will interact with the photosphere at certain phases of the pulsation , where the photosphere is located at the base of the hif .",
    "this has been demonstrated with a series of pulsation models constructed , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "results based on these calculations suggested that this interaction will occur at maximum and and minimum light for cepheids and rr lyraes , respectively .",
    "the period - color ( hereafter pc ) and amplitude - color ( hereafter ac ) relations at maximum and minimum light can be used as diagnostics of such interactions for cepheids and rr lyraes .",
    "for instance , the interaction of hif with the photosphere at certain pulsation phases would imply that the observed pc relation will be flat or very shallow ( that is , the slope of the pc relation is close to zero ) at these phases ( for a thorough discussion on this , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the case of cepheids ,",
    "the pc and ac relations have been extensively studied in a series of papers @xcite , as well as in @xcite . for rr lyraes , @xcite investigated the pc and ac relations based on @xmath9 rr lyraes in large magellanic cloud obtained from the macho project , and found that the pc and ac relations at minimum light have a slope close to zero for this set of rr lyraes .",
    "a similar result was also found with the fundamental mode rr lyraes in the large and small magellanic cloud using the optical gravitational lensing experiment iii ( ogle - iii ) data @xcite .",
    "note that the flatness of the rr lyraes pc relation at minimum light provides an alternate approach to estimate the reddening@xcite .",

    "in contrast , the sdss data enables our investigation of pc and ac relations in multi - colors .",
    "preliminary results of this work can be found in @xcite , and the main purpose of this paper is to present the final results based on the full analysis of the sdss stripe 82 rr lyrae data .",

    "the @xmath2 band photometric light - curve data for rr lyraes in the sdss stripe 82 region was adopted from @xcite , who found 483 rr lyrae based on observations that spanned from 1998 september to 2007 november .",
    "median numbers of data points per light curve are 55 and 56 in @xmath11 bands and @xmath12 bands , respectively .",
    "further details regarding this dataset can be found in @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "this set of rr lyraes includes @xmath13 fundamental mode rrab stars and @xmath14 first overtone rrc stars .",
    "in addition to the light - curve data , @xcite also provided the @xmath2 band template light curves for rr lyraes .",
    "we adopted these template light curves to derive the amplitudes and colors at maximum and minimum light for each rr lyrae in the sample as described further below .    in the first step ,",
    "each of the light curves is converted to a phased light curve according to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pulsation period as given in @xcite and the function @xmath17 takes the integer part of the argument .",
    "the template light curves in a given band were then fitted to the phased light curves by determining the mean magnitudes , amplitudes , and the phase difference between the template and phased light curves .",
    "the @xcite simplex minimization algorithm , implemented within the gnu scientific library , was employed to perform the fitting .",

    "we use this definition rather than the difference between the brightest and faintest observed points , in order to prevent amplitudes being effected by outliers . in other words , the sdss colors @xmath20 at maximum light , where @xmath21 , were determined from the same phase when the @xmath19 band is at maximum light .",
    "the same procedure was applied to determine the sdss colors at minimum light .",
    "we emphasize that the colors at maximum light and minimum light were _ not _ based on the extreme values in a given light curve . at maximum light",
    "is not same as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the maximum light for light curve in bandpass @xmath24 . ]",
    "the main reason to select the @xmath19-band light curve as the reference light curve for determining these two extreme phases is because at typical rr lyrae effective temperatures ( around @xmath25k to @xmath26k ) , wien s displacement law suggests that the wavelengths at which the black - body curve peaks will fall within the @xmath19-band transmission curve .",
    "for the same reason amplitudes of these rr lyraes will be based on the @xmath19-band fitted template light curves .",
    "taking a reference band in this way and computing the colors at maximum and minimum light with respect to the reference band will preserve the phase differences in light curves at different wavebands .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents examples of the fitted @xmath2 band template light curves to randomly selected rr lyraes in our sample .",
    "we visually examined all fitted light curves and removed those rr lyraes that met either one of the following conditions : ( a ) light curves that show evidence of blazhko or amplitude modulation , rrab and @xmath27 rrc stars display evidence of blazhko modulation .",
    "this is about 11% of the sample studied here .",
    "however , a detailed study to confirm or falsify the blazhko nature of these rr lyraes is beyond the scope of this work . ] and/or ( b ) light curves that do not exhibit well - defined colors at maximum and minimum light .",
    "our philosophy is governed by selecting a subset of well - fitted light curves , such as those presented in figure [ fig1 ] , rather than including data that do not have well - determined colors at maximum and minimum light .",
    "after visual inspection , 312 and 86 rr lyraes of @xmath28- and @xmath29-types were left in our sample , respectively .",
    "extinction corrections were determined using the @xmath30-band extinction values ( @xmath31 ) given in @xcite ; extinctions in other bands were scaled with the following relations : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is well known that the rrab stars in globular clusters exhibit the so - called oosterhoff dichotomy ( for examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the oosterhoff type i and ii ( hereafter ooi and ooii , respectively ) can be distinguished via the period - amplitude ( or bailey ) diagram ( for examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "before investigating the pc and ac relations for these rr lyrae in the next section , we further divided our rrab stars into the ooi and ooii types by using the criterion suggested in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_pamp ] displays the period - amplitude diagram and the classified ooi ( @xmath36 ) and ooii ( @xmath37 ) rrab stars .",
    "table [ tab1 ] presents the @xmath19-band amplitudes and the colors at maximum and minimum light for our rr lyrae sample .",
    "the corresponding plots of the pc and ac relations are displayed in figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] and [ fig_acmaxmin ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss our analysis and results on these relations further in the following subsections .",
    "the observed pc relations were also compared to the synthetic colors in figure [ fig_vscc2008 ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found a significant non - zero and positive slope for the pc relation at maximum light in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 colors , respectively . in the left panel of figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] we plotted the pc relations at maximum light for rrab and rrc stars : these display a variety of behavior .",
    "for example , we found significantly positive slopes for fundamental mode rrab stars for all colors , confirming the results presented in earlier work , except in @xmath3 color .",
    "the @xmath3 behavior at maximum light is more complicated .",
    "the rrab stars appeared to exhibit a flat relation with this becoming negative for the ooii rrab stars . in the case of first overtone rrc stars , shown as red crosses in figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ]",
    ", the @xmath3 pc slope is negative and a slight positive slope for all other colors .",
    "the negative pc slopes in the @xmath3 color and positive pc slopes in other longer wavelength colors could be understood due to the bolometric corrections when transforming the physical quantities ( luminosity and effective temperature ) , to observable quantities such as magnitudes and colors @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig_vscc2008 ] compares the observed colors at maximum light , i.e. those from left panel of figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] , to the synthetic colors derived using the relations given in @xcite , which demonstrates that the trends of the pc relations are very similar in both cases .",
    "figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] also reveals that the pc relations at maximum light for rrab stars , especially in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors , can be split into two sequences that belong to ooi and ooii rrab stars , respectively ( note that rrc stars do not split into two sequences in figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] ) .",
    "therefore , regressions on the pc relations were fitted separately to the ooi and ooii rrab stars .",
    "we first fit a linear regression to the pc relations at maximum light , and the fitted parameters are listed in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in table [ tab_pc_maxmin ] .",
    "we then applied a standard @xmath38-test to see if the slope ( @xmath39 ) from the linear regression is consistent with zero or not , with null and alternate hypothesis as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . by adopting a confidence level at @xmath42",
    ", the null hypothesis can be rejected if the @xmath43-value , @xmath44 , is smaller than 0.05 .",
    "the @xmath38-test results given in table [ tab_pc_maxmin ] show that @xmath45 for all pc relations at maximum light .",
    "hence , these pc relations exhibit a significant slope from the linear regression , regardless of the type of rr lyrae ( ooi rrab , ooii rrab , or rrc ) .",
    "in addition , the linear slopes are different in each sdss color between the ooi rrab , ooii rrab , and rrc stars .    inspecting the left panel of figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] suggests that the pc relation at maximum light for rrab stars might not be linear , especially in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 colors .",
    "we therefore fitted a quadratic regression to the pc relation at maximum light ; the fitted parameters are summarized in columns ( 7)-(9 ) in table [ tab_pc_maxmin ] .",
    "dispersions ( @xmath46 ) from the fitted regressions , listed in columns ( 4 ) and ( 10 ) of table [ fig_pcmaxmin ] , might not be a good metric to decide whether linear or quadratic regressions are better fits to the data , as the dispersions show marginal or no improvement when moving from linear to quadratic regressions .",
    "instead , the standard @xmath47-test should be applied to evaluate which regression method is better .",
    "we calculated the @xmath47-value as follows .",
    "@xmath48}{rss_q/(n-3 ) } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is number of data points , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the residual sums of squares for the linear and quadratic regressions , respectively .",
    "we also evaluated the @xmath43-value under the @xmath47-distribution @xmath52 with the null hypothesis that linear regression is sufficient to fit the data .",
    "the alternate hypothesis is that the quadratic regression is needed .",
    "results of the @xmath47-test are given in columns ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) of table [ fig_pcmaxmin ] .",
    "as before , we adopted @xmath42 such that the null hypothesis can be rejected if @xmath53 .    in the case of rrc stars ,",
    "the @xmath47-test provides evidence that a linear regression can be used to fit the pc relation at maximum light in the four sdss colors . for rrab stars",
    ", the @xmath47-test suggested that a quadratic regression is a better model for ooi rrab star in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 colors .",
    "the @xmath6 color , on the other hand , shows a marginal @xmath47-test result .",
    "this behavior is different from the ooii rrab stars because the pc relation at maximum light in @xmath3 color is ( marginally ) nonlinear but linear in the other three colors .",

    "our results presented in table [ tab_pc_maxmin ] confirm the existence of a linear pc relation at minimum light for these type of pulsating stars .    in the case of rrab stars",
    ", the majority of the pc slopes at minimum light , as presented in table [ tab_pc_maxmin ] , do not show a clear evidence of flatness , which is different to what has been found from previous works .",
    "however , we note that in almost all cases except one , the pc slope at minimum light is significantly shallower than the pc slope at maximum light .",
    "the exception is the @xmath3 color for ooi rrab stars . for this dataset ,",
    "combining the @xmath38-test and @xmath47-test results , the pc relations at minimum light for ooi rrab stars are better described with a quadratic regression in the @xmath4 color , but linear in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 colors .",
    "the @xmath38-test result of the @xmath3 pc relation at minimum light of ooi rrab stars suggests a marginal flat relation .",
    "the ooii rrab stars , however , display a flat pc relation at minimum light in the @xmath3 and @xmath6 colors , but a quadratic and linear relation in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors , respectively . finally , we note that trends of the observed pc relations at minimum light are very similar to the pc relation constructed from synthetic colors ( right panel of figure [ fig_vscc2008 ] ) .    at first glance ,",
    "our results on pc relations at minimum light seem to disagree with theoretical expectations @xcite and earlier empirical studies @xcite .",
    "a careful inspection on the right panel of figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] , especially the @xmath4 pc relation , reveals that a flat pc relation could exist if we consider only rrab stars with @xmath263 greater than approximately @xmath264 .",
    "therefore , we applied a period cut at @xmath265 and fitted a linear regression only for those rrab stars with periods greater than this period cut .",
    "this was done separately for ooi and ooii rrab stars .",
    "the slopes of the linear regression as a function of the period cut are displayed in lower panels of each sub - panel in figure [ fig_pccut ] .",
    "we also applied the @xmath38-test on these slopes , and the corresponding @xmath44 values are shown in the upper panels of the sub - figures in the same figure .",
    "our results show that @xmath3 pc relations at minimum light are always flat regardless of period range and oosterhoff type .",
    "the same result is also found for @xmath6 ooii pc relations at minimum light .",
    "for other pc relations at minimum light , a flat relation exists only if we consider rrab stars with periods greater than a given @xmath265 .",
    "for example , we observed a flat @xmath4 pc relation at minimum light for ooi rrab stars with @xmath266 .",
    "as in the case of pc relations , the ac relations presented in figure [ fig_acmaxmin ] were fitted with linear and quadratic regressions and the results are summarized in table [ tab_ac_maxmin ] .",
    "for rrc stars , flat ac relations are found at maximum light in all four colors , even though the @xmath4 ac relation shows a marginal result .",
    "we note that @xcite also found a significantly different ac relation at maximum light in the @xmath1 color for the lmc and smc rrc stars .",
    "these differences can be attributed to the significantly different sample sizes used in this work and also in the lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath5 and @xmath6 colors , temperature fluctuations are expected to have less influence on amplitude variations .",
    "therefore , we do not see a period - amplitude relation for rrc stars in our sample similar to @xcite for @xmath267-band data .",
    "another possible cause of this difference can be the selection of @xmath19-band amplitude as reference for all colors , instead of using amplitude corresponding to the shorter wavelength .",
    "for example , we observe that the slope of the @xmath4 ac relation at maximum light , @xmath209 , is almost identical to the @xmath1 ac relation based on the large magellanic cloud rrc stars ( @xmath268 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it will be interesting to investigate this further with a greater sample in the future , for example , as provided by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) . at minimum light",
    ", significant non - zero slopes were found for the ac relations as in previous work @xcite .",
    "further @xmath47-test results show that the ac relations at minimum light for rrc stars are linear in the @xmath3 and @xmath6 colors , and quadratic in other two colors .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found a significant and flat ( or very shallow ) ac relations at maximum light and minimum light , respectively , for the rrab stars .",
    "our @xmath38-test results confirm these earlier works that the ac relations at maximum light exhibit a non - vanishing slope in all four sdss colors .",
    "this is a consequence of the relation between pc and ac , originally developed in @xcite and later work ( see the introduction ) .",
    "some of these relations are better described by a quadratic regression , such as the @xmath3 and @xmath6 ac relations for ooi rrab stars and @xmath4 ac relation for ooii rrab stars .",
    "flat or very shallow ac relations at minimum light are found for ooii rrab stars except the @xmath4 ac relation .",
    "a marginal flat @xmath3 ac relation at minimum light is also found in ooi rrab stars , but the ac relations in other colors are either linear ( for @xmath5 color ) or quadratic ( for @xmath4 and @xmath6 colors ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in @xmath4 color , the ac relations at minimum light for both ooi and ooii rrab stars are well represented by a quadratic regression , which can also be seen from the right panel in figure [ fig_acmaxmin ] .",
    "the aim of this study is to continue the investigation of empirical pc and ac relations at maximum and minimum light for rr lyraes in sloan colors .",
    "such studies can be used to probe the radiation hydrodynamics of the outer envelopes of rr lyraes ( and cepheids ) , and potentially be used to estimate the foreground extinction with flat relations .",
    "the main differences between this work and previous work , presented in @xcite and @xcite , include ( a ) the application of a template light - curve fitting approach to determine the colors at maximum and minimum light instead of using fourier decomposition technique , ( b ) separating out the ooi and ooii rrab stars in our sample , which is not done in previous work , and finally ( c ) the investigation of the relations in four colors based on the sdss @xmath2 photometry instead of single color in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 color .",
    "since we applied the template light - curve fitting approach instead of the usual fourier decomposition technique as was done in the past @xcite , we compare the pc relations at maximum and minimum light based on both methods in figure [ fig_vsfourier ] .",
    "this figure reveals that the pc relations obtained from the fourier decomposition technique , using a fixed fitting order , are very similar to those based on template light - curve fitting , including the separation of ooi and ooii rrab stars in the @xmath4 pc relations at maximum light .",
    "this implies that both methods can deliver similar pc relations , and our results are not affected by the choice of fitting methods .",
    "however , figure [ fig_vsfourier ] also implies that pc relations , especially in the @xmath3 color , exhibit a larger scatter when using the fourier decomposition technique .",

    "\\end{array}$ ]    our explanation for the pc properties of rr lyraes relies on the hif - photosphere interaction @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the hif and photosphere are not co - moving during stellar pulsation . because of this , there are times when the stellar photosphere occurs at the base of the hif .",
    "the times when this occurs varies with the type of star ( rr lyrae or cepheids ) , period , and pulsation phase .",
    "when the two are not engaged in this way , the temperature of the photosphere and hence the color of the star will be related to the period . for rr lyraes , the hif and photosphere",
    "are always engaged but only at minimum light , the temperature and density are appropriate such that hydrogen reaches significant levels of ionization at temperatures that are increasingly independent of period .",
    "as the star brightens from minimum light , the temperatures that are needed to achieve significant levels of hydrogen ionization become increasingly dependent on density and hence a period - color relation develops .",
    "this is consistent with the results described here  where the slope of the pc relation at minimum light is not strictly zero but is significantly shallower than the slope at maximum light .",
    "the fact that the difference in slopes between the pc relations at maximum and minimum light for rrc stars is considerably smaller than that for fundamental mode rrab stars also provides strong support for the hif - photosphere theory .",
    "these rrc stars are typically hotter than rrab stars , and at these temperatures , saha ionization equilibrium is much more sensitive to the gas density and hence global stellar parameters .",
    "these remarks also apply to ac relations in the following sense .",
    "when there is a difference in pc slopes between minimum and maximum light due to the engagement of the hif - photosphere mentioned earlier , we expect a corresponding difference in the slope of ac relations at maximum / minimum light . as in @xcite , we can apply the stefan - boltzmann law at maximum and minimum light such that @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the amplitude at a given bandpass . here",
    "we neglect the radius terms assuming that temperature fluctuations are more important than radius variations in changing luminosity .",
    "thus if the slope of the pc relation decreases in going from maximum to minimum light , then the slope in an ac plot should decrease in going from minimum to maximum light .",
    "conversely , if the pc slope increases in going from maximum to minimum , then the ac slope should increase in going from maximum to minimum .",
    "table [ tab_ac_maxmin ] indeed shows this for @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors in the case of rrab stars .",
    "the evidence is not quite as strong for the @xmath6 color but in this case one may argue that this color is very much toward the red part of the spectrum so that flux variations due to temperature variations are considerably reduced .",
    "in fact , the rrc stars at @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors are also consistent with this .",
    "the behavior of the pc and ac relations for the @xmath3 color is not consistent with the theory described above , except in the case of ooii rrab stars , which exhibit a shallow pc slope at minimum light , but then the ac relation for these stars has a marginal positive slope . furthermore the rrc stars have a negative slope in the pc diagram at maximum light .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath271 and @xmath19 bands straddle the peak of the planck blackbody curve at temperatures relevant to rr lyraes .",
    "this perhaps could lead to the opposite - sign slopes seen in figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] for rrc stars .",
    "however , our preliminary calculations suggest that @xmath272 does not change slope for a range of temperatures between @xmath273 and @xmath274  k. thus it may be that bolometric corrections , similar to figure [ fig_vscc2008 ] , are responsible for this slope change though we leave a detailed discussion of this for future work .    the sdss colors of the rr lyrae in figure [ fig_pcmaxmin ] can be converted to effective temperature , logarithmic gravity , and bolometric luminosity using the conversions given in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_convert ] presents the converted temperatures , gravities , and luminosities , as well as the radii , as a function of period at maximum and minimum light . for rrab stars at minimum light",
    ", we immediately observe that up to @xmath275 , the temperature at the stellar photosphere does not vary much with period , relations must be due to bolometric corrections as discussed in section 3.1 . ] and exhibits a change at @xmath276 for ooi rrab stars and @xmath277 for ooii rrab stars . for longer periods ,",
    "the temperature at minimum light for rrab stars increases as the period increases .",
    "therefore , the hif - photosphere interaction at minimum light seems to occur at @xmath278 for ooi rrab stars and at @xmath279 for the ooii rrab stars . in the case of rrc stars ,",
    "their effective temperatures are hotter than the rrab stars and hence they do not show a flat relation , in agreement with @xcite . at maximum light ,",
    "the temperature decreases as pulsation period increases for both rrab and rrc stars .",
    "figure [ fig_convert ] also reveals that the ooi and ooii rrab stars can be well separated in several ways .",
    "one example is in the period - temperature and period - radius planes at maximum light .",
    "figure [ fig_fourier ] displays the fourier parameters for the rr lyrae light curves in sdss filters studied here .",
    "we see a clear differentiation in the @xmath280 and @xmath281 phase parameters with wavelength ( similar to cepheids , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a clear feature at @xmath275 in the amplitude parameters @xmath282 and @xmath283 for rrab stars as reported with ogle - iii data . it is striking that this feature occurs at the same period at which changes occur in the plots of @xmath284 against @xmath263 in figure [ fig_convert ] .",
    "rrc stars are also clearly differentiated on the fourier parameter - @xmath263 planes .",
    "further data collected from the lsst ( for example see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be very useful in connecting the change in light - curve structural properties , exemplified by the fourier parameters , to global stellar properties such as pc and ac relations studied here .    in summary",
    ", our study reveals that the structural form of pc and ac relations at maximum and minimum lights for rr lyraes are much more complicated than previously thought @xcite .",
    "they can be expressed as either a flat , a linear , or a quadratic relation in different colors .",
    "furthermore , the pc and ac relations for rrab stars are separated by oosterhoff types .",
