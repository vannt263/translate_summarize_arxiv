    "this feature is consistent with the theoretical consequence that the orbital responsible for the conduction band is @xmath5 orbitals , the spins on which generate anisotropic hyperfine fields at @xmath1c sites mainly through the on - site @xmath11 dipolar coupling . as temperature is decreased , however , the line is gradually broadened with the asymmetry less appreciable , very probably due to progressive contribution of inhomogeneity to the lineshape .",
    "the isotropic component of the knight shift , @xmath12 , is determined by subtracting the isotropic component of chemical shift , @xmath13 , from the first moment ( the center of gravity ) of the measured nmr spectra . as the value of @xmath13 , we employed the separately measured chemical shift of the non - magnetic [ zn(tmdt)@xmath0 with monovalent tmdt as in m = ni and pt ; that is @xmath14 ppm .",

    "we have no clear explanation on this discrepancy but it might be due to electron correlation , as discussed later .",
    "the @xmath12 monotonically decreases with temperature as @xmath17 does and they roughly scale to each other for both systems although the temperature variation of @xmath12 is more remarkable than that of @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the conduction bands of m = ni and pt salts consist of the @xmath5 orbitals solely.@xcite the nmr shift is proportional to the product of the hyperfine coupling constant at @xmath1c site and the local spin susceptibility . comparing the data in figs . 2 ( a ) and 2(c ) , the isotropic part of the hyperfine coupling constant , that is the ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath17 , is @xmath20 = 3.9 and 5.1 koe/(@xmath7 tmdt ) for m = ni and pt when evaluated by averaging the values above 200 k , indicating that the mulliken population of the @xmath21 orbital responsible for the hyperfine coupling is somewhat different between m = pt and ni . the linewidth @xmath15 increases",
    "gradually as temperature is decreased in both compounds , suggesting the development of local - field inhomogeneity .",
    "nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath22 , is usually defined as a characteristic time of the exponential decay of nuclear magnetization , @xmath23 $ ] , for nuclei with spin @xmath24 such as @xmath1c and @xmath2h nuclei . in case of anisotropic hyperfine coupling as in the present material , however , the recovery of @xmath1c nuclear magnetization in powdered samples does not obey a single - exponential function of time ; so , we defined @xmath22 by fitting the so - called stretched - exponential function , @xmath25 $ ] , to the relaxation curves .",
    "the standard errors in the estimate of @xmath22 and @xmath26 are mostly less than 6 @xmath18 for both m = pt and ni compounds .",

    "this can be caused by paramagnetic impurities like the linewidth behavior .",
    "the spin fluctuations as a manifestation of electron correlation in a paramagnetic metal is characterized by the so - called korringa ratio , @xmath31 , which is the relaxation enhancement factor in the korringa relation and is given , in the simple case of isotropic hyperfine coupling , as @xmath32 in case of anisotropic hyperfine coupling as in the present compounds , however , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is modified to a form with field angle as a parameter .",
    "further , when a sample is a powder , relaxation curves with angle - dependent @xmath33 are summed up into a non - single exponential function . as the volume - average of distributed @xmath33 is given by the relaxation rate of the initial slope , @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is extended to a form expressed by @xmath35 .",
    "we re - analyzed the relaxation curves to determine @xmath35 and confirmed that the temperature dependence of @xmath36 ( the inset of fig .",
    "4 ) is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "the chemical structure surrounding the @xmath1c site in tmdt is nearly the same as that in et , where the hyperfine field at the @xmath1c site mainly consist of an isotropic core - polarization field and a uniaxially symmetric dipole field from the on - site @xmath21 orbital@xcite .",

    "the total - shift tensor is given by @xmath39 where x and y axes are in the molecular plane and z axis is perpendicular to them .",

    "the total shift for a field directing to a spherical coordination , ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , is given by @xmath42 .",
    "its powder - distribution , @xmath43 , has parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath37 , which are obtained by fitting @xmath43 to the experimental spectra .",
    "in reality , however , inevitable inhomogeneity imposes additional broadening on the spectra . as seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the temperature dependence of @xmath15 is not scaled to that of @xmath12 , indicating a sizable contribution of inhomogeneous broadening to the lineshape at low temperatures .",
    "thus , in the analysis for extracting the values of @xmath37 , we incorporated the inhomogeneous broadening by convoluting @xmath43 with a lorentzian function in the following form , @xmath44 where @xmath45 characterizes the inhomogeneous width and is assumed to have a form of @xmath46 with the second term to express the width dependent on the shift .",
    "the form of eq .",

    "1 , with reasonable sets of parameter values . at lower temperatures , however , the fitting parameter values are scattered and unsettled , as expected because the lineshape becomes more isotropic at low temperatures due to the dominant contribution of the inhomogeneous broadening and @xmath37 is not resolved in the fitting . nevertheless , considering that the ratio , @xmath37/@xmath12 , should be temperature - independent because the form of the hyperfine tensor should not change under temperature variation , we use the reliable value of @xmath37/@xmath12 that is determined at high temperatures ; @xmath37/@xmath12 = 0.78 for m = ni and @xmath37/@xmath12 = 0.81 for m = pt .",
    "( thus , the hyperfine coupling constants are ( @xmath20 , @xmath49 ) = ( 3.9 , 3.0 ) and ( 5.1 , 4.1 ) in unit of koe/(@xmath7 tmdt ) for m = ni and pt , respectively . ) using fitting the lines for @xmath12 shown in fig . 2(a ) and the @xmath37 values determined from the above ratios along with the curves fitting the @xmath36 data shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 , we evaluate @xmath31 at temperatures for @xmath50 k , in which nmr parameters are much less affected by inhomogeneity . as shown in fig . 4 ,",

    "thus , the present materials are addressed as systems with non - negligible electron correlation .",
    "figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate , @xmath57 , of [ pt(tmdt)@xmath0 , which is determined by fitting a gaussian function to a spin - echo decay curve , as shown in the inset , and therefore is denoted by @xmath58 hereafter .",

    "figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath2h nmr line width evaluated by the square root of the second moment of @xmath2h nmr spectra of [ ni(tmdt)@xmath0 .",
    "the value of the line width , approximately 17 khz at room temperature , is reasonably explained by the @xmath2h nuclear - dipole interactions in the trimethylene group .",

    "@xmath60 remarkably increases as the frequency is decreased , implying that the fluctuations would be more enhanced at further lower frequencies than the nmr larmor frequencies of @xmath59mhz .",
    "such slow and frequency - dependent fluctuations that persist in a wide temperature range is not attributable to the conventional spin dynamics in a paramagnetic metal .",
    "such frequency - dependent peak structures in @xmath60 appear due to the molecular motions as observed in et compounds such as @xmath26-(et)@xmath53i@xmath54,@xcite @xmath56-(et)@xmath53cu(ncs)@xmath53@xcite and @xmath56-(et)@xmath53cu[n(cn)@xmath0cl,@xcite where the terminal ethylene in the et molecule has bi - stable configurations , as shown in fig .",
    "the conformational change is thermally activated to give a peak structure in @xmath60 against temperature variation when the characteristic frequency of the motions , which decreases with temperature , pass through the nmr probe frequency , @xmath65 .",
    "the nmr relaxation due to such molecular dynamics is caused through the coupling between the molecular motion and the nuclear dipolar field , and described by the bloembergen - purcell - pound ( bpp ) relation,@xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the correlation time of the molecular motion that varies with temperature and @xmath68 is a coupling constant between the nuclear relaxation and the molecular dynamics .",
    "if the motion is of such a type that it is activated over an energy barrier , @xmath67 is expressed in a form of @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the excitation energy for the conformation change and @xmath71 is an attempt frequency .",

    "turning to the present systems , however , the skeleton of the trimethylene is flat and fits well to the molecular plane of m(tmdt)@xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "8 ( b ) ) ; so it is unlikely that the structural dynamics of the trimethylene group contributes to @xmath60 in [ ni(tmdt)@xmath0 and [ pt(tmdt)@xmath0 as in et molecules .    to advance this argument , we measured @xmath60 for a powdered sample of neutral hmttf molecules , which contain trimethylenes ( see the insets of fig .",

    "figure 9 shows @xmath60 of hmttf together with that of [ ni(tmdt)@xmath0 measured at 156 mhz .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath60 of hmttf is negligibly small and differs in temperature dependence , compared with @xmath60 of [ ni(tmdt)@xmath0 , indicating that the molecular motions in question are not in the trimethylene .",

    "direct dipolar interactions between impurity spins and nuclear spins can cause a nuclear spin - lattice relaxation through the longitudinal and transverse interactions .",
    "in addition , in case of metals , nuclear spins are indirectly coupled with impurity spins through conduction electrons ; that is , the rkky interaction , which causes nuclear relaxation via two channels known as the benoit - de gennes - silhoutte ( bgs ) mechanism@xcite and the giovannini - heeger ( gh ) mechanism@xcite .",
    "we found the experimental universal curve of @xmath60 well described by a function of @xmath93 , as shown in figs .",
    "11 ( a ) and ( b ) , where @xmath94 represents the brillouin function of spin @xmath95 and the parameter @xmath96 , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the relaxation rate arising from the longitudinal dipolar interaction follows a function of @xmath93 , whereas the three other mechanisms have @xmath99 dependence.@xcite thus , @xmath60 at low temperatures is likely caused by the longitudinal dipolar interactions with impurity spins .",
    "small upward deviations of the data from the theoretical curve for large values of @xmath88 are attributable to the korringa contribution . as for @xmath45@xmath63 ,",
    "however , the data are best described by a comparably weighted sum of @xmath93 and @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that other interactions with impurity spins contribute to the @xmath1c nuclear relaxation along with the longitudinal dipolar interaction . at higher temperatures",
    ", @xmath63 shows the korringa relation . because @xmath33 arising from the rkky interaction is channeled through the korringa mechanism",
    ", @xmath63 at low temperatures can have appreciable contributions from the bgs and gh relaxation , compared to @xmath60 .",
    "figures 11(a ) and ( b ) show that , at low magnetic fields below ca .",
    "3 t , @xmath60 deviates from the universal @xmath88 scaling curve , which should be followed when the free impurity spins are in the zeeman splitting states .",
    "this deviation suggests that impurity spins have interactions of the order of 3 t ( equivalent to 0.3 mev ) with certain degrees of freedom other than magnetic field , which might be @xmath100 coupling with conduction electrons .",
    "alternatively , it may be the low - temperature remnant of the anomalous molecular dynamics .",
