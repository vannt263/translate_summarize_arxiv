    "the discrimination among different nonorthogonal pure quantum states becomes a fundamental issue in quantum information and computation theory @xcite .",
    "there are two schemes in order to achieve the task of recognizing nonorthogonal states .",
    "the first scheme is the _ unambiguous quantum states discrimination _ about which has been written many interesting works : some generic @xcite and others concerned with its applications @xcite .",
    "that scheme requires that , whenever an outcome is projected after the measurement process , one can , with nonzero probability , infer the prepared state without error , this is , unambiguously .",
    "this can be performed at the expense of allowing for a nonzero probability of inconclusive outcomes .",
    "optimum unambiguous states discrimination _ protocol is performed when the probability of success is maximum .",
    "thus , nowadays we know that , for discriminating with certainty any one amongst @xmath0 nonorthogonal and linearly independent ( li ) pure states , it will be required to map or to represent those states onto two orthogonal subspaces which are called the _ conclusive - subspace _ and the _ inconclusive - subspace_. in the first @xmath0-dimensional conclusive - subspace , each possible state to be discriminated has no null component on only one state belonging to an orthonormal basis whereas , in the inconclusive - subspace each state has no null component on one state of a set of @xmath0 linearly dependent ( ld ) states . in the second scheme , called the _ error - minimizing measurement _",
    "protocol , the recognition of non - orthogonal states accepts errors in the outcome results at the expense of that inconclusive outcomes are not allowed .",
    "the advantage of this scheme with respect to the former is that it can be applied to ambiguously discriminate ld states @xcite . in the second scheme",
    "an optimum ambiguous measurement process minimizes the probability of making a wrong guess about the prepared state .    in this article",
    "we study the _ complete quantum states discrimination _ scheme among @xmath0 equally separated pure quantum states .",
    "this _ complete scheme _ consists in the consecutive application of both protocols described above . to be specific ,",
    "first is applied the _ unambiguous quantum states discrimination _ protocol and , if it is not successful , then the system is mapped onto the _ inconclusive - subspace _ and then the _ error - minimizing measurement _ protocol is applied . this _ complete scheme _ allows getting all the obtainable information about the prepared state . before addressing that problem we consider the characterization of the allowed complex numbers associated with the inner product of the @xmath0 equally - separated pure quantum states .",
    "we find that the allowed areas on the _ unitary complex plane _ have the form of petals and that a point inside a petal - shape represents a li set of @xmath0 pure states , and a point on the edge of a petal represents a ld set of @xmath0 pure states .",
    "let us assume that the separation between two normalized states is their inner product @xcite , with its module going from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and its phase being between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath1 value of the module corresponds to two orthogonal states and the @xmath2 value refers to equal or parallel states .",
    "two different states are always li and this property can be characterized completely by the fact that the separation - module is different from @xmath2 . however , for more than two states the fact that the separation - modules among them are different from @xmath2 guarantees neither the li nor the ld property .",
    "thus an interesting question arises in this regard : given a set @xmath4 which has @xmath0 normalized and equi - separated states , i.e. @xmath5 what are the allowed values of @xmath6 ? for which of those values the @xmath4 is a set of li or ld states ?",
    "we know that @xmath4 is a li set when the identity @xmath7 is satisfied if and only if the @xmath0 coefficients @xmath8 s are all zero , otherwise it is a ld set .",
    "projecting eq .",
    "( [ lieq ] ) onto each @xmath9 state we obtain an @xmath0 times @xmath0 homogeneous linear equations system , being the @xmath8 s the @xmath0 unknown quantities . from that homogeneous linear equations system one",
    "finds that the @xmath4 is a li set when the following @xmath0 times @xmath0 matrix has determinant different from zero :    @xmath10\\left(\\alpha-1\\right)^{n-1},\\label{deta1}\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha^*-1)^n-\\alpha^*(\\alpha-1)^n}{\\alpha^*-\\alpha}.\\label{deta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ deta ]    the @xmath6-roots of @xmath11 correspond to sets of ld states .",
    "solutions such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 _ complex number _ are not allowed .",
    "first of all , we consider @xmath15 real .",
    "it is easy to show from eq .",
    "( [ deta1 ] ) that , in this case , the @xmath0 states @xmath16 , are li if and only if @xmath17 for @xmath18 the @xmath0 states are ld and all equals whereas , for @xmath19 the @xmath0 states are ld and form a symmetric structure in a @xmath20-dimensional subspace .",
    "the range @xmath21 is forbidden for @xmath0 equally - separated normalized states .",
    "for instance , a structure of three equi - separated states becomes ld just for @xmath22 which means that for this value of @xmath23 they can only lie on a @xmath24-dimensional plane on which they are _ separated _ by an angle of @xmath25 . that family of three states is the well known trine set @xcite .",
    "four equi - separated states become ld just for @xmath26 , i.e. , they collapse symmetrically at a @xmath27-dimensional subspace to form a tetrahedron .    secondly , we consider the case of purely imaginary , i.e. @xmath28 . from eq .",
    "( [ deta2 ] ) we find that @xmath29 is a li set for @xmath30 the extreme values , @xmath31 , correspond to @xmath0 equi - separated ld states whereas the range @xmath32 is not allowed for normalized states .",
    "in the general case we find that @xmath0 equally - separated and normalized li states can only have inner product @xmath33 which satisfies the constraint @xmath34 with @xmath35 whereas , at the contour defined by ( [ absalpha2 ] ) the @xmath0 equally - separated states are ld .",
    "therefore , the allowed values of the inner product , @xmath6 , for @xmath0 equi - separated states are inside the region defined by the eqs .",
    "( [ absalpha1 ] ) and ( [ absalpha2 ] ) .",
    "thus , each point in that zone represents a li set @xmath4 and each point on the outline ( [ absalpha2 ] ) represents a ld set of @xmath0 equi - separated states . in other words , for a given phase , @xmath36 , there are infinite li sets @xmath37 and only one ld set , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and all those families ( li s and the ld with @xmath36 fixed ) preserve the phase of their inner product changing only the module .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows those allowed region - values of @xmath6 with grey - degradation representing the ( [ psucc ] ) probability of success for : a ) @xmath40 , b ) @xmath41 , c ) @xmath42 and d ) @xmath43 .",
    "the clearest grey at @xmath44 means @xmath2 , black contour means @xmath1 , and white means the forbidden values .",
    "thus , it is worth emphasizing that along a radius ( @xmath36 fixed ) the sets @xmath37 preserve the phase , changing only the module of the involved inner product and just in the maximum allowed value ( [ absalpha2 ] ) of @xmath45 the @xmath0 states become ld lying symmetrically on a @xmath46 dimensional subspace .",
    "we can notice that the allowed surface in the complex unitary - circle decreases as @xmath0 increases , going from a disk for @xmath47 , passing thru forms like a petal for @xmath48 up to tends to be much closer to the positive real axis for @xmath49 . because of that reason we call those areas @xmath50 _ probability petal - shapes_.     with the ( [ psucc ] ) probability in grey - degradation for : a ) @xmath40 , b ) @xmath41 , c ) @xmath42 and d ) @xmath43 .",
    "the black contour of the grey - zone is the curve given by eq .",
    "( [ absalpha2 ] ) , and white color means the forbidden values.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]",
    "in the previous section we have characterized the sets of @xmath0 equi - separated states . in this section",
    "we shall describe the _ complete quantum pure states discrimination _ scheme for @xmath0 equally - separated and li pure states .",
    "let us begin by supposing that a quantum system of interest is prepared with probability @xmath51 in the state @xmath9 which belongs to the li set @xmath4 .",
    "the _ complete quantum pure states discrimination _ scheme is performed as follows : by means of a joint unitary operation , @xmath52 , an ancillary system , initially in a known normalized state @xmath53 , is coupled to the system of interest in such a way that : @xmath54 where the two ancillary normalized states , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are orthogonal .",
    "the set @xmath57 defines an orthonormal basis in the unambiguous - subspace of the system of interest .",
    "the @xmath58 are @xmath0 ld states lying on the ambiguous - subspace of the system of interest .",
    "that ld set allows preserving the phase of the inner products and it is unique as we saw in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "the @xmath59 probability amplitude helps to preserve the module of the inner product and , due to the symmetry , it does not depend on @xmath60 .",
    "hence , by performing a measurement process on the auxiliary system on the @xmath61 basis , the system of interest is mapped with probability @xmath62 onto the unambiguous - subspace and with probability @xmath63 onto the ambiguous - subspace .",
    "therefore , after that measurement procedure we have the possibility of obtaining unambiguously the information about the prepared state or of obtaining inconclusive information about the prepared state by implementing the so called _ ld states recognition with minimal - error _ protocol on the @xmath58 set @xcite .      since the inner product is preserved under a unitary transformation , from eq .",
    "( [ expsu ] ) we get : @xmath64 therefore , the probability of discriminating unambiguously the @xmath9 state is @xmath65 and the probability of discriminating unambiguously whichever be the prepared state , becomes @xmath66 first of all we emphasize two limits : i ) for @xmath47 and independently of the @xmath36 value the ( [ psucc ] ) probability of success , @xmath67 , becomes the peres s formula @xcite , @xmath68 , which also holds for all @xmath69 when @xmath70 , ii ) the ( [ psucc ] ) probability of success is zero on the outline ( [ absalpha2 ] ) which is in agreement with the fact that a set of ld states can not be unambiguously discriminated .",
    "we can also notice that the ( [ psucc ] ) probability of success depends on both the phase and the module of the involved @xmath6 .",
    "specifically @xmath67 is linear with respect to @xmath45 having its maximum value , @xmath2 , at @xmath71 and its minimum value , @xmath1 , at the @xmath72 cut - contour ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ figure2].a shows that linear behavior considering @xmath41 for different phases : @xmath70 ( solid ) , @xmath73 ( dashes ) , @xmath74 ( dots ) , and @xmath75 ( dash - dots ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can notice that for a given @xmath48 : for @xmath76 , all the range @xmath77 is allowed , whereas for @xmath78 the range of the phase is restricted having a wide window of values non - allowed .",
    "figure [ figure2].b shows the ( [ psucc ] ) probability as a function of @xmath36 considering @xmath41 for different modules of @xmath6 : @xmath79 ( solid ) , @xmath80 ( dashes ) , @xmath81 ( dots ) , and @xmath82 ( dash - dots ) .    :",

    "we have considered @xmath41.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]    we emphasize that for a given and allowed module @xmath45 the maximal probability of discriminating conclusively @xmath83 equally - separated states holds for the phase @xmath70 and curiously , in this case , the ambiguous - subspace is @xmath84dimensional since the @xmath0 equiseparated ld states , @xmath85 , are all equals . in other words , in the optimal case all the possible information to be gotten about the prepared states , is acquired unambiguously . on the other hand , for @xmath86",
    "each set , at the contour of the petal - shape , has @xmath0 equiseparated ld states symmetrically distributed in a ( @xmath87)-dimensional hilbert subspace . in those cases ( @xmath86 ) , at the ambiguous - subspace there can even be information about the prepared state and , even though this can no longer be unambiguously obtained , it can be inconclusively obtained by means of the so called _ ld states recognition with minimal - error _",
    "protocol @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can say that the non - maximal cases ( @xmath86 ) of obtaining certainly the precedence of the state is at the expense of that part of the information that can even be got with minimal - error .      when the unambiguous discrimination states process fails , the state of the system of interest is projected , with probability @xmath51 , onto the state @xmath88 , see eq .",
    "( [ expsu ] ) .",
    "those states belong to a ld set of @xmath0 equi - separated states symmetrically distributed at a @xmath46dimensional hilbert subspace .",
    "we would like to emphasize that for this analysis the @xmath0 equi - separated ld states must be different .",
    "in other words , our analysis is valid for @xmath86 since the @xmath70 case is a singularity because the @xmath0 states collapse to only one when @xmath36 goes to @xmath1 ( since @xmath89 ) .",
    "in addition , an obvious restriction to our analysis is @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in this _ minimal - error discrimination _ scheme the lowest error probability will be achieved by means of a measurement process of the observable @xmath90 whose eigenstates @xmath91 are in a one - to - one correspondence with each possible state of the ld set , @xmath92 , of the system of interest .",
    "let us suppose that each eigenstate @xmath93 has two components : one of them is lengthways parallel to its corresponding @xmath9 and the other one has a direction @xmath94 which is orthogonal to the _ ambiguous - subspace _ , this is , @xmath95 we can notice that @xmath88 has component @xmath96 on its associated @xmath93 and has component @xmath97 over any @xmath98 with @xmath99 . from the identity latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\sum_{m=1}^n\\langle\\alpha^{ld}_k(\\theta)|\\omega_m\\rangle\\langle\\omega_m|\\alpha^{ld}_k(\\theta)\\rangle&=&1\\nonumber\\\\    we obtain the square module of the @xmath96 probability amplitude : @xmath101 from eqs .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , ( [ a ] ) , and ( [ absalpha2 ] ) we can infer that the probability , @xmath102 , that the state will be correctly identified is : @xmath103 we notice that the minimum @xmath102 probability holds for @xmath104 whereas the maximum value is reached at @xmath75 . in other words , @xmath102 increases in the range @xmath105 going from @xmath106 to @xmath107 . on the other hand , in the range @xmath105 and for @xmath108",
    "the @xmath102 probability has the behavior @xmath109 from here we can see that the probability of correctly identifying the @xmath0 equiseparated ld states comes closer to @xmath2 for @xmath108 ; therefore , in this limit , the probability of erroneously inferring the prepared state comes closer to @xmath1 .    according to the described _ complete quantum pure states discrimination _ scheme ,",
    "see eq . ( [ expsu ] ) , the _ total probability _ , @xmath110 , _ of obtaining information _ about the prepared state of the system of interest becomes : @xmath111 we can define two more probabilities which give us knowledge about the _",
    "complete quantum pure states discrimination _ scheme : the @xmath112 which is the _ probability of inferring the prepared state with error _ and @xmath113 which corresponds to the _ probability of not obtaining information _ about the prepared state of the system of interest .",
    "we notice that the @xmath110 probability is linear and @xmath114 , which is equal to @xmath115 , is quadratic with respect to the allowed @xmath45 . in the subsection [ subsec1 ]",
    "we find that for a given and allowed @xmath45 the maximum value of @xmath67 is reached at @xmath70 and that probability decreases as @xmath36 goes from @xmath1 to @xmath116 . on the other hand , in subsection [ subsec2 ]",
    "we see that @xmath102 increases as @xmath36 goes from @xmath1 to @xmath116 .",
    "however , since @xmath110 is a composition of @xmath67 and @xmath102 it is not easy to estimate its behavior with respect to the @xmath36 parameter for a fixed @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the @xmath110 ( black ) and @xmath67 ( grey ) probabilities as functions of @xmath36 for different values of @xmath45 : @xmath79 ( solid ) , @xmath80 ( dashed ) , @xmath81 ( dotted ) , and @xmath117 . in order to compare with results of fig .",

    "we also notice that the _ total probability _",
    ", @xmath110 , _ of obtaining information _ about the prepared state is , in general , significatively higher than the probability , @xmath67 , of discriminating unambiguously the possible prepared states .",
    "this also guarantees that the probability of erroneously inferring the prepared state , @xmath119 , becomes small .",
