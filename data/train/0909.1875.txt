    "experimental studies of @xmath0 decays from unstable nuclei near the drip lines are developing nowaday due to recent progress of experimental techniques .",
    "gamow - teller(gt ) transition strength @xmath3 values were extracted not only for transitions to low - lying states but also those to highly excited states . moreover , determination of the @xmath3 values has been performed also in high resolution experiments of charge exchange reactions as well as the @xmath0 decays .    in these years , measurements of the @xmath0 decays of @xmath1li and @xmath2li were carried out in several experiments , for example , at the isolde facility in cern . they provide information of new states in @xmath1be and @xmath2be such as the excitation energies , spins and @xmath3 values . in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1li , the gt transitions to low - lying @xmath1be states in @xmath6 mev are weak while the strong transitions to the 11.81 mev state were reported@xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 value for the @xmath1be state at @xmath7 mev is surprizingly large as @xmath8 which takes 65 % of the ikeda sum rule , @xmath9 . in a new measurement of the @xmath0 decay@xcite",
    ", its spin and parity were assigned to be @xmath5 . compared with the mirror transitions from @xmath1c to the @xmath1b(@xmath5 ) state at 12.19 mev@xcite",
    ", this suggests the abnormally large mirror asymmetry that the @xmath3 value for the @xmath1be(@xmath5 ) at 11.81 mev is larger by factor 4 than that for the mirror transition as argued in ref .",
    "however , the shell - model calculations in a @xmath10-shell basis do not indicate such the large @xmath3 values in the @xmath1li decays nor the large mirror asymmetry@xcite",
    ".    the experimental measurements of the @xmath0 decay were performed also for the drip - line nucleus , @xmath2li@xcite .",
    "many excited states of @xmath2be were observed in low energy region . the gt transitions to @xmath2be states in @xmath6 mev are not strong and the extracted @xmath3 values are less than @xmath11 for the low - lying states@xcite . in a recent measurement , a new state at 18 mev in @xmath2be",
    "was observed and the value @xmath12 for this state was extracted from the branching ratios@xcite . as mentioned above , in the @xmath0 decays of neutron - rich li isotopes , the gt transitions to low - lying states of @xmath1be and @xmath2be are relatively weak compared with rather strong gt transitions to highly excited states .",
    "it is understood easily because of the cluster features of be isotopes . in theoretical studies of",
    "be isotopes , it was suggested that @xmath13 and @xmath14 cluster structures develop in most of the low - lying states of @xmath1be and @xmath2be , respectively @xcite .",
    "the gt transitions to such the cluster states should be suppressed because gt transition to an ideal @xmath15 cluster written by the @xmath16 configuration is forbidden exactly due to pauli principle .",
    "in other words , the high - lying states in @xmath17 mev with the strong gt transitions are expected to have significant components of cluster breaking .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the gt transition strengths of the @xmath0 decays , @xmath18li@xmath19be and @xmath2li@xmath20be , with a theoretical method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd)@xcite .",
    "distribution of the @xmath3 values is analyzed for each spin of the final states .",
    "particular attention is paid to the strong gt transitions to the @xmath1be @xmath21 state at 11.81 mev suggested in the experimental report .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the formulation of the present calculations .",
    "we explain the adopted effective interactions in [ sec : interactions ] , and show the calculated results as well as the experimental data in [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in [ sec : summary ] , we give a summary and an outlook .",
    "we use a method of amd which has been proved to be one of the useful approaches for structure study of light unstable nuclei . in the present work ,",
    "we first perform the variation after projection(vap ) with respect to the total - angular - momentum and parity projection(spin - parity projection ) in the amd  @xcite and extend the method to calculate gt strength functions to final states in a wide energy region .",
    "the detailed formulation of the basic amd method for nuclear structure study is described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the amd method ,",
    "a wave function of a @xmath22-nucleon system is written by a slater determinant of single - particle gaussian wave packets , @xmath23 where the @xmath24th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath25 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath26 ) and isospin(@xmath27 ) wave functions , @xmath28 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are represented by complex variational parameters , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the isospin function @xmath33 is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) .",
    "we take a fixed width parameter @xmath34 which is optimized for each nucleus .",
    "that is @xmath35 @xmath36 for @xmath1be and @xmath1li , and @xmath37 @xmath36 for @xmath2be and @xmath2li in the present calculations .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath38 .    for the lowest @xmath39 state , we vary the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath32(@xmath41 ) to minimize the energy expectation value of the hamiltonian , @xmath42 , with respect to the spin - parity projected amd wave function ; @xmath43 . here",
    ", @xmath44 is the spin - parity projection operator . after the energy variation",
    ", the optimized parameter set @xmath45 of the minimum - energy solution for the lowest @xmath39 state is obtained .",
    "the solution @xmath46 for the @xmath47th @xmath39 state is determined by varying @xmath48 so as to minimize the energy of the wave function orthogonalized to the lower states ; @xmath49 is the normalized wave function determined for the lower states .",
    "this is the standard procedure of the vap calculation in the amd method .    in the vap calculations ,",
    "the wave functions for the @xmath50 states are obtained one by one from the lower energy states and it is not easy to calculate all final states of the gt transitions which fragment generally into many high - lying states . in order to exhaust the gt strengths from an initial state , we extend the basis wave functions by operating one - body spin - isospin operators to the vap wave functions for the parent nucleus .",
    "let us consider the @xmath51 decay of @xmath18li .",
    "we perform the vap calculation of the lowest @xmath52 state of @xmath1li and obtain the wave function @xmath53 for the @xmath18li ground state . here",
    "we rewrite @xmath54 for @xmath1li with @xmath55 .",
    "final states of the gt transitions from the @xmath18li ground state are @xmath56 and @xmath5 states in the daughter nucleus @xmath1be . as for the final states in @xmath1be , we prepare the basis wave functions in two steps as follows .",
    "we first do the vap calculations for the lowest two @xmath39 states of @xmath1be , and obtain the wave functions @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 which approximately describe the corresponding low - lying states .",
    "next , we create other basis wave functions by operating the one - body spin - isospin operators to the @xmath64 as , @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is a neutron wave function in @xmath1li .",
    "@xmath68 is the one - body gt transition operator where @xmath69(@xmath70 and @xmath71 ) is the spin operator and @xmath72 is the charge changing operator . as a result",
    ", we get @xmath73 number of basis wave functions , @xmath74 , which exhaust the gt transition strengths from the @xmath64 .",
    "finally we determine the wave functions of the final @xmath1be states by the spin - parity projection and the superposition of all the @xmath75 basis wave functions , @xmath76 the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are determined by diagonalizing hamiltonian and norm matrices .    the value @xmath3 of the gt transition strength is written by the square of the reduced matrix element @xmath79 of the gt transition operator , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the axial - vector and vector coupling constants and taken to be @xmath83 in the present calculations .",
    "it is worth mentioning again that the gt transition strengths from the @xmath1li ground state written by the wave function @xmath84 are exhausted by the final states , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , of @xmath1be .",
    "the effective nuclear interaction adopted in the present work consists of the central force , the spin - orbit force and the coulomb force . for the central force , the mv1 force case ( 3 ) @xcite containing finite - range two - body and zero - range three - body terms",
    "is used . as for the spin - orbit force , the same two - range gaussian form as that in the g3rs force @xcite",
    "is adopted .",
    "the used values of the interaction parameters in the mv1 force are @xmath87 and @xmath88 of bartlett , heisenberg and majorana parameters , and the strengths of the spin - orbit force are taken to be @xmath89 mev .",
    "these parameters are the same as those used in the amd+vap calculations of @xmath90c and @xmath91be in refs .",
    "hereafter , we call this parameter set ( a ) . in order to see the interaction dependence of the gt transition strengths",
    ", we also use two sets of modified parameters , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the set ( b ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath92 mev has the same central force but the weaker spin - orbit force than ( a ) , and the set ( c ) @xmath93 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev contains the bartlett and heisenberg terms in the central force but the same strengths of the spin - orbit force as ( a ) .",
    "in the present results of the vap calculations for low - lying states of @xmath1be , it is found that @xmath13 cluster structure developes in the ground state(@xmath60 ) and excited states , @xmath62 , @xmath94 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "the calculated energy spectra of these low - lying states are consistent with those calculated with the @xmath13 cluster models@xcite and the experimental energy levels(table [ tab : bgt - be9 ] ) .    by adding the basis wave functions @xmath74 constructed from the spin - isospin operated @xmath1li wave functions to the vap wave functions as explained in [ sec : formulation ] , the final wave functions of @xmath1be are obtained and the @xmath3 values for the transitions @xmath1li@xmath95be are calculated .",
    "the calculated @xmath3 values to the final @xmath1be states up to @xmath96 mev are shown in table [ tab : bgt - be9 ] .",
    "the @xmath3 values to the ground state(@xmath60 ) , the @xmath62 , @xmath94 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 states are small .",
    "this is because those states of @xmath1be have the @xmath13 cluster structure and they have small overlap with the initial state of @xmath1li having no developed cluster structure .",
    "[ fig : be9-dense ] shows the density distribution in the intrinsic wave functions of the @xmath1be ground state(@xmath97 ) and that of the @xmath1li ground state(@xmath64 ) .",
    "it shows that the intrinsic structure changes drastically from the initial state to the final state .",
    "moreover , the gt transitions to such the cluster states with the @xmath98 core are suppressed because of pauli principle as mentioned before . in other words ,",
    "the finite @xmath3 values account for the slight dissociation of the ideal @xmath15 clusters in @xmath1be .",
    "in contrast to the small @xmath3 values to the low - lying states , the excited states at @xmath99 mev show significant gt strengths which come from the non-@xmath15-cluster states constructed from the spin - isospin operated @xmath1li wave functions given in eq .",
    "[ eq : gt - single ] .",
    "the strongest gt transition is found for the @xmath59 state in the present results . in the experimental measurements of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1li , rather large values of @xmath3",
    "were reported for the states around @xmath100 mev@xcite as @xmath101 for the @xmath102 mev state and @xmath103 for the @xmath7 mev state .",
    "the former state is suggested to be a @xmath104 state@xcite and it might correspond to the theoretical @xmath105 state in the present result .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath106 agrees to the experimental value .",
    "the spin and parity of the latter @xmath7 mev state was assigned as @xmath107 in the recent analysis of the @xmath51 decay of @xmath1li@xcite .",
    "although this state seems to correspond energetically to the calculated @xmath108 state , the theoretical @xmath3 value is much smaller than the experimental value of @xmath103 which exhausts 65 % of the ikeda sum rule .",
    "as shown later , there is no @xmath5 state having such the strong gt strength compatible to @xmath103 in the present calculation .",
    "also in the shell - model calculations , it is difficult to reproduce the extraordinary large @xmath3 value of the experimental data@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : be9-gt ] shows the @xmath3 distribution to excited states of @xmath1be up to @xmath109 mev calculated by using the interaction set ( a ) . in the @xmath3 values to @xmath110 states , the largest peak is found at @xmath111 mev , and some strengths distribute around 20 mev .",
    "the transition strengths to @xmath104 states distribute mainly in @xmath112 mev region .",
    "the @xmath3 values to @xmath5 states are relatively small compared with those to @xmath110 and @xmath104 states . in order to show the interaction dependence of the gt strengtions",
    ", we show the @xmath3 distribution calculated with three interaction sets ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : be9-gt - hist ] .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution is qualitatively similar between these three interaction sets , though the broadness of the distribution changes slightly .",
    "in all the results , the @xmath3 values are very small for the transitions to low - energy @xmath113 mev states , while the strengths distribute mostly in @xmath112 mev .",
    "compared with the shell model calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , which show the @xmath3 distribution concentrating at @xmath114 mev , the present calculations show significant fraction of the @xmath3 values to highly excited states in @xmath115 mev .    .",
