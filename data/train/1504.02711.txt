    "state - of - the - art ultra - stable microwave oscillators are currently based on a whispering gallery mode sapphire resonator operated in the range @xmath0 ghz . the best near carrier phase noise is achieved with a room temperature sapphire resonator oscillator incorporating a sophisticated electronic degenerating the noise of the sustaining oscillator stage @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the cryogenic sapphire oscillator ( cso ) in which the sapphire resonator is cooled near 6 k , provides a fractional frequency stability better than @xmath1 for integration times lower than 10,000 s @xcite .",
    "the recent demonstration of a low maintenance cso based on a pulse - tube cryocooler paves the way for its deployment in real field applications @xcite .",
    "such oscillators are required for the operation of laser cooled atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "the cso can provide the means to improve the resolution of the space vehicules ranging and doppler tracking provided by deep space networks as well as those of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observatories @xcite . the cso can also enhance the calibration capability of metrological institutes or help the qualification of high performances clocks or oscillators @xcite .",
    "+ the cso exceptional performances result from the intrinsic properties of the material in which the resonator is machined .",
    "a high q - factor requires a monocrystal with a low structural defects density . with a high quality sapphire crystal at 4",
    "k , q - factor of @xmath2 are typically obtained for whispering gallery modes around 10 ghz .",
    "nevertheless the sapphire crystal should not be a perfect one .",
    "indeed the thermal compensation induced by the accidental paramagnetic impurities that substitute to al@xmath3 is essential for the achievement of the highest frequency stability .",
    "the main issue is that the impurities concentration giving a suitable turnover temperature between 5 - 8 k is very low ( typically less than 1 ppm ) and can not be warranted by the manufacturer . to build a cso",
    "the designer has no other choice than to buy expensive crystals without knowing if they are suitable for his application .",
    "a cryogenic test is the only way to reveal the temperature dependance of the resonator frequency and thus to fix the operating temperature .",
    "+ in this paper we present the characterization of cryogenic sapphire resonators produced with different growth techniques and by different manufacturers .",
    "although far to be exhaustive , the results presented in this paper will help to the building of an optimized cso and show that state - of - the - art frequency stability can be obtain with several kinds of sapphire crystal .",
    "the cso incorporates as a frequency reference a cylindrical sapphire resonator placed in the center of a copper cavity that can be cooled down to 4 k. in this structure , high order whispering gallery modes are characterized by a high energy confinement in the sapphire disk due the total reflection at the vacuum - dielectric interface .",
    "the different resonators we designed operate on quasi - transverse magnetic whispering galery modes as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of wavelength in the resonator along the azimuth . to operate in the @xmath0 ghz frequency range , the resonator diameter is @xmath6-@xmath7 mm and its thickness @xmath8-@xmath9 mm .",
    "if the azimuthal index is sufficiently high ( @xmath10 typically ) the q factor can achieve @xmath2 at the liquid - he temperature .",
    "+ the cso is pound - galani oscillator @xcite . in short ,",
    "the resonator is used in transmission mode in a regular oscillator loop , and in reflexion mode as the discriminator of the classical pound servo @xcite . in an autonomous cryocooled cso",
    ", the sapphire resonator is placed into a cryostat and in thermal contact with the second stage of a pulse - tube cryocooler delivering typically 0.5 w of cooling power at 4 k. the resonator temperature can be stabilized above 4 k at @xmath11k .",
    "details on the design and on the techniques that have to be applied to get an ultimate frequency stability can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ our goal is to provide an ultra - stable oscillator that meets the most stringent short term frequency stability specifications , such as those for the deep space network for satellites and space vehicles navigation . in this way , let us specify a short - term fractional frequency stability expressed in term of allan standard deviation as :    @xmath12    the question we address is what are the required resonator properties and which type of sapphire material is suitable to meet this specification .",
    "as explained in @xcite , in our most advanced cso , a @xmath13 mm , @xmath14 mm resonator is operated on the @xmath15 mode near 10 ghz .",
    "the input coupling coefficient @xmath16 has to be set near unity to optimize the pound discriminator .",
    "the ouput coupling coefficient @xmath17 should be low enough to not degrade the loaded q - factor but to stay compatible with the gain of the sustaining amplifier .",
    "overall insertion losses through the cryostat of @xmath18 db or so is generally a good trade - off . with optimized coupling coefficients , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the loaded q - factor is the half of the unloaded one : @xmath21 .",
    "noise in the electronics is the main source of short - term instabilities ; how exactly this noise affects the frequency stability depends on the oscillator configuration and on @xmath22 . without characterizing the exact nature of the oscillator s individual noise sources , one would like a rough estimate of what the resonator s bandwidth should be to achieve a given frequency stability .",
    "it is generally admitted that the attainable frequency stability @xmath23 at a given time interval ( e.g.  @xmath24 s ) can not be lower than a given fraction of the resonator bandwidth @xmath25@xcite .",
    "we thus define an empirical figure of merit , namely the `` line splitting factor '' , or @xmath26 , as the ratio of the frequency fluctuations @xmath27 averaged over @xmath28 of the generated signal divided by the resonator s bandwidth .",
    "if @xmath29 is the signal frequency , the @xmath26 is : @xmath30    the @xmath26 provides a way of quantifying the overall effect of the noise associated with the oscillator s electronics . considering the best experimental results obtained to date @xcite , we assume @xmath31 , which is a conservative value .",
    "thus , to get a stability of @xmath32 , the minimum resonator unloaded q - factor is : @xmath33      the resonator frequency is determined by its geometry and by the wave velocity inside the medium .",
    "these physical characteristics are in turn affected by the resonator s temperature and the power of the injected signal .",
    "the resonator s sensitivity to these environmental parameters limits the oscillator s medium term frequency stability .",
    "+      for an ideal resonator made in pure sapphire , although the frequency thermal sensibility would decrease significantly with temperature , it will never be low enough to achieve the target stability with a state - of - the - art temperature controler .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that high - purity sapphire crystals always contain a small concentration of paramagnetic impurities , as cr@xmath34 , fe@xmath34 or mo@xmath34 . at low temperatures ,",
    "these residual impurities induce a magnetic susceptibility @xmath35 whose temperature dependence can in certain circumstances compensate the intrinsic sensitivity of the pure sapphire .",
    "following the notation introduced by mann @xcite , for a high - order whispering gallery mode the thermal dependance of the resonator frequency @xmath29 can be written as : + @xmath36 where , @xmath37 would be the mode frequency at 0k in a pure sapphire resonator .",
    "@xmath38 k@xmath39 combines the temperature dependance of the dielectric constant and the thermal expansion @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 is the real part of the susceptibility induced by the paramagnetic dopants . if the sapphire crystal contains a density @xmath41 of a paramagnetic ion characterized by its electron spin resonance ( esr ) frequency @xmath42 and a spin - to - spin relaxation time @xmath43",
    ", @xmath44 is a dispersive lonrentzian function that nulls at @xmath42 @xcite :    @xmath45    the thermal dependance is contained in the dc - susceptibility @xmath46 , which results from the distribution of the ions on their energy levels through the effect of the thermal agitation .",
    "assuming the ion in the crystal lattice behaves like a free spin @xmath47 , @xmath46 is expected to follow the curie law @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the permeability of free space and @xmath50 the boltzmann constant . to make explicit",
    "the @xmath51 dependance of the susceptibility , let us introduce @xmath52 as : @xmath53 the equation [ equ : f - t - sens ] can be rewritte as : @xmath54    a thermal compensation can occur if the derivative of equation [ equ : f - t - sens-2 ] nulls , which imposes @xmath55 , and thus @xmath56 , which means @xmath57 , i.e the signal frequency is below the esr . in this case , the temperature @xmath58 at which the resonator thermal sensitivity nulls is : @xmath59    the esr characteristics of ions commonly found in sapphire is given in the table [ tab : ions ] .",
    "we reported also for each paramagnetic specy the value of @xmath58 calculated from the equation [ equ : t0 ] for @xmath60 ppm and at 10 ghz .",

    "until now , due to its superior properties the hemex crystal was always choosen in the realization of an ultrastable microwave cryogenic oscillator .",
    "the previous results show that the kyropoulos crystal can also constitute a good material for a cryogenic resonator .",
    "we thus incorporated the ky - pst-2013 resonator in one of our cso .",
    "its fractionnal frequency stability has been determined by beating its output with another cso equiped with a hemex grad resonator .",
    "the resulting allan standard deviation is given in the figure [ fig : figure-7 ] .",
    "the apparent flicker floor obtained with the kyropoulos resonator is @xmath61 whereas it was @xmath62 with an optimized hemex cso @xcite .",
    "such a difference can be attributed to the lower q - factor of the kyropoulos resonator . as expected",
    "the long term drift of kyropoulos cso is higher than those observed with the hemex cso .",
    "as ralready mentionned , the kyropoulos crystal is simply maintained by a brass screw passing through the hole along its axis .",
    "the resulting stress induced into the effective resonator volume relaxes with time , leading to a drift 10 times larger than the drift observed when the resonator is equiped with a spindle .",
    "we tested sapphire crystals produced with different growth methods in order to determine which type is suitable to build an ultra - stable cryogenic oscillator . at room temperature the q - factor of all the tested crystal",
    "is limited by the sapphire loss tangent , i.e @xmath63 at 10 ghz . at low temperatures the hemex and the kyropoulos resonators both present a q - factor higher than @xmath64 and a turnover temperature compatible with an operation in a cryocooler .",
    "these resonators have been used as the frequency determining element of a cryogenic oscillator and a fractional frequecy stability better than @xmath1 at short term has been obtained in both cases .",
    "furthermore the analysis of the modes thermal behavior between 4k and 12k allows us to approximatly determine the impurities contents of each crystals .",
    "the work has been realized in the frame of the anr projects : equipex oscillator - imp and emergence uliss-2 g .",
