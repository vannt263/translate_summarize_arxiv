    "above the resonance region , the transverse cross section @xmath5 measured in charged - pion electroproduction is significantly larger than predicted by regular hadronic models @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kaskulov and mosel proposed a framework explaining this observation . in the kaskulov - mosel formalism , the missing transverse strength is provided by the residual effects of nucleon resonances in the gauge - fixing @xmath4 ( or @xmath6 ) channel .",
    "it is argued that such contributions become more important for increasing intermediate - proton and photon virtualities .",
    "indeed , above the resonance region the proton is highly off - shell and the contributions from more massive intermediate states increase in importance . with growing intermediate - proton virtuality ,",
    "also the hardening of the resonance electromagnetic transition can be anticipated to play an increasingly important role .",
    "this results in a dual viewpoint in which the residual effects can be interpreted as originating from the partonic picture of hadrons .    the resonance - parton ( r - p ) contributions are effectively implemented by means of an electromagnetic ( em ) transition form factor for the proton in the @xmath4 channel . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new version of this form factor was proposed which has a simple physical interpretation and respects the correct on - shell limit .",
    "the resulting model was dubbed the `` vrancx - ryckebusch '' ( vr ) model and offers an explanation for the high - energy , forward - angle @xmath0 and @xmath1 electroproduction data , thereby covering a wide range of invariant masses ( @xmath7 ) and photon virtualities ( @xmath8 ) .    from the observations in the pion case , along with su(3 ) symmetry considerations , one may infer that an increased transverse response might also occur in charged - kaon electroproduction . within the vr framework ,",
    "this can be anticipated from the employed strategy of introducing an effective em transition form factor for the proton in the @xmath4 channel , accounting for the r - p contributions .    to this day ,",
    "no @xmath5 data is available for high - energy @xmath2 electroproduction and it is to be awaited if its magnitude is larger than expected . in this regard",
    "it is worth noting that the measured @xmath3 unseparated cross section @xmath9 at high energies can be reproduced by the vanderhaeghen - guidal - laget ( vgl ) model @xcite after introducing an effective kaon em form factor .",
    "the kaon em cutoff energy employed in the vgl model is significantly increased compared to the value extracted from elastic @xmath10 scattering .",
