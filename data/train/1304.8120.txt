    "two - particle correlations are a valuable tool to study heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "correlation functions are often formed by particle pair density in real events divided by that from mixed - events , where the two particles are taken from different events . with proper normalization",
    "the deviation of the correlation function from unity reveals correlations between two particles .",
    "this technique applies to situations where all particle pairs are correlated , for example , in hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) interferometry  @xcite and anisotropic flow correlations  @xcite .",
    "one unique case of correlations is jet angular correlations .",
    "the study of jet correlations has provided wealth of information about relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the object of interest is a cluster of particles  not all particles in the event  that are correlated due to their common origin of parton fragmentation .",
    "the interest is often to find number of correlated particles and their angular distributions .",
    "the correlations are often formed in terms of the particle pair azimuthal angle difference , @xmath3 and pseudorapidity difference , @xmath1 .",
    "the mixed - event technique is widely used , not as the uncorrelated baseline as in hbt or anisotropic flow analysis , but to correct for two - particle acceptance .",
    "for example , in mid - rapidity region , the mixed - event two - particle density is approximately triangular in @xmath1 , and is used for @xmath1 acceptance correction after normalized to 100% at @xmath4 .",
    "this mixed - event method for two - particle acceptance correction is , however , wrong .",
    "the correct two - particle acceptance should be the convolution of two single - particle acceptances ( or efficiency functions ) .",
    "it has nothing to do with the _ measured _ single - particle densities , but only depends on detector efficiencies .",
    "the mixed - event two - particle density , on the other hand , depends on both the detector efficiencies and the true single - particle densities .    in the widely used mixed - event acceptance correction ,",
    "the single - particle distributions are mistaken as detection efficiencies , implying that the true distributions ( e.g.  the pseudorapidity density @xmath5 ) are always uniform . by using mixed - event technique ,",
    "the `` corrected '' two - particle correlation signal in @xmath1 is guaranteed to be uniform except regions of correlation signals .",
    "the truth may , of course , not be uniform as the single - particle @xmath5 at mid - rapidity is not strictly uniform .",
    "this , however , does not make a big error for mid - rapidity particles in symmetric collisions , where particle density is nearly uniform in @xmath2  @xcite",
    ". the mixed - event acceptance correction could be further from truth for asymmetric collisions , such as proton - lead ( p - pb ) collisions , where the single - particle @xmath5 is nonuniform even at mid - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the corrected two - particle correlations will , again , be uniform by construction except the @xmath1 regions of any correlation signal . but this clearly is wrong .",
    "it is easy to see in the following simple example .",
    "suppose in a jet - correlation study in @xmath1 , the high-@xmath6 trigger particle is fixed at @xmath7 and all other particles are paired with the trigger to form angular correlation function .",
    "there will be a peak at @xmath4 due to jet correlations and the underlying background will have the same shape as the underlying event single - particle @xmath5 distribution .",
    "the two - particle acceptance correction to be applied should be the single - particle efficiency as function of @xmath2 ( because the trigger particle is always at @xmath7 ) .",
    "after correction , the signal should be the real jet signal on top of the real background which , in this case , is the true single - particle density which may not be uniform in @xmath2 .",
    "if the mixed - event @xmath1 distribution ( which is the single - particle @xmath2 distribution in this simple case ) is used as the acceptance correction , then the corrected pair density will be completely flat in @xmath1 except for regions of correlation signal .",
    "clearly , this does not reflect the true physics condition and will be wrong .    in real data analysis , often",
    "all pairs of trigger and associated particles are used . in asymmetric collisions ,",
    "neither the trigger nor the associated particle @xmath2 density may be uniform . averaging over all trigger and associated particles ,",
    "the nonuniformities in the single - particle @xmath5 distributions , however , become a second - order effect in the two - particle density distribution of @xmath8 . to see this , we take the simple example of a measured single - particle density to be linear in @xmath2 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the acceptance limits",
    ". the combinatorial two - particle density distribution will be    @xmath11\\,.\\label{eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effect of nonuniformity is quadratic in @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 which is typically the case for mid - rapidity region , the two - particle density is approximately triangular in @xmath1 .",
    "note that the two - particle density integrated over trigger and associated particle @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) is symmetric with respect to @xmath4 even though those for fixed trigger @xmath2 are all asymmetric .",
    "this is because , taking @xmath14 as example , the larger associated particle density at positive @xmath1 is weighted by the relatively fewer trigger particles at negative @xmath2 , and vise versa .    in most @xmath1-@xmath3 correlation analyses ,",
    "the mixed - event technique is used for two - particle acceptance correction and , as we have discussed , the final correlated yield is uniform by construction . if the correct acceptance is used from convolution of single - particle efficiencies , the resulting two - particle density does not deviate much from a uniform distribution , as we have shown above . for example , for a perfect single - particle efficiency",
    ", the real two - particle acceptance is a triangle .",
    "the relative error the mixed - event correction makes by using ( the properly normalized ) eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) is @xmath15 for relatively small @xmath12 , the error due to mixed - event two - particle acceptance correction is small . for large @xmath16 as measured in central 20% d+au collisions at rhic by phobos  @xcite over a hypothetical acceptance range of @xmath17 ( i.e.  @xmath18 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) gives @xmath19% error at @xmath20 and @xmath21% error at @xmath22 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .    ) that the mixed - event acceptance ( @xmath23 ) makes relative to the true two - particle acceptance ( @xmath24 ) for a perfect detector ( 100% efficiency@xmath0acceptance uniform in @xmath2).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have so far focused on a technical point , that two - particle acceptance correction in @xmath1 should not be obtained from mixed - events , but rather from convolution of two single - particle efficiency@xmath0acceptance functions .",
    "now we want to turn to an important physics implication of this point .    surprisingly , a strong large-@xmath1 ( @xmath1 @xmath25 2 ) near - side ( @xmath26 ) correlation is observed in p - pb collisions above a uniform zyam ( zero yield at minimum  @xcite ) background at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "this is called the `` ridge '' following the observation in heavy - ion collisions where an elliptic flow modulated background is subtracted  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the ridge in p - pb is as strong as that in heavy - ion collisions , where the ridge is considered to be primarily a consequence of anisotropic triangular flow . as we have discussed , it is by construction of the mixed - event technique that the observed ridge in p - pb collisions is uniform in @xmath1 , and it will likely remain uniform even using the correct two - particle acceptance correction because the trigger and associated particles in a wide @xmath2 range are averaged .",
    "however , the extra feature of the nonuniform single - particle @xmath2 distribution in p - pb collisions may be essential to unravel the underlying physics mechanisms for the ridge correlations . in order for any possible @xmath1 or @xmath2 dependence of the ridge to be observable",
    ", one needs to fix the trigger particle @xmath27 within a narrow bin and study correlations of associated particles , @xmath28 .",
    "there are two leading theoretical models for the physics mechanism of the ridge in small systems .",
    "one is hydrodynamics where the initial geometry anisotropy is converted into final - state anisotropic ( dominantly elliptic ) particle distributions by hydrodynamical evolution  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic particle distributions result in an enhanced two - particle density at @xmath29 , manifested as the ridge . in this picture ,",
    "the ridge strength is proportional to the underlying background pair density : @xmath30 because the underlying event baseline @xmath31 depends on @xmath1 , a measurement of the signal @xmath32 will be informative about the nature of the ridge . of course , the anisotropic harmonic @xmath33 ( product of the two single - particle azimuthal anisotropies , @xmath34 ) may also depend on @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath35 may not uniquely confirm or refute the hydrodynamic explanation , but should provide an important extra information . in this respect , it would be crucial to have predictions of the @xmath2 dependences of @xmath36 and @xmath37 from hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "the second model is the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the cgc framework gives particular predictions of the two - gluon production process as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "a calculation for au+au collisions is given in ref .",
    "@xcite which attributes the ridge to a net effect of the cgc enhanced two - gluon production and the strong collective radial flow .",
    "calculations of the @xmath1 dependence of the ridge in p - pb collisions are not yet available but should be extremely valuable .",
    "presumably , different physics mechanisms would yield different @xmath1 dependences of the ridge correlations , as well as different energy dependences .",
    "measurements of the ridge as a function of @xmath1 at both the lhc and rhic should , therefore , put stringent constraints on models .    experimentally , the two - particle acceptance should be taken from the convolution of two single - particle efficiencies . for trigger particles in a fixed narrow @xmath2 range ,",
    "the two - particle acceptance is approximately the single - particle efficiency@xmath0acceptance for associated particles .",
    "one obtains the near - side raw yield vs.  @xmath1 and subtracts the combinatorial background by , for example , the zyam procedure  @xcite . the zyam magnitude as a function of @xmath1",
    "may be treated as the underlying background particle pair density .",
    "one then examines whether the background - subtracted signal is uniform in @xmath1 , proportional to the background pair @xmath1 density in the zyam region , or of any other shape .    to examine the ridge yield relative to the combinatorial background",
    ", one may not even need to do two - particle acceptance correction .",
    "one can simply form the ratio of the pair density from real events to that from mixed - events ( i.e.  the original correlation analysis ) , but with fixed narrow @xmath2 bins for trigger particles , and examine the shape of the correlation function in the ridge region of large @xmath1 .",
    "one may not even need mixed - events , but treat the pair density in the zyam @xmath3 region as the combinatorial background and examine the ratio of the pair density in the ridge region at small @xmath3 to that in the zyam region , both of a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the idea of @xmath1 dependence of the ridge can be applied to asymmetric heavy - ion collisions , for example , the available cu+au collision data from rhic .    in summary , we point out the misconception in two - particle acceptance correction by the mixed - event technique .",
    "the mixed - event acceptance correction is , in principle , wrong and guarantees a uniform @xmath1 combinatorial pair density ( correlation ) .",
    "the correct two - particle acceptance should be the convolution of two single - particle efficiency@xmath0acceptance functions .",
    "the effect of the improper mixed - event correction is , however , small in present experimental data where both the trigger and associated particles are integrated over extended @xmath2 ranges . with a fixed narrow @xmath2 range for trigger particles and the proper acceptance correction ,",
    "the correlation signal may reveal a @xmath1 dependence , especially for asymmetric collision systems such as p - pb collisions recently available at the lhc",
    ". a @xmath1 dependence , if present , could be crucial to discriminate physics models for the observed ridge .",
