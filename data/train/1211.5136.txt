    "the quantum mechanical coupling parameter @xmath145 lies between @xmath26 and @xmath159 .",
    "simple algebraic considerations show that the strength of the quartic potential only shifts the energy regimes for which the anharmonic effects become important . therefore , as long as the analysis includes a regime wide enough in energy the effect of the anharmonicity can be measured for any non vanishing value of @xmath22 and should not depend strongly on it . performing the statistical analysis for a lower number of eigenenergies , cutting off at a specific principal quantum number @xmath160 leads to a decrease of the chaoticity parameters for @xmath161 , while the results for @xmath162 remain unaltered .",
