    "since the launch of the swift satellite , precise data from its burst alert telescope ( bat ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) have been obtained on the spectral and temporal behaviour of the x - ray emission of long - duration @xmath0-ray bursts ( lgrbs ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) from their beginning until late times .",
    "the early data are often complemented by the ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot ) on board swift , and by ground - based _ uvo _ and @xmath1 robotic and conventional telescopes .",
    "the ensemble of these data have already been used to test the most - studied theories of long duration grbs and their afterglows ( ags ) , the _ fireball _ ( fb ) models ( see , e.g.  zhang & mszros  2004 , zhang  2007 , and references therein ) and the _ cannonball _ ( cb ) model [ see , e.g.  dar & de rjula  2004 ( hereafter dd2004 ) , dado , dar & de rjula ( hereafter ddd )  2002a , 2003a , and references therein ] .",
    "the swift x - ray light curves of lgrbs roughly divide into two classes , ` canonical ' and non - canonical ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 , obrien et al .  2006 , zhang  2007 ) .",
    "when measured early enough , the observed x - ray emission has prompt peaks which coincide with the @xmath0-ray peaks of the grb , and a rapidly declining light curve with a fast spectral softening after the last detectable peak of the grb .",
    "this rapid decline and spectral softening of the prompt emission end within a few hundreds of seconds . in canonical lgrbs",
    "the x - ray light curve turns sharply into a much flatter ` plateau ' with a much harder power - law spectrum , typically lasting thousands to tens of thousands of seconds , and within a time of order one day it steepens into a power - law decay , which lasts until the x - ray ag becomes too dim to be detected ( fig .  [ f1 ] )",
    ".    the plateau phase is missing in non canonical grbs , and the asymptotic power - law decline begins the decay of the prompt emission and lasts until the x - ray become too dim to be detected ( fig .  [ f2 ] ) without any observable break .    in an significant fraction of otherwise canonical grbs , the rapid decay and fast spectral softening of the prompt emission changes to a slower power - law decay , @xmath2 , and a harder spectrum , before it reaches the plateau ( fig .",
    "we shall refer to such light curves as ` semi - canonical ' .",
    "the swift x - ray data show a flaring activity in a large fraction of grbs , both at early and late times .",
    "the x - ray peaks during the prompt @xmath0- ray emission follow the pattern of the @xmath0-ray pulses , they must have a common origin .",
    "in many grbs , superimposed on the early - time fast decaying x - ray light curve , there are x - ray flares , whose peak intensities also decrease with time and whose accompanying @xmath0-ray emission is probably below the detection sensitivity of bat . yet , their spectral and temporal behaviour is similar to that of the prompt x/@xmath0 pulses",
    ". very often the flaring activity continues into the afterglow phase .",
    "late - time flares appear to exhibit different temporal and spectral behaviours than early - time flares .",
    "neither the general trend , nor the frequently complex structure of the swift x - ray data were predicted by ( or can be easily accommodated within ) the standard fb models ( see , e.g.  zhang & mszros 2004 , piran  2005 , for reviews ) .",
    "much earlier confrontations between predictions of the fb models and the observations also provided severe contradictions , such as the failure to understand the prompt spectrum on grounds of synchrotron radiation ( e.g.  ghisellini , celotti , & lazzati 2000 ) , or the ` energy crisis ' in the comparison of the bolometric prompt and ag fluences ( e.g.  piran  1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "we have discussed elsewhere other problems of fb models ( dd2004 , dar  2005 and references therein ) , including those related to ` jet breaks ' ( e.g.  ddd2002a , dar  2005 , ddd2006 ) , and the a - posteriori explanations of the reported detections ( grb 021206 : coburn and boggs  2003 , see however wigger et al .",

    "2007 ) of large @xmath0-ray polarization ( ddd2007b , and references therein ) .",
    "the swift data have challenged the prevailing views on grbs .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concluded that the prompt @xmath0-ray emission can not be produced in shocks , internal or external .",
    "zhang , liang & zhang  ( 2007 ) found that the fast decay and rapid spectral softening ending the prompt emission can not be explained by high latitude emission . the x - ray and optical afterglows of swift grbs are very chromatic at early time in contrast with the fireball model expectation . moreover , curran et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have carefully examined swift data and found that x - ray and optical ags have chromatic breaks which differ significantly from the jet break of the blast - wave model of ags .",
    "burrows and racusin  ( 2007 ) examined the xrt light curves of the first @xmath3 swift grbs and reported that the expected jet breaks are extremely rare .",
    "in particular , liang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have analyzed the swift x - ray data for the 179 grbs detected between january 2005 and january 2007 and the optical ags of 57 pre- and post - swift grbs .",
    "they did not find any burst satisfying all the criteria of a jet break .    in spite of the above failures , not all authors are so critical .",
    "some posit that the swift data require only some modifications of the standard fb models to accommodate the results ( e.g.  panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 , dai et al .  2007 ,",
    "sato et al .  2007 ) .",
    "others still view the situation with faith ( e.g.  covino et al .",
    "2006 , panaitescu  2008 , dai et al .",
    "2008 , racusin et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "the situation concerning the cb model is different .",
    "the model was based on the assumption that lgrbs are produced by highly relativistic jets of plasmoids of ordinary matter ( shaviv & dar  1995 ) ejected in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions akin to sn1998bw ( dar & plaga  1999 , dar & de rjula 2000 ) .",
    "it successfully described the broad - band ags observed before the swift era ( e.g.  ddd2002a , ddd2003a ) and exposed the consistent photometric evidence for a lgrb / sn association in all nearby grbs ( ddd2002a , dd2004 and references therein ) long before grb 030329 .",
    "in the case of grb 030329 the first @xmath4 days of ag data were described by the cb model precisely enough to extrapolate them to predict even the date in which its associated sn would be bright enough to be detected spectroscopically ( ddd2003c ) .",
    "general acceptance of the grb - sn association waited until the spectroscopic discovery of sn2003dh , coincident with grb 030329 ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 , stanek et al .",
    "2003 ) , and other spectroscopically - proven associations , e.g.  grb030213/sn2003lw ( malesani et al .",
    "2004 ) , grb021211/sn2002lt ( della valle et al .",
    "2003 ) , xrf060218/sn2006aj ( campana et al .  2006b , pian et al .",

    "2006 ) and xrf080109/sn2008d ( malesani et al .",
    "2008 , modjaz et al .",
    "2008 , soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the cb model ( dd2004 ) has been applied successfully to explain all the main observed properties of long grbs and xrfs before the swift era ( e.g.  dar 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the model is summarized in @xmath5[cbmodel ] . for detailed accounts",
    "see , e.g. ,  de rjula , 2007a , b .    in this report",
    "we extend and refine our analysis of the temporal and spectral behaviour of the @xmath0-ray , x - ray and optical light curves of grbs during the prompt emission , the rapid - decay phase , and the afterglow phase .",
    "the observed prompt spectrum in the @xmath0-ray to x - ray domain is the predicted one , which is compton - dominated in the cb model ( dd2004 ) .",
    "the observed widths of the @xmath0-ray and x - ray peaks , as well as lag - times between them and their relative fluences , are in accordance with the model s predictions , if free - free absorption dominates the transparency of the cbs to ev photons in the cbs rest frame .",
    "we investigate whether or not the cb model can describe all the data in terms of only two emission mechanisms : inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation .",
    "we shall see that this simple picture , explicitly based on the predictions in ddd2002a and dd2004 , gives a straightforward and successful description of the swift grb data , at all observed energies and times .",
    "an exploding sn illuminates the progenitor s earlier ejecta , creating a _ glory _ of scattered and re - emitted light . in the cb model inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of glory photons",
    "is the origin of the prompt @xmath0/x - ray peaks , as we review in @xmath5[inverse ] .",
    "each peak is generated by a single cb emitted by the ` engine ' , the accreting compact object resulting from a core - collapse supernova event .",
    "we shall see that ics correctly describes the prompt peaks , extending even into the optical domain in xrfs in which the relevant observations are available , such as xrf 060218 .",
    "the natural explanation of the early time flares is the same as that of the stronger flares : ics of glory photons by the electrons of cbs ejected in late accretion episodes of fall - back matter on the newly formed central object .",
    "these cb emissions must correspond to a weakening activity of the engine , as the accreting material becomes scarcer .    in the cb model , from the onset of the ` plateau ' onwards , the x - ray , optical ( ddd2002a ) and radio ( ddd2003a ) afterglows",
    "are dominated by synchrotron radiation ( sr ) , the cb - model predictions for which are reviewed in @xmath5[synchrotron ] . on occasion",
    "these ags also have transient rebrightenings ( ` very late ' flares ) , two notable cases before the swift era being grb 970508 ( amati et al .",
    "1999 , galama et al .",
    "1998a ) and grb 030329 ( lipkin et al .",
    "2004 ) . during these episodes",
    ", the spectrum continues to coincide with the one predicted on the basis of the synchrotron mechanism that dominates the late ags .",
    "these very late flares are well described by encounters of cbs with density inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( ddd2002a , dd2004 ) .",
    "very late flares in the _ xuvonir _ ag may have this origin as well .    in this article",
    "we compare the predictions of the cb model and the observed x - ray and optical light curves of 33 selected grbs , which are well sampled from very early time until late time , have a relatively long follow - up with good statistics and represent well the entire diversity of swift grbs .",
    "these include the brightest of the swift grbs ( 080319b ) , the grb with the longest measured x - ray emission ( 060729 ) , a few with canonical x - ray light curves ( 050315 , 060526 , 061121 and 080320 ) with and without superimposed x - ray flares , grbs with semi - canonical light curves ( 060211a , 061110a , 070220 , 080303 , 080307 , 051021b ) and non - canonical light curves ( 061007 , 061126 , 060206 ) , and some of the allegedly most peculiar grbs ( 050319 , 050820a , 060418 , 060607a , 071010a , 061126 ) .",
    "we also compare the cb model prediction and the observed x - ray light curve of additional 12 grbs with the most rapid late - time temporal decay .    in the cb model , lgrbs and xrfs",
    "are one and the same , the general distinction being that xrfs are viewed at a larger angle relative to the direction of the approaching jet of cbs or have a relatively small lorentz factor ( dd2004 , dado et al",
    ".  2004c ) .",
    "thus we include a swift xrf of particular interest in our analysis : 060218 .",
    "its x - ray light curve is shown to be the normal x - ray light curve of a grb viewed far off axis , and not the emission from the break - out of a spherical shock wave through the stellar envelope .",
    "its optical ag at various frequencies shows , before the sn becomes dominant , a series of broad peaks between 30 ks and 60 ks after trigger , which we interpreted as the optical counterparts of the dominant prompt x - ray peak of this xrf .",
    "the expressions for an ics - generated peak at all frequencies allow us to predict the positions , magnitudes and pulse shape of these broad peaks , a gigantic extrapolation in time , radiated energy and frequency .    after submitting for publication a first version of a comparison between the cb - model predictions and swift observations ( ddd2007c ) ,",
    "we have compared many more swift data with the cb - model predictions , in order to further test its ability to predict correctly all the main properties of grb light curves .",
    "these included the rapid spectral evolution observed during the fast decay of the prompt emission in ` canonical ' grbs ( ddd2008a ) and the ` missing ag breaks ' in the ag of several grbs ( ddd2008b ) .",
    "we have also extended the cb model to describe short hard bursts ( shbs ) and confronted it with the entire data on all shbs with well - measured x - ray and/or optical afterglows ( dado & dar 2008 ) .    together with the grbs discussed in this report , we have analyzed and published cb model fits to the light curves of more than 100 lgrbs and shbs .",
    "the cb model continued to be completely successful in the confrontation of its predictions with the data .",
    "in the cb model ( e.g.  dd2004 and references therein ) _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of cbs which are ejected ( shaviv & dar , 1995 , dar & plaga , 1999 ) in  _ ordinary core - collapse _ supernova explosions , implying a normal sn kinetic energy release of a few times @xmath6 erg . ] .",
    "an accretion disk or a torus is hypothesized to be produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula  1987 ) . as observed in microquasars ( e.g.  mirabel & rodriguez  1999 , rodriguez & mirabel  1999 and references therein ) , each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , a pair of cbs made of _ ordinary - matter plasma _ with a typical baryonic number , @xmath7 are emitted with large bulk - motion lorentz factors , typically @xmath8 , in opposite directions along the rotation axis , wherefrom matter has already fallen back onto the compact object , due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the @xmath0-rays of a single pulse of a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the sn _ glory _ , the light emitted and scattered by the ` wind ' the ejecta puffed by the progenitor star continuously or in a succession of pre - sn flares after being illuminated by the progenitor s pre - supernova and sn light .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb compton up - scatter the photons of the glory to grb energies .",
    "the initial fast expansion of the cbs and the increasing transparency of the wind environment as the cbs penetrates it , result in the fast rise of grb pulses . as the cb coasts further through the sn glory , the density and temperature decrease rapidly .",
    "consequently , the energy of the up - scattered photons is continuously shifted to lower energies and their number decreases rapidly .",
    "typically , the ensuing fast decline of the prompt emission is taken over , within a couple of minutes of observer s time , by a broad - band synchrotron emission from swept - in electrons from the wind and the interstellar medium ( ism ) spiraling in the cb s enclosed magnetic field .    in the cb model",
    "there is no clear - cut _ temporal _ distinction between prompt and _",
    "after_-glow signals .",
    "there are , however , two rather distinct radiation mechanisms : inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation . for all cases",
    "we have studied , the prompt emission of @xmath0-rays , x - rays and optical light in xrfs is dominated by ics whereas in ordinary grbs , only the prompt emission of @xmath0 and x - rays is dominated by ics , while sr dominates the prompt optical emission and the broad - band afterglow emission . usually , the sr takes over the x - ray emission during the fast decay of the prompt emission or at the onset of the ` plateau ' phase .",
    "late flares appear to be dominated by sr .",
    "during the initial phase of @xmath0-ray emission in a grb , the lorentz factor @xmath0 of a cb stays put at its initial value @xmath9 , for the deceleration induced by the collisions with the ism has not yet had a significant effect ( ddd2002a , ddd2003a ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the observer s angle relative to the direction of motion of a cb .",
    "the doppler factor by which light emitted by a cb is boosted in energy is , @xmath11 where the approximation is excellent for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the emitted light is forward - collimated into a cone of characteristic opening angle @xmath14 , so that the boosted energetic radiation is observable for @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the typical initial doppler factor of a grb is : @xmath16 .",
    "the burst environment is very complex , and can only be roughly approximated . after it is ejected , the fast - expanding cb propagates through a cavity produced by the pre - supernova ejecta , and shortly encounters the previously ejected ` windy environment ' , whose density distribution is roughly @xmath17 .",
    "the initially fast - expanding cb scatters the quasi - isotropic distribution of glory light and the collimated light from the cbs themselves . ] .",
    "the glory light has a thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum @xmath18 with @xmath19 and a temperature that decreases with distance beyond a characteristic @xmath20 like @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ev .",

    "( [ grbspec ] ) , bears a striking resemblance to the band function ( band et al .",

    "simple as they are , these two mechanisms and the bursts environments generate the rich structure and variety of the light curves at all frequencies and times . * the historical distinction between prompt and afterglow phases",
    "is replaced by a physical distinction : the relative dominance of the compton or synchrotron mechanisms at different , frequency - dependent times . * the relatively narrow pulses of the @xmath0-ray signal , the somewhat wider prompt flares of x - rays , and the much wider humps sometimes seen at @xmath209 frequencies in xrfs , have a common origin .",

    "grbs are not persistent mysteries , nor ` the biggest of explosions after the big bang ' , nor a constant source of surprises , exceptions and new requirements . instead , they are well - understood and can be used as cosmological tools , to study the history of the intergalactic medium and of star formation up to large redshifts , and to locate sn explosions at a very early stage . as interpreted in the cb model ,",
    "grbs are not ` standard candles ' , their use in ` hubble - like ' analises would require further elaboration .",

    "this results in a successful description of the spectra of all primary cosmic - ray nuclei and electrons at all observed energies ( dar and de rjula  2006a ) .",
    "the cb model also predicts very simply the spectrum of the gamma background radiation and explains its directional properties ( dar & de rjula  2001a , 2006b ) .",
