    "the discovery of cometary dust trails by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( davies _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 , sykes _",
    "et al . _ 1986 ) revealed that comets emit far more dust than expected based on visual wavelength observations ( sykes and walker 1992 ) .",
    "the trails consist of large , dark particles ( in the millimeter to centimeter size range ) , and they were found to represent the principal mass loss mechanism for the comets with which they were associated . from the _ iras _ observations , it was inferred that dust trails were a phenomenon common to short - period comets in general , and that the ` dirty snowball ' of whipple ( 1950 ) was more accurately a ` frozen mudball ' ( sykes 1993 ) .",
    "even the classical ` gassy ' comet p / encke was observed to have a trail , and it was shown that the dust to gas mass ratio of the material ejected from the comet was 3.5 , as opposed to the canonical 0.1 to 1 ( sykes and walker 1992 ) .",
    "we will use the terms ` meteoroid ' and ` dust particle ' synonymously in this paper , but it should be evident from our results that the ` dust particles ' we are talking about are larger than those often referred to by observers of other comets .",
    "in fact , the ` dust particles ' are the same size as the particles that give rise to meteors when they enter the earth s atmosphere ( ceplecha 1998 ) .",
    "thus when we describe the ` encke dust trail , ' we are describing the origin of meteoroids from comet encke .",
    "comet encke is the parent body of the taurid meteor stream complex , so we infer that the ` encke dust trail ' is the set of recently - produced particles that would become a meteor stream if their orbit crossed the earth s orbit ( as the taurid meteoroids orbits now do ) . meteoroids and dust particles",
    "are ejected from comets due to pressure from sublimating ices , and after being accelerated to some terminal velocity ( @xmath9 ) , the principal forces on optically large particles are solar gravity and radiation pressure ( parameterized by the force ratio @xmath10 ) .",
    "the width of the dust trails perpendicular to the orbital plane , observed by _ iras _ , constrained @xmath9 and @xmath11 . for p",
    "/ encke , the trail spanned a @xmath12 of mean anomaly , or about 2 au of physical length .",
    "the length of a dust trail ahead of and behind the comet allows an estimate of the ages of the trails , which are typically many orbital periods of the comets ( sykes _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , sykes and walker 1992 ) .",
    "however , the relatively low angular resolution of _ iras _ limited the information that could be easily extracted from the data .",
    "frequent opportunities exist to study comets from ground - based telescopes , but low albedos and optical depths of @xmath13 make trails extremely difficult to observe at visible wavelengths . in the thermal infrared they are only available from space - based platforms .",
    "the apparition of p / encke in 1997 provided a special opportunity to study the dynamics and distributions of various size ranges of particles ejected from the nucleus , because we could see the comet from a favorable viewing geometry above its orbital plane .",
    "the favorable geometry , increased sensitivity , higher angular resolution of the _ infrared space observatory _ camera relative to _ iras _ , and proximity of encke to the earth , made the 1997 apparition of encke a prime opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and origin of cometary dust .",
    "we observed comet encke using the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; kessler _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) on july 14 , 1997 , after encke had passed perihelion on may 23 , 1997 . at the time of",
    "observation encke was at a distance @xmath14 au from the earth and @xmath15 au from the sun .",
    "it was observed from a vantage point well above the orbital plane , with the angle between the line of sight and the orbital plane being @xmath16 .",
    "the phase angle ( sun - encke - earth ) was @xmath17 for this observation .",
    "figure  [ enckeday ] shows the locations of encke and earth in their orbits at the time of observation . for reference",
    ", encke s orbit has semimajor axis 2.21 au , eccentricity 0.85 , and inclination @xmath18 .    for our observations",
    ", we used the mid - infrared camera isocam ( cesarsky _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) with the @xmath19 pixel - field - of - view lens and the widest filter ( lw10 , nominal wavelength 11.5 @xmath20 m , range 815 @xmath20 m ) .",
    "isocam consists of a @xmath21 detector array , so in this configuration the instantaneous field of view is @xmath22 .",
    "the ideal diffraction limit is @xmath23 , approximately the same as the pixel size , so a typical point source will have a full width at half maximum of less than 2 pixels .",
    "owing to its rapid motion ( @xmath24/hr ) and large angular size ( @xmath25 ) , comet encke was a challenging target for _ iso _ observations .",
    "we devised a strategy that allowed us to cover a large area with high sensitivity , without allowing the comet to smear or the stars to trail . to do this",
    ", we made a series of pointed observations , taking 11 exposures of 2.1 sec duration at each position .",
    "encke s motion during the 23 sec spent at each position is less than half a pixel , so each set of 11 frames can be coadded without smearing the comet . to build a mosaic large enough to show extended features , we pointed the telescope in a @xmath26 raster , with step sizes of @xmath27 , oriented perpendicular to the comet s motion .",
    "the raster leg length was chosen to be long enough to cover the desired area , yet fast enough that the comet could not move more than half of the isocam field of view during a raster leg .",
    "this ensures that we saw the comet on two raster legs .",
    "the spacing between raster legs was chosen to be equal to the motion of the comet during an individual raster leg .",
    "this is the optimal strategy for covering the widest possible area in comet - centered coordinates , while maintaining enough overlap between frames to allow accurate removal of the pixel - to - pixel gain variations .",
    "because the _ iso _ operation system did not allow raster observations of moving targets , we negotiated with the _ iso _ team for an observing date , close to encke s passage near the earth , that fit within the _ iso _ schedule and viewing constraints . for each of the possible observing dates , we calculated the position and orientation of motion of encke for that observing date , and we specified a window for scheduling .",
    "the observations spanned the period between 00:07 and 02:03 ut .",
    "if the observation had been scheduled earlier or later , part or all of the desired field would have been missed .",
    "( unfortunately , the other comet in this observing program , 81p / wild 2 , was missed entirely . )",
    "because the encke observation took place exactly at the time for which we calculated the ephemeris , encke is centered in the final map . in celestial coordinates ,",
    "the map covers @xmath28 , and in cometocentric coordinates , the map covers @xmath29 .",
    "the set of 2541 exposures were reduced as follows .",
    "first , cosmic rays were identified using a running median on the time history of the brightness seen by each pixel . for each cosmic ray ,",
    "the affected pixel was flagged for 4 exposures beginning with the cosmic ray event ; this helps remove pixels affected by transient gain variations induced by the cosmic ray . then the dark current was subtracted from each exposure using a library image of the dark current from the routine calibration observations",
    ". then the time history of each pixel was corrected for the transient gain response , by deconvolving the the time series from the response curve , which consists of a fast response to 60% of a brightness change followed by a slower response to the remaining 40% with a time constant @xmath30 sec for a brightness @xmath31 mjy  sr@xmath32 ; the transient corrections make only small changes to the image because the comet and zodiacal light were very bright for this observation ( cf .",
    "coulais and abergel 1999 ) .",
    "the 10 exposures at each position for which the telescope was not slewing were coadded to give 242 images . the pixel - to - pixel gain response and the optical vignetting were corrected by dividing each frame by a flat - field image , constructed from the median of all images excluding images taken within @xmath33 of the comet nucleus .",
    "figure  [ isoshift ] shows a mosaic of the isocam images in the rest frame of comet encke .",
    "each of the 242 images was shifted to match the comet s motion relative to its position halfway through the observation .",
    "therefore , this image simulates a ` snapshot ' of the comet on july 14 , 1997 at 01:00 ut . in fig .",
    "[ isoshift ] , stars appear as a pair of point sources spread along the direction of the comet s motion ( roughly right to left ) .",
    "the spacing between the star images depends on the interval between crossings of the star during the raster ( which was performed with legs of alternating direction ) .",
    "several structures can be distinguished in our isocam observation of comet encke .",
    "figure  [ spikefig ] shows an unsharp - masked version of the isocam image , with several features labeled .",
    "the structures include a coma , consisting of a lobe extending to the south and a spike extending to the northwest , and a thin , linear trail that stretches across the image , running directly through the nucleus from the upper right ( following the comet ) to the lower left ( leading the comet ) .",
    "the trail is brighter following the comet than leading , and there is a steeper gradient of brightness with distance leading the comet than following the comet .",
    "the vertical profile of the trail is also somewhat different for the portions of the trail leading and following the comet .",
    "figure  [ trailprof_encke ] shows two perpendicular brightness profiles of the dust trail .",
    "the two cuts are at angular separations of @xmath34 from the nucleus , corresponding to a separation from the nucleus by an orbital mean anomaly of @xmath35 and a physical distance of approximately @xmath36 km .",
    "the profile leading the comet is consistent with a single gaussian component , while the profile following the comet is very different .",
    "in addition to a nearly gaussian core ( with width similar to that of the trail ahead of the comet ) , there is a wider , underlying component , as well as significant emission from the _ tail _ , which curves over the trail behind the comet .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we fit the trail as the sum of two gaussian components , labeled ` core ' and ` skirt ' in fig .",
    "[ trailprof_encke ] .",
    "table  [ proftab ] shows the parameters of gaussian fits to the brightness profiles .",
    "the optical depth was calculated for the peak brightness through the trail : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the planck function .",
    "we assume a temperature @xmath39  k , based on the time of the isophot spectrophotometry of the coma ( lisse et al . 2000 ) . for reference , @xmath40 mjy  sr@xmath32 at 11.7 @xmath20 m ( the center of the response curve for the lw10 filter ) .",
    "as discussed below , the particles in the dust trail are likely to be larger than those in the coma and tail .",
    "but even the coma and tail particles appear to be large enough that they emit as greybodies : their temperature is only 4% warmer than expected for rapidly - rotating grains larger than 10 @xmath20 m radius , and they have a grey emissivity even out to 100 @xmath20 m wavelength ( lisse et al . 2000 ) .",
    "very large grains may preserve a day - night temperature difference across their surface , which could elevate the temperature of the trail particles somewhat .",
    "sykes and walker ( 1992 ) determined that encke trail particles had temperatures @xmath41% in excess of a greybody .",
    "the temperature excess is likely to be less than 15 k , meaning our optical depths are unlikely to be wrong by more than 25% .",

    ", we use the _ cobe_/dirbe zodiacal light model ( kelsall et al . 1998 ) and the isocam filter transmission ( prault et al . 1994 ) to estimate the zodiacal light in our filter and on our observing date to be @xmath54 mjy  sr@xmath32 . because our observation was at a relatively low galactic latitude",
    ", we also expect some emission from the diffuse interstellar medium . using the dirbe - corrected _",
    "iras _ dust template of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to get the interstellar surface brightness at 100 @xmath20 m wavelength , and a nominal interstellar dust spectrum ( reach and boulanger 1998 ) , we estimate the brightness of interstellar dust in our image to be @xmath55 mjy  sr@xmath32 .",
    "thus the total predicted background for our image is @xmath56 mjy  sr@xmath32 .",
    "the faint regions in our image , near the bottom , have a brightness of @xmath57 mjy  sr@xmath32 , which is entirely consistent with the predicted background .",
    "therefore , it appears that our image does extend far enough to catch the southern edge of the emission from encke dust .",
    "the dust trail clearly extends off the image toward the west , and",

    "figure  [ encke_nuc ] shows a close - up of the inner coma made using data from a single raster leg , with logarithmic contours .",
    "the individual pixel that pointed at the nucleus was saturated , meaning that the brightness of the @xmath58  km area centered on the nucleus can not be determined .",
    "an approximate fit to the coma surface brightness profile between @xmath19 ( 1100 km ) and @xmath59 ( 65,000 km ) is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is angular distance from the nucleus .",
    "note that the coma is highly asymmetric at @xmath62 , and this equation only gives the azimuthally - averaged falloff of brightness with distance from the nucleus .",
    "( also , the coma profile flattens close to the nucleus ; a better fit to the coma from @xmath63 ( 11,000 km ) outward has a radial power - law exponent of -1.15 . )",

    "the dust coma of encke was very bright , with an integrated flux within @xmath59 ( 65,000 km ) diameter of 40 jy .",
    "the radius of the nucleus of p / encke was recently measured by fernandez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using eso and hst observations ; they found @xmath66 km . using our observations combined with the isophot observations",
    ", we can make an independent estimate of the size of the nucleus .",
    "the single isocam pixel containing the nucleus was saturated , which means that the flux in that pixel exceeded 2 jy . if we extrapolate the coma surface brightness inward using eq .",
    "[ eg : coma ] , the coma contributes about 0.9 jy to the central pixel . the remaining @xmath67 jy / pixel could be due to the nucleus or to enhanced inner coma brightness ( relative to our extrapolation ) . for a point source",
    ", about half of the flux falls in the central pixel ( based on integrating the isocam point spread function ; okumura 1998 ) , so the lower limit to encke s flux is 2 jy .",
    "an upper bound on the nuclear flux is set by an unsaturated measurement of the flux in a @xmath68 aperture using isophot ( lisse _ et al .",
    "interpolating between the isophot 10 @xmath20 m and 12.8 @xmath20 m fluxes , the flux at our wavelength would be 19 jy .",
    "integrating our isocam image over a @xmath68 diameter aperture centered on the nucleus ( but excluding the central , saturated pixel ) , the flux is 21 jy . from controlled observations of calibration stars ,",
    "the relative calibration between isocam and isophot is accurate to @xmath69% ( moneti 1998 ) ; also , the observations themselves have @xmath69% uncertainties .",
    "therefore the nuclear flux from the isophot - isocam difference is @xmath70 jy , which we can interpret as an upper limit of 4 jy .",
    "the approximate confidence interval of nuclear fluxes , 24 jy , constrains the radius of p / encke as follows . if the nucleus were a absorbing , rapidly - rotating sphere with a subsolar latitude of zero , its equatorial temperature would be 260 k , and the radius must be in the range 1.53 km .",
    "if the nucleus were a slow - rotating sphere with a single temperature on the sunlit hemisphere and zero on the other , the sunlit hemisphere temperature would be 307 k , and the radius would be in the range 12 km .",
    "thus the radius of p / encke must be in the range 13 km .",
    "this compares well with the direct radar measurement of encke s radius , which yielded a confidence interval 0.53.8 km ( kamoun _ et al .",
    "our limit is similar to previous limits determined from infrared and optical observations ( campins 1988 ; gehrz _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; luu and jewitt 1990 ; fernandez 2000 ) .",
    "space - based infrared observations of short - period comets reveal a more extensive dust environment than what is easily observable from ground - based telescopes . to understand the origin of this extended dust environment , we need to compare it to predictions for particles of a given ejection velocity ( @xmath9 ) and size ( parameterized by @xmath11 ) . a dynamical analysis of cometary particles yields _ only _ @xmath11 and @xmath9 , from which may be inferred the size ( and mass )",
    "assuming that the particles are spherical with radius @xmath71 ( @xmath20 m ) and mass density of @xmath72 ( g  @xmath8 ) , and they are large compared to the wavelength of sunlight ( _ i.e. _ @xmath73 ) , then @xmath74 where @xmath75 g  @xmath76 ( burns et al . 1979 ) .",
    "note that the particles size for a given @xmath11 is rather uncertain , because it depends on the particles mass density and geometry . collected interplanetary dust particles and chondritic meteorites appear rather solid , with @xmath77 ( corrigan et al .",
    "1997 ) , but cometary dust may be rather porous and irregular ( cf .",
    "lien 1992 ) .    if the ejection velocity is assumed to be zero , then lines of constant @xmath11 ( syndynes ) can be used to determine the range of @xmath11s ejected by a comet .",
    "figure  [ syndynes ] shows the syndynes overlaid on a greyscale version of the isocam image .",
    "this figure can be used to define the canonical three main parts of the comet : coma , tail , and trail .",
    "once the dust is ejected it will end up in either the tail or the trail , and the ` dust coma ' is only a transition region .",
    "we consider the dust coma to be a roughly spherical region around the nucleus whose radius is equal to the distance at which sunward emitted dust with intermediate values of @xmath11 ` turns around ' in the reference frame of the comet due to radiation pressure . for our observations of comet encke , the ` dust coma ' is the peanut - shaped region of intense emission with a diameter of about @xmath78 ( @xmath79 km ) centered on the nucleus .",
    "dust with larger values of @xmath11 would form a comet tail ; particles ejected at perihelion will have unbound orbits if @xmath80 ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) , which means @xmath81 for encke .",
    "based on figure  [ syndynes ] and the more detailed dynamical models presented below , there is no evidence for a dust tail due to small particles ( less than 200 @xmath20 m in radius ) in comet encke .",
    "the syndynes for particles with very small @xmath82 are not shown in fig .",
    "[ syndynes ] because they crowd into the dust trail , as is found in the simulations below .",
    "to better understand the observed shapes of the coma and trail , we created a series of simulations using a monte carlo dynamical model ( cf .",
    "campins et al .",
    "our simulations assume a differential size distribution @xmath83 ranging from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , with @xmath86 as the initial guess .",
    "the ejection velocity depends on size and heliocentric distance as @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "whipple 1951 ) .",
    "( 1998 ) found that this velocity distribution reproduced the cobe observations of c / austin , c / levy , and c / okazaki - levy - rudenko . over the range of @xmath11s used in the simulations , our ejection velocities ( eq .  [ velbeta ] )",
    "reproduce sekanina s ejection velocities ( 1988a , b ) to within 10% .",
    "see f7.jpg    figure  [ figthree ] shows the results of three simulations .",
    "each panel shows the number of particles per pixel weighted by the time a particle spends in that pixel .",
    "the images were smoothed to @xmath88 resolution to improve their appearance .",
    "the first simulation , shown in panel figure  [ figthree]a , assumes isotropic emission over the sunlit hemisphere . the dust production rate scales with heliocentric distance as @xmath89 , with dust ejection beginning at aphelion ( @xmath90 au ; october 1995 ) .",
    "the isotropic emission model in figure  [ figthree]a fails to reproduce any of the coma structure observed in our isocam image .",
    "this confirms the previous work that demonstrated that encke s mass loss is anisotropic , based on the non - gravitational forces and orientation of the visible fan - like tail ( sekanina 1986 , 1988a , b ) , that showed that the visual appearance of encke s fan - like dust tail could be understood in terms of a vents on the northern and southern hemispheres of a rotating and precessing nucleus .",
    "the isotropic emission model with smooth @xmath91 also fails to reproduce the observed time - variation of the oh production rate ( ahearn et al .",
    "an active area on the northern hemisphere was suggested by fanale and salvail ( 1984 ) to explain observed variations in oh production , and by newburn and spinrad ( 1985 ) to explain an anomalous decrease in dust loading of the coma near perihelion .",
    "the second simulation , shown in figure  [ figthree]b , assumes emission from a single jet at a latitude of @xmath92 with the north pole pointing at at ra=102.8@xmath93 , dec=32.6@xmath93 .",
    "this polar orientation corresponds to an obliquity of nearly @xmath12 , so that encke s pole is in its orbital plane .",
    "the rate of particle ejection from the jet was proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of the sun .",
    "a rotational period of 24 hours is used in this analysis .",
    "this period differs from the 15 hours found by luu and jewitt ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , our results are completely insensitive to rotational periods of less than a few days , because any rotational structure is smoothed out by variations in @xmath11 and the low ejection velocities . the single - jet , rotating model in figure  [ figthree]b includes dust emission occurring since the most recent aphelion ( october 1995 ) .",
    "this model reproduces the gross features of the iso ) .",
    "however , the extent of the trail is not reproduced .",
    "figure  [ figthree]c shows the same model as figure  [ figthree]b , but with dust ejection beginning at the aphelion of the _ previous _ apparition ( june 1992 ) .",
    "clearly , reproducing all of the observed structures requires not only that the dust is ejected anisotropically , but also that the dust is emitted over multiple orbits .    to better understand the types of particles that give rise to the dust coma and trail , we repeated the rotating jet model used in figure  [ figthree]b for particles in four separate decades of @xmath11 : @xmath84@xmath94 ; @xmath94@xmath95 ; @xmath95@xmath96 ; and @xmath96@xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ figfour ] shows the simulated images for particles in these four size ranges .",
    "the isocam image must be produced by particles with @xmath97 , because the higher-@xmath11 particles create a diffuse coma that does not look at all like the one we observed .",
    "the bright lobe of emission extending @xmath98 to the southwest of the nucleus , and the ` spike ' to the northwest , are due to the projection of the expanding material from the jet .",
    "the ` gap ' in the images for intermediate-@xmath11 particles is created when the jet is pointed away from the sun , near perihelion , due to the tilt of encke s rotational pole  that is , when it becomes ` winter ' for the jet ( late april 1997 ) .",
    "the ` turn - around ' seen coming from the ` spike ' is due to the first material ejected just after the comet turned on again during this most recent apparition ( mid june 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ enckeday ] shows the locations of encke and earth for these events .",
    "all of the dust observed in these simulations eventually ends up in the dust trail of comet encke .",
    "see f8.jpg    only the oldest and largest particles from our simulation of the present apparition of encke are close to joining the dust trail .",
    "thus , we conclude that the core of the dust trail contains mostly particles emitted during _",
    "previous _ apparitions . to reproduce the entire dust trail as seen in our image , we ran the same model as figure  [ figthree]c for the same 4 particle size ranges as figure  [ figfour ]",
    ". dust production begins in june 1992 , at the aphelion of the _ previous _ apparition .",
    "figure  [ figfive ] shows a number of important features .",
    "first , even including particles from the previous apparition , particles with @xmath5 do not contribute significantly to the isocam image .",
    "second , figure  [ figfive ] shows that the particles that extend off the northwest edge of the isocam image most likely have intermediate size : @xmath99 .",
    "third , the core of the dust trail is produced by very large particles .",

    "[ figfive]c is @xmath100 , while the width of the trail in fig .",
    "[ figfive]d is @xmath101 .",
    "[ figfive]d is a very good match to the ` core ' of the dust trail in figure  [ trailprof_encke ] and table  [ proftab ] ; therefore , the core of the dust trail is produced by particles with @xmath102 .",
    "the ` skirt ' of the dust trail , which appears only trailing the nucleus , is produced by particles with a range of sizes , with a typical value @xmath103 .",
    "see f9.jpg    the isocam image shows , for the first time , cometary trail material _ before _",
    "it actually enters into the trail . in principle , this allows us to determine the trail mass injection rate unequivocally once we have the correct rotational and jet model .",
    "unfortunately , the model presented in figure  [ figthree ] is not unique .",
    "figure  [ figsix ] shows the simulation of figure  [ figthree]c along with a simulation based on sekanina s rotational model ( two jets with latitudes of @xmath104 and @xmath105 and a pole position of ra@xmath106 , dec@xmath107 which corresponds to an obliquity of @xmath108 ) . in the sekanina model ,",
    "the nw ` spike ' is created solely by the @xmath104 jet , which turns off just before perihelion , and the southern lobe is created solely by the @xmath105 jet . in our model",
    "both features are created by the same jet .",
    "sekanina s analysis assumed that the bisection of the observed visible emission fan indicates the instantaneous projection of the spin vector .",
    "this assumption is only correct if the dust is relatively ` young . '",
    "if the fan is created by particles with @xmath97 , as suggested by our results , then the youngest dust particle would be over 1 month old at the outer edge of the wedge .",
    "since most of the observations were made around perihelion , there can exist a large change in the projection of the spin axis over the course of 1 month , in which case the instantaneous projection of the spin axis will _ not _ coincide with the bisection of the observed dust wedge .",
    "therefore it is very difficult to make an accurate measurement of the orientation of the rotational pole .",
    "neither our model nor sekanina s model are perfectly matched to the observations .",
    "however , given the relatively large phase space of possible solutions , it is interesting that such simple models can match the isocam observations as well as they do . taken together , our work and that of sekanina show that a high obliquity is required to interpret both infrared and optical observations of dust from encke .",
    "see f10.jpg      using the dynamical simulations , we constrained the particle sizes through their force ratio @xmath11 ( eq .  [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "each particle was assigned a surface brightness equal to a planck function at @xmath39  k ( see above ) multiplied by the solid angle of the particle as seen from earth .",
    "then the production rate and @xmath11 distribution were adjusted in order to reproduce the observed surface brightness .",
    "the production rate was adjusted by making simulations for particles ejected over short intervals and determining how their contributions add to make the total image .",
    "the initial guess for the production rate was determined by choosing a narrow range of @xmath11 and calculating the surface brightness of dust ejected over a small range of heliocentric distance . dividing the observed image by the initial - guess simulation yields an estimate of the heliocentric dust production rate .",
    "the @xmath11 distribution was also adjusted by making simulations for size ranges and determining how their relative contributions add to make the total image .",
    "the initial guess for the @xmath11 distribution was obtained by choosing a heliocentric distance where there is a good separation between the effects of @xmath11 and production rate , then calculating a simulated image for a small range of @xmath11 at that heliocentric distance .",
    "these adjustments were made step by step , and our final solution is not unique ; for example , the orientation of the pole and the jet are correlated with the production rate . however , the salient features of the model are robust .",
    "the simulations were normalized by the total number of particles emitted over the simulation multiplied by the production rate and @xmath11 distribution functions .",
    "because the model assumes a single jet which turns on and off with season , the resultant production rate is a complex function of heliocentric distance .",
    "we found the @xmath11-distribution index from equation  [ sizedist ] to have a value @xmath109 for the range @xmath110 , with no particles with larger @xmath11 .",
    "this is not a unique solution for the size distribution , and a much more exhaustive modeling effort would be able to determine the size distribution in more detail  including the higher-@xmath11 particles . for our size distribution ,",
    "both the mass and the surface area are in relatively large particles .",
    "the mass is in the very largest particles and the area is in particles with @xmath111 .",
    "the isocam observations and our model clearly shows a paucity of the smallest particles ( with high @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is not due to physical optics alone , which predicts that particles with @xmath112 will not emit efficiently . for our observation @xmath113  @xmath20 m , so only particles smaller than 2 @xmath20 m radius , or @xmath114 , will emit inefficiently due to physical optics .",
    "but we find a paucity of particles with @xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath115 @xmath20 m . if physical optics were the reason for the observed lack of high-@xmath11 particles , then the relation between size and @xmath11 would have to be modified drastically .",
    "alternatively , there could be a real lower limit to the size of particles ejected from encke . in either case ,",
    "our inferred @xmath11 distribution differs significantly from those found for other comets such as p / halley , for which the mass distribution is dominated by large particles while the surface area ( and the infrared emission ) is dominated by much smaller particles ( mcdonnell et al .",
    "we find that the infrared emission from p / encke is dominated relatively large particles , so the size distribution for encke must be more shallow than that for halley .    using the numerical simulations that best match the isocam image",
    ", we find that the total mass emitted since aphelion is within the range 26@xmath6 g ( assuming particles with mass density @xmath116 g  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the range in values comes from the different @xmath11 distributions that produced acceptable matches to the observed surface brightness of the comet .",
    "the model we present here is not unique , and it could be improved by optimizing the parameter values to match the observations in detail . therefore , our derived mass loss rate remains uncertain , although the factor of 3 range is our best estimate .    to estimate the contribution to the trail from the previous apparition , we ran the numerical model for approximately 1.5 orbits , starting from the aphelion before the previous apparition . in the core of the trail ,",
    "the model brightness is only about 10% of the observed brightness .",
    "this suggests the trail is at least 10 orbits old , which is consistent with the trail age estimated from its total extent ( sykes and walker 1992 ) .",
    "the mass of the trail is therefore at least 26 @xmath117 g , comparable to the estimate of @xmath118 g estimated from the _ iras _ observations ( sykes and walker 1992 ) .    as a check , a model - independent estimate for the mass of the portion of the dust trail present in the _ iso _ image can be measured from the observables as follows .",
    "if we assume the trail is a cylinder oriented perpendicular to the line of sight , with cross - sectional angular diameter @xmath119 and length @xmath120 , the distance from the earth is @xmath121 , particle density is @xmath72 , and the optical depth through the trail is @xmath122 , then @xmath123 where @xmath71 is the particle radius in the dust trail .",
    "this equation assumes that both the mass and emitting surface area are produced by large particles of effective size @xmath71 . because only the combination @xmath124 determines the trail mass , and the dynamics constrain @xmath125 , the masses that we derive here are independent of the mass density @xmath72 of the particles , and the masses are independent of whether the particles are fluffy or compact .",
    "we can set a generous upper limit @xmath126 by comparing the dynamical simulations to the morphology of the dust trail and coma .",
    "using the brightness profile fit from table  [ proftab ] we find a trail mass within our image @xmath127  g , with comparable amounts coming from the core and skirt .",
    "this trail mass is a drastic underestimate for at least three reasons .",
    "first , the lower limit to @xmath11 determined from the dynamical simulations is far form the typical values that create the observed dust trail ; the particles form previous apparitions are in the core of the trail and can have @xmath11s that are more than an order of magnitude lower .",
    "second , even if @xmath128 particles were to dominate the brightness , larger particles would also exist and could dominate the total dust mass if the size distribution is at least as shallow as was observed for p / halley ( mcdonnell et al .",
    "third , it is clear that the trail extends off the edge of the isocam image . using the _ iras _ observations , sykes and walker ( 1992 ) found the encke dust trail extends fully @xmath12 of mean anomaly relative to the nucleus . at the time of the _ iras _ observation , this corresponded to a length of 2 au , and at the time of our observation , the same mean anomaly",
    "would correspond to a length of 5.5 au along the orbit .",
    "our iso observation covered only 0.002 au of the comet s orbit .",
    "the actual mass of the encke dust trail is at least an order of magnitude larger that our limit just due to this affect .",
    "these arguments suggest the trail mass is at least @xmath129 g , which is consistent with the results of our numerical simulations and provides a sanity check .",
    "in november 2003 , the contour spacecraft is scheduled to fly within 200 km of encke ( veverka 1999 ) . at this time",
    "the comet will be at heliocentric and geocentric distances similar to those when our isocam observations were made . using a color temperature of 270 k , as measured measured by isophot ( lisse et al .",
    "2000 ) , the optical depth at an impact parameter 200  km is @xmath130 . for spherical particles of a single size , the mass of particles encountered by a spacecraft ( with area @xmath131 ) is @xmath132 the encountered mass is relatively insensitive to assumptions about the particle properties ; in particular , it is independent of the mass density ( hence , fluffiness ) of the particles .",
    "the number of particles encountered by the spacecraft is @xmath133 which is sensitive to particle density as well as @xmath11 . using the upper limit @xmath0 for coma particles , we find that a 10 m@xmath134 spacecraft will encounter @xmath135 g of cometary particles during its traverse",
    ". the expected number of particles encountered with @xmath0 is @xmath136 .    using the size distribution from the numerical simulations ( eq .  [ sizedist ] ) , the encountered mass increases relative to this lower limit to @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the @xmath11 of the largest particle ( which dominates the mass ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the mass of cometary particles encountered is @xmath142 g. larger particles exist , but their spatial distribution is more confined .",
    "thus , to make an accurate assessment of the impact hazard , one would need to compare the spacecraft trajetory and the particle distribution as a function of both particle size and position in the coma .",
    "for comparison , the dust detectors on the giotto spaceprobe passing through the coma of comet halley in 1986 detected only 0.01 g , though an estimated total mass of @xmath143 g penetrated the dust shields ( mcdonnell et al .",
    "1986 ) , at a distance of 2,200 km .",
    "also , several very large particles ( 150 mg each ) must have impacted the giotto spacecraft to cause the observed attitude shifts ( curdt and keller 1990 ) . in the dust trail core",
    ", there are relatively fewer particles than in the coma , but they are larger . at high flyby velocities of tens of kilometers per second , such large particles near the comet could represent a significant hazard to a spacecraft . using the trail optical depth of @xmath144 and an upper - limit to @xmath82",
    ", there is @xmath145% chance of a spacecraft with an area of 10 m@xmath134 hitting a trail particle , but each particle is potentially catastrophic .",
    "the total mass of particles ejected by encke in its 1997 apparition is 26 @xmath6 g. dividing the mass of the nucleus ( using @xmath146 km [ fernandez et al .",
    "2000 ] and a nuclear mass density @xmath7 in g  @xmath8 ) by the mass production we infer for the 1997 apparition , the fraction of encke s mass that was lost in the 1997 apparition is @xmath147 for comparison , in his classic papers , whipple ( 1950 , 1951 ) found that the non - gravitational forces observed on comet encke s orbit could be produced by mass loss at a ( recent ) rate of @xmath148 , with certain assumptions about the nature of the mass loss .",
    "our inferred mass loss rate is only smaller by a factor of few , which is a remarkable confirmation of the general principle of whipple s comet model , in which the mass loss rate depends on the velocity of the emitted particles and their angular distribution ( which determines the direction of the net momentum carried away by the emitted material ) .",
    "a modern version of this model takes into account that the mass loss occurs primarily from small regions ( ` jets ' ) whose illumination depends on season ( sekanina 1986 , 1988a ) .",
    "further , a modern model should take into account that most of the mass of comet encke is lost in solids as opposed to gas , so there is a component of the non - gravitational force due to the solids that could be somewhat different from that of the gas .",
    "if the dust is lost through the same jets as the gas , as appears to be the case from an analysis of the inner coma of p / halley ( reitsema 1989 ) , then the only effect of our new dust - to - gas estimate is to increase the amount of mass lost per unit ice sublimation .",
    "the non - gravitational acceleration , which is the observable quantity , depends only on @xmath149 .",
    "thus the main effect of increasing mass loss rate by a factor of 1030 times the gas mass loss rate is to increase the mass ( and density ) of the nucleus as inferred from non - gravitational forces .",
    "the dust mass loss rate we infer from the dust trail observations is indeed significantly larger than the gas mass loss rate .",
    "et al . ( 1985 ) summarized observations the oh production along encke s orbit , and sekanina ( 1986 ) provide a convenient fit .",
    "the total mass of sublimating h@xmath150o is @xmath151  g / orbit .",
    "thus the dust - to - gas ratio for comet encke s mass loss is @xmath15230 .",
    "clearly our estimate is much larger than the dust - to - gas mass ratios normally inferred for comets based on optical observations .",
    "the fraction of the mass loss occurring in non - volatile form is 9197% . for comparison , whipple ( 1955 )",
    "used 20% as the fraction of mass lost in non - volatile , meteoric , material .",
    "based on the p / halley encounter data from _ giotto _ , the dust - to - gas mass ratio was found to be @xmath153 ( mcdonnell et al . 1991 ) .",
    "based on the _ iras _ dust trail observations , sykes & walker ( 1992 ) found a dust - to - gas ratio of 3.5 for encke .",
    "in fact their dust mass loss loss rate is @xmath154 g / orbit , consistent with the result of this paper , and the gas mass loss rate was taken from an average of historical visual wavelength observations ( kresk and kreskov 1990 ) .",
    "if encke continues to lose mass at this rate , its remaining lifetime before shedding essentially its entire mass is 300010,000 @xmath7 yr .",
    "since encke is presently in a dynamically stable orbit , it appears that mass loss will be its cause of death unless the mass loss is somehow quenched in the next few millenia .",
    "if the mass is lost as a uniform layer over the surface , then the fractional decrease in surface area of the nucleus per orbit is @xmath155 , which would lead to a reduction in nuclear magnitude by 0.00020.0006 @xmath156 mag / orbit .",
    "this decrease is significantly less than the average 0.01 mag / orbit secular decrease in comet brightnesses inferred by kresk and kreskov ( 1990 ) , and it is far smaller than the aging of 0.09 mag / orbit estimated by ferrin and gil ( 1988 ) .",
    "these conflicts should not be surprising , as the coma brightness is likely a nonlinear function of the nuclear surface area , and the derivation of fading from historical observations is exceptionally difficult . as another application of the mass loss rate",
    ", we can estimate the decrease in the nuclear radius with time . again assuming the mass is lost as a sheet from the upper crust of the nucleus , the fractional decrease in nuclear radius per orbit is @xmath157 , leading to a change of radius of 0.3 - 0.9 m / orbit .",
    "if encke is losing mass like halley , via jets rather than erosion of the entire surface layer , then the jets must either be very wide or they must evolve from place to place on the surface , lest they become so deep that sunlight could not illuminate them .",
    "the isocam image of the near - nucleus region of p / encke reveals a widespread region with dust having two principal spatial components : coma and trail .",
    "there is no evidence of a tail composed of particles with @xmath158 ( or radius @xmath159 @xmath20 m , with the density @xmath72 in g  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the dust structures that are observed within the isocam image require a high obliquity rotational axis and one or more jets .",
    "the core of the observed dust trail is dominated by material ejected during previous apparitions of comet encke ; particles from the current apparition particles have not had enough time to spread into the trail .",
    "the dust trail near the nucleus ( distinguished from the trail well away from the nucleus as observed by iras ) appears to have a broad component and a narrow component which tracks the comet s orbit .",
    "the components are ` fed ' by the southern lobe of the coma , which consists mainly of particles with @xmath160 ( 500 @xmath20m5 cm ) and a nw ` spike . '",
    "particles with @xmath161 ( 5 mm ) appear to be the delimiter between broad and narrow trail components , with all particles larger than 5 mm ( @xmath126 ) ending up in the narrow portion of the trail .",
    "the broad wings of the trail are composed of particles with @xmath162 .",
    "this result is consistent with the maximum beta of @xmath163 found in p / tempel 2 dust trail ( sykes _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) suggesting that the size distributions of large particles may be similar from comet to comet .",
    "the dynamical result that p / encke s dust mass loss is dominated by the emission of large particles is consistent with the non - detection of a silicate feature from isophot observations taken 4 days later ( lisse _ et al .",
    "in addition , little or no 10 @xmath20 m silicate feature was detected during the 1987 apparition , when the inner coma of the comet was observed at its brightest , close to perihelion ( gehrz _ et al .",
    "the lack of a silicate feature , however , does not mean that silicate particles are necessarily absent .",
    "rather , gehrz _ et al .",
    "_ conclude that the particles are large enough ( @xmath164 @xmath20 m ) that their emission spectrum does not contain bright 10 @xmath20 m ( or 20 @xmath20 m ) spectral features .",
    "the broad - band spectrophotometry both from the 1987 ( gehrz _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) and the 1997 ( lisse _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) apparitions indicates that the temperature of the grains in the coma is similar to that expected for rapidly rotating greybodies . because the coma emission spectrum appears similar to that of a greybody out to wavelengths @xmath165 @xmath20 m , lisse _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) conclude that the particles must be larger than 15 @xmath20 m in radius .",
    "thus , dynamical and spectroscopic evidence all point strongly to a coma dominated by at least mid - sized grains .",
    "this distinguishes encke from new comets such as c / hale - bopp , which evidences fragmentation of coma dust and generating a significant high-@xmath11 particle population .",
    "the dominance of large particles is even more extreme for p / encke than it is for p / halley ( mcdonnell et al .",
    "1991 ; fulle et al . 1995 ) and p / grigg - skjellerup ( mcdonnell et al . 1993 ) , for which _ in situ _ observations showed the total mass is dominated by large particles , with mass @xmath166  g or @xmath167 @xmath20 m .    comparing the numerical simulations to the observations , we find the total mass of particles ejected by encke in its 1997 apparition is 26 @xmath6 g. most of the particles from the 1997 apparition are in the extended dust coma around the comet , and all of these particles eventually end up in the dust trail .",
    "most of the dust trail in our image consists of particles from previous apparitions . comparing the observed surface brightness of the dust trail to a numerical simulation for 1.5 orbits , and considering the total length of the dust trail ( sykes and walker 1992 )",
    ", we infer that the trail is at least 10 orbits old .",
    "therefore the total mass of the trail is at least 26 @xmath117 g. dividing the mass of the nucleus ( using @xmath146 km",
    "[ fernandez et al . 2000 ] and a nuclear mass density @xmath7 in g  @xmath8 ) by the mass production we infer for the 1997 apparition , the remaining lifetime of comet encke is 300010,000 @xmath7 yr . the decrease in surface area of the nucleus per orbit is approximately ( 0.7 - 2)/@xmath7 % per century , so it will gradually fade .",
    "therefore , we are witnessing the final life stages of encke , before it eventually disintegrates into a meteoroid stream or becomes inactive .",
    "we thank russ walker for encouraging us to observe comet encke with _ iso _ and for many useful discussions during this project .",
