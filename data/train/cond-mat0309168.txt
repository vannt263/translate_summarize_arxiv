    "the central principle of the composite fermion theory is that interacting electrons at filling factor @xmath4 minimize their interaction energy by transforming into weakly interacting composite fermions . the composite fermions experience an effective magnetic field , and",
    "have a filling factor @xmath5 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related by @xmath6 , with the even integer @xmath7 denoting the vorticity of the composite fermion .",
    "the formation of composite fermions leads to a profound reorganization of the low energy hilbert space of interacting electrons .",
    "in particular , a gap opens up at @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an integer , which immediately explains the fqhe of electrons at @xmath10 as the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe)@xcite of composite fermions .",
    "it is then natural to describe the region between @xmath11 in terms of a cf state for which @xmath9 cf levels are fully occupied and the @xmath12 level is partially occupied .",
    "( [ fig0 ] ) displays the physical picture in the range @xmath13 .",
    "briefly , our method for calculating the low energy spectrum is as follows .",
    "we will denote the total number of composite fermions ( which is the same as the total number of electrons ) by @xmath14 , the cf filling factor by @xmath15 , and the number of composite fermions in the topmost partially occupied level by @xmath16 .",
    "we take all basis states of _ electrons _ at filling @xmath15 in which the @xmath9 lowest electronic lls are fully occupied and the @xmath12 ll has filling @xmath17 .",
    "( states involving excitations of electrons across a ll are neglected at the lowest order approximation . ) from this basis , we construct a basis for composite fermions at @xmath15 following the standard procedure @xcite .",
    "the advantage of going to the cf description is that the dimension of the fock space in the cf theory is exponentially small compared to the dimension of the fock space of original electron problem . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath8 , there is only a single state in the low energy band , and nothing further remains to be done ( except , of course , to evaluate its properties ) .",
    "this state is the @xmath19 fqhe ground state . when there are many basis states , we diagonalize the coulomb hamiltonian in the cf basis",
    ". we will only give the results here , referring the reader to the literature for the construction of the wave functions and the diagonalization procedure @xcite .",
    "it is stressed that all energies obtained in our calculations are exact variational upper bounds .",
    "( a related approach for treating interacting composite fermions @xcite formulates the problem in terms of fermions with pair - wise interaction , which is deduced either from exact diagonalization or from cf theory by considering a system which has only two composite fermions in the second cf level . )    our focus in this article will be on the filling factor range @xmath0 .",
    "it has been confirmed in the past that the states at @xmath20 and @xmath21 are well described as one and two filled level of composite fermions . in this article , we ask if the composite fermion description continues to be valid at intermediate filling factors , where the composite fermions filling factor is @xmath22 .",
    "the underlying physical picture is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig0 ] ) : as the filling factor is increased from @xmath20 ( @xmath23 ) , the second level of composite fermions gets increasingly more densely populated , eventually becoming completely full and producing incompressibility at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the spherical geometry is used in all our calculations below , in which electrons move on the surface of a sphere , with the total flux through the surface of the sphere given by @xmath26 in units of the quantum of flux @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is either an integer or a half integer .",
    "the landau levels are angular momentum shells in this geometry , with the lowest ll corresponding to angular momentum @xmath28 , the second to @xmath29 , and so on .",
    "the many body eigenstates are labeled by their total orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath30 .",
    "interacting electrons at @xmath28 map into composite fermions at @xmath31 .",
    "it will be assumed that the magnetic field is sufficiently large that the spin degree of freedom is frozen and only fully spin polarized states are relevant .",
    "the electron filling factor @xmath20 maps into filling factor @xmath23 of composite fermions : the ground state is interpreted as one filled landau level of composite fermions ( fig .  [ fig0]a ) and excited states are obtained by creating particle hole pairs of composite fermions .    the effective flux at @xmath23 is @xmath32 . for the lowest energy excitation ,",
    "one particle is promoted to the next level , thus creating a particle hole pair of composite fermions .",
    "the particle and the hole have angular momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , giving the total angular momentum values of @xmath35 for the pair .",
    "it turns out that the particle hole state with @xmath36 at @xmath23 does not produce any @xmath36 state for composite fermions ; the wave function is annihilated upon lowest ll projection @xcite .",
    "thus the cf theory predicts single multiplets at @xmath37 , which is in agreement with exact results .",
    "the energies ( see @xmath38 in table i ) are in good agreement with the exact energies , especially in view of the fact that the wave functions contain no adjustable parameters .    to understand higher energy excitations we consider a mixture of states containing zero , one or two excitons of composite fermions .",
    "in this case , the basis at @xmath23 contains several states at each @xmath30 , producing , in turn , many states at each @xmath30 for @xmath20 .",
    "diagonalization in this basis produces the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . with this expanded basis ,",
    "the lowest energy in each @xmath30 sector predicted by the cf theory , given in table i , is practically exact .",
    "it is noted that finite thickness , disorder , and landau level mixing , neglected in this article , must be taken into account for an accurate quantitative comparison with experiment .",
    "the excitation energies observed in raman experiments are in qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement with the cf theory at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and nicely demonstrate the formation of landau - like levels in the intermediate fillings@xcite .",
    ".the second column gives the exact energy per particle for the lowest energy at orbital angular momenta @xmath39 for 10 particles at @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath40 is the energy of the state with a single particle hole pair of composite fermion , obtained with the help of a wave function with no adjustable parameters .",
    "@xmath41 is the energy from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , which is obtained by diagonalization in the fock space of all states containing 0 , 1 , or 2 pairs of particle hole excitations of composite fermions .",
    "the last column gives the % error for cases where @xmath41 differs from @xmath42 significantly .",
    "all energies are quoted in units of @xmath43 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "if the composite fermions were completely non - interacting , then there would be no fqhe at @xmath44 ( @xmath3 ) , just as there would be no fqhe for electrons at @xmath45 if the coulomb interaction were switched off .",
    "however , there is a weak residual interaction between composite fermions , which may possibly cause a gap to open , thereby producing a fqhe at @xmath3 .",
    "this provides a simple scenario for fqhe at 4/11 ( and a host of other new fractions ) .",
    "however , going beyond mere scenarios , the question is whether the residual interaction between composite fermions is sufficiently strongly repulsive at short distances to produce a fqhe of composite fermions here .",
    "a quantitative investigation of the issue requires a determination of minute energy differences accurately .",
    "given that we are dealing with a strongly correlated many body state , the situation might seem intractable at first , but , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) and table ii , the wave functions of the cf theory possess the desired accuracy .",
    "the systems at flux @xmath46 are believed to represent the thermodynamic filling @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the 12 particle system at @xmath47 and the 8 particle system at @xmath48 are relevant for possible fqhe at @xmath3 .",
    "( note that the quantum numbers of the low energy states in exact diagonalization are identical to the quantum numbers of all states of @xmath16 fermions at @xmath20 . ) for @xmath49 , the ground state appears to be incompressible , with an @xmath50 ground state and a gap to excitations .",
    "however , incompressibility in the thermodynamic limit requires one to study how the gap behaves as a function of @xmath14 and to show that it survives in the @xmath51 limit .",
    "that is particularly crucial here because , as wjs and quinn@xcite have noted , the exact spectrum for @xmath52 particles at @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) indicates a _ compressible _ ground state . also , while 12 may appear to be a reasonably large number of particles , the relevant number is @xmath53 , the number of composite fermions in the second level , just as at filling factor @xmath45 the relevant number is the number of electrons in the second ll , with the electrons filling up the lowest ll being inert . to further investigate if the incompressibility persists in larger systems , mandal and jain@xcite carried out cf diagonalization for @xmath54 , 20 , and 24 particles , for which @xmath55 , 6 , and 7",
    "it was found that as @xmath14 changes in steps of four , the system alternates between compressible ( @xmath52 , 16 , 24 ) and incompressible ( @xmath49 , 20 ) .",
    "the fact that two of the systems suggest an incompressible state makes the interpretation of the results somewhat less certain , but we do not know of any justification for disregarding the other systems .",
    "on the basis of the facts that ( i ) for all securely understood fqhe states to date , the spectrum reflects an incompressible state at _ all _ allowed values of @xmath14 ; and ( ii ) for states that are compressible in the thermodynamic limit , the spectrum can at times resemble an incompressible state for finite systems@xcite , it was concluded@xcite that the available results do not support incompressibility at @xmath3 for the model considered .",
    "this conclusion is at odds with the experimental observation@xcite of fqhe at @xmath3 . at the same time , the comparisons with exact results show that the cf theory is very accurate .",
    "how does one reconcile these two facts ?",
    "several possibilities come to mind .",
    "( i ) a partially spin polarized fqhe state at @xmath3 has been found to be stable theoretically@xcite , and one may wonder if the experimental 4/11 state could be partially polarized . from our calculations , it is possible to obtain a crude estimate of the crossover magnetic field .",
    "the coulomb energy of the partially polarized state is lower by approximately @xmath56 per particle compared to the coulomb energy of the fully polarized state .",
    "which one is the ground state depends on the zeeman splitting : at sufficiently low zeeman energies the partially polarized state is the ground state , but as the zeeman energy is increased , at some point there will be a transition into the fully polarized state . because the partially polarized state has one - fourth of the electron spins flipped , the crossover magnetic field is given by the formula @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the energy required to flip a single spin . for gaas parameters , the crossover magnetic field is estimated to be @xmath59 12 t for the idealized model , which is fairly high",
    "however , the @xmath3 fqhe has been observed at higher magnetic fields , which appears to rule out a partially polarized state here .",
    "( ii ) another possibility is that the assumption of neglecting finite thickness or landau level mixing is not sufficiently accurate for the problem of the 4/11 fqhe .",
    "these effects modify the form of the interaction between the electrons .",
    "usually , a slight modification of the interaction only causes a _ quantitative _ correction , but because of the extremely tiny energy scales governing the physics here , it is possible that it may alter the ordering of the energy levels to produce incompressibility .",
    "unfortunately , the neglected effects are not understood at the same level of accuracy as the cf theory of the fqhe .",
    "( iii ) we have explored above a 4/11 fqhe state that is analogous to @xmath44 fqhe of composite fermions .",
    "it is , in principle , possible that the 4/11 fqhe state is an entirely new type of incompressible state of composite fermions .      partial support of this research by the national science foundation under grants no .",
