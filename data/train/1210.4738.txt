    "it has been known since the mid 19th century that symmetric three forms in two dimensions ( binary cubics ) possess remarkable algebraic properties . more recently @xcite it was shown that real alternating three forms in six dimensions also have special algebraic properties .",
    "a common feature of these two spaces is that they are quite naturally symplectic vector spaces and there is a natural choice of lie algebra acting symplectically on them . in the case of real three forms ,",
    "hitchin @xcite exploited this observation extensively , and although historically the symplectic aspect with regard to binary cubics has been largely ignored , we @xcite showed that many of their important properties can be expressed in purely symplectic terms .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that there is a class of symplectic lie algebra representations over any field @xmath2 of characteristic not @xmath0 or @xmath1 that have many of the remarkable properties of both binary cubics and alternating three forms in six dimensions .",
    "these representations , which we call special symplectic representations ( ssr ) , are necessarily rare but examples include notably :    * @xmath3 acting on homogeneous polynomials of degree three in two variables ; * @xmath4 acting on primitive alternating three forms in six dimensions ; * @xmath5 acting on alternating three forms in six dimensions ; * a @xmath2-form of @xmath6 acting in a half - spinor representation defined over @xmath2 .",
    "the real vector space of alternating three forms in six dimensions is doubly interesting because its special algebraic properties have geometric implications .",
    "for example , certain of its open subsets are naturally endowed with specialdifferential geometric structure ( e.g. a special pseudo - k \" ahler metric @xcite ) . in the last section of the paper",
    "we show that the special algebraic properties of all ssrs lead to special geometry so that , suitably interpreted , this structure exists for special symplectic representations over a field @xmath2 of characteristic not @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "a special symplectic representation is a symplectic lie algebra representation with extra structure .",
    "if @xmath7 denotes the lie algebra and @xmath8 the representation space , this extra structure is an equivariant quadratic map @xmath9 satisfying a constraint ( cf definition [ ssrdefi ] ) . from @xmath10 and",
    "the symplectic form @xmath11 one can form two other symplectic covariants @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and these are the main technical tools of the paper .",
    "the three symplectic covariants generalise to any ssr the classical covariants of a binary cubic defined by eisenstein @xcite .",
    "our first results describe orbit properties of ssrs or , more precisely , properties of the vector space @xmath14 , the tangent space to a group orbit through @xmath15 if the action of @xmath7 is integrable .",
    "an unusual and important property is that @xmath14 is coisotropic if @xmath16 , and we think this property may characterise ssrs . for binary cubics it is more or less evident but seems not to have been known for other ssrs",
    ". of particular interest are generic orbits and minimal orbits .",
    "we show that @xmath14 is of codimension one if @xmath17 and that @xmath14 is lagrangian iff @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , an ssr is a prehomogeneous vector space for the lie algebra @xmath19 and the open orbits provide examples of noncommutative , completely integrable systems if @xmath20 or @xmath21 . although prehomogeneous vector spaces for algebraic groups have been very widely studied in the literature , there has not been a systematic investigation of their local / global geometric structure .",
    "the central result of the paper is the lagrangian decomposition theorem which involves all three symplectic covariants in an essential way .",
    "the existence of the following decomposition for complex binary cubics was known to dickson @xcite , and hitchin @xcite proved both its existence and uniqueness for suitably generic real alternating three forms in six dimensions .",
    "_ let @xmath22 be an ssr and let @xmath23 .",
    "_    \\(a ) @xmath24 is a nonzero square in @xmath2 iff there exist @xmath25 such that @xmath26    \\(b ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 of ( a ) are unique up to permutation .",
    "in fact there is a square root @xmath29 of @xmath24 such that @xmath30    in the case of the ssrs given above the zero set of @xmath10 is composed of :    * binary cubics with a triple root ; * decomposable primitive alternating three forms in six dimensions ; * decomposable alternating three forms in six dimensions ; * pure spinors in twelve dimensions .",
    "for a general ssr , one may have to quadratically extend before there are elements @xmath31 such that @xmath24 is a nonzero square or before the zero set of @xmath10 is nontrivial .",
    "the decomposition theorem has two important algebraic consequences .",
    "on the one hand it enables us to give a completely explicit description of the fibres of @xmath10 through generic points of @xmath8 , and , on the other , to prove that the symplectic covariants of an ssr satisfy a relation which generalises the eisenstein relation for the covariants of a binary cubic @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has an important geometric consequence as it is also ultimately the source of special \" geometric structures on appropriate subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "this is explained in the last section of the paper where we are able to formulate and prove a generalisation of the special geometric result in @xcite to the setting of arbitrary ssrs over fields of characteristic not 2 or 3 .",
    "the generality of the field of coefficients necessitates a different approach to the formulation of special geometry than appears in the literature .",

    "in addition , rjs wants to acknowledge the support of the max planck institut , bonn , for an extended stay during which some of this research was done .",
