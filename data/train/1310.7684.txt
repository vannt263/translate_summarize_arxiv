    "<S> we present a new picture that the @xmath0-linear - chain structure for @xmath1 and @xmath2 has one - dimensional @xmath0 condensate character . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions of linear - chain states which are described by superposing a large number of brink wave functions have extremely large overlaps of nearly 100% with single tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave functions , which were proposed to describe the @xmath0 condensed``gas - like '' states . </S>",
    "<S> although this new picture is different from the conventional idea of the spatial localization of @xmath0 clusters , the density distributions are shown to have localized @xmath0-clusters which is due to the inter-@xmath0 pauli repulsion .    </S>",
    "<S> the cluster formation is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom in nuclear structure  @xcite . in particular , for the last decade , the physics of @xmath0-particle condensation has triggered much interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best achievement in this direction is to have revealed that the hoyle state ( the @xmath3 state at @xmath4 mev in @xmath1 ) does not only have the @xmath5-cluster structure but also has an @xmath0-condensate - like structure of the @xmath5 clusters , which occupy an identical @xmath6 orbit of mean - field potential  @xcite . in @xmath2 the analog to the hoyle state </S>",
    "<S> was also proposed to exist theoretically as the @xmath7 state , which might be identified as the observed @xmath8 mev state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above @xmath0 condensate character was clarified with the use of the condensate - type microscopic cluster model wave function , so - called tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function does not put @xmath0 clusters on spatial positions any more like localized clustering but generates a quantum orbit occupied by the clusters , where they move in a non - localized way in a mean - field type potential of the @xmath0 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the thsr wave function has been used for the analysis of the `` gas - like '' state . </S>",
    "<S> the `` gas - like '' state is here defined to be the dilute cluster state whose density is a fraction of the normal density , where clusters are interacting weakly with each other , although this `` gas - like '' object is still much denser than an ordinary gas . for the `` gas - like '' states such as @xmath9 and the hoyle state , the solutions of 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 resonating group method ( rgm ) equation under the bound state approximation </S>",
    "<S> were found to be almost 100% equivalent to single 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 thsr wave functions , respectively  @xcite .    quite recently , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the thsr - type @xmath10 cluster model wave function was applied to the investigation of the inversion doublet bands of @xmath10 cluster structure in @xmath11 . in spite of the fact that the existence of the inversion doublet bands proves most convincingly the localized clustering of @xmath10  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , they showed that the single thsr wave functions are almost 100% equivalent to the solutions of @xmath10 rgm equation . </S>",
    "<S> since the thsr wave function expresses non - localized clustering , this result requires us to change the traditional understanding of clustering as the localized cluster structure . </S>",
    "<S> we should also note that for the ground state of @xmath1 the thsr wave function coincides by 93% with the 3@xmath0 rgm wave function  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another typical example of the localized clustering is the @xmath0-linear - chain state , where @xmath0 clusters are aligned on a line . </S>",
    "<S> thus the above mentioned results urge us to examine the non - localized picture of the thsr ansatz for @xmath0-linear - chain states that @xmath0 clusters occupy an identical lowest orbit of a prolate - deformed mean - field potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the 3@xmath0-linear - chain state , which was first proposed by morinaga about 60 years ago , was used to explain a structure of the hoyle state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this idea for the hoyle state was later replaced by the interpretation as a `` gas - like '' state of @xmath5 clusters , the higher @xmath12 state observed at @xmath13 mev has still been the possible candidate of the chain state , for which antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations predict a @xmath5 structure with slight bending from the linear - chain arrangement  @xcite .    as for the @xmath14-linear - chain states in @xmath2 , chevallier _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ observed the resonant @xmath15 , and @xmath16 states in an excitation energy region of @xmath17 mev in a reaction @xmath18 , which lie on a @xmath19 rotational trajectory with @xmath20 kev , consistent with a linear - chain of @xmath14 particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculation of @xmath0 reduced widths supported this picture  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> freer _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ also observed those states , which lie on the @xmath19 rotational trajectory with @xmath21 kev , still indicating extremely deformed shape  @xcite . on the other hand , at higher angular - momentum region , recently ichikawa _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ reported the formation and the stability of 4@xmath0-linear - chain state based on the cranked hartree - fock method which does not assume the existence of @xmath0 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that rotating 4@xmath0-linear - chain states with @xmath22 are formed and stable  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these examples , various theoretical and experimental studies of @xmath23-linear - chain states have been made for almost half a century  @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , even now , the understanding is insufficient . to clarify </S>",
    "<S> the nature of linear - chain states is very important from historical view . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the solutions of 3@xmath0- and 4@xmath0-linear - chain states obtained by the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) by using brink wave functions with the thsr wave functions . from this comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new understanding of the linear - chain structure .    </S>",
    "<S> first let us define the localized @xmath24 cluster wave function , which is known as the brink wave function  @xcite : @xmath25,\\label{eq : brink1}\\ ] ] @xmath26 @xmath27,\\label{eq : brink3}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the position parameter of the @xmath29-th @xmath0 particle , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the projection operators onto the angular momentum @xmath32 and positive parity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in all the subsequent calculations , we impose @xmath33 for the choice of the position - parameter values , to eliminate the spurious center - of - mass motion .    for the @xmath34 interaction , the volkov no.2 force  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is used with majorana parameter @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . for these choices of the majorana parameter , </S>",
    "<S> the binding energies of the ground states of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are calculated to be @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 mev , respectively , which are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data , @xmath39 mev and @xmath40 mev . as the size parameter of the @xmath0 particle </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt @xmath41 fm in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : brink3 ] ) , which gives a minimum energy of the @xmath0 particle , @xmath42 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider model space of the pure linear - chain state , by taking @xmath43 . in this model space </S>",
    "<S> we perform the gcm calculation by taking @xmath44 as discretized generator coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the gcm wave function can thus be written as , @xmath45 the coefficients @xmath46 can then be determined by solving the hill - wheeler equation , @xmath47 in order to obtain the converged solution of the above equation , we adopt @xmath48 and @xmath49 parameter values for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> these are determined by randomly generated distances between the adjacent clusters , @xmath51 , within a range of @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath53 which give the minimum energies are pushed outside as the increase of the angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the centrifugal force , which is strengthened by the increase of the angular momentum , is leading to a more elongated linear - chain structure . </S>",
    "<S> the minima tend to disappear at higher angular momentum . </S>",

    "<S> we can clearly see the @xmath5 and @xmath14 clusters , which are aligned on a straight line and are all localized . </S>",
    "<S> this result gives us a new understanding of clustering . </S>",
    "<S> even for the states which are described by non - localized - type wave function , localized nature of clustering can appear in density distribution due to the pauli principle . </S>",
    "<S> we can say that dynamics prefers non - localized clustering but kinematics coming from the pauli principle makes the system look like localized clustering . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be a common feature for the microscopic wave function having a shape with extremely prolate deformation , in which the cluster motions are restricted in one dimension . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] - ( left ) and @xmath14- ( right ) linear - chain states generated from the thsr wave functions before angular - momentum projection at ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) and ( @xmath69 , @xmath71 ) , respectively . , title=\"fig : \" ]    in summary , we investigated the @xmath5- and @xmath14-linear - chain states with the use of brink wave functions , where the @xmath0-particle motion is restricted to one dimension along @xmath68-axis . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained energy minima for a wide range of angular - momentum states for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the brink - gcm wave functions with sufficient energy convergence by superposing 100 and 300 brink wave functions adopted as bases to solve the hill - wheeler equation , for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then we compared the brink - gcm wave functions with the single thsr wave functions , which provide the @xmath0 condensate structure . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum squared overlaps between them amount to more than 98% for @xmath1 and 93% for @xmath2 , for @xmath72 states , at the shapes with strongly prolate deformation . </S>",
    "<S> these large overlap values at the extremely deformed shapes mean that the @xmath0-linear - chain states have the one - dimensional @xmath0 condensate character , where the @xmath0 clusters are trapped into a one - dimensional potential in a non - localized manner , like a `` gas '' . </S>",
    "<S> although this new picture is different from the conventional idea of the spatial localization of @xmath0 clusters , the density distributions are shown to have localized @xmath0-clusters which is due to the inter-@xmath0 pauli repulsion . to clarify the magnitude of the pauli effect in linear - chain states </S>",
    "<S> , we are investigating , for example , momentum distribution of @xmath0 clusters in the @xmath68-direction .    </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the bent linear - chain state . </S>",
    "<S> there is a possibility that real linear - chain structure bends . </S>",
    "<S> however , to understand the real linear - chain structure , it is very useful to know that one - dimensional condensate character is more essential than the localization character for the ideal straight linear - chain states .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - localized clustering picture was introduced in the study of inversion doublet of @xmath11  @xcite , which had been the important basis of the localized 2-body clustering picture . </S>",
    "<S> the present work has shown that the non - localized picture plays a crucial role in the more important example of the localized many - body clustering , the @xmath0-linear - chain state . </S>",
    "<S> this picture thus seems to hold in general cluster systems , and then opens a new horizon for the nuclear cluster physics . </S>"
