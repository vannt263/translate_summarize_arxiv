    "radiation from some isolated young neutron stars has been suggested to be powered by the decay of an ultra - high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "only this `` magnetar '' model has been able to explain the properties of the rare class of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , whose hallmark is repeated x - ray and gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a different rare class , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ,",
    "are characterized by soft x - ray pulsations @xcite , and have also been proposed as magnetars @xcite , from the similarity of their pulsations with those of sgrs in quiescence . however , competing models in which axps are accretion powered , via a fall - back disk rather than an unseen binary companion , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , the detection of two weak x - ray bursts from the direction of axp 1e  1048.1@xmath85937 argued for axps being magnetars @xcite . that axp had previously been identified as one that was most likely to burst on the basis of its unstable timing behavior which was reminiscent of that seen in sgrs , and because of its sgr - like spectrum @xcite .",
    "1e  2259 + 586 , a 7-s axp in the supernova remnant ctb  109 @xcite , in contrast to 1e 1048.1@xmath85937 , has shown remarkably stable timing behavior and pulsed x - ray fluxes in the past 5.6  yr @xcite .",
    "it also has the smallest inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of all axps ( and sgrs for which it has been determined ) , and has an x - ray spectrum softer than those of the sgrs .",
    "past observations have suggested , however , that the pulsar may experience epochs of activity , including flux , timing , and pulse profile variations @xcite .",
    "here we report a major sgr - like outburst from the axp 1e  2259 + 586 , in which over 80 x - ray bursts were detected along with a variety of significant changes to the pulsed and persistent emission .",
    "the 1e  2259 + 586 outburst was detected in an observation that was made as part of a long - term _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ axp monitoring program @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , bursts were seen during a 14.4  ks observation on june 18 , 2002 ( ut 15:39 ) .",
    "the total on source exposure time was 10.7  ks .",
    "data were taken with the proportional counter array ( pca ) in goodxenonwithpropane mode , which records photon arrival times with 1-@xmath7s resolution , and bins photon energies into 256 channels . in subsequent analysis , photon arrival times at each epoch were adjusted to the solar system barycentre .",
    "the resulting time series were analysed in a variety of ways .",
    "figure  1 shows the light curve binned with 125  ms time resolution , along with time series of several properties of the pulsed and persistent emission ( see below ) .",
    "the decreasing burst rate and flux throughout our observation clearly indicates that we observed only the end of an event that commenced prior to the start of our observations .",
    "lightcurves in the three operational pcus look similar .",
    "only the largest burst showed any excess in the pca standard 1 `` remaining counts , '' however , the flux correction due to deadtime is minimal ( @xmath310% ) .    to identify all bursts , the time series made using photons in the 220  kev range were searched for significant excursions from the mean count rate by comparing each time bin value with a windowed 7-s running mean .",
    "bursts were identified assuming poissonian statistics , and by combining probabilities from the separate pcus .",
    "a detailed description of the burst search algorithm and subsequent analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we summarize the main results .",
    "the bursts range in duration from 2  ms to 3  s and show a variety of structures .",
    "a few ( @xmath310 ) have clear fast - rise , exponential - tail morphology , however the rest appear approximately symmetric .",
    "their spectra are all well modeled by simple power laws , with indices in the range @xmath30.25 to @xmath32.4 .",
    "burst fluences in the 210 kev band are in the range @xmath9 to @xmath10  erg  @xmath2 , corresponding to energies @xmath11 to @xmath12  erg , assuming isotropic emission and a distance of 3  kpc to the source @xcite .",
    "the sum total of all burst fluences is @xmath13  erg  @xmath2 , corresponding to energy @xmath14  erg ( 210 kev ) .",
    "peak burst fluxes in the 210  kev band are in the range @xmath15 to @xmath16  erg  s@xmath17  @xmath2 , corresponding to peak luminosities of @xmath18 to @xmath19  erg  s@xmath17 .",
    "follow - up _ rxte _ observations on june 20 revealed no further bursts , nor have any of the 15 observations , each of duration 78  ks , obtained every @xmath310 days since . neither target - of - opportunity observations obtained with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite on june 21 , nor _ xmm - newton _ observations scheduled fortuitously 7 days prior to the burst , revealed any additional bursts ( work in preparation ) .",
    "the _ rxte _ all sky monitor observed the field on june 18 at uts 03:50 and 14:43 for @xmath390  s per observation but detected no enhanced flux , with 99% confidence upper limits of @xmath20  erg  s@xmath17  @xmath2 ( 210  kev ) .    in spite of the large ( 1@xmath21 ) field of view of the pca",
    ", we are certain that the axp is the origin of the bursts , as many properties of the pulsed emission were simultaneously observed to change dramatically ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the persistent flux evolution was determined as follows .",
    "a spectral analysis was done using the xspec software package v11.2.0 , in which the preburst pca data for 1e  2259 + 586 were modeled using the best available background models made with the ftool pcabackest ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/recipes/p2.html ) , the pulsar spectrum as determined using a _ xmm - newton _ observation of the pulsar made 1 week before the burst observation ( work in preparation ) , and an additional component to account for the remaining emission in the pca field - of - view .",
    "the burst data were modeled by a blackbody plus power - law component , while holding the pulsar equivalent neutral hydrogen column density and the remaining emission model fixed .",
    "the resulting persistent fluxes are show in figure  1 ( second panel from the top ) . the pulsed flux evolution ,",
    "also show in in figure  1 ( second panel from the top ) was calculated by first folding @xmath3200  s long data segments with the spin ephemeris ( table 1 ) , then summing the first six harmonics of the normalized fourier powers of the resulting pulse profiles .",
    "the total 210  kev fluence over and above the quiescent flux is @xmath22  erg  @xmath2 , two orders of magnitude above that in the bursts . as is also seen in figure  1 , the pulsar spectrum clearly hardened during the outburst , and relaxed back toward the quiescent spectral paramters during the course of the observation .",
    "the fitted blackbody radius remained approximately constant throughout .",
    "interestingly , the same can not be said of the ratio of power - law to blackbody flux ; as is seen in the bottom panel of figure  1 , the latter continued evolving away from the quiescent state during our observation .",
    "a significant change in the pulse morphology was observed at the burst epoch , as shown in figure 2 . during the outburst ,",
    "the amplitudes of the peaks relative to the pre- and post - outburst profiles are clearly reversed .",
    "the relative phase displayed above is that successfully used in our timing analysis .",
    "the profile change is similar in different energy bands .",
    "this different pulse profile persisted for at least 2 days following the outburst , and gradually returned to its pre - outburst morphology after @xmath36 days ( gavriil et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the star underwent a sudden spin up or `` glitch '' at the outburst epoch .",
    "for details regarding how the timing analysis was done , see @xcite . for the burst and immediate post - outburst data , the pulse profile changes described above resulted in obvious",
    "phase jumps corresponding to the two peaks being swapped in the cross - correlation .",
    "the glitch epoch was determined by requiring zero phase jump between pre- and post - outburst ephemerides .",
    "the _ rxte _ data obtained during and after the burst are well characterized ( rms residual 1.5% of the period for the full data set ) by @xmath23 , similar to that observed in radio pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "the best - fit glitch epoch is consistent at the @xmath24 level with having occurred during our observation .",
    "additionally , the spin - down rate can be modeled as having approximately doubled abruptly .",
    "precise spin parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "residuals from the last @xmath3100  days of timing suggest that the spin - down rate may have relaxed back to near its pre - burst value by @xmath360  days post - outburst , however additional observations are required to confirm this .",
    "target - of - opportunity near - infrared observations were made using the niri instrument at the 8-m _ gemini_-north telescope in hawaii on june 21 at ut 14:44 using a @xmath6 filter ( 0.15 @xmath7 m wide centred on 2.15  @xmath7 m ) .",
    "the observation had total exposure 1530  s with 0.7@xmath25 seeing and light cirrus .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ gemini _ iraf package and photometry performed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the proposed infrared counterpart @xcite of 1e  2259 + 586 had magnitude @xmath26 , @xmath27  mag ( factor of @xmath28 ) brighter 3  days after the outburst than was observed in a 2000 _ keck _ telescope observation @xcite .",
    "a second _ gemini_/niri observation was obtained on june 28 at ut 14:51 , with 900  s of exposure and 0.55@xmath25 seeing .",
    "this time , the axp counterpart had faded to magnitude @xmath29 , for a difference relative to the 2000 _ keck _ observation of @xmath30  mag ( factor of @xmath31 in brightness ) .",
    "photometric measurements on 7 reference objects in the field agreed with those obtained at _ keck _ to within 0.007 mag and 0.028 mag for the first and second nights , respectively .    target - of - opportunity radio observations were also made using the _ very large array _ in new mexico on june 20 , 2002 .",
    "the 1e  2259 + 586 field was observed for 2420  s in b array at a central observing frequency of 1424.3 mhz .",
    "after standard calibration , imaging and cleaning using the miriad software package , an rms noise level of 15  @xmath7jy / beam ( @xmath32 beam ) was achieved .",
    "no emission was detected .",
    "we place a 3@xmath33 upper limit of @xmath34  @xmath7jy on the radio flux for this epoch .",
    "the x - ray phenomenology we have observed in this major axp outburst is all reminiscent of that seen in sgr bursts .",
    "the short bursts ( fig . 1 ) are very similar to short sgr bursts .",
    "the long , thermally evolving tail is similar to that seen in a handful of sgr bursts @xcite . a timing anomaly in sgr 1900",
    "+ 14 was seen at the time of the giant flare in 1998 @xcite , as was a pulse profile change and enhanced pulsed and persistent flux @xcite .",
    "thus , this axp has shown uniquely sgr - like bursting behavior .",
    "1e  2259 + 586 showed the most stable timing behavior of all axps in the 5.6  yr prior to this event @xcite , while 1e  1048.1@xmath85937 , the only other axp seen to burst @xcite , showed the least stable behavior , as well as the hardest axp spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus it seems any axp can burst .",
    "the properties of the outburst solve a number of previously outstanding axp problems .",
    "a similar pulse profile change was claimed previously in data for 1e  2259 + 586 from the _ ginga _ mission in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the archival _ ginga _ data show no evidence of bursts .",
    "the _ ginga _",
    "observation probably took place just after an outburst , consistent with the reported timing anomaly at the same epoch @xcite .",
    "this suggests that such outbursts occur on decade time scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , previously reported large x - ray flux variations in 1e  2259 + 586 and 1e  1048.1@xmath85937 @xcite that were called into question by the flux stability observed in the @xmath35  yr prior to june 2002 @xcite are now more understandable as enhanced emission due to bursting episodes .",
    "pulsations from the axp candidate ax  j1845@xmath80258 have been detected only once , in spite of multiple observations @xcite .",
    "this may have been following a similar outburst ( though there is no evidence for bursts in the archival _ asca _ data ) .",
    "the 1e  2259 + 586 outburst likely resulted from a sudden event in the stellar crust , such as a crustal fracture , which simultaneously affected both the superfluid interior and the magnetosphere .",
    "the large spin - up can be explained by the coupling of the faster - rotating superfluid inside the star with the crust , following the unpinning of angular momentum vortices from crustal nuclei .",
    "the fractional frequency increase is similar to that observed in many radio pulsars @xcite but is smaller than could have been detected in sgr timing data .",
    "however , the factor of two increase in the spin - down rate is unprecedented for radio pulsars , though possibly not for sgrs @xcite . according to glitch theory",
    "@xcite , when the glitch occurs , a portion of the superfluid decouples , decreasing the effective moment of inertia of the star .",
    "for fixed external torque , an increase in spin - down rate results . for radio pulsars ,",
    "the decoupled portion amounts to @xmath31% of the stellar moment of inertia , corresponding to the observed @xmath31% increases in spin - down rates @xcite . for 1e  2259 + 586 , however , most of the stellar moment of inertia would have had to decouple .",
    "this could imply a decoupling of core , as opposed to crustal , superfluid .",
    "alternatively , the external torque could have changed , due to a restructuring of the magnetosphere .",
    "indeed the enhanced x - ray luminosity is too large to be explained as energy dissipated by vortex unpinning @xcite or crustal elastic energy @xcite .",
    "a decaying magnetar - strength magnetic field can cause severe stress on the crust .",
    "a large - scale fracture could trigger vortex unpinning , and , simultaneously , shift magnetic field footpoints , resulting in a magnetospheric reconfiguration @xcite .",
    "the pulse profile variation is unlikely to be a result of the change in magnetospheric structure @xcite , since the torque change is much longer - lived .",
    "rather , the profile change probably occurred at the surface ; the effective blackbody radius of @xmath31  km as determined from the spectral fits supports a localized enhancement .",
    "notably , there is no evidence for an accompanying giant soft gamma - ray flare , as might be expected from a sudden restructuring of the surface magnetic field of a magnetar @xcite . from the _ interplanetary network _",
    "spacecraft , an upper limit on the fluence of a soft gamma - ray flare from 1e  2259 + 586 , near the time of the x - ray outburst , is @xmath35  erg  @xmath2 ( 25 - 150 kev ) on time scales 0.25 - 0.5 s ( k. hurley 2002 , personal communication ) .",
    "this corresponds to an energy @xmath36  erg , six orders of magnitude below that released in the giant sgr flares .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of any radio emission post - outburst from 1e  2259 + 586 , as well as with the absence of bright soft gamma - ray flares from this source in the past .",
    "thompson & duncan ( 1996 ) showed that the absence of a large flare in the event of a glitch requires the neutron star crust to have deformed plastically .",
    "this demands a magnetic field roughly two orders of magnitude greater than that implied by the spin - down of 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "this could be explained by higher order multipole moments which are negligible at the light cylinder , where the spin - down torque arises .",
    "the characteristic age ( @xmath37  kyr ) of 1e  2259 + 586 is much larger than the inferred age ( @xmath38  kyr ) of the supernova remnant ctb  109 in which it resides @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to explain this discrepancy as being due to the pulsar having episodes of transient accelerated spin - down such as we observe post - outburst .",
    "however at least in this instance , the increased spin - down rate could be roughly compensated by the sudden spin - up .",
    "the near - infrared enhancement post - outburst is intriguing .",
    "currently , the magnetar model does not address the origin of such emission .",
    "in conventional rotation - powered pulsars , infrared emission is thought to arise from a population of synchrotron radiating electron / positron pairs in the outer magnetosphere ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an enhancement is therefore consistent with a change in the magnetospheric field structure suggested by the torque change .",
    "future observations can test this by comparing infrared variations to the torque evolution .",
