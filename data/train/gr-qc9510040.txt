    ".    quite often , however , one encounters circumstances where a lightlike foliation is especially suitable . because of the degeneracies that arise in the lightlike case the imbedding relations are very different and the situation not quite so familiar and under control . to bypass the degeneracies , one is forced to fall back to a foliation of codimension  2 , by spacelike 2-surfaces .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to develop a simple @xmath0-imbedding formalism of this kind .",

    "the essential feature of the present approach is that it maintains manifest two - dimensional covariance while operating with objects having direct geometrical meaning .",
    "two - dimensional covariance permits reduction of the einstein field equations to an especially concise and transparent form : the ten ricci components are embraced in a set of just three compact , two - dimensionally covariant expressions .",

    "the basic metrical notions ( adapted co - ordinates , basis vectors and form of the metric ) are defined in sec .",

    ", we introduce in two - dimensionally covariant form the geometrical information encoded in first derivatives of the metric : the extrinsic curvatures and `` twist , '' as well as the invariant operators which perform differentiation along the two lightlike normals .",

    "their most efficient derivation calls for a formalism that is both four- and two - dimensionally covariant .",
    "unfortunately , these two requirements do not mesh easily .",
    "four - dimensional covariance tends to clutter the formulae by treating subsidiary two - dimensional quantities like shift vectors and the two - dimensional connection as 4-scalars , on a par with the primary geometrical properties , extrinsic curvature and twist .",
    "those properties , for their part , are correlated , not with four - dimensional covariant derivatives , but with lie derivatives , which are non - metric and have no direct link to curvature . to patch up these differences , and thus streamline the derivations ,",
