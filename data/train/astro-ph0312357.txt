    "the discovery and characterization of brown dwarfs in young clusters can help answer fundamental questions about the star formation process .",
    "do brown dwarfs dominate in number or mass over low mass stars in young clusters ? do the mass functions of young clusters exhibit a characteristic mass and do they resemble the field star initial mass function ( imf ) ? are there differences between the infrared or x - ray properties of young low mass stars and brown dwarfs that would suggest separate formation mechanisms ?",
    "for example , it has been suggested that some brown dwarfs are ejected from young , multiple star systems thus limiting their accretion phase ( reipurth & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "studies of the mass functions of young clusters rely critically on the substellar population to define the peaks of the mass functions and possible low - mass cut - offs ( e.g. , hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ; luhman 2000 ; bjar 2001 ; najita 2000 ; muench 2002 ) . such studies will not only help establish whether there are significant variations in the mass functions between young clusters but if these depend on the physical conditions of the cluster gas ( briceno 2002 ) .",
    "young brown dwarfs are readily observed in near - infrared surveys of dark clouds since their luminosity is derived from gravitational contraction as well as a brief period of deuterium burning ( e.g. , burrows 1997 ) .",
    "for example , models predict that in the nearest star - forming regions an object with a mass of 0.04 m@xmath6 will have a k magnitude of 12.4 at an age of 1 myr ( dantona & mazzitelli 1998 ) .",
    "recent infrared surveys of young clusters such as the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and ic 348 suggest sizable populations of brown dwarfs ( e.g. hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ; luhman 2000 ; muench 2002 ; muench 2003 ) .",
    "however due to an ambiguity in the derived age and mass , mass estimates from infrared photometric data alone are reliable only in a statistical sense .",
    "determination of the effective temperature through spectroscopy removes this ambiguity and leads to more accurate determinations of the visual extinction and stellar luminosity , and with the help of models , the age and mass .",
    "hence , potential substellar objects can be identified and studied on an individual basis .",
    "infrared spectroscopy is ideal for confirming the nature of young brown dwarf candidates because of the obscuration by dust inherent in star - forming regions and the presence of broad water vapor absorption bands in cool photospheres that can be used to derive effective temperatures using low resolution ( r@xmath7300 ) spectra ( e.g. , wilking , greene , & meyer 1999 , hereafter wgm ) .",
    "the ngc 1333 reflection nebula and its associated dark cloud l1450 are part of a chain of molecular clouds in the perseus region ( e.g. , sargent 1979 ; loren 1976 ) .",
    "analysis of hipparcos data suggests a distance of 300 pc ( de zeeuw 1999 ; belikov 2002 ) .",
    "the observations of emission - line stars and herbig - haro objects first established ngc 1333 as an active region of star formation ( herbig & rao 1972 ; herbig 1974 ) . surveys of the cloud at near - infrared , far - infrared , and submillimeter wavelengths have revealed that it is forming primarily low mass stars with the most massive young stars , svs  3 and bd+30  549 , exhibiting spectral types in the range of b6b9 ( e.g. , strom , vrba , & strom 1976 ; harvey , wilking , & joy 1984 ; aspin 1994 ; lada , alves , & lada 1996 ; jennings 1987 ; sandell & knee 2001 , aspin 2003 ) .",
    "most of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the ngc 1333 cloud are concentrated in the highest column density gas and are arranged into a northern and southern cluster , each with about 70 members .",
    "we utilized deep ( k@xmath016 ) near - infrared surveys of the ngc 1333 cloud core , including our new survey of the northern cluster , to select 25 brown dwarf candidates among the low mass population .",
    "infrared spectra of the candidates were obtained , in addition to a collection of dwarf , subgiant , and giant standards , and a water vapor index was developed to yield estimates for their effective temperatures assuming dwarf to subgiant surface gravities . using theoretical tracks and isochrones , we used our derived effective temperatures and stellar luminosities to identify brown dwarfs and to investigate their collective properties such as mass , age , infrared excess , x - ray emission , and surface gravity .",
    "finally , we use our survey of the northern cluster and the median age of the brown dwarf candidates to assemble an extinction - limited sample of ysos in the ngc 1333 core .",
    "we use this sample to explore the stellar density , disk frequency , and the broad features of the mass spectrum for comparsion with other young clusters and the field star imf .",
    "to assist in the identification of brown dwarf candidates , we first obtained a new , deep near - infrared survey of the northern cluster .",
    "these data were supplemented with published infrared surveys of the southern cluster to construct a sample of candidates for near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "near - infrared images of the ngc  1333 northern cluster were obtained using the 1.6 meter telescope at mt .",

    "the same median - combined image , with dark current subtracted , was used to flat - field frames .",
    "mosaics were constructed for each 5x5 raster using the routine sqmos within the infrared reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "we repeated the 5x5 raster 10 times at j and k , and 8 times at h. the mosaics at a given wavelength were combined to yield a total integration time of 20 , 10.7 , and 6.7 minutes at j , h , and k , respectively , in the central regions of the field .",
    "automated source extraction was performed on the final k mosaic using daofind with a threshold of 5 times the rms noise .",
    "a total of 213 unsaturated sources were extracted at k. the pixel positions of these sources were used to center apertures for photometry of individual sources in all three bands resulting in a total of 211 sources measured at h and 187 at j. aperture photometry was performed using apphot in iraf using an aperture diameter of 3.7 .",
    "this aperture was twice the average fwhm of the stellar images and provided the optimum signal - to - noise ( howell 1989 ) .",
    "observations of faint ukirt standards were used to determine aperture corrections of 0.28 , 0.29 , and 0.22 mag at j , h , and k , respectively .",
    "the jhk data are presented in table 1 in the cit photometric system . to place our photometry ( labeled mbo ) in the cit photometric system ,",
    "we first compared our magnitudes for 54 sources with k@xmath1313.5 mag with those determined from the sqiid survey of lada , alves , & lada ( 1996 , hereafter lal ) .",
    "to place our h and k data in the same photometric system as lal , only a zero point correction determined from this comparison was needed .",
    "the conversion of our j magnitudes used the following correction : @xmath14 to convert our photometry into the cit photometric system , which is very close to the sqiid system , we used the prescription of kenyon ( 1998 ) . only the statistical errors in the photometry are quoted in table 1",
    ". however these errors can be exceeded by uncorrected variations in the responsivity across the array due to vignetting that introduce an uncertainty of @xmath20.05 mag .",
    "errors as large as @xmath20.10 mag can occur in the outer regions of the mosaic due to the lower signal - to - noise .",
    "a histogram of the number of sources vs. apparent magnitude was constructed for each wavelength and the turnovers in the histograms were used to estimate the completeness limits of our survey at j , h , and k to be 17.5 , 16.5 , and 16 mag , respectively .",
    "the positions in table 1 were computed relative to a secondary reference frame defined by herbig & jones ( 1983 ) and are accurate to @xmath20.5 .",
    "brown dwarf candidates were selected based upon their broadband near - infrared colors .",

    "exposures of the dome interior illuminated with incandescent lamps through the broadband k filter were used for flat - fielding .",
    "a set of observations consisted of the star observed at two positions along the slit , separated by 10 arcsec .",
    "a typical exposure time for the brown dwarf candidates was 120 seconds per slit position and limited by variations in the atmospheric oh emission .",
    "total on - source integration times were typically 2 minutes for the standard star observations and ranged from 8 to 36 minutes for the brown dwarf candidates ( see table 2 ) .",
    "all data were reduced using iraf . before extraction ,",
    "the spectral images in each set were sky - subtracted using their companion image , and divided by a normalized , dark - subtracted flat - field .",
    "wavelength calibration was established using oh emission lines .",
    "after extraction , the spectra were median - combined after matching their wavelengths .",
    "the resulting spectra were shifted to the same wavelength scale as a a spectrum of either the a0v star hr  1237 or the a1v star hr  1027 that was observed close in time and airmass by cross - correlating telluric absorption lines .",
    "telluric features in the combined spectra were removed by dividing by the appropriate a star spectrum .",
    "no attempt was made to restore the true continuum shape of the program objects ; to recover the true shape one could multiply each spectrum by a blackbody spectrum corresponding to the effective temperature of the telluric standard . because of the steep response function of the grism , it was not possible to extrapolate over the br @xmath19 absorption line in the telluric standard and hence we were not sensitive to br @xmath19 emission in the program stars .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios achieved in the normalized continua ( snr@xmath20 ) of the reduced spectra are listed in the last column of table 2 .",
    "in the k - band , water vapor absorption bands centered at 1.9 @xmath8 m and 2.5 @xmath8 m provide the best means for deriving spectral types for reddened m stars .",
    "these bands are not only sensitive to temperature for cool stars ( jones 1994 ) but also are well - resolved in low resolution spectra .",
    "water vapor indices have been used to derive spectral types for very low mass ysos in @xmath21 ophiuchi ( wgm99 , cushing , tokunaga , & kobayashi 2000 ) , ic  348 ( najita , teide , & carr 2000 ) , the onc ( lucas 2001 ) , the chamaeleon cloud ( gomez & persi 2002 ) , and the taurus cloud ( itoh , tamura , & tokunaga 2002 ) . in wgm99 , we defined a q index that was independent of reddening as a measure of the depth of the water vapor absorption : @xmath22 where f1 , f2 , and f3 are the average relative fluxes in narrow bands covering 2.072.13 @xmath8 m , 2.26952.2875 @xmath8 m , and 2.402.50 @xmath8 m , respectively . the uncertainty in q",
    "was calculated by using eqn .",
    "2 and propagating error estimates for the mean fluxes in f1 , f2 , and f3 .",
    "the error in f@xmath23 is given by @xmath24 = f@xmath23/(@xmath25 ) where n is the number of channels in f@xmath23 and @xmath26 is the signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum .",
    "this assumes the flux uncertainty in each channel of the band f@xmath23 is the same . as a check , we calculated the uncertainty in the q values for 3 brown dwarf candidates by calculating the standard deviation of the ensemble of q estimates from individual spectra .",
    "the two estimates are in excellent agreement .    a linear fit to a plot of the q index vs. the optically - determined m spectral type for dwarf standards weighted by the uncertainties in q for stars from m0.5v ",
    "m9v yields the following relation @xmath27 with a correlation coefficient of r=0.98 for a sample of 12 measurements .",
    "this relation supercedes that in wgm99 as it utilizes an improved wavelength calibration , a redefinition of the f2 band , and a better estimate of the uncertainty in q. this relation is plotted in blue in fig .",
    "a sample of seven subgiants were selected for infrared spectroscopic observations from the mbm  12 and ic  348 yso populations ( hearty 2000 ; luhman 2001 ; luhman 1998 ; luhman 1999 ) .",
    "the median ages of these clusters are estimated to be 2 myr and the median ages of the sources in our sample is 1 myr . as shown in fig . 3 in green , the linear fit to the subgiant sample is consistent with the dwarf relation and",
    "there is no strong sensitivity of the q index to surface gravities in the dwarf to subgiant range .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of gorlova ( 2003 ) who found the linear relationship between the water index and m spectral type of young cluster objects ( log(g)=3.68@xmath20.42 ) closely resembled that of a sample of field stars ( log(g)=5.17@xmath20.38 ) .",
    "the q values for the 8 giants observed show a much greater scatter from a linear fit ( shown in red in fig .",
    "3 ) . in our sample ,",
    "the giant star spectra are distinct from those of dwarfs and always display weaker water vapor absorption than dwarfs for a given spectral type ( see appendix a ) .",
    "band is not evident until a spectral type of m7iii .",
    "yet , the q index for giants can be smaller than that of dwarfs of the same spectral type due to enhanced absorption by co that mimics water vapor absorption in the 2.402.50 @xmath8 m band .",
    "variability must also contribute to the scatter in the giant sample ; all of the stars from m4-m9 are known variables and two ( vy  peg and aw  psc ) are mira variables .",
    "we conclude that the q index is not a useful measure of spectral type for objects with the surface gravities of giant stars .",
    "we observed one - half of the 50 sources in an extinction - limited sample defined in fig .",
    "2 with estimated masses of m=0.040.10 m@xmath15 and a@xmath28 @xmath110 mag .",
    "all 25 brown dwarf candidates displayed late - type photospheres with absorption due to water vapor and co. spectra are presented in fig .",
    "since the surface gravities of objects in this sample are likely to resemble closely those of the subgiants observed , spectral types were derived using eqn .",
    "3 which is appropriate for both subgiants and dwarfs .",
    "q values and the resulting spectral classifications for the brown dwarf candidates are presented in table 3 .",
    "uncertainties in the q index were @xmath20.0100.022 due to statistical errors alone leading to uncertainties in the m spectral type of @xmath20.2@xmath20.4 subclasses .",
    "the derived spectral types vary between m2.5 and m8.0 , with 17 of 25 candidates displaying spectral types between m6.0 and m8.0 .",
    "visual extinctions were derived using the relation a@xmath28 = 9.09@xmath29[@xmath30 - @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the instrinsic color for a given spectral type ( wgm99 ) .",
    "the values for a@xmath28 are @xmath04 mag for all but 2 sources and @xmath07 mag for all sources , consistent with their locations in the color - color diagram ( fig",
    "the majority of the candidates appear to be ysos of very low mass .",
    "the projection of this sample on the high column density core ( a@xmath28 @xmath16 10 mag ) , coupled with the relatively low visual extinctions of the candidates , minimizes the chance that some objects are background m stars .",
    "in addition , fifteen of the 25 candidates are known x - ray sources , including 3 tentative detections ( getman 2002 , preibisch 2003 ) .",
    "the detection of x - ray emission argues in favor of the youth of this sample , as x - ray luminosity and stellar activity are known to decline with age for k and m stars ( fleming , schmitt , & giampapa 1995 ) .",
    "finally , we estimate the number of foreground stars at this galactic latitude and longitude using star count models . using the wainscoat ( 1992 ) models , which have been found to agree with the observed star counts from the 2mass survey to within 15% ( carpenter 2000 ) , we predict at most 2 foreground objects in the sample of 25 .",
    "there are no strong infrared excesses among the spectroscopic sample of brown dwarf candidates .",
    "the candidates are plotted on a ( j - h ) vs. ( h - k ) diagram in fig .",
    "5 relative to the loci of giants , dwarfs ( through m6 ) , and classical t tauri stars ( ctts , meyer , calvet , & hillenbrand 1997 ) . objects that lie to the right of the reddening band for main sequence stars have possible k excesses . asr  79 lies to the left of the reddening band , a likely result of an associated infrared nebula known optically as hh  4 . in addition , we have computed the excess emission at k , defined as r@xmath33=f@xmath34/f@xmath35 , for each source where f@xmath34 is the k - band flux from circumstellar emission and f@xmath35 is the expected stellar flux at @xmath17=2.2 @xmath8 m .",
    "is calculated by comparing dereddened observed colors to intrinsic colors , i.e. , r@xmath33 = f@xmath36/f@xmath37 = [ ( 1+r@xmath38)(10@xmath39/2.5}$])]-1 .",
    "our estimates for r@xmath33 are lower limits since , by dereddening to intrinsic dwarf colors , we have assumed r@xmath40=r@xmath38=0 ( e.g. , meyer 1997 ) . ]",
    "these values are presented in table 3 .",
    "while moderate k - band excesses are indicated for asr  38 and mbo  79 , the majority of objects have colors consistent with no k - band excess .",
    "as noted in wgm99 , strong veiling by dust can lead one to derive spectral types using the q index that are too early by 2 - 3 subclasses .",
    "it is possible that the calculated spectral types for asr  38 and mbo  79 are too early by 12 subclasses due to moderate veiling , but it is expected that the spectral types for the remaining objects are relatively unaffected .",
    "objects without strong k - band excess emission may also possess circumstellar disks .",
    "disk luminosities are expected to be lower for very low mass stars and substellar objects resulting in cooler inner disks and little or no k - band excess .",
    "such a trend has been observed in the onc ( hillenbrand 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , l - band surveys have been shown to be more sensitive to the thermal disk emission in low mass objects ( haisch , lada , & lada 2001 ) .",
    "a recent lsurvey by liu , najita , & tokunaga ( 2003 ) has revealed that about 80% of the young brown dwarfs in their sample showed evidence for circumstellar disks .",
    "we followed the procedure outlined in wgm99 to estimate the masses and ages of the brown dwarf candidates .",
    "briefly , the adopted temperature scale for m dwarfs derived in wgm99 is based on the modified blackbody fits of jones ( 1996 ) .",
    "this temperature scale overlaps with the scale adopted by dahn ( 2002 ) for m5l8 dwarfs and is consistent within mutual uncertainties .",
    "effective temperatures for each brown dwarf candidate derived in this manner are given in table 3 .",
    "their typical uncertainties of @xmath295 k or @xmath20.016 dex are due to nearly equal contributions from the errors in the determination of the spectral type and the temperature scale . however",
    ", systematic effects could affect the derived effective temperatures .",
    "as alluded to earlier , the presence of moderate veiling in 2 objects could lead us to overestimate their effective temperatures by @xmath7150 k. the assumption of dwarf , rather than subgiant , surface gravities could also systematically affect our results . for spectral types of m2 and later , giant star temperatures are warmer than dwarfs by 300500 k for stars of the same spectral type ( for example see fig . 4 in itoh 2002 ) .",
    "hence by assuming a dwarf surface gravity , we may be underestimating the effective temperature of an m2 subgiant by @xmath7150 k and of an m6m9 subgiant by @xmath7250 k. with these caveats in mind , we adopt the temperatures listed in table 3 for our brown dwarf candidates assuming a dwarf temperature scale .",
    "values for log(l@xmath41/l@xmath15 ) were derived from the absolute j magnitude and are presented in table 3 .",
    "the formal uncertainties of log(l@xmath41/l@xmath15 ) are @xmath20.18 dex and were estimated by propagating errors in the bolometric correction , the j magnitude , the distance modulus , and the extinction at j.    in fig .",
    "6 , we have plotted our 25 brown dwarf candidates on hertzsprung - russell diagrams overlaid with the theoretical tracks and isochrones from the models of of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997,1998 , hereafter dm ) , baraffe ( 1998 , hereafter bcah ) , and burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the dm models use opacities from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) , the full spectrum of turbulence convection model of canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 ) , and assume mass fractions of helium , metals , and deuterium of y=0.28 , z=0.02 , and x@xmath42=2 @xmath29 10@xmath43 .",

    "thus , as shown in fig .",

    "1 with average visual extinctions of 6.5 , 13.5 , 20.5 , 27.5 , 34.5 , and 41.5 mag . galactic star count models ( wainscoat 1992 ) were then used with the corresponding extinction screen to predict the number of foreground and background stars in the field .",
    "we find that of the 141 infrared sources in this region , it is estimated no more than 15 are field stars . for an effective radius of 0.44 pc ( @xmath47 = @xmath48 where a is the area of the box ) ,",
    "this suggests a stellar density of @xmath7360 stars pc@xmath49 .",
    "such stellar densities are typical of infrared clusters and underscore their stability against tidal disruption by nearby clouds while they are gravitationally bound by the molecular gas ( e.g. , wilking 2001 ) .      using the median age derived for the spectroscopic sample",
    ", we will define an unbiassed sample of ysos to explore the disk frequency and mass function of the northern cluster .",
    "first , estimates for the extinction toward each member of subsample are needed .",
    "depending on their location in the ( j - h ) vs. ( h - k ) color  color diagram , and the m@xmath50 vs. ( j - h ) color  magnitude diagram , objects were dereddened either to the ctts locus ( color  color diagram ) or to a pre - main sequence isochrone ( color  magnitude diagram ) . if the ( j - h ) vs. ( h - k ) colors of objects in our sample lie within the reddened ctts locus ( fig .",
    "5 ) , _ and _ the dereddened absolute j  band magnitude is consistent with a mass greater than 0.1 m@xmath6 , the source was dereddened to the ctts locus .",
    "the ctts locus is only valid for stellar mass objects with spectral types earlier than m6 which corresponds roughly to the temperature of an object near the hydrogen ",
    "burning limit for the age of the cluster . for objects that lie within the reddened main sequence in the color  color diagram , as well as those within the ctts locus whose",
    "dereddened m@xmath50 suggest a mass below 0.1 m@xmath6 , the reddening was estimated by projecting objects in the color  magnitude diagram to an isochrone consistent with the cluster age derived above from the h ",
    "r diagram .    once the extinction has been estimated , then the absolute j  band magnitude can be calculated . using intrinsic colors and bolometric corrections for very late  type dwarf stars ( see appendix a in wgm99 ) , we transformed the dm models to estimate the mass from the absolute j magnitude . in order to define a complete sample",
    "unbiassed toward stars of higher mass , we defined an _ extinction ",
    "limited sample _ over a fixed mass range .",
    "adopting an age of 0.3 myr for the low mass cluster members as suggested by the spectroscopic observations , we sampled 46 objects down to 0.04 m@xmath6 with a@xmath51 13@xmath11 .",
    "this is the minimum mass for which we can reliably estimate an age from our spectroscopic survey .",
    "of these , two objects exhibit extreme infrared colors similar to flat  spectrum and class i sources in the taurus dark cloud ( cf . kenyon and hartmann , 1995 ) .",
    "these objects can not be dereddened and are removed from the sample . of the remaining 44 , five exhibit colors similar to early  type ( b  a ",
    "f ) ysos ( e.g. hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 ; lada and adams , 1992 ) , 12 are stellar mass objects within the reddened main sequence , 11 are stellar mass objects within the reddened ctts locus , and 16 are brown dwarf candidates .",
    "the total mass of stellar and substellar objects in this sample is about 8 m@xmath6 .",
    "for the 7 objects in common between the extinction - limited sample and the spectroscopic sample , mass estimates for individual objects agree to within a factor of 2 which is consistent with previous applications of this technique ( meyer 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the mean mass of the two samples is virtually identical ( within 10% ) emphasizing that the assumption of a common age yields a meaningful mass estimate for a statistically significant ensemble .",
    "the mass of gas associated this region where a@xmath51 13@xmath11 is estimated to be @xmath770 m@xmath6 .",
    "given the total mass of young stars , the efficiency of star formation would be 10% , with a factor of 2 uncertainty from the mass estimate alone .",
    "this value is consistent with that found in other young clusters and suggests the eventual dispersal of the cluster once the gas is removed ( carpenter 2000 ; lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the fraction of objects exhibiting ir excesses consistent with the presence of active accretion disks within 0.1 au of the star can be determined from an object s location in the color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "5 ) . within the a@xmath52limited sample of _ stellar _ mass objects defined here ( @xmath16 0.1 m@xmath6 ) , the fraction of ysos displaying an ir excess",
    "is @xmath53 adopting poisson errors .",
    "because some t tauri stars have large inner holes in their disks that removes hot dust associated with jhk excess emission , this inner disk fraction can underestimate the fraction of stars with active accretion disks .",
    "again , using the taurus dark cloud as a guide ( meyer 1997 ) , we estimate the corrected fraction of active accretion disks at @xmath54 .",
    "these estimates are in excellent agreement with those determined for the entire ngc 1333 cluster from the sqiid survey by lal and consistent with disk frequencies estimated for clusters of comparable age ( e.g. , haisch 2001 ) .",
    "we are not able to assess the disk frequency for the substellar sample using the jhk color  color diagram alone because the intrinsic colors of late type stars overlap those expected for active accretion disks .",
    "complete spectroscopic samples or longer wavelength photometry are required to assess the disk frequency of ensemble of the substellar objects in ngc 1333 .",
    "while our sample is not large enough to examine the detailed shape of the cluster s mass spectrum , we can explore its general properties . among stellar objects",
    ", we can calculate the ratio of intermediate mass ( 1 - 10 m@xmath6 ) to low mass ( 0.1 - 1 m@xmath6 ) stars .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 with the error computed assuming poisson statistics .",
    "this ratio is consistent with being drawn from the field star imf ( e.g. , miller & scalo 1979 ; kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1993 ) and is similar to @xmath56 values computed from other clusters such as the onc , mon r2 , rho ophiuchi , and ic 348 ( meyer 2000 ) .    turning to the subset of cluster members",
    "whose m@xmath50 suggests a mass below 0.1 m@xmath6 , we determine the ratio of stellar ( 0.1 - 1 m@xmath6 ) to substellar mass ( 0.04- 0.1 m@xmath6 ) objects within our extinction  limited sample .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 which is a lower limit given possible contamination of the substellar sample by field stars ( sec .",
    ". hence our value of @xmath58 sets an upper limit to the slope for the low mass end of the mass spectrum of @xmath31.6 where dn / dm @xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that the mass of the population in the mass range of 0.04 - 1 m@xmath6 is dominated by low mass stars and not brown dwarfs .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with values of @xmath44=12 derived from the observed distribution of l dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( reid 1999 ) .",
    "our upper limit is also consistent with the slopes derived for other young clusters ; these estimates range from @xmath44=0.43 for the onc ( hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ) and @xmath44=0.5 for ic 348 and @xmath21 oph ( najita 2000 ; luhman & rieke 1999 ) to @xmath44=0.8 to 1.2 for @xmath59 orionis cluster ( bjar 2001 ; tej 2002 ) .      if we instead take an age of 1 myr for the cluster associated with ngc 1333 , perhaps more appropriate for the mass range 0.12.5 m@xmath6 ( aspin 2003 ; luhman , priv . comm . ) , our results do not change significantly . a trend of increasing age with stellar mass is observed toward many young clusters ( e.g. , hillenbrand 1997 ) and it is suspected that this is a problem with the isochrones rather than evidence that the star formation rate varies with age _ and _ mass ( palla & stahler 1999 ) . for an age of 1 myr , our extinction ",
    "limited sample becomes 52 objects with a@xmath60 .",
    "of these , two have extreme colors similar to protostars and can not be dereddened as described above .",
    "of the 50 remaining objects in the sample , five have ir excesses similar to `` early  type '' stars , 14 are within the stellar reddened main sequence , 11 lie within the ctts locus , and 20 are brown dwarf candidates .",
    "the ir excess fraction is virtually unchanged with @xmath61 and with a corrected active accretion disk fraction of @xmath62 .",
    "the ratio of intermediate to low mass stars is @xmath63 which is also consistent with being drawn from the field star imf .",
    "this difference , although formally in agreement with the results obtained assuming an age of 0.3 myr , is to be expected given the luminosity evolution of pre - main - sequence stars over time .",
    "finally , the ratio of stellar to substellar mass objects is @xmath64 which implies an upper limit to the slope for the mass spectrum at low masses of @xmath652 . while formally consistent with the results quoted above , this highlights the sensitivity of our estimate of the substellar imf with age .",
    "we have conducted a new near - infrared survey of the northern cluster embedded in the ngc 1333 cloud . when combined with previous surveys , near - infrared magnitudes and colors",
    "were used to select 25 brown dwarf candidates in the high - extinction cloud core .",
    "low resolution infrared spectroscopy in the k band revealed cool photospheres for all of the candidates .",
    "spectral classifications were achieved using a water vapor index that is independent of reddening and insensitive to surface gravity in the range expected for subgiants and dwarfs .",
    "the derived spectral types varied between m2.3 and m8.2 , with 17 of 25 candidates displaying spectral types between m6.0 and m8.2 . based upon their superposition on the high extinction cloud core , their high incidence of x - ray activity , and the low number of foreground objects predicted by star count models",
    ", it is expected that at least 90% of the sample are very low mass members of the ngc 1333 cluster .",
    "once spectral types and effective temperatures were determined , stellar luminosities were estimated .",
    "comparisons of these properties with three sets of theoretical models suggest a median age for the sample of @xmath11 myr and a substellar mass for at least 9 of the candidates including the x - ray flare source asr  24 .",
    "another 7 candidates lie near the hydrogen - burning limit and are possible brown dwarfs .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our mass estimates arises from the effective temperature and the sensitivity of the temperature scale to surface gravity .",
    "we have shown that surface gravities estimated for the brown dwarf candidates more closely resemble dwarfs than giants for a given spectral type and hence a dwarf temperature scale is more appropriate than a giant temperature scale for young objects .",
    "finally , we have used our near - infrared survey to define an extinction - limited sample of ysos in the high - extinction core to investigate the properties of the northern cluster . for this sample of 44 objects ,",
    "the the fraction of objects exhibiting ir excesses is @xmath53 , in excellent agreement with previous estimates for this cluster and other clusters of comparable age .",
    "using masses estimated from intrinsic colors and absolute j magnitudes for very late  type dwarf stars and the 0.3 myr dm models , we find a mass spectrum for intermediate and low mass stars that is indistinguishable from that in other young clusters and the field star imf .",
    "due to the possible presence of background stars in the sample , only an upper limit to the slope of the mass spectrum at very low and substellar masses can be estimated .",
    "the slope of @xmath31.6 is consistent with that found for substellar objects in other young clusters and in the field .",

    "we note that the luminosity class for aw  psc is not well - determined .",
    "features in the giant spectra are distinct from those in the cluster member or dwarf star spectra . the giant star spectra are dominated by the co bandheads and display weak na i and ca i absorption lines .",
