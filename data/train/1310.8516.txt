    "although a non - orientable surface can not embed in the @xmath3-sphere , an orientable @xmath3-manifold @xmath2 can contain non - orientable surfaces , as long as @xmath8 is non - zero . a classic paper of bredon and wood  @xcite determines the minimal genus of such a surface in a lens space @xmath7 , where the genus @xmath9 of a connected , non - orientable surface @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "we extend this investigation , using both classical techniques and heegaard floer gauge theory , to the setting where the surface is embedded in the interior of a homology cobordism @xmath12 between rational homology @xmath3-spheres ( @xmath13h@xmath14 ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this of course includes the special case of a product @xmath17 for @xmath2 a @xmath13h@xmath14 , and the special case when @xmath2 is a lens space is of particular interest in light of the bredon  wood results .",
    "the technique we employ to bound the genus via the g - signature theorem stems from massey s paper  @xcite ; our use of gauge theory is related to the paper of t.  lawson  @xcite and can be used to reproduce and extend the results of that paper .",

    "two differences between the @xmath0-dimensional setting and the @xmath3-dimensional one are worth noting .",
    "the first is that since @xmath18 embeds in @xmath0-space , there is no lower bound for the genus of an embedding in an arbitrary @xmath0manifold without some additional hypothesis .",
    "unless explicitly stated to the contrary , we henceforth assume that our embeddings are _ essential _ in the sense that @xmath19 the second is that the normal bundle of an embedding in a @xmath0-manifold is not determined by the homology class that it carries .",
    "the normal bundle is determined by the normal euler class , which is an integer that we denote by @xmath20 ; see section  [ s : prelim ] below for details .",
    "for instance , there are two standard embeddings of @xmath18 in @xmath21 , with euler classes @xmath22 . except in sections  [ s : prelim ] , [ s : sign ] , and [ s : top ] , which apply equally to locally flat embeddings in topological manifolds , all manifolds and embeddings will be assumed to be smooth .",
    "our main result gives a bound for the genus of an essential surface in a homology cobordism @xmath12 between rational homology spheres @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "( this follows from the work of ni and wu on rational genus @xcite , as described in section  [ s : rational ] ; a purely number - theoretic proof appears in the appendix to this paper , written by ira gessel . )",

    "see corollary [ c : simple ] below for a more general statement .",
    "the idea of twisting a spin@xmath23 structure also works in a closed definite @xmath0-manifold , and we obtain bounds for the genus of a smoothly embedded surface @xmath10 in terms of the euler class and mod @xmath27 homology class carried by @xmath10 . in the special case",
