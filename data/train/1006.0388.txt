    "in the paper @xcite , t.  koslowski introduced kinematical representations for loop quantum gravity in which there is a non - degenerate spatial background metric present . in these representations ,",
    "the flux - operators of loop quantum gravity ( encoding quantized spatial geometry ) acquire a c - number term in addition to the standard one : @xmath0 the quantity @xmath1 is exactly the classical value of the flux in a background geometry given by a densitized triad @xmath2 .",
    "the possibility of such representations was known to some experts before @xcite ( they were mentioned for example in passing in @xcite ) but they were not considered interesting , because they did not alleviate the asymmetry in fluctuations between the canonical variables , and because gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms could not be implemented unitarily .",
    "the remarkable discovery of @xcite is that the transformations _ can _ be implemented if one is willing to go to a large direct sum of such representations , and that , even better , the corresponding constraints can then be implemented .",
    "the goal of the present article is to round off the picture that is emerging in @xcite , by showing that geometric operators can be defined in the new representations _ exactly _ as in the standard representation , and that they have a very simple structure .",
    "for example we find for the volume operator of a region @xmath3 that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the classical volume of @xmath3 in the spatial background geometry .",
    "additionally we discuss the implementation of gau and diffeomorphism constraint , using exactly the same techniques as in the standard representation .",
    "this adds some detail and clarifications to the treatment in @xcite . finally @xcite was using an algebra for loop quantum gravity that many researchers may not be very familiar with . here",
    "we will work with the standard formalism .",
    "as for the significance of these representations , we believe that they are not as fundamental as the standard representation .",
    "the latter shows how geometry can emerge from literally nothing , and it beautifully explains the black hole entropy - area relation , and more .",
    "the new representations , by contrast , are based on a classical geometry as input .",
    "still they may be useful in some form of perturbative calculation , in which a huge number of elementary geometric excitations are subsumed into the classical background .",
    "we should point out that the new representations are treating the two canonically conjugate quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 very differently , in much the same way as the standard representation does .",
    "the states in the new representations , when viewed as functions of @xmath7 , are sharply peaked around a classical spatial geometry , whereas they are almost constant when viewed as functions of the conjugate variable @xmath6 . in this sense",
    "they fail to approximately describe a classical _ space - time_. they only approximately describe a classical _ spatial _ geometry .",
    "while it would be very interesting to distribute the quantum mechanical uncertainty more evenly , and thus introduce also a classical background connection , the states considered here do not do that , and it is also not straightforward to generalize them in such a way that they do .",
    "it is however conceivable be that they can be taken as the ingredients of some form of limiting procedure , to obtain states that encode a full space - time geometry .",
    "we should also remark that the new representations , as well as those obtained from them for the purpose of unitarily implementing the spatial diffeomorphisms are _ not _ counterexamples to the uniqueness theorems @xcite on representations of the kinematical algebra .",
    "in both cases , crucial hypotheses are violated : as we will see in the next section , there is no unitary implementation of the the action of spatial diffeomorphisms on the basic variables in the new representations .",
    "and in the larger spaces that do admit such a unitray implementation , the representation is highly reducible .    in the next section ,",
    "we recall the definition of the new representations from @xcite and state some elementary properties .",
    "then we investigate the geometric operators in section [ se_geo ] . in sections",
    "[ se_uni ] and [ se_imp ] we discuss implementations of gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms , and of the constraints .",
    "we finish with some discussion and outlook .",
    "to fix notation , we will start by reviewing the standard lqg quantum kinematics .",
    "the canonical pair to be quantized consists of an su(2 ) connection @xmath6 and a densitized triad field @xmath7 .",
    "these fields transform under the automorphisms of the su(2 ) bundle . upon choosing ( local ) trivializations ,",
    "these bundle automorphisms split into gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms .",
    "the automorphism group is then the semi - direct product of those subgroups , @xmath8 with @xmath9 gauge transformations , @xmath10 diffeomorphisms , and the automorphism @xmath11 on the group of gauge transformations given by the push - forward under diffeomorphisms .",
    "the fields then transform under gauge transformations @xmath12 and diffeomorphisms @xmath13 in the standard way : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the adjoint action of su(2 ) on su(2 ) , and the star signifies push - forward .",
    "the basic variables used for quantization are chosen in such a way as to make their transformation behavior under su(2 ) and spatial diffeomorphisms as simple and transparent as possible .",
    "for the connection , one considers holonomies @xmath16=\\mathcal{p } \\exp \\int_{\\alpha } a,\\ ] ] or more generally , functions of such holonomies , @xmath17\\equiv t(h_{\\alpha_1}[a],h_{\\alpha_2}[a],\\ldots , h_{\\alpha_n}[a])\\ ] ] for a finite number of paths @xmath18 forming a graph , and a function @xmath19 on coupys of su(2 ) .",
    "such functionals are also called _",
    "cylindrical functions_.    for the field @xmath7 a natural functional is its flux through surfaces @xmath20 : @xmath21=\\int_s * e_i f^i\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a function taking values in su(2)@xmath23 and @xmath24 is the two - form @xmath25 .",
    "the action of gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms on @xmath26 induces a representation on cylindrical functions and fluxes .",
    "it is given by @xmath27= t(g(s1)^{-1}h_{\\alpha_1}g(e1 ) , g(s2)^{-1}h_{\\alpha_2}g(e2),\\ldots)\\\\ & ( \\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}t)[a]= t(h_{\\phi(\\alpha_1)}[a],h_{\\phi(\\alpha_2)}[a],\\ldots)\\\\ & ( g\\operatorname{\\triangleright}e_{s , f})=e_{s,\\operatorname{ad}_g(f)}\\\\ & ( \\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}e_{s , f})=e_{\\phi(s),\\phi_*f }   \\label{eq_act4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 the function on su(2)@xmath28 characterizing the cylindrical functional @xmath29 according to .",
    "to quantize cylindrical functions and fluxes , one is seeking a representation of the following algebraic relations on a hilbert space : @xmath30&=t_1[a]t_2[a]\\\\    [ t , e_{s , f}]&= 8\\pi \\iota l^2_p x_{s , f}[t]\\\\    [ t,[e_{s_1,f_1 } , e_{s_2,f_2}]]&=(8\\pi \\iota l^2_p)^2[x_{s_1,f_1 } , x_{s_2,f_2}][t ]   \\\\",
    "\\ldots & \\\\    ( e_{s , f})^*=e_{s,\\overline{f}},\\quad&\\quad    ( t[a])^*=\\overline{t}[a ]    \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 is a certain derivation on the space of cylindrical functions . these relations",
    "define an algebra .",
    "diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations act as automorphisms .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space @xmath32 is a space of functionals over the space of generalized connections @xmath33 .",
    "the fluxes are represented by derivatives @xmath34 , @xmath35 cylindrical functions act by multiplication .",
    "gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms ( and their semi - direct product ) are unitarily implemented by the operators @xmath36 this representation is called _ ashtekar - lewandowski representation_. in the present article , we will also use the term _ vacuum representation _ , to contrast it with the new representations , which can be thought of as representations containing a `` geometry condensate '' @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the new representations @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a classical triad field .",
    "then , following koslowski we define the new representation on _ the same _ hilbert space as before , by changing the action of the fluxes : @xmath37 it is easily checked that this gives another representation of the algebra .",
    "we list some elementary properties .    1 .",
    "the spectra of the fluxes have changed .",
    "if @xmath38 is an eigenvalue of @xmath34 then @xmath39 is an eigenvalue of @xmath40 . in particular ,",
    "a constant cylindrical function is now an eigenfunction of @xmath40 with in general non - vanishing eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "the new representation is still cyclic , with the empty spin net as cyclic vector .",
    "the new representation is unitarily inequivalent to the standard one .",
    "the operators implementing diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations in the standard representation are still well defined and unitary in the new representation , but it can be easily checked that they do not implement the algebra - automorphisms anymore . for example @xmath41 in general .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath42 do not change the background geometry .",
    "] by virtue of the fact that the @xmath42 act on the @xmath34 in the standard way , but commute with the new c - number term . ]",
    "5 .   the standard kinematical representation can be viewed as a special case of the new one , for @xmath43 .",
    "we note that point 5 is an empediment to the implementation of the gauge and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "it is also the reason that the new representations are not counterexamples to the uniqueness theorems @xcite , since the latter require the implementation of the action  on the basic operators .",
    "we note again that in the new representations , the operators representing the connection remain untouched",
    ". one might wonder whether it is possible to obtain representations in which also a background connection is used .",
    "a straightforward way to proceed would be as follows : the new representations from above can be obtained by applying a translation @xmath44 to the functionals @xmath45 of . a similar translation",
    ", @xmath46 is possible on the connection , where @xmath47 is a suitable fixed tensor field .",
    "the difference is that the translation on the triad field , when applied to the functional @xmath45 , leads to a functional of the same type ( flux plus constant term ) , whereas the translation on the connections turns a holonomy into a very complicated functional of the connection .",
    "thus this translation leads out of the algebra of functionals that is the basis for loop quantum gravity and can thus not be used to define new states .    in the following section we will consider the existence and properties of the geometric operators for area and volume in the new representation .",
    "we then turn to the implementation of diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations , and to the implementation of the corresponding constraints .",
    "in this section , we will show that area and volume operators can be defined in the new representations with exactly the same regularization and quantization strategy ( @xcite ) as in the vacuum representation .",
    "this simplifies the treatment in @xcite , in which a new volume operator was used .",
    "also , we extend the results about expectation values of the area operator obtained there . in fact , we make the structure of area and volume operator completely explicit .",
    "it is very simple .",
    "the action of the geometric operators in the new representations is given as a sum of two terms .",
    "one term is precisely the action in the vacuum representation , the other one is given as the value of the geometric quantity in the background geometry @xmath2 times the identity operator .",
    "the standard regularization and quantization procedures for area and volume operators can be applied to the new representations and lead to well defined operators .",
    "we find @xmath48 with @xmath49 the geometric operators in the vacuum representation , and @xmath50 the classical values in the background geometry .",
    "this result has a very simple form , but it is by no means trivial",
    ". a priori , coupling terms between geometry excitations and background could have appeared , or the regularization procedures could have broken down completely",
    ". we will have to work somewhat to exclude both possibilities .",
    "the result is remarkable in that it suggests a split into a background part ( the c - number term ) and fluctuations ( represented by the vacuum operators ) , and thus a physical interpretation of the states in the new representations as excitations above a background spatial geometry",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that this split is a result of the application of the standard quantization procedure @xcite to the new representations , not an assumption .",
    "as we have already done in stating the result , from now on we will drop all the @xmath51 s indicating the representation .",
    "we hope that it is clear from context .",
    "sometimes , we may add an index @xmath52 to denote an object in the vacuum representation , for clarity .",
    "let us first consider the area operator .",
    "the whole calculation is modeled on @xcite , so we refer to that reference for further background .",
    "we pick a surface @xmath20 and consider a family of non - negative densities @xmath53 on @xmath20 that has the property @xmath54 @xmath55 is the delta - function on @xmath20 which is peaked at @xmath56 .",
    "we also introduce the shorthands @xmath57 and @xmath58 then we can define @xmath59 as in @xcite , we would like to define @xmath60 and study its properties .",
    "it can be seen immediately that @xmath61 is essentially self adjoint on cylindrical functions , and positive semidefinite .",
    "therefore taking its square root is not a problem .",
    "rather , what we have to worry about is the limit in .",
    "the structure of @xmath61 is @xmath62 where the first term is the standard term .",
    "to see what the additional terms give , the first step is to go to a basis of eigenvectors for both , the @xmath63 and the @xmath64 term .",
    "we can consider the case of a single intersection vertex @xmath65 ( see figure [ fi_area ] ) , as the more general case can be handled by first subdividing the surface and considering the individual area operators separately .",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 can be diagonalized simultaneously . for",
    "a common eigenvector @xmath66 , one finds @xmath67 and @xmath68 here @xmath69 and @xmath70 are with respect to the metric on su(2 ) .",
    "the values @xmath71 and @xmath72 can obtain are determined by the representation labels on the edges intersecting at @xmath65 .",
    "thus we find for the regulated area operator @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ , \\text{d}p\\,\\,\\psi\\\\ & = \\int_s \\left[\\left(\\sqrt{\\alpha } f_{p}^\\epsilon(v)+|{e^{(0)}}{}_{\\epsilon}(p)|\\right)^2   + ( \\beta-\\sqrt{\\alpha})|{e^{(0)}}{}_{\\epsilon}(p)|f_{p}^\\epsilon(v ) \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ , \\text{d}p\\,\\,\\psi\\\\ & = : \\int_s \\left[a_\\epsilon+b_\\epsilon\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ , \\text{d}p\\,\\,\\psi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find the limit of the integral as @xmath74 , we use the fact that for @xmath75 @xmath76 where we have additionally assumed @xmath77 in the second pair of inequalities .",
    "we want to apply these inequalities to the integrand .",
    "@xmath78 is manifestly non - negative , but we do not know the sign of @xmath79 . in case",
    "it is negative , we still know that @xmath80 by virtue of the fact that the operator @xmath81 is non - negative . thus the inequalities apply , with @xmath82,@xmath83 .",
    "to finish the calculation , we note that @xmath84 for @xmath85 on the other hand , we note that the integrand is a product of @xmath86 and a bounded function .",
    "one can readily show that the integral therefore converges to zero , @xmath87 using the inequalities , we thus have @xmath88 the @xmath89 term is the one appearing in the vacuum representation , the second term is precisely the area of @xmath20 in the background .",
    "we will now turn to the volume operator .",
    "we refer to @xcite for motivation and details about the chosen regularization .",
    "we will now describe the aspects of it that are relevant for our purpose .",
    "we are considering the volume of a region @xmath3 .",
    "the regularization procedure consists in subdividing the region @xmath3 into smaller and smaller cubes . for",
    "any given cube @xmath90 , one defines three orthogonal surfaces @xmath91 and the phase space function @xmath92=\\frac{1}{3!}\\eta_{abc}\\epsilon_{ijk}e^i_{s_a}e^j_{s_b}e^k_{s_c}\\ ] ] with @xmath93 the totally anti - symmetric pseudo density .",
    "the volume is recovered as @xmath94 where the limit indicated is that of the subdivision into cubes getting finer and finer .",
    "this regularization leads the way to quantization , as @xmath95 of can immediately be quantized by replacing the classical flux quantities by their quantum counterparts .",
    "the limit in is taken in such a way that the vertices of a graph underlying a state to be acted upon end up in the bulk and not on the boundary of the cubes .",
    "it turns out that once the subdivision is fine enough , the operator action on a given state stabilizes .",
    "thus the limit down to cubes of coordinate - volume pulled back via a coordinate chart ] zero does not have to be carried out explicitly . in an additional step ,",
    "the resulting operator is averaged in a certain way , to rid it of a remaining dependence on the subdivision and the positions of the surfaces inside the cubes .    in the vacuum representation ,",
    "only cubes that contain a ( three or higher valent ) vertex contribute in the sum over cubes in .",
    "as we will show , this is no longer true in the new representations , and we will have to show that this does not lead to a blow - up of the sum in the limit of finer and finer subdivision . indeed considering a fixed cube @xmath90 , we will have @xmath96=\\frac{1}{3!}\\eta_{abc}\\epsilon_{ijk } ( x^i_{s_a } + { e^{(0)}}{}^i_{s_a } )   ( x^j_{s_b}+{e^{(0)}}{}^j_{s_b } ) ( x^k_{s_c}+{e^{(0)}}{}^k_{s_c}),\\ ] ] thus apart from the @xmath97 term that was present in the vacuum representation , we also have terms @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "to further analyze the situation , we consider states based on a graph @xmath101 and assume that the subdivision into cubes is already fine enough such that each cube in the sum in is of one of the following types ( see also figure [ fi_volume ] ) :    1 .",
    "a cube is of _ type 0 _ if it is not intersected by any edge of the graph @xmath101 .",
    "a cube is of _ type 1 _ if it is intersected by one edge of the graph @xmath101 , and this intersection is in such a way that precisely one of the surfaces",
    "@xmath102 internal to the cube is intersected transversally .",
    "a cube is of _ type 2 _ if it contains precisely one vertex , and such that precisely two of the surfaces @xmath102 internal to the cube are intersected transversally by the edges emanating from the vertex .",
    "a cube is of _ type 3 _ if it contains precisely one vertex , and such that all three surfaces @xmath102 internal to the cube are intersected transversally by the edges emanating from the vertex .",
    "thus we can write @xmath103 let @xmath104 be the order of magnitude of the coordinate - volume of the region @xmath3 , and @xmath105 the typical coordinate - volume of a cube .",
    "when refining the subdivision into cubes , the total number @xmath106 of cubes in the sum in thus goes like @xmath107 .",
    "but the number of cubes of the different types behaves very differently : the number of cubes of type 0 make up the bulk and go as @xmath107 .",
    "the number of cubes of type 1 goes as @xmath108 since the edges are one - dimensional objects .",
    "finally there are only finitely many cubes of type 2 and 3 , since there are only finitely many vertices .",
    "let us consider the action of @xmath95 for @xmath90 a cube of type 2 or 3 : schematically @xmath109 but @xmath2 goes as @xmath110 , so we have @xmath111 and thus , since the sum is finite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the volume operator from the vacuum representation , before the averaging to remove the remaining regularization dependence .",
    "next we consider a cube @xmath90 of type 0 .",
    "we obviously have @xmath114 and hence , because of @xmath115 where @xmath5 is the volume in the background geometry .",
    "finally , we will show that the sum over cubes of type 1 does not contribute in the limit . to that end",
    ", we note that for @xmath90 of type 1 , schematically @xmath116 since @xmath2 is going like @xmath110 , we have that @xmath117 is converging to a finite operator .",
    "but then @xmath118 is a sum over @xmath119 vectors , each with norm of order @xmath110 , and hence this sum converges to zero in the limit of @xmath120 going to zero .",
    "thus we have proven that @xmath121 as desired .",
    "finally , we have to carry out the averaging procedure , but this is now trivial .",
    "the end result is a volume operator @xmath122 with @xmath123 being the well known volume operator in the vacuum representation .",
    "now we consider the implementation of the automorphisms of the su(2 ) principal fiber bundle underlying the whole formalism .",
    "we will follow exactly the treatment by koslowski @xcite .",
    "as is customarily done , we discuss the automorphisms induced by diffeomorphisms and the gauge transformations separately . also in this section ( and in all the following as well ) , we will drop all the @xmath51 s indicating the representation .",
    "we hope that it is clear from context in which representation we work .",
    "the first observation is that the unitary operators that implement diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations in the vacuum representation are still well defined and unitary in the new representations .",
    "the problem is that they do not implement those transformations anymore . for a gauge transformation @xmath12 and",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath13 we have @xmath124 vice versa , it can be shown that if families of operators @xmath125 and @xmath126 implement the gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms , respectively , most of those operators can not be unitary .",
    "the problem is evidently that the background geometry present in the new representations is immutable by operations on the hilbert space and thus prevents unitary implementations of diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations .",
    "this problem can be solved by enlarging the hilbert space in such a way that also the background geometries can be transformed , as was already observed in @xcite .    for a given background @xmath2",
    "we consider the hilbert space @xmath127}:=\\bigoplus_{{{\\widetilde{e}}^{(0)}}\\in [ { e^{(0 ) } } ] } \\mathcal{h}_{{{\\widetilde{e}}^{(0)}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 $ ] is the equivalence class of @xmath2 with respect to diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations .",
    "the hilbert space is thus effectively labeled by a spatial background metric modulo diffeomorphisms .",
    "we will write @xmath129 for the cylindrical state @xmath29 in the ( new ) representation with background geometry @xmath130 in the above hilbert space .",
    "thus we have @xmath131 where the first scalar product on the right hand side is just the one in the vacuum representation .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath132}$ ] carries a representation of the lqg algebra , which is simply the direct sum of the representations on the individual spaces .",
    "but now one can implement the diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations unitarily , by setting @xcite @xmath133 we have to check that this definition gives a unitary representation , and implements the transformations on operators correctly .",
    "that it is a representation follows from the fact that the various actions @xmath134 involved are all representations .",
    "that it is unitary is immediately seen from the fact that both , the vacuum scalar product , and the kronecker delta used in are invariant under gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms .",
    "it is easy to show that with this definition , the transformations are also correctly implemented on the operators .",
    "we give the example of the diffeomorphisms .",
    "we calculate @xmath135\\\\ & = { \\lvert\\ , ( \\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}x_{s , f } ) ( \\phi \\operatorname{\\triangleright}t),\\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rangle } + { e^{(0)}}_{s , f}{\\lvert\\ , \\phi \\operatorname{\\triangleright}t,\\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}\\\\ & = \\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}e_{s , f } { \\lvert\\ , \\phi \\operatorname{\\triangleright}t,\\phi\\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have used the fact that @xmath136 and that the integral simply evaluates to @xmath1 since both , integrand and integration region are pushed forward with @xmath13 . from this we read off , that @xmath137 for a cylindrical function , the calculation is even simpler : @xmath138 from which we read off @xmath139 a similar calculation can be carried out for the gauge transformations , showing that they , too , are implemented on operators correctly .",
    "finally , a straightforward calculation shows that not only the groups of gauge transformations and spatial diffeomorphisms are correctly implemented , but also their direct product .",
    "if one sets @xmath140 one finds @xmath141 we have thus shown that the action of the bundle automorphisms on the basic variables of the theory are represented in an anomaly - free way .",
    "this in turn means that the hypersurface - algebra corresponding to the bundle automorphisms is represented in an anomaly - free way .",
    "the situation with respect to the constraint algebra is thus precisely the same as in the vacuum representation , and we are set to tackle the implementations of the constraints with the same methods as in the vacuum case .    in",
    ", the subspaces corresponding to different backgrounds are specified to be orthogonal to each other .",
    "the reader may wonder whether a different choice would be permissible , such that the inner product between states with the same background is unchanged , but states with different backgrounds are not necessarily orthogonal to each other .",
    "it is however easy to see that the above choice is the only one that renders @xmath45 self - adjoint .",
    "we finally remark that the representation of the kinematical algebra of loop quantum gravity on the hilbert space @xmath132}$ ] is not a counter example to the uniqueness results @xcite , despite the fact that it carries a unitary implementation of the bundle automorphisms .",
    "the theorems require a cyclic representation , but the representation on @xmath132}$ ] is highly reducible , the direct sum decomposition in giving a decomposition into invariant subspaces .",
    "now we are looking at the implementation of the constraints . the natural expectation would be that implementing the constraints using the new representations is not possible , since they contain background geometry .",
    "but this is not the case , as was realized in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the diffeomorphism constraint can be implemented exactly as in the vacuum - representation .",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated for the gau constraint , as we will explain below .",
    "with hindsight , it is not too surprising that the implementation of the constraints succeeds .",
    "implementing them is not about ridding the states of background _ per se _ , but ridding them of coordinate and gauge dependence .",
    "we will first consider the implementation of the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "then we will turn to the gau constraint .",
    "finally we will consider states that satisfy both classes of constraints .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint can be implemented on vectors in @xmath132}$ ] with _ exactly _ the same strategy as in the vacuum representation . as far as we understand , this is also the strategy used in @xcite , but we will spell out more details",
    ". we will borrow notation from @xcite and urge the reader to consult the reference for additional information about the standard treatment .    to start with",
    ", we make some definitions . we will call a diffeomorphism @xmath13 a symmetry of a triad @xmath2 , if @xmath13 leaves @xmath7 invariant , @xmath142 .",
    "invariant up to a gauge transformation .",
    "these will be relevant in section [ se_imp_aut ] ] . then    1 .",
    "let @xmath143 be the group of all diffeomorphisms .",
    "2 .   let @xmath144 be the group of diffeomorphisms that are symmetries of @xmath2 and map the graph @xmath71 onto itself .",
    "note : if @xmath43 these are just the diffeomorphisms mapping @xmath71 onto itself ( denoted @xmath145 in @xcite .",

    "p_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0)}})}^\\dagger u^\\dagger_\\phi \\ , \\vert \\ , t_\\beta , { e'^{(0)}}\\rangle}\\ ] ] where the projection @xmath153 is defined as @xmath154\\in \\operatorname{symm}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } } u_\\phi{\\lvert\\ , t_\\alpha,{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] now we have to demonstrate that these definitions makes sense , i.e.  that they are well defined and give finite results , and that @xmath151 is indeed a diffeomorphism invariant state .",
    "we will first address the issue of the the notions being well defined : if we chose , instead of @xmath13 a different member @xmath155 of the equivalence class @xmath156 $ ] on the right hand side of , we will have @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is in @xmath146 .",
    "but then @xmath159 because @xmath158 leaves the state invariant by definition .",
    "when we chose a different representative @xmath155 on the right hand side of , this can be equivalently written as using the original @xmath13 , but then @xmath160 in place of @xmath13 in , where @xmath161 is in @xmath146 .",
    "but it is immediately shown , that this does not change the result of @xmath153 . finally , it is easy to show that , due to the division by the size of @xmath148 , the above is invariant under subdivision of edges of @xmath71 .",
    "the next comment is on finiteness .",
    "we first show :    @xmath148 is finite .",
    "@xmath144 is a subset of @xmath162",
    ". therefore elements of @xmath148 will consist of elements of @xmath162 .",
    "we know that @xmath163 is finite .",
    "we ask : can two elements @xmath10 of @xmath144 that are in the same class in @xmath163 be in different classes in @xmath148 ? if the answer is ` no ' , then @xmath148 can have at most as many classes as @xmath163 , and the lemma is proven . to show that this is indeed the case , take @xmath10 in @xmath144 and in the same class in @xmath163 , i.e.@xmath164 but then @xmath165 , and @xmath144 is a group , so @xmath166 is also in @xmath144 .",
    "thus classes in @xmath163 are not split over classes in @xmath148 , and thus the lemma is proven .",
    "thus @xmath153 is a finite projection .",
    "finally we remark that while the sum in is infinite , only finitely many terms are non - zero , due to the fact that the sum is effectively only over diffeomorphisms that act no - trivial on the state @xmath167 , and the scalar product is only nonzero , if the backgrounds and graphs in the scalar product coincide _ exactly_.    finally , let us demonstrate that the functional @xmath151 is indeed diffeomorphism invariant . to this end , consider @xmath168 where @xmath158 is an arbitrary diffeomorphism .",
    "if we write out the sums , we get an expression of the form @xmath169\\in\\operatorname{diff}/\\operatorname{diff}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } }   \\sum_{[\\phi']\\in \\operatorname{symm}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } }   { \\langle\\ldots\\ , \\vert \\ , u^\\dagger_{\\phi ' } u^\\dagger_{\\phi}u_\\omega \\ , \\vert \\ , \\ldots\\rangle}.\\ ] ] but since @xmath143 is a group and @xmath144 acts from the right , we have that @xmath169\\in\\operatorname{diff}/\\operatorname{diff}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } } u^\\dagger_{\\omega^{-1}\\circ\\phi}= \\sum_{[\\phi]\\in\\operatorname{diff}/\\operatorname{diff}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } } u^\\dagger_{\\phi}\\ ] ] and hence @xmath170 as it should be .",
    "the definition of the inner product on the diffeomorphism invariant states now proceeds exactly as in the vacuum case , and leads to a diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space @xmath132}^{\\operatorname{diff}}$ ] .",
    "we emphasize that the construction is such that for the fully degenerate background geometry @xmath43 , we have @xmath171}^{\\operatorname{diff}}=\\mathcal{h}^{\\operatorname{diff}}$ ] , where the latter is the ( standard ) diffeomorphism - invariant hilbert space of the vacuum representation .",
    "now we come to the implementation of the gau constraint . here",
    "our treatment will differ somewhat from @xcite .",
    "we will comment on the differences below .",
    "also , we find that we can not blindly follow the strategy used in the vacuum representation : there , implementation of the constraint can be done by group averaging involving an _ integral _ over the group of gauge transformations . while this group is huge , since there are only finitely many vertices involved in any given graph , the integral boils down to finitely many integrals over su(2 ) and",
    "is thus well defined . in our context , since gauge transformation may act non - trivially on all of @xmath2 , it is unclear how to extend this treatment to the new representations .",
    "instead one might be tempted to follow the strategy that was used in the case of the diffeomorphism constraint . there , a _ sum _ over the group elements was performed .",
    "now , since a gauge transform of a state may not be orthogonal to the state itself in the vacuum representation , one might suspect that this strategy runs into problems with convergence .",
    "indeed , this is the case . to see this , we try to define @xmath172 where @xmath173 are the gauge transformation that are a symmetry of @xmath2 ( i.e. leave @xmath2 invariant ) and leave @xmath29 invariant .",
    "the problem with this is that the sum may contain infinitely many @xmath12 which change @xmath29 but leave @xmath2 invariant .",
    "think for example of gauge transformations that are rotations with axis @xmath2 at each point .",
    "such transformations will still generically change a given functional @xmath29 . when evaluating @xmath174 on a state @xmath175 with @xmath176 gauge invariant and @xmath177 , each transformation that fixes @xmath2 but changes @xmath29 will produce the same non - vanishing number , leading to a divergence .",
    "the problem described above can be avoided if one starts with gauge invariant functionals @xmath29 .",
    "then obviously there are no gauge transformations that change @xmath29 and leave @xmath2 invariant .",
    "let @xmath178 be the group of gauge transformations that are symmetries of @xmath2 .",
    "for a gauge invariant @xmath29 we set @xmath179 this is obviously gauge invariant , and evaluated on a state there can be at most one non - zero term : @xmath180 we emphasize that the construction is such that for the fully degenerate background geometry @xmath43 , we have @xmath171}^{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{g}}}=\\mathcal{h}^{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{g}}}$ ] , where the latter is the ( standard ) gauge - invariant hilbert space of the vacuum representation .    we also note that ( in view of ) , an orthonormal basis of @xmath132}^{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{g}}}$ ] can be given as follows : first , since @xmath181 depends on @xmath2 only through the gauge equivalence class @xmath128 $ ] , we might as well denote it by @xmath182\\}$ ] .",
    "then a basis is given by @xmath183\\}\\,\\}$ ] , where @xmath29 runs through all spin nets , and @xmath128 $ ] through all gauge equivalence classes .",
    "we now come to the difference with @xcite .",
    "koslowski puts forward the idea , that one should also consider states in which the connection is coupled to the background , as these can be gauge invariant , too .",
    "take for example the case of a loop @xmath71 with endpoint @xmath56 , and consider the functional @xmath184 = \\operatorname{tr}\\left(h_\\alpha[a]{e^{(0)}}(p)\\right).\\ ] ] this is invariant , provided both @xmath6 and @xmath2 transform under gauge transformations .",
    "but we do not see how this can be achieved in the present formalism : nothing prevents us from defining the state @xmath185,{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the functional defined above , but it is not gauge invariant . rather @xmath186,{e^{(0)}}\\rangle } = { \\lvert\\ , t[g^{-1 } \\,\\cdot\\ , g,{e^{(0)}}],g\\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rangle } = { \\lvert\\ , t[\\ , \\cdot\\ , , g \\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}],g \\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] instead , one might consider it more promising to start with the functional ( a treatment along these lines was probably implied in @xcite ) @xmath187,g \\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rvert}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath188 denotes the zero spin network .",
    "one can envision this functional as being obtained from the action of a hypothetical operator @xmath189 on the state @xmath190|",
    "\\equiv\\sum_{g\\in\\mathcal{g}/\\mathcal{g}_{{e^{(0)}}}}{\\langle\\ , 0,g \\operatorname{\\triangleright}{e^{(0)}}\\rvert}.\\ ] ] indeed , operators of this type have been considered in the early days of loop quantum gravity .",
    "one can check that defines functional on states , @xmath191\\ , \\vert \\ , t \\rangle } & \\text { if } { e'^{(0)}}\\in [ e]\\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }    \\end{cases}.\\ ] ] a straightforward calculation shows that this functional is also gauge invariant .",
    "it is , however , not an element of the diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space .",
    "this can be seen very easily as follows : while @xmath192 evaluates to something non - zero only on states @xmath193 where @xmath29 is not gauge invariant , all functionals in @xmath132}^{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{g}}}$ ] are non - zero only on states @xmath193 where @xmath29 _ is _ gauge invariant .",
    "thus , to give functionals such as a home , one would need a scalar product on them .",
    "this may be possible , for example by modifying the procedure suggested in in such a way that the sum is over a smaller set .",
    "this however risks to yield a non - gauge - invariant functional .",
    "to summarize , it may well possible  and this possibility is very exciting  to also introduce states that couple to the background , but this would necessitate a departure from the framework considered here ( and as far as we understand , also from the one in @xcite ) .      up to now",
    "we have considered diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations separately .",
    "now we want to show how one can obtain states that are invariant under their semidirect product , the bundle automorphisms .",
    "the idea is to first average over gauge transformations , then over diffeomorphisms .",
    "one has to be careful , however because there may be diffeomorphisms that are symmetries up to a gauge transformation . applying these to a gauge invariant functional and summing over them leads to an over - counting and , possibly , to a divergence .",
    "thus the averaging for the diffeomorphism invariant states has to be modified slightly .",
    "we denote by @xmath194 the group of diffeomorphisms that are symmetries of @xmath2 up to a gauge transformation , and map the graph @xmath71 onto itself .",
    "let @xmath195 be the group of diffeomorphisms that are symmetries of @xmath2 up to gauge transformations and map each edge of the graph @xmath71 onto itself .",
    "finally let @xmath196 be the quotient of the above .",
    "then , for a state @xmath197 with @xmath29 gauge invariant , the group averaging over diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations is @xmath198\\in\\operatorname{diff}/\\operatorname{giff}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } }   \\{t_\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } }    t_\\beta , { e'^{(0)}}\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath199\\in \\operatorname{gymm}_{(\\alpha,{e^{(0 ) } } ) } } u_\\phi{\\lvert\\ , t_\\alpha,{e^{(0)}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that this is well defined , with the same reasoning as given in section [ se_diff ] .",
    "the proof that @xmath200 is finite goes through exactly as before .",
    "it is also easy to see that evaluation is always finite .",
    "finally it is obvious that the resulting functional is invariant under both , diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations .",
    "in the present article , we have demonstrated how the new representations form a family with the ( standard ) vacuum representation being one member .",
    "this begs the question as to the significance and use of these representations .    as we have already stated before",
    ", we do not think that the new representations are as fundamental as the vacuum representation , because they contain so much classical background structure .",
    "still , it may be interesting to see in what sense they can be used to solve the hamiltonian constraint . on the one hand , one could take over thiemann s construction literally , and see whether the constraint is well defined , and how solutions would look .",
    "on the other hand the new representations allow for new quantization strategies , because the volume operator can now have non - vanishing kernel .",
    "likewise , we have preliminary indications that one may be able to define an operator corresponding to the integral of curvature over a surface .    all of this would also be interesting for applying the new representation in situations , in which one would like to treat most of the gravitational excitations as background , and only study in detail the excitations of geometry over this kind of geometric condensate .",
    "finally , the new representations could be a spring board to the construction of yet other representations which are more semiclassical .    on a more technical level",
    ", it may be interesting to study different types of backgrounds .",
    "when we were discussing the backgrounds @xmath2 the reader may have had a smooth , non - degenerate geometry in mind .",
    "but more general choices are also possible , as long as fluxes , areas and volumes are still well defined .",
    "possibilities include for example fields that are only non - vanishing on submanifolds .",
    "we hope to come back to some of the questions raised above , at another time .",
