    "the pulsar psr b1951 + 32 , located at the center of the morphologically peculiar radio nebula ctb 80 , is a 39.5-msec radio pulsar ( clifton et al .",
    "1987 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1988 ) with a characteristic age of @xmath5 yr and an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of @xmath6 g. an x - ray point source was observed within the x - ray nebula related to the radio core of ctb 80 ( becker , helfand & szymkowiak 1982 ; seward 1983 ; wang & seward 1984 ) .",
    "search for x - ray pulsation from this source with exosat yielded inconclusive evidence for pulsation ( confidence level of 97% , by gelman & buccheri 1987 , and 93% by angelini et al .",
    "the pulsed emission was detected by rosat at a 99% confidence level ( safi - harb , gelman & finley 1995 ) , which shows a single peak roughly consistent in phase with the radio emission .",
    "the overall spectrum of this point source in 0.1 - 2.4 kev is best fitted by a power law with a photon spectral index @xmath7 , and an estimated pulsed fraction of 0.35 .    the egret instrument on cgro observed and detected gamma - ray pulsation from psr b1951 + 32 above 100 mev ( ramanamurthy et al . 1995 ) , making it a member of egret hard gamma - ray pulsar family with a similar age to vela and geminga .",
    "the gamma - ray lightcurve shows two peaks at phase 0.16 and 0.60 with phase 0.0 being the radio peak .",
    "its spectrum in the egret energy range follows a power law with a photon spectral index of about @xmath8 ( ramanamurthy et al .",
    "1995 ; fierro 1995 ) over about two decades of photon energy .",
    "recently , pulsed emission is reported from the comptel instrument in the 0.75 - 10.0 mev band ( kuiper et al .",
    "the osse and batse instruments on cgro only reported upper limits of pulsed emission in the lower energy band ( schroeder et al.1995 ; wilson et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "there have been a number of models proposed to explain the gamma - ray emission with dramatically different emission sites , some at or very near the surface of the neutron star and some very far away .",
    "recently , ho & chang ( 1996 ) proposed a geometry - independent argument to constrain the possible site and mechanism of the gamma - ray emission based on the commonality of power - law emission in the egret ( and possibly comptel ) pulsars . in such arguments , it is important to know whether and how the gamma - ray power - law spectra turn over towards low energy .",
    "( see section 4 for more discussions . )    to gain better understanding of the overall spectral behavior , especially between kev and mev , we conducted an observation of psr b1951 + 32 using both pca and hexte on board rxte during cycle 1 .",
    "analysis of the 19k - second pca data does not yield conclusive evidence for pulsation from 2.0 to 13.0 kev .",
    "the derived 2-@xmath1 upper limits provide support for the hard turn - over for the high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "it also indicates that the soft x - ray pulsation observed by rosat has a very soft spectrum .",
    "we described the observation in section 2 .",
    "the analyses and results for the pca data are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the theoretical implications of this observation and future work in section 4 .",
    "the pca and hexte on board rxte were pointed at psr b1951 + 32 on march 24 , 1996 ( mjd 50166 ) , for about 10.5 hours including earth occultations . the rxte mission , spacecraft and instrument capabilities are described in swank et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , giles et al.(1995 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) the pca consists of five essentially identical pcus with a total effective area of 6729 @xmath9 , with no imaging capability .",
    "the field of view is one degree .    after examining the data ,",
    "two exclusions were applied to the data set .",
    "first , data from the pca pulse - height channel 36 - 255 ( 13.0 - 90.0 kev ) are excluded due to high instrumental noise .",
    "second , we observed unexplained anomalous increase during two intervals of our exposure . under the advice of rxte guest observer",
    "facility experts , data obtained during these two intervals were excluded . in the second half of the observation ,",
    "two of the five pcus were turned off .",
    "the overall usable data used for this analysis contain two segments of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for a total of @xmath12 , or equivalently , a total integration time of 19232 seconds and an average effective area of 5363.3 @xmath9 .    around the same epoch of the rxte observation ,",
    "psr b1951 + 32 was also monitored at jodrell bank radio observatory .",
    "the radio ephemeris is summarized in table 1 and used as the input for pulsation search .",
    "the data were reduced to the barycenter and analyzed using the jpl de200 ephemeris , the pulsar position listed in table  [ ephemeris ] , and standard rxte reduction package ( ftools v.3.5.2 and xanadu / xronos v.4.02 ) .",
    "lightcurve folding was performed separately for each of four typical energy bands and various combinations using the radio ephemeris in table  [ ephemeris ] .",
    "the four typical energy bands are commonly designated as band 1 through 4 , with each covering pca channels 0 - 13 ( 2.0 - 4.8 kev ) , 14 - 17 ( 4.8 - 6.3 kev ) , 18 - 23 ( 6.3 - 8.5 kev ) , and 24 - 35 ( 8.5 - 13.0 kev ) , respectively .",
    "none of the folded lightcurves showed significant deviation from a model steady distribution under the pearson s @xmath13-test ( leahy et al .",
    "1983a , b ) .",
    "specifically , the @xmath13 values for the folded lightcurves shown in figure  [ lightcurve ] are , for 19 degrees of freedom , 27.4 for band 1 , 21.1 for band 2 , and 8.38 for the combined band of 3 and 4 .",
    "in addition to instrumental and cosmic x - ray background , the dc component is mostly likely the contribution from the rosat point source and its associated x - ray nebula . to further ascertain the absence of pulsation",
    ", we performed the bin - independent parameter - free @xmath0-test ( de jager , swanepoel & raubenheimer 1989 ) . in this analysis ,",
    "all detected raw photons with the corrected arrival time are used .",
    "the @xmath0-test was applied to the data in different energy bands and various combinations .",
    "the results of the @xmath0-test all show high probability that the data are consistent with steady source except for band 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath0-values are 7.286 and 9.334 for bands 1 and 2",
    "( both at @xmath14=1 ) .",
    "this yields a 5.5% and 2.4% probability of being consistent with a steady source . applying the straight @xmath15-test ( the rayleigh test , which is more appropriate if the underlying pulse profile is sinusoidal )",
    ", the probability of the data being consistent with a steady source is 2.9% and 0.9% for bands 1 and 2 .",
    "based on these analyses , we do not consider the null probability , although intriguingly small using the @xmath0-test , provides conclusive evidence of pulsation from psr b1951 + 32 in the xte / pca energy band .",
    "the upper limit of pulsed flux is estimated following the prescription given by ulmer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . assuming a duty cycle of 0.5 and combining bands 2 and 3 to yield a comparable total number of counts to those in bands 1 and 4 individually , we obtain the following 2-@xmath1 upper limits , which are also shown in figure  [ spectrum ] : @xmath2 for 2.0 - 4.8 kev , @xmath3 for 4.8 - 8.5 kev , and @xmath16 for 8.5 - 13.0 kev .",
    "_ gamma - ray pulsar : _ the current xte / pca upper limits provide support to the combined cgro observation that the gamma - ray pulsed emission from psr b1951 + 32 follows a power law with a significant break towards low energy ( egret and comptel detection along with osse and batse upper limits ) , as indicated in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "such spectral behavior is seen in the vela and geminga pulsars . for psr b1951 + 32 , the break energy ( photon energy",
    "at which there is a significant break in photon spectral indices to , say , harder than @xmath17 ) is estimated to be between 70 kev and 3 mev . as noted in ho & chang ( 1996 ) , this common trait could play an important role in the theoretical modeling of this family of `` egret pulsars . ''",
    "the power law of these pulsars typically covers two orders of magnitude in the egret band with best - fit photon spectral indices in the range of @xmath18 to @xmath8 .",
    "these photon spectral indices can not be produced by a mono - energetic relativistic electron distribution under currently proposed radiation mechanisms .",
    "the most likely origin of this power - law behavior is the cooling ( energy loss ) through the dominant radiation mechanism responsible for the gamma - rays .",
    "for example , the most simplistic cooling model for a steady state electron distribution will yield a photon spectral index of @xmath19 for synchrotron radiation and @xmath20 for curvature radiation . the cooling spectrum will continue towards low energy until the electron distrbution ( in energy space ) is no longer affected by cooling : i.e. the cooling spectrum turns hard at the break energy which corresponds to the location and electron energy where the radiative cooling time scale is comparable to the dynamical time scale of the relativistic motion of the electrons .",
    "such an argument allows us to constrain the radiation mechanism and , more importantly , the emission site , which to date remains unsettled with great bifurcation among gamma - ray pulsar models .",
    "following this argument and examining various radiation mechanisms , we find that , for psr b1951 + 32 , the gamma - ray pulsations are most likely generated by synchrotron radiation with a typical pitch angle of 0.1 to 0.001 and emission site is about @xmath21 to @xmath22 cm from the star : i.e. in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "_ x - ray pulsar : _ safi - harb , gelman & finley ( 1995 ) reported rosat observation of psr b1951 + 32 with an estimated pulsed fraction of 0.35 and an overall spectrum following a power law with a photon spectral index of @xmath7 . to date , there is no published spectrum for the pulsed component .",
    "safi - harb et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated the soft x - ray pulsation duty cycle to be 0.1 .",
    "such a duty cycle will lower the xte upper limit estimated above .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ spectrum ] that the xte / pca observation necessitates a steep drop - off at around 2 kev for the pulsed component .",
    "this is consistent with safi - harb et al.s report of no pulsation near 2 kev .",
    "it is almost certain that , for psr b1951 + 32 , the rosat observed pulsation below 1.3 kev is separate from the egret / comptel observed gamma - ray pulsation .",
    "more than likely , they are from different origin and emitted at different location . in summary ,",
    "xte / pca observation over 19k seconds shows no definitive evidence of pulsation .",
    "the upper limits can be used to help constrain theoretical models .",
    "our analysis does show tantalizing hints .",
    "in addition to the small null probability from the @xmath0-test , the peaks for bands 1 and 2 in figure  [ lightcurve ] , taken at face value , are separated by 0.45 in phase , reminiscent to that of the geminga pulsar in 0.07 - 1.5 kev ( halpern & ruderman 1993 ) . a long exposure on xte , e.g. 100 ksecs , will provide better statistics and help advance our understanding of this and other similar pulsars .",
    "we thank the xte team in xte / gof at gsfc , especially james lochner , for their help in data reduction and analysis .",
    "we also thank andrew lyne for providing the radio ephemeris and comments on the manuscript .",
    "many useful discussions with ed fenimore and james theiler are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we are appreciative of the referee , f. seward , for his many helpful comments in improving this paper .",
    "this work was performed under the auspices of the us department of energy and was supported in part by the rxte guest observer program and cgro guest investigator program .",
