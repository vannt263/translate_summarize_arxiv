    "the scope of the growing field of complexity science `` ( or complex systems '' ) includes a broad variety of problems belonging to different scientific areas .",
    "examples for complex systems `` can be found in physics , biology , computer science , ecology , economy , sociology and other fields .",
    "a recurring theme in most of what is classified as complex systems '' is that of _ emergence_. emergent properties are those which arise spontaneously from the collective dynamics of a large assemblage of interacting parts .",
    "a basic question one asks in this context is how to derive and predict the emergent properties from the behavior of the individual parts .",
    "in other words , the central issue is how to extract large - scale , global properties from the underlying or microscopic degrees of freedom .    in the physical sciences ,",
    "there are many examples of emergent phenomena where it is indeed possible to relate the microscopic and macroscopic worlds .",
    "physical systems are typically described in terms of equations of motion of a huge number of microscopic degrees of freedom ( e.g. atoms ) .",
    "the microscopic dynamics is often erratic and complex , yet in many cases it gives rise to patterns with characteristic length and time scales much larger than the microscopic ones ( e.g. the pressure and temperature of a gas ) .",
    "these large scale patterns often posses the interesting , physically relevant properties of the system and one would like to model them or simulate their behavior . an important problem in physics is therefore to understand and predict the emergence of large scale behavior in a system , starting from its microscopic description .",
    "this problem is a fundamental one because most physical systems contain too many parts to be simulated directly and would become intractable without a large reduction in the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "a useful way to address this issue is to construct coarse - grained models , which treat the dynamics of the large scale patterns .",
    "the derivation of coarse - grained models from the microscopic dynamics is far from trivial . in most cases",
    "it is done in a phenomenological manner by introducing various ( often uncontrolled ) approximations .",
    "the problem of predicting emergent properties is most severe in systems which are modelled or described by _",
    "undecidable _ mathematical algorithms@xcite . for such systems",
    "there exists no computationally efficient way of predicting their long time evolution . in order to know the system s state after ( e.g. ) one million time steps one must evolve the system a million time steps or perform a computation of equivalent complexity .",
    "wolfram has termed such systems _ computationally irreducible _ and suggested that their existence in nature is at the root of our apparent inability to model and understand complex systems @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to conclude from this that the enterprise of physics itself is doomed from the outset ; rather than attempting to construct solvable mathematical models of physical processes , computational models should be built , explored and empirically analyzed .",
    "this argument , however , assumes that infinite precision is required for the prediction of future evolution .",
    "as we mentioned above , usually coarse - grained or even statistical information is sufficient . an interesting question that arises is therefore : is it possible to derive coarse - grained models of undecidable systems and can these coarse - grained models be decidable and predictable ?    in this work",
    "we address the emergence of large scale patterns in complex systems and the associated predictability problems by studying cellular - automata ( ca ) .",
    "ca are spatially and temporally discrete dynamical systems composed of a lattice of cells .",
    "they were originally introduced by von neumann and ulam @xcite in the 1940 s as a possible way of simulating self - reproduction in biological systems . since then , ca have attracted a great deal of interest in physics @xcite because they capture two basic ingredients of many physical systems : 1 ) they evolve according to a local uniform rule .",
    "2 ) ca can exhibit rich behavior even with very simple update rules .",
    "for similar and other reasons , ca have also attracted attention in computer science @xcite , biology @xcite , material science @xcite and many other fields . for a review on the literature on ca see refs .  .",
    "the simple construction of ca makes them accessible to computational theoretic research methods . using these methods it is sometimes possible to quantify the complexity of ca rules according to the types of computations they are capable of performing .",
    "this together with the fact that ca are caricatures of physical systems has led many authors to use them as a conceptual vehicle for studying complexity and pattern formation . in this work",
    "we adopt this approach and study the predictability of emergent patterns in complex systems by attempting to systematically coarse - grain ca .",
    "a brief preliminary report of our project can be found in ref .  .",
    "there is no unique way to define coarse - graining , but here we will mean that our information about the ca is locally coarse - grained in the sense of being stroboscopic in time , but that nearby cells are grouped into a supercell according to some specified rule ( as is frequently done in statistical physics ) . below we shall frequently drop the qualifier `` local '' whenever there is no cause for confusion .",
    "a system which can be coarse - grained is _ compact - able _ since it is possible to calculate its future time evolution ( or some coarse aspects of it ) using a more compact algorithm than its native description .",
    "note that our use of the term compact - able refers to the phase space reduction associated with coarse - graining , and is agnostic as to whether or not the coarse - grained system is decidable or undecidable .",
    "accordingly , we define _ predictable _ to mean that a system is decidable or has a decidable coarse - graining . thus , it is possible to calculate the future time evolution of a predictable system ( or some coarse aspects of it ) using an algorithm which is more compact than both the native and coarse - grained descriptions .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section [ ca_intro ]",
    "we give an introduction to ca and their use in the study of complexity . in section [ cg_procedure ]",
    "we present a procedure for coarse - graining ca .",
    "section [ cg_results ] shows and discusses the results of applying our procedure to one dimensional ca .",
    "most of the ca that we attempt to coarse - grain are wolfram s 256 elementary rules for nearest - neighbor ca .",
    "we will also consider a few other rules of special interest . in section [ kolmogorov_complexity ]",
    "we consider whether the coarse - grain - ability of many ca that we found in the elementary rule family is a common property of ca .",
    "using computational theoretic arguments we argue that the large scale behavior of local processes must be very simple .",
    "almost all ca can therefore be coarse - grained if we go to a large enough scale .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in [ conclusions ] .",
    "cellular automata are a class of homogeneous , local and fully discrete dynamical systems",
    ". a cellular automaton @xmath0 is composed of a lattice @xmath1 of cells that can each assume a value from a finite alphabet @xmath2 .",
    "we denote individual lattice cells by @xmath3 where the indexing reflects the dimensionality and geometry of the lattice .",
    "cell values evolve in discrete time steps according to the pre - prescribed update rule @xmath4 .",
    "the update rule determines a cell s new state as a function of cell values in a finite neighborhood .",
    "for example , in the case of a one dimensional , nearest - neighbor ca the update rule is a function @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] . at each time step",
    ", each cell in the lattice applies the update rule and updates its state accordingly . the application of the update rule is done in parallel for all the cells and all the cells apply the same rule .",
    "we denote the application of the update rule on the entire lattice by @xmath7 .    in early work",
    "@xcite , wolfram proposed that ca can be grouped into four classes of complexity .",
    "class 1 consists of ca whose dynamics reaches a steady state regardless of the initial conditions .",
    "class 2 consists of ca whose long time evolution produces periodic or nested structures .",
    "ca from both of these classes are simple in the sense that their long time evolution can be deduced from running the system a small number of time steps . on the other hand , class 3 and class 4 consist of complex \" ca .",
    "class 3 ca produce structures that seem random . class 4 ca produce localized structures that propagate and interact in a complex way above a regular background .",
    "this classification is heuristic and the assignment of ca to the four classes is somewhat subjective .",
    "successive works on ca attempted to improve it or to find better alternatives@xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is , to date , no universally agreed upon classification scheme of ca .    based on numerical experiments ,",
    "wolfram hypothesized that most of class 3 and 4 ca are _ computationally irreducible_@xcite .",
    "namely , the evolution of these ca can not be predicted by a process which is drastically more efficient than themselves . in order to calculate the state of a computationally irreducible ca after @xmath8 time steps , one must run the ca for @xmath8 time steps or perform a computation of equivalent complexity .",
    "this definition is somewhat loose because it is not always clear how to compare computation running times and efficiency on different architectures .",
    "in addition , wolfram recognized that even computationally irreducible systems may have some superficial reducibility `` ( see page 746 in ref .  ) and can be reduced to a limited extent .",
    "the difference between superficial '' and true reducibility however is not well defined .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the asymptotic @xmath9 behavior of a computationally irreducible system can not be predicted by any computation of finite size .",
    "wolfram further argued that computationally irreducible systems are abundant in nature and that this fact explains our inability as physicists to deal with complex systems @xcite .",
    "it is difficult in general to tell whether a ca , behaving in an apparently complex way , is computationally irreducible .",
    "more concrete properties of ca which are related to computational irreducibility are _ undecidability _ and _ universality_. mathematical processes are said to be undecidable when there can be no algorithm that is guaranteed to predict their outcome in a finite time .",
    "equivalently , ca are said to be undecidable when aspects of their dynamics are undecidable .",
    "computationally irreducible ca are therefore undecidable and in the weak asymptotic definition that we gave above , computational irreducibility is equivalent to undecidability . for lack of a better choice",
    "we adopt this asymptotic definition and in the reminder of this work we will use the two terms interchangeably .    some ca are known to be universal turing machines@xcite and are capable of performing all computations done by other processes .",
    "a famous two dimensional example is conway s game of life@xcite ; several examples in one dimension are lindgren and nordahl @xcite , albert and culik @xcite and wolfram s rule 110 @xcite .",
    "universal ca are , in a sense , maximally complex because they can emulate the dynamics of all other ca .",
    "being universal turing machines , these ca are subject to undecidable questions regarding their dynamics@xcite .",
    "for example whether an initial state will ever decay into a quiescent state is the ca equivalence of the undecidable halting problem@xcite .",
    "universal ca are therefore undecidable .",
    "wolfram s classification of ca is topological in the sense that ca are classified according to the properties of their trajectories . a different , more ambitious",
    ", approach is to classify ca according to a parameter derived directly from their rule tables .",
    "langton @xcite suggested that ca rules can be parameterized by his @xmath10 parameter which measures the fraction of non - quiescence rule table entries .",
    "he showed a strong correlation between the value of @xmath10 and the complexity found in the ca trajectories . for small values of @xmath10 one",
    "characteristically finds class 1 and 2 behavior while for @xmath11 a class 3 behavior is usually observed .",
    "langton identified a narrow region of intermediate values of @xmath10 where he found class 4 characteristic behavior .",
    "based on these observations langton proposed the _ edge of chaos _ hypothesis@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis claims that in the space of dynamical systems , interesting systems which are capable of computation are located at the boundary between simple and chaotic systems .",
    "this appealing hypothesis however was criticized in later works @xcite .",
    "recently , a different parametrization of ca rule tables was proposed by dubacq et al .",
    "this new approach is based on the information content of the rule table as measured by its kolmogorov complexity .",
    "as we will show below , our results lend support to this notion and indicate that rule tables with low kolmogorov complexity lead to simple behavior and vice versa .",
    "in addition to attempts to find order and hierarchy in the space of ca rules , much research has been devoted to the study of ca classes with special properties .",
    "additive ca ( or linear ) @xcite , commuting ca @xcite and ca with certain algebraic properties @xcite are a few examples .",
    "unsurprisingly , the dynamics of ca which enjoy such special properties can in most cases be understood and predictable at some level .    in this work",
    "we will mostly be concerned with the family of one dimensional , nearest neighbor binary ca that were the subject of wolfram s investigations .",
    "these 256 elementary rules are among the simplest imaginable ca and thus present us with the least computational challenges when attempting to coarse - grain them .",
    "we will use wolfram s notation@xcite for identifying individual rules .",
    "the update function of an elementary rule is described by a rule number between 0 and 255 . the eight bit binary representation of the rule number specifies the update function outcome for the eight possible three cell configurations ( where 000 `` is the least significant and 111 '' is the most significant bit ) .",
    "ca are often conveniently visualized with different colors denoting different cell values .",
    "when dealing with binary ca we will use the convention @xmath12 , @xmath13 and use the two notations interchangeably .",
    "we now turn to study the emergence of large scale patterns in ca and the associated predictability problems by attempting to coarse - grain ca .",
    "there are many ways to define a coarse - graining of a dynamical system . in this work",
    "we define it as a ( real - space ) renormalization scheme where the original ca @xmath0 is coarse - grained to a renormlized ca @xmath14 through the lattice transformation @xmath15 . the projection function @xmath16 projects the value of a block of @xmath17 cells in @xmath18 , which we term a _ supercell _ , to a single cell in @xmath19 . by writing @xmath20",
    "we denote the block - wise application of @xmath21 on the entire lattice @xmath22 .",
    "only non - trivial cases where @xmath21 is irreversible are considered because we want @xmath19 to provide a partial account of the full dynamics of @xmath18 .    in order for @xmath19 and @xmath21 to provide a coarse - grained emulation of @xmath18",
    "they must satisfy the commutativity condition @xmath23 for every initial condition @xmath24 of @xmath18 .",
    "the constant @xmath25 in the above equation is a time scale associated with the coarse - graining . a repeated application of eq.([coarse - graining_def ] )",
    "shows that @xmath26 for all @xmath8 .",
    "namely , running the original ca for @xmath27 time steps and then projecting is equivalent to projecting the initial condition and then running the renormalized ca for @xmath8 time steps .",
    "thus , if we are only interested in the projected information we can run the more efficient ca @xmath19 .",
    "renormalization group transformations in statistical physics are usually performed with projection operators that arise from a physical intuition and understanding of the system in question .",
    "majority rules and different types of averages are often the projection operators of choice . in this work",
    "we have the advantage that the ca we wish to coarse - grain are fully discrete systems and the number of possible projections of a supercell of size @xmath17 is finite .",
    "we will therefore consider all possible ( at least with small supercells ) projection operators and will not restrict ourselves to coarse - graining by averaging .",
    "in addition , the discrete nature of ca makes it very difficult to find useful approximate solutions of eq.([coarse - graining_def ] ) because there is no natural small parameter that can be used to construct perturbative coarse - graining schemes .",
    "we therefore require that eq .",
    "( [ coarse - graining_def ] ) is satisfied exactly .",
    "we now define a simple procedure for coarse - graining ca .",
    "other constructions are undoubtedly possible .",
    "for simplicity we limit our treatment to one - dimensional systems with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensions and different interaction radii are straightforward .",
    "the commutativity condition eq .  ( [ coarse - graining_def ] ) implies that the renormlized ca @xmath19 is homomorphic to the dynamics of @xmath18 on the scale defined by the supercell size @xmath17 . to search for explicit coarse - graining rules",
    ", we define the @xmath17th supercell version @xmath28 of @xmath18 .",
    "each cell of @xmath29 represents @xmath17 cells of @xmath18 and accepts values from the alphabet @xmath30 which includes all possible configurations of @xmath17 cells in @xmath18 .",
    "the transition function @xmath31 of the supercell ca can be defined in many ways depending on our choice of the supercells interaction radius .",
    "here we choose @xmath29 to be a nearest neighbor ca and compute @xmath32 by running @xmath18 for @xmath17 time steps on all possible initial conditions of length @xmath33 . in this way",
    "@xmath29 follows the dynamics of @xmath18 and each application of @xmath29 computes the evolution of a block of @xmath17 cells of @xmath18 , for @xmath17 time steps",
    ". this choice will later result in a coarse - grained ca @xmath19 which is itself nearest - neighbor .",
    "this is convenient because it enables us to compare the original and coarse - grained systems .",
    "another convenient feature of this construction is that it renders the coarse - graining time scale @xmath25 equal to the supercell size @xmath17 .",

    "can all ca be coarse - grained ? if not , which ca can be coarse - grained and which can not ? what types of coarse - graining transitions can we hope to find ?    to answer these questions we tried systematically to coarse - grain one dimensional ca .",

    "for each value of @xmath152 and @xmath179 we generated 100 rules and counted the number of rules exhibiting complex behavior .",
    "a rule was labelled complex \" if it showed class 3 or 4 behavior and exhibited a complex sensitivity to perturbations in the initial conditions .",

    "we first note that our statistics support dubacq et al .",
    "@xcite , who proposed that rule tables with low kolmogorov complexities lead to simple behavior and rule tables with large kolmogorov complexity lead to complex behavior .",
    "moreover , our results show that the fraction of complex rules does not depend on the alphabet size and is only a function of @xmath179 .",
    "rules with larger alphabets show complex behavior at a lower value of @xmath187 . as a consequence",
    ", a large fraction of projectable rules are complex and this fraction grows with the alphabet size @xmath152 .    as we explained earlier , the kolmogorov complexity of supercell versions of ca approaches zero as the supercell size @xmath17",
    "is increased .",
    "our experiments therefore indicate that a measure one of all ca are coarse - grained - able if we use a coarse enough scale .",
    "moreover , the data collapse that we obtain and the sharp transition of the scaling function suggest that it may be possible to know in advance at what length scales to look for valid projections",
    ". this can be very useful when attempting to coarse - grain ca or other dynamical systems because it can narrow down the search domain .",
    "as in the case of garden of eden \" states that we studied earlier , we interpret the transition point as an emergent scale which above it we are likely to find self organized patterns .",
    "note however that this scale is a little shifted in fig .",
    "[ projection_probability ] ( b ) when compared with fig .",
    "[ projection_probability ] ( a ) .",
    "the emergence scale is thus sensitive to the types of large scale patterns we are looking for .",
    "in this work we studied emergent phenomena in complex systems and the associated predictability problems by attempting to coarse - grain ca .",
    "we found that many elementary ca can be coarse - grained in space and time and that in some cases complex , undecidable ca can be coarse - grained to decidable and predictable ca .",
    "we conclude from this fact that undecidability and computational irreducibility are not good measures for physical complexity . physical complexity , as opposed to computational complexity should address the interesting , physically relevant , coarse - grained degrees of freedom .",
    "these coarse - grained degrees of freedom maybe simple and predictable even when the microscopic behavior is very complex .",
    "the above definition of physical complexity brings about the question of the objectivity of macroscopic descriptions @xcite .",
    "is our choice of a coarse - grained description ( and its consequent complexity ) subjective or is it dictated by the system ?",
    "our results are in accordance with shalizi and moore @xcite : it is both . in many cases we discovered that a particular ca can undergo different coarse - graining transitions using different projection operators . in these cases",
    "the system dictates a set of valid projection operators and we are restricted to choose our coarse - grained description from this set .",
    "we do however have some freedom to manifest our subjective interest .",
    "the coarse - graining transitions that we found induce a hierarchy on the family of elementary ca ( see fig .",
    "[ mapfigure ] ) .",
    "moreover , it seems that rule complexity never increases with coarse - graining transitions .",
    "the coarse - graining hierarchy therefore provides a partial complexity order of ca where complex rules are found at the top of the hierarchy and simple rules are at the bottom .",
    "the order is partial because we can not relate rules which are not connected by coarse - graining transitions .",
    "this coarse - graining hierarchy can be used as a new classification scheme of ca . unlike wolfram s , classification",
    "this scheme is not a topological one since the basis of our suggested classification is not the ca trajectories . nor is this scheme parametric , such as langton s @xmath10 parameter scheme .",
    "our scheme reflects similarities in the algebraic properties of ca rules .",
    "it simply says that if some coarse - grained aspects of rule @xmath18 can be captured by the detailed dynamics of rule @xmath19 then rule @xmath18 is at least as complex as rule @xmath19 .",
    "rule @xmath18 maybe more complex because in some cases it can do more than its projection .",
    "note that our hierarchy may subdivide wolfram s classes .",
    "for example rule 128 is higher on the hierarchy than rule 0 .",
    "these two rules belong to class 1 but rule 128 can be coarse - grained to rule 0 and it is clear that an opposite transition can not exist",
    ". it will be interesting to find out if class 3 and 4 can also be subdivided .    in the last part of this work we tried to understand why is it possible to find so many coarse - graining transitions between ca .",
    "at first blush , it seems that coarse - graining transitions should be rare because finding valid projection operators is an over constrained problem .",
    "this was our initial intuition when we first attempted to coarse - grain ca .",
    "to our surprise we found that many ca can undergo coarse - graining transitions .",
    "a more careful investigation of the above question suggests that finding valid projection operators is possible because of the structure of the rules which govern the large scale dynamics .",
    "these large scale rules are update functions for supercells , whose tables can be computed directly from the single cell update function .",
    "they thus contain the same amount of information as the single cell rule .",
    "their size however grows with the supercell size and therefore they have vanishing kolmogorov complexities .",
    "in other words , the large scale update functions are highly structured objects .",
    "they contain many regularities which can be used for finding valid projection operators .",
    "we did not give a formal proof for this statement but provided a strong experimental evidence .",
    "in our experiments we discovered that the probability to find a valid projection is a universal function of the kolmogorov complexity of the supercell update rule .",
    "this universal probability function varies from zero at large kolmogorov complexity ( small supercells ) to one at small kolmogorov complexity ( large supercells ) .",
    "it is therefore very likely that we find many coarse - graining transitions when we go to large enough scales .",
    "our interpretation of the above results is that of emergence .",
    "when we go to large enough scales we are likely to find dynamically identifiable large scale patterns .",
    "these patterns are emergent ( or self organized ) because they do not explicitly exist in the original single cell rules .",
    "the large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the lack of information .",
    "namely , the system ( the update rule , not the cell lattice ) does not contain enough information to be complex at large scales .",
    "finding a projection operator is one specific type of an over constrained problem .",
    "motivated by our results we looked into other types of over constrained problems .",
    "the satisfyability@xcite problem ( k - sat ) is a generalized ( np complete ) form of constraint satisfaction system . we generated random 3-sat instances with different number of variables deep in the un - sat region of parameter space .",
    "the generated instances however were not completely random and were generated by generating functions .",
    "the generating functions controlled the instance s kolmogorov complexity , in the same way that we used in section [ proj_prob_with_bounded_k ] .",
    "we found@xcite that the probability for these instances to be satisfiable obeys the same universal probability function of eq .",
    "( [ rproj_fit ] )",
    ". it will be interesting to understand the origin of this universality and its implications .    in this work ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to deal with ca because it is relatively easy to look for valid projection operators for them . a greater ( and more practical ) challenge will now be to try and coarse - grain more sophisticated dynamical systems such as probabilistic ca , coupled maps and partial differential equations .",
    "these types of systems are among the main work horses of scientific modelling , and being able to coarse - grain them will be very useful , and is a topic of current research , e.g. in material science@xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see if one can derive an emergence length scale for those systems like the one we found for garden of eden \" sequences in ca ( section [ gardensofeden ] ) .",
