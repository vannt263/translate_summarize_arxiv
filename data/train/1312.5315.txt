    "was detected in the 100 and 160 @xmath3 m pacs images , but not at 70 @xmath3 m or in the spire images .",
    "the pacs images are shown in figure [ fig : ims ] , with emission clearly detected at 160 @xmath3 m , marginally detected at 100 @xmath3 m , and not detected at 70 @xmath3 m .",
    "the detection positions are consistent with the expected star position given the 2 arcsec at 1@xmath5 pointing uncertainty of _ herschel_. fitting the emission with observations of the calibration target @xmath6 dra as a model point spread function ( psf ) shows that the emission is consistent with that from a point source .",
    "some structure is seen to the nw at 100 @xmath3 m , though after psf subtraction this emission is only 1 - 2@xmath5 significant .",

    "we have `` modified '' the blackbody disc spectrum , multiplying by @xmath14 beyond @xmath15 m , to account for inefficient long - wavelength emission by small grains and ensure a more realistic prediction of the sub - mm disc brightness .",
    "this modification is not required by the spire limits however , and the true spectrum beyond 160 @xmath3 m is uncertain .",
    "this model has a fractional luminosity @xmath16 , relatively bright for a debris disc , and very similar to the brightness of the disc around fomalhaut itself ( @xmath17 ) . for our stellar luminosity , assuming grains that absorb and emit as blackbodies , this temperature corresponds to dust at a radial distance of about 10 au .",
    "though uncertain , the disc diameter implied by blackbody grains is therefore 20 au .",
    "the disc is probably larger than this estimate however ; low - mass stars such as lp  876 - 10 and gj  581 are unable to remove small grains with radiation pressure , and due to inefficient long - wavelength emission small grains are hotter than blackbodies .",
    "the ratio of actual to blackbody size , @xmath18 , has been derived for many discs , and varies from near unity for early a - type stars , to values of 3 - 4 for sun - like stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "because they lie in the white region , discs with these temperatures and fractional luminosities would have been easily detected around tw  psa.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      tw psa was observed in december 2010 .",
    "the images have relatively low s / n , but appear consistent with unresolved emission .",
    "we obtained fluxes of @xmath21 mjy and @xmath22 mjy at 100 and 160 @xmath3 m respectively .",
    "the best fitting photospheric model has @xmath23k and @xmath24 , with photospheric fluxes of 12.8 and 4.9 mjy at 100 and 160 @xmath3 m respectively . the observed fluxes are not significantly different from the photospheric values , so no excess is detected and we did not observe this target again .",
    "figure [ fig : lim ] shows the limits on the fractional luminosity of a disc around tw  psa given these observations , combined with limits also set at 24 and 70 @xmath3 m by the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "discs as bright as those around fomalhaut and lp  876 - 10 would easily have been detected around tw  psa , and any disc around tw  psa that has a similar temperature must be more than an order of magnitude fainter than those discs .",
    "it is possible that the observed _ herschel _ excess emission arises from chance alignment of lp  876 - 10 with a background galaxy .",
    "the chance of a 15.5 mjy or brighter background source appearing within 50 ( the _ herschel _ pointing accuracy is about 20 at 1@xmath5 ) at 160 @xmath3 m is about 1% @xcite .",
    "this estimate is conservative ; a background galaxy randomly placed within a 5 arcsec radius of some position is more likely to be at the outer edge of this circle , and the emission was twice observed to be within 2 arcsec of the expected position .",
    "given the 89 m dwarfs observed by debris , one would expect @xmath21 case of background galaxy alignment among these stars .",
    "however , that lp  876 - 10 is among the m dwarfs observed by debris is a red - herring for the confusion estimate ; this discovery could have been made by anyone with an interest in lp  876 - 10 and access to the _ herschel _ archive , in which case the debris sample would not have been considered for the confusion analysis .",
    "of course , lp  876 - 10 is also among the sample of all stars that were observed by _",
    "( i.e. background confusion is independent of stellar properties and observing programmes ) .",
    "this study was motivated by the recent discovery by @xcite that lp  876 - 10 has a kinematic association with fomalhaut , a property that , aside from the age of the fomalhaut system , is independent of the presence of a debris disc .",
    "therefore , we estimate a @xmath21% chance of confusion of lp  876 - 10 .",
    "another consideration is of system plausibility , in essence consideration of priors that influence the likelihood of the lp  876 - 10 excess being due to a debris disc .",
    "the main property of interest is stellar age ; if lp  876 - 10 were a field m dwarf with a random age between 0 - 10 gyr , the chance of a disc detection would be low , but given the prevalence of debris around young stars , the association of this star with 440 myr - old fomalhaut makes the chance of disc detection more likely and less surprising .",
    "considering binarity , the eccentricity of the debris ring and planet around fomalhaut itself are both suggestive of possible interactions with another star , for which lp  876 - 10 is a probable candidate .",
    "such an interaction would also stir up material around lp  876 - 10 , again making the detection of a disc more likely .",
    "therefore , while follow - up observations are warranted , we conclude based on the above discussion that the lp  876 - 10 excess is most likely associated with the star itself , and interpret this emission as arising from dust in a debris disc .",
    "the discovery of a debris disc around lp  876 - 10 is remarkable for several reasons ; i ) debris discs are rarely detected around late - type stars , ii ) the fomalhaut system is only the second case where two debris discs have been found in a stellar system , and iii ) the primary is host to both a bright debris disc and an exoplanet whose eccentricities may be related to interaction(s ) with one or both of the wide companions .",
    "we now briefly explore each of these aspects .    currently , the lowest mass nearby star thought to host a debris disc is the m4v star at  mic , a member of the @xmath25 pictoris moving group @xcite .",
    "excesses have also been detected for low - mass stars in young clusters ( e.g. m5v id10 in the 154 pc distant , 50 myr old ic 2391 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though these systems are less well characterised due to their greater distance .",
    "we attempted to verify the at  mic 24 @xmath3 m excess reported by @xcite , but found a greater photospheric 24 @xmath3 m flux ( 144 vs. 114 mjy ) .",
    "this higher flux agrees with the observed value ( when colour corrected for the stellar spectrum ) of 143 mjy , and thus we find no ir excess for at  mic .",
    "the most likely reason for the difference is that we used the more recent ames - cond phoenix models @xcite , though we also included more mid - ir photometry ( from wise and akari ) in fitting our atmosphere model . given difficulties with modelling m dwarf photospheres , and a lack of excess detection by @xcite and riviere - marichalar et al .",
    "( a&a submitted ) , we do not consider the excess for this star to be robust .",
    "thus , lp  876 - 10 , also with a spectral type of m4v , is one of the lowest mass stars thought to host a debris disc , and as a bright nearby star will be an important object for future m dwarf debris disc work .",
    "while debris discs are rarely detected around late - type stars , the most probable reason is that due to the low luminosity of their host stars , their discs are cool and faint and only emit significantly at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "sensitivity at these wavelengths is poor relative to the photospheric level , so only the brightest discs can be detected ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the lp  876 - 10 disc does not emit strongly at 70 @xmath3 m , so would probably not have been detected even if it had been observed at this wavelength by _",
    "spitzer_. with @xmath2100 late - type stars observed by _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ , the disc around lp  876 - 10 therefore lies among the brightest few percent of m dwarf debris discs .",
    "the fractional luminosity of @xmath26 is not extreme enough to exclude the standard picture of a debris disc born at the same time as the star however . at the system age of 440 myr @xcite",
    "collisional grinding is expected to have reduced the disc mass and luminosity , with fractional luminosities above roughly @xmath27 to @xmath28 excluded by collisional mass loss for this disc radius and age @xcite .",
    "thus , while the disc may have originated in a protoplanetary disc that was more massive than average , a scenario where the disc was created more recently is not required ( but as noted below is of course possible ) .    of the three stars in the fomalhaut system ,",
    "both the primary and tertiary are now known to have debris discs .",
    "debris discs around multiple components of multiple stellar systems are rare , with the only other example being the hd 223352 system , with a circumbinary disc around an a0v + k - type close binary , and a second disc around the third object , the k1v star hd 223340 @xcite . at 75 arcsec from the primary and with a system distance of 42 pc , hd 223340",
    "is at least 3000 au from the primary .",
    "the fomalhaut system is even more loosely bound , with lp  876 - 10 at 0.77 pc from the primary ( 158 kau , * ? ? ?",
    "this rarity is perhaps surprising given that multiple stellar systems with multiple protoplanetary discs are relatively common ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though may in part be due to the later companion spectral types .",
    "the detection of two discs in these systems might be attributed to their young ages ; debris discs are observed to become fainter over time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a result of collisional evolution ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so their discovery is more likely if the host stars are young .",
    "hd 223352/40 belongs to the @xmath270 myr old ab doradus moving group @xcite so the detection of two discs is perhaps not surprising .",
    "the fomalhaut system is about 440 myr old , which is young relative to randomly selected m - type stars , whose ages will be evenly distributed up to @xmath210 gyr . therefore lp",
    "876 - 10 is among the youngest @xmath25% of m dwarfs , which may explain the presence of a bright debris disc despite detections generally being rare .",
    "many young stars are not seen to have debris however , so the lack of a bright disc around tw  psa may simply mean that the disc around this star had a smaller radius and has evolved to obscurity by more rapid collisional evolution , or that it was initially lower in mass than the other two .",
    "considering how the lp  876 - 10 debris disc fits within the greater context of the fomalhaut system , the properties of note are the large separations of tw  psa and lp  876 - 10 , the spectacular offset debris ring @xcite , and the high eccentricity planet , fomalhaut b @xcite . that lp  876 - 10 lies along the same position angle as the fomalhaut disc major axis , which is only @xmath29 from edge - on , may be a hint that both currently orbit in the same plane @xcite , though the lp  876 - 10 plane will vary over time due to galactic tides ( see below ) .",
    "a key question is whether the companions ever come very close to the primary ( i.e. have small pericenter distances ) or each other , which could influence the observed properties of the debris discs .",
    "there seem to be two formation scenarios for this wide multiple system , each with differences in the expected companion orbital evolution ; relatively gentle multiple system formation during cluster evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dynamical interactions in a triple system where hardening of an inner binary results in a wider companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the fomalhaut system was originally more compact overall and lp  876 - 10 dynamically thrown to a much larger orbit , it would have a highly eccentric orbit and the two debris discs could be related .",
    "however , this formation scenario relies on the hardening of an inner binary , and tw  psa is itself probably too well separated from fomalhaut to be the cause @xcite .",
    "it is also very unlikely that fomalhaut is itself a close binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so the inner binary hardening scenario seems unlikely here .",
    "if the fomalhaut system formed essentially by chance when momentarily bound stars in a cluster became a permanent system , then their inclinations should be random , and their eccentricities are expected to be weighted towards higher values ( a median @xmath30 of about 0.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore unlikely , though possible , that either tw  psa or lp  876 - 10 would initially have an eccentricity sufficient to come very close to fomalhaut ( within 500 au , or @xmath31 , say ) .",
    "this eccentricity may evolve however , due to interactions between the companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or the effect of galactic tides ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the timescale for the eccentricity of tw  psa to vary due to kozai cycles depends on the companions orbits , which are unknown , but for circular orbits at their known separation is @xmath22.7 gyr , meaning that this mechanism may not have had time to cause this companion to interact strongly with the primary unless the initial eccentricity was already very high .",
    "such a scenario also provides no link between the fomalhaut and lp  876 - 10 discs .",
    "galactic tides however , become stronger for wider orbits , and the timescale estimate given by @xcite suggests that the companion orbits will vary on timescales similar to the orbital periods ( @xmath210 - 100 myr ) . with the caveat that the system must also remain stable for the system age of @xmath2440 myr , the effects of galactic tides may dominate the dynamics of the companions , and thus may also have lead to sufficiently close encounters of either companion with the primary ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "whether there is any link between the discs around fomalhaut and lp  876 - 10 is unclear .",
    "if the stars have always remained well separated , the evolution of the two bright debris discs should be no different to random single stars , and their detection in the fomalhaut system would be attributed to the relative youth of the system ( in particular lp  876 - 10 ) .",
    "alternatively , the wide separation of the companions may lead to complex dynamics ; the bright debris discs and eccentric planet may have a common cause due to a past interaction between fomalhaut and lp  876 - 10 , which stirred up their debris discs , perhaps igniting a collisional cascade in a previously quiescent disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or provoking an instability in the planetary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that later stirs the disc .",
    "such scenarios are of course speculation , but motivate detailed observations of all system components",
    ". it may be that high resolution observations of the lp  876 - 10 disc will reveal evidence of dynamical perturbations , a signature of yet another planet ( e.g. fomalhaut cb ) or a highly eccentric stellar orbit that periodically brings it closer to fomalhaut or tw  psa .",
