    "an additional uncertainty comes from the modeled magnetic field strength , which is somewhat weaker than the peas magnetic fields .",
    "although the presence of shocks shifts the peas toward lower optical depths , the galaxies line ratios still appear offset to higher [ o]/h@xmath11  ratios and/or lower [ o]/[o ]  ratios by factors of @xmath551.5 - 2 relative to the @xmath56 @xmath31 model grids ( see e.g. , figure  [ fig_shock50 ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this offset is that higher density models are more appropriate for the extreme peas .",

    "the existence of lower ionization nebulae within the peas may also resolve the discrepancy .",
    "if low ionization nebulae contribute a fraction of the observed [ o ]  emission , they could account for the higher [ o]/h@xmath11  and lower [ o]/[o ]  ratios relative to the grids . adopting lower reddening corrections or higher metallicities for the peas could also lessen the offset ; however , the uncertainties in these quantities are too low to completely explain the disagreement . finally , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : nebular ] , a population of hot , low - metallicity stars could provide an additional means of increasing the [ o]/[o ]  ratio .",
    "given the current lack of evidence for such stars , however , we conclude that the presence of multiple nebulae and higher densities in the star - forming regions are the more likely explanations .    despite these uncertainties , the cloudy models show that including shock emission lowers the inferred optical depths of the peas , in some cases dramatically",
    ". if the shocks are due to sn activity , the peas must be old enough for such events to take place . as a test , we consider pea j101157 , the highest ew pea and potentially the youngest .",

    "while the former value could be reached in less than 4 myr following an instantaneous burst , the latter value requires more than 6 myr .",
    "however , if the snrs are extremely bright ( 10@xmath62 ) , as might be expected for a young burst , than the required number of sne drops to only 560 - 4500 , 0.4 - 5% of pea j101157 s o stars .",

    "it has a metallicity of 0.2and an h@xmath11  ew of 272  @xcite , suggesting a similar age to the peas .",
    "in addition , ii zw 40 has detectable wr features , including the blue bump and si  @xmath14565 , but the blue bump is dominated by the much stronger nebular emission of he , [ fe ] , and [ ar ]  @xcite .",
    "the much weaker strength of the wr features compared to the nebular emission shows that these features could easily be below our detection limits .",
    "based on the similarities between he - emitting galaxies with and without wr features , @xcite suggest that shocks generate some of the nebular he  emission , even in wr galaxies .",
    "the presence of weak [ fe ]  @xmath14227 emission and high - velocity emission - line wings in ii zw 40 supports the shock hypothesis @xcite .",
    "although ii zw 40 is unlikely to be optically thin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it shows that shock ionization of he  is feasible at the peas metallicities and ages .",
    "thus , even if wr stars are present in the green peas , shock heating may still be the primary origin of the high ionization nebular lines .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that shock - heating from the earliest sne could account for the observed he  emission . in addition , shocks due to a galaxy merger or gas infall could occur even earlier , and younger ages for the peas could be possible .",
    "if shocks are present , the peas high [ o]/[o ]  ratios may indicate a low optical depth .",
    "the source of the high ionization emission in the extreme green peas could be wn9 stars , early - type wr stars , chemically homogeneous o stars , shocks , or some combination of these sources .",
    "each of these sources has different implications for the escape of ionizing radiation , which we now discuss .",
    "if the he  emission is a stellar feature or due to stellar photoionization , the peas optical depth is ambiguous .",
    "low density models , with @xmath63 @xmath31 indicate a high optical depth . at higher densities ,",
    "consistent with the peas [ s ]  ratios , whether or not the peas are optically thin depends on the inner nebular radius and the filling factor .",
    "for instance , decreasing the filling factor of the dense gas decreases the inferred optical depth ( see figures  [ fig_sb99n2 ] and [ fig_sb99ff ] ) .",
    "increasing the inner radius lowers the ionization parameter ; the high [ o]/[o ]  ratios we observe would then have to be due to a low optical depth .",
    "unlike the cloudy models , the emission from the peas is not likely to originate from a single h  region . however ,",
    "if the emission is dominated by one cluster or several similar clusters , we can estimate which cloudy model geometries may be most reasonable .",
    "the stellar winds of wr stars may blow cavities of 50 pc  or more in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sn explosions will expand the superbubble cavity further .",
    "the broad wings in the peas h@xmath10 emission may already indicate that stellar feedback is evacuating gas around the star clusters and driving galactic winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulate a superbubble around a 10@xmath64  cluster at 0.25 , expanding into an ambient medium with density @xmath65 @xmath31 .",
    "the superbubble cavity reaches a radius of 50 pc  within 3.5 myr and expands to 70 pc  within 4.5 myr .",
    "the radius scales with cluster mass as @xmath66 @xcite , so for our 10@xmath67  starburst99 simulation , the cavity radii should be 79 and 111 pc , respectively .",
    "if we increase the density by a factor of 10 , as appropriate for pea j121903 , the radii remain 50 - 70 pc .",
    "therefore , for our @xmath37  starburst cloudy models , the models with inner radii greater than 50 pc may have the most realistic geometries .",
    "models with these inner radii and @xmath68 @xmath31 generally indicate a low optical depth ( see figure  [ fig_sb99n3ff ] ) .",
    "the exact optical depth of the peas also depends on their age and the resulting ionizing spectrum .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig_sb99n2 ] shows that for a given inner radius , a 5 myr - old model gives a slightly lower optical depth than a 4 myr - old model .",
    "the ionizing spectrum of chemically homogeneous o stars is highly uncertain , and the existence of 60,000 k homogeneous stars has not been observationally confirmed .",
    "we can not determine the optical depth of the peas if their ionization is due to a chemically homogeneous population .",
    "thus , while we can not assess the precise optical depth of the extreme peas , a low optical depth remains plausible , particularly for the peas with the highest densities .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : shocks ] , including a shock contribution to the peas line fluxes decreases estimates of their optical depth .",
    "this same situation is apparent in the spectra of dem l301 , an lmc superbubble .",
    "@xcite show that a combination of shock - heating and density - bounding explain dem l301 s emission , although at first glance , the line ratios appear to indicate radiation - bounding .",
    "@xcite confirm that dem l301 is indeed optically thin .",
    "not only do sne affect the nebular emission , but they may actually promote a low optical depth .",
    "as sn - driven bubbles expand in the ism and eventually blow out of the galaxy , they create low - density passages that aid photon escape @xcite . like lyman - break galaxies ,",
    "the peas have large sfrs and spatially distributed star formation , which enhance the ism porosity @xcite .",
    "in addition , with their young ages , the peas may be at the optimal time for the escape of lyman - continuum radiation ; they are old enough for sne and stellar winds to begin to reshape the ism , but young enough to possess large numbers of uv - luminous massive o or wr stars .",
    "the cloudy models for the wr and shock - heating scenarios at @xmath69 @xmath31 are generally optically thick or borderline optically thin .",
    "models at higher densities favor lower optical depths but could still be consistent with optically thin nebulae if the inner radii are sufficiently small and shocks are negligible .",
    "nevertheless , at all densities , the peas may be more optically thin than the models suggest .",
    "for instance , optically thick clumps tend to dilute the signature of density - bounding ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cloudy models further assume that the emission originates from a single nebular region or identical nebulae .",
    "in reality , the emission is the sum of the emission from multiple nebulae , which may have different levels of ionization .",
    "low - ionization emission from other nebulae or a companion galaxy could lower the observed [ o]/[o ]  ratios and cause the gas to appear more optically thick than it actually is .",
    "the extreme peas may therefore have high escape fractions for ionizing radiation .",
    "however , further observations are needed to diagnose their optical depths and distinguish among the potential ionizing sources .",
    "we are obtaining deeper spectra of the extreme peas to confirm or refute the existence of shocks and to constrain the wr population .",
    "observations of massive stars in low - metallicity galaxies are also critical to understand homogeneous stellar evolution and the stellar spectra of low - metallicity o and wr stars .",
    "the green peas are a rare class of compact , emission - line galaxies at @xmath0 with unusually powerful [ o ]  emission and the potential for a high escape fraction . through their high ionization emission , extreme star - formation intensities , and clumpy morphologies ,",
    "the green peas provide a glimpse of massive star feedback and ionizing photon propagation in high redshift galaxies . while the large [ o]/[o ]  ratios of the peas may indicate a low optical depth , high ionization lines such as he  and [ ar ]  in the sdss spectra show evidence for strong , high - energy emission . using stellar population and nebular photoionization models ,",
    "we have investigated the ionizing sources and optical depths for six of the highest ionization peas .",
    "the six extreme peas are young and powerful starbursts , with high electron temperatures of @xmath70 k and densities of 100 - 1000 @xmath31 .",
    "their high balmer - line ews indicate young ages of 3.7 - 5.1 myr , according to starburst99 instantaneous burst models .",
    "we detect the he  @xmath13819 line in emission in several objects and in stacked spectra , which corroborates the young ages .",
    "the @xmath13819 line sets an upper limit of 3 myr on the ages for an instantaneous burst and 10 myr for continuous star formation @xcite .",
    "the peas young ages and the presence of he  @xmath14686 emission set strong constraints on the possible ionizing sources in the peas .",
    "no wr features are visible in stacked spectra of the peas . however , we tentatively detect wr features in peas j101157 , j145735 , and j030321 .",
    "the narrow fwhms ( 3 - 5  ) of the he  emission suggest a nebular origin or a narrow wnl stellar feature .    using the wnl line luminosities of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we calculate the number of wnl stars necessary to produce the observed @xmath14686 emission as a stellar feature . the high resulting wr / o ratios and the @xmath71 si  @xmath14565 detection limits rule out the required wnl population for the @xmath72  case , but a wnl population with @xmath73  is possible .",
    "however , a higher - metallicity wnl population may not be consistent with the peas low measured metallicities .",
    "alternatively , the observed he  may result from photoionization by hot stars .",
    "cloudy photoionization models @xcite of single - star h  regions demonstrate that ordinary o stars are not hot enough to provide the necessary he@xmath74-ionizing flux .",
    "cloudy models using early - type wr stars , with core temperatures above 70,000 k , fit most of the observed line ratios . from the ionizing photon rates of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the number of wne and wce stars needed to produce the observed he .",
    "the resulting wr / o ratios are consistent with starburst99 instantaneous burst models , but the lack of broad he  emission in most objects eliminates the wce stars as the dominant cause of the emission . starburst99 and cloudy models likewise show that only 4 - 5 myr starbursts , which contain a substantial wr population , can simultaneously match the peas [ o]/[o ]  and he  emission .",
    "putative chemically homogeneous o stars could explain he  emission in galaxies without wr features @xcite .",
    "these stars may form at low metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can theoretically reach effective temperatures much higher than ordinary o stars @xcite .",
    "cloudy single - star h  region models with the 60,000 k stellar model of @xcite demonstrate that such hot o stars could account for the observed he . in addition , the presence of extremely hot o stars may be necessary to match the observed [ o]/h@xmath11 and [ o]/[o ]  ratios of the peas .",
    "more research is needed to determine whether homogeneous o stars exist , however , and how many ionizing photons they produce .",
    "we rule out an agn contribution to the he  emission at the 10% level , using the diagnostic diagram of @xcite .",
    "likewise , we find that hmxbs can not be the source of the he  ionization . using the models of @xcite , we calculate the expected number of luminous hmxbs in the peas . even assuming that each hmxb is a ulx , with the high nebular he",
    "@xmath14686 luminosity of holmberg ii x-1 @xcite , the resulting emission is an order of magnitude too low .",
    "fast , radiative shocks are an alternative mechanism for the production of he  @xcite , and the existence of fast shocks is supported by the high velocity balmer - line wings @xcite and [ o ]  and [ n ]  emission in the peas . to account for the contribution of shocks to the observed emission , we use the line emission predictions of the mappings iii shock models @xcite for different magnetic field strengths and velocities .",
    "assuming shocks generate all of the he  emission , we subtract the shock contribution from the observed line ratios . after correcting for shock emission ,",
    "the nebular line ratios indicate a lower optical depth , particularly for slower shocks . based on the h@xmath10  luminosities from the shock models ,",
    "the first sne , exploding 3.5 - 4 myr after an instantaneous burst , could produce the observed he  emission .",
    "younger ages could be possible if infalling gas or mergers are the cause of the shocks .",
    "although the precise origin of the he  emission is still uncertain , the cloudy models show that the peas may be optically thin .",
    "models with higher densities and larger inner radii imply lower optical depths .",
    "if the he  is due to wr stars , models with inner radii @xmath75 50 pc  and densities @xmath55 100 @xmath31 support both optically thick and optically thin scenarios , while models with the same inner radii and @xmath76 @xmath31 support a low optical depth .",
    "including the effects of shocks lowers the estimated optical depth further , and the presence of density inhomogeneities or emission from multiple nebulae may also lead us to overestimate the optical depth .",
    "the low levels of extinction , intense star formation , and young ages of the green peas make them ideal candidates for escaping ionizing radiation .",
    "the nebular emission of the peas with the highest [ o]/[o ]  ratios , their high densities , and the likely presence of shocks in these objects suggest that they may be leaking ionizing photons into the igm , and their ages may optimize photon escape . in these 3 - 4 myr starbursts ,",
    "stellar feedback is likely beginning to carve out passages in the ism for the escape of ionizing photons , while large numbers of massive stars are still available to produce lyman - continuum photons .",
    "however , the data are still inconclusive , and future observations are necessary to establish the escape fraction of the green peas .",
    "these galaxies offer a rare opportunity to study high - redshift star formation conditions , the effects of stellar feedback on the ism , and the propagation of ionizing photons from star clusters to the igm ."
