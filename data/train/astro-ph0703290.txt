    "recent infrared observations of the galactic center and the centers of other nearby galaxies have revealed a population of compact and massive star clusters located close to the centers of galaxies , such as the arches and quintuplet clusters @xcite , irs 13e @xcite , and irs 16sw @xcite and mgg-11 in m82 @xcite .",
    "the estimated masses of these clusters are in the range of @xmath5 to @xmath6 while their half - mass radii are between 0.1 and 1 pc , giving rise to central densities in excess of @xmath7 .",
    "dynamical simulations have also shown that if star clusters are born with sufficiently high central density , massive stars with @xmath8 will sink to the cluster center within a few myr , i.e. , before the end of the stable nuclear burning phase , through dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "their stellar radii are large enough that there is a high chance for collisions between them after the stars arrived in the center .",
    "indeed , @xmath9-body and monte carlo simulations have shown that collisions between high - mass stars in young star clusters can lead to the formation of a supermassive star with mass of several hundreds to several thousands @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such supermassive stars and the intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) which might form out of them could be the ultra - luminous x - ray sources recently discovered by _",
    "chandra _ and hst observations @xcite .",
    "it is also argued that runaway massive stars that are ejected from dense clusters become a candidate of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "however , whether supermassive stars can really form through runaway collisions and whether imbhs forms at the end of their lifetime is still not clear .",
    "so far , most simulations have neglected hydrodynamical processes during the collisions and the effects of stellar evolution .",
    "stars formed from the merging of other stars might start their lives with significant abundance gradients because of incomplete mixing .",
    "in addition , since merging events happen only after a star cluster has gone into core - collapse @xcite , runaway stars initially have higher he abundance as a result of the nuclear burning of the parent stars .",
    "evolution of stars formed through merging , thus , is likely to be different from the evolution of homogeneous stars with `` normal '' abundance .",
    "it has been argued that the formation of imbhs from metal - rich ( @xmath11 solar abundance ) massive stars is unlikely , because strong stellar winds @xcite considerably reduce the masses before the black holes form @xcite .",
    "however , because the lifetime of merged stars with higher he content is shorter than that of normal stars , the total mass lost during the lifetime might be smaller than these estimates .",
    "the present paper is a first attempt towards a realistic treatment of the stellar evolution of runaway stars . in the present paper",
    "we will follow the collision of two stars by means of sph calculations and then follow the evolution of the merger product with a stellar evolution code .",
    "the parameters of the colliding stars are taken from the results of @xmath9-body simulations of runaway merging of stars in young star clusters @xcite .",
    "our procedure consists of three steps : ( 1 ) stellar evolution of single stars , ( 2 ) simulations of stellar collisions and ( 3 ) stellar evolution of collision products .",
    "this procedure is essentially same as that used by @xcite . in their works",
    ", they concentrated on the formation of blue straggler stars due to the collision between low mass stars ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , in the present paper we are interested in the merging process and subsequent stellar evolution in the core of a very dense star cluster where only massive stars ( @xmath13 ) are involved in collisions because of mass segregation .",
    "@xcite showed that collisions in very dense clusters typically start at @xmath14myr after their formation . following this result",
    ", we consider various collisions ( table [ tab : sum ] ) of massive stars after @xmath15 myr from the formation .",
    "we determine the interior structure of the merged stars by calculating the stellar evolution of single stars with solar abundances from zero - age main sequence ( zams ) phase ( step ( 1 ) of the procedure ) .",
    "the stellar evolution is handled by one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherical symmetrical stellar evolution code .",
    "our code , which adopts a usual henyey method , is based on the program originally developed by @xcite .",
    "as adopted in general stellar evolution calculation , we neglect hydrodynamical evolution and only treat evolution on a kelvin - helmholtz ( thermal adjustment ) timescale , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath18 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are stellar ( solar ) mass , radius , and luminosity , respectively .",
    "our code adopts the opal opacity @xcite and equation of state @xcite tables , and the nuclear reaction rates tabulated in @xcite .",
    "we focus on the early phase of stellar evolution before the central h is exhausted . for this purpose",
    "it is reasonable to switch off nuclear burning of he and heavier elements , and to consider only h - burning because the central temperature is still not high ( @xmath23k in our simulations ) .    for step ( 2 ) , we construct spherical symmetric three dimensional ( 3d ) stellar structures from the 1d results",
    "then , we perform 3d smoothed - particle - hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations of stellar collisions with the parameters summarized in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "we use a modified version of the sph code by @xcite .",
    "an important modification is that we include a treatment of equation of state ( eos ) that takes into account radiation pressure in addition to a fully ionized ideal gas ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we adopt a balsara type artificial viscosity @xcite with viscosity parameters @xmath25 as suggested by @xcite . for the equal mass cases ( eq1 and eq2 in table [ tab : sum ] )",
    ", we use @xmath26 particles for each star ( mass resolution of @xmath27 @xmath1 ) . for the unequal mass cases ( ue1 and ue2 )",
    ", we use @xmath28 particles for star 1 and @xmath29 for star 2 , respectively ( mass resolution of @xmath30 @xmath1 ) . as will be discussed in appendix this relatively small",
    "@xmath9 is sufficient for our purpose and our results of sph simulations do not strongly depend on @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that initially each star is separated by impact parameter , @xmath31 , in all the cases , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the stellar radii before the collision .",
    "we put the first star at the origin and the other at the x - axis with a specific tangential velocity as shown in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "these velocities are typical for collisions that occur in central regions of dense clusters @xcite .",
    "larger initial velocities lead to less eccentric orbits and larger pericenter distances between the two stars and therefore longer merging times . during sph simulations",
    ", we always check whether merging occurs or not by assigning each particle into a membership either 1st star , 2nd star or unbound using enthalpy of each particle @xcite .",
    "we stop a sph run at least @xmath34 sec after the mering .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath35 is arbitrary and does not affect the results as long as it is sufficiently longer than the dynamical time scale .",
    "this criterion ensures that the particles are in dynamically stable states .",
    "the last snapshot is used to create the structure of a merged star that is evolved in step ( 3 ) . in step ( 3 ) , we follow the evolution of the collision products by the same 1d stellar evolution code used in step ( 1 ) . to do this",
    ", we need to construct 1d structure from the results of 3d sph simulations in step ( 2 ) . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the effect of rotation , and simply average radius , @xmath36 , density , @xmath37 , temperature , @xmath38 , and elemental abundances of the 3d results in mass radius coordinate , @xmath39 to give 1d spherical symmetric structure .",
    "needless to say , this treatment is a very simplified one .",
    "the sph simulations show that the end - products of the merging events are not spherical due to the rotation ( see figure [ fig : sph1 ] ) .",
    "for example , the ratio between the final rotational velocity and the circular velocity at a given radius ranges between 0.2 ( inner region ) and 0.8 ( outer region ) .",
    "indeed , for more detailed studies , we should adopt a more elaborated way that takes into account rotation when mapping a 3d distribution into a 1d spherical symmetric profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the rotational energy of the merged stars is less than 15 % of the gravitational energy , the rotation is not expected to affect the evolution of the stars much .",
    "thus , we think that we can give rough but reasonable estimates for the evolution of the collision products by our simple prescription . on the other hand ,",
    "the sph simulations can not treat low density envelopes on account of limited mass resolution .",
    "then , we extrapolate density and temperature structure to the outer region to match the inner structure obtained by the sph simulations . in order to do this , we adopt the eddington approximation to derive the relation between temperature and optical depth and assume hydrostatic equilibrium to set the density structure in the outer envelopes .",
    "also , in the sph simulation we do not consider nuclear energy release , because the total nuclear energy production integrated with collision duration is much smaller than the gravitational energy . in the later evolution of merged stars ( step 3 )",
    ", however , nuclear burning is as important as the energy release by gravitational contraction .",
    "then , we have to carefully determine luminosity , @xmath40 , from an energy equation , @xmath41 \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t } -\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t } \\right)_{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial t } , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is net energy gain by nuclear burning minus neutrino loss and @xmath43 is internal energy ( e.g. section 9 of kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) . note that the terms involving time derivative denote the energy release ( absorb ) by gravitation contraction ( expansion ) . as a matter of calculation technique",
    ", we have to set an appropriate time - step , @xmath44 , for these terms in order to proceed the stellar evolution calculation stably .",
    "we adopt @xmath45 ( but much larger than free - fall time scale ) just after the merger events to precisely follow kelvin - helmholtz contraction .",
    "as merged stars settle down to thermally stable state , we adopt larger @xmath46 .",
    "because collision products are not in thermally equilibrium states just after the mergers , we need to prepare an appropriate initial guess for the time evolution of physical variables ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 , and @xmath36 as functions of @xmath39 ) by the henyey method ; without this treatment we fail to follow the evolution of collision products , even though an appropriate @xmath44 is set . for an initial guess of the correction",
    ", we use a mixture of the structure of sph simulation and thermally relaxed structure ( e.q .",
    "zams ) that is determined separately .",
    "then , we derive the correct time - evolved structure by relaxation .",
    ".summary of the four runs .",
    "the third and fourth lines show the orbital eccentricity @xmath47 and initial tangential velocity of the stars .",
    "the last line gives the mass lost during the collisions ( @xmath48 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in all cases reported in the present work , the overall evolution is qualitatively similar : after a certain time , both stars are elongated by tidal interaction to form an extended merging product as shown in figures [ fig : sph_snap_eq ] and [ fig : sph_snap_ue ] , which depict the last phases of the merging processes for cases eq1 and ue1 respectively . however , the mass ratio and the orbital eccentricity of the merging stars influence the details of the merging processes .",
    "the mass ratio affects the material mixing in the interior of the merger products .",
    "figure [ fig : sph_snap_eq ] shows that the material is well mixed in the equal mass case , and the elemental abundance is almost homogeneous as will be shown later . on the other hand , in the unequal mass case ( figure [ fig : sph_snap_ue ] ) the less massive star ( star 2 ) , which has the higher central density , sinks to the center without sufficient mixing , and the more massive star ( star 1 ) forms an extended envelope .",
    "this is consistent with recent results for lower mass stars by @xcite . as a result , the elemental abundance is also inhomogeneous in the merger product .",
    "this difference of the material mixing affects the later evolution of the merged stars , which will be discussed in  [ sec : evcp ] .",
    "let us examine the material mixing during the mergers in more detail .",
    "figures [ fig : str2_eq ] and [ fig : str2_ue ] respectively compare the structure of collision products ( solid lines ) of eq1 and ue1 with the corresponding parent stars just before the mergers ( dashed and dotted lines ) .",
    "the 1d structure of the merged stars are reconstructed from the 3d results at the ends of the step ( 2 ) as explained in ",
    "[ sec : met ] . from top to bottom , density , @xmath37 , pressure , @xmath49 , an entropy variable , @xmath50 , and h and he abundances are plotted against mass radius , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a ratio of specific heats that is determined from the opal equation of state table .",
    "an entropy variable , @xmath50 , is useful to study the material mixing ; under the adiabatic condition convective stability in uniform media with gravity in @xmath53 direction reads @xmath54 ( schwartzschild criterion ) , and in convection zone @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a fluid element with smaller @xmath50 tends to sink into a central region during merger .",
    "the third panel of figure [ fig : str2_eq ] shows that in the parent star ( star 1 @xmath56 star 2 ) of eq1 the large convective core ( constant @xmath50 ) extends to @xmath57 . in the he - rich envelope , @xmath50 is larger by only @xmath58 0.2 dex except the region that is very near the surface .",
    "hence , the matter is well mixed during the merger because of the low entropy barrier . as a result of the mixing ,",
    "the gradients of the h and he abundances are very small ( the bottom panel figure [ fig : str2_eq ] ) .",
    "this result is in contrast to the collision of low mass main sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "@xcite performed the collision of two @xmath59 ms stars .",
    "they found that the mixing between the dense cores and the outer envelopes was inefficient .",
    "this is because the interior of a low mass star is occupied by a radiative core and the fraction of a surface convection zone is tiny in mass .",
    "thus , @xmath50 monotonically increases in the interior ; e.g. in @xmath59 , @xmath50 increases by nearly an order of magnitude from the center to the envelope @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the material mixing is inhibited during the merging by the large entropy barrier , which gives a clear contrast to our result for massive stars .",
    "next , let us move on to the collision of the unequal mass stars ( ue1 ; figure [ fig : str2_ue ] ) .",
    "the third panel shows that @xmath50 of the lower mass parent ( star 2 ; dotted line ) is smaller than that of the higher mass partner ( star 1 ; dashed line ) because the lower mass star has higher central density ( the top panel ) .",
    "owing to the small entropy the lower mass star ( star 2 ) sinks to the core of the merged stars without mixing , which was seen in figure [ fig : str2_ue ] . as a result ,",
    "the elemental abundances in the core reflect those of star 2 , while the abundances in the outer region reflect those of star 1 ( the bottom panel ) ; the merged star consists of the h - rich core and the he - rich envelope , which is opposed to usual evolved single stars .",
    "the orbital eccentricity controls the time for the stars to merge .",
    "figure [ fig : sph_distance ] shows the evolution of the distance between the centers of both stars . in the run with initially more eccentric orbit ( initially smaller pericenter distance ) , the stars merge more quickly than those in more circular orbit , mainly because the kinetic energy of the system is smaller ; eq1 takes @xmath60 days to merge whereas eq2 takes @xmath61 days .",
    "eq1 loses only 11.5 @xmath1 during the merging owing to the shorter collision duration , while eq2 loses a larger mass of 20.6 @xmath1 .",
    "despite the different merging time scales , the structures of the merged stars , eq1 and eq2 , are not so different after they settle down to dynamically stable states ( figure [ fig : sph1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the later evolution of the merged stars is not expected to be different between eq1 and eq2 .",
    "we found similar tendencies in the unequal mass cases , ue1 & ue2 ; in ue1 ( larger @xmath47 ) , the merger product settles down to a dynamically stable state faster and the mass lost during the merger is smaller , while the later evolution is essentially the same .",
    "as noted previously , the structures of the merged stars , eq1 and eq2 ( also ue1 and ue2 ) , are rather similar but angular momentum ( am ) distributions of the merged stars are slightly different .",
    "figure [ fig : eqrot ] shows am distribution as a function of mass radius for eq1 and eq2 .",
    "clearly , outer am distribution of eq2 is larger than that of eq1 because of the difference in the merging time scale .",
    "namely , during longer orbital revolutions in eq2 , more orbital am is transfered to outer material than in eq1 .",
    "similar trends are observed in ue1 and ue2 such that ue2 has slightly larger am in that outer region than ue1 .",
    "although we neglect the effect of rotation in step ( 3 ) ( evolution of merging stars ) in the present work , we expect this small difference in outer am distribution gives little influence on subsequent evolution of the merged stars .",
    "as explained earlier , we follow the evolution of the merged stars by the 1d stellar evolution code . since the mass ratio of the merging stars affects the structure of the merger products , and since the orbital eccentricity does not , we mainly study the evolution of eq1 and ue1 , and only briefly mention the results of eq2 and ue2 for comparison .",
    "first , we study in detail the stellar evolution without taking into account the effect of mass loss by stellar winds .",
    "later in  [ sec : ml ] , we present the results with mass loss for comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : str1_rhot ] shows the evolution of the stellar structure after the merging of the equal mass stars ( eq1 ) . on the left , temperature ( top ) and density ( bottom ) are plotted against @xmath62 , and on the right entropy variable @xmath50 ( top ) and elemental abundances are plotted as functions of @xmath51 . just after the merger the envelope is extended to @xmath63 , exhibiting a core - halo structure owing to the opacity peak around @xmath64k @xcite as shown in the left panels of figure [ fig : str1_rhot ] .",
    "the bottom right panel shows that the interior is well mixed during the merger ; the elemental abundance is almost homogeneous , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , even at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 are h and he abundances .",
    "this is mainly because the entropy gradient is small in the parents stars (  [ sec : msrt ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : str1_lr ] presents luminosity , @xmath69 , as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the total luminosity derived from equation ( [ eq : lmns ] ) at @xmath67 and 6460 yrs .",
    "the dotted line is the luminosity due to only nuclear reaction at @xmath67 .",
    "when we calculate this , we integrate the nuclear energy term ( @xmath42 ) on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : lmns ] ) . because the central density and temperature are lower than those in the thermal equilibrium state at @xmath67 , the contribution from the nuclear burning to the total luminosity is very small .",
    "instead , most of the energy comes from the gravitational contraction and it is transported outward by convection in the large convective core up to mass radius , @xmath70 ; the star is in a state similar to that of a pre - main sequence star .",
    "the total @xmath40 at @xmath67 ( solid line ) decreases outward between mass radii @xmath71 .",
    "this is because the liberated energy is not converted to radiation but to internal energy , namely the increase of the temperature in this region .",
    "after the merging , the star contracts towards the thermal equilibrium state on a kelvin - helmholtz timescale ( eq . [ eq : kh ] ) . the temperature and density increase ( the left panels of figure [ fig : str1_rhot ] ) , and the convective core , which is the region with constant @xmath50 , also grows until it occupies @xmath72% of the total mass ( the top - right panel of figure [ fig : str1_rhot ] ) . as a result , the elemental abundances become homogeneous inside @xmath73 ( the bottom - right panel of figure [ fig : str1_rhot ] ) . at @xmath74 yr after the merging , the star contracts to a minimum radius , @xmath75 , after which it expands gradually . at this time",
    "the star is in the stable h - burning phase , and the luminosity is all from the nuclear reaction ( figure [ fig : str1_lr ] ) .",
    "the later evolution traces the evolution of the chemically homogeneous single star with the corresponding mass and initial abundance , which we discuss below .",
    "figure [ fig : t - r1 ] summarizes the evolution of the radii of the merged stars ( eq1 as well as ue1 ; ue1 will be discussed in  [ sec : umcl ] ) , in comparison with those of the single stars with the same masses and similar abundances ( @xmath76 for eq1 and @xmath77 for ue1 ) .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates the monotonical contraction in @xmath78 yrs , which is followed by the gradual expansion during ms phase of stable h burning .",
    "the evolution during the ms phase is similar to that of the single star .",
    "the increase of the radii at @xmath79myr indicates the end of ms phase due to the exhaustion of h. our calculation shows that the ms lifetime of eq1 is @xmath80 myr , which is shorter than the corresponding lifetime ( @xmath81myr ) of a solar abundance star with the same mass due to the smaller initial h abundance .",
    "figure [ fig : hr1 ] shows the evolution of the merged stars in a hr ( hertzsprung - russel ) diagram ; the left panel shows the evolution of the four merged stars and the right panel compares the evolution of eq1 and ue1 with the corresponding single stars ( for the unequal mass cases , see  [ sec : umcl ] ) . through the initial contraction , the effective temperature , @xmath82 , of eq1 increases and @xmath21 decreases",
    "the position of the end of the kelvin - helmholtz contraction ( the turning point ) in the hr diagram is near the zams of the corresponding single stars ( triangles ) .",
    "the later evolution resembles that of the single stars as we stated previously .",
    "the evolution of eq2 ( smaller @xmath47 than eq1 ) is essentially similar to that of eq1 ( the left panel of figure [ fig : hr1 ] ) .",
    "because the mass is slightly smaller , the luminosity becomes lower ( figure [ fig : hr1 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath82 of eq2 just after the stable nuclear burning sets in ( the turning point in the hr diagram ) is slightly higher than that of eq1 , although the mass of eq2 is smaller .",
    "this is because more massive stars ( eq1 ) have more extreme core - halo structure to show lower @xmath82 ( ishii et al .",
    "chemically homogeneous zams stars of which masses exceed a certain limit also have this inverse trend . according to ishii et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath82 of solar metallicity stars decreases on increasing mass in the range of stellar mass @xmath83 , while less massive stars show the usual trend of the positive correlation between @xmath82 and stellar mass .      the evolution of the merger products of the unequal mass stars is different from that of the equal mass cases during the initial contraction phase , while the later evolution follows chemically homogeneous single stars with the corresponding masses and abundances in both cases .",
    "figures [ fig : str2_rhot ] and [ fig : str2_lr ] present the results of ue1 , which correspond to figures [ fig : str1_rhot ] and [ fig : str1_lr ] for eq1 . as we have shown in ",
    "[ sec : sph ] , the most important difference is that the interior is not well - mixed ( figures [ fig : sph_snap_ue ] and [ fig : str2_ue ] ) . just after the collision ,",
    "the lower mass parent star ( star 2 ) sinks to the center without sufficient mixing because it has a higher density and lower entropy .",
    "this star is more h - rich since the nuclear burning proceeds more slowly than in the massive partner ( the bottom panel of figure [ fig : str2_ue ] ) .",
    "therefore , the merged star consists of a h - rich core and a he - rich outer region as shown in the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] . reflecting the higher density in star 2 ,",
    "the density of the core of the collision product becomes slightly larger than the thermal equilibrium value , while the lower density envelope extends to the outer region ( the bottom - left panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) . due to the high density as well as the moderate temperature ,",
    "the nuclear burning takes place rather rapidly even just after the merging event in the unequal mass case ( figure [ fig : str2_lr ] ) .",
    "the energy release rate by the nuclear reaction exceeds the total luminosity because the nuclear energy is also used to increase the temperature ( internal energy ; the top - left panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) and to expand the core ( work on gas , i.e. , the decrease of the core density ; see the bottom - left panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the envelope also expands from @xmath84 yr to @xmath85 yr ( figures [ fig : t - r1 ] and [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) .",
    "in fact , at @xmath86 yr , the radius becomes , @xmath87 , which is larger than @xmath88 just after the merger ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "reflecting the initial expansion , the evolutionary path in the hr diagram ( figure [ fig : hr1 ] ) is also more complicated compared to the equal mass case .    during this phase ,",
    "the size of the convective core is small , @xmath89 , because the entropy ( the top - right panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) stays low in the core .",
    "therefore , the h - rich core is still preserved without mixing with the outer region ( the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) .",
    "incidently , the entire region outside @xmath90 becomes convectively stable with respect to the schwartzschild criterion , @xmath91 ( the top - right panel of [ fig : str2_rhot ] )",
    ". between @xmath92 , the gradient of mean molecular weight , @xmath93 , leads to mixing because heavier he is more abundant in the upper layer ; this region is unstable only by the ledoux criterion .",
    "note that this is opposed to usual situations , in which heavier elements are more abundant in a lower region and @xmath93 gradient contributes to stabilization .    the initial expansion between @xmath94 yr is followed by the usual contraction to the equilibrium state through thermal adjustment .",
    "the chemical abundance becomes homogeneous from inward as the convective core grows to @xmath95 .",
    "the minimum radius , @xmath96 , occurs at @xmath97 yr , roughly corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "the later evolution traces the evolution of the single homogeneous star , which is the same as in the equal mass case .",
    "the duration of the ms ( @xmath99myr ) is again shorter than the corresponding lifetime ( @xmath100myr ) for a solar abundance star .",
    "the evolution of ue2 is similar to the evolution of ue1 ( figure [ fig : hr1 ] ) : the merger product initially consists of a h - rich core and a he - rich envelope .",
    "although this structure is maintained at first due to the small convective core , the interior becomes homogeneous after @xmath101 yr as the convective core grows .",
    "the later evolution resembles the evolution of the corresponding single homogeneous star .",
    "so far we have not considered the effect of mass loss by radiation - driven stellar winds @xcite .",
    "however , it is supposed to affect the evolution of the merged massive stars .",
    "we study the evolution of eq1 and ue1 by explicitly taking into account mass loss in the stellar evolution calculations . here",
    "we have adopted the mass loss rate @xmath102 of solar metallicity gas from @xcite , which tabulates @xmath102 as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath82 , and metallicity on he abundance , @xmath103 , is not explicitly presented , observation of wolf - rayet stars shows that @xmath102 has a dependence on @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "our merger products are he - rich @xmath105 in the envelopes , compared to the sun ( @xmath106 ) , hence , @xmath102 could be be larger by a factor of 1.5 - 2 than that by @xcite .",
    "however , even if @xmath102 becomes larger by this extent , we suppose that the effect of the mass loss is not still crucial during the ms phase . ] .    in figures [ fig : t - r2 ] & [ fig : hr2 ]",
    "we show the evolution of eq1 and ue1 with mass loss , in comparison with the results without mass loss .",
    "our collision products have typically @xmath107 @xmath1/yr , and , @xmath108 is lost during the ms phase of @xmath111 - 2myr .",
    "the differences of the stellar radii between the cases with mass loss and the cases without mass loss are not large ( figure [ fig : t - r2 ] ) ; they are less than 10% except at the very end of the ms phase ( @xmath79myr in eq1 and @xmath109myr in ue1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hr2 ] illustrates that the luminosity becomes slightly smaller by @xmath110dex at later epochs because of the mass loss .",
    "once runaway collisions start in a dense cluster , the timescale of subsequent collisions is much shorter than 1myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , further stellar collisions of the merged stars would take place before the mass loss becomes important in the stellar evolution .",
    "metal - poor stars give even smaller mass loss rates than solar abundance stars .",
    "thus , we can conclude that stellar mass loss does not stop the increase in mass due to runaway collisions , provided that the metallicity is comparable to or smaller than the solar value .",
    "bearing in mind formation of supermassive stars and imbhs in dense star clusters , we have studied the hydrodynamical processes during collisions of massive stars and the evolution of the merger products .",
    "after the collisions , the merged stars settle down to dynamically stable states on typical timescales of days to weeks , well before they would undergo further collisions . during the merger events ,",
    "the stars typically lose @xmath111% of the total mass .",
    "the merger products are he - rich because of the nuclear burning of their parent stars .",
    "the interior of the merger product of equal - mass progenitors is well - mixed during this dynamical phase because of the low entropy barrier . on the other hand , during the merging of unequal - mass stars ,",
    "the less massive star sinks into the core , and the more massive partner is elongated by tidal interaction to finally form the envelope .",
    "since the nuclear burning took place slower in the less massive progenitor , the merged star consists of an h - rich core and an he - rich envelope .",
    "after the merger phase , the merged stars evolve to thermal equilibrium states on kelvin - helmholtz timescales , @xmath112 yr . the evolution of the collision product of equal mass stars is very similar to a pre - main sequence star ; the star monotonically contracts and the luminosity is mainly supplied from the release of gravitational energy . on the other hand , the evolution of the merger product of unequal mass stars is rather complicated due to the poorly mixed interior ; the nuclear burning is already switched on owing to the sufficiently dense core , and as a result , the star slightly expands at first , which is followed by the usual contraction .    just after the",
    "merging the radius is larger than the equilibrium value by a factor of 10 - 100 , while it goes down to a few times the equilibrium value in less than 1000 years ( see figure [ fig : t - r1 ] ) .",
    "n - body simulations that assume the mass - radius relation for ms stars show that collisions typically take place every @xmath113yr in a very dense region ( baumgardt et al .",
    "the collision probability will be enhanced when we take into account such realistic stellar radii .",
    "then , a small fraction of merged stars might experience further collisions during the initial contraction phase if they are in a very dense region . however , most of the collisions are off - axis , and we expect that such off - axis collisions simply blow away a tiny fraction of the outer envelope , rather than resulting in a merger , because its density is quite low ( figures [ fig : str1_rhot ] and [ fig : str2_rhot ] ) .    after the thermal adjustment phase , the merged stars enter a stable nuclear burning phase and their evolution is well approximated by those of single homogeneous stars with corresponding masses and abundances .",
    "an important point here is that the lifetimes of merger products are shorter than solar abundance stars with the same masses because they are already he - rich from the beginning .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed 3 myr as the lifetime of runaway stars for the stellar dynamics simulations .",
    "our result have shown that massive stars typically collide after 1myr from cluster formation and that the lifetime of the merged stars is @xmath112myr ; these results confirm that the assumption of 3myr is quite reasonable .",
    "this is robust even if merged stars experience further collisions because the collision products become more he ( or heavier element)-rich and their lifetime is short .",
    "our simulations show that neither mass loss during stellar collisions nor mass loss by the stellar winds prevents the growth in mass of the collision products .",
    "we can therefore anticipate that the scenario of the formation of supermassive stars by successive collisions @xcite is likely to occur in realistic situations .",
    "because of the nuclear burning , the merged stars become more h - poor .",
    "finally , the lifetimes of massive he - rich descendants are much shorter than those of solar abundance stars with corresponding masses .",
    "we speculate that the very end - products of runaway collisions would form imbhs quickly before suffering substantial mass loss ; the key is that the material which is finally taken in a supermassive star spends most of the time in less massive stars , which are not influenced by mass loss so much .",
    "therefore , supermassive stars are possibly formed by successive collisions , although it seems difficult through the evolution of very massive single stars @xcite .",
    "however , our present work does not quantitatively treat this final process . for such purpose",
    "we need to the study evolution of very massive ( @xmath4 ) and chemically evolved ( he - rich with abundance gradient ) stars .",
    "we plan to carry out such simulations in the future .",
    "the gravity calculation of the sph simulations has been done with reconfigurable computing board progrape-3 .",
    "nn would like to thank dr .",

    "they have concluded that @xmath115 per star is adequate to construct comprehensive tables for simulations of dense stellar systems .",
    "our main interest in the present work , which is different from theirs , is the fate of collision products of massive stars as a result of the stellar evolution .",
    "the results of the resolution tests for eq1 and ue1 runs are shown in figure [ fig : eq1comp ] .",
    "all the quantities are averaged over every 55 particles in mass coordinate . in both cases ,",
    "the runs with three times more n shows almost identical results to the corresponding original runs .",
    "moreover , we practically average the quantities of sph simulations of step ( 2 ) to give 1d spherical symmetric structure used in step ( 3 ) . then , fine details in the results are smoothed out and the tiny differences seen in figure [ fig : eq1comp ] have little impact on calculations in step ( 3 ) .",
