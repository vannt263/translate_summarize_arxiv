    "this formula is obtained by the evolution method of @xcite with respect to the variables @xmath330 , and it has the structure predicted by the general expression ( [ mutdiff ] ) for mutants .",
    "also it vanishes whenever any of @xmath330 is unity .",
    "this is because the pretzel knots with unit length always commutes with any other length due to identities like ( [ ramaid ] ) .",

    "it goes without saying that this overcomes most calculational complexities in knot / link theory . as an immediate illustration",
    ", we calculate a number of @xmath2$]-colored polynomials , and actually can now do this for many knots .",
    "particularly , this methodology helped us to explicitly illustrate / validate old expectations about the mutant pairs .",
    "specifically , we explained the conditions when mutants are distinguishable or indistinguishable by @xmath2$]-colored polynomials . for instance , the ktc mutant pair * can * be resolved by these polynomials , but the pretzel mutants made from antiparallel fingers of odd lengths * can not * be distinguished .    of greatest importance for knot theory",
    "are now three questions : + @xmath143 how large is the double fat tree family : what are the knots / links beyond it ( if any ? ) , and what is the way to find a double fat tree realization of a given knot / link ?",
    "@xmath143 what is the origin of ( [ basic ] ) and its effective field theory interpretation ? what could be the meaning of quantization and loop diagrams in this effective theory .",
    "@xmath143 what is the @xmath21-deformation of ( [ basic ] ) , i.e. can this powerful formula be lifted to the super- and khovanov - rozansky polynomials ?    added to these could be two obvious _ technical _ next steps :    @xmath143 to extend the double fat trees made from 4-strand braids propagators to arbitrary braids .",
    "the _ need _ for this for knot theory depends on the answer to the very first question .",
    "however , the problem itself can have its own value , especially because of its relation to multi - point conformal blocks .",
    "this approach will give complete solution provided we know the racah matrices for arbitrary representations in the multi - point conformal blocks .",

    "this requires calculating the simplest racah matrices describing the 2-bridge knots .",
