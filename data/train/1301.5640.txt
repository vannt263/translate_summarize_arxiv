    "it is now well - established that galaxies in the nearby universe separate rather cleanly into two classes : those with disky morphologies , plentiful gas and ongoing star formation and those that are bulge - dominated , with little gas and star formation , and where star formation has largely ceased ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the baryons in the universe are not locked up in stars , but reside in the circum - galactic medium associated with virialized dark matter halos or in a more diffuse phase in the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to postulate that the observed bimodality in galaxy properties is in some way linked with the ability of galaxies to accrete gas from the external environment .",
    "it is very difficult to probe gas infall onto galaxies directly . resolved studies of the stellar populations of galaxies may , however , provide some important clues as to how accretion may refuel galaxies .",
    "@xcite used a large sample of low inclination spiral galaxies with radially resolved b , r , k photometry to derive estimates of age and metallicity as a function of position within the galaxy .",
    "@xcite then interpreted these results using very simple models of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "they showed that a `` closed box '' model in which the star formation history and the metallicity of a given area in any galaxy depend only on the initial local gas surface density did not provide a good fit to the observational results .",
    "real galaxies had stronger age gradients than predicted , and the predicted slope of the age / central surface brightness correlation was steeper than observed .",
    "models which included infall of gas ( with an infall rate that was larger for low mass galaxies ) were required to fit the age / surface brightness relations .",
    "outflows were required to explain the observed correlation between stellar metallicity and galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite examined the specific star formation rate profiles of a sample of nearby , face - on spiral galaxies with uv photometry from the galex atlas of nearby galaxies @xcite and k - band photometry from the two micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "they showed that on average , galaxies were forming stars at higher relative rates in their outer regions compared to their inner regions .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that uv / optical colour gradients of galaxies are strongly correlated with their atomic gas content .",
    "gas - rich galaxies with high hi gas masses had stronger colour gradients than galaxies of the same stellar mass , size , and nuv - r colour with average hi content .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite interpreted their results in the context of an `` inside - out '' picture of disk galaxy formation , which has commonly served as a basis for semi - analytic models of the formation of discs in the context of cold dark matter cosmologies .",
    "the uv / optical colours of galaxies depend strongly on the amount of dust extinction in the galaxy and also are sensitive to star formation occurring over timescales of @xmath41 gyr @xcite .",
    "they thus can not be used to assess whether the recent star formation history of a galaxy has been smooth or episodic .",
    "combinations of narrow - band stellar absorption line indices , in particular the 4000   break strength and the equivalent widths of balmer absorption lines , such as h@xmath5 or h@xmath6 , are able to probe the recent star formation histories of galaxies in more detail .",
    "galaxies that have undergone a burst of star formation in the last 1 - 2 gyr will have stronger balmer absorption line equivalent widths for a given value of 4000   break strength , compared to galaxies that have been forming their stars continuously ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper aims to constrain the radial dependence of the recent star formation histories of disk galaxies .",
    "we compare spectral indices , the 4000@xmath7 break strength ( d@xmath84000 ) , a balmer line index derived using an approach based on principal component analysis ( pca ) , and the present - day star formation rate over stellar mass ( specific star formation rate ; ssfr ) to a library of models generated from the @xcite population synthesis code .",
    "we use the best fit models to constrain the timescale over which stars have been formed at different radii in the disk .",
    "we show that the star formation histories of many spiral galaxies can not be be described by simple exponentially declining star formation histories .",
    "additional recent ( @xmath9 2 gyr old ) episodes of star formation are required in order to fit d@xmath84000 , h@xmath10 and ssfr simultaneously .",
    "the mean fraction of stars formed in these recent episodes is similar in the inner and outer regions of galaxies , except for massive galaxies , where the bursts occur predominantly in the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "we also study how the recent star formation histories and gas - phase metallicities in the inner and outer regions of the galaxies in our sample correlate with their atomic and molecular gas content .",
    "our main result is that the recent star formation history and the metallicity in both the inner and outer regions of galaxies are strongly correlated with their total atomic gas mass fraction .",
    "in contrast , only the inner star formation history and metallicity are correlated with total molecular gas fraction .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the 21 cm and co(1 - 0 ) line data we use from gass @xcite and cold gass @xcite surveys and the long - slit spectroscopic observations from the mmt follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "we explain how we create a library of model spectra and use it to extract estimates of parameters such as burst mass fraction in section 3 . based on the results of the fits , we classify our sample galaxies into five groups according whether their star formation histories are best described by continuous or burst models in their inner and outer regions . in section 4",
    ", we examine how the fraction of galaxies in these different classes depends on their location in the plane of stellar mass versus stellar surface density / concentration / colour .",
    "we also examine how the fraction of stars formed both continuously and in bursts in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy depends on the location of galaxies in these planes .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "the data set on which this analysis is based has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the original parent sample consists of galaxies with hi line flux data from the arecibo telescope that were observed as part of the galex areceibo sdss ( gass ) survey ( catinella et al . 2010 ; 2012 ) .",
    "gass aimed to measure the neutral hydrogen content for a large , uniform sample of @xmath41000 massive galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath11 and redshifts in the range @xmath12 .",
    "no other selection criteria such as cuts on morphology , colour or gas content were applied .",
    "this sample thus provided an unbiased view of how the cold gas fraction related to the physical parameters of galaxies .",
    "the reader is referred to these papers for details about the sample selection and the hi observations .",
    "a subset of 300 galaxies were selected from this sample for co ( @xmath13 ) observations using the iram 30 m telescope @xcite . of these , around 200 galaxies now have reduced long - slit spectroscopy obtained from both the blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , az , and the dual imaging spectrograph on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ; see @xcite for details about the observational setup and data reduction ) .",
    "these galaxies were all selected at random from the gass sample .",
    "the wavelength ranges for mmt and apo observations are @xmath43900 - 7000   at a spectral resolution of @xmath44    ( 90 km s@xmath14 , and @xmath43800 - 9000    at a spectral resolution of @xmath46 - 8    ( 150 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the spectra were spatially binned outward from the galaxy center to ensure an adequate @xmath16 in each spatial bin .",
    "all bins have minimum extent equal to the slit width : 1.25@xmath17 for the mmt observations ) and 1.5@xmath17 for the apo observations .",
    "the bin size is typically @xmath93@xmath17 , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath41.5 - 3 kpc at the redshift of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the @xmath16 per bin is required to be larger than 15 ( per  ) in the inner regions of the galaxy . in the outer ,",
    "lower surface brightness regions , these requirements are progressively loosened in order to compromise between @xmath16 and spatial resolution : we adopt @xmath16 @xmath1810 for bins out to a distance of 4.5@xmath17 , @xmath16 @xmath188 for bins between 4.5 and 6@xmath17 and finally @xmath16 @xmath186 in the outermost bins . the spectra were flux - calibrated by matching to sdss @xmath19 and @xmath20-band photometry measured through an aperture matched to the slit .",
    "the o3n2 index @xcite was applied to estimate gas - phase metallicities .",
    "the empirical relation is 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.73 - 0.32 o3n2 , where o3n2 = log(([oiii]/h@xmath21)/([nii]/h@xmath22 ) ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the inferred metallicity gradient did not depend on the exact choice of indicator .",
    "all galaxies have nuv and fuv fluxes from the galex medium imaging survey .",
    "sdss @xmath20-band and galex nuv images were used to derive the nuv - r colours of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the sdss images were first degraded to the resolution of nuv images .",
    "the @xmath20-band and nuv magnitudes within kron elliptical apertures were obtained using sextractor @xcite and corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a more detailed explanation .",
    "global galaxy parameters such as stellar mass , stellar surface mass density , and concentration index were taken from the mpa / jhu value - added catalogs ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss ) .",
    "stellar masses were derived by fitting sdss photometry to stellar population synthesis models .",
    "stellar surface mass density was defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 was the radius containing 50% of the petrosian flux in @xmath25-band .",
    "concentration index was defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the radii enclosing 90% and 50% of the total @xmath20-band light .",
    "the use of  classic \" balmer absorption line lick indices such as h@xmath29 or h@xmath10 measured directly from the galaxy spectra can be problematic for two reasons : 1 ) because these indices are defined over a narrow range in wavelength , the signal - to - noise of the measurements is quite low , especially towards the outer regions of the galaxy , where the spectra may only have @xmath30 per pixel .",
    "2 ) in star - forming galaxies , the balmer absorption lines are filled in by emission . a robust measurement of the absorption line equivalent width hinges on subtracting this emission accurately",
    ".    if stellar population models fit the observed spectra accurately , they provide one way of solving the problem .",
    "because the models are fit to the spectra over a wide range in wavelength , the errors on balmer line indices derived from these fits decrease with respect to those for directly measured indices @xcite .",
    "in addition , the wavelength regions where emission may be present are masked when the fitting is carried out .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the principal component analysis ( pca ) method described in @xcite , which is an extension of the method described in @xcite .",
    "the principle of pca method is that a galaxy spectrum can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal principal components ( pcs ) , which can be linked to physical properties such as fraction of stars formed over the last gyr , or to estimates of indices such as d4000 , h@xmath29 , h@xmath10 using a library of star formation histories generated using population synthesis models . by comparing the amplitudes of the principal components of the observed spectra to those of the modelled spectra ,",
    "the likelihood distribution of such parameters can be calculated and thus constrained .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it improves our estimates of balmer absorption line equivalent widths , particularly for the spectral bins with poor @xmath16 in the outskirts of the galaxies .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details . in this work ,",
    "we find the linear combination of pc amplitudes that best represents the indices d4000 and h@xmath1 for each spectrum . a probability distribution function ( pdf ) for either d4000 or h@xmath1",
    "can be built using @xmath31 as weights .",
    "we use the median value of the pdf as our nominal estimate of the parameters , and the 16th to 84th percentile range of the pdf as the @xmath32 confidence interval .",
    "we compare two pca - derived spectral indices , which we will denote pca@xmath33 and pca@xmath34 , as well as the present - day star formation rate over stellar mass ( ssfr ) derived from the extinction - corrected h@xmath22 flux as described in @xcite , to a library of models generated from the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) population synthesis code .",
    "as we will demonstrate , these three quantities jointly place strong constraints on whether the galaxy has been forming stars smoothly or episodically over the past 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "we create a library of models by using the population synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "the underlying model has a continuous sfr , declining exponentially with time sfr@xmath35 , with @xmath5 uniformly distributed between 0 ( i.e. constant star formation rate ) and 1 gyr@xmath15 .",
    "stars begin to form at a look - back times between 13 gyr and 1.5 gyr .",
    "we then superimpose additional bursts of star formations onto these continuous models.4 gyr . as a result",
    ", an exponential model and other parametrizations such as a delayed exponential model will yield the same answers regarding burst requirements , because the timescale over which the h@xmath1 index becomes strong following a burst is @xmath41.5 gyr . ] the strength of the burst is defined as the fraction of the stellar mass produced by bursts relative to the total mass formed by continuous models , and is distributed logarithmically between 0.001 and 4 .",
    "bursts are described by top - hat functions and have durations between 3@xmath36 to 3@xmath37 years .",
    "the combination of balmer absorption lines and 4000   break strength is not sensitive to star formation episodes that have occurred longer than about @xmath38 gyr ago , so the bursts occur randomly between look - back times of 2 gyr and the present .",
    "the metallicity range of our models is distributed uniformly from 0.005 to 2.5@xmath39 .",
    "each model includes dust extinction based on the two - component model of @xcite , where the v - band optical depth @xmath40 follows a gaussian distribution with a peak at 1.78 and a width of @xmath41 = 0.55 .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution is truncated so that it only spans the range 0 - 4 .",
    "@xmath42 is the fraction of that optical depth affecting stellar populations older than 10 myr and is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "we first discard those spectral bins with contamination from background or foreground sources ( 3 spectral bins in total , originating from 2 galaxies ) .",
    "we also exclude the spectral bins with large errors in the pca indices  pca@xmath43 and pca@xmath33@xmath44 .",
    "this leaves a total of 2725 spectral bins out of the original 2812 bins .",
    "we first check whether the 2 pca indices and the ssfr can be fit using the library of continuous sf models .",
    "the bins where such fits fail are then fit with the full library of continuous and burst models .",
    "we have used both the best - fit model with minimum chi - square to estimate quantities such as the stellar mass formed in the past 2 gyr , as well as the median of the probability distribution function . in practice ,",
    "the two estimates yield virtually identical results ( see figs 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we record the stellar mass produced in the last 2 gyrs .",
    "when the continuous models do not provide acceptable fits within 1@xmath41 error of data , we also record the stellar mass produced in the burst mode during this time period .      in the following sections",
    ", we will often refer to the mass of recently formed stars in both the  inner \" and the  outer \" regions of the galaxy .",
    "we choose 0.7r@xmath45 as the nominal radius to partition our galaxies into inner versus outer spectral bins , where r@xmath45 is the radius enclosing 90 percent of the @xmath20-band petrosian flux . in @xcite",
    ", they found that there was a clear anti - correlation between the outer - disk metallicity ( r @xmath46 ) and the total galaxy hi fraction .",
    "we therefore follow their definitions of the inner and outer regions of galaxies .",
    "we weight each spectral bin by the stellar mass enclosed by the circular annulus formed by the inner and outer boundaries of the bin .",
    "we then calculate weighted averages of quantities such as the fraction of recently - formed stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity .",
    "we divide our galaxy sample into five classes according to their star formation histories in their inner and outer regions :    ( 1)type a : those that are well described by continuous models at all radii , i.e. the star formation histories are well described by a varying exponential decline time as a function of radius .",
    "type a galaxies have t@xmath47 ranging between 13 and 12 gyr in look - back time .",

    "( 4)type d : those that require bursts in both their inner and their outer regions .",
    "( 5)type e : those that require bursts only in their inner regions .",
    "the number of galaxies of type a , b , c , d , and e is 45 , 24 , 34 , 104 , 2 respectively . some examples of each type are presented in figs [ typeab ] and [ typecd ] .",

    "the rows are the same as in the previous figure . in the left column",
    ", we show the best - fit continuous models .",
    "as can be seen , in both cases such models generally work better near the centers of galaxies . in the outer regions , the deviations in the fit to pca@xmath34 and pca@xmath33",
    "become large .",
    "the right panels show how addition of a burst bring the models into much better agreement with the data .",
    "we note that the physical size of each bin for our sample is at least @xmath41.5 - 3kpc , and the discrepancies between the data and the continuous models often span more than 2 bins .",
    "this means that the bursts are not generated by individual hii regions , but span a significant portion of the outer disk .    in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] we plot the _ average _ deviation of the continuous models from the observations as a function of radius for type c ( upper panel ) and type d ( lower panel ) galaxies . in order to account for the fact that the observational errors increase as function of radius , we scale the deviation by @xmath41 before taking the average .",
    "as expected , the centers of type c galaxies are well fit , with the average deviation increasing towards the outer regions .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ sigma ] shows that the same general trend is also true for type d galaxies . in the central regions ,",
    "the average deviation from a continuous model is only @xmath48 , but in the outer regions the average deviation increases by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the main difference between galaxies with type c and type d star formation histories is stellar mass .",
    "galaxies with recent star formation only in their outer regions are predominantly systems with stellar masses greater than @xmath49 .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the fraction of galaxies with different types of star formation histories defined in section 3.5 depends on stellar mass , galaxy colour and structural parameters such as surface density and concentration .    for central galaxies ,",
    "stellar mass is a good tracer of the mass of dark matter halo in which the galaxy resides .",
    "the surface density of the galaxy is a rough measure of the degree to which the gas has lost angular momentum prior to being converted into stars .",
    "the concentration index is a good proxy for the bulge - to - disk or bulge - to - total luminosity ratio of the galaxy ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in the absence of dust , the global nuv - r colour is a measure of the average luminosity - weighted age of the stellar population . in order to understand whether the star formation history of a galaxy is determined primarily by its mass or by its structural properties , we will analyze sfh trends in _ two dimensional planes _ of stellar mass versus surface density and concentration .",
    "we will also examine how the fraction of stars formed both continuously and in bursts in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy depends on the location of the galaxies in these 2d planes .",
    "all galaxies are divided into 6 bins by dividing their stellar mass into 3 bins , 10.010.4 @xmath50 , 10.410.8 @xmath50 , and 10.811.2 @xmath50 in @xmath51 , and surface mass density into 2 bins : @xmath52 @xmath50 kpc@xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath50 kpc@xmath53 . in each bin , we calculate ( 1 ) the fraction of galaxies with different types of star formation histories ( left panel ) , ( 2 ) the fraction of the stellar mass formed within the last 2 gyr in the inner region , the outer region and in the entire galaxies ( right panel ) , ( 3 ) the fraction of the stellar mass formed in the _ burst mode _ in the last 2 gyr in the inner region , the outer region , and in the entire galaxy ( hashed histograms in the right panel ) .    as shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "we examine how star formation history depends on the gas content and gas - phase metallicity of a galaxy . in previous work",
    ", @xcite showed that around 10% of all galaxies with stellar masses greater than @xmath69 exhibit strong drops in gas - phase metallicity in their outer regions .",
    "these galaxies tended to have high hi content and to have actively star - forming outer disks .    in this analysis",
    ", we explore the correlations between the fraction of recently - formed stars and gas - phase metallicity in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy with both the hi and h@xmath68 gas mass fraction .",
    "we also explore how the correlations change as we vary the radius @xmath70 used to divide the inner galaxy from the outer galaxy .",
    "the spectral bins with only upper or lower limits on metallicity are discarded before we carry out our analysis . for each value of @xmath70 ( in units of r@xmath45 ) , we compute correlation coefficients of spearman rank tests for    * the relations between the fraction of stars formed in the inner / outer regions of the galaxy and total hi gas mass fraction . * the relations between the fraction of stars formed in the inner / outer regions of the galaxy and total h@xmath68 gas mass fraction .",
    "we only take into account the correlation coefficients with probability larger than 0.97 . for the coefficients with probability",
    "smaller than 0.97 , we set the coefficients to zero .",
    "( in practice , this only happens for the relations between outer star formation and metallicity and h@xmath68 gas mass fraction when @xmath70 is greater than @xmath27 . )",
    "[ gas ] summarizes the results of this exercise .",
    "@xmath71 is in units of r / r@xmath45 .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the results for the correlations with hi and h@xmath68 gas mass fraction , respectively .",
    "coefficients with values larger and smaller than zero indicate positive and anti - correlations between the parameters .    as can be seen in the upper panel of the figure , the fraction of recently - formed stars and the gas - phase metallicity in both the inner and the outer regions of the galaxy correlate strongly with the global atomic gas mass fraction .",
    "the strength of the correlations does not depend on the adopted value of @xmath70 , until @xmath70 reaches values greater than 0.9 r@xmath45 . at this point ,",
    "stronger correlations between the gas - phase metallicity and the fraction of stars formed in the outer regions and the total hi content are seen .",
    "interestingly , the correlation between the fraction of stars formed in the inner region of the galaxy and total hi gas fraction is independent of the value of @xmath70 .",
    "even as @xmath70 decreases to values near zero , there is still a correlation between the fraction of stars formed in the very inner regions of the galaxy and its total atomic gas content .",
    "we will discuss possible reasons for this in the next section .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ gas ] , we see that the gas - phase metallicity and the fraction of recently - formed stars in the inner regions of the galaxy are also both correlated with h@xmath68 mass fraction . the correlation of these inner quantities with h@xmath68 mass fraction is stronger than the correlation with hi mass fraction ( @xmath20 values of @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 ) .",
    "similar to what is seen for the atomic gas , the strength of the correlations of the inner quantities with h@xmath68 gas mass fraction are independent of @xmath70 .",
    "the outer quantities , however , are much more weakly correlated with h@xmath74 mass fraction and for @xmath75 , the correlations with h@xmath74 mass fraction disappear entirely .",
    "we now summarize our main results as follows :    \\(i ) by fitting stellar population models to the combination of ssfr , d4000 , h@xmath1 , we show that the star formation histories of many disk galaxies can not be accurately represented if the star formation rate has declined exponentially as a function of time .",
    "many galaxies have strong balmer absorption lines that require recent short - lived episodes of star formation in both their inner and in their outer regions .",
    "\\(ii ) the fraction of galaxies that have experienced such episodes in both their inner and outer regions is highest for systems with low stellar masses , low surface densities , and low concentrations , i.e. , late - type galaxies .",
    "\\(iii ) around a third of all massive ( @xmath63 ) , bulge - dominated galaxies have experienced recent star formation episodes only in their _ outer _ regions .",
    "\\(iv ) for low mass , disk - dominated galaxies , the fraction of stars formed in a single burst episode is typically around 15% of the total stellar mass in the inner regions of the galaxy and around 5% in the outer regions of the galaxy . when we average over the population , we find that such bursts contribute around a half of total mass in stars formed in the last 2 gyr .",
    "\\(v ) for massive galaxies ( @xmath63 ) , the fraction of stars formed in bursts is only @xmath3 % . averaging over the population , however , we find that such bursts contributed nearly all the mass in stars formed in the last 2 gyr .",
    "\\(vi ) the amount of recent star formation in both the inner and outer regions of a galaxy is positively - correlated with its total atomic gas content .",
    "in contrast , only the inner star formation is correlated with total molecular gas content .",
    "\\(vii ) very similar results are obtained for gas - phase metallicity .",
    "metallicity in both the inner and outer regions of galaxies are negatively correlated with global atomic gas fractions .",
    "the metallicity in the inner region of the galaxy is negatively correlated with the molecular gas mass fraction .",
    "we hypothesize that these results can be understood if galaxies accrete atomic gas and form stars episodically .",
    "the fact that episodic component of the star formation occurs primarily in the outer regions of massive galaxies ( right panels of figs .",
    "[ smd ] and [ cix ] ) argues that gas may be accreted at large radii .",
    "we note that the non - episodic ( continuous ) component of the star formation is much more evenly split between the inner and the outer regions in these systems .    in low mass galaxies , both the episodic and the continuous components of the star formation are evenly divided between the inner and outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "it is tempting to postulate that this may indicate that gas accretion occurs in a different mode in low mass systems  some theoretical models predict that gas should be accreting in the form of `` cold streams '' in dark matter halos with low mass , and from quasi - static atmospheres of hot gas in dark matter halos of high mass ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , our data does not allow us to rule out the possibility that the inner and outer bursts in galaxies may have different triggers , for example gas accretion may be the trigger in the outer regions and disk - driven instabilities in the inner regions .",
    "indeed , at fixed stellar mass , the fact that burst strengths are larger in the interiors of disk - dominated galaxies densities ( fig . [ f2gbst ] , top panel ) , argues that disk instabilities may indeed be key to the origin of the episodic nature of the inner star formation .",
    "the toomre q parameter scales inversely with disk surface density .",
    "the idea that gas accretion at large radii is followed by instability - triggered radial inflows of gas and a burst of star formation in the central regions of the galaxy is also consistent with our result that gas - phase metallicity and the fraction of recently formed stars in the inner region of the galaxy is best correlated with its molecular gas content .",
    "molecular gas extends to much smaller radii than the atomic gas in all disk galaxies and also exists at considerably higher surface densities @xcite .",
    "why then do metallicity and recent star formation in the inner regions of galaxies also correlate ( albeit more weakly ) with the total atomic gas content of the galaxy ?",
    "the most reasonable explanation , in our view , is that the atomic gas represents a longer - term _ reservoir _ for star formation in the inner galaxy . in other words ,",
    "if the galaxy has no atomic gas , there is simply no raw material to be transported inwards to be converted into molecular gas and stars at galactic centers .",
    "finally , we would like to note that we began this paper with the statement `` it is now well established that galaxies in the nearby universe separate rather cleanly into two classes : those with disky morphologies , plentiful gas and ongoing star formation and those that are bulge - dominated , with little gas and star formation , and where star formation has largely ceased . ''",
    "examination of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ smd ] indicates that even at high stellar masses , bulge - dominated galaxies have actually experienced a wide variety of different star formation histories .",
    "those that are `` dead '' in that they have not experienced any recent star formation episodes comprise less than half of the total population . in many of the massive , bulge - dominated galaxies",
    "star formation occurs in the outer regions of the galaxy , where the light has simply not been picked up by large scale redshift surveys that employ single fibre spectrographs .",
    "the fibres typically have diameters of 2 - 3 arcseconds and only sample light from the inner regions of the galaxies .",
    "the realization that many early - type galaxies do have extended star - forming disks first came from studies of early - type galaxies at ultra - violet wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and these results are now being confirmed by ifu studies of the nearby galaxy population @xcite .",
    "our study reveals that the star formation in these disks did not occur continuously over a hubble time , but was concentrated in a recent episode or burst . in future , large - scale integral field unit ( ifu )",
    "surveys of galaxies ( see for example @xcite ) will shed more light on the nature of the star formation in the far outer reaches of nearby galaxies .",
