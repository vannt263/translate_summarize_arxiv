    "this extends to the limit of homogeneous magnetization @xmath150 , where a complex phase modulation was found . in presence of the helical magnetic phase , a state of simultaneous complex phase and amplitude modulation develops , if the magnetic wavelength is large enough .",
    "we closed our discussion with the consideration of a magnetic state of filamentary solitons , which is obtained for a strong anisotropy parameter in the magnetic free energy .",
    "we found that this will force the order parameter of superconductivity to nucleate with the same filamentary structure , creating a stripe - like state with maxima in between two solitons .",
    "the complex phase winding of the order parameter of non - centrosymmetric superconductors that are exposed to a magnetic field was noticed theoretically a long time ago  @xcite , but an experimental verification of this state is still lacking .",
    "the inhomogeneous superconducting states that we find in this work show both complex phase and amplitude modulations .",
    "the latter would entail an anisotropic resistivity drop at the criticality for current directions perpendicular and parallel to the wavevector of the modulation and are therefore more accessible to an experimental observation .",
