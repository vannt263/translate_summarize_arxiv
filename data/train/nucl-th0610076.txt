    "pion - nucleon scattering is one of the main sources of information for the baryon spectrum . in addition",
    ", it also plays a fundamental role in the description of nuclear dynamics for which the @xmath0 off - shell amplitude serves as the basic input to most of the existing nuclear calculations at intermediate energies .",
    "knowledge about the off - shell @xmath0 amplitude is also essential in interpreting the experiments performed at the intermediate - energy electron accelerators in order to unravel the internal structure of these hadrons @xcite .",
    "it is hence important to have a sound theoretical description of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "it is commonly accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction . however , due to the confinement problem , it is still practically impossible to derive the @xmath0 interaction directly from qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "models based on meson - exchange ( mex ) pictures have been very successful in describing the @xmath10 scattering . over the past decade , mex approach has also been applied by several groups @xcite to construct models for @xmath0 scattering .    in previous works we have constructed several mex @xmath0 models within the three - dimensional reduction scheme of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite and investigated their sensitivity with respect to various three - dimensional reduction schemes .",
    "the model lagrangian included only @xmath11 and @xmath6 fields .",
    "it was found that all the resulting meson - exchange models can yield similarly good descriptions of @xmath0 scattering data up to @xmath12 mev . the model obtained with the cooper - jennings reduction scheme @xcite",
    "was recently extended up to a c.m .",
    "energy of 2 gev in the @xmath13 channel by including the @xmath7 channel and a set of higher @xmath13 resonances @xcite .",
    "the effects of the other @xmath14 channels like the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , instead of including them directly in the coupled - channels calculation , were taken into account by introducing a phenomenological term in the resonance propagators .",
    "an excellent fit to the t - matrix in both @xmath0 and @xmath7 channels was obtained . here",
    "we further extend the model to other higher partial waves up to the @xmath8waves .",
    "the mex @xmath0 model we previously constructed was obtained by using a three - dimensional reduction scheme of the bethe - salpeter equation for a model lagrangian involving @xmath18 and @xmath6 fields .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as the energy increases , two - pion channels like @xmath19 as well as a non - resonant continuum of @xmath20 states become increasingly important , and at the same time more and more nucleon resonances appear as intermediate states . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 model constructed in @xcite was extended for the @xmath13 partial wave by explicitly coupling the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath21 channels and including the couplings with higher baryon resonances .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the case when there is only one resonance @xmath22 contributing , the hilbert space was enlarged to include a bare @xmath13 resonance @xmath22 which acquires a width by its coupling with the @xmath0 and @xmath7 channels through the lagrangian @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath2 denote the field operators for the nucleon , bare @xmath22 , pion and eta meson , respectively . then the full @xmath25-matrix can be written as a system of coupled equations , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the @xmath1 , or",
    "@xmath2 channel and @xmath29 is the total center mass energy .    in general",
    ", the potential @xmath30 is a sum of non - resonant @xmath31 and bare resonance @xmath32 terms , @xmath33 the non - resonant term @xmath34 for the @xmath0 elastic channel contains contributions from the @xmath35- and @xmath36-channel , pseudovector born terms and @xmath25-channel contributions with @xmath37 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 exchange .",
    "the parameters in @xmath34 are fixed from the analysis of the pion scattering phase shifts for the @xmath38 and @xmath39waves at low energies ( @xmath40 mev ) @xcite . in channels involving @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath41 is taken to be zero since the @xmath42 coupling is very small .",
    "the bare resonance contribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the bare vertex operator for @xmath46 and bare mass of @xmath22 , respectively , arises from the excitation and de - excitation of the resonance @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix elements of the potential @xmath47 can be symbolically expressed in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the pion ( or eta ) momenta in the initial and final states , and @xmath51 is the resonance vertex couplings . as in @xcite",
    ", we associate with each external line of the particle @xmath52 in a feynman diagram a covariant form factor @xmath53^{n_\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the four - momentum , mass , and cut - off parameter of particle @xmath52 , respectively , and @xmath57 . as a result , @xmath58 depends on the product of three cut - off parameters .    in eq .",
    "( [ v_r1 ] ) we have included a phenomenological term @xmath59 in the resonance propagator to account for the @xmath14 decay channel .",
    "therefore , our `` bare '' resonance propagator already contains some renormalization or `` dressing '' effects due to the coupling with the @xmath14 channel . with this prescription",
    "we assume that any further non - resonant coupling mechanisms with the @xmath14 channel are small .",
    "the form of @xmath59 can be found in @xcite and is characterized by two parameters , a cut - off @xmath60 and the @xmath9 decay width at the resonance @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , one isolated resonance will contain five free parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the generalization of the coupled channels model to the case of @xmath3 resonances with the same quantum numbers is then given by @xmath64 with free parameters for the bare masses , @xmath9 widths , coupling constants , and cut - off parameters for each resonance .",
    "after solving the coupled channel equations , the next task is the extraction of the physical ( or `` dressed '' ) masses , partial widths , and branching ratios of the resonances .",
    "it is well - known this procedure is definitely model dependent , because the background and the resonance contributions can not be separated in a unique way . in this work",
    ", we employ the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in the case of pion - nucleon elastic scattering with only one resonance contributing , the full t - matrix is written as follows , @xmath65 where @xmath66 the `` background '' @xmath67 includes contributions not only from the background rescattering but also from intermediate resonance excitation .",
    "this is compensated by the fact that the resonance contribution @xmath68 now contains only the terms that start with the bare resonance vertex . in terms of self - energy and",
    "vertex functions , one obtains the result @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 @xmath71 describes the dressed vertex of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "@xmath73 is the self - energy of the dressed @xmath22 arising from one - pion intermediate states and @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the information about the physical mass and the total width of the resonance @xmath22 are contained in the dressed resonance propagator given in eq .",
    "( [ tr_dmt2 ] ) .",
    "the complex self - energy @xmath76 leads to a shift from the real `` bare '' mass to a complex and energy - dependent value .",
    "we characterize the resonance by energy - independent parameter that is obtained by solving the equation @xmath77 the solution of this equation , @xmath78 , corresponds to the energy at which the dressed propagator in eq .",
    "( [ tr_dmt2 ] ) is purely imaginary . the `` physical '' or `` dressed '' mass and the width of the resonance is then defined by , @xmath79    when there are n resonances contributing in the same channel , eq .",
    "( [ dmt ] ) can be generalized to take the form of @xmath80 the contribution from each resonance @xmath81 can be expressed in terms of the bare @xmath82 and dressed @xmath83 vertex operators as well as the resonance self energy derived from one - pion @xmath84 and two - pion @xmath85 channels , that is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bare mass of @xmath81 .",
    "the vertices for resonance excitation are obtained , in analogous to eqs .",
