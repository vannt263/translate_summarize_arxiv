    ", we also employ the helmholtz eos and the same 21-isotope network , newly implemented in flash  from the standalone public network .",
    "the approx21 network includes a very approximate treatment of heavy element neutronization important for the near - collapse isotopic evolution of the iron core .",
    "ideally , one would use a network with sufficient number of isotopes ( @xmath260  100 ) to treat the core neutronization and urca cooling directly . for simplicity , speed , and in order to maintain direct network equality between the 1d mesa  models and the 3d flash  simulations we use the reduced network .",

    "angle averages , @xmath10 , are taken over spherical shells and @xmath11 is the radial velocity component .",
    "evident from figure [ fig : models ] is that the convective speeds near collapse are typically @xmath12100 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the comparable speeds found in the o - burning shell @xcite . because the nuclear burning is balanced on average by turbulent dissipation , the energy generation rate is related to the average velocity and the depth of the convection zone by @xmath13 @xcite",
    "this is , however , the _ average _ convective speed , and fluctuations increase the peak speeds .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : viz ] that the peak speeds in the si - burning shell can be _ several _ hundred km s@xmath0 , reaching speeds near collapse of @xmath2500 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this is not negligible when compared to nominal infall speeds for core collapse initial models ( @xmath21000 km s@xmath0 ) . the speed of the convection increases as collapse approaches and the core contracts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : models ] we also show final 1d mesa  models at the point of collapse considering two different scenarios : one in which the neutronization reaction rate is enhanced by the same amount as in the 3d flash  simulation ( blue dashed lines ) and the other in which we do not enhance this reaction rate above the fiducial value found in mesa s approx21 network ( cyan dashed lines ) .",
    "stellar collapse is highly dynamic and the model profiles change rapidly once gravitational instability sets in .",
    "thus , for the sake of fair comparison , we consider all models at the point when the central densities have reached the same value as that of the final 3d flash  simulation ( @xmath14 g @xmath15 ) .",
    "varying the rate of neutronization has very little effect on the 1d mesa  profiles at the point of collapse .",
    "it does , however , dramatically change the time it takes to reach collapse . for the fiducial neutronization rate ,",
    "the mesa  model takes 1000 s to reach collapse from the model we used for the 3d ics ( i.e. , the black lines in figure [ fig : models ] ) . with the neutronization rate enhanced as we have done for the 3d flash  simulation ,",
    "the mesa  model requires just 40 s to reach collapse .",
    "this is faster even than the flash  simulation because the mesa  model , obviously , does not experience the initial transient pulsation that the 3d simulation must go through until vigorous convection is established .",
    "the final iron core masses of all models are similar , though correlated with the time it takes to reach collapse : 1.46 @xmath1  for the enhanced - rate mesa  model , 1.51 @xmath1  for the fiducial - rate mesa  model , and 1.50 @xmath1  for the 3d flash  simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : history ] shows the time evolution of the central density , central electron fraction , the mass of the iron core , the total kinetic energy , and the net nuclear energy release rate in the si - burning shell for the 3d flash  simulation .",
    "we define the si - burning shell as the region of the star where both the iron and silicon mass fractions exceed 0.001 . during the simulated time",
    ", the iron core mass grows from 1.3 @xmath1to 1.5 @xmath1 , while the central @xmath8 decreases from 0.432 to @xmath20.428 at collapse .",
    "the initial transient wave during the first 20 s is evident as an excess of radial kinetic energy in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : history ] .",
    "after the brief transient , the kinetic energy is dominated by convective motion in the si - burning shell until the collapse begins , around 160 s. the growth in the kinetic energy corresponds directly with a positive increase in the net nuclear energy release rate , which is negative because it is dominated by strong cooling from the central core .",
    "we expect that the convective kinetic energy is not unduly influenced by initial transient behavior because it reaches a near steady - state long before the end of the 3d simulation , and because we have simulated several convective eddy turnover times .",
    "assuming an average convective speed of 100 km s@xmath0 , and a width of the si - burning convective region of @xmath21000 km ( see figure [ fig : models ] ) , the turnover time is approximately @xmath16 s. driven convection / turbulence reaches a quasi - steady - state on roughly only a few turnover times .",

    "we quantify the spatial scale ( as well as strength ) of the turbulent convection in the si shell by measuring the turbulent kinetic energy power spectrum in spherical harmonic basis ( for details on how this is computed , see * ? ? ?",
    "for the 3d progenitor simulation near collapse , this is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the turbulent energy spectra peak at quite small @xmath17 ( large scale ) , around @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the largest eddies , which carry the bulk of the convective / turbulent kinetic energy , have roughly the same radial extent as the convective shell , precisely as observed in figure [ fig : viz ] .",
    "we have also analyzed the convection using the vector spherical harmonic framework of @xcite and find that the vector spectra also peak around @xmath19 .",
    "the final stages of nuclear burning in massive stars can excite waves that could have important implications for mass loss and angular momentum transport just prior to core collapse .",
    "we find that the si shell burning in the minutes before collapse drives non - spherical gravity waves that propagate both outward away from the core and _ inward _ into the iron core .",
    "previous multidimensional studies of late - stage stellar burning saw such phenomena but lacked fully dynamic inner cores and were not able to assess them accurately .",

    "our simulation approach is essentially identical to that of @xcite and @xcite , with the only major difference being that our 3d simulations here are carried out only in one octant , rather than the full star .",

    "the average shock radii between the two simulations is nearly identical until around 100 ms after bounce .",
    "this corresponds with the time at which the si shell interface is accreted through the shock surface . at this time",
    ", the shock in the full 3d ics model begins to expand more rapidly than for the 1d ics model , behavior that continues as both models transition to explosion .",
    "the second panel of figure [ fig : ccsn ] shows the neutrino heating efficiency , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the net charged current heating rate in the gain region , which is divided by the sum of the electron - type neutrino and antineutrino luminosities at the base of the gain layer .",
    "we find essentially no difference in the neutrino heating efficiencies between the two simulations .",
    "the same can be said also for the neutrino luminosities and the total gain - region heating rates . clearly , the cause for the divergence in the results between the 3d ics and the 1d ics is not due principally to differences in the neutrino heating or average gain region matter dwell times .",
    "our present results are consistent with the picture in which the differences are due primarily to different strengths of post - shock turbulence , and the attendant effective turbulent pressures that aid shock expansion @xcite .",
    "the third panel of figure [ fig : ccsn ] shows the total turbulent kinetic energies in the gain region for both simulations .",
    "the 3d ics simulation has greater turbulent energy after about 100 ms , following accretion of the si interface .",
    "there is also a larger `` burst '' of turbulent energy immediately post - bounce caused by the presence of aspherical , convection - generated waves in the inner part of the core right at bounce .",
    "we also find differences in the turbulent kinetic energy spectra between the 3d ics simulation and the 1d ics simulation .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : spectra ] show the turbulent energy spectra from the two collapse simulations at different radii : @xmath2300 km ( ahead of the shock ) and @xmath2150 km ( in the gain region ) .",
    "the spectrum for the 1d ics simulation for the region ahead of the shock , which should be essentially a spherically - symmetric accretion flow , quantifies the magnitude of the perturbations excited by our use of a cartesian grid .",
    "the turbulent energy in this region for the full 3d ics is an order of magnitude or more greater than this at all scales ( except @xmath24 ) .",
    "this translates into greater turbulent energy in the gain region , as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the 3d ics result in greater turbulent energy on large scales , between about @xmath25 , precisely where it is most effective at aiding shock expansion .",
    "the excess of power in the quadrupole @xmath26 mode is likely due to our use of an octant domain .",
    "the greater strength of turbulence excited by realistic 3d ics also results in a greater diagnostic explosion energy , as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : ccsn ] . here , the diagnostic explosion energy , @xmath27 , is the total energy of all gravitationally unbound material with net positive radial velocity .",
    "we note , however , that at the end of our simulations the explosion energies are not near their asymptotic final values , so caution should be used when interpreting the differences in the diagnostic explosion energies .",
    "we have carried out the first 3d simulation of the final growth of the iron core in a massive star up to the point of gravitational instability and collapse .",
    "the violent si burning in the shell surrounding the iron core drives large - scale , strong deviations from spherical symmetry that is not captured by 1d models .",
    "we show that this has a positive impact on the favorability for explosion via the delayed neutrino heating mechanism for ccsne .",
    "we were forced to make a number of approximations , e.g. , the use of a much reduced nuclear network , modifying electron capture rates , using mlt 1d initial models , simulating only one octant of the full star , and focussing on only one initial progenitor model .",
    "thus , crucial aspects of the final iron core , such as the electron fraction and entropy , may be affected .",
    "additionally , the presence of a si - burning shell at the moment of core collapse may be progenitor model - dependent .    compared to 2d simulations of si shell burning @xcite ,",
    "the maximum convective speeds we find are somewhat smaller , in agreement with 2d vs.  3d results found for o burning shells @xcite .",
    "the speeds we find are smaller , also , than those assumed in the parameterized velocity fluctuations employed by @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the impact we find on the ccsn mechanism may be less dramatic than that found by @xcite , though it is still significant .",
    "we show that the biggest impact of 3d ics is the enhancement of the strength of post - shock turbulence . greater turbulence behind the shock leads to a greater effective turbulent pressure and , thus",
    ", more favorable conditions for shock expansion and explosion .    realistic 3d simulations of the convective nuclear burning in massive stars , comparable to those used here , also suggest modifications to the mlt algorithms used in stellar evolution calculations @xcite . here , we have focussed on the impact that 3d ics have on the ccsn mechanism , showing that the breaking of spherical symmetry has a significant and positive impact on the likelihood for explosion .",
    "this is a critical finding since robust neutrino - driven explosions have been notoriously difficult to achieve across the broad range of ( spherically - symmetric ) progenitors studied to - date ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first 3d simulations including detailed neutrino physics indicate that explosion may be harder to attain than for 2d @xcite .    the ccsn `` problem , '' i.e.",
    ", the persistent difficulty in achieving robust explosions , has been with us for nearly a half century since the neutrino mechanism was introduced @xcite .",
    "most theoretical investigations of the ccsn mechanism have , however , employed spherically - symmetric , non - rotating , non - magnetic stars .",
    "it is well known that all stars rotate to some degree , are endowed with magnetic fields , and are spherically - symmetric only in the average sense .",
    "we have shown here that the detailed 3d structure of massive stellar cores , that is a natural and unavoidable result of the final stages of nuclear burning , has a big and important impact on the ccsn mechanism .",
    "additional investigation of the roles that rotation and magnetic fields play in both the pre - collapse evolution of massive stars and in the ccsn mechanism itself is needed , but taken together with realistic 3d progenitor structures , it is conceivable that attaining energetic explosions that reproduce the observable and statistical properties of ccsne @xcite may not be so challenging .",
    "that is , there might not be a ccsn `` problem '' per se , we may have just been using progenitor models that do not occur in nature , and given a set of progenitor models more representative of real massive stars , the `` problem '' may go away .    this work is a first step toward addressing these issues .",
    "it serves to a large extent as a proof - of - principle indication that the final minutes of massive star evolution can and should be simulated in 3d .",
    "doing so has a significant impact on the final structure of the core and on the ccsn mechanism .",
    "there is significant progress that must still be made in accurately simulating ccsn progenitors , including better models for mixing during the long , evolutionary phases of the star s life , and inclusion of realistic treatments for rotation and magnetism .",
