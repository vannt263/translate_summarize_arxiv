    "alfvn waves have been invoked as a driving force behind solar coronal heating and wind acceleration since their inception @xcite .",
    "while alfvnic waves have been detected in situ by several spacecraft in and out of the ecliptic @xcite , in the solar atmosphere their presence had only been inferred through the large non - thermal broadening of coronal emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "only recently were they directly observed and measured in the chromosphere @xcite with the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ hinode _ spacecraft @xcite and in the corona with the coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a subsequent investigation with the _ solar dynamics observatory _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ? * ) confirmed the ubiquity of coronal wave motions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is a significant discrepancy in the energy estimates between these three direct observations .",
    "the alfvnic wave energy flux in doppler motions of the 10747 emission line observed by comp is @xmath00.01  wm@xmath1 @xcite , some four orders of magnitude less than the 100  wm@xmath1 required to balance the radiative losses of the quiet corona @xcite and/or accelerate the fast solar wind @xcite .",
    "however , the observations of sot indicate that an alfvnic wave energy flux of order 4  kwm@xmath1 is present in the chromosphere @xcite and that even a very low transmission ( @xmath03% ) of these waves into the corona ( due to reflection off the transition region , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will result in an energy flux of the order of @xmath0100  wm@xmath1 into the corona or solar wind .",
    "in addition , the presence of _ at least _ that much wave energy is readily observed in the quiescent ( quiet and coronal hole ) corona with sdo / aia @xcite .",
    "this leaves us in a quandary : where is the missing wave energy in the comp observations ?",
    "interestingly , the coronal wave energy flux inferred from the sot observations ( and measured by aia ) is consistent with the amplitude of non - thermal broadening observed by comp , as reported by @xcite .",
    "so , perhaps the real energy flux of alfvnic waves in the corona is hidden from comp . in this scenario",
    ", the vastly different spatial scales of the instruments involved would result in considerable superposition of low frequency motions resolved by sot and aia but unresolved by comp , quenching the resolved velocity amplitude , energy flux , and increasing the non - thermal line broadening of the observed line profiles in the optically thin corona .",
    "an alternative scenario faces the challenging task of simultaneously explaining the large non - thermal broadening in the corona , and the observational evidence from aia of strong alfvnic waves throughout the corona .",
    "perhaps the filling factor of the waves observed with aia is much lower than estimated and/or the bulk of the alfvnic waves ( coming up from the chromosphere ) are actually damped and/or dissipated in the first few thousand kilometers above the limb , leaving only low resolved wave amplitudes for comp ?",
    "perhaps the non - thermal broadening of the coronal emission line is then caused by unresolved flows into and out of the plane - of - the - sky ( pos ) ?        in this letter we investigate these possible scenarios , address the apparent mis - match of alfvnic wave energies observed by sot , aia , and comp and thus constrain the potential sources of non - thermal broadening , the invariant hidden , or `` dark '' energy , in the quiet corona .",
    "we expand upon a simple forward model @xcite that explained the center - to - limb variation of transition region lines by taking into account that sot and aia observed a lower atmosphere dominated by a myriad of extremely fine - scale , field - aligned and independently moving structures , called spicules , with spatial widths @xmath2300 km ( considerably smaller than the @xmath04,500 km comp spatial sampling ) that exhibit significant transverse motions @xcite . in the following section we discuss the observations that drive the model . in sect .",
    "method , we discuss how the sot and aia observations are used to drive the model . in sect .",
    "analysis we look at the properties of the model that can reproduce the observed comp behavior .",
    "the comp observations used in this paper were obtained on december 26 , 2011 from 20:16 to 21:45ut in three wavelengths ( 10745.2 , 10746.5 , and 10847.8 ) across the 10747 line , with an exposure time of 250ms at each position .",
    "the image groups were obtained at a cadence of 30 seconds . from the three wavelength positions we measure the peak line intensity , doppler shift , and linewidth of the 10747 line .",
    "fitting a histogram to the measured velocities allows us to determine the coronal rotation rate and estimate the `` rest '' wavelength to be 10746.08 ( assuming that half of the field of view is red and half is blue - shifted ) . for an instrumental width ( @xmath3 ) of 21km / s and a thermal width ( @xmath4 ) of 21km / s for ( using @xmath5 , for an ion of mass @xmath6 and peak formation temperature of @xmath7 assuming that ion and electron temperatures are equal ) we determine the non - thermal width @xmath8 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the 1/e width of the fitted line profile .    the top row of fig .",
    "f1 compares an aia 193 image ( panel a ) taken at the start of the timeseries with the comp @xmath8 ( panel b ) and root - mean - square of the doppler velocity during the timeseries ( @xmath11 ; panel c ) .",
    "the latter is dominated by the resolved , low - frequency , and low - amplitude alfvnic waves that are seen to propagate in the corona .",
    "panel d shows a two - dimensional histogram of @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "we find a strong correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is an indication that the two measures are intimately tied , i.e. , the variation of the resolved wave amplitude during the timeseries and the non - thermal broadening of the line in a pixel / voxel are co - dependent .",
    "this suggests that whatever causes the strong non - thermal line broadening is related to the alfvnic waves that comp observes .",
    "note the clear cut - off at @xmath8=17 - 18km / s and the enclosing `` correlation wedge '' of the two dot - dashed lines .",
    "this wedge is a robust feature of the comp observations , shifting slightly left and right and tilting slightly up and down from day to day as the physical structure of the corona above the limb changes .",
    "supporting movies of sdo / aia ( ) 193 , comp i , v , and @xmath10 can be found in the electronic edition of the journal , the latter clearly illustrate the ubiquity of the transverse doppler motions .",
    "hinode / sot observations have shown that the chromospheric limb is dominated by superposition of a large number of long , thin ( @xmath12200 km ) spicules that extend to heights of 5 - 15 and that undergo significant motions along and perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there are two types of spicules present in the _ hinode _ limb observations .",
    "type i spicules evolve on timescales of 3 - 5 minutes reaching velocities of 10 - 40km / s along their long axis @xcite .",
    "type ii spicules on the other hand , occur on timescales of 10 - 120s and reach apparent longitudinal velocities of 50 - 150km / s .",
    "@xcite have shown , using a statistical approach , that these chromospheric features undergo vigorous alfvnic motions with amplitudes around @xmath13km / s and periods ranging from 100 to 500s .",
    "@xcite , using a similar approach , demonstrated that an energetically relevant portion of the alfvnic energy observed in the chromosphere by sot is indeed visible in emission formed at coronal temperatures .",
    "those waves have made it `` into '' the corona - these observations were made possible by the high s / n , low scattered light , high spatial resolution observations of aia .",
    "the imaged wave motions have amplitudes , periods , and speeds commensurate with those observed by sot near the limb , and can be considered the coronal extension @xcite of the chromospheric features studied by @xcite . the observed phase speeds of these coronal alfvnic waves reach 500 - 1000km / s , values that are commensurate with those observed by comp @xcite .",
    "we use the high resolution sot @xcite and aia @xcite observations as a guide for the transverse motions that occur on a spatial scale that is far smaller than comp resolution .",
    "we develop a ( simple ) monte - carlo forward model of alfvnic waves in the corona based on the concept of a `` thread '' , or elementary oscillating structure .",
    "our simple picture is that any pixel in the optically thin model corona can be populated with @xmath14 independent threads and the 10747 signal observed is given ( at any time ) by summing the emission of all of the threads in any given pixel .",
    "the properties of any single thread are as follows : a thread can appear at any time with a lifetime chosen from a gaussian distribution of 100 @xmath15 20s ; has a uniform brightness ; and is subject to alfvnic motion governed by a randomly chosen period , amplitude and phase .",
    "here we consider swaying motions , since those are clearly observed with aia .",
    "we assume a polarization angle chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath16 with respect to the los , and apply a @xmath17 correction factor to accommodate the fact that not all threads are radial ( where @xmath18 follows a gaussian distribution of 0@xmath1520 ) .",
    "the sinusoidal alfvnic motions of the thread have a period drawn from a distribution based on the comp power spectrum ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a phase from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath16 and an amplitude from a gaussian distribution around x@xmath155 km / s ( where x can be any value @xmath195km / s ) .",
    "each thread emits a gaussian line profile of width 21km / s ( equivalent to @xmath4 of the plasma ) at the given los velocity determined from its period , amplitude and phase .",
    "the resulting line profile in a pixel is the sum of the gaussians of the @xmath14 individual threads .",
    "( a ) and @xmath20 ( b ) measured from the monte - carlo simulated timeseries of three - point 10747 measurements for a range of thread numbers and input wave amplitudes .",
    "the white ( dot - dashed and solid ) lines show the 15 and 45km / s values of @xmath8 respectively , while the black ( dot - dashed and solid ) lines correspond to the 0.5 and 1.5km / s values of @xmath11 respectively .",
    "[ f3],width=321 ]    we then observe these synthetic profiles in the same fashion as the comp observations @xcite by sampling the 10747 line at the three wavelengths above with a gaussian filter width of 1.3 , and fitting the ensemble line profiles with a single gaussian to derive i , v , and @xmath20 .",
    "figure  f2 shows sample ( pixel ) timeseries of the doppler velocity ( and @xmath11 ; left column ) and non - thermal linewidth ( @xmath8 ; right column ) for a range of thread numbers ( bottom to top : 200 , 500 , 1000 , and 2000 ) and a fixed 40km / s wave ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "notice the diminishing values of @xmath11 with increasing thread number - these values eventually saturate at the gaussian fitting accuracy of the three - point measurements ( @xmath00.1 of the spectral resolution ) .",
    "notice also that @xmath8 @xmath22@xmath21 and the gradual increase in @xmath8 with increasing thread number and the reduction of its variance with time - recalling that @xcite noticed an invariance of the linewidths with time in their original measurements . to investigate any artifacts introduced by the three - point measurements ( red in fig .",
    "f2 ) , we also perform the same calculations of velocity and linewidth using synthetic data at considerably higher spectral resolution ( blue ) .",
    "we find that there is no significant difference in @xmath11 or @xmath8 for both spectral resolutions except in the case of large thread numbers where the profiles can become non - gaussian . in summary , it is clear from fig .",
    "f2 that our model can reproduce both the low amplitudes of the resolved alfvnic waves and large _ temporally invariant _ non - thermal line broadening observed with comp .    extending this computation to a broader range of models",
    "is straightforward .",
    "the panels of fig .  f3 show the variation in @xmath11 ( a ) and @xmath20 ( b ) for a range of thread numbers and input wave amplitudes where the other thread parameters remain as described above .",
    "the white ( dot - dashed and solid ) lines show the 15 and 45km / s values of @xmath8 respectively , while the black ( dot - dashed and solid ) lines correspond to the 0.25 and 1.5km / s values of @xmath11 respectively .",
    "these bounds encapsulate more than 75% of the analyzed pixels in panels b and c of fig .",
    "f1 . note that iso - contours of @xmath11 are approximately quadratic functions of the ( log of the ) thread number and input wave amplitude , whereas the measured linewidths almost directly reflect the input wave amplitude of the model ( for thread numbers larger than @xmath030 ) .",
    "one of the most stringent constraints from comp for our model is the correlation and peculiarly shaped correlation wedge that we found in fig .",
    "f1d between the @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "f4 that we can easily ( and naturally ) reproduce such a correlation of @xmath11 and @xmath8 and the wedge by using the data from the simple model presented in fig .",
    "we use the line - enclosed regions in the panels of fig  f3 ( which are driven by comp measurements ) , and apply other simple selection rules on the parameter set to best recover the correlation wedge .",
    "we find that the shape of the wedge is sensitive to the number of threads along the line of sight , the minimum wave amplitude and any additional broadening not due to swaying motions .",
    "panel a shows the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath8 when the minimum wave amplitude is allowed to be zero . to match the cut - off of the wedge at 17km / s shown in the observations of fig .",
    "f1 we need to add 17km / s of additional broadening .",
    "the maximum and minimum number of threads determines the lower and upper slopes of the wedge .",
    "while the slopes of the wedge are generally well reproduced , the low end of the wedge is too pointed and the scatter in @xmath11 does not fill the wedge .",
    "this implies that this parameter set is inadequate to reproduce the observed relationship .",
    "similarly , in panel b , we have omitted the additional broadening but , to match the observed low - end cut - off at 17km / s we must impose a minimum wave amplitude of 23km / s peak - to - peak ( which is equivalent to 16km / s rms ) .",
    "this parameter set is also inadequate : the slope of the wedge is too shallow and it does not fill the wedge at values of high @xmath11 and @xmath8 . finally ,",
    "in panel c , we show the optimal parameter set for this observation .",
    "the best match fills the wedge and requires a minimum wave amplitude of 14km / s peak - to - peak ( which is equivalent to 10km / s rms ) and an additional broadening of 14km / s rms .",
    "the high @xmath8 cut - off would indicate that the maximum wave amplitude present is 40km / s ( or 56km / s peak - to - peak ) .",
    "the upper bound of the wedge is determined by pixels that have low thread numbers where we find the best match is at 125 threads per voxel .",
    "the lower bound of the wedge is determined by the highest number of threads in a voxel where the best match is between 1200 and 1300 threads . in summary ,",
    "the correlation found from comp comes about naturally if the observations are dominated by superposition of vigorous alfvnic motions ( with properties similar to sot and aia ) along a los with a large and variable number of independently oscillating structures .     and",
    "@xmath8 values used to reproduce the variance observed in panel d of fig .",
    "the red dashed lines are taken from the bounds of the correlation wedge in fig .",
    "panel a has no minimum wave amplitude , minimum and maximum thread numbers of 110 and 1200 ( respectively ) , but requires 17km / s of additional broadening to match the observed cut - off velocity of the wedge .",
    "panel b has non additional broadening , minimum and maximum thread numbers of 300 and 1500 ( respectively ) , but requires 23km / s minimum wave amplitude to match the observed cut - off velocity of the wedge .",
    "panel c is the optimal solution with 14km / s additional broadening , a 14km / s minimum wave amplitude and thread limits as shown .",
    "[ f4],width=321 ]",
    "to understand the low values of the resolved comp wave amplitude we have constructed a simple monte - carlo model with only two variables : the input wave amplitude , and the number of emitting threads in a voxel .",
    "our model can reproduce the comp observations , even though it is based on the much larger wave amplitudes observed with sot and aia : comp measurements will see decreasing wave amplitudes and increasing linewidths with increasing complexity ( superposition ) of the emission along the los .",
    "we also see that the linewidths approach temporal invariance within the accuracy of the gaussian fit - this invariance was noted by @xcite .",
    "we note that the movies supporting fig .",
    "f1 show that in the less dense regions ( in coronal holes ) , the linewidths do show some periodicity with time .",
    "this would appear to be consistent with the lower panels of fig .",
    "f2 which show low amplitude variations of linewidths where the number of threads is smaller .",
    "the earlier deduction of complete temporal invariance @xcite may have been biased by the study of a single sub - region .",
    "we have also reproduced the wedge relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "this relationship comes about naturally if one limits the input wave amplitudes and assumes a minimum and maximum number of independently oscillating threads along the los . under the assumptions of our simplistic model",
    ", this would imply that observed comp wave amplitudes of @xmath01km / s are actually hiding the true wave amplitudes that range between 25 and 56km / s .",
    "further , the measured linewidths show an almost one - to - one relationship with the amplitude of the waves present ( fig  f3b ) , thus providing , in principle , an almost direct measure of the unresolved low - frequency wave energy .",
    "we note that the exact calibration between line broadening and wave amplitude of swaying motions is actually dependent on several assumptions ( see below ) .",
    "unresolved flows along the los likely contribute to the non - thermal line broadening observed with comp . in principle",
    ", such flows could even cause the correlation found in fig .",
    "f1d , as long as the flows are temporally varying ( @xmath11 ) . however , this is unlikely for a couple of reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath11 is not dominated by flows but by waves @xcite .",
    "second , as shown in fig .",
    "f5 , the upward - downward directed wave power ratio of @xcite shows the same correlation with the @xmath8 as @xmath11 . dividing the coronal cavity into its southern ( foreground ) and northern ( background ) portions by the dashed radial line we plot the correlation of @xmath8 and the directional wave power ratio . in both regions",
    "the relationship is linear , which supports the scenario in which @xmath8 is dominated by the propagating wave motions of the plasma and not by bulk coronal flows along the los .",
    "our simplistic model has several limitations .",
    "for example , we assume that the transverse motions are dominated by swaying , and not torsional , motions . the latter would not cause resolved doppler shift variations with time .",
    "it is possible that the additional broadening of 14km / s ( uncorrelated with @xmath11 ) required to reproduce the correlation wedge is a signature of such torsional motions",
    ". this would be consistent with recent observations of peak - to - peak amplitudes in spicules of order 20 - 30 km / s @xcite .",
    "it is also possible , as recent studies suggest , that some of the swaying motions couple to torsional modes .",
    "if such a coupling mechanism occurs in the corona ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amplitude of the torsional modes could be correlated with that of the swaying motions , so that the line broadening caused by torsional modes could actually be part of the broadening that _ is _ correlated with @xmath11 . in this case , torsional motions would _ not _ cause the additional broadening ( which instead could be caused by unresolved flows along the los ) .",
    "if this were the case , the observed correlation between @xmath11 ( from swaying ) and @xmath20would not necessarily all be caused by los superposition . in this scenario , the relative contributions of swaying and torsional motions likely change with height ( with increasing contributions from torsional motions higher up ) , because the coupling mechanism suggested by @xcite occurs over a finite time /distance during which waves propagate upward from the loop footpoints .",
    "taken at face value , our model would predict a very large number of independently oscillating threads along the los ( @xmath01 solar radius ) contained in one comp pixel ( 4,500 km ) .",
    "it may well be the case that the corona is extremely finely structured .",
    "however , the number of threads predicted by our model may be very different from the number of threads in the corona .",
    "this is because the exact number will critically depend on the mix of torsional and swaying motions , and on the ( perpendicular ) coherence of the waves .",
    "the latter is unknown : if phase mixing plays a significant role , wave amplitudes seen by comp can , in principle , be quenched much more efficiently than the completely independently oscillating threads assumed here .",
    "our data seem to exclude a scenario whereby high frequency alfvnic waves ( invoked by several models for the solar wind ) dominate non - thermal line broadening ( at least for heights @xmath250 mm ) .",
    "if the wave generation process low down predominantly created high frequency waves , with a small amount of wave power at low frequencies , one could in principle recover the correlation wedge .",
    "however , the aia and sot observations of strong , low frequency alfvnic swaying at low heights argue against such a scenario .",
