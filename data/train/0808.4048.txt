    "this system is composed of particles with a hard core of diameter @xmath0 , interacting via the following pair potential : @xmath1 where @xmath2 the parameter subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for `` attraction '' and `` repulsion '' respectively .",
    "in much of the work presented here we will follow imperio and reatto and select the following values for the pair potential parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7",

    "it is worth emphasising again that for some temperatures , these non - uniform structures are equilibrium ( ergodic ) states , having a non - zero probability for a particle to move from one cluster or stripe to another .",
    "however , as the temperature is decreased , this transition probability decreases . at low temperatures ,",
    "one finds the same sequence of phase transitions , but for these temperatures the particles can be frozen within the clusters or stripes .",
    "the possibility of a related glass transition should not be ruled out either @xcite .",
    "it should also be recalled that pattern formation in two dimensional model fluids composed of particles interacting via isotropic pair potentials is not restricted to generalisations of eqs .   and ",

    "one possible route to do this is perhaps by following the approach of ref .",

    "the present dft predicts that the equilibrium configuration in the stripe phase consists of an array of perfectly parallel stripes , displaying long range order .",
    "however , as we have noted already , the present dft is a mean field theory and neglects certain fluctuation contributions to the free energy .",
    "thus , although the minimum of the free energy corresponds to perfectly parallel stripes , in reality one should find that fluctuations about this minimum will destroy the long range order  see for example the discussion in refs .",
    "in fact , when one seeks for the minimum of the free energy , using as initial guess in the numerical procedure the noisy density profile given in , one finds that as the system size @xmath100 increases , there are an increasingly large number of metastable minima in the free energy .",

    "these density profiles are calculated for state points in the stripe phase ( upper figure ) and in the bubble phase ( lower figure ) .",
    "whilst the dft shows that such configurations corresponds to a minimum in the free energy , the theory does not reveal the height of the free energy barrier between this configuration and any other neighbouring configurations . in order to address the influence of fluctuations and to tackle the question of the size of the barriers between free energy minima",
    ", we propose to extend the present theory in the following manner : if one assumes over - damped stochastic equations of motion for the colloidal particles , then following the approach of ref .",

    "none of these models have long - ranged repulsive interactions between the particles , in contrast to the present system .",
    "this sequence of structures is only observed when these systems are constrained within a finite - sized box with periodic boundary conditions and with the number of particles fixed , so that the average density in the box is between that of the coexisting vapour and liquid phases @xcite .",
    "the cluster / stripe / bubble structures in these systems arise due to the constraint that the number of particles is fixed and the structures are unstable with respect to fluctuations in the density .",
    "in contrast to this , in the present system the configurations that we observe are stable equilibrium structures and do survive in an open ( grand - cannonical ) system .",
    "the long range repulsion between the particles stabilises the structures , in just the same way as the long - range repulsion stabilises the structures exhibited by three - dimensional fluids with competing interactions @xcite .",
