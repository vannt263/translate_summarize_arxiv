    "one of the fascinating features of proteins is their ability to lock into a specific , folded structure .",
    "this feature is often crucial to their function .",
    "a key structural unit which frequently appears in proteins is the helix .",
    "helical structures also appear in other molecules , such as in dna , homopolypeptides ( e.g. , polyalanine ) , as well as in some synthetic polymers .",
    "consequently , there has been a lot of interest in the helix - coil transition as a starting point to understanding the more general issue of protein folding .",
    "many detailed computer simulations on `` realistic '' interaction potential models have been conducted , to better understand the formation of helices in polypeptides and proteins ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these systems ,",
    "the formation of hydrogen bond interactions between different amino acid groups is principally responsible for the formation of the helix .",
    "helices also spontaneously form in simplified interaction models that have short - ranged , directional interactions between their constituent monomers @xcite .",
    "many theories have been developed to describe the helix - coil transition in homopolypeptides and other biological molecules , starting with the pioneering work of zimm and bragg @xcite and later followed by many others @xcite .",
    "the key feature of these theories is the characterization of a distinct helix and coil state for each residue in the peptide chain .",
    "this is justified for these systems because of the specific arrangement of the residues in the helix conformation and the large energies due to the formation of the hydrogen bonds .",
    "while these approaches have led to keen insights for helix formation in polypeptide and protein molecules , they are dependent on the fact that short - ranged , directional interactions drive the formation of the helix structure . in these molecules , one can argue that the helix structure has been `` built '' in .",
    "can the helix structure occur in molecules without these specific interactions , and if so , what then controls its geometry ? it has been suggested that the helix is a stationary configuration for semi - flexible chains  @xcite , and the optimal shape of flexible  @xcite and closely packed , compact  @xcite strings .",
    "this hints at a more general driving force for helix formation in real proteins and may explain why the structure is so prolific in nature . in order to gain some more general understanding of the mechanisms behind helix formation",
    ", we examine the square - well homopolymer model .",
    "this is a simple polymer model composed of linearly bonded , hard spheres that interact with each other through an isotropic square - well attraction .",
    "isolated square - well homopolymers exhibit the typical coil to globule transition observed in many polymers as the temperature is decreased below the theta point ; however , they also freeze into compact , crystal - like structures @xcite at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , magee et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that , by introducing stiffness , the square - well homopolymer model can fold into a helix structure .",
    "this is a remarkable result , as the model is achiral and yet it spontaneously breaks symmetry and folds into left or right handed helices .",
    "this is merely a result of the polymer being stiff , having an excluded volume and an attractive self interaction .",
    "an exact analysis of the density of states of square - well tetramers and pentamers was performed @xcite to examine the relationship between the distributions and correlations of the torsional angles in these fragments to the stability of the helix in longer length chains .",
    "however , the question still remains as to what controls the geometry and the stability of the helical structures formed by these molecules .    in this work ,",
    "we use molecular dynamics , combined with the replica exchange method , to explore the behavior of square - well homopolymers to better understand the link between the interactions between the monomers of the chain and the overall structure of the molecule .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the range of conditions over which the helix structure is stable .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sim ] describes the details of the square - well homopolymer model that we investigate in this work .",
    "in addition , it provides background information on the simulation methods we employed and outlines the procedures used to generate and analyze the resulting simulation data .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in section  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "this section begins with an overview of the general behavior exhibited by the square - well homopolymers .",
    "then , it continues by analyzing and discussing the influence of the bond length ( or equivalently monomer size ) , the range of attraction between monomers , and the total number of monomers in the polymer on the structure and thermodynamic behavior of the homopolymer .",
    "finally , the major findings of this work are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the polymer model that we study in this work is a chain of linearly bonded monomers .",
    "monomers that are not directly bonded together interact with each other through the potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the distance between the centers of the monomers .",
    "each monomer is a hard sphere of diameter @xmath3 , surrounded by an attractive square well of diameter @xmath4 .",
    "when two monomers are within a distance @xmath4 , they feel an attractive interaction energy of magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "monomers that are directly bonded together interact with each other through the potential @xmath6 the bond length is nominally equal to @xmath7 but is allowed to fluctuate between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . if @xmath10 , then directly bonded monomers in the chain overlap .",
    "monomers that are not directly bonded together other are not allowed to overlap each other .",
    "this induces a stiffness in the polymer , due to the restrictions on the allowed bond angles imposed by the excluded volume interaction between monomers separated by two bonds . in the limit that @xmath11 approaches @xmath12",

    "we use constant temperature molecular dynamics ( md ) to investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of the square - well polymer chains over a range of temperatures .",
    "the temperature of the simulations was maintained with the andersen thermostat @xcite .",
    "the basic algorithm that we employ to perform the md simulations is based on the one originally developed by alder and wainwright @xcite .",
    "several subsequent advances have significantly improved the computational speed of this original algorithm .",
    "these include the use of overlapping cells @xcite , the delayed states algorithm @xcite , and calender event queues @xcite .",
    "we have incorporated these advances in order to construct a code where the computational cost of the simulation is independent of the number of particles @xmath16 in the system .",
    "one shortcoming of molecular dynamics is that it is prone to becoming trapped in local energy minima , especially at low temperatures . in particular for conditions where",
    "helical or other `` frozen '' structures are formed , the homopolymer may become locked within a specific configuration . using only molecular dynamics , the helices formed by the square - well polymers are stable over the length of accessible simulation times and rarely transform between the left and right handed forms .",
    "this makes the study of the equilibrium behavior of these systems at low temperatures extremely formidable .    to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "the md simulations are coupled with the replica exchange / parallel tempering method @xcite . in this technique , several molecular dynamics simulations , each at a different temperature ,",
    "are run simultaneously ; a monte carlo move is added to exchange chain configurations between simulations at different temperatures .",
    "a configuration that is locked at a low temperature may then move up in temperature , unfold , and drop in temperature to sample another configuration .",
    "this enables the systems to rapidly overcome local energy minima and better explore the full range of available configurations .",
    "the effectiveness of the replica exchange method depends on the choice of the temperatures of the individual simulations . in order to determine the optimal values of these temperatures",
    ", we use an approach recently developed by katzgraber et al .",
    "this maximizes the number of configurations that travel between the lowest and highest temperature simulations , as modeled by a one - dimensional diffusion process . a typical optimal distribution of system temperatures is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : replicaexinfo ] , along with the resulting exchange rates .",
    "the optimization procedure clusters the simulation temperatures near conditions where the polymer undergoes structural changes with significant topological differences",

    "optimal distribution of system temperatures is given by the solid line , and the acceptance ratio of the replica exchange move for adjacent temperature systems is given by the dashed line . ]    a series of @xmath20 molecular dynamics simulations , combined with the replica exchange method , is performed to examine the properties of square - well homopolymers over a range of values for @xmath11 , @xmath0 , and @xmath16 .",
    "for each particular chain , @xmath21 temperatures are used , and the systems are equilibrated for @xmath22 attempted replica exchange moves .",
    "the replica exchange move consists of selecting @xmath23 random pairs and attempting to swap the configuration between each pair . between each replica exchange move ,",
    "the dynamics of the isolated polymers is run for a few hundred mean free times . following an initial equilibration period ,",
    "data are collected over @xmath24 attempted replica exchange moves .",
    "the collected data are then interpolated using multiple histogram reweighting  @xcite to obtain smooth heat capacity curves as a function of the temperature .",

    "to characterize the rigidity ( i.e. , `` frozen '' vs.  flexible ) of the structure of the homopolymer at a particular temperature , we collect @xmath26 configurations of the polymer at regular intervals in time during the course of the simulation ( here we choose 10 replica exchange times ) . for each sampled configuration @xmath27",
    ", we then determine the average @xmath28 of the root mean square difference ( rmsd ) against all other collected configurations , which is given by @xmath29where the rmsd between two configurations @xmath27 and @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\]]and @xmath32 is the position of monomer @xmath33 in the polymer of configuration @xmath27 .",
    "the reported value of the rmsd between a pair of configurations is the minimum value obtained by rotating  @xcite and reflecting the configurations , as well as reversing the numbering sequence of the monomers .",
    "we consider the configuration with the lowest value of @xmath28 as the most representative of the entire set of sampled configurations of the homopolymer .",
    "the average rmsd of this configuration , denoted by @xmath34 , is used to indicate how rigid the polymer structure is at a given temperature ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "low values of @xmath34 suggest that the homopolymer remains `` frozen '' within same structural configuration .",
    "high values of @xmath34 indicate that the homopolymer is not well characterized by a single structure .",
    "this can imply that the homopolymer is in a rather flexible state , such as a coil or a molten globule . however , high values of @xmath34 could also result if the homopolymer can be `` frozen '' into several distinct configurations , such as in a glassy state . using cluster analysis of the distance matrix formed by the rmsd s of every pair of sample configurations , it is possible to estimate the number of stable states and thereby distinguish between these two situations .",

    "the locations within the contact map are shaded according to how often two monomers interact with each other ( i.e.  within a distance @xmath4 ) .",
    "black denotes no interaction , white denotes continuous interaction , and gray denotes intermittent interaction . for monomers that are bonded together ( along the diagonal ) ,",
    "we have shaded the entries in the contact map black . for the case where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , monomers that are separated by two bonds are always in each others attractive well due to the overlap and result in two off - diagonal white bands .    at higher temperatures ( point @xmath37 ) , the polymer is extended , and the contact map indicates that the monomers of the polymer are rarely in contact with each other .",
    "the optimal configuration rmsd ( @xmath34 ) also indicates that the typical configuration is not locked but , instead , is quite flexible . upon decreasing the temperature , a shoulder in the heat capacity marks the transition from an extended coil to a globule state @xmath39 .",
    "the contact map indicates that while monomers do interact significantly with each other , they do not remain in continuous contact with the same monomers , and , therefore , the contact map is primarily gray .",
    "although the polymer has collapsed into a compact structure , it contains no regular structure and @xmath34 remains high .",
    "decreasing the temperature still further ( point @xmath40 ) , we see that the polymer changes from an unstructured globule to a more ordered helical structure .",

    "we examine how the structure of square - well homopolymers is affected by the monomer size ( @xmath11 ) , the range of the attractive interaction ( @xmath0 ) , and the length of the polymer chain ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "the main effect of changing the monomer size is to alter the local stiffness of the polymer chain . decreasing the size of the monomers ( or increasing the bond length ) increases the flexibility of the homopolymer .",
    "the stiffness of a polymer chain can be characterized by the bond correlation function , which is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the orientation of the @xmath45 bond in the polymer , and @xmath46 is the position of the @xmath45 monomer .",

    "not shown ) , there are no correlations between the bonds , and the polymer behaves essentially as a random walk . at intermediate values of the overlap parameter ,",
    "the excluded volume interactions between monomers separated by several bonds enhance the correlations between the bonds , and the correlation function decays algebraically , rather than exponentially .",
    "for @xmath49 , the decay is nearly exponential because the chain is too stiff for there to be significant excluded volume interactions between the monomers .",

    "the comparatively high value of the rmsd for these polymers , however , indicates that the structures that they freeze into are not unique .",

    "this coincides with the onset of the region of low values for @xmath54 , where homopolymers fold into the helix 1 , 2 , and 3 structures . here , the homopolymers fold into a single , helical conformation ( neglecting the distinction between the left and right handed configurations ) . a significant portion of the folded parameter space",
    "is occupied by the helix 3 structure , which is the most rigid of the helix structures .    at high overlaps , the values of @xmath34 are on average lower due to the stiffness of the chain limiting the range of motion of the monomers .",
    "there is a sharp transition at @xmath55 with an increase in @xmath34 along the line of the heat capacity peaks . for polymers with a well width of @xmath19 , two monomers separated by 4 bonds can not interact with each other when @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "if we account for the fact that in the simulations the bonds can stretch by @xmath57 , then this would occur at @xmath58 , which coincides with loss of the helix 1 structure .",
    "it appears that the observed helix structures are closely related to the constraint of interactions between monomers in the chain .",
    "the values at which certain interactions become prohibited depends on the well width @xmath0 , and the effect of this parameter is explored in the next section .",

    "the increased stiffness of the chain is limiting the curvature of the helix formed , thus requiring more monomers per turn of the helix .",
    "it appears that the typical `` glassy '' behavior of the longer polymers has been eliminated for the examined chain lengths .",
    "therefore , the maximum chain length displaying a helical structure must be determined using qt analysis and visual inspection .",
    "the last chain length where a single helix structure is stable is @xmath69 , yet for the longer chain lengths ( @xmath82 ) , the folded structures remain unique and not glassy . a single structure , which we refer to as the `` barbers pole '' structure ,",

    "chains with a higher value of @xmath11 appear to favor a single folded structure at longer chain lengths than compared to more flexible chains .",
    "this is understandable as in the limit of a rigid chain there is only one possible physical configuration .",

    "the stability of the helix structure is related to the constriction / elimination of interactions between monomers separated by a number of bonds in the chain .",

    ". the lower limit appears to be related to the number of monomers in a single turn of the stable helix structure . above a critical chain length , the isolated homopolymer folds into a rapidly increasing number of stable states , displaying characteristics reminiscent of a glass transition .",
    "these structures are more compact and spherical than their lower @xmath16 counterparts , result from a minimization of the surface area to volume ratio of the polymer .    finally , as the stiffness of the homopolymer is increased ( @xmath83 ) the number of observed folded states in longer chain lengths is reduced . at an overlap of @xmath84 , we only observe unique folded states for the range of polymer lengths studied ( @xmath85 ) ."
