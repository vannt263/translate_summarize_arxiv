    "the majority of massive stars reside in binary systems @xcite and can lose a significant fraction of their initial mass because of interaction with their companion stars through mass transfer , common envelope evolution or merger .",
    "in addition to binary interaction processes , the copious stellar winds of the most massive stars also significantly reduce their initial masses . the material lost by massive stars can , in principle , be detected as parsec - scale circumstellar nebulae .",
    "but since these stars form in star clusters and the majority of them end their lives there , the origin of coherent ( observable ) nebulae around stars residing in their parent clusters is hampered by the effect of stellar winds and ionizing emission from nearby massive stars . on the other hand , about 20% of ob stars escape from their birth places because of dynamical encounters with other massive stars or because of supernova explosions in binary systems @xcite . these so - called runaway stars are more suitable for producing observable circumstellar nebulae because they are not exposed to destructive influence of nearby massive stars .",
    "indeed , the vast majority of known circumstellar nebulae are associated with stars located either in the field ( e.g. nebulae around the bona fide lbvs agcar and hrcar ) or at the outskirts of their parent clusters ( e.g. the pistol nebula ) .    among stars of different evolutionary stages",
    "the circumstellar nebulae are very common for lbvs , of which more than 70% have associated nebulae @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar nebulae can also be found around late nitrogen sequence wolf - rayet stars and blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , and less frequently around red supergiants , be and b[e ] stars .",
    "the detection of nebulae reminiscent of those associated with known massive stars serves as a strong indication that their central stars are massive as well .",
    "indeed , follow - up spectroscopy of stars selected in this way has led to the discovery of many dozens of massive stars at various evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "given the high percentage of lbvs having circumstellar nebulae , it is not surprising that many of the newly identified massive stars show lbv - like spectra and therefore were classified as candidate lbvs ( clbvs ) . in this paper , we give a census of ( c)lbvs revealed with _ spitzer _ and _ wise _ , and present some new results of spectroscopic observations of central stars of mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) nebulae .",
    "because of high visual extinction in the galactic plane  close to which the majority of massive stars are concentrated",
    " the most effective way for detection of circumstellar nebulae is through mid - ir observations . using data from various _",
    "legacy programmes and the _ wise _ all - sky survey @xcite , we detected about 250 nebulae with central stars .",
    "these nebulae have a wide range of morphologies , ranging from circular and ring - like to bipolar and more complex forms ( see fig.[lbv ] ) .",
    "115 of them were discovered with _ spitzer _ by 2010 and presented in @xcite , while others were detected later on with either _ spitzer _ or _",
    "wise_. almost all of the nebulae were found in the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m or _ wise _",
    "22@xmath0 m images",
    ". a two times lower angular resolution of the _ wise _ data resulted in that the nebulae detected with this telescope have , in general , larger angular dimensions , which suggests that they are located at closer distances .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the percentage of _ wise _ nebulae having optical counterparts is higher than that among the nebulae detected with _",
    "( see fig.[neb ] for three examples of such _ wise _ nebulae ) .",
    "the majority of the central stars are either invisible or dim in the optical band . to determine their nature , one needs therefore to use ir telescopes or large ( 810-m class ) optical ones .",
    "fig.[vlt ] ( right panel ) shows _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m images of five nebulae , whose central stars are visible only in the ir and whose @xmath1-band spectra , taken with the isaac spectrograph on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , are presented in the same figure ( left panel ) .",
    "interestingly , although all five nebulae look quite different , their spectra are very similar to each other and to those of known lbvs ( see e.g. fig.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests a classification of these stars as clbvs .",
    ".candidate and bona fide lbvs discovered with _",
    "spitzer _ and _ wise_.

    "moreover , follow - up spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of some of these clbvs revealed significant changes in the spectra and brightness of four of them , wray16 - 137 @xcite , ws1 @xcite , mn44 @xcite and mn48 @xcite , implying that these stars belong to the family of galactic bona fide lbvs , which currently consists of 18 members ( see table2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in table1",
    "we give a current census of candidate and bona fide lbvs discovered with _",
    "spitzer _ and _",
    "wise_.    in fig.[lbv ] ( left panel ) we show images of nebulae around 36 clbvs to further illustrate the variety of shapes inherent to these nebulae . in the same figure ( right panel )",
    ", we also show nebulae around 6 bsgs : from up to bottom , respectively , ws3 ( or bd+60@xmath172668 ) , mn18 , ws29 ( or als19653 ) , mn94 , mn108 and mn113 .",
    "one can see that the nebulae associated with both types of stars show a wide range of morphologies and that individual objects from one group of nebulae have close counterparts among nebulae from the other group .",
    "possible implications of this similarity is that ( i ) some bsgs might be dormant lbvs , ( ii ) nebulae around some ( c)lbvs might be formed during the preceding evolutionary stages and therefore their origin is not necessarily related to episodes of enhanced mass loss experienced by lbvs .",
    "also , the variety of shapes inherent to nebulae around ( c)lbvs and bsgs suggests that several mechanisms might be responsible for their formation and , perhaps , for triggering the lbv activity of massive stars .",
    "finally , in figs[bsg - spec ] and [ neb ] we present spectra and images at several wavelengths of two of the six bsgs shown in fig.[lbv ] .",
    "both these bsgs , ws3 and ws29 , were discovered through detection of their circumstellar nebulae with _",
    "wise _ and both nebulae have optical counterparts , detected respectively in the int photometric h@xmath18 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the digitized sky surveyii ( dss - ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the central star of ws3 consists of two components ( separated by about 3 arcsec ) , which we classify as b0ib and b5 - 6ib .",
    "note also that ws29 is indicated in the simbad data base as a planetary nebula ( pn ) , while our spectroscopy shows that it is a b0ib star .",
    "it should be noted that only two of the newly - discovered mid - ir nebulae with central stars , namely mn102 and ws31 , turn out to be pne , and both of them have optical counterparts .",
    "mn102 was discovered with _",
    "spitzer _ and its central star is of [ wc ] type ( gvaramadze et al . 2010c ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "ws31 was detected with _",
    "wise_. in the 22 and 12@xmath0 m images it appears as a circular nebula without a central star ( fig.[neb ] , right panel ) , which is also not visible in other _ wise _ and all 2mass ( two micron all - sky survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) wavebands .",
    "surprisingly , we found that this nebula has an obvious , previously unknown , counterpart in the dss - ii red band image .",
    "we identified the central star of the nebula with a blue star at ra(j2000)=@xmath19 and dec.(j2000)=@xmath20 ( marked in the dss - ii image by a white circle ) .",
