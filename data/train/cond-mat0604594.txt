    "<S> we predict an unusual electron - hole conversion in graphene ( a single atomic layer of carbon , with a relativistic energy spectrum @xcite ) . while usually the hole is reflected back along the path of the incident electron ( retro - reflection ) , the andreev reflection is specular in undoped graphene ( see fig .  [ reflections ] ) . </S>",
