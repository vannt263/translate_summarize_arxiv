    "for the lattice domain - wall fermion formulation there are two independent approaches which can be used to reduce the residual chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath0 ) for practical sizes of @xmath1 . one way is to modify the fermion part of the action and another way is to improve the gauge action used . in this paper we take the second approach by studying the dbw2 gauge action in dynamical dwf calculations and considering the effects of also adding an adjoint term to the gauge action .",
    "the dbw2 gauge action reduces @xmath0 at finite @xmath1 in quenched dwf simulations by suppressing the topological lattice dislocations in the gauge field configurations@xcite .",
    "these simulations@xcite find that @xmath0 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding value for the wilson action at a given lattice scale .",
    "here we investigate the size of that improvement for the corresponding dynamical dwf cases at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the form of the dbw2 action is as follows :    @xmath2@xmath3    it is a renormalization group improved action where @xmath4 is nonperturbatively computed@xcite .",
    "we extend the study of lattice dislocation suppression by adding an adjoint term to the dbw2 gauge action for the dynamical dwf case in the hope that it will improve further @xmath0 in the strong coupling sector without affecting the long distance physics much .",
    "as a measure of the residual chiral symmetry breaking we use the ratio@xcite :    @xmath5    table  1 contains the parameters of the dynamical zero - temperature runs and the respective values for @xmath0 .",
    "the main feature of these results is that @xmath0 significantly increases with the gauge coupling . for the weak coupling of @xmath6",
    ", @xmath0 is quite small and appears independent of the quark mass . for the strongest coupling from table  1 , @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath0 has risen to as much as one third of the input quark mass .",
