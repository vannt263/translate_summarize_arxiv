    "analyses of observations of galaxy clusters via their x - ray emission , gravitational lensing or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect are often based on some parameterised cluster model for the distribution of the cluster dark matter and the thermodynamical properties of its intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the accuracy and robustness of cluster parameters derived from studies at different wavelengths depend greatly on how well the model describes the physical properties of the cluster , and the assumptions made regarding the dynamical state of the cluster and its gas content .",
    "cluster models typically assume spherical symmetry , an ideal gas equation - of - state , and parameterised functional forms for the radial distribution of two linearly - independent cluster properties , such as electron density and temperature ( sanderson & ponman 2003 ; vikhlinin et  al .",

    "such parameterisations are usually supplemented by the imposition of a condition on the dynamical state of the cluster , most commonly hydrostatic equilibrium or a virial relation , together sometimes with further constraints , such as a constant gas fraction throughout the cluster and/or assorted scaling relations .",
    "all such models , with their corresponding assumptions , have the potential to introduce biases in the derived cluster physical parameters , depending strongly on the appropriateness of the assumptions made and whether or not the data can constrain the parameters describing the model ( see ami consortium : olamaie et  al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "a recent interesting example of a parameterised spherical cluster model by mroczkowski ( 2011 ) assumes the cluster dark matter density to follow a parameterised navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) ( navarro et  al .",
    "1997 ) profile and the gas pressure to be described by a generalised nfw ( gnfw ) profile ( nagai et  al . 2007 ) with fixed shape parameters , both in accordance with numerical simulations .",
    "this model also assumes hydrostatic equilibrium and , crucially , a constant gas fraction ( both local and enclosed ) throughout the cluster , which is a very stringent condition . in this paper",
    ", we adapt this model by replacing this last condition , which is in fact inconsistent with the rest of the model , by the much weaker assumption that the local gas fraction throughout the cluster is small compared with unity .",
    "we show that this assumption leads to a unique solution for the radial dependence of all the cluster properties of interest ( dependent on basic cluster parameters ) .",
    "further , we analyse six simulated clusters and one real cluster ( a611 ) in this frame work through their sunyaev zeldovich effect and show that the resulting profiles agree with those predicted by numerical simulations and measured in multi - wavelength observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "the first assumption in our model is a functional form for the dark matter density @xmath0 .",
    "cosmological @xmath1-body simulations suggest that all dark matter halos can be modelled with the spherically averaged density profile of navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) ( navarro et  al .",

    "2005 , 2006 ; nagai 2006 ; nagai et  al . 2007 ) both show that self - similarity is more likely to be observed in the gas pressure profile than the density or temperature at large radii , i.e. up to @xmath10 and beyond .",
    "the gas pressure is also the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non - gravitational mechanisms inside the icm . in particular , following nagai et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we assume the electron pressure follows the gnfw profile @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an overall normalisation coefficient , @xmath13 is the scale radius .",
    "it is common to define the latter in terms of @xmath14 , the radius at which the mean enclosed density is 500 times the critical density at the cluster redshift , and the gas concentration parameter , @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 describe the slopes of the pressure profile at @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . in the simplest case , we follow arnaud et  al .",

    "they estimated @xmath21 for each cluster in their sample using the standard @xmath22 scaling relation ( see appendix b in arnaud et  al .",
    "it should be noted that these values are different from those used by nagai et  al .",

    "the arnaud values were , however , used to analyse sz data from the planck survey data ( planck collaboration 2011d ) .",
    "more generally , one can allow the parameters @xmath23 to vary , although we will not consider this case here .",
    "given the electron pressure , the gas pressure is then defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( mason & myers 2000 ) is the mean gas mass per electron , @xmath26 is the mean mass per gas particle and @xmath27 is the proton mass .",
    "our third assumption concerns the dynamical state of the cluster , which we take to be in hydrostatic equilibrium throughout .",
    "thus , the total cluster mass internal to radius @xmath28 is related to the gas pressure gradient at that radius by @xmath29 however , we note that the latest cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters with focus on studying the cluster outskirts ( lau et  al . 2009 ; battaglia et  al . 2010 ; nagai 2011 ; nagai & lau 2011 ; parrish et  al .",

    "however , as the studies of this kind ( to understand the physics of the cluster outskirts and make accurate measurements of the icm profiles in the cluster outer regions ) are still ongoing , we do not study a modified form of hse here .",
    "we , of course , aim to consider a more general form in our future analyses .",
    "finally , our model is completed by assuming that the local gas fraction is much less than unity throughout the cluster , i.e. @xmath30 for all @xmath28 .",
    "this final assumption allows us to write @xmath31 .",
    "we emphasize that this assumption is for the gravitational part of the calculation and as we show in equation ( [ eq : rhogas ] ) we do not assume @xmath32 .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : dmdensity ] ) , the total mass enclosed with a radius @xmath28 has the analytical solution @xmath33 substituting this form and the expressions ( [ eq : gnfw ] ) and ( [ eq : pgas ] ) for the gas pressure into the condition ( [ eq : hse ] ) for hydrostatic equilibrium , one may derive the gas density profile @xmath34^{-\\left(\\frac { { { a +   b - c } } } { { a}}\\right)}\\left [ { b } \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm p}}\\right)^ { a } + { c } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radial profile of the electron number density is then trivially obtained using @xmath35 .",

    "we can also determine the radial profile for electron entropy of the icm . in the astronomy literature",
    ", for an adiabatic monatomic gas , entropy is defined as @xmath39 which is related to the true thermodynamic entropy per gas particle via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant ( voit 2005 ) .",
    "the only fundamental cluster property for which the radial profile can not be expressed in an explicit analytical form is the gas mass enclosed within radius @xmath28 , @xmath42 for the gas density profile in ( [ eq : rhogas ] ) , we have been unable to evaluate this expression analytically , and so @xmath43 must be obtained using numerical integration .",
    "consequently , the enclosed gas mass fraction profile @xmath44 also can not be written in closed form .",
    "it is clear , however , that the resulting @xmath45 will not be constant .",
    "therefore , this contradicts the assumption of mroczkowski ( 2011 ) of @xmath46 being constant . in the next section",
    ", we represent the profile of @xmath47 which illustrates this point .",
    "in the simplest case , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 in ( [ eq : gnfw ] ) have fixed values , our cluster model depends only on three parameters : @xmath52 and @xmath4 in the nfw dark matter density profile ( [ eq : dmdensity ] ) and @xmath53 in the pressure profile ( [ eq : gnfw ] ) .",
    "one is , however , free to choose alternative parameters to define a cluster , although this choice and the priors imposed on the parameters can lead to very different results in the analysis of cluster observations ( ami consortium : olamaie et al .",

    "we will define clusters in terms of the parameter set @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the redshift @xmath57 , and investigate the resulting radial profiles of quantities of interest in our cluster model .    for illustration purposes , we will consider clusters at a fixed redshift @xmath58 .",

    "<S> we present an analytic parametric model to describe the baryonic and dark matter distributions in clusters of galaxies with spherical symmetry . it is assumed that the dark matter density follows a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile and that the gas pressure is described by a generalised nfw ( gnfw ) profile . by further demanding hydrostatic equilibrium and that the local gas fraction is small throughout the cluster , one obtains unique functional forms , dependent on basic cluster parameters , for the radial profiles of all the properties of interest in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we show these profiles are consistent both with numerical simulations and multi - wavelength observations of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we also use our model to analyse six simulated sz clusters as well as a611 sz data from the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) . in each case </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the radial profile of the enclosed total mass and the gas pressure and show that the results are in good agreement with our model prediction .    </S>",
