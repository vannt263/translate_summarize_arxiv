    "typically , the schiff moment has a single - particle order of magnitude value as confirmed by various calculations of nuclear structure , see for example @xcite ; the core polarization effects can increase the result by a factor of order 2 .",
    "it is however known that there exist promising collective mechanisms which must be explored in the search of the many - body enhancement of the schiff moment .",

    "the requirements of static octupole deformation can be relaxed since almost the same effect can be reached @xcite when static quadrupole deformation is combined with a soft octupole vibrational mode .",
    "similarly to the case of static octupole deformation , where the enhancement effect is proportional to the square @xmath10 of the octupole deformation parameter , here the analogous result contains the dynamic mean square value @xmath11 that has the same order of magnitude being proportional to the inverse soft mode frequency , @xmath12 .",
    "this significantly widens the set of nuclear candidates where one can expect the collective enhancement of the schiff moment .",
    "there is a theoretical possibility that the enhancement may occur even in the absence of static quadrupole deformation due to the combination of _ quadrupole and octupole soft modes _ @xcite .",
    "this would broaden even further the possibilities for the experimental search of the edm adding , for example , such nuclei as light isotopes of radium and radon , where the presence of both soft modes with strong dipole transitions connecting corresponding vibrational bands is well known @xcite . although phenomenological estimates @xcite supported this idea , the detailed microscopic calculation @xcite based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and quasiparticle - phonon coupling gave essentially negative results .",
    "the effect of strong enhancement was found only in the unphysical limit of very low vibrational frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , the applicability of the rpa to the situation of strong interaction of low - frequency collective modes is questionable and that result might be an artifact of the inappropriate approximation .    in the current work we present a simplified model , where an unpaired particle interacts with two coupled soft collective modes .",
    "this interaction is effectively strong and creates a _ coherent state ( condensate ) of phonons _ although the even core is still spherical .",
    "such a situation can not be adequately treated in the rpa framework .",
    "we consider both the approximate analytical approach and exact numerical solution .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the existence of a parameter region , where we see the strong enhancement of the nuclear schiff moment . on the other hand ,",
    "the whole problem is quite interesting irrespectively of the symmetry violations , for the study of nuclear structure in the situation of shape instability due to the presence of soft modes .",

    "the exact calculation does not introduce any intrinsic frame and fully preserves rotational symmetry and ( in the absence of the weak interaction ) parity of stationary states . although the model studied above had a limited single - particle space and a small number of valence particles that precludes the appearance of very strong collectivity , the presence of the enhancement is visible .",
    "we pointed out the difference between the analytical consideration and the numerical model in the character of the interaction between the quadrupole and octupole modes .",
    "the numerical study , being exact in the framework of the two - level model , assumed the conventional two - body hamiltonian .",
    "then the coexistence of the modes of incompatible symmetry is suppressed by their destructive competition for the available supply of single - particle excitations .",

    "such cubic anharmonicities are rather weak if considered in the next order of the random phase approximation built on the two - body multipole - multipole interaction . however , currently there is a broad discussion of the role of three - body forces , see for example @xcite , in the nuclear structure beyond light nuclei .",
    "the possible collective effects of three - body forces ( in this respect it does not really matter , bare or effectively induced in nuclear matter ) were briefly discussed , in relation to various physical phenomena in nuclear physics , in @xcite .",
    "one of the main new effects is the emergence of three - phonon anharmonicity .",
