    "the multifractal behaviour of the financial time - series has become one the acknowledged stylized facts in the literature ( see : @xcite ) .",
    "many works have been dedicated to its empirical characterization @xcite , reporting strong evidence of its presence in financial markets , and models @xcite .",
    "understanding which is the origin of the measured multifractality in financial markets is still an open research challenge .",
    "this question has been raised first in @xcite where the authors pointed out that the power law tails and the autocorrelation of the analysed time - series must be the two sources of the measured multifractality . in the first case ,",
    "the multifractal behaviour is a consequence of the broadness of the unconditional distribution of the returns ; while in the second case , the multifractal behaviour is associated with the causal structure of the time - series .",
    "after @xcite , many papers have investigated the relative contribution of these two sources to the measured multifractality , however no agreement exists .",
    "for example in @xcite the author points out that the autocorrelation structure has a minor impact on the measured multifractality while the power law tails are the major source of it . in @xcite",
    "they also report that the power law tails give the major contribution , but they also point out that the presence of unknown autocorrelations might introduce a negative bias effect in the quantification of multifractality .",
    "conversely , in @xcite the authors find that the autocorrelation gives the major contribution while for a specific time - series the `` extreme events are actually inimical to the multifractal scaling '' .",
    "this lack of agreement motivated our work , leading us to investigate what the source of the measured multifractality is and how it can be detected .    in this paper",
    "we quantify the two contributions by using synthetic times series where the two contributions can be separated .",
    "specifically we analyze brownian motion with innovations drawn from a t - student distribution , multifractal random walk and normalized version of the multifractal random walk .",
    "the measured multifractality on these synthetic series are compared with measures on both real financial log - returns and on a normalized version of the real log - returns where the heavy tails are removed .",
    "the results show the aggregation horizon has a strong effect on the quantification of multifractality .",
    "we verify however that there are regions of the aggregation horizon that can be used in practice to extract reliable multifractality estimators .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ background ] we perform a brief literature review introducing the tools we used for our analysis and discussing the results from previous works . in sec .",
    "[ section_methods ] we review the theoretical models we used and we define the multifractality estimators that shall be used throughout the paper . secs .",
    "[ sec_source ] and [ section_real ] are dedicated respectively to the analysis of artificial and real data . in sec .",
    "[ section_discussion ] we discuss the results while in sec .",
    "[ section_summary ] we summarize the results and conclude .",
    "among the methods which are used for the empirical measurement of the scaling exponents , in this work we will use only the _",
    "generalized hurst exponent method _ ( ghe ) , see @xcite which relies on the measurement of the direct scaling of the @xmath1th - order moments of the distribution of the increments and it has been shown to be one of the most reliable estimators @xcite .",
    "let us call @xmath2 a process with stationary increments .",
    "the ghe method considers the following function of the increments @xmath3=k(q)\\tau^{qh(q)},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the time horizon over which the increments are computed and @xmath5 is the generalized hurst exponent .",
    "the function @xmath6 is concave and @xmath7 depends also on @xmath1 . in particular , ghe considers the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ moments_scaling ] ) @xmath8\\right)=\\zeta(q)\\ln(\\tau)+\\ln\\left(k(q)\\right),\\ ] ] and , if linearity with respect to @xmath9 holds , it computes the slopes of the straight lines at different @xmath1 .",
    "the slopes are computed in the following way : for every @xmath1 , several linear fits are computed taking @xmath10 $ ] , with usually @xmath11 and several values of @xmath12 typically between @xmath13 $ ] ; the output estimator for @xmath14 is the average of these values for a given @xmath1 .",
    "this method gives also the errors which are the standard deviations of these values .",
    "however , in this paper we do not perform any average over different values of @xmath15 , @xmath12 and we instead consider just one linear fit for a given range @xmath10 $ ] . in particular we focus our attention on two ranges , namely @xmath16 $ ] , following the prescription of other works ( @xcite ) , and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the reason for this simplification is that , given a range of @xmath4 , we did not want to weight more the small values with respect to the big values .",
    "this point will be further stressed later in the paper .      as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there is a debate in literature concerning what property of the financial time - series contributes mostly to their observed multiscaling behaviour .",
    "let us here discuss some findings present in the literature . in @xcite",
    "the author studied the dow jones industrial average taken on a daily basis and processed the data in four different ways in order to uncover the source of the multiscaling behaviour .",
    "the methods used were ( @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "shuffling the data in order to check the impact of the shape of the unconditional distribution ; 2 .   building up surrogate data with the same unconditional distribution and linear correlation of the empirical one but with any non linear correlation removed ; 3 .   cutting the tails by substituting the more extreme events with resampled ones from the core of the distribution ; 4 .",
    "generating surrogate power law - tailed time - series , namely double weibull and t - student , preserving the temporal structure of the empirical time - series .",
    "the author found that , on one hand the temporal structure , both linear and non linear , has a minor impact . on the other hand , the fatter the tails are , the stronger the multiscaling . and",
    "this result was confirmed both by cutting the extreme events and changing the unconditional distribution .",
    "in @xcite the authors studied again the dow jones industrial average taken on a daily basis plus the dow jones euro stoxx 50 sampled at one minute . in this case three analysis were performed :    1 .",
    "shuffling the whole dataset ; 2 .   dividing the dataset into intervals and shuffling them in order to keep short memory contributions then repeating the analysis changing the length of the intervals ; 3 .   cutting the extreme events .",
    "the authors found that when shuffled , the dataset loses its multiscaling behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shuffling of the intervals showed that the linearity of the scaling of the fluctuation functions worsen when the length of the interval is small and improves increasing it , thus according to the authors this should be regarded as a sign that the temporal correlations are the source of multiscaling . for what concerns the cut of the most extreme events they found that for the dow jones industrial average extreme events have no particular impact , while for the dow jones euro stoxx 50 they cause a distortion in the singularity spectrum .    finally in @xcite an extensive analysis",
    "was conducted on several empirical time - series including stock market indexes , exchange rates and interest rates . in order to unveil the source of the empirical multiscaling ,",
    "the shuffling method was used plus a comparison with synthetic data .",
    "the authors also found an increase of the measured multiscaling of the shuffled time - series which then led them to draw two conclusions : first that the major source of the multifractality comes from the power law tails of the distribution ; second that the presence of time correlations decreases the multifractality .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the analysis of the markov switching multifractal model ( @xcite ) .",
    "further analyses have been conducted by means of fractional brownian motions , random walks with steps drawn from a levy distribution and arfima processes , all confirming the results found on the empirical datasets ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we describe the analytical properties of the models we used for our analysis and the variable we chose to detect the multifractality .",
    "we considered a uniscaling process with independent increments drawn from a t - student distribution . introducing the dummy variable @xmath18 ,",
    "the probability density of a t - student distribution is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of degrees freedom which can be non - integer .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ t - stud_classic ] ) the variable @xmath18 has mean zero if @xmath21 and infinite otherwise .",
    "the variance is instead equal to @xmath22 if @xmath23 , infinite if @xmath24 and undefined otherwise .",
    "the spectrum of a tbm can be computed analytically in both cases , either if @xmath20 is bigger or smaller then two .",
    "for @xmath25 the t - student distribution of eq .",
    "( [ t - stud_classic ] ) behaves as a stable distribution with skewness parameter equal to zero and stability parameter equal to @xmath20 , so the scaling exponents are ( see @xcite ) to be equal to one .",
    "however , as underlined in @xcite and @xcite , this so called bifractal behaviour is a pure finite size sample effect . ]",
    "@xmath26 for @xmath23 and finite aggregation horizon @xmath4 it can be shown that @xmath27=f(q)\\tau^\\frac{q}{2}.\\ ] ] thus @xmath28 it is expected then that for @xmath23 the scaling exponents are identical to the one of a bm up to @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    ", it can be proved rigorously that the scaling exponents behave like eq .",
    "( [ scaling_t_stud ] ) ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) .    according to these analytical observations a tbm is a unifractal process both for @xmath25 and @xmath31 and @xmath14 behaves as a straight line .      among the models proposed in the literature , in the present paper we chose as a benchmark multifractal model the so - called multifractal random walk introduced in @xcite .",
    "its main appealing property is that it has exactly computable scaling exponents .",
    "we report that this model has been further developed and alternative multifractal random walks models with different scaling exponents has been proposed ( see @xcite ) , however for our purposes the statistical properties of this original model are sufficient . in the discrete version , the process @xmath2 described by the model",
    "is defined as ( @xcite ) @xmath32 so the increments can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is called intermittency parameter , @xmath37 is the autocorrelation length , @xmath38 is the variance of the overall process and @xmath39 is the discretization step ( @xcite ) .",
    "the peculiarity of this model is that , while the @xmath40 are independent , the @xmath41 are not , having autocovariance ( @xcite ) : @xmath42 with @xmath43 the scaling exponents of this model in the continuous limit are ( @xcite ) : @xmath44 the importance of this model relies in the fact that , by means of just three parameters ( @xmath45 ) , it exhibits both power law tails and volatility clustering , keeping its plain innovations uncorrelated .",
    "in particular the intermittency parameter @xmath36 determines both the power law tails , which decay with an exponent proportional to @xmath46 ( @xcite ) , and the decay of the autocorrelation functions of the powers of the absolute returns , whose decaying exponents are again proportional to @xmath46 ( @xcite ) .      in order to understand the behaviour of the scaling exponents @xmath14",
    ", we used the generalized hurst exponent , @xmath5 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ moments_scaling ] ) and ( [ log_moments_scaling2 ] ) ) .",
    "let us note that due to the presence of the power law tails in the empirical datasets ( @xcite ) , the value of @xmath1 should be less then the tail exponent of the analysed time - series , since the moments are not finite for large @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the existence of a moment does not guarantee its measurement on finite samples to be reliable when its variance is not finite . following these observations , along with the fact that the decay exponents of the empirical power law tails typically range between two and five ( @xcite ) , in our analyses we limited ourselves to @xmath47 .",
    "in particular we took a range of @xmath1 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 every @xmath48 units , having @xmath50 points in total . + to assess the presence of a statistically meaningful curvature in the scaling exponents , thus multiscaling , we performed a parabolic fit over the range @xmath47 and then we took the coefficient of the second degree term as a multiscaling estimator , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51 where then @xmath52 is the multifractality estimator we adopted in this paper",
    ". it must have negative ( multiscaling behaviour ) or zero ( uniscaling behaviour ) expectation value ( due to concavity ) .",
    "the expected value of the parameter @xmath53 is zero and in our measurements of @xmath14 we always checked this condition for consistency .",
    "note that in @xcite the authors fit the singularity spectrum , with a fourth degree polynomial which implies necessarily a fourth degree polynomial functional form for @xmath14 .",
    "however , for our purposes , a second degree fit is enough and we verified that the inclusion of the terms up to the fourth degree does not modify our results .",
    "we started our analysis simulating @xmath54 mrw processes , specified in subsec .",
    "[ section_mrw ] , made of @xmath55 steps @xmath56 with parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and computing the mean and the standard deviation of @xmath52 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 over the realizations .",
    "we then repeated the measure over the shuffled version of the time - series .",
    "the convergence of the estimators has been always checked .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath37 have been chosen according to empirical analyses conducted in other works ( see for example @xcite ) , while the length has been chosen to reduce as much as possible the finite size sample errors keeping reasonable computational times .",
    "the results are reported in tabs .",
    "[ plainvsshuffledmrw1 ] and [ plainvsshuffledmrw2 ] with respectively @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the theoretical values are reported in boldface within brackets under the measured values .",
    ".comparison between @xmath52 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for a plain and a shuffled mrw with @xmath16 $ ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe first that the results change considerably .",
    "secondly , within the @xmath62 significance level the shuffled time - series can be considered uniscaling , as it happens for the tbm , so there is not an increase in multifractality .",
    "thirdly the normalized time - series keeps its concavity , thus it is not affected anymore by the negative bias mentioned previously .",
    "this therefore demonstrates that a statistically significant multiscaling behaviour is present in financial time - series .",
    "our analyses provide clear evidence that the estimation of the scaling exponents are affected by the aggregation horizon .",
    "we chose two regions : 1 ) @xmath16 $ ] , which is in line with previous works and 2 ) @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we observed that the analyses on the region @xmath16 $ ] do not reproduce the theoretical expectations on time - series exhibiting power law tails or autocorrelation structures like the empirical ones .",
    "we also found an unexpected concavity of the scaling exponents @xmath14 on tbms and nmrws .",
    "these results are in line with previous observations on real time - series and actually enable us to give them an explanation .",
    "in particular in @xcite the authors argue that the presence of autocorrelations in real data can induce a negative bias in the estimation of the scaling exponents . according to our interpretation ,",
    "the change of concavity of @xmath14 ( reported in tab .",
    "[ indu_test_1_19 ] ) is exactly the effect of the negative bias . in light of this ,",
    "the increased multiscaling behaviour measured in @xcite after shuffling has to be ascribed to the fact that the causal structure of a shuffled time - series is destroyed along with the negative bias itself and only the power law tails effect is left resulting in an apparent increase of multiscaling .    for what concerns the region",
    "@xmath17 $ ] we observed that the spurious multiscaling found on tbm processes and on the indu time - series is lower with respect to the measurements performed in the @xmath16 $ ] region , being even statistically absent for @xmath63 and for the indu as well .",
    "furthermore , the convexity of @xmath14 returns to a concavity , almost removing the negative bias effect .",
    "we conclude therefore that ghe measurements of multifractality in the region @xmath17 $ ] are reliable and reveal that some degree of multifractality is present in real financial log - return time series and it has to be ascribed to the effect of the causal structure of the process .    at this point",
    "a question to address is why there is a so big difference in the two regions of @xmath4 . for what concerns the effect of the tails we explain this difference via the speed of convergence of the central limit theorem ( clt ) . in particular , for processes exhibiting increments with power law tails , with tails index bigger than two , it is well - known that under aggregation they behave , in the asymptotic limit , as a bm .",
    "the speed of convergence depends on how heavy the tails are but if the aggregation is finite , whatever the tails index is , there will always be a region in the final part of the tails of the probability density which will have a power law behaviour .",
    "the effect of increasing the aggregation horizon is to push this region further in the tail .",
    "this explains why , increasing the aggregation horizon , the spurious power law tails concavity tends to disappear , reconciling with the theoretical expectations .",
    "counter - intuitively processes with increments exhibiting tails with exponents less then two are less affected by this problem , since their convergence under aggregation is ruled by a generalized central limit theorem and they keep their power law nature in the tails of the distribution so the convergence is faster .",
    "concerning the autocorrelation negative bias , our interpretation is that it may be caused by the fact that the average of a strongly correlated variable does not necessarily converge to the expectation value . in this respect",
    "the effect might be reduced in the region @xmath17 $ ] because taking bigger aggregation horizon implies averaging over less correlated variables .",
    "+ in light of these results we argue that in order to make a reliable measure of multifractality , regions of @xmath4 with a small aggregation horizon should be taken with care .",
    "let us however stress that the region @xmath17 $ ] has not been chosen optimizing the performance of the multifractal estimator .",
    "however it proved to be sufficient to give us valuable insights and improved our estimation of the scaling parameters .",
    "let us make few other observations concerning the measurements . since the measures , as proposed here ( cfr .",
    "[ subsec_multifractality ] ) , depend on two parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath12 , we report that in general , @xmath15 rules the precision while @xmath12 the accuracy .",
    "so a bigger value of @xmath15 would reflect in measured values nearer to expected ones . on the other hand taking bigger values of @xmath12",
    "ends up in including more oscillating values in the analysis , thus in a larger standard deviation .",
    "however for a process like the mrw , attention must be paid , since , if @xmath15 becomes bigger than the autocorrelation length , no multifractal behaviour holds anymore , since the increments of the process become independent .",
    "so the range of @xmath4 must be taken large enough to reduce as much as possible the power law tails effect , but not too much to exceed the time - span where the correlations are relevant .",
    "finally , we notice that it appears evident that at small ranges of @xmath4 the power law tails concavity has a bigger impact to the measures with respect to the convexity induced by the autocorrelation .",
    "in this paper we studied the multiscaling behaviour of financial time - series by studying synthetic and real datasets at different aggregation horizons .",
    "we started by analysing the mrw , finding that , for small aggregation horizons , the multiscaling behaviour after shuffling , appears to increase , in agreement with previous works on empirical datasets .",
    "however for larger aggregation horizons this effect disappears . since the shuffling procedure destroys the temporal structure of a time - series , but preserves its unconditional distribution , we focused our attention on the scaling properties of another process , the tbm which is a unifractal process .",
    "it turned out that for small aggregation horizons the presence of power law tails induces a concavity in the scaling exponents , indicating therefore a multiscaling behaviour which is however not predicted by the theory .",
    "we turned then our attention to the causal structure of a time - series .",
    "in this case we observed that , at small aggregation horizons , the presence of autocorrelation introduces a negative bias , _ i.e. _ a reduced concavity which ended up in a convexity of the scaling exponents , both for synthetic and real time - series .",
    "these numerical findings explain well the puzzling increase in multifractality found in previous works after shuffling : as long as both power law tails and autocorrelation are kept , the spurious multiscaling contribution of the tails is lessen by the presence of the autocorrelation , while after shuffling , only the tails effect is present .",
    "we pointed out that the aggregation of the returns is crucial . indeed for higher aggregation horizons all these issues disappear or at least strongly lessen . for what concerns the tails we interpret this effect as a consequence of the central limit theorem and its speed of convergence on time - series with power law tails but finite variance .",
    "in particular the range of tail exponents between two and five turned out to affect the most the measurements .",
    "this is due to the fact that under aggregation a residual of the power law tail is always present in the unconditional distribution and the nearer the exponent is to two , the stronger the effect .",
    "we finally note that , choosing higher values of aggregations can reduce this effect but this requires to have longer time - series .",
    "we plan in the future to study in more detail this issue trying to provide a recipe for the best choice of the region of @xmath4 which is capable to capture the multifractality of the empirical time - series .",
