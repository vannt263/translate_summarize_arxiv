    "it is important to stabilize not only individual quantum states , but the entire manifold spanned by their superpositions .",
    "this requires synthesizing artificial interactions with desirable properties which are impossible to find in natural systems .",
    "particularly , in the case of quantum superconducting circuits , josephson junctions together with parametric pumping methods provide powerful hardware elements for the design of such hamiltonians . here",
    "we extend the design toolkit , by using ideas borrowed from raman processes to achieve hamiltonians of high - order nonlinearity .",
    "more precisely , we introduce a novel nonlinear driven - dissipative process stabilizing a four - dimensional degenerate manifold .    in general , a quantum system interacting with its environment will decohere through the entanglement between the environmental and the system degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in certain cases , a driven system with a properly tailored interaction with an environment can remain in a pure excited state or even a manifold of excited states .",
    "the simplest example is a driven harmonic oscillator with an ordinary dissipation , i.e. a frictional force proportional to velocity . in the underdamped quantum regime",
    ", this friction corresponds to the harmonic oscillator undergoing a single - photon loss process .",
    "such a driven - dissipative process , in the rotating frame of the harmonic oscillator , can be modeled by the master equation @xmath0+\\kappa\\mathcal{d}\\left[\\hat{a}\\right]\\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the density operator , @xmath2 is the harmonic oscillator annihilation operator , @xmath3 represents the resonant complex amplitude of the resonant drive , @xmath4 is the dissipation rate of the harmonic oscillator and @xmath5\\rho=\\hat{l}\\rho\\hat{l}^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{l}^\\dagger \\hat{l } \\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho \\hat{l}^\\dagger \\hat{l}\\ ] ] is the lindblad super - operator .",

    "note also that the right - hand side of the above master equation can be simply written as @xmath8\\rho$ ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 is the steady state of the process follows from @xmath9 .",
    "this idea can be generalized to a non - linear dissipation of the form @xmath10\\rho$ ] which admits as steady states the @xmath11 coherent states @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , all these coherent states and their superpositions are in the kernel of the dissipation operator @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , this process stabilizes the whole @xmath11-dimensional manifold spanned by the above coherent states .",
    "the case with @xmath14 has been proposed in  @xcite and experimentally realized in  @xcite .",
    "the idea consists of mediating a coupling between a high - q cavity mode ( resonance frequency @xmath15 ) and a low - q resonator ( resonance frequency @xmath16 ) through a josephson junction . applying a strong microwave drive at frequency @xmath17 and a weaker drive at frequency @xmath16",

    "here we go beyond this by exploring a scheme which enables non - linear dissipations of higher - order .",
    "more precisely , we propose a method to achieve a four - photon interaction hamiltonian without significantly increasing the required hardware complexity .",
    "the idea consists of using a raman - type process  @xcite , exploiting virtual transitions , to cascade two @xmath24 interactions .",
    "an important application of such a manifold stabilization is error - protected quantum information encoding and processing .",
    "as suggested in  @xcite , a four - photon driven - dissipative process enables a protected encoding of quantum information in two steady states of the same photon - number parity .",
    "continuous monitoring of the photon - number parity observable then enables a protection against the dominant decay channel of the harmonic oscillator corresponding to the natural single - photon loss  @xcite .",

    ", we study the dynamics in presence of dissipation of the low - q mode along with possible improvements . in the appendices  [ appendix : rwa_with_dissipation ] and  [ appendix : optimizing_gamma ] we discuss the derivation of the effective master equation and the accuracy of approximations used in the analytical calculations .",
    "similar to the ideas presented in the last section , in order to have four - photon dissipation , we need to build a process that exchanges four cavity - photons with an excitation in a dissipative mode .",
    "following the example of the two photon process , this could be realized by engineering an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath25 which is exchanging four photons of the cavity mode with a single excitation of the low - q mode .",
    "we need the strength of the interaction @xmath26 to significantly exceed the decay rate of the storage cavity mode @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian of a josephson junction provides us with a six - wave mixing process which combined with an off - resonant pump at frequency @xmath28 could in principle produce such an interaction .",
    "however , this six - wave mixing process comes along with other nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian which could be of the same or higher magnitude .",
    "in particular , as it has been explained in  @xcite , with the currently achievable experimental parameters , the cavity self - kerr effect would be at least an order of magnitude larger than @xmath26 .",
    "reference  @xcite proposes a more elaborate josephson circuit to realize a purer interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this , however , comes at the expense of significant hardware development and might encounter other unknown experimental limitations . here",
    "we propose an alternative approach , which is based on cascading two - photon exchange processes .",
    "this leads to significant hardware simplifications and could in principle be realized with current experimental setups  @xcite . in the next subsection",
    ", we give a schematic representation of the proposed protocol , which uses higher energy levels of the junction mode and a cascading based on raman transition  @xcite . in subsection",
    "[ sec : rwa_without_dissipation ] we sketch a mathematical analysis based on the second order rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "this is supplemented by numerical simulations comparing the exact and the approximate hamiltonians .      in order to combine a pair of two - photon exchange processes , we take advantage of the junction mode being a multilevel anharmonic system . the basic principle of our scheme",

    "more precisely , we exchange four cavity photons with two excitations of the junction mode .",
    "this could be done in a sequential manner by exchanging , twice , two cavity photons with an excitation of the junction mode , once from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and then from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . however , as will be seen later , populating the @xmath30 level of the junction mode leads to undesired decoherence channels for the cavity mode .",
    "therefore we perform this cascading using a virtual transition through the @xmath30 level by detuning the two - photon exchange pumps .",
    "this is similar to a raman transition in a three level system .",

    "[ fig : basic_principle_b ] ) . as we will see in section  [ sec : including_dissipation ] , in order to achieve four - photon dissipation , we also require the junction mode to dissipate from the @xmath31 to the @xmath29 state .",
