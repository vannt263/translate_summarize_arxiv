    "<S> recent experiments have demonstrated that dynein motor exhibits _ catch bonding _ behaviour , in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with increasing force , for a certain range of force . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these experiments , we propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond deformation ( tfbd ) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical applied load force . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional transport properties of cellular cargo carried by _ multiple _ </S>",
    "<S> dynein motors within the framework of this model . </S>",
    "<S> we find catch bonding can result in dramatic changes in the transport properties , which are in sharp contrast to kinesin driven unidirectional transport , where catch bonding is absent . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that , under certain conditions , the average velocity of the cellular cargo can actually increase as applied load is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the transport properties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor . </S>",
    "<S> this phase plot yields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable modifications of motor transport and binding properties . </S>",
    "<S> our work necessitates a reexamination of existing theories of collective bidirectional transport of cellular cargo where the catch bond effect of dynein described in this letter is expected to play a crucial role .    </S>",
    "<S> motor protein driven transport of cellular cargoes along polar microtubule ( mt ) filaments is one of the principal mechanisms by which active long distance transport is achieved within an eukaryotic cell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism plays a vital role in keeping the cell spatially organized and maintaining the uneven distributions of the various cellular components@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while single motor properties has been extensively studied , both in experiments and theory @xcite , a large class of cooperative transport processes depends critically on the interaction of various motors and their collective behaviour , which can give rise to a whole new class of emergent phenomena @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of this cooperative transport , however , remains an important open question . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have revealed that unidirectional transport of cellular cargo involves teamwork of motor proteins of a single type , e.g ; kinesin , dynein and myosin family of motors , while bidirectional transport requires team of oppositely directed kinesin and dynein motors @xcite . while molecular architecture and transport properties of these different classes of motors are significantly diverse and different , existing theoretical studies , have used the kinesin motor as a paradigm for motor - driven transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the single motor unbinding rate is modeled as an exponentially increasing function of force ( slip - bond ) for both plus - end and minus - end directed motors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent experiments have shown that dynein unlike kinesin , exhibits _ </S>",
    "<S> catch bond _ </S>",
    "<S> behaviour , where beyond a certain threshold force , the detachment rate of a single dynein from mt filament decreases with increasing load force @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> catch bond behaviour @xcite has been observed in various biological protein receptor - ligand complexes , such as the complex of leukocyte adhesion molecule p - selectin with the ligand psgl-1 @xcite and actin / myosin complex @xcite as well as microtubule - kinetochore attachments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different mechanisms have been proposed for the catch bond such as the two - state two - pathway model @xcite , the one - state two - pathway model @xcite and the bond deformation model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the one - state two - pathway model provides two dissociation pathways , a catch barrier which increases with force , and a slip barrier which decreases with force . </S>",
    "<S> if the catch barrier is initially lower than the slip barrier , the system demonstrates a catch - slip transition with increasing force . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation model , on the other hand , proposes that force alters the conformation space in a fashion that strengthens receptor - ligand binding , and hence decreases the detachment rate . if the minimum of the potential decreases faster with force than the height of the barrier , one again obtains a catch - slip behaviour @xcite .    in this work , motivated by recent experimental and simulation studies of dynein structure , we focus on the deformation model of catch bonds . </S>",
    "<S> cytoplasmic dynein has two heads that walk processively along the microtubule stalk in discrete steps . </S>",
    "<S> each head has a globular region consisting of six aaa domains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this globular region has two elongated structures emerging from it , the stalk , which binds to the microtubule , and the stem , which binds to the cargo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that the globular head region contracts under applied load , which in turn causes tension to develop along the mt - binding stalk @xcite . beyond a certain critical load </S>",
    "<S> , this can lead to allosteric deformations in the receptor region of the dynein stalk and the ligand domain on the mt surface which lock them together ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic ] ) , resulting in a catch bond @xcite . at low / intermediate loads , </S>",
    "<S> the catch bond can not be activated and differential stepping is required to advance against load @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct experimental evidence comes from recent in - vitro experiments on single - molecule dynein detachment kinetics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detachment rate of a dynein motor is found to initially increase , and then decrease with force beyond a critical threshold . at extremely large forces </S>",
    "<S> , we should eventually regain a slip bond , thus exhibiting a slip - catch - clip behaviour over the entire force range . </S>",
    "<S> this we model through a threshold force bond deformation ( tfbd ) model , where the deformation pathway activates beyond a certain threshold force .    </S>",
    "<S> * model : * we consider a cargo which is transported on a filament by @xmath0 dynein motors against a constant external load force @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the cargo is characterized by the number of bound motors @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> motors are irreversibly attached to the cargo but undergo attachment ( detachment ) to ( from ) the filament . with @xmath2 bound motors , </S>",
    "<S> the rates of attachment and detachment are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the load force is assumed to be shared equally by the @xmath2 bound motors @xcite , so that each motor experiences a force @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the attachment / detachment process is given by the temporal evolution of the probability @xmath7 of having @xmath2 bound motors , expressed as the one - step master equation , @xmath8 the corresponding master equation for the unbound vesicle @xmath9 is , @xmath10 , while for vesicle with @xmath0 bound motors , it is @xmath11 .        </S>",
    "<S> the bond deformation model proposes that catch bond behavior occurs by lowering the bound state due to force induced deformation of the bond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation energy is given by , @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 characterizes the strength of the deformation energy and @xmath14 sets a force scale .    </S>",
    "<S> since _ in - vitro _ dynein exhibits catch bond behaviour above a threshold force @xmath15 , and the load force @xmath1 is shared between @xmath2 motors , we introduce the threshold force bond deformation ( tfbd ) model with the deformation energy now given by , @xmath16,\\ ] ] and the unbinding rate of the cargo carried with @xmath2 attached motors attached to filaments is @xmath17 \\label{eq : tfbd}\\ ] ] where the second term represents the usual slip contribution which exponentially grows with applied load . </S>",
    "<S> this tfbd model exhibits a _ </S>",
    "<S> slip - catch - slip _ </S>",
    "<S> behavior for a single motor unbinding rate as a function of applied force on the motor . in a more general context </S>",
    "<S> , we also study the bond deformation ( bd ) model , by setting @xmath18 to zero in eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ eq : tfbd ] ) .    a cargo which is bound by @xmath2 motors moves with a velocity @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing load force , the velocity of the cargo is expected to decrease until it comes to a rest at some critical stall force @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease is approximately linear , as has been measured for kinesin @xcite and cytoplasmic dynein @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is modelled by the following force velocity relation @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the zero - force velocity for @xmath2 bound motors which is assumed to be independent of the number of bound motors . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state solutions to the master equation yield the probabilities for the unbound and the various bound motor states . </S>",
    "<S> the different transport properties are obtained after normalizing the probabilities with respect to the bound motor states alone @xcite .     for the ( a ) tfbd and ( b ) bd model . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the zero force case ( green crosses ) , where the probability distribution is peaked at zero bound motors and then decreases monotonically , for finite forces , both the tfbd and the bd model show a non - monotonic probability distribution , with the distribution peaking at larger @xmath23 in the bd case . </S>",
    "<S> panels ( c ) and ( d ) shows the effective unbinding rate and the average number of bound motors as a function of force for a slip bond ( solid blue line ) , as opposed to the tfbd ( green dashed curve ) and the bd model ( red dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> data is for @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> * results : * having described the model , we first fit the experimental data @xcite of unbinding rate of single dynein from the mt filament with our proposed tfbd model . </S>",
    "<S> this model is able to capture the essential functional behaviour of unbinding rate of a single dynein as function of applied load force that has been observed in experiments , where the unbinding rate is seen to initially increase with increasing load starting with zero load , and subsequently decrease with increasing load beyond stall force @xmath20 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tfbd](a ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we predict that the single motor unbinding rates should eventually increase with increased load force for forces higher than those accessed in this set of experimental studies </S>",
    "<S> . next we study how the catch bonding behaviour exhibited by single dynein for unidirectional transport affects the steady state transport properties of cellular cargo that is being transported by _ multiple </S>",
    "<S> _ dynein motors . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a cellular cargo being carried by 5 dynein motors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the set of fitted model parameter values of the aforementioned experiment , to find the functional behaviour of various transport properties as a function of applied load force @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tfbd](b ) shows the effective unbinding rate of the cargo from the mt filament increases initially and then it decreases for forces upto about 10 @xmath30 , following which it again starts increasing with increasing load force . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tfbd](c ) shows that the average number of attached motors also increases after an initial dip and finally for forces large than about 20 pn , the average number of attached motors decreases , and exponentially approaches 1 . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tfbd](d ) shows that the mean velocity of the cargo decreases monotonically with increasing load in this parameter regime .     </S>",
    "<S> ( solid blue curve ) and @xmath31 ( dashed red curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve shows four velocity humps which reduces to a single - hump velocity profile on increasing @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) bd model for @xmath33 ( solid blue curve ) and @xmath29 ( dashed red curve ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , a four - hump profile reduces to a monotonically decreasing velocity profile on increasing @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> data is for @xmath34 motors with @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath35@xcite , @xmath36 and @xmath25 . ]    experimentally , it is known that the various motor properties can vary significantly for different classes of dynein motors . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , _ weak _ dynein is known to have a stall force of @xmath37 while for _ strong _ dynein @xmath38@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we next explore the different _ plausible _ scenarios resulting from the ramifications of generic catch bond behaviour observed not only for dynein motors but also for myosin motors @xcite by studying the transport properties both for the tfbd model as well as the bond deformation ( bd ) model , by setting @xmath18 to zero in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : tfbd ] . </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus on the variation of the transport properties resulting from changes in stall force @xmath20 , binding rates @xmath32 and catch bond strength @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the catch bonding on the probability distribution of @xmath23 bound motor state @xmath39 is to shift the peak value of the distribution towards higher number of bound motors for certain range of forces both for the tfbd model ( fig .  [ fig : prob - eps - n]a ) and the bd model ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob - eps - n]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shift results from the fact that when a larger number of motors is bound to the filament , the force on each motor is low enough that they are in the _ catch _ regime , resulting in a decrease of propensity of individual motors to detach from filament in this state and hence a consequent increase in the probability of the states with higher number of attached motors . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when fewer number of motors bind to the filament , the load on each motor is higher , so that motors in this state are more likely to detach , and hence have a lower probability . </S>",
    "<S> this shifting of peak of the probability distribution towards higher @xmath23 states manifests as an increase in the average number of bound motors and a decrease in effective unbinding rates for certain range of forces for both tfbd and bd model . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob - eps - n](c ) and  [ fig : prob - eps - n](d ) and the behaviour contrasts with the case of slip bonds where the effective unbinding rate monotonically increases and the average number of bound motors monotonically decreases with increasing load . </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the mean velocity profile of the cargo as a function of load force . </S>",
    "<S> catch bond behaviour manifests in rather remarkable behaviour for the velocity profile of the cargo - the mean velocity of the cargo can actually increase with increase in opposing load force for certain range of @xmath20 , the strength of catch bond @xmath13 and binding rate @xmath32 for both the tfbd and bd model ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : velocity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this unique behaviour can be understood as a direct consequence of the catch bond effect , which tends to stabilize the bound motor states with higher attached motors which move with a higher velocity so that the average velocity of the cargo actually increases .     </S>",
    "<S> plane for the tfbd model with @xmath40 ( a ) @xmath41 , ( b ) @xmath42 , and for the bd model with @xmath40 ( a ) @xmath43 , ( b ) @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the violet region corresponds to a monotonically decreasing force velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> the red , green blue and yellow regions corresponds to velocity profiles with one , two , three and four humps respectively ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : velocity ] for examples of individual velocity profiles ) . </S>",
    "<S> parameter values are the same as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : velocity ] . </S>",
    "<S> stall forces is in pns . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is in in units of @xmath44 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we systematically study the effect of variation of the stall force @xmath20 and @xmath13 by constructing a velocity profile phase diagram with different regions characterised by the number of maxima of mean velocity in the force - velocity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phaseplot ] shows the resulting phase diagrams for two different @xmath32 values each for the tfbd ( [ fig : phaseplot](a ) [ fig : phaseplot](b ) ) and the bd ( [ fig : phaseplot](c ) [ fig : phaseplot](d ) ) models . </S>",
    "<S> the different regions in the phase diagram corresponds to different velocity - force profiles having maximas ranging from zero to 4 ( for n = 5 ) . for sufficiently weak catch bond strength @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> the force - velocity profiles is such that the mean velocity always decreases for increasing load force , similar to the behaviour in the absence of catch bond . </S>",
    "<S> however for both tfbd and bd model , increasing @xmath13 and lowering @xmath20 have the effect of modifying the velocity - force profiles in a manner that they have one or more maxima of the mean velocity as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phaseplot ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space explored is a plausible biological regime and in principal should be observable by suitable biochemical means which can alter and/or the stall forces , the catch bond strength and binding rates of the motors to the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the tfbd model proposed in this letter captures the experimental results for dynein driven cargo transport . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to canonical slip - bond models , the tfbd model for the catch bond has non - trivial consequences for the transport properties , in particular for the velocity profiles in response to applied loads , which should in principle be observable in experiments , and hence provides a testable prediction for our model . </S>",
    "<S> the more generic bd model also has similar dramatic differences in the transport properties that might be relevant for other motor driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> this work necessitates a reexamination of existing models of cellular cargo transport to take into account the catch bond mechanism described here . in particular , cooperative bi - directional cargo transport through the simultaneous action of oppositely directed motors ( with one or both types of motors having a catch bond ) </S>",
    "<S> is expected to have significantly different characteristics as compared to those described by existing theories , and will be discussed in a forthcoming publication . </S>"
