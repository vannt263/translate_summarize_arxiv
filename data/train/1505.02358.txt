    "active sequential hypothesis testing ( asht ) is a generalization of the classical sequential hypothesis testing problem where , at each observation instant , the decision maker has a choice that controls the type or quality of the observation . for example , in a cognitive radio setting , at each observation instant , the decision maker must select exactly one frequency band , of the several available , for observation .",
    "another example is visual search where , at each time instant , one can focus only on a small subset of the entire visual field , and one must choose this subset for information gathering .",
    "asht can be used as a modeling tool for many other applications apart from visual search and cognitive radio , such as anomaly detection , medical diagnostics , etc .",
    "chernoff @xcite studied asht in the context of designing optimal experiments .",
    "his performance metric was the total cost of sampling , which is propotional to delay , plus a penalty for false detection .",
    "chernoff proposed a policy , the so - called _ procedure a _ , and showed its asymptotic optimality as the cost of sampling went to zero . _",
    "procedure a _ maintains a posterior distribution on the set of hypotheses and , at each instant , selects actions according to the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability .",
    "in this paper we study a further extension of asht where , in addition to the average decision delay , we also penalize switching of actions",
    ". the current extension is motivated by visual search where a switch in action implies a change in the location of one s focus and a fast movement of the eyes ( a saccade ) , which has an associated biological cost that translates to a delay cost .",
    "we propose a modified _ procedure a _ where the next action depends on the current posterior and the previous action , whereas in _ procedure a _ the next action depends only on the current posterior .",
    "the modification is simple : at a given decision instant , if an independently generated bernoulli random variable turns up `` @xmath0 '' , then the next action is taken as per _ procedure a _ , else the current action is continued .",
    "we call this the _ sluggish procedure a_.    there has been a flurry of recent activity extending chernoff s work in other directions . in a series of works ,",
    "naghshvar and javidi @xcite studied asht from a bayesian cost minimization perspective .",
    "the total cost was the sum of decision delay and a penalty for false detection .",
    "they proposed policies , similar to chernoff s _ procedure a _ , identified bounds on the total cost , and established their proposed policies asymptotic optimality in the same asymptotic regime as chernoff s .",
    "nitinawarat et al .",
    "@xcite studied active hypothesis testing in fixed sample size and in sequential settings .",
    "they also minimize decision delay subject to a constraint on the conditional probability of false detection .",
    "when these conditional probabilities of false detection are driven to zero , the resulting asymptotic regime is the same as chernoff s . in this asymptotic regime , they obtained results similar to those of chernoff s but under milder assumptions .",
    "they also prove a stronger asymptotic result based on the `` risk associated with a decision '' .",
    "nitinawarat and veeravalli @xcite extended asht to markovian observations and non - uniform costs on actions .",
    "recently cohen and zhao @xcite studied asht from an anomaly detection perspective .",
    "they showed that , in their setting , a simple deterministic policy was optimal .",
    "this is in contrast to random policies advocated in the other works .",
    "none of the above works consider costs associated with a change in action .",
    "[ [ our - contribution ] ] our contribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we show that the aforementioned modification of chernoff s _ procedure a _ , the _ sluggish procedure a _ , is asymptotically optimal even with switching costs .",
    "further , we show that the growth rate of the total cost , as the probability of false detection is driven to zero , and as a switching parameter of the _ sluggish procedure a _ is driven to zero , is the same as that without switching costs .",
