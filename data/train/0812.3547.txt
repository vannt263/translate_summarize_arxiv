    "in the last few years the scattering of nucleons by deuterons has been the subject of a large number of investigations .",
    "this scattering problem is in fact a very useful tool for testing the accuracy of our present knowledge of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) and three nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .",
    "noticeable progress has been achieved , but a number of relevant disagreements between theoretical predictions and experimental results still remains to be solved  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to extend the above mentioned analysis to four nucleon scattering processes . in this case , an important goal for both theoretical and experimental analysis is to reach a precision comparable to that achieved in the @xmath1 case .",
    "this is particularly challenging from the theoretical point of view , since the study of @xmath2 systems is noticeably more complicated than the @xmath3 one .",
    "recently , accurate calculations of four - body scattering observables have been achieved in the framework of the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations  @xcite , solved in momentum space , and treating the long - range coulomb interaction using the screening - renormalization method  @xcite .    in this contribution , the four - body scattering problem is solved using the kohn variational method and expanding the internal part of the wave function in terms of the hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) functions .",
    "previous applications of this method  @xcite were limited so far to consider only local potentials , as the argonne v18  @xcite nn potential .",
    "recently , for bound - states , the hh method has been extended to treat also non - local potentials , given either in coordinate- or momentum - space  @xcite . here , we report the first application of the hh method to the four - body scattering problem with non - local potentials .",
    "the potential used in this paper is the n3lo - idaho model by entem & machleidt  @xcite , with cutoff @xmath4 mev .",
    "this potential has been derived using an effective field theory approach and the chiral perturbation theory up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "we have also performed calculations by adding to the n3lo - idaho potential a 3n interaction , derived at next - to - next - to leading order ( n2lo ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ( n3lo - idaho / n2lo interaction model ) .",
    "the two free parameters in this n2lo 3n potential have been chosen from the combination that reproduces the @xmath5 binding energies  @xcite .",
    "the development of a 3n interaction including n3lo contribution is still under progress  @xcite .",
    ".[table : comp ] phase - shift and mixing angle parameters for @xmath0 elastic scattering at incident neutron energy @xmath6 mev calculated using the n3lo - idaho potential .",
    "the values reported in the columns labeled hh have been obtained using the hh expansion and the kohn variational principle , whereas those reported in the columns labeled fy by solving the fy equations  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : comp ] , a comparison between hh and fy calculations is reported .",

    "the values reported in the columns labeled hh have been obtained using the hh expansion and the kohn variational principle , whereas those reported in the columns labeled fy by solving the fy equations  @xcite . as can be seen",

    "@xcite.,height=302 ]    the preliminary results for the @xmath0 total cross section calculated with the considered potential models are reported in figure  [ fig : tcs ] . as already known , the calculated cross section with the av18 potential overpredicts the experimental data at low energies , and is well under the data in the peak region  @xcite . the problem at low energies is cured when the urbana - ix 3n force  @xcite is considered  @xcite . in the peak region",
    "the inclusion of this 3n force slightly decreases the cross section , increasing the disagreement with the data . on the other hands , using the n3lo - idaho a better agreement with experimental data is found  @xcite . including the n2lo 3n force , there is now a perfect agreement at low energy ( in particular , in the minimum around @xmath8 mev ) . also in the peak region a slight better agreement is observed .",
    "the origin of the remaining discrepancy is unclear , but it could be related to parts of 3n interaction not yet considered .",
