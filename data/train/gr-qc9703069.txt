    "it is believed that quantum effects played a fundamental role in the early universe .",
    "for instance , vacuum polarisation and particle production arise from a quantum description of matter . however it is known that both of them can be modeled in terms of a classical bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "other processes capable of producing important dissipative stresses include interactions between matter and radiation @xcite , quarks and gluons @xcite , different components of dark matter @xcite , and those mediated by massive particles .",
    "it happens also due to the decay of massive superstrings modes @xcite , gravitational string production @xcite @xcite and phase transitions .",
    "cosmological models with a viscous fluid have been studied by several authors .",
    "some of the interesting subjects addressed by them were the effects of viscous stresses on the avoidance of the initial singularity @xcite , the dissipation of a primordial anisotropy @xcite , the production of entropy @xcite , inflation and deflation @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a homogeneous isotropic spatially - flat universe filled with a causal viscous fluid , whose bulk viscosity coefficient is related to the energy density by the power law @xmath3 , and a truncated version of the transport equation for the viscous pressure , has been investigated thoroughly @xcite @xcite @xcite . this model was based in the relativistic second - order theory of non - equilibrium thermodynamics developed by israel and steward @xcite .",
    "their formulation employs fiducial local equilibrium magnitudes like thermodynamical pressure and temperature , related by an equilibrium gibbs equation , but generalizes the expression of the entropy flux by the inclusion of quadratic terms in dissipative non - equilibrium magnitudes like bulk - viscosity pressure and heat flux .",
    "an alternative formulation of this theory , called extended irreversible thermodynamics has been made by pavn , jou and co - workers @xcite @xcite . here",
    ", non - equilibrium magnitudes like temperature and pressure are introduced instead , and a generalized gibbs equation including the dissipative magnitudes is employed .",
    "the equivalence between both formalisms up to second - order departure from equilibrium has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the truncated version of the transport equation leads to pathological behaviour in the late universe , as the thermodynamical temperature increases with the expansion , leading to an unphysical heating of the universe @xcite .",
    "then , some authors have begun to employ the full version of the transport equation for the bulk viscous pressure , and made comparisons with the results obtained with the truncated one @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one important issue that arises in this context is the choice of the equations of state . for a dissipative boltzmann gas",
    "it was shown that inflationary solutions appear not to arise , and it was conjectured that the inflationary solutions of the truncated causal theory are spurious and an artificial consequence of truncation @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have adopted also the full version of the transport equation but we have taken the simple forms of the equations of state used in @xcite and @xcite , and we have classified the possible behaviors near a singularity . in the present paper",
    "we complete the analysis of this cosmological model .",
    "we present the set of equations that describe the model in section [ s2 ] . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we solve them when @xmath0 and give a detailed analysis of their solutions , including an analysis of the energy conditions @xcite . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we study of stability of those asymptotic solutions that appear for @xmath4 in the truncated causal and noncausal theories by means of the lyapunov method .",
    "the conclusions are stated in section [ s6 ] .",
    "in the case of the homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat robertson - walker metric    @xmath5    only the bulk viscosity needs to be considered .",
    "thus we replace in the einstein equations the equilibrium pressure @xmath6 by an effective pressure @xcite    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9= @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the energy density , @xmath13 is the viscous pressure , and we use units @xmath14 . as equation of state",
    "we take    @xmath15    with a constant adiabatic index @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 we assume the transport equation ,    @xmath18    which arises from the causal irreversible thermodynamics theory , as the simplest way ( linear in @xmath19 ) to guarantee positive entropy production @xcite @xcite . here @xmath20 is the bulk viscous coefficient , and following @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants . also , @xmath24 is the bulk relaxation time and we choose the law    @xmath25    which ensures causal propagation of viscous signals @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath26 is the equilibrium temperature and following @xcite we choose    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants , which is the simplest way to guarantee a positive heat capacity . in the context of standard irreversible thermodynamics , @xmath6 , @xmath30 , @xmath26 and",
    "the number density @xmath31 are equilibrium magnitudes , which are related by equations of state of the form @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "further the thermodynamic relation holds @xcite    @xmath34    which follows from the requirement that the entropy is a state function . in our model , this relation imposes the constrain    @xmath35    so that @xmath36 for @xmath37 . using ( [ 2])-([6 ] )",

    "it is easy to check that solutions of ( [ 9 ] ) never change sign , and we will consider in the following only expanding evolutions , that is @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath61 , that is isothermal matter , it is easy to verify that ( [ 12 ] ) is also the general solution . the constrain ( [ 7 ] ) implies that    @xmath62    where @xmath63 $ ] are real , and @xmath64 are arbitrary integration constants . when any one of them vanishes , we obtain the one - parameter families of solutions , which have explicit form :    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67^{1/2}\\right\\}\\qquad \\nu _ 0=\\frac{1-r}{a}\\ ] ]    and @xmath68 is an arbitrary positive constant . as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the behavior of @xmath71 is friedmann . on the other hand , the de sitter behavior for @xmath72 has already been considered in @xcite @xcite .",

    "depending on the case , the behavior of @xmath76 for small or large time is given by the behavior of @xmath77 near a zero point or for @xmath78 .",

    "thus , we obtain the following classification of the two - parameter families of solutions :    * a. * the evolution begins at a singularity with a friedmann leading behavior as ( [ 10a]+ ) for @xmath87 or ( [ 10b]+ ) for @xmath72 , and so there are particle horizons .",
    "then the scale factor expands with an asymptotically minkowski behavior for large time like ( [ 15 ] ) .",

    "asymptotically de sitter , as ( [ 10b] ) for @xmath72 ;    \\3 .",
    "divergent at finite time , with leading behavior ( [ 10a] ) for @xmath89 .",
    "* c. * the evolution begins at a singularity with a friedmann leading behavior as ( [ 10a]+ ) for @xmath87 or ( [ 10b]+ ) for @xmath72 ; and so there are particle horizons .",
    "then the scale factor expands , and its behavior in the future is like b.      let us consider whether this viscous fluid obeys the energy conditions when @xmath0 @xcite . using ( [ 2])([3 ] ) , the dominant energy condition ( dec ) @xmath90 implies @xmath91 , while the strong energy condition ( sec ) @xmath92 implies @xmath93 .",
    "we find that dec is violated part of the time in the following families : b1 , in the far past as well as for large times ( if @xmath94 ) ; near the singularity in c1 , c2 and c3 ; c3 , near the `` explosion '' .",

    "thus , we find that all these two - parameter solutions violate the energy conditions sometime .",
    "we will make use of the method of the lyapunov function @xcite to investigate the asymptotically stability of the de sitter and asymptotically friedmann solutions that occur in the noncausal and truncated causal models .",

    "we have improved our previous analysis of a cosmological model with a causal viscous fluid by considering the full transport equation for the bulk viscosity instead of the truncated one @xcite .",
    "we have kept the equation of state that relates the equilibrium pressure and energy density , and we have added a power - law relationship between the equilibrium temperature and energy density .",
    "when @xmath0 , the splitting of the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions in terms of sgn@xmath141 follows closely that of the truncated model in terms of sgn @xmath142 ) , which in its turn resembles the classification for the noncausal solutions .",
    "however , families of solutions with extrema no longer remain in the full case , and we find instead asymptotically minkowski evolutions .",
    "moreover , all solutions are monotonic .",
    "the singular behavior for @xmath0 is also very similar to that of the truncated model because , excluding ( [ 10a] ) , singular solutions have particle horizons .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath143 in ( [ 10c]+ ) is smaller than the corresponding magnitude in @xcite .",
    "similar result has already been verified for @xmath111 @xcite .    as in the truncated model , we demonstrate that there is no value of @xmath23 for which there is a stable expanding de sitter period in the far past .",
    "this further support the conclusion of that causality avoids the deflationary behavior proposed by barrow @xcite .    if @xmath110 , a stable exponential inflationary phase occurs in the far future for @xmath144 ; the condition @xmath72 is required if @xmath0 , and such a behavior is unstable for @xmath111 .",
    "this is the same structural behavior already found in the causal truncated and noncausal models .",
    "it has been noted however that the inflation rate in the full causal theory is different , lower for @xmath110 and greater for @xmath111 . also , there is no stiff - fluid viscous exponential inflation , unlike in the truncated or non - causal theories @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that viscosity - driven exponential inflationary solutions are spurious and an artificial consequence of use of causal truncated or noncausal theories @xcite .",
    "this suggestion arises from study of a cosmological model containing a dissipative boltzmann gas .",
    "our results show however that this kind of conclusions does not generalize to other models where the viscous fluid is described by a different equation of state .",
    "moreover , they rather suggest that some features of the solutions , like their asymptotic behavior depend more strongly on the equation of state than on the thermodynamical theory employed .",
    "if @xmath111 , we find that the perfect fluid behavior @xmath140 for @xmath145 is asymptotically stable .",
    "this arises because the viscous pressure decays faster than the thermodynamical pressure .",
    "however , if @xmath0 and @xmath88 , both pressures decay asymptotically as @xmath146 and the exponent becomes @xmath147 .",
    "the perfect fluid behavior becomes unstable if @xmath110 . here also , no structural change occurs with respect to the truncated causal or noncausal models .",
    "the equation ( [ 9 ] ) has a two - dimensional lie group of point symmetries , whose generators are @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we look for a simple transformation to a new dependent variable @xmath150 that is linear in @xmath151 , preserves this group of symmetries and keeps the order of the differential equation .",
    "this technique can be extended to some polynomial autonomous differential equations arising when we consider quantum effects due to vacuum polarisation terms @xcite .",
    "thus , we are led to the transformation                            where @xmath168 and @xmath86 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "we note that , using ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ a1 ] ) becomes a curve on the parameter plane @xmath169 .",
