    "shape phase transitions between different dynamical symmetries became a more interesting topic since the introduction of critical point symmetries @xcite which allowed a parameter free description not only of the extremes but also of their critical point .",
    "however these are not true dynamical symmetries in the sense of group reduction defined in the framework of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , but fitting descriptions provided by similarly simple shapes of the potential surface in the collective geometrical model @xcite .",
    "presently there are known two such critical symmetries , associated to the phase transitions from the spherical vibrator shape phase described by the @xmath4 @xcite dynamical symmetry to the @xmath5 @xcite dynamical symmetry characterizing the @xmath0-unstable nuclei and respectively to the @xmath6 dynamical symmetry of axial rotors .",
    "iachello realized that the critical point potential for both transitions can be fairly well approximated by a square well potential , the resulted models being called @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite respectively . however a consistent algebraic treatment of the most general ( up to two - body terms ) ibm hamiltonian at the critical point of the @xmath9 transition showed results equivalent to those obtained in the geometric model with a pure quartic oscillator potential in @xmath1 shape variable identified as @xmath7-@xmath10 model @xcite .",
    "this particular transition have a special allure due to the exact separation of the shape variables which is not found in the other transition and consequently in the @xmath8 model .    imposing a certain value for the @xmath0 shape variable ,",
    "one reaches the @xmath0-rigid version of the collective model which is interesting by itself due to its description of the basic rotation - vibration coupling @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-rigid version of the critical symmetry @xmath8 , called @xmath2 was proposed not long ago @xcite , revealing a similarity in the @xmath1 excited bands between the two model predictions and which is based on the exact separation of shape and angular variables .",
    "given the openness of the question regarding the shape of the critical point potential , it is then interesting to study the @xmath0-rigid realization of the general quartic oscillator potential with an emphasis on the pure quartic oscillator , and compare it to the models defined in the same space of variables , i.e. @xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath3 .",
    "it must be mentioned that such a program was never realized primarily due to the fact that quartic oscillator schrdinger equation can not be analytically solved , and the existing predictions of models involving mainly the pure quartic oscillator potential are based on numerical integration .",
    "the study of the solutions corresponding to the quartic oscillator potential is very important enforced also by the fact that the next leading anharmonic term of the @xmath1 potential is @xmath10 not only in the @xmath0-rigid case , but also in the @xmath0 stable and unstable models , with the potential separation approximation @xcite in the former case .",
    "the next order anharmonic term lead to a sextic potential which allows a nonvanishing minimum , being thus suitable for the description of deformed nuclei @xcite and even of the candidates for the @xmath8 critical point symmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the differential equation for @xmath1 with sextic potential is quasi - exactly solvable .",
    "it is worth to mention that treating semiclassically a second @xcite , fourth @xcite and sixth @xcite order quadrupole boson hamiltonian leads to a schrdinger equation with a harmonic oscillator , quartic and respectively sextic potentials in a radial - like variable with a centrifugal barrier .    in this paper one investigates the @xmath0-rigid problem for a general quartic anharmonic oscillator potential ( qaop ) , i.e. with both quadratic and quartic terms , by using an analytical formula for the energies of the ground and @xmath1 excited bands . due to the scaling property of the qaop , the energies are function only on one parameter up to an overall multiplying factor , even though the potential is defined by two parameters .",
    "the applicability of the energy formula is studied with regard to the allowed values for the ratio between the first two excited states @xmath11 taking also into account the validity of the adopted approximation .",
    "theoretical calculations are carried out for nine nuclei exhibiting vibrational - like behaviour , the results being compared with the corresponding experimental spectra .",
    "the quadrupole deformation is the fundamental mode of deformation for a spherical system .",
    "it can be described by a set of five amplitudes that form the components of a spherical tensor .",
    "the five tensorial coordinates are usually transformed by bohr - mottelson parametrization to three orientation angles @xmath12 and two shape variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in this parametrization",
    ", the potential energy of the nuclear deformation depends only on the shape variables and its general form up to the sixth order is given in the generalized collective model @xcite as @xmath13 while the corresponding kinetic energy is quadratic in the time derivatives of all variables and can be separated into a vibrational part @xmath14 and a rotational part given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the moments of inertia respectively the angular frequencies associated to the principal axes indexed by @xmath18 . due to the treatment of the vibrations and rotations on equal footing ,",
    "the kinetic energy involves a single mass parameter @xmath19 .",
    "a schrdinger equation in the @xmath20 coordinates is obtained by following the general prescription for quantization in curvilinear coordinates and the result is the well known bohr - mottelson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , the quantification procedure is based on the metric defined by the classical kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "imposing some constraints on the kinetic energy one can reduce the number of variables and therefore obtain a different hamiltonian . indeed , by freezing the @xmath0 variable ( @xmath21 ) the vibrational energy becomes @xmath22 in this case @xmath0 is no longer a variable , being a simple parameter characterizing the shape . by quantizing now the system of remaining variables",
    "one recovers the davydov - chaban model @xcite for @xmath0-rigid nuclei where the volume element is proportional to @xmath23 not to @xmath10 like in the usual bohr - mottelson approach .",
    "going further , and considering the axially symmetric prolate case ( @xmath24 ) , one reduces the number of variables even more . for",
    "axially symmetric shapes the orientation angle with respect to the symmetry axis is indeterminate which leads to vanishing moment of inertia along the corresponding axis : @xmath25 in this situation , the rotational motion is described only by two degrees of freedom @xmath26 while the vibrational motion described by ( [ kinv ] ) is restricted only to oscillations preserving the axial symmetry .",
    "the quantization in the curvilinear coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath1 shape variable , provides the following operators for the two parts of the kinetic energy : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular momentum in the intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "now one can write the hamiltonian associated to a prolate rigid nucleus as : @xmath31+u(\\beta ) . \\label{h}\\ ] ] the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian describes a variety of different types of collective motion depending on the potential energy function and the inertial parameters .",
    "the restrictions imposed so far changes not only the hamiltonian but also its associated hilbert space which in this case is defined by a metric proportional to @xmath3 consistent with the remaining three degrees of freedom , i.e. two euler angles and the @xmath1 shape variable",
    ". it also leaves us only with the choice of the potential energy of the nuclear deformation @xmath32 , restricting thus the applicability of the above hamiltonian only to the family of @xmath1 vibrational nuclei with @xmath0-rigid axial symmetry .",
    "the schrdinger equation associated to such a hamiltonian is solved by separating the @xmath1 variable from the angular ones which is achieved through the factorization : @xmath33 where the angular factor state is a spherical harmonic function and has the property : @xmath34 with this the schrdinger equation is reduced to a second order differential equation in variable @xmath1 : @xmath35f(\\beta)=0.\\ ] ] this equation can be written also in the following form : @xmath36f(\\beta)=0 , \\label{bmr}\\ ] ] where the following notations were used : @xmath37 up to this point the proceedings are exactly the same as in the construction of the @xmath2 model @xcite . as @xmath2 is the @xmath0 rigid version of the @xmath8 critical point symmetry @xcite , it uses an infinite square well potential which leads to a bessel equation . given the different choice of the potential , here one will treat equation ( [ bmr ] ) differently from ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , making the change of function @xmath38 one obtains the equation : @xmath39f(\\beta)=0 , \\label{fb}\\ ] ] which resembles the radial schrdinger equation for a three - dimensional isotropic potential @xmath40 .",
    "the quartic anharmonic oscillator potential in @xmath1 variable , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , is the lowest order anharmonic potential when @xmath24 . with this choice of the potential @xmath40 and the assumptions of the last section",
    ", the energy @xmath43 then can be calculated as the eigenvalue of a hamiltonian with a qaop and a centrifugal barrier factorized by @xmath44 . the schrdinder equation for a qaop",
    "can not be solved exactly .",
    "however there are more than a few approximative methods for finding its eigenvalues which depend on the relative importance of the two terms . here",
    "one will employ the method from ref.@xcite for calculating the eigenvalues @xmath43 , which to our knowledge is the only one providing analytical formulas for it .",
    "even though the prescription of ref.@xcite refers to an @xmath45-dimensional quartic anharmonic oscillator it can be applied to the case of a more general centrifugal term given the fact that the orbital angular momentum is treated as a simple parameter in the derivation of the corresponding formulas . as the eq.([fb ] ) with an oscillator potential @xmath46 can be brought to a form corresponding to laguerre polynomials like in the case of the usual three - dimensional harmonic oscillator , the above mentioned procedure can indeed be applied in the present case because the numerical eigenvalues for qaop are usually obtained in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "although the formulas are derived on the basis of the forth order approximation made on the jeffreys - wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( jwkb ) quantization rule @xcite , the numerical results are very precise with respect to extensive numerical computations @xcite for few selected potentials of the form ( [ quartic ] ) . moreover , the jwkb based energies in any order of approximation preserve the scaling property @xmath47 of the exact eigenvalues .",
    "this means that one can find the eigenvalues of ( [ fb ] ) by solving the schrdinger equation for the potential @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "this is actually equivalent to the change of variable @xmath50 in ( [ fb ] ) .",
    "following the procedure of ref.@xcite one can write the following formula for the energy value @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53,\\ ] ] with @xmath54 being a constant which is given together with the functions @xmath55 in appendix .",
    "the energy ( [ w ] ) is indexed by the principal quantum number @xmath56 which is associated to the number of @xmath1 vibration quanta and the angular momentum @xmath57 of the collective rotation .",
    "the dependence on angular momentum @xmath57 comes from the angular degrees of freedom defining the centrifugal term .",
    "the energy of a nucleus described by the rotation - vibration hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with qaop is then given by @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{en}\\ ] ] so up to an overall scaling factor the energies depend only on one parameter , namely @xmath59 . when @xmath60 the problem is reduced to the pure quartic oscillator , where the above analytical formula for the energy levels still holds but no longer depend on any parameter except the factorizing one . in this case one",
    "obtains a parameter free model which will be called @xmath2-@xmath10 on account of the same structure as the already established @xmath2 model .",
    "considering the other limit of the quartic potential , i.e. @xmath61 , one recovers the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "it must be emphasized that the adopted formalism does not yield the correct harmonic oscillator energy levels because the expansion of the jwkb integrals is about the pure quartic oscillator levels .",
    "however , obtaining the harmonic oscillator results by solving eq.([fb ] ) with an oscillator potential @xmath46 is straightforward , providing the following energy @xmath62 , \\label{eho}\\ ] ] normalized to the ground state . in this way one",
    "produced another parameter free model in the same three - dimensional space which will be denoted hereafter as @xmath2-@xmath3 , following the above mentioned reasons .",
    "an important consequence of the analytical expression of the qaop energy is the possibility to derive the expectation values for the even powers of the associated radial variable from hypervirial relations @xcite using hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "thus , taking into account the scaling relation ( [ scal ] ) and the prescription of ref.@xcite one can express the first order even moment as follows : @xmath63 unfortunately , except some recurrence relations between different order moments @xcite , there are no analytical formulas available for the nondiagonal moments @xmath64 which would be useful for calculating electromagnetic transition probabilities .",
    "the energy levels of the ground state band ( @xmath65 ) , as well as of the @xmath1 vibrational bands ( @xmath66 ) defined by equation ( [ en ] ) and normalized to the energy of the lowest excited state @xmath67 depend only on @xmath59 .",
    "the shapes of the axially symmetric nuclei are parametrized by a nuclear deformation parameter which is not a directly measurable observable .",
    "then instead one usually describes different nuclear shape phases in terms of the ratio @xmath11 between the lowest two collective energy levels @xmath68 and @xmath67 . in the framework of ibm @xcite to each shape phase there",
    "is associated a dynamical symmetry whose signature is a specific value of @xmath11 . thus it should be useful to check the applicability of our model by studying the dependence of @xmath11 on the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "1 , where one also represented the ratio between the second @xmath69 state energy from the first @xmath1 excited band and the @xmath67 ground band energy . beside @xmath11 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath70 is another key signature characterizing the dynamical symmetries , especially those associated to a critical point of a shape phase transition .",
    "the specific polynomial structure of the energy ( [ w ] ) as function of @xmath59 visualized in fig.[w0i ] produce a minimum at @xmath71 and a pole in @xmath11 at the value @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 intersect each other .",
    "it becomes clear from fig.[w0i ] that the adopted method for the determination of the qaop eigenvalues provides reliable results only for a limited interval of @xmath59 .",
    "it is well known that the accuracy of the jwkb generated eigenvalues is increasing with the order of the solution @xcite , i.e. the quantum numbers .",
    "thus , in order to establish the upper limit of the parameter @xmath59 for which one would still obtain reliable eigenvalues , it is sufficient to compare the present numerical results with the available exact eigenvalues only for the ground state .",
    "taking as a benchmark the exact ground state eigenvalue computed in ref.@xcite for the three - dimensional potential @xmath75 which corresponds to @xmath76 , one finds that the present calculations overestimates the corresponding eigenvalue by 4.3% which is more than satisfactory .",
    "however , in the view of the present physical context , one will choose for the upper limit of @xmath59 the value @xmath77 which is associated to the ratio @xmath78 characterizing vibrational nuclei , ensuring in this way an even better accuracy .",
    "thus , in the following calculations one will consider the values of @xmath59 only from the interval @xmath79 $ ] where @xmath11 is unambiguously defined with values ranging continuously from 2.286 to 2 , and correspondingly with @xmath70 taking values between 2.374 and 1.808 as is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the same figure one also visualised for comparison the ratios provided by @xmath2-@xmath3 model , which amounts to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , consequently falling in the existence interval of the present model .",
    "although the potential ( [ quartic ] ) depends on two parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the normalized energy spectrum can be described only by @xmath59 . as a matter of fact , the shape of the potential ( [ quartic ] )",
    "is also determined only by @xmath59 through its scaled version ( [ ut ] ) .",
    "indeed , the scaled potential ( [ ut ] ) is a function of @xmath84 variable which depend on @xmath83 , such that for the same @xmath59 the potential ( [ quartic ] ) will have the same shape with a larger width for smaller @xmath83 .",
    "the shapes of the scaled potential for different values of @xmath59 are shown in fig.[pot ] as function of the scaled variable @xmath84 . from this figure",
    "one can see that the flattest potential corresponds to the pure quartic oscillator case @xmath60 .",
    "as the critical point potential must exhibit a flat behaviour , it can be inferred that the pure quartic oscillator potential is a critical one at least for the family of the general anharmonic potentials of the form ( [ quartic ] ) in the @xmath0-rigid regime .",
    "concerning the allowed values only for @xmath11 , it should be noted that the highest value @xmath85 is achieved for the pure quartic potential , while the lowest admissible value @xmath86 is very close to the signature of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model described by @xmath80 . moreover",
    ", the flexible structure of the present model allows the description of all interpolating solutions lying in between the @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath10 model realizations through the continuous variation of a single parameter , @xmath59 .",
    "this transition is best seen in the evolution of the ground band as function of angular momentum for values of @xmath59 corresponding to the shapes of the scaled potential depicted in fig.[pot ] which is visualized in fig.[ej ] where one also shown the @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath2-@xmath3 predictions .",
    "one can easily observe that for @xmath60 the ground band spectrum has a behaviour distinct from those corresponding to @xmath87 , being the steepest one . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath59 , more closer to the rotational behaviour @xmath88 is the corresponding ground band spectrum and consequently farther from the vibrational behaviour @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath60 case seems to be positioned at the half way between the @xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath3 model predictions with the lower region covered by the present model with @xmath90 . in what concerns",
    "the spectra situated between @xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath10 , these can be described by eventual @xmath2-@xmath91 critical models as in the five - dimensional phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the same picture is also found in the dependence of the energy spectrum on the vibrational quanta @xmath56 for @xmath92 shown in fig.[enn ] .",
    "another interesting feature arising from figs.[ej ] and [ enn ] is that the spectra corresponding to values of @xmath59 up to approximatively 8 are somehow bunched together and more closely at low angular momentum states .",
    "this phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that at the same value the curve of @xmath11 from fig.[4p2 ] has a significant change in its tangent . making a more detailed analysis of the function @xmath93 one",
    "ascertains that its third derivative vanishes at @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "the mathematical meaning of this fact is that the angle between the axis of the osculating parabola and the normal line associated to that point is equal to the angle made by the tangent in that point .",
    "although not in the true sense of the theory of the quantum phase transitions @xcite , one can say that there is a transition between two weakly delimited phases defined by the two sides of the value @xmath94 . combining the figs.[ej ] and [ enn ] , one visualized in fig.[spectra ] the ground band up to @xmath96 together with the first and second @xmath1 bands spectra up to @xmath97 for the pure quartic case ( @xmath60 ) and for two values of @xmath59 separated by the `` critical '' point @xmath98 followed by the corresponding @xmath2-@xmath3 results .",
    "it is worth to mention that even thought the present formalism can not be extended to the harmonic oscillator case , the @xmath2-@xmath3 predictions are fairly well simulated by our model with @xmath99 at least for the lowest lying states .",
