    "indeed , a few theoretical studies have started exploring this competition @xcite .    the study of multi - component systems may help to further the strong analogies between the dynamics of dissipative rydberg gases and soft - matter systems @xcite",

    "we then perform an idealized numerical study , where different interaction strengths lead to a variety of length scales giving rise to strikingly different dynamical regimes .",
    "the phenomenology that emerges from non - additive interactions is characterized by the formation of domains , which are homogeneously populated by excitations of a given component when inter - level interactions dominate , and show an alternation of components in the opposite case .",
