    "polarons form in many wide - band gap materials as a result of charge carrier localization due to strong electron - phonon coupling . their formation and transport are crucial to understanding important quantum mechanical processes occurring in electrochemical devices such as batteries @xcite and scintillation detectors @xcite . conventional approximations to the exchange and correlation ( xc ) potential within density - functional theory ( dft ) , such as the local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) @xcite ,",
    "fail qualitatively to describe polaron formation .",
    "hybrid functionals , which combine exact exchange ( ex ) @xcite with lda / gga to correct for the band gaps of insulators , are capable of predicting polaron formation but are computationally orders of magnitude more expensive than dft .    for small polarons localized at specific atomic sites , which is the case in in many oxides , @xcite an orbital - dependent local potential in the spirit of the dft+@xmath0 approach @xcite can be added to localize the excess charge and stabilize the polaron . while this enables one to significantly reduce the computational cost for calculating polaron energies , the approach is not viable if the polaronic state involves multiple atomic sites and/or large atomic displacements .",
    "this is unfortunately a very common occurrence , _",
    "e.g. _ in halides , where polaron formation proceeds via dimerization ( bond - centered polarons , so - called @xmath2-centers@xcite ) or in the case of polaron migration .",
    "furthermore , both hybrid - dft and local potential methods depend on adjustable parameters .",
    "the fraction of ex or the strength of the local potential are usually determined _ a priori _ for a reference configuration and then kept fixed throughout configurational changes . in summary ,",
    "numerous complications have limited the systematic investigation of polarons and their transport from first principles .",
    "the present work builds on two ideas : ( i ) the lda / gga failure to predict polaron formation is mainly due to the self - interaction ( si ) of the localizing carrier @xcite and ( ii ) while lda and gga severely underestimate the band gaps of insulators , they accurately predict band edge variations , induced by configurational changes @xcite .",
    "based on these considerations , we propose a simple modification to the dft total - energy functional , the _ polaron self - interaction correction _ ( psic ) , that accounts for the spurious polaron si without explicit addition of ex , and without an implicit limitation to site - centered local potentials .",
    "the resulting psic - dft functional is parameter - free , can be used for _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics simulations of hole as well as electron polarons in arbitrary band insulators with an accuracy that is on par with the best hybrid - dft parametrizations , at a computational cost comparable with standard dft",
    ". its strength and versatility is demonstrated by studying formation and migration of hole - polarons in the alkali halide family of compounds , and electron polarons in cs@xmath3liycl@xmath4 ( clyc ) , which is an elpasolite compound that has received much attention in recent years due to its potential as a scintillator material .",
    "it is important to point out that the polaron self - interaction correction can be applied to any xc functional .",
    "naturally , when applied to hybrid functionals , the psic method does not decrease the computational cost .",
    "however , also in these cases , psic leads to a systematic improvement and significantly reduces the sensitivity of the results to hybrid parametrization .",
    "this lends further credibility to the psic method as a general formalism applicable to polarons in crystalline and disordered insulators as well as molecular systems , whenever the removal or addition of an electron from / to a frontier orbital ( highest occupied or lowest unoccupied quasi - particle state ) drives a structural change .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : discussion ] summarizes and discusses the findings of the present work .",
    "finally , computational details are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we motivate and develop the psic method by revisiting the failure of standard dft functionals for hole self - trapping in the alkali halide compound nai @xcite .",

    "the crystal consists of two interpenetrating fcc sublattices , each consisting of either na or i ions only .",
    "the ionic bonding in nai leads to an insulating ground - state electronic structure with a band gap of 5.9ev @xcite .",
    "the valence band is dominated by hybridized iodine @xmath5-orbitals , while the conduction band consists mainly of sodium @xmath6-orbitals . when a hole is introduced in the valence band , it mediates covalent bonding between nearest neighbor iodine ions leading to dimerization ; this implies hole localization and thus the formation of a polaron@xcite . in the following section , the pathway to polaron formation in nai",
    "is studied from various angles using dft as well as hybrid xc functionals .",
    "-center in nai .",
    "the `` optimized hybrid '' has an ex fraction of @xmath7 . in agreement with the hybrid functionals",
    "psic - dft yields a stable polaron configuration .",
    "uncorrected dft qualitatively fails to reproduce self - trapping . ]",
    "when a hole is introduced in the valence band of nai , it induces a substantial lattice distortion , causing a pair of nearest - neighbor i@xmath8 ions to move along @xmath9 toward each other .",
    "their separation is reduced from 4.5  in the perfect crystal to about 3.3 , effectively leading to the formation of an anion dimer i@xmath10 ( a @xmath2-center ) .",
    "the dimerization is accompanied by displacements of the surrounding atoms that help to accommodate the lattice strain .",
    "figure  [ fig : self_trapping_path ] shows the energy along a particular pathway to self - trapping calculated from ( i ) dft based on the pbe xc functional @xcite , ( ii ) the pbe0 hybrid - ex functional with 0.25 fraction of ex @xcite , and ( iii ) an optimized hybrid - ex functional in which the fraction of ex ( @xmath7 ) has been chosen to reproduce the band gap of nai calculated with pbe+@xmath1 .",
    "further computational details are listed in the appendix .",
    "figure  [ fig : self_trapping_path ] clearly shows that when a hole charge is present in the system , the pbe xc functional predicts the undistorted lattice to be the lowest energy configuration . according to pbe , the hole in the valence shell is thus a homogeneously distributed delocalized carrier .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : self_trapping_path ] also demonstrates that hybrid functionals , which include some fraction of ex , allow the system to lower its energy via a lattice distortion that couples to the hole charge and triggers its localization .",

    "it is important to mention here that in the absence of charge excitations , dft predicts accurate ground state ( gs ) energies as well as phonon spectra for nai .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : psic ] ( left panel ) shows that in the neutral charge state , pbe and @xmath1 quasiparticle ( qp ) energies for a supercell containing atomic displacements of a @xmath2-center , are in good agreement with each other apart from a rigid relative shift of the valence and the conduction bands , the so - called scissor shift that compensates for the absence of derivative discontinuity in the pbe functional . a more detailed comparison between the qp spectra from pbe , optimized hybrid , and @xmath1 is given in fig .  [ fig : nai ] .",
    "the close agreement of the qp energies implies that for the neutral charge state , the pbe - ks potential is a good approximation to the optimized effective potential ( oep ) obtained from the exact xc functional . as a result , for _ this _",
    "charge state pbe accurately predicts both the gs energy of the @xmath2-center , as well as the qp energy of the hole state relative to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : psic ] ( right panel ) shows that in the charged state , the unoccupied hole level virtually overlaps with the vbm , which implies a delocalized hole character .",
    "this explains why pbe predicts no binding for the @xmath2-center in fig .",
    "[ fig : self_trapping_path ] .    before embarking on a formal discussion ,",
    "it is beneficial to inspect the failure of dft for the charged @xmath2-center in nai from the perspective of the si error of the localized hole .",
    "this is illustrated in the center panel of figure  [ fig : psic ] , where the deviation of the dft energy from linearity as a function of the fractional hole charge in the system is shown for ( i ) the perfect crystal and ( ii ) the dimerized @xmath2-center configuration .",
    "it is apparent that the delocalized hole carrier in the perfect crystal ( with negligible si ) exhibits very little deviation from linearity while significant non - linearity is observed in the energetics of the localized polaron in the @xmath2-center configuration . in accord with recent literature",
    "@xcite , we ascribe this nonlinearity to the dft si error for the localized polaron .",

    "[ fig : psic ] ( center panel ) curves in such a way as to raise the energy of the charged polaronic configuration relative to that of the ideal lattice , and thus prevents binding .",
    "the effect of the si error on the stability of polarons within dft has also been discussed in ref .  .",
    "we now formalize the above discussion with the goal to derive a robust method for structural relaxations as well as _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of polarons in general insulating systems with a computational efficiency comparable to lda / gga , which does not rely on _ a priori _ knowledge or guesswork .",
    "consider an extended many - electron system in a periodic supercell containing @xmath11 ions , at a reference electronic configuration , say , the neutral ground state . in the following ,",
    "we denote the number of electrons in this reference charge state by @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the dft energy of this system as a function of the fraction @xmath14 of excess electrons / holes .",
    "the ion positions are specified by the @xmath15-dimensional vector @xmath16 , where @xmath11 is the number of ions in the system .",
    "we break down the contributions to the energy at arbitrary @xmath14 as follows @xmath17    = &    e_{\\text{dft}}[n_e;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ]    \\pm \\delta\\cdot\\mu_{\\text{dft}}^{\\pm}[{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ]     \\nonumber\\\\    & \\quad + \\pi_{\\text{dft}}[\\pm \\delta;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the electron chemical potential , defined as @xmath19= \\lim_{\\eta\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\partial e_{\\text{dft}}}{\\partial n}[n_e\\pm\\eta;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 quantifies the deviation of @xmath21 from linearity and thus can be used as a measure of the polaron si .",
    "figure  [ fig : psic ] ( center panel ) shows that the @xmath2-center configuration becomes stabilized for @xmath22 if the term @xmath20 ( the polaron si ) is eliminated from the above equation .    at first sight , this seems to counter the well - known fact that the electron chemical potentials @xmath18 , calculated within dft , are inaccurate predictors of the highest occupied ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular ( lumo ) levels in molecules and of band gaps in solids .",
    "the curvatures of lda / gga functionals resulting from their si are , however , such that they correct the values of the differential quantities @xmath18 for the homo / lumo levels in small molecules .",
    "this constitutes the basis for the so - called delta - scf method , which has been quite successful in molecular applications .",
    "it is however , a precarious practice to correct for the lack of derivative discontinuity in lda / gga xc functionals @xcite by their si error .",
    "in particular , @xmath23 $ ] can have a spurious dependence on the ionic configuration @xmath16 and thus lead to wrong structural predictions .",
    "this can most dramatically be demonstrated in insulating solids such as nai , where the perfect crystal structure has negligible si while @xmath20 is quite substantial for the self - trapped polaron .",
    "the strong configuration dependence of @xmath20 leads to the failure to predict polaron formation in these systems .",
    "a systematic correction should rather correct @xmath18 by adding the contribution from the derivative discontinuity of the exact exchange - correlation functional , which is missing in lda / gga .",
    "hence we propose the following polaron si corrected ( psic ) total energy functional for a system with an added electron / hole : @xmath24 = e_{\\text{dft}}[n_e;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] \\pm \\mu_{\\text{dft}}^{\\pm}[{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] \\pm \\delta_\\text{xc}^{\\pm}[{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] ,    \\label{eq : final0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the missing contribution of the derivative discontinuity of the exchange - correlation functional to the chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "it can be formally expressed as @xmath26 = \\lim_{\\eta\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\partial e^{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial n}[n_e\\pm\\eta;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] - { \\varepsilon}^\\text{exact - oep}_{\\pm}[n_e;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied eigenvalues of the exact oep potential in the reference charge state , respectively .",
    "note that for the @xmath29 functional in eq .",

    "we have shown in sect .",
    "[ subsec : basic ] that this is indeed the case for the closed - shell neutral charge state of nai .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to argue that for defect - free band insulators in the closed - shell neutral charge state , common approximate xc functionals are likely to produce reasonably accurate ks potentials .",
    "the derivative discontinuity @xmath31 , can be calculated accurately via many - body perturbation theory , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the @xmath32 approximation@xcite . in this formalism",
    ", @xmath25 correspond to the so - called scissor shifts , which constitute the difference between the electron addition / removal energies calculated using dft+@xmath1 and their respective dft values .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown by baldereschi , gygi and fiorentini @xcite that @xmath25 is dominated by the long - range components of the static coulomb - hole plus screened exchange ( cohsex ) contributions .",
    "therefore @xmath25 varies weakly with localized lattice distortions such as those typically associated with polarons , so long as the dft produces accurate ks potentials for the ionic configurations of interest .",
    "hence , we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : final0 ] ) significantly by neglecting the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath16 .",
    "next , we observe that with regard to defects in general and polarons in particular , one is interested in energy differences .",

    "the detailed expressions for calculating polaron binding energies can be found in sect .",

    "( [ eq : final0 ] ) .",
    "we thus arrive at the expression @xmath33 = \\delta e_{\\text{dft}}[n_e;{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] \\pm \\delta \\mu_{\\text{dft}}^{\\pm}[{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{r } } ] .",

    "a reasonable way to incorporate contributions from static screening of exchange in the total - energy functional is through the hybrid technique .",
    "of course the fraction of ex in the hybrid functional , or in other words the magnitude of static screening , needs to be determined _ a priori_.    equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) describes a general formalism for correcting polaron self - interaction in any xc functional . up to now , our discussion has been primarily concerned with calculations based on semilocal xc functionals such as pbe , but everything said still holds if one were to correct a hybrid - xc functional for polaron self - interaction .",

    ", we also benchmark calculated polaron migration barriers with measured diffusivities in nai . by symmetry , the migration of an i@xmath10 dimer to a nearest - neighbor site in the rocksalt lattice can involve rotations through @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 or @xmath71 , the last one corresponding to a pure translation .",
    "the polaron diffusivity in alkali halides can be accurately measured in laser pump - probe experiments @xcite . to this end , @xmath2-centers are created and aligned along a particular direction ( `` polarized '' ) using a pump laser .",
    "subsequently , the gradual loss of polarization over time is followed using a probe laser , from which rotational barriers can be inferred .",
    "experiments can not distinguish between @xmath68 and @xmath70 rotations and are insensitive to migration via translation . in nai at 50k , one observes almost exclusively @xmath72 rotations @xcite , indicative of the fact that their activation barriers are noticeably smaller than for @xmath69 rotations .",

    "table  [ tab : migration ] shows activation barriers calculated within the psic - pbe and optimized hybrid approaches using the climbing image nudged elastic band method @xcite . both methods agree very well with each other and with experimental data .",
    "lastly , we demonstrate the accuracy of the psic method for electron polarons . for this purpose , we consider cs@xmath3liycl@xmath4 ( clyc ) , which is one of the most thoroughly investigated compounds in the elpasolite family due to its potential as a neutron detector .",
    "electron polarons have been found in this system both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite using pbe0 calculations .",
    "its crystal structure ( double - perovskite ) has cubic symmetry with ten atoms in the primitive cell . here",
    ", electron polaron calculations were performed using 80-atom supercells with a @xmath73 @xmath74-point sampling .",
    "the calculated band gap within pbe0 is 7.1ev , in close agreement with experiment ( 7.5ev ) @xcite .",
    "hence pbe0 and optimized hybrid yield nearly identical results for this compound . by comparison , dft - pbe yields a much smaller band gap of 5.0ev .",
    "we find in accord with ref .",
    "that the electron polaron localizes on a y - site and the polaron level has strong @xmath75-character as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clyc ] . both psic - pbe and pbe0",
    "predict a stretching of y - cl bonds by about 0.1 .",
    "the binding energy of the electron polaron is 0.25ev ( 0.32ev ) according to psic - pbe ( pbe0 ) .",
    "the pbe0 value for the polaron binding energy includes a significant contribution from image charge corrections of about 0.1ev due to the small size of the supercells ( 80 atoms ) that was computationally affordable at this time .",
    "( note that the hitherto most recent calculation for the electron polaron in this system was performed in a 40-atom supercell @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , performing psic - pbe0 calculation of the polaron energy in the ionic confguration obtained from the conventional pbe0 approach , yields a polaron binding energy of about 0.28 ev , in very good agreement with the psic - pbe result .",
    "this demonstrates that psic is also capable of predicting _ electron _ polaron geometries and binding energies in close agreement with hybrid calculations .    in order to illustrate that this agreement is not fortuitous , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : clyc_bnd ] the quasi - particle spectra of clyc calculated within dft , as well as pbe0 for the ideal and polaron configurations in their charge - neutral states .",
    "note that the scissor shift is independent of configuration and that the calculated position of the localized electron level relative to the conduction - band minimum within dft agrees well with pbe0 .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a self - interaction correction technique , the so - called psic method , that corrects the dft failure to predict stable polarons in insulators .",
    "the psic - dft method is parameter - free and easy to implement in existing electronic structure codes .",
    "we have validated the new methodology by benchmarking psic - pbe results to hybrid - dft functionals for both electron and hole polaron formation and transport in a number of materials .",
    "thereby , we have shown that ( i ) polaron trapping energies depend sensitively on the parametrization of the hybrid functionals , ( ii ) the parameter - free psic - pbe method exhibits similar accuracy to hybrid functionals that are laboriously parametrized to fit @xmath32 band gaps on a case by case basis , and ( iii ) is an order of magnitude faster .",
    "this presents a breakthrough in modeling the structure and dynamics of polarons in insulators from first principles .    from a fundamental physics perspective",
    ", the psic method emerges as a result of the decoupling of the two main problematic features of dft for band insulators : ( i ) severe underestimation of band gaps , and ( ii ) absence of localized polarons .",
    "the counterintuitive aspect of such a decoupling is that it is well - known that polaron stability is greatly enhanced for large - gap systems .",
    "hence significant correlation between the band gap of an insulator and its polaron binding energy should be expected .",
    "based on this , it is then logical to argue that the lack of stable polarons in insulators within the dft must stem from its band gap error .",
    "in fact , the two errors are unrelated as shown by the following arguments : ( i ) for the exact xc functional , the electron addition / removal energies can be extracted from differential quantities , _",
    "i.e. _ chemical potentials , ( ii ) for most band insulators , there is a charge state , usually the closed - shell neutral charge state , for which dft can predict accurate ground - state energies as well as valence and conduction band structures , and ( iii ) while lda and gga severely underestimate the band gaps of insulators , they accurately predict band edge variations with configurational changes . noting that polaron binding does sensitively depend on the variation of the ground - state energy and band edges with configuration rather than the absolute value of the scissor shift",
    ", it follows that polaron binding is independent of the absolute value of the band gap error .    in order to rationalize the success of the psic approach , we have applied it to correct for the psi in hybrid xc functionals",
    ". in this process",
    ", we have shown that in band insulators , hybrid functionals tuned to reproduce the dft+@xmath1 band gaps are practically polaron self - interaction error free , and thus constitute the optimal parametrization .",
    "our key finding however , is that calculations of polaron energies within the conventional approach , _ i.e. _ using charged supercells , are very sensitive to the fraction @xmath43 of ex included in the hybrid functional . on the other hand ,",
    "the psic - hybrid method is almost insensitive to @xmath43 , and little compromise on accuracy will result from drastically simplifying the calculations by setting @xmath76 . on this basis ,",
    "the parameter - free psic - pbe method emerges .",
    "the psic formalism can be applied to more general systems than has been presented in this paper . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we have intentionally limited the present scope to intrinsic polaron self - trapping in crystalline insulators .",
    "we have shown that in these systems , the neutral charge state is described accurately within pbe ( or more generally dft ) .",
    "hence this reference state has been used to calculate the energy of charge excitations in the presence of lattice distortions using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyb - psic ] ) .",
    "more generally , the psic formalism can be applied to both defects in insulating solids , as well as molecular systems whenever structural rearrangements are driven by addition / removal of electron or holes in frontier orbitals .",
    "the psic method allows any supercell calculation containing @xmath12 electrons , whether periodic or not , to be performed in any of the three charge states @xmath12 , @xmath77 , or @xmath78 .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that in the case of perfect crystalline insulators , there is large variability with charge state with respect to the quality of the ks potentials produced from pbe . by choosing to perform the calculations in the charge state with the highest quality ks potential ,",
    "the psic method enables dramatic enhancements of the accuracy of dft xc functionals , for prediction of potential energy landscapes of polarons in these systems .",
    "the subject of defects in insulators and semiconductors is vast and complex , and of huge interest to many applications .",
    "recently , the effect of @xmath32 corrections on the formation energies of charged defects in semiconductors was examined @xcite . in these works ,",
