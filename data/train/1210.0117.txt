    "_ max - plus algebra _ is the algebraic structure obtained when considering the _ max - plus semifield _ @xmath1 .",
    "this semifield is defined as the set @xmath2 endowed with @xmath3 as addition and the usual real numbers addition @xmath4 as multiplication .",
    "thus , in the max - plus semifield , the neutral elements for addition and multiplication are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the max - plus semifield is algebraically isomorphic to the _ max - times semifield _ @xmath7 , also known as the max - prod semifield ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which is given by the set @xmath8 endowed with @xmath9 as addition and the usual real numbers product @xmath10 as multiplication .",
    "consequently , in the max - times semifield , @xmath6 is the neutral element for addition and @xmath11 is the neutral element for multiplication .    in this paper",
    "we consider both of these semifields at the same time , under the common notation @xmath12 and under the common name _",
    "tropical algebra_. in what follows @xmath12 denotes either the max - plus semifield @xmath1 or the max - times semifield @xmath7 .",
    "we will use @xmath13 to denote the neutral element for addition , @xmath14 to denote the neutral element for multiplication , and @xmath15 to denote the set of all invertible elements with respect to the multiplication , i.e. , all the elements of @xmath12 different from @xmath13 .",
    "the space @xmath16 of @xmath17-dimensional vectors @xmath18 , endowed naturally with the component - wise addition ( also denoted by @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 as the multiplication of a scalar @xmath21 by a vector @xmath22 , is a semimodule over @xmath12 .",
    "the vector @xmath23 is also denoted by @xmath13 , and it is the identity for @xmath19 .    in _ tropical convexity _",
    ", one first defines the _ tropical segment _ joining the points @xmath24 as the set @xmath25 , and then calls a set @xmath26 _ tropically convex _ if it contains the tropical segment joining any two of its points ( see figure  [ f : segment - plane ] below for an illustration of tropical segments in dimension @xmath27 ) .",
    "similarly , the notions of _ cone , halfspace , semispace , hemispace , convex hull , linear span , convex and linear combination _ , can be transferred to the tropical setting ( precise definitions are given below ) .",
    "henceforth all these terms used without precisions should always be understood in the max - plus or max - times ( i.e. tropical ) sense .",
    "the interest in this convexity ( also known as _ max - plus convexity _ when @xmath28 , or _ max - times convexity _ or _ @xmath29-convexity _ when @xmath30 ) comes from several fields , some of which we next review .",
    "convexity in @xmath16 and in more general semimodules was introduced by zimmermann  @xcite under the name `` extremal convexity '' with applications e.g. to discrete optimization problems and it was studied by maslov , kolokoltsov , litvinov , shpiz and others as part of the idempotent analysis  @xcite , inspired by the fact that the solutions of a hamilton - jacobi equation associated with a deterministic optimal control problem belong to structures similar to convex cones .",
    "another motivation arises from the algebraic approach to discrete event systems initiated by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite , since the reachable and observable spaces of certain timed discrete event systems are naturally equipped with structures of cones of @xmath16 ( see e.g. cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . motivated by tropical algebraic geometry and applications in phylogenetic analysis , develin and sturmfels studied polyhedral convex sets in @xmath16 thinking of them as classical polyhedral complexes  @xcite .",
    "many results that are part of classical convexity theory can be carried over to the setting of @xmath16 : separation of convex sets and projection operators ( gaubert and sergeev  @xcite ) , minimization of distance and description of sets of best approximation ( akian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , discrete convexity results such as minkowski theorem ( gaubert and katz  @xcite ) , helly , caratheodory and radon theorems ( briec and horvath  @xcite ) , colorful caratheodory and tverberg theorems ( gaubert and meunier  @xcite ) , to quote a few .    here",
    "we investigate _ hemispaces in @xmath16 _ , which are convex sets in @xmath16 whose complements in @xmath16 are also convex .",
    "the definition of hemispaces makes sense in other structures once the notion of convex set is defined .",
    "hemispaces also appear in the literature under the name of halfspaces , convex halfspaces , and generalized halfspaces . as general convex sets",
    "are quite complicated in many convexity structures , a simple description of hemispaces is highly desirable .",
    "usual hemispaces in @xmath31 are described by lassak in  @xcite .",
    "martnez - legaz and singer  @xcite give several geometric characterization of usual hemispaces in @xmath31 with the aid of linear operators and lexicographic order in @xmath31 .",
    "hemispaces play a role in abstract convexity ( see singer  @xcite , van de vel  @xcite ) , where they are used in the kakutani theorem to separate two convex sets from each other .",
    "the proof of kakutani theorem makes use of zorn s lemma ( relying on the pasch axiom , which holds both in tropical and usual convexity ) .",
    "a different approach is to start from the separation of a point from a closed convex set , as investigated in many works ( e.g. , zimmermann  @xcite , litvinov  et  al .",
    "@xcite , cohen  et  al .",
    "@xcite , develin and sturmfels  @xcite , briec  et  al .",
    "this hahn - banach type result is extended to the separation of several convex sets by an application of non - linear perron - frobenius theory by gaubert and sergeev in  @xcite .    in the hahn - banach approach ,",
    "tropically convex sets are separated by means of closed halfspaces in @xmath16 , defined as sets of vectors @xmath22 in @xmath16 satisfying an inequality of the form @xmath32 .",
    "as shown by joswig  @xcite , closed halfspaces in @xmath16 are unions of several closed sectors , which are convex tropically and in the ordinary sense .",
    "briec and horvath  @xcite proved that the topological closure of any hemispace in @xmath16 is a closed halfspace in @xmath16 .",
    "hence closed halfspaces , with respect to general hemispaces , are `` almost everything '' . however , the borderline between a hemispace and its complement in @xmath16 has a generally unknown intricate pattern , with some pieces belonging to one hemispace and the rest to the other .",
    "this pattern was not revealed by briec and horvath .",
    "the present paper gives a complete characterization of hemispaces in @xmath16 by means of the so - called @xmath0-decompositions ( see definition  [ def : pr ] below ) . in dimension 2 the borderline",
    "is described explicitly and all the types of hemispaces in @xmath33 that may appear are shown in figures  [ f : hemispace - plane ] and  [ f : hemispace - line ] .",
    "thus , our result is more general than the one established in  @xcite even in dimension 2 . in higher dimensions",
    "one may use the characterization in terms of @xmath0-decompositions to describe the thin structure of the borderline quite explicitly .",
    "we now describe the basic idea of the proof of this characterization .",
    "let us first recall that like in usual convexity , a closed convex set in @xmath16 can be decomposed as the ( tropical ) minkowski sum of the convex hull of its extreme points and its recession cone ( gaubert and katz  @xcite ) . as a relaxation of this traditional approach , we suggest the concept of @xmath0-decomposition to describe general convex sets in @xmath16 .",
    "developed here in the context of tropical convexity , this concept corresponds to that of motzkin decomposition studied in usual convexity in locally convex spaces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "homogenization , which carries convex sets to convex cones , is another classical tool we exploit in the setting of @xmath16 .",
    "next , an important feature of tropical convexity ( as opposed to usual convexity ) is the existence of a finite number of types of semispaces , i.e. , maximal convex sets in @xmath16 not containing a given point .",
    "these sets were described in detail by nitica and singer  @xcite , who showed that they are precisely the complements of closed sectors .",
    "let us mention that the multiorder principle of tropical convexity  @xcite can be formulated in terms of complements of semispaces .",
    "it follows from abstract convexity that any hemispace is the union of all the complements of semispaces which it contains .",
    "these sets are closed sectors of several types .",
    "the convex hull in @xmath16 of a union of sectors of certain type gives a sector of the same type , perhaps with some pieces of the boundary missing .",
    "some degenerate cases may also appear .",
    "sectors admit a ( relatively ) simple @xmath0-decomposition , and we can combine such @xmath0-decompositions to obtain a @xmath0-decomposition of the hemispace .",
    "so far the method is quite general and geometric , and in dimension @xmath27 sufficient for classification .    for higher dimensions",
    "the fact that we deal with hemispaces becomes relevant .",
    "it turns out that a hemispace in @xmath16 admits a @xmath0-decomposition consisting of unit vectors and linear combinations of two unit vectors .",
    "thus , to characterize a hemispace by means of @xmath0-decompositions we need to understand how the linear combinations of two unit vectors are distributed among the hemispace and its complement .",
    "the proof becomes more algebraic and combinatorial , and at this point it becomes convenient to work with cones and their ( usual ) representation in terms of generators . using homogenization ,",
    "we reduce the study of general hemispaces in @xmath16 to the study of conical hemispaces in @xmath34 ( these are hemispaces in @xmath34 which are also cones or , equivalently , cones in @xmath34 whose complements enlarged with @xmath13 are also cones ) .",
    "we introduce the `` @xmath35-matrix '' , whose entries stem from the borderline between a conical hemispace and its complement in two - dimensional coordinate planes .",
    "we show that it satisfies an extended rank - one condition , and then we prove that this condition is also sufficient in order for a set to generate a conical hemispace .",
    "this part of the proof is more technical and it is given in the last third of the paper , starting with proposition  [ p : rd ] and ending with the proof of theorem  [ t : ghemi ] .",
    "we use the rank - one condition to describe the fine structure of the @xmath35-matrix , which is an independent combinatorial result of interest , and then use this structure to construct explicitly the complementary conical hemispace for a conical hemispace given by its @xmath0-decomposition .",
    "finally , we translate this result back to the @xmath0-decomposition of general hemispaces , to obtain the main result of the paper ( theorem  [ t : mainres ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : prel ] is occupied with preliminaries on convex sets in @xmath16 , and introduces the concept of @xmath0-decomposition . in section  [ s : semi ]",
    "we study semispaces in @xmath16 , in order to give , exploiting homogenization , a simpler proof of their characterization than the one given in  @xcite .",
    "hemispaces appear here as unions of ( in general , infinitely many ) complements of semispaces , i.e. , the closed sectors of  @xcite .",
    "section  [ s : hemi ] contains the main results on hemispaces in @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of subsection  [ ss : hemihomog ] is to reduce general hemispaces in @xmath16 to conical hemispaces in @xmath34 .",
    "this aim is finally achieved in theorem  [ t : hemihomog ] . in view of this theorem , in subsection",
    "[ ss : hemicone ] we study conical hemispaces only . there",
    "we prove theorem  [ t : ghemi ] as explained above , which gives a concise characterization of conical hemispaces in terms of generators . in subsection",
    "[ ss : final ] , we obtain a number of corollaries of the previous results . in the first place we verify that closed hemispaces in @xmath16",
    "are closed halfspaces in @xmath16 , a result of  @xcite , see theorem  [ t : hemishalfs ] and corollary  [ c : hemishalfs ] .",
    "finally , the main result of this paper is given in theorem  [ t : mainres ] of subsection  [ ss : mainres ] .",

    "for simplicity of the notation , we identify @xmath50 with @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and write simply @xmath53 for them .    to introduce a topology we need to specialize @xmath12 to one of the models .",
