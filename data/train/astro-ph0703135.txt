    "formation and evolution of structures in the universe has been one of the central issues in modern astronomy .",
    "filamentary structures are predicted to grow from the initial density fluctuations of the universe and filaments are distributed all over the universe forming the cosmic web . at crossroads of filaments ,",
    "we often see massive clusters of galaxies ( e.g. rxj0152.7@xmath013 cluster ; @xcite ) .",
    "clusters should grow through the hierarchical assembly of galaxies flowing along filaments , and indeed they are often found to accompany filamentary / clumpy structures around them ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , we focus on one of the highest redshift x - ray clusters to date , rdcs j1252.92927 ( rdcsj1252 hereafter ) at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "rdcsj1252 was discovered in _",
    "rosat deep cluster survey _ and the mass of the cluster was estimated to be @xmath14 @xcite . following the discovery ,",
    "the cluster has been a subject of extensive observations .",
    "@xcite reported acs imaging on the cluster and presented a tight colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) of early - type galaxies .",
    "the superb resolution of acs enabled a clear detection of the weak shear signal from this high-@xmath8 cluster @xcite .",
    "in addition to the optical hst imaging , ground - based near - ir imaging was also conducted .",
    "@xcite showed a clear near - ir cmr , and @xcite claimed that luminosity function of the cluster galaxies has a shallower slope than that of a local cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a @xmath10 band lf of the cluster based on deep near - ir imaging ( they also derived lfs of two other @xmath15 clusters ) .",
    "an analysis of the fundamental plane was also performed based on the deep spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we extend the investigation of this cluster further by obtaining the new and unique multi - band wide - field images of this cluster .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the faint end of the cmr of red galaxies .",
    "recent work on cmr suggested that high redshift clusters exhibit a deficit of faint red galaxies compared to local clusters @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the down - sizing in star formation activities of galaxies @xcite  hosts of active star formation shifts from massive galaxies to less massive ones as the universe ages .",
    "it seems that this down - sizing depends on large - scale environment in the sense that it is delayed in low - density environments ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . in this paper , we put an emphasis on the environmental variation of the faint end of the cmr to test this environment - dependent down - sizing picture .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction . then we present distribution of galaxies around rdcsj1252 in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes deep sofi observations of the discovered clumps of galaxies .",
    "we examine the cmrs of red galaxies in the structure in section 5 .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our findings in sections 6 and 7 . throughout this paper , we assume a flat universe with @xmath16 and h@xmath17 .",
    "all the magnitudes are presented on the ab system .",
    "we use the following abbreviations : cmd for colour - magnitude diagram , cmr for colour - magnitude relation , and lf for luminosity function .",
    "we observed rdcsj1252 with suprime - cam @xcite on the subaru telescope in the @xmath18 bands under photometric conditions .",
    "the images are smoothed to their worst seeing size of @xmath19 arcsec in fwhm . since",
    "this cluster lies at a high redshift , even the @xmath6-band does not firmly straddle the 4000@xmath20 break , and a good performance of photometric redshift can not be achieved with the optical data only .",
    "therefore , we carried out @xmath7-band imaging with wfcam on ukirt @xcite",
    ". the sky was mostly photometric throughout the run .",
    "however , the seeing condition was poor and the fwhm of stellar images was @xmath21 arcsec .",
    "reduction of all the data was performed in a standard manner .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] summarizes the observation dates , total exposure times and limiting magnitudes .",
    "the limiting magnitude is evaluated as a @xmath22 limit in 2 arcsec apertures , which is derived from a flux distribution within 2 arcsec apertures randomly placed on each image .",
    "photometric zero - points were determined from standard stars observed during the run ( @xmath18 ) and from the 2mass data ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we shifted the zero - points of the optical data ( @xmath23 mag . )",
    "so that colours of the stars in our field match those from @xcite .",
    "galactic extinction is corrected using the dust map from @xcite .",
    "we use sextractor @xcite to extract galaxies from our combined images .",
    "object detection is performed in the @xmath6-band , which is much cleaner ( much less artifacts ) and slightly deeper than the @xmath7-band image for red galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "we then limit the catalogue to @xmath25 ( 5@xmath26 ) to approximate a stellar - mass limited sample .",
    "star - galaxy separation is performed on the @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 diagram .",
    "we do not smooth the optical images to match the relatively bad seeing sizes in the ukirt data .",
    "instead , we use kron magnitudes ( mag_auto ) for both total magnitudes and colours , rather than those measured in a fixed aperture size .    .",
    "observation log .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( @xmath29 ) are evaluated as a 5@xmath26 limit in 2 arcsec aperture .",
    "the exposures are not uniform across the wfcam and sofi fields , and the values quoted below are averages . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "figs . [ fig : composite_cmd ] and [ fig : lf ] provide strong evidence for down - sizing in star formation activities of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the population of galaxies that host active star formation activities is progressively shifted to lower mass galaxies with time .",
    "this drives the build - up of the cmr from the bright end to the faint end .",
    "the faint end of the cmrs in the clumps is still under construction at @xmath30 , and will be built - up later at lower redshifts as observed in @xcite .",
    "we also find that the cmr build - up depends on environment .",
    "the poor ( i.e. , low - mass ) clumps show the sharp truncation of the cmr , while the main cluster does not .",
    "therefore , the cmr build - up is delayed in poor systems .",
    "this is consistent with our previous finding ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "all these results lead us to suggest that galaxies follow the environment - dependent down - sizing evolution .",
    "massive galaxies in dense environments stop forming stars at early times and become red .",
    "less massive galaxies in less dense environments continue to form stars at later times and they get red at lower redshifts .",
    "it is interesting to note that the main cluster itself shows a hint of the deficit of faint red galaxies compared to local clusters ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the faint end of the main cluster cmr is possibly still under construction , although the clear cmr is already established .",
    "it is interesting to examine how the magnitude at which the cmr is truncated changes with time .",
    "@xcite found that the cmr disappears at @xmath31 in @xmath32 groups .",
    "they also found that galaxies in @xmath33 groups form a tight cmr down to @xmath34 and it possibly extends to fainter magnitudes .",
    "assuming that the clumps we discover are the progenitors of the @xmath33 and 0.8 groups , the passive evolution model ( @xmath35 ) predicts that the galaxies with @xmath36 at @xmath37 and those with @xmath34 at @xmath38 would appear @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we find in this paper that the cmr in the clumps at @xmath24 is sharply truncated at @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : composite_cmd ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that the truncation magnitude gets fainter at lower redshifts .",
    "we linearly fit the brightening of the truncation magnitude as a function of look - back time over @xmath41 ( we assume that the @xmath33 cmr is truncated at @xmath34 ) .",
    "if we could extrapolate this relation to higher redshifts , we would see further brightening in the truncation magnitude by 2 mags . at @xmath13 , meaning that the cmr would eventually disappear even at the brightest - end .",
    "this epoch ( @xmath13 ) coincides with the formation redshift of the red galaxies in the main cluster inferred from the cmr @xcite .",
    "we admit that the assumptions we have made here are not necessarily valid .",
    "for example , we have assumed that the @xmath33 cmr is truncated at @xmath34 , but it may extends to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the predicted redshift @xmath13 at which the brightest end of the cmr appears should be regarded as an upper limit  if the @xmath33 cmr extends fainter than @xmath34 , then the truncation magnitude gets fainter more rapidly with time and the cmr would appear at lower redshifts than @xmath42 .",
    "another concern is that galaxies in the @xmath30 clumps may not be the progenitors of those seen in the @xmath32 and 0.5 groups and therefore they may not lie on the same evolutionary track .",
    "we should somehow establish a robust evolutionary link of galaxies in different environments at different redshifts in a statistical way to further discuss the evolution of the truncation magnitude and reach a firm conclusion .",
    "this will eventually be achieved with intensive spectroscopic observations with the coming near - ir facilities ( e.g. , fmos ; @xcite ) and with a help of numerical simulations that predict the assembly history of clusters ( e.g. millennium run ; @xcite ) .",
    "we carried out wide - field multi - band imaging of rdcsj1252 at @xmath1 . taking advantage of the multi - band data , we apply the photometric redshift technique to reduce the foreground and background contamination .",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 galaxies reveals clumpy structures surrounding the central cluster .",
    "we see a chain of clumps towards the nne direction extending over 15 mpc .",
    "there are a few more clumps located at ene and wsw of the main cluster .",
    "no such clumps are seen at nw and se of the main cluster .",
    "it seems there is a large ( @xmath9 mpc ) filamentary structure extending in the ne - sw direction .",
    "we compare the galaxy distribution with deep x - ray imaging and find that some of the clumps show significant x - ray emissions . together with the concentrations of red galaxies in the clumps , it is strongly suggested that they are physically bound systems .    following the discovery of the possible large - scale structure , we carried out the deep sofi imaging of the four plausible clumps . a close inspection of the cmr of red galaxies in the clumps revealed that some of them may lie at slightly lower redshift than the cluster redshift ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , because of the limited accuracy of the redshifts derived from cmrs , spectroscopic follow - up observations are essential to confirm the physical clustering of the individual clumps and their physical association to the main body of the cluster .    we make the composite cmd of the four clumps .",
    "we find that the cmr is sharply truncated at @xmath11 .",
    "few faint red galaxies reside in the clumps .",
    "the deficit of faint red galaxies is quantified with the lf of the red galaxies .",
    "the lf shows a prominent break at @xmath11 and the number of red galaxies sharply decreases at fainter magnitudes .",
    "in contrast , the main cluster shows a clear cmr down to fainter magnitude of @xmath44 @xcite and its red lf does not show any deficit of faint red galaxies . from these findings and by comparing with lower redshift systems , we suggest that ( 1 ) the cmr first appears at bright magnitudes and extends to fainter magnitude at later times , and ( 2 ) the build - up of the cmr is delayed in lower - mass systems .",
    "we therefore suggest that galaxies follow the environment - dependent down - sizing evolution .",
    "massive galaxies in high density environments first stop forming stars and get red .",
    "less massive galaxies in less dense environments become red at lower redshifts .",
    "based on a few assumptions , we predict that the first appearance of the cmr in galaxy groups will be observed at @xmath13 .",
