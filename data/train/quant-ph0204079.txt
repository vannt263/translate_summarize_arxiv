    "seeking to bridge the conceptual frameworks of classical and quantum theory , blanchard and jadczyk @xcite have proposed an extension of standard ( non - relativistic ) quantum mechanics called event - enhanced quantum theory ( eeqt ) .",
    "its main idea is to view the total system as consisting of a classical and a quantum part which are coupled .",
    "the pure states of the quantum part are wave functions which are not directly observable , whereas the pure states of the classical part can be observed without disturbing them",
    ". changes of the classical pure states are called events .",
    "events are discrete and irreversible .",
    "a review about applications of eeqt is for example @xcite .",
    "trying to define states and a reduction postulate in a relativistic theory can lead to paradoxes and logical difficulties ( for example see y. aharonov and d.z .",
    "albert @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility to avoid some of these difficulties is to consider the wave function for relativistic particle not as a function on the space - time continuum but as a function on the set of flat , space - like hypersurfaces in minkowski space ( for example see the papers by breuer and petruccione @xcite ) .    another possibility is the introduction of a supplementary , intrinsic time , the proper time @xmath1 .",
    "the proper time @xmath1 is independent of the reference frame .",
    "it plays the role of ( absolute ) time in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea of a proper time was first used physically by horwitz and piron @xcite and later in a lot of other approaches ( a review with more references is for example written by fanchi @xcite ) .",
    "blanchard and jadczyk have also introduced a relativistic version of eeqt @xcite using the idea of a proper time and an indefinite scalar product .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present an alternative relativistic version of eeqt which uses a positive - definite scalar product .",
    "the theory will describe a single spin @xmath0 particle with mass @xmath2 in a relativistic way and should be useful in situations in which one can neglect pair - creation and pair - annihilation . as in the relativistic extension introduced by blanchard and jadczyk @xcite ,",
    "we postulate an additional parameter , called proper time @xmath1 .",
    "the total system consists of a classical and a quantum part .",
    "therefore , at a given proper time @xmath1 , the ( pure ) state of the total system is a pair @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the state of the classical part and @xmath5 is the state of the quantum part .",
    "we assume that a ( pure ) state @xmath4 of the classical part is a number : @xmath6 .",
    "again , a change of the classical ( pure ) state is called an `` event ''",
    ".    the ( pure ) states of the quantum part shall be ( heuristically spoken ) solutions @xmath7 of the dirac - equation @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting property of a quantum state is that it is uniquely given by its values on a spacelike hyperplane .",
    "moreover , it will be possible to introduce a positive - definite scalar product between two quantum states . in the second section of this paper",
    ", we will present the definition of ( pure ) states of the quantum part and their properties in a more mathematical way .",
    "we define in the third section how the system state changes if we change the reference frame or `` charge conjugate '' the system .    in the forth section , we postulate a covariant algorithm for simulating ideal measurements of infinitesimally small duration .",
    "it plays the role of the standard reduction postulate in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "an algorithm for simulating detections of the particle is presented and examined in the fifth section .    in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the properties of our formalism .    in a future paper",
    ", we will examine applications of our algorithm for simulating detections .",

    "an important property of a quantum state @xmath5 is that it is uniquely given by its projection onto a spacelike hyperplane .",
    "the advantage of a positive - definite scalar product must be paid for with a more complicated hilbert space compared to the relativistic extension of blanchard and jadczyk @xcite . in that extension ,",
    "the hilbert space is simpler but they use an indefinite scalar product",

    "we have shown that the non - relativistic limit of this algorithm reduces to the pdp algorithm of the non - relativistic eeqt .    moreover , we have shown that both algorithms are invariant by charge conjugation .",
    "we want to end this paper with a summary of the properties of an event in our theory : an event is a change of the ( pure ) state of the classical part happened at a proper time .",
    "an event can be observed without disturbing it .",
    "we demand that each event be associated with a point in space - time . in general , if an event happens , the quantum state changes simultaneously and instantaneously over the whole space - time .",
    "we do not want to include the principle of relativistic causality explicitly in our formalism : we even allow that an event can happen in the past of the previous ( concerning proper time ) event .",
    "but we want to preserve a weak kind of order , so we demand the following : no event ( e.g. preparation , measurement , or detection ) can be created in a space - time point which lies in the backward light - cone of that space - time point which is associated with the previously ( concerning proper time ) created event .",
    "all these demands are fulfilled by the events generated by our algorithms ."
