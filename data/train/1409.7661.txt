    "in the recent years conformation of the polymers inside confined structures has been investigated widely @xcite .",
    "a category of these studies is polymer packaging in which a polymer chain is encapsulated inside a confined space .",
    "the examples of these highly confined structures are naturally found in viral capsids where a dna strand is packed inside a space comparable to its persistence length .",
    "thus , understanding the structure of a semiflexible chain in such severe confinements and the way the molecule responses to the geometrical constraints may help understand dna function in viral capsids .",
    "many aspects of this phenomenon like the effect of packaging and ejection forces , packaging time , and shape of the confining space on the conformation of the dna ( single strand or double strand ) are studied @xcite .",
    "simulations propose spool like conformation for a semiflexible polymer in the spherical cavity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such structures are also observed in the macroscopic scale in packing of elastic wires in spherical cavities @xcite .",
    "however , spakowitz and wang @xcite have reported toroidal conformations for a dna in a spherical capsid by preventing the release of the twist at the end of the polymer chain .    for polymers in spherical confinement , the bond vectors of the polymer",
    ", the vector along connection of two neighboring beads , tends to be tangent to the surface of the sphere .",
    "then it is proposed that the different configurations of the confined polymers can be understood in an analogy with the nematic order of liquid crystal droplets with planar anchoring  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there is no defect - free structure of tangent lines on the surface of a sphere . according to the poincare - hopf theorem ,",
    "the total charge of the defects is @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities for bipolar defect arrangements with two @xmath1 defects ( spool or polar ) and one tetrahedral of four @xmath2 defects ( tennis ball ) @xcite .",
    "these structures have been reported for confined polymers on the surface of a sphere @xcite , except the polar structure which is not favorable , because of the excluded volume effects .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , zhang and chen have shown that a self avoiding worm - like polymer tends to create tennis ball shapes on a spherical surface  @xcite . in a similar monte",
    "carlo study , angelescu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite show that in the absence of long range electrostatic repulsion , the polymer shows spiral structure on the surface of the sphere , but by applying the long range repulsion , tennis - ball textures become more likely .",
    "recently , oskolkov _",
    "@xcite applied a so - called density functional theory based model and by using nematic ordering concept for a polymer confined inside a sphere , they predicted a spool structure for stiff and long confined polymer chains .",
    "our aim is to study the structure of a confined semiflexible polymer chain with equivalent elastic properties of a double stranded dna in nano - scale spherical cavities .",
    "the observed structures of the confined chain are demonstrated and studied with the nematic order analysis on the surface of the sphere .",
    "in addition to the effect of size of the cavity , we mainly focus on the dynamics of the confining procedure and we show that different dynamical procedures may lead to different structures for the confined polymer chain .",
    "the polymer chain is built based on a coarse grained model for simulation of the dna elasticity @xcite .",
    "the chain is considered as a system of successive rigid objects , where each object represents a base - pair . each base - pair interacts with its nearest neighbors via a harmonic potential :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a vector with 6 components , specifying relative orientation and separation of the adjacent base - pairs .",
    "the rotational ( twist , tilt , and roll ) and translational ( shift , slide and rise ) parameters are defined via cehs representation @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 represents the equilibrium configuration of base - pairs and @xmath6 is a @xmath7 stiffness matrix .    a relatively good set of parameters  @xcite , which carries information from both all - atom molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite and protein - dna crystal structures  @xcite , have been employed here . since in the current study dna",
    "is long enough so that the sequence - dependent effects are averaged out , .",
    "so it is solely required to define one set of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we use the average values of the @xmath6 s for all the ten possible sequence steps and we set all the components of the @xmath5 to be equal to zero except for twist , @xmath8 , and rise , @xmath9 .",
    "the above parameterization has the effect of short range electrostatic interactions implicitly . in the presence of monovalent ions ,",
    "the long range interactions are screened in debye length and they only have a short range contribution in repulsion , such that it affects the excluded volume interactions existing between the base - pairs .",
    "then , in addition to the above harmonic potential , it is required to consider a self avoiding repulsive potential .",
    "this can be accomplished by considering ellipsoidal shape for each base - pair and implementing the repulsive part of the re - squared potential . for two ellipsoids",
    "which interact via this potential we have @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hamaker constant for interaction between beads and @xmath12 is the interaction radius . @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the half - radii of the ellipsoids .",
    "all of these parameters for interaction between the beads are set to the fitted values from an ellipsoidal rigid base - pair model of dna @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is the least distance between the two ellipsoids which is found by gay - berne approximation @xcite . @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "depend on the orientation and separation of the ellipsoids and are calculated from two diagonal tensors , the structure tensor @xmath19 , and the relative well - depth tensor @xmath20 as @xmath21 and @xmath22/\\sigma _ 1 ^ 2+det[\\mathbf{s}_2]/\\sigma _ 2 ^ 2}{[det[\\mathbf{h}_{12}]/(\\sigma _ 1 + \\sigma _ 2)]^{1/2}},\\ ] ] here @xmath23 , where @xmath24 s are the local orientational tensor of the @xmath25 ellipsoid and @xmath26 is the relative position vector of the center of ellipsoids .",
    "the tensors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30    in the simulation this repulsive potential is only considered between those base - pairs which are separated from each other by more than 15 base - pairs along the chain . for the base - pairs which are closer to each other , the elastic energy cost , @xmath31 , would play the role of self avoiding .    the spherical shell which confines the semiflexible chain",
    "is modeled by 1026 spherical particles with diameter of @xmath32 , distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere .",
    "the interaction between ellipsoids and spherical surface is also considered to be repulsive re - squared potential with the same hamaker constant , @xmath33 , and the interaction radius between them is supposed to be @xmath34 .",
    "simulations are done through rigid body dynamics for the ellipsoidal beads and integrating the equations of motion using a symplectic algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the mass of each base - pair is distributed uniformly in a geometry given in @xcite to find the corresponding moment of inertia .",
    "the repulsive forces and torques corresponding to re - squared potential are calculated analytically @xcite . for the elastic part of the potential , @xmath31 ,",
    "forces are calculated analytically but the torques are calculated by the method of virtual work based on exerting small virtual rotations on each base - pair on three mutually perpendicular directions @xcite .",
    "the spherical nodes of the shell are fixed and have been excluded from the integration .",
    "the simulations are done in nvt ensemble at room temperature ( @xmath35  k ) and the temperature is controlled by nose - hoover chain thermostat during the simulations .",
    "we studied conformations of a confined semiflexible chain with two different procedures .",
    "the first one is a radial contraction of the shell as shown schematically in the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] . at the beginning",
    "we generate a thermalized free chain of base - pairs by monte carlo method .",
    "this is achieved by picking the values of the base - pair step parameters from a gaussian distribution according to the boltzmann statistics .",
    "this sampling method helps us to obtain the equilibrium state of a long chain with a very short computational cost . after this step",
    ", the relaxed chain is located inside a spherical shell .",
    "the initial diameter of the shell is considered to be 1.1 times larger than the largest distance between the base - pairs along the relaxed chain .",
    "starting the contraction of the shell , the radius of the shell is reduced regularly at each md time step by a constant rate of about @xmath36 per timestep .",
    "the contraction is continued until the shell reaches its desired radius . after that the contraction is stopped and the system is equilibrated with performing md while the shell radius is fixed .",
    "then the conformation of the chain is sampled for time averaging and further investigations .",
    "the procedure is done for two given values of final radii , @xmath37 and @xmath38  nm .",
    "the final diameter of the spheres are approximately @xmath39 to @xmath40 times smaller than dna persistence length which is roughly @xmath41  nm in our model .",
    "this will lead to a significant elastic energy cost for the polymer chain .    in the other approach we package the chain by injecting it into a spherical shell with a fixed radius .",
    "a hole is set on the shell surface by removing a few particles from the shell ( 5 and 12 particles for @xmath37 and @xmath38  nm spheres respectively ) .",
    "again we begin with a chain of relaxed base - pairs , generated by monte carlo sampling .",
    "this time we insert the head of the polymer chain into the hole in a way that the first 3 base - pairs are located in the capsid initially .",
    "the chain is equilibrated at room temperature while its head is kept fixed . after this step",
    "a radial force of 50 pn toward the centers of the sphere is exerted on the center of the mass of all the base - pairs which are located in a cylindrical region of radius @xmath42  nm and height of @xmath43  nm above the hole .",
    "the force injects the chain inside the shell .",
    "the magnitude of the force is chosen to be close to the reported forces in the packaging process of dna inside @xmath44 and @xmath45 bacteriophages @xcite .",
    "as soon as the packaging process is completed , the system is equilibrated and then sampled for conformational analyses .",
    "we have done the packaging simulation for two given radii of the sphere as well . for both confinement scenarios",
    ", we repeated the simulations for 20 different realizations ( 10 for each sphere size ) for a chain of 1000 base - pairs .",
    "some movies from both confinement methods are available via this link http://softmatter.cscm.ir/polymer-confinement/index.htm .",
    "in order to estimate [ packaging - number ] [ capacity ] .",
    "the ultimate amount of the packed chain with this diameter is about 1070 - 1170 base - pairs for this setup .",
    "so choosing a chain with 1000 base - pairs allows us to obtain about @xmath46 of the ultimate capacity at @xmath37 nm sphere size .",
    "another fact which can be seen from one simulation of packaging of the polymer with diameter of @xmath47 nm ( figure [ packaging - number ] ) is that for the first 1000 base - pairs of the packed chain , the packaging rate is almost constant ( the graph is linear ) and after that , there is a crossover and the packaging process slows down .",
    "indeed , the next 150 base - pairs are packed in almost the same simulation time as for the first 1000 base - pairs .",
    "so by choosing a chain with 1000 base - pairs in length , the simulations do still remain fast enough to reduce the computational costs while a nearly full ( @xmath46 ) capsid is achieved . from the table",
    "[ capacity ] , one can observe that just about @xmath48 percent of the volume is filled by the 1000 base - pairs polymer chain .     for different polymer thicknesses .",
    ", width=340 ]    .the capacity of spheres for 3 values of polymer diameter ( d ) [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ energies ]    to be sure that the results are not subjected by the confinement rate , the above presented simulations are also performed with slower procedures . in radial contraction ,",
    "the confining rate has been slowed down by a factor of 4 and for insertion packaging , the packaging forces of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51  pn have been tried . in either method",
    "no significant differences in results have been observed for slower dynamics . on the other hand , when we make the process faster some changes in configurations are observed , while the distribution of the base - pairs inside the spheres remains almost the same as before with onion - shell structure .",
    "figure  [ fast - confinement ] compares distribution of base - pairs inside @xmath37  nm sphere for three different rates of confinement . for the radial contraction ( figure  [ fast - confinement]a )",
    "solid curve shows the distribution of the base - pairs with rate of @xmath36 and the contraction rates of dot - dashed and dotted curves are two and four times faster . for packaging simulation we double and triple packaging force ( dot - dashed and solid lines in figure  [ fast - confinement]b ) .",
    "as it can be seen , in either case the onion - like structures of density distribution are preserved and they only differ in the center . regarding the structures , in the radial contraction the tennis - ball conformation is still observed , although the structure becomes less regular at high contraction rates ( see the figure [ fast - confinement]a insets ) .",
    "on the contrary , in the packaging with high packaging forces , the spool - like configuration is the dominant configuration .",
    "formation of the circles of the polymer in packaging at small sizes requires spending much more energy .",
    "this energy can not be achieved unless the insertion force becomes large enough .",
    "so in small capsids with small packaging forces the tennis ball conformation is the preferred structure , but by increasing the forces the conformation transforms to the spool - like structure ( see the figure[fast - confinement]b insets ) .",
    "two movies from packaging with 50 pn and 100 pn injection forces are available via this link http://softmatter.cscm.ir/polymer-confinement/index.htm .     times ( dot - dashed brown ) and @xmath52 times ( dashed pink ) faster than the reported rate of @xmath36 ( solid green ) .",
    "( b ) compares packaging by 100 pn ( dot - dashed pink ) and 150 pn ( solid blue ) insertion forces in @xmath53 sphere with @xmath54  pn ( dashed red ) .",
    "the corresponding conformations of fast processes are shown schematically as insets.,width=264 ]",
    "for a dna chain , the electrostatic interaction due to the negatively charged phosphate groups along the dna chain affects its properties in several ways .",
    "one part of this effect on the dna elastic parameters is already included in the elastic potential parameters of neighboring base - pairs ( equation [ harmonic - potential])employed in this study .",
    "but in the presence of the multivalent counterions , this interaction may transform into an attraction between two dna double strands @xcite.in the simulations of dna packaging , this effect is usually considered as a short range interaction between the base - pairs @xcite . the elastic part of the energy usually dominates over the electrostatic part in determining the structure of dna inside the capsid @xcite .",
    "however , to show that our results can be applicable to the dna packaging problem , here we will examine the effect of electrostatic attraction in our model by introducing a short range attractive potential . in the rigid base - pair chain model that the phosphate groups are absent , this short range attraction between the phosphates can be approximated with a van der waals potential between the end points of the base - pairs ( see figure [ electrostatic ] . ) :    @xmath55        in the above equation , @xmath56 s are the distances between the end points and @xmath57 .",
    "for the depth of the potential , @xmath58 , usually a range between 0.4 - 0.8 @xmath59 have been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the above potential acts on every two base - pairs that at least have one @xmath56 inside the cutoff ( @xmath60 ) . to see whether this interaction may affect the dynamics of the confinement in our study",
    ", we set up simulations with the attraction energy according to equation [ lj ] with two @xmath58 values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . a sample of the obtained conformations is shown in figure [ attractive ] for sphere size of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as it is shown , this attraction is not strong enough to have an influence on the dynamics of confinement and change the chain conformation .",
    "still the tennis - ball structure is the favored structure in the radial contraction and also a signature of this structure can be observed in the packaging at this sphere size .",
    "calculations of the energies show that the total attractive energies of the confined dna chains for @xmath65 and @xmath64 are about @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the attraction energy acts against the bending energy , holds the dna close together and consequently , reduces the pressure on the sphere s surface .",
    "although the attractive energy does not have a significant effect on the dna conformation and dynamics in our study , this effect can play a role on the stability of the structure .     in a sphere with @xmath53 radius.,width=226 ]",
    "the current study of the confined semiflexible polymer chains in a sphere , proposed some new interesting aspects of conformation of the polymers in extreme confinements . using a coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation , we studied two different dynamical procedures for confining the polymer chain inside spheres of two different sizes .",
    "although the scales of the confinement in our studies are smaller than usual viral capsid sizes , the results can be helpful to understand dna structure inside viral capsids . in summary , our study proposes that the conformation of a semiflexible chain in spherical confinement significantly depend on the dynamics of the confinement and confining procedure .",
    "different dynamics or different rates of confinement leaded to different conformation for the chain .",
    "we mostly focused on the conformation of dna near the surface of the sphere .    in the radial contraction procedure ,",
    "the tennis ball structures are the dominant observed conformation for the confined chain in nanometer sized capsids .",
    "even though the spool conformation sometimes observed in the sphere of @xmath38  nm radius , by resuming the contraction procedure these structures tend to the tennis ball because of buckling of the polymer chain circles .    in the packaging procedure for @xmath38",
    "nm sphere size mostly leaded to the unarranged or mixed conformations but in a few simulations a weak signature of the spool structure observed .",
    "however , the tennis ball structure has never been reported in this sphere scale .",
    "like the radial contraction , in @xmath53 sphere the tennis ball structure were the most observed structure , although , higher excitations have been observed .",
    "@xcite ,    iit was shown that applying a short ranged interaction between the base - pairs due to the electrostatic effect of counterions on the phosphates of the dna chain does not affect its structure in confinement while can be important on the stability of the structure and capsid . also increasing the packaging force changes the packaging mechanism and pushs the chain to form the spool structures .",
