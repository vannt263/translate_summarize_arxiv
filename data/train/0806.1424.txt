    "we show how we can use these constructions in regard to the existence or non - existence of einstein metrics .",
    "lebrun and catanese @xcite showed that there exist homeomorphic , but non - diffeo - morphic manifolds such that one of them admits an einstein metric of positive sign while the other admits an einstein metric of negative sign .",
    "the manifold which has positive scalar curvature einstein metric is @xmath5 while the second manifold is a deformation of the barlow surface .",
    "the key ingredient in their proof was to show that the barlow surface , a simply connected minimal surface of general type with @xmath6 can be deformed to a surface with ample canonical bundle .",
    "in particular , they showed that there exists a simply connected complex surface of general type with @xmath7 and having ample canonical bundle .",
    "the ampleness of the canonical bundle ensures the existence of a khler - einstein metric of negative scalar curvature .",
    "based on ideas from @xcite , lee and park @xcite and more recently park , park , and shin @xcite constructed new examples of simply connected , minimal surfaces of general type with @xmath8 or @xmath9 we show that their examples satisfy the ampleness condition :    [ amplu ] there exist simply connected complex surfaces of general type , with @xmath10 or @xmath11 and ample canonical bundle .",
    "in his paper , park @xcite , used his examples and lebrun s obstruction theorem to exhibit a manifold homeomorphic , non - diffeomorphic to @xmath12 which does not admit an einstein metric .",
    "we extend his results to @xmath13 and we also exhibit an infinite family of homeomorphic manifolds for which no einstein metric exists .",
    "[ einstein ] each of the topological 4-manifolds @xmath0 for @xmath14 admits a smooth structure which has an einstein metric of scalar curvature @xmath2 , a smooth structure which has an einstein metric with @xmath3 and infinitely many non - diffeomorphic smooth structures which do not admit einstein metrics .",
    "we can also prove non - existence results for an even smaller topological manifold :    [ 5-blow - ups ] the canonical smooth structure on @xmath15 admits an einstein metric of positive scalar curvature , but @xmath16 also supports infinitely many exotic smooth structures which do nt have an einstein metric .",
    "it is a well known fact that in dimensions @xmath17 and @xmath18 the sign of the einstein metric is a topological invariant .",
    "this led besse @xcite to consider the conjecture that no smooth compact @xmath19manifold can admit einstein metrics with different scalar curvature signs .",

    "these examples are in dimensions @xmath22 where @xmath23 in these dimensions , we are able to provide many new examples with the same property :    [ high ] let @xmath24 then the manifold @xmath25 obtained by taking the @xmath26fold products , @xmath27 of arbitrary @xmath28 or @xmath29 , admits two einstein metrics @xmath30 such that the signs of the scalar curvature are @xmath31 moreover , these metrics are khler - einstein with respect to two distinct complex structues @xmath32    as a consequence of the khlerian property of the metrics and of our method of construction , we have the following in peculiar fact : their corresponding volumes are equal @xmath33    [ rmk ] soon after this paper was finished , jongil park and his collaborators found @xcite an analogous example of a complex surface of general type homeomorphic to @xmath34 using this construction the results of theorems [ amplu ] , [ einstein ] and proposition [ high ] can be extended for @xmath34    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ ampl ] we discuss the ampleness of the canonical line bundles of some interesting examples of complex surfaces and the relation to the existence of einstein metrics , while in section [ exot ] we introduce the seiberg - witten invariants and use them to get results on non - existence of einstein metrics . in section",
    "[ high ] we treat the higher dimensional case .",
    "in general the existence or non - existence of einstein metrics on a given manifold is hard to prove . in the case @xmath35 in the unobstructed situations , i.e. for certain complex surfaces whose underlying differential structure is @xmath36 the existence of khler - einstein metrics was proved by siu @xcite , or tian and yau @xcite . a complete solution to the existence",
    "was given by tian @xcite :    [ tian ] a compact complex surface @xmath37 admits a compatible khler - einstein metric with @xmath38 if and only if its anti - canonical line bundle @xmath39 is ample and its lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields is reductive .    in the case when @xmath40 a criterion for the existence of a khler - einstein metric was independently found by aubin @xcite and yau @xcite :    [ ay ]",
    "a compact complex manifold @xmath37 admits a compatible khler - einstein metric with @xmath41 if and only if its canonical line bundle @xmath42 is ample .",
    "when such a metric exists , it is unique , up to an overall multiplicative constant .    in this section , we discuss some examples of smooth structures on @xmath43 for each such @xmath44 the natural smooth structure as the complex projective plane blown - up at @xmath45 generic points , can be endowed @xcite by a khler - einstein metric of positive scalar curvature . on the other hand , lee and park @xcite and",
    "more recently park , park and shin @xcite constructed new exotic smooth structures on @xmath46 for any @xmath47 moreover , these admit complex structures yielding interesting examples of minimal surfaces of general type .",
    "we are going to prove that the canonical bundle of these surfaces is ample , and so they admit khler - einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature .",
    "the examples constructed in these papers are very similar . in this article",
    "we are going to treat just the more complicated example @xcite of a simply connected minimal surface of general type with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the other examples follow similarly .",
    "we begin by a brief description of the example of a minimal surface of general type with @xmath48 and @xmath50 referring frequently to @xcite .",
    "we start with an appropriate pencil of plane elliptic curves , and we resolve the base locus to obtain a rational elliptic surface @xmath51 with the following set of singular fibers : one @xmath52fiber , one reducible @xmath53fiber and two nodal fibers . moreover , this rational elliptic surface admits 4 sections .",
    "now , @xmath51 is blown - up 21 times at well chosen points to obtain a new rational surface @xmath54 these points can be chosen in such a way @xcite that @xmath55 contains four particular disjoint chains of rational curves consisting of proper transforms of the singular fibers , proper transform of some sections and some of the exceptional divisors introduced in the blowing - up process . according to @xcite ,",
    "these chains are @xmath56 and a chain of length one denoted by @xmath57 these chains are represented by continuous lines in figure [ figure ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    they all satisfy artin s contractibility criterion @xcite . by contracting them ,",
    "we obtain a projective surface @xmath58 with 4 singularities , each admitting 1-parameter @xmath59gorenstein smoothings .",
    "let @xmath60 be the contraction map .",
    "now , it is proved @xcite that the projective surface @xmath58 admits a @xmath59gorenstein smoothing , which is a smooth , simply - connected , minimal surface of general type with @xmath61 we denote by @xmath62 the seven smooth rational curves of self - intersection @xmath63 which are marked by discontinuous lines in figure [ figure ] and by @xmath64 the remaining exceptional divisor from the last singular fiber , drawn as a dotted line .",
    "it is easy to see that the poincar duals of the curves @xmath65 together with all of the irreducible components of our 4 chains @xmath66 and @xmath67 form a basis of @xmath68 which is torsion - free and 31-dimensional .",
    "first , we prove the ampleness of the canonical divisor of the singular surface @xmath69 note that since @xmath58 has only 1-parameter @xmath59gorenstein smoothing singularities , its canonical divisor is in fact @xmath59cartier .",
    "a common feature of all of the examples appearing in @xcite is that the pullback of the canonical divisor of the singular variety @xmath58 to its minimal resolution is effective .",
    "for instance , in the example described above , we can write : @xmath70 in @xcite , the coefficients are explicitely given , but for our purpose it is important to know only that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are strictly positive rational numbers .",
    "for convenience , let @xmath73 denote the exceptional divisor of @xmath74    by a direct computation , in @xcite it is proved that @xmath75 and the nefness of @xmath76 suppose now that @xmath77 fails to be ample . since @xmath77 is already nef , according to the nakai - moishezon criterion @xcite",
    ", there exists an irreducible curve @xmath78 such that @xmath79    the total transform of @xmath80 in @xmath55 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the strict transform and @xmath83 are non - negative rational numbers .",
    "we should note here that @xmath82 is not numerically equivalent to @xmath84 to give an immediate proof for this assertion , note that @xmath85 for any ample line bundle @xmath86 on the projective surface @xmath69 but , if @xmath87 we would have @xmath88 and this is a contradiction .",
    "now , a straightforward computation gives : @xmath89 now , obviously the intersection number of @xmath82 with any component of @xmath90 is greater or equal to @xmath91 with equality if and only if @xmath82 does not intersect any of the irreducible components of @xmath92 i.e. @xmath80 does not pass through the singular points of @xmath69 hence , it follows that @xmath93    thus @xmath94 in this case , either there is an @xmath95 such that @xmath96 or @xmath97 for all @xmath98 and @xmath82 does not meet any component of @xmath99 in the first case @xmath82 must coincide with @xmath100 but the computations in @xcite show that @xmath101 for all @xmath98 which is impossible by our assumption",
    ". therefore @xmath82 must have vanishing intersection number with all of the @xmath102 s and also with the all of the components of @xmath99 but , as the poincar duals of the irreducible components of @xmath90 and of the @xmath103s generate @xmath104 must be numerically trivial on @xmath105 and this is a contradiction .",
    "hence , @xmath58 has ample canonical bundle .    as a consequence of theorem [ ay ] we get :",
    "[ ample ] there exist smooth complex structures on @xmath0 for @xmath14 which have ample canonical line bundles and hence admitting khler - einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature .",
    "as we have already mentioned earlier , we only discuss the case of @xmath106 the other cases follow similarly .",
    "we know that a @xmath59gorenstein smoothing of @xmath58 exists @xcite and gives a smooth exotic structure on @xmath106 as we showed , the singular projective surface @xmath58 has ample @xmath59 cartier canonical divisor .",
    "but , ampleness is an open property @xcite , so the canonical bundle of these smoothings is automatically ample .",
    "this will allow us now to apply aubin - yau s theorem [ ay ] to prove the existence of khler - einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature on the minimal surfaces of general type described above .",
    "[ barlow ] the examples of complex surfaces with ample canonical bundle we found are new to our knowledge , when @xmath107 or @xmath9 when @xmath108 lebrun and catanese @xcite were able to find a complex surface with ample canonical bundle homeomorphic to @xmath109 as a deformation of the barlow surface . as was pointed out by @xcite , it is not known whether the surfaces we found in corollary [ ample ] are deformation equivalent to the barlow surface , or even diffeomorphic to it .",
    "the classical obstruction to the existence of an einstein metric on an oriented , compact , smooth , riemannian , four - manifold @xmath110 is the hitchin - thorpe inequality : @xmath111 with equality when the einstein manifold @xmath110 is covered by the hyperkhler @xmath112 surface or by the flat four - torus , or by the above with the reversed orientations . here",
    "@xmath113 denote the euler characteristic and the signature of the manifold @xmath114 respectively . using the seiberg - witten theory ,",
    "lebrun @xcite was able to find new obstruction to the existence of einstein metrics .",
    "the novelty of his results is that the existence of einstein metrics depends on the differential structure considered .",
    "the techniques developed by lebrun rely on the existence of a non - trivial solution of the seiberg - witten equations .",
    "we briefly introduce the needed notions of the seiberg - witten theory and state the main obstruction theorem .    for simplicity , we consider only the case when @xmath115 has no @xmath116torsion .",
    "then there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of @xmath117 structures and the set @xmath118 of characteristic classes in @xmath119 the seiberg - witten invariant is defined @xcite as an integer valued function @xmath120 we call @xmath121 a basic class if @xmath122    the seiberg - witten invariant is a diffeomorphism invariant in the case @xmath123 in the case of @xmath124 the invariant depends on the choice of an orientation of @xmath125 and @xmath126 but , as we are interested in manifolds for which the existence of an einstein metric is topologically unobstructed , the inequality ( [ ht ] ) must be strictly satisfied .",
    "hence , in the case when the @xmath127 we have @xmath128 but for any arbitrary metric @xmath129 where we denote by @xmath130 the ( anti)-self - dual part of the harmonic representative 2-form .",
    "thus @xmath131 and in this special situation ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we will use a construction due to akhmedov , baykur and park @xcite .",
    "similar results could also be found in papers of above authors or of baldridge and kirk .",

    "* section 3.4 ) , the authors construct a minimal symplectic manifold @xmath58 homeomorphic to @xmath114 but not diffeomorphic . to give the reader a better understanding of this new manifold , we sketch its construction .",
    "we start with two product manifolds @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a torus of dimension @xmath139 and @xmath140 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath141 if we consider the diagonal class @xmath142 + [ point\\times t^2]\\in h_2(t^4,\\zz),$ ] then a smooth representative in this class is a riemann surface of genus @xmath17 with self - intersection @xmath141 blowing up two points on the smooth representative gives @xmath143 a smooth riemann surface of genus @xmath17 and @xmath144self - intersection .",
    "if we endow the manifolds @xmath51 and @xmath145 with the canonical symplectic structures , we can choose the representative @xmath146 to be a symplectic submanifold .",
    "we can now take the symplectic sum @xmath147 along the two genus @xmath17 symplectic submanifolds @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xmath150 is a symplectic manifold with topological invariants : euler characteristic @xmath151 and signature @xmath152 as @xmath150 is not simply connected we need to make six luttinger surgeries along well chosen tori ( see @xcite ) , which yield a new simply connected , minimal , symplectic manifold @xmath153 with the same topological invariants as @xmath154 notice that the definition of the seiberg - witten invariant in @xcite is for the poincar dual of the characteristic class .",
    "the results are nevertheless the same .",
    "the manifold @xmath58 has a unique basic class @xmath155 such that its seiberg - witten invariant @xmath156 moreover , @xmath58 contains a null - homologous torus @xmath157 with a preferred simple loop @xmath158 in section 4 , @xcite , it is shown that @xmath144surgery on @xmath159 with respect to @xmath160 yields a symplectic manifold @xmath161 which also has an unique basic class @xmath162 then @xmath163surgery@xmath164 on @xmath159 with respect to @xmath160 generates a family of manifolds @xmath165 which are homeomorphic to @xmath166 corresponding to the basic class @xmath167 of @xmath58 there is a unique basic class @xmath168 of @xmath165 for which the seiberg - witten invariant is non - zero , and it can be computed as follows : @xmath169 hence , the family @xmath170 consists of homeomorphic , pairwise non - diffeomorphic manifolds .",
    "as @xmath171 is the unique basic class on @xmath172 and the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath173 is not @xmath174 the manifold @xmath165 does not admit a symplectic structure .",
    "of course , its basic class satisfies @xmath175    let @xmath176 then , the conditions of theorem [ obstr ] are satisfied and we have the following :    [ non - einstein ] the manifolds @xmath177 for @xmath178 support infinitely many non - diffeomorphic exotic smooth structures none of which admits an einstein metric .",
    "the only thing that needs to be argued is that the manifolds @xmath179 are homeomorphic but pairwise not diffeomorphic . for this",
    "we use again the seiberg - witten invariant and the commutativity of our construction .",
    "first we blow - up @xmath180 points on @xmath181 and denote by @xmath182 the exceptional divisors .",

    "moreover , if @xmath190 they do nt support a symplectic structure .",
