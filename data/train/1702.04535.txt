    "the layered transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have been investigated for over fifty years now .",
    "however , recent interest in this class of materials has been spurred by possible applications in nanoelectronics , photovoltaics , catalysis to name a few @xcite .",
    "further advances in the growth of one or more layers @xcite has led to the exploration of the properties of these materials as a function of thickness .",
    "analogous to the nanomaterials where one finds a size dependence of the band gap @xcite , one finds thickness dependent changes in the electronic structure of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides .",
    "additionally one finds a thickness dependent band gap which changes character .",
    "the bulk band gap of mos@xmath0 is found to be an indirect one of 1.3 ev @xcite which increases to 1.6 ev in the bilayer limit @xcite .",
    "the nature of the band gap changes and becomes a direct one of 1.9 ev at the monolayer limit @xcite .",
    "the fact that the monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides have a direct band gap ( with the exception of wse@xmath0 @xcite ) is evident from the sharp peak that one finds in the photoluminescence spectra@xcite .",
    "mose@xmath0 also has an indirect band gap of 1.1 ev @xcite in the bulk limit whereas in the monolayer limit it has direct band gap of about 1.66 ev @xcite .",
    "there could be different types of mx@xmath0 ( m = mo , w , ti etc .",
    ", x = s , se , etc . )",
    "sandwiches depending on the coordination of the transition metal atom with the chalcogens as well as the stacking of atoms @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus our attention on the 2h polymorph of mox@xmath0 ( x = s , se ) where the symmetry about the mo site is trigonal prismatic , though certain generic features are found to be valid across different types of stacking .",
    "the bonding within each monolayer is strongly covalent .",
    "however , the coupling between layers is believed to be due to weak van der waal s interaction .    the size dependence of the band gap in semiconductor quantum dots has been extensively studied and is well understood .",
    "it has been interpreted as arising because the electron and hole wavefunction begin to feel the effects of the boundary and hence a band gap different from what is found in the bulk for these materials .",
    "this has been referred to as quantum confinement effect on the band gap and happens in a size range less than the bohr radius for the material .",
    "consequently , when electronic structure calculations found a thickness dependence of the band gap in transition metal dichalcogenides , this was interpreted as arising due to quantum confinement effects .",
    "this view has prevailed in the community in the absence of any proper quantification .",
    "@xcite fit the _ ab - initio _ band structure for a monolayer of mos@xmath0 to a nearest neighbor tight binding model . using the same parameters within each layer and introducing interactions between the layers , the _ ab - initio _ band structure for bulk mos@xmath0 was fit and the relevant parameters extracted . from this model",
    ", it was inferred that interlayer interactions were responsible for the direct to indirect band gap transition in these materials .",
    "however , only a subset of bands were fit in addition to a very narrow energy window .",
    "the problem with fitting a small subset of bands is that they allow you to arrive at any conclusion you would like .",
    "the issue still does nt seem to be settled . recently",
    "zhang and zunger @xcite examined various aspects of the thickness dependent changes in the electronic structure and arrived at the conclusion that both interlayer interactions as well as quantum confinement effects were responsible for the observed changes .",
    "su - huai wei and coworkers @xcite attributed the transition to the absence of interlayer interactions at k point , a general feature they attributed to the crystal symmetry of hexagonal materials . in view of the differing viewpoints existing in the literature ,",
    "there is a need to reexamine this problem .",
    "the direct band gap originates from a transition from the valence band maximum at k to the conduction band minimum at the same point .",
    "this was found to show a weak dependence on size .",
    "the indirect band gap arises from a transition from the top of the valence band at @xmath1 to the bottom of the conduction band between @xmath1 and k , and exhibits a strong dependence on the number of layers . in order to examine the origin of the observed variations in the band gap with size , padhila",
    "_ @xcite chose an internal reference in each case and monitored the size dependence of the band extrema points .",
    "they found that while the band extrema at k point hardly showed any size dependence , the band extrema at @xmath1 and t showed significant variations with thickness which determined the band gap .",
    "examining the charge density associated with the band extrema at @xmath1 point , they found that they were contributed by orbitals directed out of plane , hence explaining the changes in the position of the band extrema as each additional layer was added .    in this manuscript",
    "we have studied the variation of the band gap in mose@xmath0 as a function of number of layers .",
    "the band structures obtained from _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations are found to reproduce the experimental observation @xcite that this system is a direct band gap semiconductor in the monolayer limit , but as we move to the bilayer , the system becomes an indirect band gap material .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the evolution in the electronic structure of the transition metal dichalcogenides with thickness have been discussed in terms of geometric confinement effects , interlayer interactions with an important role played by crystal symmetry in determining the nature of interactions . in order to understand the role of each of these quantities in bringing about the band gap crossover",
    ", our approach has been to carry out an _ ab - initio _ mapping onto a tight binding model .",
    "this method uses maximally localized wannier functions as its basis functions .",
    "geometric confinement effects are expected to renormalize the onsite energies of the orbitals which are directed into the vacuum as against those orbitals which are in - plane , in line with the belief that these orbitals feel the effect of the boundary .",
    "additionally , one knows that as one builds a solid atom by atom , the onsite energies get renormalized because of the potential felt by the electrons due to the neighboring atoms ( madelung effect ) . as a result",
    "there should be a change in the onsite energies as one went from monolayer to bilayer to trilayer .",
    "the tight binding fittings carried out for monolayer and bilayer are found to have similar onsite energies .",
    "hence one concluded that there was no renormalization of the energies by geometric confinement or madelung potential effects .",
    "the changes in the electronic structure as a function of the number of layers arose from interlayer interactions present when a layer was added to a monolayer . to check this point",
    "we used the tight binding hamiltonian of the bilayer , switched off interlayer interactions and recovered the monolayer band structure , as one would expect .",
    "a similar construction of the trilayer band structure within the tight binding model was carried out using the monolayer hamiltonian for the layers and the interlayer interactions derived from the bilayer hamiltonian .",
    "the electronic structure constructed this way gave perfect match with the _ ab - initio _ band structure .",
    "hence our results showed quantitatively that interlayer interactions were responsible for the changes in the electronic structure that one found as a function of the number of layers , with geometric confinement effects playing a negligible role .",
    "similar conclusions were arrived at for the other transition metal dichalcogenides mx@xmath0 where m = mo , w and x = s , se , te also .",
    "while the 2h stacking was considered in each of the cases listed above , considering alternate stacking did not change the onsite energies . this therefore led us to the rather puzzling conclusion that interlayer interactions dictated the electronic structure changes even in these van de waal s materials .",
    "while the hexagonal symmetry of the lattice is attributed for the absence of interlayer interactions at the k point , we show that it is the character of the bands which determines the presence / absence of interlayer interactions at a symmetry point .",
    "the electronic structure calculations of monolayer , bilayer as well as trilayer mose@xmath0 as well as monolayer and bilayer mos@xmath0 are carried out within a plane wave implementation of density functional theory ( dft ) using the vasp @xcite code .",
    "we have taken the 2h stacking of mose@xmath0 as it is found to be the most stable structure @xcite . while , the lattice constants are kept at the experimental values of @xmath2=3.299  and @xmath3=12.939  for mose@xmath0 @xcite and @xmath2=3.16  and c=12.296  for mos@xmath0 @xcite , all the atoms are allowed to relax through a total energy minimization that is guided by the calculated atomic forces . a vacuum of 20  is used along @xmath4 direction to minimize the interaction among the periodic images .",
    "projected augmented wave @xcite potentials are used to solve the electronic structure self - consistently using a k - points mesh of 12@xmath512 @xmath51 with a cutoff energy for the plane wave basis states equal to 280 ev .",
    "perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite approximation was used for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "there is a weak van der waals interaction between the layers which has an effect in the determination of the interlayer distances .",
    "a dispersion correction based on grimme s dft - d2 method @xcite is used on top of the pbe potentials .    in order to quantify the results , we setup a tight binding model with mo @xmath6 and se @xmath7/s @xmath7 states in the basis . in this model , the maximally localized wannier functions @xcite are used for the radial parts of the basis functions .",
    "technically , the degree of localization and the symmetry of these wannier functions can be controlled in the projection procedure .",
    "all on - site energies and hopping interaction strengths in this case are determined from the interface of vasp to wannier90 @xcite .",
    "apart from the 2h stacking , we also explored other stacking geometries aa , a@xmath8b , ab@xmath8 and ab to explore the renormalization of the onsite energies due to differing madelung potentials .",
    "an explanation for the notation for the stacking may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to generalize our findings",
    ", we did the similar analysis mentioned earlier for mote@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental lattice parameters of a= 3.522 , 3.1532 , 3.282 ,  and c= 13.967 , 12.323 , 12.96 ,  were considered for mote@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 @xcite respectively .",
    "the internal positions were optimized in each case for both monolayer and bilayer .",
    "the van der waals interactions implemented using the dft - d2 method of grimme were considered for positional optimization in the case of bilayer .",
    "the @xmath9 band structure was then calculated for each of these cases and the results for the bilayers were then mapped onto a tight binding model with mo / w @xmath6 and s , se and te @xmath7 orbitals in the basis . the radial part of the tight binding basis functions corresponded to maximally localized wannier functions",
    "the _ ab - initio _ band dispersions for monolayer mose@xmath0 along various symmetry directions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "one finds that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) are both located at k point and the system is a direct band gap semiconductor .",
    "this is consistent with experiment which also finds the system to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a gap of 1.66 ev .",
    "the present calculations which use gga for the exchange correlation functional find a gap of 1.59 ev which is close to the experimental value .",
    "the agreement is however fortuitous as one usually has an underestimation of the band gap due to self - interaction effects among various other approximations which enter the use of the generalized gradient approximation in the absence of an exact exchange correlation functional . in order to quantify the changes in the electronic structure , we have mapped the _ ab - initio _ band structure onto a tight binding model with mo @xmath6 and se @xmath7 states in the basis .",
    "the tight binding band structure shown by red line with circles is superposed on the calculated _ ab - initio _ band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we have a good description of the _ ab - initio _ band structure in the energy window from -3.5 ev to 4 ev .",
    "this gives us confidence in the extracted parameters and allows us to discuss changes in the electronic structure in terms of these parameters .",
    "there are several ways to construct the bilayer of mose@xmath0 .",
    "each monolayer can be visualized as a three atomic layer stacking of mo and se atoms where mo atoms are sandwiched between layers of se atoms .",
    "the se atoms generate a trigonal prismatic crystal field at the mo site .",
    "the stacking that we have considered has the mo atom in one layer above that in the layer beneath .",
    "however , the mo - se motif is rotated by 180@xmath10 in the upper layer with respect to the layer beneath .",
    "this is referred to as the aa@xmath8 stacking and has been shown to have the lowest energy among various stacking patterns considered .    considering a bilayer of mose@xmath0",
    ", we have calculated the band dispersions along various symmetry directions .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we find that the vbm which was at k point has now shifted to @xmath1 .",
    "the cbm is also shifted to t point which lies along the line from @xmath1 to k. this leads to an indirect band gap of 1.25 ev in contrast to the experimental value of 1.55 ev @xcite .",
    "the changeover in the vbm positions can easily be understood by examining the character of the states contributing to this point .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] where we plot the charge density for the highest occupied band at @xmath1 in panel ( a ) .",
    "these are seen to emerge from the interactions between the @xmath11 orbitals on mo and @xmath12 orbitals on se . as these involve orbitals which are directed out of plane",
    ", one finds that these levels in the lower layer interact with the @xmath11/@xmath12 orbitals in the layer above . as a result , the highest occupied band at @xmath1",
    "point moves to higher energies relative to that at k point , and consequently the vbm shifts to @xmath1 point when we move from monolayer to bilayer .",
    "the highest occupied band at the k point is contributed by interactions between in - plane orbitals as is evident from fig .",
    "hence it shows no shift from the bilayer from its position for the monolayer . a similar analysis of the charge density contributing to the lowest unoccupied band at t and",
    "k symmetry points is shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we find that in - plane orbitals contribute to the lowest unoccupied band at k point while out - of - plane orbitals contribute to the lowest unoccupied band at t point .",
    "hence , the increased interaction arising from the presence of the second layer moves t point relative to k point , making the former the conduction band minimum .",
    "these ideas are consistent with the analysis of padhila _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who examined the movement of various band extrema as a function of the number of layers .",
    "while these ideas are qualitative , we map the @xmath9 band structure to a tight binding model and extract the onsite energies and hopping interaction strengths in order to make a more quantitative statement of the role of various effects .",
    "the tight binding band structure is superposed on the _ ab - initio _ band structure calculated for the monolayer in fig.[fig:1 ] and for the bilayer in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the quality of the fit in both cases gives us confidence in the extracted parameters ( table [ onsite ] ) which we use to discuss changes in the electronic structure in going from the monolayer to the bilayer .",
    "the onsite energies for se @xmath7 as well as mo @xmath6 orbitals extracted by the tight binding mapping for monolayer as well as bilayer mose@xmath0 are given in table [ onsite ] .",
    "the energies are similar within deviations associated with the error bars on the energies . hence we can conclude that geometric confinement effects do not modify the onsite energies when one goes from monolayer to bilayer . in order to examine what is it that changes leading to the differences in the electronic structure in going from monolayer to bilayer , we have considered the tight binding hamiltonian for the bilayer .",
    "interlayer interactions have been switched off in this hamiltonian and the ensuing band structure has been plotted along various symmetry directions in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . the band structure for the monolayer",
    "has been superposed for comparison .",
    "the two band structures look almost identical suggesting that the only difference between the electronic structure of the monolayer and that for the bilayer emerge from interlayer interactions .",
    "the dominant interlayer hopping interaction strengths of bilayer mose@xmath0 are between the first nearest neighbor mo-@xmath13 and se-@xmath12 ( 4.88  ) and also between the se-@xmath7 orbitals which are first ( 3.72  ) as well as second ( 5.92  ) neighbors .    in order to examine this hypothesis",
    "further , we constructed a trilayer heterostructure of mose@xmath0 .",
    "the _ ab - initio _ band structure for the trilayer was calculated along various symmetry directions .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . for comparison and to examine the hypothesis made vis - a - vis the origin of the changes in the electronic structure as each layer is added , we set up the tight binding hamiltonian for the trilayer .",
    "this was done by considering the hamiltonian for the monolayer for each of the layers .",
    "the interlayer interactions extracted for the bilayer were then used to couple the layers .",
    "the band structure calculated within this model is superposed on the _ ab - initio _ band structure for the trilayer in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the comparison is excellent , justifying our hypothesis .",
    "an important aspect emerges from this study , which is that inspite of the widely used nomenclature of van der waal s heterostructures for few layer mose@xmath0 , one finds that there is significant covalent interaction between the layers .",
    "there have been alternate explanations offered in the literature .",
    "considering the crystal symmetry , su - huai wei and coworkers @xcite have suggested that it is the underlying symmetry that dictates whether the interlayer matrix elements will be finite or not for the band extrema at k - point .",
    "however , we point out that depends entirely on the character of the wavefunction contributing to the band extrema .",
    "a comparison of the _ ab - initio _ band structure for the monolayer and the bilayer ( fig.[fig:6 ] ) which have been aligned at the highest occupied band at k - point reveals the presence of other bands at k -point which are contributed by orbitals with mo - @xmath14,@xmath15 and se - @xmath16 , @xmath17 character which are perturbed in going from monolayer to bilayer .",
    "so , the @xmath6-filling determines the character of the highest occupied band at k - point",
    ". there could be other hexagonal compounds with entirely different bands contributing to the band extrema .",
    "while we have examined the onsite energies in going from monolayer to bilayer for the 2h stacking , there are other stackings possible . in order to examine whether our conclusions were general enough , we considered bilayers with aa , a@xmath8b , ab@xmath8 and ab stacking with the nomenclature used as given in ref.@xcite . in each case",
    "the _ ab - initio _ band structure was fit to a tight binding model with mo @xmath6 and se @xmath7 states in the basis .",
    "the extracted onsite energies are given in table [ mose3_all_stack ] .",
    "these onsite energies for different stacking of layers in mose@xmath0 bilayer look just like what we found in the case of 2h stacking ( table  [ onsite ] ) .",
    "this analysis clearly shows that renormalization of onsite energies does not occur for differently stacked bilayer structures of these materials .",
    "the evolution of the electronic structure with number of layers that we find here is not specific to mose@xmath0 alone .",
    "we find similar changes when we have examined the electronic structure as a function of the number of layers for mos@xmath0 also . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we have plotted the _ ab - initio _ band structure for the monolayer in panel ( a ) and for the bilayer in panel ( b ) . the tight - binding band structure has been superposed in each case and we have a good description of the _ ab - initio _ band structure .",
    "geometric confinement effects are expected to modify the onsite energies of the orbitals directed out of plane as against those which lie in plane .",
    "a comparison of the extracted onsite energies is given in table [ onsitemos2 ] . here",
    "again , we find that the energies for the monolayer and bilayer are similar .",
    "this shows that geometric confinement effects are not responsible for the changes in the electronic structure . when we considered the tight binding hamiltonian for the bilayer and switched off interlayer interactions , we recovered the monolayer band structure .",
    "the comparison between the model hamiltonian results with interlayer interactions switched off and the _ ab - initio _ band structure for the monolayer is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .    in order",
    "to demonstrate that the conclusions obtained from our analysis of mose@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 are general , we have considered a monolayer as well as bilayers of mote@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath9 band dispersions calculated for the monolayer of each of these systems along various symmetry directions is shown in fig.[fig:9 ] .",

    "the ensuing band structure for the bilayers , with interlayer interactions switched off , has been superposed on the monolayer band structure in fig.[fig:9 ] .",
    "the two are found to be almost identical for each of the systems shown here , indicating that the differences in the electronic structure between monolayer and bilayer arise due to interlayer interaction alone .",
