    "interactions concerning single spins are usually very weak , which imposes a huge challenge on the feasibility of their manipulation and measurement , and hence their potential for quantum information processing ( _ qip _ ) .",
    "inspired by earlier work  @xcite , it was suggested in 2009 that electron spin ensembles on the other hand could exhibit strong couplings with a collective field via magnetic dipoles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : storage ] )  @xcite , exploiting the extremely small mode volumes in stripline cavities .",
    "such strong couplings have also been recently demonstrated by independent experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was further proposed that the various spin waves in the ensemble could be used as independent quantum registers  @xcite , for which a proof - of - principle experiment was carried out demonstrating the storage and readout of multiple classical excitations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , so - called holographic qip schemes  @xcite should be possible by selectively coupling modes of the spin ensemble to the superconducting transmission line cavity  @xcite . however , promoting a memory system to a full qip device is non - trivial because the allowed operations in such a system are analogous to those in linear optics , and thus the provision of entangling gates requires non - linearity supplied by other components .",
    "one suggestion involves integrating a transmon cooper pair box ( _ cpb _ ) @xcite in the cavity ; moving a memory qubit to the cpb would facilitate universal qubit operations , as well as the readout procedures  @xcite .",

    "we propose a composite system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) where such devices are only used for measurement , but in such a fashion that in addition to simple readout , also entangling projections can be implemented .",
    "we envisage the use of a system that is both number resolving  @xcite and also non - destructive ; recent experimental demonstrations of such systems have been accomplished  @xcite .",
    "the realisation consists of two cavities coupled via a transmon cpb ; measurement of the number of single photons in the storage cavity is achieved via a read - out procedure involving the second cavity  @xcite . in effect",
    "this allows one to ask the question , _ are there exactly @xmath0 photons in the storage cavity _ ?",
    "if we wish to subsequently ask about a different @xmath0 , we would employ a flux bias to tune the transmon frequency ( a nanosecond timescale process ) . in the ideal case when no errors are present ,",
    "if the result is no then any coherent superposition of photon number states other than @xmath2 is preserved in the storage cavity  @xcite , which is coupled to the electron spin ensemble  @xcite .",
    "appropriate bias field and magnetic gradient pulses are applied for resonantly accessing particular modes of the ensemble as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous proposals , here the cpb no longer performs the role of gate operations on the mode qubits nor to store the qubits . after a brief review of the basic physics in the spin ensemble we shall show that , by using _ dual - rail _ encoding , a universal set of quantum gates can be implemented for the logical qubits .",
    "any single qubit rotation can be achieved by applying appropriate magnetic gradient pulses and adjusting the bias field when necessary .",
    "importantly , the two - qubit parity projection that we shall presently discuss can enable general quantum computing through , for example , the creation of graph states  @xcite .",
    "suppose the ensemble of @xmath3 electron spins is in its ground state @xmath4 and that the cavity contains a single microwave photon .",
    "if the bias field is such that the spins zeeman splitting is resonant with the microwave photon , then the ensemble will collectively absorb that photon on a timescale that is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the ensemble state after the photon absorption is then given by @xmath6 where the sum is over all possible spin - flip (  1 \" ) positions @xmath7 in the ensemble ( see  @xcite ) . here , @xmath8 is the cavity coupling strength with the @xmath9 electron spin in the ensemble , and @xmath10 is the average strength .",
    "the above state and state @xmath11 together form an effectively closed two - level system ( i.e. , a mode qubit )  @xcite .",
    "now if no parameters are changed then the quantum of energy will  flip - flop \" back and forth between the cavity and the collective state .",
    "however , if we wish to stop the flip - flopping , i.e. , decouple the cavity from this memory mode , then we will temporarily apply a linear gradient in the magnetic field such that each spin will acquire phase at a different rate .",
    "if the gradient pulse causes the field to vary in the @xmath12 direction , and writing the coordinate of the @xmath9 spin as @xmath13 , then the collective state becomes  @xcite @xmath14 here , parameter @xmath15 depends on the strength of the gradient and its duration @xmath16 , and consequently the various terms in eq .",

    "this prevents the @xmath17-enhanced mode - cavity coupling , and a single excitation is thus stored in the spin ensemble . indeed , if we were to introduce a new photon into the cavity at this stage then that photon will resonantly transfer to the ensemble almost independently of the presence of the former excitation  @xcite .",
    "after the application of the second gradient pulse , this procedure can be repeated yet again .    as long as the number of the excitations @xmath18 with an upper limit of @xmath19 ( since the coupling enhancement of @xmath20 is still very large for small @xmath0 ) , single excitations can be _ independently _ stored into and read out of the different collective modes @xmath21 by appropriately applying @xmath22-pulses with @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the superradiant state @xmath24 corresponds to the @xmath25 mode , and each time a @xmath26-pulse is applied it maps the @xmath25 mode to the @xmath27 mode . therefore , to access a particular mode @xmath21 a @xmath28-pulse is applied to map it to the @xmath25 mode , which then interacts with the cavity strongly upon resonance .",
    "a @xmath26-pulse is then applied to map the mode back . to stop the the mode - cavity coupling",

    "note that the time for the necessary gradient pulses can be shortened by increasing the gradient strength  @xcite .",
    "we encode the qubits in the dual - rail representation , where each logical qubit occupies two collective modes of the spin ensemble ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : singlequbitop ] ) .",
    "a logical qubit @xmath52 corresponds to the physical state of modes @xmath53 , where the ket notation denotes the number of excitations in the relevant mode for the physical qubits .",
    "adopting a dual - rail encoding of course doubles the resource cost .",
    "however , the capacity of the ensemble quantum memory is of the order of @xmath17 ; assuming @xmath54 , this is therefore not a practical constraint",
    ".    an experiment would begin with cooling the spins so that there are a negligible number of excitations in the ensemble , which is then approximately in the ground state @xmath55 .",
    "for each logical qubit we then load the cavity with a single photon , and perform a _ swap _ gate between the cavity and the appropriate memory mode to represent @xmath56 .",
    "a logical qubit @xmath57 of arbitrary state can then be prepared through an appropriate single qubit rotation on the bloch sphere .",
    "any single qubit rotation can be formed from a combination of rotations about two different axes  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlequbitop ] we show how rotations about the x - axis , and the z - axis can be performed in the dual - rail enconding .",
    "both these rotations involve _ swap _ operations between the memory modes and an initially empty cavity .",

    "we thus start with the initial state @xmath61 , where c denotes the cavity state .",
    "after the first full _ swap _ , the physical state becomes @xmath62 to implement a rotation around the x - axis on the bloch sphere , a partial _ swap _ is now performed between the cavity and mode 2 , resulting in the following state : @xmath63 or equivalently , @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "when the second full _ swap _ has completed , the empty cavity decouples from the qubit @xmath68 , ignoring a non - detectable global phase .",

    "we begin in the same fashion and obtain the state in eq .",
    "[ eq : swap ] .",
    "however , we now exploit the fact that applying a different magnetic bias field does not affect the phase evolution of the component @xmath70 ( which still acquires phase at the same rate @xmath29 ) , since the cavity photon energy is not affected by the magnetic field . on the other hand , a change @xmath71 in the bias field shifts the spin ensemble mode energy to @xmath72 , which results in a phase evolution of @xmath73 for the part @xmath74 during the time @xmath50 . ignoring the undetectable global phase @xmath75 , after the second full _ swap _ the empty cavity again decouples from the qubit @xmath76 .",
    "the relative phase accumulated @xmath77 manifests itself as a phase gate for the logical qubit , where the phase can be controlled by the time @xmath50 and the bias shift @xmath71 .",
    "having established how to perform single qubit operations , we now require an entangling operation in order to produce a universal set of qubit gates  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we show how certain types of measurement can facilitate such an entangling scheme ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle ] ) .",
    "in essence , we perform a measurement on the _ parity _ of two chosen logical qubits . if the parity is found to be odd ( @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) , then we proceed with the protocol .",
    "conversely , if the parity is found to be even ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) , then we reject the state .",
    "this is therefore a probabilistic entangling operation , however , it is well established that such operations suffice for efficient universal quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "our approach can be thought of as a filtering process ; we detect the state @xmath80 and reject it , and then similarly we detect and reject the state @xmath81 .",
    "any state that passes through this process without rejection must be in the odd parity subspace \\{@xmath82}. our protocol therefore consists of two basic blocks of operations , each ruling out the possibility of having two excitations in the relevant two modes while not destroying the quantum coherence between contributions to the state with different occupation numbers .",
    "as before , the cavity is emptied before the entangling gate operation , and it is tuned out of resonance with the ensemble modes during each measurement procedure .",
    "ns , @xmath83 ns and @xmath84 ns.,width=528 ]    let us now consider the first block of operations , concerning modes @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the cavity .",
    "for each correctly encoded logical qubit , the two dual - rail modes together only contain a single excitation .",
    "however , for the @xmath86 mode - cavity interaction there is still the possibility of exchange of two excitations , originally from different qubits .",
    "this two - excitation exchange is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath87 in eq .",
    "[ eq:2ex ] , which has three distinct eigenvalues @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 respectively . therefore ,",
    "if the @xmath86 mode - cavity state after the first full _ swap _ is @xmath94 , it evolves to @xmath95 for an interaction time @xmath96 ns . performing a measurement designed to detect whether there are 2 photons in the cavity  @xcite then removes the @xmath97 component if the measurement result is a no outcome . after a further exchange of @xmath83 ns , the part @xmath98 evolves to @xmath97 which can be ruled out by a second measurement if the outcome is no again .",
    "thus , up to now when successful , we are assured that there will be at most one excitation between the modes @xmath85 and @xmath86 , after it has been swapped back from the cavity .",
    "so far , we have only considered the two - excitation exchange , while there is also the exchange of one excitation . in order for the block to perform an identity operation , i.e.",
    "swap_s , on the one - excitation exchange subspace , a further interaction between the mode @xmath86 and cavity is required for a time of @xmath84 ns , followed by a full _ swap _ between the mode @xmath85 and cavity .",
    "due to symmetry , the second block of operations has the same effect on modes @xmath99 and @xmath100 , ensuring that there is also at most one excitation in between , if successful .",
    "hence , starting with two correctly encoded qubits @xmath101 or physically @xmath102 , successful implementation of the entangling gate leaves us with the mode state @xmath103 or @xmath104 in the logical basis , where @xmath105 is a normalisation constant .",
    "this is an odd - parity projection operation , which generates a maximally entangled _",
    "state when we start with @xmath106 as the initial state of the logical qubits .",
    "notably , such parity projections together with single qubit operations are adequate for universal qip  @xcite .",
    "with the above set of universal quantum gates , our integrated device is capable of performing probabilistic qip within the electron spin ensemble , in the ideal case when no errors are present .",
    "we shall now consider the various error sources , namely , collective excitation decay , imprecise timing in cavity - mode swap , cavity photon leakage , and measurement errors .    as mentioned before , the decay rates of the collective spin excitations and that of cavity photon leakage are orders of magnitude smaller than the collective coupling @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "moreover , errors resulted from imperfect pulse timings are all linear , and timing precision with a nanosecond resolution is feasible  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these errors shall be treated negligible as compared to measurement errors  @xcite , which shall be evaluated for the entangling gate in this section .",

[ fig : fidel1 ] that a high fidelity is possible as long as the error @xmath109 remains small , however , this does not automatically guarantee the presence of entanglement for the bipartite quinits .",
    "we therefore apply an entanglement measure to see how the degree of entanglement changes as @xmath109 increases .",
    "the simplest ( but questionable ) way of doing so is to apply _",

    "thus instead of the entanglement of formation , a more useful measure involving the whole five levels of the bipartite quinits is needed .",
    "we apply the generalised m - concurrence @xmath137 measure in @xmath138 dimensions as defined in  @xcite and derived in  @xcite , where m denotes the number of parties involved and equals 2 in this case . in @xmath138 dimensions",

    "this is marginally lower than the projectively implemented wootter s concurrence squared ( not shown here ) , for each finite @xmath145 .",
    "the difference is insignificant , partly due to the fact that the state @xmath118 in eq .",

    "interestingly , even when @xmath148 , the 2-concurrence is still greater than zero , although no information is learnt at any of the four measurements .",
    "this can be understood as follows : we have assumed that the phase between the measured state and the rest of the superposition is lost through the interaction between the system and the measurement apparatus ( see appendix )  @xcite .",
    "this corruption of phase information affects the subsequent evolution of the state and effectively causes a leakage of population from the components @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) in the computational subspace to @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "entanglement then appears to exist  and is registered by the 2-concurrence  both within and outside the computational subspace .",

    "therefore , we require a new metric for filtering out the latter kind to obtain a lower bound on the degree of useful entanglement",
    ". we shall achieve this by identifying a suitable theoretical operation that can be applied to the final state .",
    "it turns out to be insufficient to replace all population outside the computational basis with a completely mixed state in these levels , since the resulting curve ( _ solid blue _ in fig .",

    "since no information has been learnt in the measurement , this entanglement is of the ` spurious ' kind which we want to discount . )",
    "a better approach therefore proceeds as follows : we add any population that has leaked from the levels @xmath149 or @xmath150 back into computational subspace in a way that mixes the resulting state to the largest possible extent : @xmath155 the @xmath139 curve in 5 dimensions for this state then coincides with the square of wootter s concurrence @xmath142 for two 2-dimensional systems , hitting zero as @xmath154 ( _ solid red _ in fig .",

    "for this reason , we shall now briefly discuss an adaptation of our proposed circuit which can achieve a reduction of the cavity leakage effect .",
    "for each measurement procedure a control - not ( _ c@xmath167 _ ) gate is first implemented on the transmon , which takes about 50 ns .",
    "the _ c@xmath167 _ gate is controlled by the number of photons in the cavity , so in this case the _ c@xmath167 _",
    "gate is triggered whenever there are two photons in the cavity .",
    "the measurement cavity is then read out using a microwave probe , taking a time of about 400 ns  @xcite .",
    "as the probe measurement thus takes a much longer time than the @xmath168 gates and the _ swap _ operations , we can adapt our earlier circuit to reduce the number of read - out steps required in each block of the entangling operation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : entangle2 ] ) .",
    "this modified block achieves the same effect as our previous circuit , i.e. it removes all components of the wavefunction with double excitations in the relevant two modes while not disturbing the remaining components of the state . for a cavity with photon decay time of @xmath169s",
    "@xcite we expect a photon leakage of about 15.6% during a 0.5 @xmath170s operation , but this source of error can be further suppressed by increasing the _ q_-factor of the storage cavity in the integrated device .",
    "full quantum state tomography can be carried out on the logical qubits to determine the dual - rail mode states .",

    "therefore , we propose the following alternative as a simpler verification of the entangling protocol : the aim is to use appropriate measurement statistics on the final state to reconstruct a density matrix that is consistent with the one given by eq .",
