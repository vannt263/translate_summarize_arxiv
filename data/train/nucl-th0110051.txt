    "solar neutrinos from @xmath3b decay have been detected at the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite via the charged current ( cc ) reaction @xmath5 in the next phase of the sno experiment , currently underway , the rate of the neutral current deuteron disintegration ( nc ) @xmath6 will be also measured .    from the measurement of the cc reaction rate the flux at earth of the @xmath3b solar @xmath4 was determined to be @xcite ,",
    "@xmath7 the @xmath3b solar neutrinos were also detected in the precision measurement by the super - kamiokande collaboration ( sk ) @xcite using the elastic scattering ( es ) on electrons .",
    "that reaction is sensitive not only to the charged current weak interaction but also to the neutral current interaction . from the sk measurement",
    "the @xmath3b solar neutrino flux was deduced to be @xmath8 the difference between these two flux determinations , at the 3.3 @xmath9 level , can be regarded as a ` smoking gun ' proof of neutrino oscillations , independent of the solar model flux calculation . by itself , @xmath10 nc scattering can not account for the difference between ( [ fl : cc ] ) and ( [ fl : nc ] ) .",
    "the excess es events must involve a neutrino species which contributes disproportionately to the nc rate . according to the oscillation hypothesis , some of the @xmath3b solar @xmath4 oscillate into another active neutrino flavor @xmath11 .",
    "these @xmath11 neutrinos then can not cause the charged current reaction , eq.([eq : cc ] ) , but they can and do undergo nc scattering on electrons . assuming that this is what is really happening , one arrives at the total @xmath3b solar neutrino flux consistent with the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "this agreement may be used as a supporting evidence for the oscillation hypothesis , which will be further tested by comparing the cc and nc reaction rates measured by the sno experiment alone .",
    "the goal of the present work is the evaluation of the radiative ( order @xmath0 ) corrections to the cross sections of the cc and nc reactions .",
    "precise knowledge of these cross sections has obvious relevance for the determination of the @xmath3b neutrino flux .",
    "experimentally , one measures the number and energies of the electron events for the cc reaction , or the number of neutron events for the nc reaction , which after corrections for cuts and experimental efficiencies , is an integral over the incoming neutrino energies of the @xmath3b solar neutrino flux ( possibly modified by the neutrino oscillations ) times the differential cross section .",
    "hence any error in the cross section causes a corresponding error in the deduced flux .    in analyzing the sno cc data the theoretical cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the assumed uncertainty of the calculated cross section is reflected in the theoretical uncertainty of the deduced flux , eq.([fl : cc ] ) .",
    "however , radiative corrections were not applied to the cc cross section .",
    "the radiative corrections to the cc reaction ( [ eq : cc ] ) were evaluated by towner @xcite .",
    "that analysis was recently questioned by beacom and parke@xcite , who noted that the total cc cross section for detected and undetected bremsstrahlung differ , according to the analysis of ref . @xcite .",
    "such a difference is unphysical .",
    "the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite has lead to understandable confusion among experimentalists as to the appropriate radiative corrections to apply to the sno data .",
    "while the published sno result did not include any radiative corrections , the level of confidence in future cc / nc comparisons could depend significantly on a proper treatment of the radiative corrections .",
    "thus , in what follows we revisit the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , in an effort to resolve the present controversy .",
    "while we have no quarrel with the basic treatment of the radiative corrections to the cc reaction in @xcite , we confirm the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite and identify the origins of the inconsistency in towner s results : ( a ) neglect of a strong momentum - dependence in the gamow - teller @xmath12s@xmath13s@xmath14 matrix element , and ( b ) improper ordering of limits involving @xmath15 and the infrared regulator . after correcting for these issues , we obtain identical total cc cross sections for detected and undetected bremsstrahlung .",
    "the results imply an @xmath16-dependent correction to the total cc cross section which varies from @xmath17 to @xmath18 over the range of available neutrino energies .",
    "in addition to foregoing , we also recast the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite of hadronic effects in the radiative corrections into the language of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "although the traditional treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite and eft frameworks are equivalent , the latter provides a systematic approach for long - distance , hadronic effects presently uncalculable from first principles in qcd . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , matching the asymptotic and long - distance calculations ( in eft ) involves use of a hadronic scale , @xmath19 , whose choice introduces a small theoretical uncertainty into the radiative corrections .",
    "we argue that the choice of @xmath19 made in ref .",
    "@xcite is possibly inappropriate for the process at hand , and attempt to quantify the uncertainty associated with the choice of an appropriate value .",
    "given the sno experimental error , this theoretical uncertainty is unlikely to affect the interpretation of the cc results .",
    "it may , however , be relevant to future , more precise determinations of gamow - teller transitions in other contexts .",
    "finally , for completeness , we revisit the analysis of the nc radiative correction computed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case ,",
    "bremsstrahlung contributions are highly suppressed , the correction is governed by virtual gauge boson exchange , and the result is esssentially @xmath16-independent .",
    "we obtain a correction to the nc cross section that is a factor of four larger than given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which neglected the dominant graph .",
    "the implication of a complete analysis is the application of a @xmath20 correction to the tree - level nc cross section .",
    "our discussion of these points is organized in the remainder of the paper as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our formalism for the cc radiative corrections . given the thorough discussion of this formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict ourselves to only brief explanation of the basic formalism that is used to evaluate the corresponding feynman graphs and deduce the formulae for the differential cross section . in section iii",
    "we discuss the delicate issue of bremsstrahlung thresholds and the ` detector dependence ' of the cc radiative corrections .",
    "in particular , we derive the corrections for two extreme cases of very high and very low thresholds , and for an intermediate , more realistic case @xcite .",
    "we show in section iii where our results disagree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , and trace the origin of these discrepancies . detailed tabular evaluation of the modification of the differential cc cross section for the ` realistic ' bremsstrahlung threshold is provided as well . in section",
    "iv we consider the effects of the electron spectrum distortion .",
    "in particular , we consider the test of the oscillation null hypothesis , where the unperturbed @xmath4 spectrum of the @xmath3b decay is expected . in section",
    "v we derive the corrections to the nc reaction rate and discuss the differences with their treatment in @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "finally , in appendix we collect needed formulae for the evaluation of the triple differential cross section ( in @xmath21 and the angle between them ) for an arbitrary bremsstrahlung threshold .",
    "in the charged current neutrino disintegration of deuterons at rest in the laboratory frame , eq.([eq : cc ] ) , the incoming @xmath4 energy @xmath1 , corrected for the mass difference @xmath22 mev , is shared by the outgoing electron ( energy @xmath23 ) , the energy of the relative motion of the two protons @xmath24 , and by the energy of a bremsstrahlung photon @xmath25 ( if such a photon is emitted ) , i.e. , @xmath26 this energy conservation condition must be , naturally , always obeyed . for the neutrino energies we are considering the motion of the center of mass of the protons can be neglected .",
    "since radiative corrections are only few percent in magnitude , we follow towner @xcite and use for the ` tree level ' differential cross section the formula based on the effective range theory ( see @xcite ) @xmath27 where for @xmath28 we should substitute @xmath29 .",
    "it is important to remember that the radial integral , the overlap of the radial wave function of the two continuum protons and the bound state @xmath30 also depends on the momentum @xmath31 of the relative motion of the two protons .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : isquare ] the quantity @xmath32 evaluated as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , using the scattering length and effective range approximation as well as the coulomb repulsion of the two final protons .",
    "the most important feature of the @xmath28 dependence is its width when expressed in the relevant units of @xmath24 , the kinetic energy of the continuum protons .",
    "it is easy to understand the width of the curve as demonstrated in the figure .",
    "the dashed line represents the same @xmath32 evaluated neglecting coulomb repulsion as well as effective range . in that case",
    "a simple analytic expression obtains , @xmath33 is the deuteron binding energy and the proton - proton scattering length is @xmath34 = -7.82 fm .",
    "the value of the proportionality constant is irrelevant in the present context .",
    "thus the width is determined essentially by @xmath35 0.7 mev ( the term with @xmath36 contributes very little to the width ) in agreement with the more accurate evaluation .",
    "we explain the relevance of this width later , in section iii .    the radiative corrections consist of two components : the exchange of virtual photons and @xmath37-bosons and the emission of real bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "the feynman graphs for the exchange of virtual @xmath38 quanta and @xmath37 bosons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph1 ] .",
    "the bremsstrahlung graps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] .",
    "the photon emission by the moving electron is dominant ( graph ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] ) , but the complete set of graphs must be considered for gauge invariance .",
    "the treatment of radiative corrections proceeds along the well tested lines developed for the treatment of beta decay ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "let us consider the virtual exchange corrections first .",
    "while the treatment of corrections involving only leptons is straightforward , those involving hadronic participants require considerable care . to that end , it is useful to adopt the framework of an eft , valid below a scale @xmath39 gev .",
    "long - distance physics ( @xmath40 ) associated with non - perturbative strong interactions are subsumed into hadronic matrix elements of appropriate hadronic operators . short distance physics ( @xmath41 ) contributions",
    "are contained in coefficient functions @xmath42 multiplying the effective operators ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present case , the cc reaction of eq . ( [ eq : ccreaction ] ) is dominated by the pure gamow - teller transition @xmath12s@xmath13s@xmath14 .",
    "thus , for the low - energy eft , we require matrix elements of the effective , hadronic axial current .",

    "moreover , the @xmath45-dependence introduced through the short - distance qcd correction @xmath62 must be cancelled by a corresponding @xmath45-dependent term in @xmath63 .",
    "to date , no calculation has produced such a cancellation . while the effect of this uncorrected mismatch between short- and long - stance effects is likely to be small , we are unable to quantify it at the present time .",
