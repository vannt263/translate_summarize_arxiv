    "noise - induced non - equilibrium phenomena in nonlinear systems have recently attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of contexts @xcite . in general , these phenomena involve a response of the system that is not only produced or enhanced by the presence of the noise , but that is _",
    "optimized _ for certain values of the parameters of the noise .",
    "one example is the phenomenon of stochastic resonance @xcite , wherein the response of a nonlinear system to a signal is enhanced by the presence of noise and maximized for certain values of the noise parameters .",
    "another involves nonequilibrium ratchets , wherein intrinsically unbiased brownian motion in stochastic asymmetric potentials leads to a systematic drift motion whose magnitude and even direction can be tuned by the parameters of the noise @xcite .",
    "a third is the recent discovery of a re - entrant noise - induced phase transition in a nonlinear coupled array , that is , a transition that is only observed for certain finite ranges of noise parameters @xcite . a fourth such phenomenon",
    ", the one of interest to us in this paper , has been called `` resonant activation '' and was first identified by doering and gadoua @xcite and further studied by a number of other authors . here",
    "the mean escape time of a particle driven by ( usually white ) noise over a barrier of randomly fluctuating height exhibits a minimum as a function of the parameters of the barrier fluctuations .",
    "our interest in this problem first arose because it seemed to us that for sufficiently simple potentials it should be possible to find _ analytic _ dependences of the escape rate on the system parameters ( or at least good approximations to them ) and , more specifically , that it should be possible to find analytic expressions for the parameter combinations that lead to the minimum in the escape rate .",
    "some analytic results are available @xcite , including those in the original work of doering and gadoua that apply to a very specific circumstance discussed in more detail below . in general , however , most available results are numerical@xcite .",
    "analytic results are scarce , and usually apply only to one parameter regime _ or _ another and are thus unable to explicitly capture the occurrence of a minimum in the escape rate .",
    "a minimum in the escape rate usually arises from these approximations only by inference , and the approximations provide no way to specifically locate the minimum except as an intersection point of two unrelated approximations .",
    "they also do not provide a way to determine the dependence of the minimum on the system parameters .    in this paper",
    "we accomplish our goal , that is , we obtain a number of analytic results for moments of the first passage time over a fluctuating barrier for the particular model system ( a triangular potential barrier subject to dichotomous fluctuations ) used in a number of studies of resonant activation . in particular , we obtain analytic approximations that explicitly capture not only the minimum in the escape rate but that allow us to study the variability of the escape rate in parameter space , that is , the depth and width of this minimum .    in the process of obtaining these results",
    "we have also accomplished a number of important clarifications on the nature of models that have been presented under the common `` resonant activation '' rubric , and on the nature of resonant activation itself .",
    "some of these models in fact differ from one another in essential respects .",
    "we discuss these clarifications and differences in some detail , and thus shed some light on the role played by the interplay of the white noise and the barrier fluctuations on the escape process .",
    "we anticipate some of our findings :    * a distinction must be made between situations in which the fluctuating barrier can be  up \" or  down \" ( i.e. can go from being a barrier to being flat or even a well ) , and situations in which there is always a barrier . although resonant behavior can be observed in all cases , the physical picture underlying this behavior is different in different cases .",
    "* boundary conditions play an extremely important role in the problem .",
    "* the qualitative physical description of the resonance in the fluctuating barrier problem is as follows .",
    "when the barrier fluctuates extremely slowly within a range @xmath0 , the mean first passage time to the top of the barrier is extremely long because it is dominated by those realizations for which the barrier starts in the high position .",
    "the mean first passage time is then proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the intensity of the white noise . indeed ,",
    "if the barrier fluctuation rate is smaller than the inverse of the mean first passage time to the highest barrier , the barrier is essentially quasi - static throughout the process . at the other extreme ,",
    "if the barrier fluctuates very rapidly , the mean first passage time is determined by the average barrier @xmath3 , i.e. it is proportional to @xmath4 . between these extremes , and over a broad range of barrier fluctuation rates , passage over the barrier occurs primarily when the barrier is low , and the mean first passage time is then proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "this dependence is quite robust , and the prefactor determines the actual minimum within this broad range . * this behavior does not require that the barrier fluctuate ; an oscillatory variation of the barrier height yields essentially the same results .    in sec .",
    "[ statement ] we provide a detailed statement of the resonance activation problem .",
    "section  [ doergad ] discusses the analytic solution of the  up\"down \" case ; we show that the resonance flipping rate and the resonance activation in this case are independent of the white noise intensity . in sec .",
    "[ simpler ] the significance of the white noise and of the boundary conditions in this ",
    "up\"down \" problem are discussed in detail .",
    "section  [ bierastum ] deals with the case of barrier fluctuations when the barriers are always high .",
    "we obtain a single analytic expression for the mean first passage time that exhibits a minimum as a function of the barrier fluctuation rate and that in fact quantitatively captures the correct behavior over most of parameter space , as determined by comparison with numerical results . with this result",
    "we are able to determine the resonance frequency analytically , and also the range of barrier fluctuation rates over which the mean first passage time is essentially flat . in sec .",
    "[ square ] we discuss the case of a barrier that oscillates ( rather than fluctuates ) .",
    "this case also exhibits resonant activation , although some of the quantitative details of the problem are slightly modified .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary and some final points in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider a process that evolves in a bistable potential and is driven by weak gaussian white noise , so that the process is occasionally able to cross from one minimum of the bistable potential to the other . if the parameters of the system are fixed in time ,",
    "the rate at which the process crosses from one well to the other under a variety of conditions is well known ( e.g. the kramers rate ) .",
    "suppose now that the height of the barrier separating the two minima of the bistable potential fluctuates in time .",
    "we wish to explore the effect of the barrier fluctuations on the rate of passage of the process from one well to the other .",
    "more specifically , it is known that there is an optimal barrier fluctuation rate that minimizes the passage time from one well to the other for given parameter values @xcite , this minimum identifies the phenomenon of _ resonant activation_. we are interested in the analytic properties of the resonant activation phenomenon .",
    "note that the barrier fluctuations here are such that the energy difference between the potential minima remains constant  only the barrier _ height _ fluctuates .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the phenomenon of stochastic resonance , where the energy difference is modulated by a small periodic signal .",
    "we adhere to the overdamped regime , and hence the process @xmath6 evolves according to the langevin equation @xmath7 here @xmath8 is zero - centered gaussian white noise with correlation function @xmath9 one can think of the white noise as arising from a heat bath , in which case the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 is proportional to the bath temperature @xmath10 .",
    "time is measured in units of the friction coefficient , which has been set to unity in eq .",

    "@xmath21 is a non - equilibrium noise that coupled to @xmath22 causes the potential barrier to fluctuate .",
    "it is a nonequilibrium noise because there is no dissipative contribution in the equation of motion associated with this fluctuating term , and hence the system is open .",
    "the noise @xmath21 is usually taken to be exponentially correlated , the most ubiquitous choices being ornstein - uhlenbeck noise @xcite and markovian dichotomous noise @xcite . here",
    "we deal only with the latter : @xmath21 takes on the values @xmath23 , and the change from one to the other is distributed in time according to the exponential density function @xmath24 so that the flipping rate of the dichotomous noise is @xmath25 .",
    "the fluctuating barrier is accomplished by picking for @xmath26 the function @xmath27 and zero otherwise .",

    "( the distortions in the potential profile that may be caused by multiplicative noise , and the implications on the appropriate definition of an escape time , are well known and have been widely discussed in the literature ; see .",

    "indeed , the resonance therefore appears unaffected by and unrelated to the white noise ; in particular , the minimum in the mean - first - passage time in the doering  gadoua model appears not to arise from the coupling usually invoked between the white noise and the random dynamics of the potential .",
    "we have used somewhat equivocal language in this description because the situation is in fact somewhat subtle .",
    "the resonance in the doering - gadoua model arises from two features : 1 ) the random dynamics of the potential ( that is , the random switching between barrier up and barrier down ) and , in particular , the initial average over these dynamics , and 2 ) the nature of the reflecting boundary at @xmath51 .",

    "( [ basiceq ] ) , the system thus evolves according to the simpler langevin equation @xmath121 the solution of this mean first passage time problem is most easily found by splitting @xmath122 into two components @xcite : @xmath123 , the mean first passage time to @xmath20 when @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , the mean first passage time to @xmath20 when @xmath108 .",
    "the convenience of this representation lies in the ease of expression of the boundary conditions in terms of @xmath126 .",

    "as @xmath53 becomes small , the kinetic approximation @xcite is valid and the mean first passage time ( [ our ] ) reduces to @xmath162 where @xmath163 if @xmath53 becomes so small that the time scale of barrier fluctuations is much slower than the escape time , then this further simplifies to @xmath164 which is just the arithmetic mean associated with the two possible initial barrier configurations ( see discussion surrounding eq .",

    "( [ done ] ) , reads @xmath166 where the second line , valid if @xmath167 , serves to stress the point that the resonant mean first passage time is essentially the usual passage time over the lower of the two barriers .",
    "it is not particularly instructive to exhibit the full expression ( [ explicit ] ) for the resonance frequency in the original units , but if @xmath167 we can display the shorter expression @xmath168 it should be noted that both the resonant mean first passage and the resonant frequency depend on the intensity of the white noise , as does their product .",
    "this dependence appears in the exponents as well as prefactors .",
    "a general feature of our solution and , more generally , of the resonant activation phenomenon is that with increasing barrier height the resonance phenomenon becomes less and less sharp : a long flat region develops around the resonant frequency , a fact that has been explicitly noted in earlier work @xcite .",
    "analysis of eq.([t(x)aprox ] ) makes it possible to estimate analytic bounds of this flat region , which spans the range @xmath169 thus , rather than stressing the resonance aspect of the problem , it might be more accurate to describe the time scale of the activation process as relatively insensitive to the parameters of the system except in the limits of very low and very high barrier fluctuation rates . as noted above",
    ", if the barrier fluctuations are sufficiently slow , then an initially high barrier remains that way essentially forever and the system on average crosses it before the barrier flips .",
    "passage over the higher barrier then dominates the mean first passage time . at the other extreme ,",
    "when the barrier fluctuations are very rapid , crossing occurs essentially over the average barrier .",
    "however , over most parameter ranges the mean first passage time is essentially determined by passage over the lower barrier  the system can avoid passage over the higher barrier by  waiting \" for it to flip .",
    "provided the waiting time is shorter than the time it would take the system to cross the high barrier , flipping will occur first and the system will cross when the barrier is lower ( unless flipping is too rapid ) .",
    "this process is most efficient ( but not dramatically more efficient  hence the flat behavior ) at the resonance frequency .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the mean first passage time and the different approximations explained above have been plotted for @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "our approximation clearly captures the resonance behavior extremely accurately and for that matter the behavior of the mean first passage time over a broad range of barrier fluctuation rates .",
    "[ fig7 ] again shows the mean first passage time , but now with @xmath172 and @xmath171 .",
    "this figure serves to reconfirm the agreement of our results with the numerical ones , and also illustrates the flattening of the region around the resonance as the height of the barrier increases .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the resonance frequency as a function of the barrier height .",
    "again , our approximation clearly captures the exact results extremely well for sufficiently high barriers .",
    "it is interesting to explore whether the resonant activation phenomenon requires that the barrier fluctuate stochastically , or whether it also occurs when a noisy process crosses a barrier that changes periodically . indeed ,",
    "stochastic fluctuation of the barrier is not a requirement .    to investigate the activation process when the barrier oscillates periodically between a higher value and a lower value , we replace the dichotomous noise @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ basiceq ] ) with a square wave @xmath173 , a periodic function that alternately takes on the values @xmath129 and @xmath128 .",
    "the changes from one to the other occur at a constant frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the period of the square wave function is thus @xmath174 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation describing the evolution of the probability for the system now includes a time - periodic potential .",
    "the problem can be tackled analytically using floquet theory .",
    "we simply state qualitatively the results that one obtains with this exact approach , but then follow a simpler approach to arrive at some quantitative conclusions .",
    "we continue our discussion in terms of dimensionless variables and parameters .",
    "exact solution of the problem does , as noted above , also lead to resonant activation when the barrier changes from higher to lower periodically , with a resonance behavior very similar to that of the stochastic case .",
    "in other words , the mean first passage time is large when the period of oscillation is very slow and also when it is very fast . as before , and for the same physical reasons , in the former case the mean first passage time is dominated by the high barrier @xmath175 and in the latter case it is determined by the average barrier @xmath176 .",
    "again as before , between these two limits there is a flat region ( i.e. , rather insensitive to the parameter values ) where the mean first passage time is determined primarily by the lower barrier @xmath177 . the only difference between this problem and the stochastic one lies in the detailed way in which the mean first passage time changes from one behavior to the other .    to find the mean first passage time at the slow - barrier - modulation end of the problem ( where the difference between stochastic and periodic modulation is most pronounced )",
    ", we recall that for a fixed barrier of height @xmath178 the probability that the process has _ not _ yet crossed the barrier at time @xmath179 ( i.e. , the survival probability at time @xmath179 ) , is exponential @xcite , @xmath180 , where the crossing rate @xmath181 [ cf .",

    "if the barrier is not fixed , but instead changes slowly from one value to the other at predetermined periodic time intervals @xmath182 with @xmath183 , we can track the trajectory of the system explicitly and write down an expression for the survival probability @xmath184 that the process has not yet crossed the barrier at time @xmath179 .",

    "the assumption about the statistics of the crossing events yields @xmath190 the mean first passage time @xmath191 can then be calculated directly as a moment of this probability .",
    "the survival probability @xmath192 and associated mean first passage time @xmath193 when the barrier is initially @xmath177 is similarly obtained . to compare most directly with the stochastic results we assume that initially the barrier is equally likely to be @xmath175 or @xmath177 .",
    "a short calculation then leads to the following result for the mean first passage time when @xmath194 : @xmath195    this result corresponds to the same level of approximation as the kinetic result ( [ kinetic ] ) . at very low frequencies , @xmath79 , the mean escape time is correctly given by an average of the escape time @xmath196 when the barrier is @xmath175 and @xmath197 when the barrier is @xmath177",
    "this kinetic approximation also does not exhibit a minimum because it does not behave correctly when @xmath198 ; instead , it converges to the same value as the kinetic approximation ( [ kinetic ] ) , that is , to @xmath199 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the approximation ( [ squareeq ] ) to the mean escape time for the activation process driven by a periodic signal is compared with the escape time for the same system driven by dichotomous noise .",
    "the difference between the two is noticeable in the decrease of the mean first passage time with increasing flipping rate  the dependence on flipping rate is considerably sharper in the periodic case than in the random case .",
    "a similar effect has been observed recently in systems that exhibit coherent stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "the minimum first passage time and resonance flipping rate are essentially identical in the two cases .",
    "we have revisited the problem of resonant activation , that is , of the mean escape time of a particle driven by white noise of intensity @xmath2 over a barrier of randomly fluctuating height .",
    "the initial position of the particle is @xmath13 and the barrier is at @xmath20 .",
    "a substantial recent literature @xcite deals with this problem , but the results to be found in the literature are almost exclusively numerical . the distribution of barrier fluctuations is typically taken to be either dichotomous ( i.e. , the barrier fluctuates between two values ) or gaussian .",
    "the correlation function of the barrier fluctuations is usually assumed to be exponential and thus characterized by a rate parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the mean escape time @xmath18 of the particle over the barrier as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "it is observed that @xmath18 vs. @xmath25 exhibits a minimum , i.e. , there is an optimal barrier fluctuation rate that minimizes the escape time of the particle .",
    "this minimum defines the resonant activation phenomenon .    in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on dichotomous fluctuations and on triangular potential barriers , so our quantitative results are restricted to these cases . however , we believe that our results provide insights beyond these specific conditions . in particular , they provide insights for barriers whose fluctuations are bounded between an upper value @xmath200 and a lower value @xmath201 . the applicability of our conclusions to gaussian fluctuations is therefore less certain , but below we will present some conjectures for this case as well .",
    "a variety of approaches to the problem of the escape over a fluctuating barrier of bounded variation provide excellent and consistent analytic approximations to the escape rate in the limiting cases of very slow barrier fluctuations and of very fast barrier fluctuations . in the slow fluctuation case ,",
    "the so - called  kinetic approximation \" @xcite captures the behavior of the system very well . in the limit of very slow fluctuations ( @xmath202 )",
    "the barrier retains its initial height throughout the process .",
    "the mean first passage time for the ensemble is then just the mean first passage time averaged over the initial distribution of barrier heights .",
    "for example , in the dichotomous case if the height of the high barrier is @xmath200 then the mean escape time as @xmath202 is determined by the mean escape time over this high barrier ( the mean escape time over the lower barrier being negligible in comparison ) : @xmath203 this is the result captured , for instance , in eq .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) and in eq .",
    "( [ dd3 ] . clearly , this result is determined in part by the assumption ( generally made in the literature ) that an initial average over an ensemble of barrier heights is appropriate .",
    "the entire discussion that follows , including the occurrence of a resonance , is dependent on such an initial average or at least on the assumption that a finite fraction of realizations begin with a barrier configuration that is higher than the lowest barrier .    at the opposite extreme , when the barrier fluctuations are very rapid ( @xmath204 ) , the main effect of the flipping barrier is to increase the effective intensity of the white noise .",
    "the escape then occurs over the average barrier , with a diffusion coefficient @xmath106 which exceeds @xmath2 by an amount determined by the detailed distribution of barrier fluctuations .",
    "if the average barrier height is @xmath205 then the mean escape time in this limit is @xmath206 if the average barrier height is zero , then @xmath207 these are the results captured in eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ wn2 ] ) . in any case",
    ", the escape time is clearly smaller in the fast barrier fluctuation limit than in the slow barrier fluctuation limit .    in the literature ,",
    "each of the above approximations had been carried sufficiently far to deduce the behavior of the escape time as one moves away from the strict limits .",
    "thus , within the kinetic approximation it can be shown that the escape time decreases with increasing @xmath25 . at the opposite limit",
    ", it can be shown that the escape time decreases with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "these two results clearly point to a minimum for some finite value of @xmath25 , but neither approximation is sufficient to actually capture the minimum .",
    "our goal here has been to develop a single approximation to capture this minimum , and in this we succeeded .    however , we found in the process that a distinction needs to be made between two cases that lead to a different physical origin and parameter dependences for the resonant flipping rate and the associated escape time .",
    "these two cases have in the literature been treated more or less as one because both involve dichotomous fluctuations , but they are in fact very different .",
    "one of these is the case in which the  barrier \" fluctuates between an  up \" or positive ( barrier ) configuration of height @xmath208 and a  down \" or negative ( valley ) configuration of height @xmath209 .",
    "we have called this the doering  gadoua model @xcite . in the other case",
    ", the barrier fluctuates between a high value @xmath210 and a lower ( but still positive ) value @xmath30 .",
    "we have called this the bier  astumian model @xcite . for each model we found a single expression for the mean first passage time that has a minimum ,",
    "and we compared our results with exact ones obtained numerically .",
    "the agreement in both cases is excellent for almost the entire range of flipping rates , and in particular over a broad range surrounding the resonance .    the distinctive aspect of the doering  gadoua model is the fact that part of the time the  barrier \" is really a valley , so that the particle can essentially roll rather than climb towards @xmath34 during these times .",
    "we found an explicit expression for the resonant flipping rate and the resonant mean first passage time in this case : @xmath211 @xmath212 the noteworthy fact about these results is that neither the resonant flipping rate nor the resonant escape time depend explicitly on the intensity @xmath2 of the white noise .",
    "this fact seems not to have been noted before .",
    "we then went on to explore whether in fact this resonance is observed in a process defined by the doering  gadoua model with no white noise from the outset , and found that there is no resonance for such a model !",
    "we explained this apparent contradiction by noting a discontinuity in the @xmath119 limit of the problem and by presenting a modified set of boundary conditions that does lead to a resonance ( precisely the doering ",
    "gadoua resonance ) in the absence of white noise .",
    "in order to obtain a result for the escape time in the bier  astumian model that captures the resonant behavior we found that we had to retain terms in our solutions to one power higher in @xmath25 than had been done previously ( the lower orders yielded only the kinetic approximation ) @xcite . with this , we identified the resonant frequency and escape times as @xmath213 and ( more complete results are found in sec .",
    "[ bierastum ] ) @xmath214 we noted that that in this case both the resonance frequency and the mean first passage time at the resonance frequency depend on the intensity of the white noise , as does their product . at resonance",
    "the escape over the barrier occurs primarily when the barrier is at its lowest .",
    "we also noted that the dependence on the flipping rate , especially for high barriers , is very flat : there is a broad range of flipping rates where passage over the barrier occurs primarily when the barrier is low . in this broad range of flipping rates the escape time over the high barrier",
    "is so long that the barrier is likely to flip to its lower height before the escape is completed .",
    "we also discussed the fact that the resonant activation phenomenon does not require a fluctuating barrier  it also occurs if the barrier oscillates periodically between the high and low values .",
    "the behavior of the escape time at low and high oscillation periods is the same as in the dichotomous fluctuation case , and at intermediate oscillation periods a resonance effect is also observed .",
    "finally , we note that our analysis does not address the case of gaussian barrier fluctuations , that is , of ornstein  uhlenbeck barrier fluctuations @xcite",
    ". the results for such barrier fluctuations with fixed variance @xcite should be similar to our results for dichotomous noise .",
    "in particular , the escape time for the model analogous to that of doering and gadoua ( @xmath47 ) will show a minimum even in the absence of white noise .",
