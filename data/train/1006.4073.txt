    "the cylindrical contact homology of a ( closed ) contact manifold was introduced by eliashberg and hofer and is the simplest version of the symplectic field theory of eliashberg , givental and hofer  @xcite .",

    "a natural condition to impose on a compact , oriented contact @xmath3-manifold @xmath4 with boundary is to require that @xmath5 be _ convex _ , i.e. , there is a contact vector field @xmath6 transverse to @xmath5 . to a transverse contact vector field",

    "it turns out that there is a way to generalize cylindrical contact homology to sutured manifolds .",
    "this is possible by imposing a certain convexity condition on the contact form .",

    "we recall some definitions and describe some constructions from  @xcite .",
    "we first start with the notion of a liouville manifold .",
    "a _ liouville manifold _ ( often also called a liouville domain ) is a pair @xmath38 consisting of a compact , oriented @xmath18-dimensional manifold @xmath39 with boundary and a @xmath40-form @xmath41 on @xmath39 , where @xmath42 is a positive symplectic form on @xmath39 and the _ liouville vector field _ @xmath43 given by @xmath44 is positively transverse to @xmath45 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath40-form @xmath46 ( this notation means @xmath41 pulled back to @xmath45 ) is a positive contact form with kernel @xmath47 .",
    "we now recall the definition of a sutured contact manifold .",
    "a compact oriented @xmath48-dimensional manifold @xmath49 with boundary and corners is a _ sutured contact manifold _ if it comes with an oriented , not necessarily connected submanifold @xmath50 of dimension @xmath51 ( called the _ suture _ ) , together with a neighborhood @xmath52\\times[-1 , 1]\\times \\gamma$ ] of @xmath53 in @xmath49 , with coordinates @xmath54\\times [ -1,1]$ ] , such that the following holds :    * @xmath55\\times \\gamma)\\cup([-1,0]\\times \\{-1\\ } \\times \\gamma)\\cup ( [ -1,0]\\times \\{1\\}\\times \\gamma)$ ] ; * @xmath56 , where the orientation of @xmath5 agrees with that of @xmath57 and is opposite that of @xmath58 and the orientation of @xmath1 agrees with the boundary orientation of @xmath57 ; * the corners of @xmath49 are precisely @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , @xmath49 is equipped with a contact structure @xmath2 , which is given by the kernel of a positive contact 1-form @xmath31 such that :    * @xmath60 is a liouville manifold ; * @xmath61 inside @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath41 is independent of @xmath64 and does not have a @xmath65-term ; * @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a liouville vector field for @xmath68 .",
    "such a contact form @xmath31 is said to be _ adapted _ to @xmath69 .    here",
    "we briefly describe the way to glue sutured contact manifolds .",
