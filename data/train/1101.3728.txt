    "recently , tailoring static and dynamic magnetic properties of individual atoms and molecules by local environmental factors or local probes has drawn a lot of attention .",
    "this aligns with an effort to develop efficient devices for magnetic storage , spin transfer , molecular spintronics , or quantum computation , based on nanometer - sized magnetic atoms or molecules .",
    "one promising candidate for such devices is a group of single - molecule magnets ( smms ) consisting of several transition metal ions interacting through ligands .",

    "electronic and magnetic properties of smms on substrates were characterized using x - ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , @xmath6-detected nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) @xcite . on the theoretical front",
    ", the electronic structure and magnetic properties of a smm mn@xmath0 monolayer adsorbed on au were studied using density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . the theoretical calculations @xcite revealed that the mn@xmath0 molecules are weakly coupled to the au substrate , and that charge and spin transfer occurs from the au substrate to the mn@xmath0 , mainly , through linker molecules .    despite the great advances made in recent years , studies of smms adsorbed on substrates",
    "are currently limited to non - magnetic substrates .",
    "an understanding of magnetic coupling between smms and ferromagnetic ( fm ) substrates is , however , of a great importance for device applications and for investigation of properties of smms .",
    "for instance , the magnetic coupling can be used to control the reversals of the magnetic moments of smms or of the magnetization of fm substrates , depending on the coercive field strength of the smms relative to that of the fm substrates , similarly to exchange - bias systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , the magnetic coupling can influence electron transport properties through smms bridged between fm electrodes .    in this work ,",

    "we consider a structure where smms mn@xmath0 are adsorbed on a ni substrate via two s atoms .",
    "our dft and dft+u calculations show that the mn@xmath0 molecules prefer antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling to the ni substrate , and that their magnetic moments differ from the magnetic moments of isolated mn@xmath0 molecules .",
    "we find that the magnetic easy axis of the adsorbed mn@xmath0 is determined by the magnetic easy axis of the ni substrate which depends on a thickness of the substrate .",

    "as discussed , charge transfer occurs from the ni slab to the s - terminated mn@xmath0 molecule , or to the s ions which is the closest to the ni slab [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](a ) ] .",
    "the fact that the lumo and homo of the mn@xmath0 arise from the s @xmath7 orbitals , corroborates the charge transfer to the s ions .",
    "the band structure of ni entails favorable transfer of minority - spin electrons .",
    "thus , the total magnetic moment induced in the ni slab , @xmath47 , is positive ( sec.iv.c ) , and the difference in one - dimensional magnetic moment density between the whole structure and the bare ni slab ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] ) has a positive peak amplitude at the ni surface layer .",
    "this charge transfer lowers the magnetic moments of the s ions , resulting in the magnetic moments parallel to the magnetization of the ni slab [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](a ) ] .",
    "let us now focus on the region between the s and the mn ions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](b ) ] .",
    "the magnetic moments of the c and o ions closest to the s ions are much smaller than those of the s ions ( table  [ table:1 ] ) . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : geo](b ) , c and o anions are located between the s and the mn(1 ) and mn(6 ) . the bond angle created by the mn(6 ) [ or mn(1 ) ] and the o and c bonded to the mn [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](b ) ] equals 123 degrees .",
    "the bond angle of s - c - o in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](b ) falls on 114 - 118 degrees .",
    "while the s ions have dominant contributions from 2@xmath54 and 2@xmath55 orbitals , the c and o anions have equal contributions from 2@xmath54 , 2@xmath55 , and 2@xmath56 orbitals .",
    "the mn(1 ) ( mn@xmath21 ) possesses exactly half - filled spin - polarized @xmath57 orbitals .",
    "our calculations suggest that this inner mn ion is ferromagnetically coupled to the magnetic moments of the s , c , and o ions .",
    "the mn(6 ) ( mn@xmath20 ) has spin - polarized half - filled @xmath57-like orbitals and quarter - filled @xmath58-like orbitals .",
    "our calculations indicate that the outer mn ion is antiferromagnetically coupled to the magnetic moments of the s , c , and o ions .",
    "the same logic is applied to the other linker molecule .",
    "therefore , the magnetic moments of the s , c , and o ions are antiferromagnetically coupled with the net magnetic moment of the twelve mn ions . as a result ,",
    "the superexchange interactions render overall afm coupling between the local magnetic moments of the ni and the total magnetic moment of the mn ions via the s , c , and o @xmath7 orbitals [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](a ) ] .",
    "we emphasize that not only the separation between the ni and the mn ions but also the type and geometry of bonding to the ni and mn , play an important role for the superexchange interactions .    to gain further insight into the nature of the magnetic coupling , we investigate magnetic coupling in the following testbed systems : ( i ) a single mn atom adsorbed on a ni(111 ) slab via one s atom [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](b ) ] , and ( ii ) one mn atom directly bonded to a ni(111 ) slab [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](c ) ] . the magnetic coupling in system ( i ) seems to have similar mechanisms to that in the whole structure , in that the magnetic moment of the mn interacts with the ni slab through the s , and yet system ( i ) is much simpler than the whole structure .",
    "now if we remove the s atom from system ( i ) and bring the mn atom closer to the ni slab , the characteristics of the magnetic coupling are qualitatively modified .",
    "that is the case for system ( ii ) .",
    ", as a function of @xmath29 for the afm ( red filled circles ) and fm ( black empty squares ) configurations . calculated using vasp.,width=510,height=340 ]    let us first discuss the magnetic coupling in system ( i ) .",
    "we set the shortest distance between the s and ni surface atoms to be the same as that for the whole structure ( table  [ table:3 ] ) , and assign positive spin polarization to the ni slab in both afm and fm configurations .",
    "the s ion bonds to hollow sites of a ni slab of @xmath59 atoms , and the bond angle of mn - s - ni equals 145.5@xmath60 .",
    "our dft calculations using siesta suggest that similarly to the whole structure , the mn ion favors afm coupling to the ni slab via the s anion ( table  [ table:3 ] ) . as in the whole structure ,",
    "a major contribution to the magnetic coupling originates from a superexchange interaction via the s anion .",
    "an isolated mn - s dimer has the ground - state spin of @xmath61 , where the mn ion carries most of the spin polarization .",
    "since the s @xmath7 orbitals are completely filled and the minority - spin ni @xmath10 bands are not fully filled , minority - spin electrons can be transferred now from the s to the ni slab [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](b ) ] .",
    "consequently , the s @xmath7 orbitals possess slight spin polarization parallel to the magnetization of the ni slab , and negative magnetic moments are induced in the ni slab ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - b ] ) . the s @xmath7 orbitals are antiferromagnetically coupled to the mn @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "overall , this leads to afm coupling between the mn and the ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](b ) , table  [ table:3 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic coupling in system ( i ) is stronger than that in the whole structure due to the following reasons : ( 1 ) the vertical separation between the mn and the ni surface atoms in system ( i ) is shorter than that in the whole structure ( table  [ table:3 ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) a superexchange interaction through s is stronger than that via o or c , since s atoms more diffuse . in the whole structure ,",
    "the superexchange interactions are weakened by pathways through the s , c , and o orbitals .",
    "for the given geometry of system ( i ) , whether the 3@xmath10 orbital levels of the adatom are less than or more than half - filled , would not change the sign of the magnetic coupling because the magnetic coupling is mainly governed by a superexchange interaction .",
    "we now examine the magnetic coupling in system ( ii ) . in this system ,",
    "the mn atom directly bonds to hollow sites of a ni slab of @xmath59 atoms , and the mn @xmath10 orbital levels are exactly half - filled [ fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling](c ) ] .",
    "our dft calculations using siesta show that stable fm coupling is formed between the mn and the ni ( table  [ table:3 ] ) , in contrast to system ( i ) and the whole structure . in system ( ii ) , the bond length between the mn and the ni is short ( table  [ table:3 ] ) , and so the minority - spin mn @xmath10 orbitals hybridize with the minority - spin ni @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "this results in fm coupling between the mn and the ni , which agrees with other theoretical calculations @xcite . in system ( ii ) , if the 3@xmath10 orbital levels of the adatom are less than half - filled , then hybridization favors afm coupling between the adatom and the ni @xcite .",
    "we have investigated magnetic coupling between the smm mn@xmath0 and a fm ni(111 ) substrate , using dft and a dft+u method .",
    "our dft and dft+u calculations have shown that the mn@xmath0 interacts antiferromagnetically with the ni substrate via s , and that the magnetic moment of the mn@xmath0 is deviated from that of an isolated standard mn@xmath0 , due to interactions with the ni substrate .",
    "we have also found that the magnetic anisotropy of the whole structure is dictated by the anisotropy of the ni slab , and that the magnetic anisotropy barrier of the whole structure depends on the orientation of the mn@xmath0 relative to the ni slab .",
    "the magnetic coupling is mainly caused by superexchange interactions between the magnetic moments of the ni and mn via the s , c , and o anions .",
    "superexchange interactions take into account the bonding types and bonding geometries of linker molecules to the ni slab and the mn@xmath0 .",
