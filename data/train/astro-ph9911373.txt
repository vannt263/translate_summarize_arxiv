    "the temperature ( @xmath01 kev ) and plasma density ( @xmath1210@xmath13@xmath14 ) are comparable to those of the sun , hence the x - ray emission mechanism has been thought to be a scaled - up version of solar x - ray emission ; i.e. , magnetic activity on the stellar surface enhanced by a dynamo process ( feigelson & decampli 1981 ; montmerle et al .",

    "we extracted a lightcurve from a @xmath36 radius circle around the x - ray peak of ylw15 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "before the enormous flare from t tauri star roxs31 , which occurred in the last phase of this observation ( see  2 ) , we detected another large flare from class ii source sr24n , located about @xmath37 away from ylw15 in the gis field of view . to subtract the time variable contamination from the sr24n in the extended flux of ylw15 , we selected a @xmath36 radius background region ( see figure 1 ) , equidistant from sr24n and ylw15 . on the other hand , using such a background",
    ", we can not exclude the contamination from roxs21 ( source 5 in figure 1 ) , which is 2 arcmin apart from ylw15 .",
    "since the x - rays from roxs21 are dominant below 2 kev ( see  3.3 and fig.3 ) , we examine time variability only in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath17 2 kev ) in which the flux is dominated by ylw15 .    figure 2 ( upper panel ) shows the background - subtracted lightcurve in the 210 kev band with the sum of the sis ( sis 0 and 1 ) and gis ( gis 2 and 3 ) images .",
    "the lightcurve shows a sawtooth pattern with three flares .",
    "the peak fluxes of the flares become successively less luminous .",
    "each flare exhibits a fast - rise and an exponential decay with an @xmath38-folding time of 31@xmath39 ks ( @xmath40 = 61/46 ) , 33@xmath41 ks ( 80/47 ) , and 58@xmath42 ks ( 33/24 ) , for the first , the second , and the third flares , respectively .",
    "we show the best fit lightcurves for the second and the third flares with dashed lines , and show the best - fit quasi - static model ( see  4.1.1 ) for the first flare with a solid line in figure 2 upper panel .      to investigate the origin of the quasi - periodic flares , we made time - sliced spectra for the time intervals given in figure 2 .",
    "we extracted the source and background data for each phase from the same regions as those in the lightcurve analysis ( see  3.2 and figure 1 ) .",
    "we found that all the spectra show a local flux minimum at @xmath241.2 kev .",
    "for example , we show the spectra obtained with siss at phases 1 and 8 in figure 3 .",
    "this suggests that the spectra have two components , one hot and heavily absorbed , the other cool and less absorbed .",
    "then we examined possible contamination from the bright , soft x - ray source roxs21 ( source 5 in figure 1 ) .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of roxs21 from a @xmath43 radius circle around its x - ray peak .",
    "we extracted the data only during phase 1 , in order to be free from contamination from the flare on sr24n , which occurred during phases 46 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the background data for roxs21 were extracted from a @xmath43 radius circle equidistant from ylw15 and roxs21 during phase 1 .",
    "after the subtraction of the background , the spectrum of roxs21 is well reproduced by an optically thin thermal plasma model of about 0.6 kev temperature with absorption fixed at @xmath441.3@xmath510@xmath45 @xmath22 ( @xmath15 = 0.6 mag ; bouvier and appenzeller 1992 ) with @xmath40 = 17/23 .",
    "the flux of the soft component of ylw15 is about 30% of the flux of roxs21 , which is equal to the spill - over flux from roxs21 .",
    "thus the soft x - ray component found in ylw15 spectra is due to contamination from the nearby bright source roxs21 .",
    "having obtained the best - fit spectrum for roxs21 , we fitted the spectrum of ylw15 in each phase with a two - temperature thermal plasma model .",
    "the cool component is set to the contamination from roxs21 , and the hot component is from ylw15 .",
    "for ylw15 , free parameters are temperature ( @xmath46 ) , emission measure ( @xmath47 ) , absorption ( @xmath48 ) and metal abundance . for roxs21 , @xmath47 is the only free parameter and the other parameters are fixed to the best - fit values obtained in phase 1 .",
    "we found no significant variation in @xmath48 of ylw 15 from phase to phase , hence , we fixed the @xmath48 to the best - fit value at phase 1 .",

    "1997 ) . on the other hand , the class i sources el29 and wl6 , which emitted bright hard x - rays in the first observation , became very faint ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "then we conclude that hard x - rays from class i protostars in the @xmath16 oph cloud are highly variable in the time spans , and we suspect that the non - detection of hard x - rays from other class i objects is partly due to the long - term time variability . from ylw15 , we discovered a peculiar time behavior : quasi - periodic flares",
    ". we shall now discuss the relation between each flare from ylw15 and the physical conditions .",
    "if the three intermittent flares are attributed to a single persistent flare , with the three events due to geometrical modulation , such as occultation of the flaring region by stellar rotation or orbit in an inner disk , then only the emission measure should have shown three peaks .",
    "the temperature would have smoothly decreased during the three flares . however , in our case , we see the temperature following the same pattern as the luminosity , decreasing after each jump , as indicated in table 1 and figure 2 middle panel . to test further , we fitted the temperatures in phases 18 with a single exponential decay model , and confirmed that it is rejected with 89 % confidence .",
    "we then interpret the variability of ylw15 as due to a triple flare , in which each flare followed by a cooling phase .",
    "now , let us label phases 13 , 46 , and 78 as flare i , ii , and iii , respectively . in this subsection we will use the cooling phases to estimate the physical conditions of the plasma in each flare .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "here we assume that the plasma responsible for flare i is confined in one semi - circular magnetic loop with constant cross section along the tube flux , with length @xmath69 , and diameter - to - length ( aspect ) ratio @xmath70 , based on the general analogy of solar - type flares .",
    "to the decay of flare i , we apply a quasi - static cooling model ( van den oord & mewe 1989 ) , in which the hot plasma cools quasi - statically as a result of radiative ( 90 % ) and conductive ( 10 % ) losses ( see detailed comment in appendix  1 ) .",
    "if the cooling is truly quasi - static , @xmath71 shows constant during the decay ( where @xmath72 is plasma temperature and @xmath47 is the emission measure ) .",
    "we find for the three successive bins ( phases 13 ) of flare i that @xmath73 , which are not inconsistent with a constant value , taking into account the large error bars .",
    "then , fitting our data with the quasi - static model , we find satisfactory values of @xmath74 for the count rates , temperature , and emission measure ( see panel  1 in table  [ fit ] ) .",
    "we conclude that our hypothesis of quasi - static cooling is well verified ; an underlying quiescent coronal emission is not required to obtain a good fit .",
    "the best fits are shown by solid lines in figure 2 . from the peak values of @xmath72 and @xmath47 , and the quasi - static radiative time scale , we derived loop parameters as listed in table  [ physical_parameters ] .",
    "the detailed procedure is written in appendix .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath70 of 0.07 is within the range for solar active - region loops ( @xmath75 , golub et al .",
    "1980 ) , which supports the assumed solar analogy .",
    "the appearance of flare ii can be interpreted either by the reheating of the plasma cooled during flare i , or by the heating of a distinct plasma volume , independent from that of flare i. in the latter case , the lightcurve and @xmath47 would be the sum of flare i component and new flare component .",
    "the @xmath47 of the new flare component can be derived by subtracting the component extrapolated from flare i. the derived @xmath47 are 1.6@xmath350.4 ( phase 4 ) , 2.5@xmath350.8 ( phase 5 ) , and 1.9@xmath351.5 ( phase 6 ) .",
    "then we fitted the lightcurve and @xmath47 with the quasi - static model assuming the above two possibilities .",
    "however , in both of the cases , the model did not reproduce the lightcurve and @xmath47 simultaneously , and the quasi - static cooling model can not be adopted throughout the triple flare but flare i.    for simplicity , we fitted the parameters in flare ii with an exponential model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table  2 , and each models for the reheating and the distinct flare assumptions are shown by the dashed and the dotted lines in figure  2 , respectively .",
    "the obtained @xmath74 and the timescale for each lightcurve and @xmath47 were similar between the two assumptions .",
    "therefore both of the possibilities can not be discriminated . as for @xmath47 ,",
    "both of the fits show no decay or very long time decay , which is not seen in the usual solar flares .",
    "the constant feature in @xmath47 makes the quasi - static model unacceptable . since we can not derive the aspect ratio of flare ii by fitting with quasi - static cooling model , assuming the ratio derived in flare i and that radiative cooling is dominant , we deduced the plasma parameters as shown in table  3 . here , we derived the values assuming the reheating scenario ( the former assumption ) .",
    "the results show that the plasma density and the volume remain roughly constant from flare i. this supports that flare ii resulted from reheating of the plasma created by flare i.    as for flare iii , because of the poor statistics and short observed period , the fits to lightcurve with the exponential model give no constrain between the above two possibilities .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ fit ] and figure  2 .",
    "we derived the plasma parameters of flare iii in the same way for flare ii , as shown in table  3 .",
    "these values are similar to those in flare i and ii .",
    "all these are consistent with the scenario that a quasi - periodic reheating makes the triple flare .",
    "the heating interval is @xmath020 hour .",
    "the loop size is approximately constant through the three flares and is as large as @xmath014 @xmath76 .",
    "the periodicity and the large - scale magnetic structure support a scenario that an interaction between the star and the disk occurred by the differential rotation and reheated the same loop periodically ( e.g. , hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ) .",

    "in the course of a long exposure of the @xmath16 oph cloud with _ asca _ , we found evidence for a ` triple flare ' from the class  i protostar ylw15 .",
    "this triple flare is the first example of its kind ; it shows an approximate periodicity of @xmath118 hours .",
    "each event shows a clear decrease in the temperature , followed by reheating , with @xmath1 46 kev , and luminosity @xmath106 520 @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "apart from the periodicity , the characteristics of the flares are among the brightest x - ray detections of class  i protostars .",
    "a fitting with the quasi - static model ( vm ) , which is based on solar flares , reproduces the first flare well , and it suggests that the plasma cools mainly radiatively , having semi - circular shape with length @xmath119 ( radius of the circle @xmath120 ) and aspect ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum value of the confining field is @xmath121 g. the two subsequent flares have weaker intensity than the first one but consistent with the reheating of basically the same magnetic structure as the first flare .",
    "the plasma volume is huge ; a few orders of magnitude larger than the typical flares in rs cvns .",
    "the fact that the x - ray flaring is periodic suggests that the cause for the heating is periodic , hence is linked with rotation in the inner parts of the protostar .",
    "the large size of the magnetic structure and the periodicity support the scenario that the flaring episode has originated in a star - disk interaction ; differential rotation between the star and disk would amplify and release the magnetic energy in one rotation period or less , reheating the flare loop as observed in the second and third flares .",

    "we make use of the general treatment for solar - type flares , put forward by van den oord & mewe ( 1989 , hereafter vm ) . the decrease in the thermal energy of the cooling plasma",
