    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the rare decay @xmath0 proceeds through a @xmath11 transition , which is forbidden at tree level .",
    "such a flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process can occur at higher order via electroweak penguin and @xmath12 box diagrams .",
    "the @xmath11 transition therefore allows deeper insight into the effective hamiltonian that describes fcnc processes and is sensitive to the effects of non - sm physics that may enter these loops ; see , for example , refs  @xcite .",

    "both the belle and babar collaborations have observed exclusive @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays  @xcite and have measured the rate for inclusive @xmath0 decay  @xcite .    in this analysis , we study the inclusive @xmath0 process by semi - inclusively reconstructing the final state from a pair of electrons or muons and a hadronic system consisting of one @xmath7 or @xmath8 and up to four pions , where at most one pion can be neutral .",
    "this semi - inclusive reconstruction approach  @xcite allows approximately 53% of the full inclusive rate to be reconstructed . if the contribution of the modes containing a @xmath19 is taken to be equal to that containing a @xmath20 , the missing states that remain unaccounted for represent @xmath2130% of the total rate .",
    "we require the hadronic mass for the selected final states to be less than 2.0@xmath22 to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "we correct for the missing modes and the effect of the hadronic mass requirement to extract the inclusive @xmath0 decay rate for @xmath10 .",
    "this measurement updates and supersedes our previous result  @xcite , which was based on a sample of @xmath23  @xmath24 pairs .",
    "we use a data sample collected on the @xmath25 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb energy asymmetric @xmath6 collider ( 3.5 gev on 8 gev ) @xcite .",

    "a detailed description of the belle detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) and a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) are used for tracking and identification of charged particles .",

    "particle identification for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is important for this analysis .",
    "electron identification is based on the ratio of the cluster energy to the track momentum ( @xmath32 ) , the specific energy loss ( @xmath33 ) in the cdc , the position and shower shape of the cluster in the ecl and the response from the acc .",
    "muon identification is based on the hit positions and the depth of penetration into the ecl and klm .",

    "we require all charged tracks , except those used in the @xmath20 reconstruction , to have impact parameters with respect to the nominal interaction point of less than @xmath44 in the radial direction and @xmath45 along the beam direction .",
    "neutral pions are required to have a laboratory - frame energy greater than @xmath46 , photon daughter energies greater than @xmath47 , and a @xmath48 invariant mass satisfying @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "we reconstruct inclusive @xmath0 decays with a semi - inclusive reconstruction technique from a pair of electrons or muons and one of 18 different hadronic states . here the hadronic system consists of one @xmath7 or @xmath8 and up to four pions ( at most one pion can be neutral ) .",
    "compared to a fully inclusive approach , this method has the advantage of having strong kinematical discrimination against background by using the beam - energy constrained mass @xmath51 and the energy difference @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the beam energy and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is the reconstructed @xmath26 meson energy ( 3-momentum ) .",

    "the resulting veto sample provides a large control sample of decays with a signature identical to that of the signal .",

    "if one of the electrons from a @xmath78 or @xmath79 decay erroneously picks up a random photon in the bremsstrahlung - recovery process , the dilepton mass can increase sufficiently to evade the above requirements .",

    "this removes potential peaking background from the conversion of photons from radiative @xmath83 decays and from @xmath84 dalitz decays .    starting from a @xmath85 pair , @xmath86 candidates are formed by adding either a @xmath7 or a @xmath8 and up to four pions , but no more than one @xmath31 . in this manner ,",

    "we reject the @xmath103 background by a requirement on a fisher discriminant @xcite ( @xmath105 ) based on a modified set of fox - wolfram moments @xcite that characterize the event topology . in the semileptonic @xmath26 decay background , both @xmath26 mesons decay into leptons or two leptons",
    "are produced from the @xmath106 decay chain .",
    "this @xmath26 decay background is rejected by the requirement on another fisher discriminant variable ( @xmath107 ) constructed from the total visible energy @xmath108 and the missing mass @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are the reconstructed four - momenta , in the cm frame , of all tracks ( assumed to be pions ) and all photons in the event .",
    "we further reduce the background by requiring @xmath111 for the dielectron channel ( @xmath112 for the dimuon channel ) , and @xmath113 . here , @xmath114 is the @xmath115 of the @xmath26 vertex constructed from the charged daughter particles , excluding the @xmath20 daughters .",
    "we also reject candidates with an @xmath2 invariant mass greater than 2  @xmath22 .",

    ", there is an average of 1.6 @xmath26 candidates per event in the signal simulation . in order to select the most signal - like @xmath26 candidate",

    "the energy of the rest of the event , @xmath118 is calculated by summing the energies of all charged tracks and neutral calorimeter clusters not included in the @xmath26 candidate , and @xmath117 is the cosine of the @xmath26 flight direction with respect to the @xmath119 beam direction in the cm frame .",
    "the variables @xmath59 , @xmath120 , and @xmath107 are effective at rejecting @xmath24 background , especially for events with two semileptonic decays , which have large missing energy . for continuum suppression ,",
    "the event - shape variables @xmath105 and @xmath117 are useful .",
    "the variable @xmath114 is effective for rejecting the random combinatorial background in the high multiplicity modes .",
    "the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of these six variables are determined from mc events , separately for signal and background , with the exception of signal pdfs for @xmath59 and @xmath114 .",
    "we determine the latter two from the charmonium data sample , which satisfies all selection criteria except for the charmonium veto ( charmonium - veto sample ) , because we observe some discrepancy between the signal mc and the charmonium - veto data sample . to determine the pdf from data , we subtract the background using the shapes obtained from the @xmath58 sidebands .",
    "the number of background events in the @xmath58 signal region is normalized by fitting a gaussian ( signal ) and an argus function  @xcite ( background ) to the @xmath58 distribution . for @xmath59 , we use separate pdfs for the dielectron and dimuon channels .",
    "we then calculate the likelihoods @xmath121 and @xmath122 which are products of the pdfs of the above six discriminants for the signal and the background , respectively . in each event , only the @xmath26 candidate with the largest value of the likelihood ratio @xmath123 is retained .",
    "according to the mc simulation , this choice implies that 84% of the selected @xmath0 candidates in @xmath0 events have all daughter particles correctly assigned .    to check the distributions of the likelihood ratio @xmath124 , we compare data and mc , separately for signal ( fig .
