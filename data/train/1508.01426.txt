    "our daily life is strongly affected by the mechanical properties of wet granulates , be it through the stability of the soil on which we construct our buildings or the consistency of food we enjoy .",
    "the structure of the fluid interfaces in a wet granular bed essentially determines the strength of capillary cohesion and thus plays a key role for the prediction and mitigation of devastating events such as landslides or the clogging of industrial pipes @xcite . for a thorough understanding ,",
    "a realistic model of fluid movement is indispensable : the capillary pressure driven fluid transport in wet granulates @xcite changes the fluid distribution which in turn suggests that the mechanical properties are affected by the fluid displacement .    indeed , shear thinning for example is observed for partially saturated beds of glass beads @xcite due to a delayed reconfiguration of fluid interfaces .",
    "knowledge about the evolution of the fluid distribution in the granular assembly is relevant to many industrial processes that involve coating of powders and grains @xcite , or mixing additives with particulate materials @xcite .",
    "the precise microscopic features which crucially determine the nature of the equilibration and fluid transport processes are yet largely unexplored .    in this article",
    "we discover in simulations of the fluid equilibration process in a bed of spherical beads that contact line pinning can have a profound effect on the evolution of capillary bridge volumes . in agreement with the majority experiments on fluid transport and pressure equilibration in wet granular beds",
    "@xcite , we consider the wetting fluid to be the minority phase forming capillary bridges at grain contacts or in narrow gaps between neighboring grains .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that contact angle hysteresis broadens the distribution of final bridge volumes while the polydispersity of bead radii and the distribution of gap separations in the granular bed appear to play only a minor role .",
    "the present approach accounts for the discreteness of the bridge network and incorporates the history dependence of the bridge shape caused by contact angle hysteresis .",
    "combining the model for fluid transport with the contact dynamics ( cd ) algorithm @xcite allows us to simulate the motion of beads due to an external driving and the redistribution of liquid after the external energy input has been stopped . in this way , a direct comparison of our numerical results to the evolution of bridge volumes using x - ray microtomography imaging of fluid distribution measured by scheel et al .",
    "@xcite is possible . in these experiments",
    "vertical shaking of the granular bed was employed to distribute the wetting liquid on the surface of the beads . shortly after the agitation of the wet granular bed (",
    "e.g.  by stirring of shaking ) has been stopped , the surfaces of the beads are covered with a ` thick ' macroscopic film of the wetting fluid @xcite .",
    "frequent closing and opening of contacts leads to a uniform distribution on the beads since the timescale of collisions is typically much smaller than timescales of viscous flows on the surface of the beads or of diffusion through the continuous fluid phase .",
    "after the beads have settled into stable positions in the bead pack , the wetting fluid starts of flow to the points of closest proximity of opposing bead surfaces , forming macroscopic capillary bridges . at the end of this process , the liquid volume varies from bridge to bridge reflecting both the disorder in the bead pack and the distribution of fluid patches on the beads immediately after shaking .",
    "the initial regime of bridge formation is followed by an equilibration of capillary pressure which must involve an exchange of wetting fluid between neighboring bridges . in this ` equilibration regime ' the majority of the wetting fluid",
    "will be contained in macroscopic capillary bridges , cf .",
    "the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the present work",
    "we will focus on the collective evolution of bridge volumes in the equilibration regime where we assume that volume conservation holds for the wetting fluid .",
    "our model for the equilibration dynamics is based on the assumption that the fluid transport is entirely driven by differences in the local capillary pressure . for wetting liquids with a low vapor pressure this transport proceeds mainly through thin wetting films in the roughness of the beads @xcite .",
    "a diffusive transport through the vapor phase has to be considered for volatile liquids that exhibit a sufficiently high vapor pressure @xcite .",
    "central aim of the present work is to quantify the impact of contact angle hysteresis and polydispersity of the particles in the granular bed onto the equilibration of bridge volumes . in particular , we address the question for typical timescales of the transport processes .",
    "these timescales of capillary pressure equilibration play an important role in the rheology of partially saturated wet granular beds .     between beads with identical radii in mechanical contact . ]",
    "for simplicity , we consider the wetting liquid that forms the capillary bridges ( minority phase ) to be surrounded by a continuous vapor phase ( majority phase ) .",
    "analogous statements can be obtained for binary mixtures of partially miscible liquids where the minority phase is a wetting liquid while the majority phase is a non - wetting liquid .    throughout the following considerations",
    ", we will neglect contributions of the hydrostatic pressure to the pressure difference @xmath0 between the liquid ( l ) and vapor ( v ) .",
    "hence , the capillary pressure @xmath1 is the same in every point of the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "provided a uniform interfacial tension @xmath2 , the young - laplace equation @xmath3 implies that the interface is a surface of constant mean curvature @xmath4 .",
    "the mean curvature @xmath4 is the sum of the two principal curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a respective point of the interface .",
    "the influence of gravity or buoyancy on the capillary pressure @xmath1 will become apparent whenever the maximal difference in hydrostatic pressure is of the order or exceeds @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average bead radius .",
    "this is the case if the vertical extension of the system becomes comparable , or exceeds the length @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the difference in mass density between the wetting liquid @xmath11 and the ambient fluid phase @xmath12 , while @xmath13 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "two different models for the local transport of wetting liquid between neighboring capillary bridges can be considered . in case",
    "the wetting liquids forms a thin film on the surface of the grains , any pair of bridges on the same bead are hydraulic connected . assuming a quasi - steady flow in these films the total flux between two capillary bridges on the same grain is proportional to the difference in their capillary pressure . the corresponding liquid mobility , or conductance coefficient depends on the geometry and distance of the three phase contact lines of the bridges .",
    "besides the advective transport mechanism , we have to account for a capillary pressure equilibration by mass diffusion of the wetting liquid through the ambient continuous phase .",
    "the latter transport mechanism may be effective for wetting liquids with a high vapor pressure or liquids with a partial miscibility in the continuous liquid phase .      for systems",
    "where the non - volatile liquid forms a wetting film on the surface of the beads we will regard the average thickness @xmath14 of the film to be insensitive to the pressure difference @xmath1 between the wetting liquid and the vapor phase .",
    "this assumption is justified whenever the typical horizontal length scales of the roughness is much smaller than the radius of curvature of the menisci in the macroscopic capillary bridges .",
    "in addition , we need to assume a sufficiently small microscopic contact angle of the liquid - fluid interface on the rough grain surfaces that permits the formation of a percolating liquid film @xcite .    assuming a stationary viscous flow in the thin film at any instance in time",

    "an exact computation of the conductance coefficients requires solutions to the laplace equation of the local capillary pressure in the film . dirichlet boundary data for the capillary pressure are given on the contact lines .",
    "conformal mapping of the surface of the sphere to a plane allows us to reduce the problem to the computation of the capacitance per length of two parallel and infinite cylindrical conductors @xcite .",
    "this results shows that the dependence on the size and distance of the bridges is at most logarithmic .",
    "a rough estimate of the diffusive flux of a volatile wetting liquid through its ambient vapor phase can be derived from fick s first law @xcite . in full analogy to the second regime of capillary equilibration in the thin film model described above , we will assume that the concentration profile of liquid molecules in the vapor phase has already leveled in every single pore of the bead pack .",
    "gradients in the concentration are noticeable only on length scales much larger than the typical dimension of a pore .",

    "we employ the average bead radius @xmath8 as a unit of length .",
    "after rescaling the pressure by @xmath7 , the relation ( [ eq : volume_flux_film ] ) for the volume flux yields a capillary - viscous time scale of the form @xmath39 for the pressure equilibration by fluid transport through a thin viscous film . employing the relation ( [ eq : volume_flux_vapor ] ) instead of ( [ eq : volume_flux_film ] ) leads to a time scale @xmath40 for a diffusive transport through the vapor phase .",
    "volume fluxes of both transport modes can be superimposed as long as the linear relations between the respective volume flux and pressure difference eqns .",
    "( [ eq : volume_flux_film ] ) and ( [ eq : volume_flux_vapor ] ) are applicable .",
    "this implies that the timescale @xmath41 accounts both for flows through thin liquid films and for diffusion through the vapor phase .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless characteristic number @xmath42 allows us to discriminate between two different transport regimes : for @xmath43 , the diffusive transport through the vapor phase dominates while for @xmath44 the main transport is by viscous flows through the thin wetting film .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that both cases may indeed be encountered @xcite .",
    "the central message here is that although the relative importance of the two mechanisms may vary and can be expressed by the value of @xmath45 , the form of the transport equations remains unchanged .",
