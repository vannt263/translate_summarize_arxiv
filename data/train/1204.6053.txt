    "while the quantitative differences between @xmath88 and @xmath90 are functions of @xmath102 and other model parameters , this example provides a scale of the difference between the two effectiveness factors . in this work we have decided to model @xmath90 because it is directly related the small scale fluctuations in @xmath110 and @xmath108 , while @xmath88 is dependent on non - local variations in @xmath110 and @xmath108 ( see appendix ) . physical intuition for the decrease in the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor from unity",
    "can be obtained by observing the characteristic clustering patterns that are observed at different domain - averaged volume fractions , which are superimposed in figure  [ fig : eta_phi_dep ] . at low volume fractions",
    "there are a few small isolated clusters throughout the periodic domain , and as such , the cluster - scale effectiveness factor will begin to deviate from unity . as the volume fraction increases the frequency of these clusters increases thus making the effective contacting between gas and particle phases poor .",
    "near the minimum value in the @xmath90 curve , clusters begin to span the periodic domain , and the solid phase changes from the dispersed to the continuous phase . as volume fraction continues to increase",

    "a more fitting length scale is that associated with a cluster .",
    "however , the size of a cluster emerges as a result of fine - grid two - fluid model simulations , and can not be considered as an input parameter .",

    "the variation of @xmath101 is achieved by varying the value of @xmath8 . in order to maintain a constant @xmath100 the effective rate constant @xmath117",
    "must be changed .",
    "therefore , varying @xmath101 at constant @xmath100 requires the variation in the effective rate constant .",
    "it is this coupled variation that brings about the somewhat surprising the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath101 .",

    "we choose @xmath144 because this is consistent with earlier work in our group suggesting that _ filtered _ model corrections for gas - particle hydrodynamics become negligible at volume fractions of @xmath145 and higher  @xcite .    the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness model developed in this work predicts that effective reaction rates observed in coarse - grid simulations be larger than those predicted in fine grid simulations if the effects of fine scale structure are not accounted for via the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor .",

    ", the effective interphase mass transfer rates will be decreased due to the presence of clustering in the gas - particle flow , and any reduction in reactant conversion that arises can be attributed to decreased mass transfer efficiency .",
    "we expect that such an observed decrease in mass transfer coefficient will be on the order of the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor developed in this work . as an example , consider a mass transfer operation taking place between fcc particles and air , where the effective mass transfer coefficient is calculated to be @xmath153 using a model developed by  @xcite for fixed beds",

    "the need for the development of _ filtered _ two - fluid models for reacting gas - particle flows is demonstrated by considering a model first - order , isothermal solid - catalyzed gas - phase reaction .",
    "it is shown that constitutive relations for the _ filtered _ reaction rate and _ filtered _ species dispersion must be postulated to close the _ filtered _ species balance equation . due to the fact that the model gas - phase reaction in this work is isothermal and produces no volume change , only _ filtered _ species balance equations must be developed , without the need to alter the existing _ filtered _ gas and solid momentum balance equations given in the earlier works of  @xcite and  @xcite for non - reacting , monodisperse gas - particle flows . using fine - grid continuum model simulations of reacting gas - particle flows",

    "cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor is observed to retain an inverted bell shaped dependence on volume fraction approaching unity in both the low and high volume fraction limits . at intermediate volume fractions a decrease in the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor from unity is observed with the magnitude of this reduction being a strong function of _ meso - scale _ thiele modulus @xmath100 , and dimensionless filter size @xmath102 with only a weak dependence on schmidt number @xmath101 .",
    "due to the sensitivity of the _ cluster - scale _ effectiveness factor with grid size , we determine an asymptotic form for the cluster - scale effectiveness factor relying on a richardson extrapolation of the minimum in the cluster scale effectiveness factor .",
