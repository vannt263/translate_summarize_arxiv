    "our knowledge of the outer galaxy to date is largely dependent on hi emission surveys .",
    "the 21@xmath1 cm line observations outline a spiral structure out to at least 25  kpc , implying a minimum radius for the gas disk  @xcite . through the international galactic plane survey ( igps ) ,",
    "a widespread presence of cool hi  ( traced by hi absorption ) was found between galactocentric radii of 12 and 25  kpc  @xcite .",
    "it was not until 2011 , however , that a segment of a spiral arm at radii of @xmath715  kpc was identified by @xcite beyond the outer arm in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "this was accomplished by using the leiden / argentine / bonn  ( lab ) 21@xmath1 cm survey  @xcite , and new co observations with the 1.2  m telescope at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics  ( cfa ) .",
    "because of the far distances involved , high - sensitivity co observations are essential for delineating spiral structures in the extreme outer galaxy . @xcite were the first to detect molecular clouds in this region . due to the relatively low sensitivity of the five college radio astronomy observatory  ( fcrao ) co survey  @xcite",
    ", only a few bright molecular clouds were identified there  @xcite . until now",
    ", no coherent , large - scale structures beyond the outer arm have been identified in the second quadrant .",
    "we have carried out large - scale co mapping in the second quadrant of the galactic plane , which is part of the milky way imaging scroll painting ( mwisp ) project ] .",
    "one of the goals of this project is to probe the spiral structures further than the outer arm .",
    "this mapping has completely covered the regions between 120@xmath8 and -2.25@xmath9 , and between 144@xmath10 and -3.75@xmath9 . in the longitude range of 100@xmath5 to 120@xmath5 , the observations so far were guided by the latitude distribution of extreme outer molecular clouds previously reported by @xcite and @xcite , rather than an unbiased survey .",
    "the observations were conducted during 2011 and 2014 using the 13.7-m telescope of the purple mountain observatory  ( pmo ) in delingha , china .",
    "the receiver was the newly installed superconducting spectroscopic array receiver  ( ssar ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all observations were carried out in `` on - the - fly '' ( otf ) mode .",
    "the @xmath11co ,   @xmath12co   and c@xmath13o   lines were observed simultaneously .    at 115  ghz ,",
    "the main beam width was about 52@xmath14 , and the main beam efficiencies  ( @xmath15 ) were 0.46 for @xmath11co   and 0.43 for @xmath12co   and c@xmath13o .",
    "the typical rms noise level was @xmath7 0.5  k for @xmath11co  and 0.3  k for @xmath12co   and c@xmath13o , corresponding to a channel width of 0.16  kms@xmath16 .",
    "all of the spectral data were processed using the gildas package .",
    "it should be noted that any results presented in the figures and tables are on the brightness temperature scale  ( t@xmath17 ) , corrected for beam efficiencies using t@xmath18=t@xmath19/@xmath15 .",
    "details on the observations , data collection , and data processing steps will be presented in sun et al .",
    "( 2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "the 21-cm line data were retrieved from the canadian galactic plane survey  ( cgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , covering galactic longitudes from @xmath20 = 63@xmath5 to 175@xmath5 and latitudes from @xmath21 = -3.5@xmath5 to + 5.5@xmath5 , and a latitude extension to @xmath21 = + 17.5@xmath5 between @xmath20 = 100@xmath5 to 116.5@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity coverage of the data is in the range of -153 to 40  kms@xmath16   with a channel separation of 0.82  kms@xmath16 .",
    "the survey has a spatial resolution of 58@xmath14 which is comparable to our co observations .",
    "we created @xmath22 maps of the hi emission in the cgps  ( 66@xmath5@xmath23150@xmath5 ) and the co emission in the mwisp  ( 100@xmath5@xmath23150@xmath5 ) , by obtaining average emissions over a 5@xmath5 wide window in longitude .",
    "the data of the cgps in the range of 150@xmath24175@xmath5 were excluded from this analysis because of the degeneracy of the radial velocity .",
    "the outer arm has been widely accepted as the outermost arm in the second quadrant  @xcite .",
    "however , all @xmath22 maps reveal a clear and distinct feature distributed beyond the outer arm at a maximum negative velocity .",
    "this outermost feature varies in latitude and velocity . in figure 1",
    ", we show one of these @xmath22 distributions from both the co  ( image ) and the hi  ( contours ) emissions in longitude from 127@xmath5 to 132@xmath5 .",
    "the outer arm and the outermost feature are clearly seen as strong , separate features .    to highlight the outermost feature ,",
    "a @xmath25 map of integrated hi emission over a window that follows the feature in latitude is shown in figure  2a .",
    "the high - mass star forming regions  ( hmsfrs ) assigned to the outer and perseus arms are marked with squares and diamonds , respectively  @xcite .",
    "similarly , figure  2b focuses on the outermost feature , obtained by integrating the hi emission over a window that follows the feature in velocity .",
    "it is worth noting that at large negative velocities , the hi emission forms an arc from @xmath2675@xmath5 , @xmath273@xmath5 , @xmath28 - 110  kms@xmath16 , through @xmath26110@xmath5 , @xmath273.5@xmath5 , @xmath28 - 105  kms@xmath16 , to @xmath26150@xmath5 , @xmath27 - 2@xmath5 , @xmath28 - 70  kms@xmath16 , running roughly parallel to the locus of the outer arm but shifted by 20 - 30  kms@xmath16   to more negative velocities .",
    "this suggests that it may be a segment of a major spiral arm since spiral arms have long been recognized as presenting coherent arcs and loops in galactic @xmath25 plots of atomic and molecular emissions  @xcite .",
    "the present feature was largely overlooked in the past since only short segments of it appear in l - v diagrams at any specific latitude or even in an l - v diagram integrated over all latitudes covered by the cgps  ( e.g. , in figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "before giving an explicit claim of a new spiral arm , we investigated the characteristics of the outermost feature in more detail . so far a total of 72 molecular clouds that are probably attributed to the outermost feature were detected by mwisp .",
    "these 72 clouds are marked with circles in figures 2 and 3 and also summarized in table  1 .",
    "more than 10 clouds show clear @xmath12co   detections while many of other clouds were only marginally detected .",
    "however , none of them show c@xmath13o   detections .",
    "the isotope abundance ratios in the extreme outer galaxy will be studied in the forthcoming deep observations .",
    "actually , all known clouds in the extreme outer galaxy reported by @xcite and @xcite were detected by the present survey .",
    "we labelled all these known clouds in column ( 1 ) of table 1 .",
    "note that the clouds reported by @xcite in the higher longitude range of 145@xmath24151@xmath5 are not included in table 1 , since these clouds are partially blended in velocity with emission at less negative velocities .",
    "besides , they might lie in the outer arm or in the inter - arm on the assumption of the rotation curve of @xcite .",
    "most of the clouds are newly discovered , which suggests that we may still miss some molecular clouds in the interval 100@xmath24120@xmath5 due to the narrow latitude coverage .",
    "the derived masses , mainly on the order of 10@xmath29m@xmath4 to 10@xmath30m@xmath4 , fall in the typical range for the masses of molecular clouds that are usually confined to spiral arms .",
    "note that the mass is a lower limit , since the adopted co - to - h@xmath31 x factor 1.8@xmath3210@xmath33 @xmath34 is measured in the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , a recent study suggested that the x factor rises by a factor of 2@xmath13 between the solar circle and the circle at @xmath35=14  kpc  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the beam dilution effects lower the signal - to - noise ratio and hence also reduce the derived masses .",
    "we have selected one example with the largest negative velocities we recently detected  ( molecular cloud 24 marked with cross ) and presented the velocity - integrated intensity and spectrum of the peak emission in figure 2b . although these molecular clouds are more sparsely distributed than the atomic gas , both explicitly trace the same coherent , large - scale structure , i.e. , the new arm well .",
    "the warp of the galactic disk is obvious  ( figure 2b ) , which exhibits a clear positive warp between @xmath20 = 66@xmath5 and 135@xmath5 , and a negative warp between @xmath20 = 135@xmath5 to 150@xmath5 . assuming a mean distance of 12  kpc , the new arm with thickness in @xmath0 of about 2@xmath5 to 3@xmath5 correspond to about 400 to 600  pc .",
    "generally , the new arm is more severely warped and thicker than the outer arm .",
    "this is in good agreement with the theory for both external spiral galaxies and our galaxy , which suggests that the warping and thicknesses of the disks increase with increasing distance from the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the new arm is distinct from the outer arm with a spatial separation of about 3@xmath14  kpc , which is consistent with the typical span of the spiral arms outside the perseus arm  @xcite .",
    "locations of all available molecular clouds in the far outer galaxy are compared with the spiral arm model in figure  3 , superposed on : ( a ) co @xmath25 diagram from @xcite , and ( b ) an artist s conception of the milky way  ( r. hurt : nasa / jpl - caltech / ssc ) .",
    "the artist s image has been scaled to place the hmsfrs in the spiral arms .",
    "these clouds are indicated by filled stars , triangles and circles , which cover galactic longitudes from @xmath20=13@xmath5 to 55@xmath5 detected by @xcite , and from @xmath20=100@xmath5 to 150@xmath5 detected by us .",
    "the squares indicate the locations of the hmsfrs associated with the outer arm  @xcite .",
    "the white dashed line in figure 3 is a log spiral that was fit to the scutum - centaurus arm in the inner galaxy  @xcite .",
    "generally , our data are in agreement with the far - extension of the scutum - centaurus arm in the second quadrant",
    ". however , confirmation of this hypothesis would be a challenge as suggested by @xcite .    we attempted to fit the distribution of these outermost clouds , adopting a log@xmath1periodic spiral model defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the galactocentric radius at a galactocentric azimuth @xmath38 for an arm with a radius @xmath39 at reference azimuth @xmath40 and pitch angle @xmath41 .",
    "the bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) procedure was adopted to estimate the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath41 ( see paper of @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the best@xmath1fitting spiral model for the co data on the interval 120@xmath42150@xmath5 is @xmath39 = 17.8@xmath61.0  kpc at @xmath40 = 27.0@xmath5 and @xmath41= 10.8@xmath5 @xmath6 7.6@xmath5  ( indicated by the red dashed line in figure 3 ) . the best@xmath1fitting spiral model for all of the available co data including clouds detected by @xcite is @xmath39 = 16.1@xmath61.0  kpc at @xmath40 = 43.9@xmath5 and @xmath41= 9.3@xmath5 @xmath6 0.7@xmath5  ( indicated by the cyan solid line in figure 3 ) .",
    "the uncertainties give a 68% confidence range .",
    "the consistent fitting results confirm that the new arm can be interpreted as the far - extension of the distant arm recently discovered by @xcite .",
    "apparently , both models fit the data well over a wide longitude range , except in @xmath20=100@xmath5 to 116@xmath5 , where the model deviates from the data",
    ". such departures might be caused by the kinematic distance uncertainty .",
    "indeed , any systematic velocity departures can lead to distance uncertainty .",
    "the velocity departures , including both positive and negative values have already been observed , e.g. , in the perseus arm between 90@xmath5 and 150@xmath5 and the sagittarius - carina arm  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the bias introduced by the incompleteness of the sample due to the narrow latitude coverage in this longitude interval , as mentioned above .",
    "the parallax measurements and mwisp projects in progress will be required to solve the problem and determine the new arm more accurately .",
    "we are grateful to all of the staff of the 14-m telescope of the pmo for their dedicated assistance .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "mark reid for using of his fitting procedure .",
