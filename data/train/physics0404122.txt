    "the hexagonal nanonetwork materials composed of atoms with ionic characters , for example , boron - nitride ( bn ) sheets and nanotubes [ 1 ] , have been investigated intensively .",
    "they are intrinsically insulators with the energy gap @xmath0 of about 4 ev as the preceding band calculations have indicated [ 2,3 ] .",
    "the possible photogalvanic effects depending on the chiralities of bn nanotubes have been proposed by the model calculation [ 4 ] .",
    "1 . optical excitations along the bn alternations .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate optical excitation properties in bn systems .",
    "there is a permanent electric dipole moment along the bn bond , which will give rise to strong excitonic properties as illustrated in fig .",
    "low energy optical excitations are the excitations of the electron - hole pairs between the higher occupied states of n and the lower unoccupied states of b atoms .",
    "we consider exciton interactions among nearest neighbor dipoles . in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , the b and n atoms are represented by full and open circles , respectively .",
    "we assume one orbital hubbard model with the hopping integral of electrons @xmath1 , the onsite repulsion @xmath2 , and the energy difference @xmath0 between the b and n sites .",
    "after second order perturbations , we obtain the following forms of the nearest neighbor interactions : @xmath3 for the case of conserved excited spin ( type-1 interaction ) and @xmath4 for the case that spin of the excited electron flips ( type-2 interaction ) .",
    "the condition @xmath5 means that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive .",
    "the interactions are present along the thin lines of fig .",
    "2 ( a ) . after the extraction of the interactions @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", there remains the two - dimensional kagom lattice which is shown in fig .",

    "+ & + & _ i , j j_2 ( |i , j,| + |i , j,| + h.c . ) , where the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 mean the vertex points of the kagom lattice , and the sum is taken over the nearest neighbor pairs @xmath10 and the excited spin @xmath11 .",
    "the unit cell has three lattice points , namely , 1 , 2 , and 3 , as shown in fig .",

    "the energy dispersions of the model are given in terms of wavenumbers @xmath12 : e = \\ {    l - 2 ( j_1 + j_2 ) , + ( j_1 + j_2 ) [ 1 + ] , + 2 ( - j_1 + j_2 ) , + ( j_1 - j_2 ) [ 1 + ] ,    . where the two dimensional x - y axes are defined as usual in fig . 2 , and @xmath13 is the unit cell length of the kagom lattice in fig",

    "2 ( a ) . there appears a dispersionless band ( triplet state ) with the lowest energy @xmath15 .",
    "there is another dispersionless band ( singlet state ) at the higher energy @xmath16 .",
    "such the appearance of the flat band has been discussed with the possibility of ferromagnetism in the literatures [ 5 ] . in the present case ,",
    "the lowest optical excitation band becomes flat in the honeycomb bn plane .",
    "when the bn plane is rolled up into nanotubes , the flat band is dispersionless too .",
    "the flat exciton band will have strong optical density originating from the huge density of states due to the weak dispersive character .",
    "symmetries of two wavefunctions at @xmath17 .",
    "the full and open circles indicate positive and negative values at the lattice point , respectively .",

    "the symmetries of the twofold degenerate solutions are shown in fig .",
    "both wavefunctions have the symmetry _ gerade_.",
    "the transition to the lowest exciton is optically forbidden , which indicates that excitons relaxed to this lowest exciton band will show quite long lifetime which will cause luminescence properties .",
    "in addition , the lowest energy excitons will have huge density of state due to the flatness of the band .",
    "these properties might result in interesting optical measurements in hexagonal nanonetwork materials .",
