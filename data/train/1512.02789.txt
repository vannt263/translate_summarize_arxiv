    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of an accreting compact star , either a black hole or a neutron star ( ns ) and a low - mass ( @xmath6 ) donor star , in which mass transfer proceeds via roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "there are about 200 lmxbs in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the formation of black hole lmxbs is still a controversial topic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , and will be discussed elsewhere . here",
    "we focus on the formation and evolution of lmxbs with a ns .",
    "the mainstream idea is that they either have an initially low - mass secondary , or descend from systems with initially intermediate - mass secondaries , i.e. , intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ; * ? ? ?",

    "only a small part of the binaries can survive as i / lmxbs @xcite . for reviews on the formation and evolution of i",
    "/ lmxbs , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the stability of the mass transfer in i / lmxbs depends on the mass ratio , the orbital period , and the mass and angular momentum loss ( aml ; * ? ? ?",
    "dynamically unstable mass transfer leads to a ( second ) ce evolution , with the ns spiraling into the envelope of the donor star . if the binary survives without merging , it becomes a compact binary with a helium ( he ) star around the ns",
    "the subsequent mass transfer from the he star may lead to the formation of a partially recycled pulsar with a co white dwarf ( wd ) companion @xcite . for those binaries avoiding the ce phase , @xcite pointed out that there exists a bifurcation period ( @xmath8 ) for the initial orbital period , which separates i / lmxbs into converging or diverging systems .",
    "the existence of this bifurcation period is due to the balance between the orbital expansion caused by nuclear evolution of the donor star and the orbital shrinking caused by aml .",
    "binaries with @xmath9 continue to contract along the cataclysmic variable ( cv)-like or ultra - compact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) evolutionary tracks , while those with @xmath10 will become relatively wide binaries containing a recycled ns and a he or co wd @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a systematic investigation of the evolution of i / lmxbs by using a henyey - type stellar evolution code to calculate 100 binary evolution sequences . in that work ,",
    "the initial mass of the ns was fixed as @xmath11 , the initial mass of the donor ranged from @xmath12 , and the initial orbital period went from 4 hr to 100 days .",
    "while the calculated results showed a variety of evolutionary channels which may explain the large diversity in observed lmxbs , they also indicated a number of remaining problems , in particular the low median x - ray luminosities as compared to those of observed lmxbs .",
    "@xcite firstly combined the binary population synthesis ( bps ) method with detailed stellar evolutionary sequences of @xcite to follow the evolution of a population of i / lmxbs .",
    "for early cases b and c mass transfer they adopted a fixed value of the critical ratio of the donor mass and the ns mass ( @xmath13 ) to determine whether the mass transfer is stable .",
    "late cases b and c mass transfer was always assumed to be dynamically unstable followed by a ce phase . when dealing with ce evolution , they adopted constant values of the binding energy parameter @xmath14 , 0.3 and 0.5 , which parameterizes the structure of the donor s envelope .",
    "their calculations demonstrated that incipient imxbs outnumber incipient lmxbs typically by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "it was also found that rather large values of @xmath16 are required to yield the i / lmxb birthrates that are consistent with the bmsp birthrates , but such values of @xmath17 would lead to an overproduction of luminous lmxbs in the galaxy .",
    "there were still large discrepancies between the orbital period distributions of modeled and observed binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) .",
    "a possible solution to the above problems was to reduce the mean x - ray lifetime of lmxbs by a factor of @xmath18 .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the formation and evolution of galactic i / lmxbs .",
    "similar as @xcite , we perform a systematic evolutionary study of i / lmxbs , combining bps with detailed binary evolutionary sequences . to follow the formation and evolution of i / lmxbs , we take into account updated theoretical results and techniques on binary evolution achieved during the last ten years .",
    "we use the rapid binary evolution algorithm developed by @xcite for bps calculation , which enables modeling of a large number of complex binary systems to obtain the incipient population of i / lmxbs , and an updated version of the @xcite code to calculate the detailed evolution of individual i / lmxbs . with them",
    "we can follow the evolutionary tracks of the i / lmxb population from the incipient stage of a detached binary containing a newborn ns to the rlof phase , and finally to the remnant state with a bmsp .",
    "the parameter distributions of i / lmxbs and bmsps can be clearly displayed , and compared with observations .",
    "the most important and difficult to understand processes during binary evolution are unstable mass transfer and ce evolution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) . in the bps calculations , instead of using the empirical relations for the critical mass ratios",
    ", we employ the numerically calculated results of @xcite to judge the stability of mass transfer in a primordial binary , and the parameter space obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) to determine whether i / lmxbs can successfully evolve to be binary pulsars .",
    "we also adopt the calculated values of @xmath19 given by @xcite to calculate the orbital change during the ce phase , which depend on the evolutionary state of the donor .",
    "other improvement will be mentioned below .",
    "although these updated parameters are still subject to large uncertainties , they provide physically more reasonable and realistic input as compared to previous bps studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the methods used in this paper .",
    "we present the detailed results derived from our calculations and discuss their implications in section 3 .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we use the bps code developed by @xcite and modified by @xcite to generate the incipient i / lmxb population .",
    "this code , based on single star evolution with a series of analytic formulae @xcite , includes standard assumptions for the population of massive primordial binaries and analytic prescriptions to describe binary interactions , mass transfer and sn explosions .",
    "we have updated the code in various aspects , in particular the formation and evolutionary processes of compact objects .",
    "some key points are described below ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the stability of mass transfer is determined by the change of the donor s radius with respect to its rl radius .",
    "usually a critical mass ratio @xmath20 (= donor mass / accretor mass ) is used as a criterion : if the mass ratio is larger than @xmath20 at the onset of rlof , the mass transfer is unstable and results in a ce evolution ; otherwise the mass transfer proceeds stably on a nuclear or thermal timescale . in previous studies , the values of @xmath21",
    "were usually estimated by only comparing the mass - radius exponents for the donor stars , which describe the response of the star and the rl to mass loss @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that mass accretion can spin up the accretor @xcite and probably result in mass loss @xcite .",
    "rapid mass accretion can drive the accreting star out of thermal equilibrium and cause it to expand , and this expansion may even cause the accretor to fill its own rl , leading to the formation of a contact binary @xcite . @xcite",
    "numerically calculated the values of @xmath22 for a grid of binaries with different values of component masses and orbital periods , considering the responses of both the donor to mass loss and the accretor to mass accretion .",
    "since the stellar expansion strongly depends on the accretion rate , they constructed three models with different assumed mass accretion histories . in model i , the mass accretion rate depends on the rotational velocity of the accretor .",
    "since a small amount of transferred material is able to spin it up to be critically rotating @xcite , there is actually very small mass accreted in this case . in model ii",
    ", it is assumed that half of the transferred mass is accreted and the other half is ejected out of binary system . in model iii ,",
    "the mass transfer is assumed to be almost conservative .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath20 vary with the orbital period , and can reach @xmath23 in model i , but are generally less than @xmath24 and @xmath25 in models ii and iii , respectively .    for unstable mass transfer , we use the standard energy conservation equation @xcite to describe the subsequent ce evolution , @xmath26 where the indices 1 and 2 denote the primary and the secondary , and i and f the initial and final values , respectively ; @xmath27 is the mass of the primary@xmath28s envelope that is ejected out of the binary during the ce phase , @xmath29 is the rl radius of the primary at the onset of rlof , and @xmath30 is the ce efficiency with which the orbital energy is used to unbind the stellar envelope .",
    "it has been pointed out that the internal energy within the envelope can also contribute to envelope ejection , and thus modify the values of @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we employ the values of @xmath17 calculated by @xcite for a range of massive and intermediate - mass stars at various evolutionary stages , and take @xmath31 = 1.0 in the calculations .",
    "we assume that nss are born from either core - collapse or electron - capture sne , depending on the masses of the progenitor stars .",
    "we follow the criterion suggested by @xcite and @xcite to distinguish them .",
    "the he core mass at the base of asymptotic giant branch is used to decide the formation of various co cores . ( 1 ) if the he core mass is less than @xmath32 , the star forms a degenerate co core and ends up forming a co wd .",
    "( 2 ) if the core is more massive than @xmath33 , the star ultimately forms a feni core and collapses to a ns .",
    "( 3 ) stars with core masses between @xmath34 and @xmath35 form partially degenerate one cores .",
    "if in subsequent evolution the core mass increases to @xmath36 , then the core collapses to a ns due to electron capture ; otherwise the star leaves an one wd . under these prescriptions , for single stars , the stellar masses for core - collapse and electron - capture sne are in the range of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the masse interval for electron - capture sne is in rough accordance with @xcite .",
    "it depends on the assumptions for mass loss and the dredge - up process in stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is blurred by mass transfer in binaries @xcite .",
    "the newborn nss are assumed to receive a kick due to asymmetric sn explosions , and we utilize a maxwellian distribution for the kick velocity , @xmath39 assuming that the directions of the kicks are isotropically distributed .",
    "we adopt @xmath40 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite for nss formed from core - collapse and electron - capture sne , respectively .",
    "the initial parameters in our bps calculation are taken as follows .",
    "all the binary orbits are assumed to be circular due to tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath42 of the primary is in the range of @xmath43 , following the initial mass function of @xcite . ] .",
    "the initial mass ratio @xmath44 has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 , but only binaries with the secondary mass @xmath45 between @xmath46 and @xmath47 are chosen .",
    "the logarithm of the orbital separation @xmath48 is uniformly distributed , lying between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we adopt solar metallicity , and assume a constant star formation rate of @xmath51 over the past 12 gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a smaller star formation rate of @xmath52 derived from _",
    "detected pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "if we adopt the latter value , the predicted number of galactic i / lmxbs will be reduced by several times , but the features of their distribution will not change .    in fig .  1",
    ", we plot the birthrates of incipient i / lmxbs as a function of the donor mass @xmath53 ( in the range of @xmath54 ) . in the left and right panels the nss",
    "are assumed to form from core - collapse and electron - capture sne , respectively .",
    "the green , red and black curves correspond to the results with the @xmath20 values from models i , ii and iii , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that , in both core - collapse and electron - capture sn channels , imxbs dominate the whole population as expected .",
    "although core - collapse sn - imxbs in model i have a birthrate higher than in other models by @xmath55 , the overall birthrate distributions do not show a remarkable difference .",
    "thus we only take the calculated birthrates in model ii in the following study , not only because it is intermediate between the other two more extreme ones , but also because the corresponding results can better match the observed distribution of be / x - ray binaries @xcite .    in fig .  2 we plot the distributions of incipient",
    "i / lmxbs in the orbital period - donor mass plane ( left panel : the core - collapse sn channel ; right panel : the electron - capture sn channel ) .",
    "after sne the binary orbits become eccentric due to mass loss and the kicks imparted on the nss . here",
    "we assume that they are quickly circularized by tidal torques with the orbital am conserved .",
    "the corresponding orbital separation is then set to be @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the semimajor axis after the sne .",
    "also shown are the histogram distributions of the birthrates , same as the red curves in fig .  1 .",
    "in the core - collapse sn channel , the ns progenitors masses are @xmath58 , the resultant i / lmxbs have orbital periods @xmath59 days , and most of them have @xmath60 a few days .",
    "the i / lmxbs birthrate roughly increases with the donor mass , because systems with lower - mass companions are more likely to merge during the ce phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in the electron - capture sn channel , the masses of the ns progenitors lie in the range @xmath61 .",
    "the primordial binaries should have orbital periods longer than @xmath62 days , otherwise the mass transfer starts too early so that a wd rather a ns is produced .",
    "the binding energies for such stars are relatively small , with the values of @xmath63 greater than unity when on asymptotic giant branch @xcite .",
    "so the resultant i / lmxbs have orbital periods in a wide range @xmath64 days , but the majority are relatively long period ( @xmath65 days ) systems .",
    "the i / lmxb birthrate slightly decreases with increasing donor mass .",
    "the reason is that , for relatively massive companion stars , the orbital periods after ce are usually long because there are sufficient orbital kinetic energies .",
    "the second mass transfer may not occur , so the primaries undergo core - collapse sne , which can readily disrupt the wide binaries .",
    "finally there are no binaries with @xmath66 day and @xmath67 , because magnetic braking ( mb ) and gravitational radiation ( gr ) can not drive these systems into contact within hubble time .",
    "based on the results in last subsection we then employ an updated version of the @xcite code to calculate the evolution of i / lmxbs . before doing this ,",
    "we first select the binaries in which mass transfer is stable so that they can evolve to be binary pulsars .",
    "super - edddinton accretion onto nss in imxbs may lead to delayed dynamical instability , and eventually ce evolution",
    ". however , there are observational and theoretical hints for mass loss from the accreting nss that can stabilize the mass transfer ( * ? ? ?",

    "the donor starts to fill its rl and initiate ( case a ) mass transfer at @xmath88 gyr when @xmath89 day , mainly driven by mb .",
    "the mass transfer rate first goes up to @xmath90yr@xmath4 , then decreases gradually as the orbital period reduces to @xmath91 day .",
    "meanwhile , the donor mass decreases to be less than @xmath92 , and the donor becomes fully convective , so mb stops working .",
    "the evolution afterwards is solely driven by gr , and the mass transfer rate drops down to @xmath93yr@xmath4 . at the end of the evolution ( the age of @xmath94 gyr ) , the donor mass and the orbital period",
    "are reduced to @xmath95 and @xmath96 day respectively .",

    "the binary finally leaves a ns with a he wd with mass of @xmath99 .",
    "the mass transfer liftime is about 0.14 gyr .",
    "the above examples suggest that , given the same donor star , the longer the initial orbital periods , the higher the averaged mass transfer rates , and the shorter the x - ray lifetimes @xcite .",
    "this strongly influences the characteristics of observable lmxbs .",
    "according to the calculated evolutionary sequences of the i / lmxbs , we plot their number distribution in the orbital period - mass transfer rate ( @xmath100 ) plane ( fig .  7 ) .",
    "the left and right panels correspond to the results with a @xmath101 and @xmath102 ns , respectively .",
    "each panel contains @xmath103 matrix elements , in which @xmath104 changes logarithmically from 0.0316 day to 1000 days with steps of 0.1 , and @xmath105 from @xmath106yr@xmath4 to @xmath107yr@xmath4 with steps of 0.125 .",
    "the color reflects the number of i / lmxbs in the corresponding matrix element by accumulating the product of the birthrates of x - ray binaries passing through it with the time - span .    a comparison of figs .",
    "4 and 7 clearly demonstrates the change in the orbital periods during the evolution of i / lmxbs . as we have already seen from figs .  5 and 6 , in x - ray binaries with initially long orbital periods ,",
    "the donors have evolved to be ( sub)giant stars at the onset of mass transfer , and the high mass transfer rates imply a short x - ray lifetime ; in short - period x - ray binaries , the donors are still on main - sequence during mass transfer , so the systems have a long - lasting mass transfer phase .",
    "this difference in the evolutionary time leads to different number distribution in fig .  7 ,",
    "which explains why most i / lmxbs tend to have relatively short orbital periods ( @xmath108 day ) .",
    "another factor that influences the number distribution of lmxbs is their transient behavior .",
    "the general idea is that , if the mass transfer rate is smaller than a critical mass transfer rate for a given orbital period , the accretion disk is likely subject to thermal and viscous instability , and the lmxb may appear as a transient x - ray source @xcite . in lmxbs irradiation from the ns",
    "may help stabilize the disk to some extent by increasing the surface temperature @xcite .",
    "the critical mass transfer rate for the disk instability is given by @xcite , @xmath109 and plotted with the red dashed line .",
    "we assume that lmxbs under this line experience short outbursts separated by long quiescent intervals .",
    "the majority of long - period lmxbs are transient sources spending most of their time in quiescence days .",
    "this puzzle can be partly understood by the transient behavior of x - ray msps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these results are consistent with @xcite , who showed that more than @xmath110 persistent ns lmxbs have main - sequence donors and orbital periods between @xmath111 hours .",
    "comparing the two panels of fig .",
    "7 also shows that , lmxbs with a heavier ns have a larger coverage in the parameter space , since mass transfer in these binaries are more likely to be stable ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    in fig .",
    "7 we also plot galactic lmxbs with known orbital periods and accretion rates . here",
    "the observational data are taken from ritter s lmxb catalogue @xcite , and from @xcite and @xcite . the filled circles and triangles represent persistent and transient lmxbs , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that most lmxbs are compact systems except two sources : cyg x@xmath732 with a @xmath112 companion star in a 9.84 day orbit @xcite , and gx13@xmath1131 ( shown with the star symbol ) , which has the longest known orbital period ( of 601.7 hours ) for a galactic ns lmxb powered by rlof @xcite .",
    "figure 8 depicts the distributions of the masses ( left panel ) and effective temperatures ( right panel ) of the donor stars .",
    "the upper and lower panels are for persistent and transient lmxbs , and the black and red lines correspond to @xmath114 and @xmath115 nss , respectively .",
    "it is seen that lmxbs dominate the population at the current epoch , because the initial phase of thermal - timescale mass transfer in imxbs , where a large fraction of the secondary mass is removed , is relatively short - lived .",
    "the donor masses in lmxbs cluster around @xmath116 .",
    "the donors temperatures are distributed in the range of @xmath117 k. figure 9 presents a more detailed comparison of the modeled orbital period ( left panel ) and accretion rate ( right panel ) distributions ( in red lines ) with observations ( in black lines ) .",
    "the upper and lower panels are for @xmath118 and @xmath115 nss , respectively .",
    "the numbers for observed sources are amplified by a factor of 500 .",
    "although there seems broad agreement between the measured and predicted orbital periods , there exist a systematic discrepancy in the accretion rates , i.e. , the calculated average accretion rates ( @xmath93yr@xmath4 ) are lower than derived from observations by about an order of magnitude .",
    "to quantitatively compare the univariate distributions of the calculated and observed quantities , we use kolmogorov - smirnov test to assist inference on their consistency @xcite .",
    "the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) for the calculated and measured orbital periods of the i / lmxbs are expressed as @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "we want to test the null hypothesis that @xmath121 for all @xmath104 , against the alternative that @xmath122 for some @xmath85 . by comparing the cdfs",
    ", we can measure the maximum distance @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the numbers of x - ray binaries in the calculation and the observation , respectively . since @xmath126 , @xmath127 . at a given significance level @xmath128",
    ", there exists a critical value @xmath129 , and @xmath130 allows rejection of the null hypothesis , indicating that the two distributions are significantly different .",
    "figure  10 shows the cdfs for the orbital period ( left panel ) and the accretion rate ( right panel ) of the i / lmxbs .",
    "the black , red and green curves represent the calculated cdfs with the ns mass of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and the observed cdf , respectively . for the orbital period distribution , we obtain @xmath131 and 1.15 with a @xmath77 and @xmath132 ns , respectively ; while for the accretion rate distribution , @xmath133 and 3.4 , suggesting that the difference is significant .",
    "we note that similar conclusions were also reached by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "one needs to be cautious that , although the numbers of lmxbs in the galactic disk with measured orbital periods and accretion rates have been substantially increased ( 51 and 45 respectively ) since then , this comparison is still severely subject to small number statistics as well as observational selection effects , e.g. , luminous sources are more likely to be observed . since in this work several key procedures involved in the formation processes of i / lmxbs have been significantly upgraded , the accretion rate discrepancy , if really exists , strongly suggests that something is missing or needs to be modified when modeling the evolution of lmxbs .    a possible mechanism that may help solve",
    "the problem is that there are extra aml mechanisms in the lmxb evolution that are not taken into account .",
    "the calculated accretion rate distribution is peaked around @xmath134 yr@xmath4 , implying that the mass transfer is driven by gr .",
    "there is similar situation in cvs , in which aml is thought to be dominated by mb and gr above and below the period gap , respectively .",
    "however , modeling cv evolution indicates that the aml rate below the period gap is @xmath135 times the gr rate @xcite , suggesting the existence of some other aml mechanisms .",
    "@xcite considered several kinds of aml mechanisms including isotropic wind from nss , outflows from the inner and outer langrangian points , and the formation of a circumbinary disk .",
    "they found that only outflow from the outer langrangian point ( or a circumbinary disk ) can account for the extra aml rate , provided that @xmath136 of the transferred mass is lost from the binary .",
    "these consequential aml mechanisms can not only substantially enhance the mass accretion rates , but also influence the value of the bifurcation periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possible origin of the accretion rate discrepancy is that the calculated secular mass transfer rate may not be identical to the accretion rate derived based on short time ( no more than @xmath137 years ) observations .",
    "for example , x - ray irradiation of the donor star may driven mass transfer cycles in lmxbs @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "once mass transfer begins , the accretion luminosity enhances the irradiation flux on the donor .",
    "thermal expansion of the donor subsequently triggers an increasing mass transfer rate ( this stage is denoted as high state ) .",
    "the donor evolves to a new thermal equilibrium state on kelvin - helmholtz timescale . when the donor nearly reaches the equilibrium state , its expansion rate decreases , then the mass transfer rate drops , and so does the irradiation flux .",
    "the donor starts to contract , and its intrinsic luminosity increases .",
    "this reduces the mass transfer to a quite low rate ( denoted as low state ) .",
    "hence the lmxb undergoes cyclic mass transfer alternating between high and low states .",
    "although spending most of their evolutionary time in low state , they are more likely to be detected in high state , in which the mass transfer rates can be significantly larger than the average ones .    in both cases mentioned above the x - ray lifetime",
    "is shortened , which can increase the birthrates of lmxbs derived from the observed number in the galactic disk .",
    "however , the detailed processes related to either extra aml loss or cyclic mass transfer are rather uncertain and depend on poorly known input parameters .",
    "numerical calculations show that irradiation in lmxbs may boost the mass transfer rates by tens of times @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argued that the mass transfer cycles are not likely to work for transient sources with an unstable disk , because irradiation can not be sustained in a long quiescent stage . to illustrate the effect of irradiation in a simplified way , we arbitrarily increase the mass transfer rates of persistent lmxbs by a factor of @xmath138 , which is randomly distributed between 1 and 30 .",
    "the corresponding evolutionary time is then reduced by the same factor .",
    "the resultant distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "11 , and we see that it seems to better match the observational data , especially for the luminous sources .",
    "the values of @xmath139 decreases to be 3.8 and 2.9 correspondingly .",
    "similar as in paper i , we follow the evolution of lmxbs to the formation of binary msps , and plot their orbital period distributions with the black lines in fig .  11 . in most cases",
    "the mass transfer terminates when the donor star loses its hydrogen - rich envelope and becomes a he or co wd . for converging lmxbs",
    ", we do not follow the evolution when the systems nearly reach the minimum periods .",
    "they might evolve to be black widow systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . at the end of each evolutionary sequence , we know the final orbital period and the secondary mass . by summing the calculated sequences , we obtain the orbital period distributions of bmsps .",
    "we assume that the lifetimes of all bmsps are @xmath140 yr , so their numbers in each bin of the orbital period depends on their birthrates .    in fig .",
    "12 we also plot the observed orbital period distributions of binary pulsars in the red lines .",
    "the upper and lower panels correspond to the initial ns mass of 1.0@xmath141 and 1.8@xmath142 , respectively .",
    "depending on the amount of the accreted mass , the nss may be fully or partially recycled .",
    "it is well known that accretion of @xmath143 material is sufficient to spin up a ns to millisecond period ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we distinguish bmsps from other partially recycled pulsars using this criterion . in the left panel",
    "we show the theoretical and observational histograms for both fully and partially recycled nss , that is , those with any accreted mass @xmath144 , and those with measured spin periods @xmath145 1 s , respectively . in the right panel",
    "we are confined with bmsps , that is , those with @xmath146 , and those with @xmath147 10 ms ( data from the atnf pulsar catalogue ; * ? ? ?",
    "the orbital periods of galactic binary pulsars extend to @xmath148 1000 days , in agreement with our calculated results with @xmath149 , while those of bmsps tend to have systematically small values .",
    "the known bmsps have orbital periods up to 200 days , longer than predicted if @xmath150 but likely compatible with that if @xmath151 .",
    "however , our calculated distributions show a shortage of bmsps with @xmath152 day , which conflicts with observations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure 13 presents the cdfs for the orbital periods of binary pulsars with @xmath153 day .",
    "similar as in fig .",
    "12 , the left and right panels correspond to all binary pulsars and bmsps , respectively .",
    "the line styles are same as in fig .",
    "there are 115 and 77 binary pulsars in the galactic disk with @xmath154 s and @xmath155 ms in the atnf pulsar catalogue , respectively .",
    "at a significance level @xmath156 , @xmath157 . in the left panel , @xmath158 and 3.9 for @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "in the right panel , @xmath161 and 2.1 for @xmath162 and @xmath160 , respectively . in both cases",
    "the @xmath163 values are larger than @xmath164 at @xmath165 days .",
    "the rarity of the predicted narrow bmsps is likely to be related to the accretion rate discrepancy discussed before , as the orbital period evolution largely depends on the mass transfer process .",
    "it is caused by the fact that in our ( and almost all previous ) calculations rlof is mainly driven by nuclear evolution of the donor or mb , so that the bifurcation period is around @xmath166 day @xcite . for binaries with initial orbital periods around it",
    ", mass transfer will finally lead to either wider or narrower orbits . only with the initial parameters in a very small parameter space",
    "can lmxbs evolve into this orbital period range .",
    "it seems that neither changing the mb law nor considering the feedback of x - ray irradiation can solve this problem in a satisfactory manner ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a relevant discussion ) .",
    "similar problems also exist for the formation of ucxbs .",
    "it was found that with the standard mb law , only a very small range of initial parameters are allowed for the binaries to evolve to ucxbs within hubble time @xcite ; if a saturated mb law is adopted , no ucxbs can be formed at all @xcite .",
    "this makes it impossible to account for the relatively large number of observed ucxbs .",
    "all these facts point to some missing ( or misunderstood ) aml mechanisms in the lmxb evolution , which will be investigated in a future work .",
    "in this work , we incorporate detailed evolutionary calculations with bps to explore the formation and evolutionary tracks of i / lmxbs in the galaxy . by this way",
    ", we can trace the evolution of the i / lmxbs from their incipient stage to the descendant binary pulsars . here",
    "we summarize the results as follows .",
    "the incipient i / lmxbs contain nss formed by both core - collapse and electron - capture sne .",
    "their orbital periods are distributed in the range of @xmath167 days and @xmath168 days , respectively .",
    "the total birthrate of galactic i / lmxb population is @xmath169 with a star formation rate of @xmath170yr@xmath4 .    \\2 .",
    "since the observability of i / lmxbs depends on the x - ray lifetimes and the stability of the accretion disks , galactic lmxbs tend to be compact binaries with orbital periods @xmath1 1 day and donor masses @xmath171 .",
    "these features are consistent with those of observed lmxbs . however , the average mass transfer rate @xmath172yr@xmath4 for persistent x - ray binaries is considerably lower than observed .",
    "the orbital periods of bmsps are predicted to extend from less than 1 day to hundreds of days , covering the majority of observed bmsps .",
    "however , the number of bmsps with @xmath165 day is severely underestimated .",
