    "the exceptional binary star , @xmath0 aurigae exhibits two year - long eclipses every 27.1 years .",
    "the eclipse of the f supergiant primary star is now understood to be caused by an opaque disk hiding a companion star ( see stencel , 2012 and references therein ) . an international effort to monitor all aspects of",
    "the 2009 - 2011 eclipse resulted in substantial archives of new data , including those involving high resolution spectroscopic monitoring , e.g. strassmeier et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and others . here",
    "we report on sampling of the high resolution spectroscopic archive generated during 2009 - 2011 eclipse , by the arces instrument at apache point observatory ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) . as discussed by strassmeier et al . ,",
    "selected spectral lines exhibit eclipse or non - eclipse behaviors , and show differential velocity effects .",
    "our purpose is to confirm and extend their findings , in light of continuing developments about the nature of this enigmatic binary star and disk system .    among the developments resulting from study of the 2009 - 2011 eclipse was recognition of third contact phenomena , interpreted as a mass transfer stream impacting the disk ( griffin & stencel 2013 ) .",
    "third contact occurred during spring 2011 , circa rjd 55,620 ( see stencel 2012 for eclipse contact times ) .",
    "evidence for this stream was seen in low excitation fe i lines and , curiously , lines of rare earth elements , blueshifted up to 45 km / sec .",
    "corroborating observations of spectral line radial velocity curves near third contact , showing similar effects , were reported by kambe et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and sadakane et al .",
    "strassmeier et al .",
    "presumably would have detected similar spectral features if their robotic stella spectrometer had not been off - line during those portions of the eclipse .",
    "arces observers maintained a steady cadence through all of the eclipse phases and thus provide a more detailed picture of third contact phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the new spectroscopic observations ( sections 2 , 3 and 4 ) , followed by an evolutionary context ( section 5 ) , shape and cloudy models for the system ( sections 6 and 7 ) , and conclusions in section 8 .",
    "the arces instrument is an echelle spectrograph commissioned in 1999 for use with the arc ( astrophysical research consortium ) 3.5 m telescope located at the apache point observatory [ http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/instruments/arces/ - doi : 10.1117/12.461447 ] .",
    "arces main optics consist of an off - axis parabolidal collimator , an echelle grating , two cross - dispersing prisms , and an f/2.7 schmidt camera with achromatic correctors . since its commission , arces has been primarily used for observations of stellar abundances and as a tool for surveying diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) .",
    "important features of this instrument include : a 2.5 pixel resolution of 31,500 ( 9 km / s ) , a spectral range of 3200a-10000a , an s / n @xmath4 3000 , and remote operability .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of the entire telescope plus spectrograph system has been determined to be greater than 2.2% at 647 nm and the spectrograph has been estimated to have an efficiency of 8% and 2% at 630 nm .",
    "some limitations of this instrument include a slight drift throughout nightly observations of about 0.5 pixels over 10 hours .",
    "this drift occurs mostly during the first half of the night and is likely due to thermal changes in the double - prism system as temperatures raise and lower .",
    "this has been accounted for by interpolating values between hourly calibrations .",
    "overall , arces has been proven to be a stable , reliable instrument that has many uses in astronomical observations .    similarly , triplespec is a near - ir spectrometer built for the arc 3.5 meter telescope at apache point observatory ( apo : http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/instruments/triplespec/1 ) .",
    "spectral coverage ranges between 0.95 and 2.46 microns , with 2.1 spectral pixel resolution of 3500 with the 1.1 arcsec slit .",
    "steps in the data reduction described by wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) include : ( 1 ) extracting spectra from raw ccd frames ; ( 2 ) applying deblazing and wavelength standardization ; ( 3 ) applying heliocentric rv - corrections , but no telluric corrections were attempted .",
    "arces and triplespec observations of @xmath0 aurigae are listed in table 1 , including date and reduced julian date plus an estimate of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) based on continuum signal statistics as described below . to achieve high - accuracy rv measurements with the echelle spectrograph",

    "one problem with shape was the tendency for files to be unsaved or deleted in between opening and working with them .",
    "shape was used to interpret and model the mass transfer stream observed during third contact .",
    "a small sphere was set in the center of the frame and surrounded by a disk , representing the b star and the accretion disk .",
    "the primary f star is set in the background at roughly third contact and there are two separate `` clouds '' representing the observed mass transfer stream .",
    "the cloud farther out from the disk represents the higher velocity component that is illuminated by the f star first , and then transitions into the slower , closer in cloud as the eclipse ends . the deceleration from -60 km / s to -40",
    "km / s over the projected distance of one f star radius is indicative of an 8 solar mass central star inside the disk , assuming the disk radius scale derived by kloppenborg et al .",

    "one challenging aspect of the stream velocity at third contact is why it only appears between rjd 55600 and 55650 , which is only 0.3 percent of the orbital phase .",
    "this suggests the higher speed stream closely parallels the edge of the opaque disk .",

    "cloudy includes the 30 lightest elements in its calculations and the relative concentrations of these elements can be modified .",

    "certain parameters had to be specified in order to generate a continuum file that would contain the calculated intensities over our selected range of wavelengths . for the input parameters we varied log temperature and log density , to see their effect on the line strength , while other parameters such as geometry , radius , and chemical abundances were not varied .",
    "temperature was run from 15000k to 30000k with a step size of 2500k , or in log terms , from 4.17 to 4.47 .",

    "the result was that log n = 10.5 .",
    "figures 10 and 11 suggest that for log n = 11 then t=15000k provides a good fit for the equivalent width of both he 10830 and for h - alpha .",

    "spectroscopic monitoring of @xmath0 aurigae during its recent eclipse , using the apache point observatory arces and triplespec instruments , has helped detail substructure in the disk and stream at selected phases . in particular ,",
    "the amplitude of the disk velocity is better defined and the appearance and velocity of the stream is more well defined .",
    "variations in the he i 10830  absorption line strength during mid - eclipse was shown to relate to the inner disk structure .",
    "hydrogen pa@xmath1 exhibits a p cygni profile during third contact , suggestive of an expansion zone related to stream impact zone .",
    "having defined special phases around third contact , ideally more targeted observations can be arranged during the next third contact time - frame , in particular ( rjd 65510 or 2038 march 28 ) .    one hope resulting from study of these data is another attempt to determine the distance to the @xmath0 aurigae system - much debated in the literature .",
    "recent work by guinan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) claimed to constrain distance estimates to @xmath8 kpc , using correlations between distance measurements to stars in the vicinity of @xmath0 aur with interstellar absorption and reddening properties .",
    "however , that study rests on several assumptions , including uniformity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , enforcing strictly linear correlations between distance - sensitive properties , and spectral type calibration uncertainties that factor into their mesa models and distance moduli .",
    "distances based on different dibs disagree with each other , so reliance on a single one also can be highly suspect friedman et al .",
    "each of these assumptions contribute to a substantial cumulative uncertainty in their distance estimate .",
    "it is instructive to note that several binary stars exist in the @xmath0 aurigae field .",
    "for example , b - type stars are fairly common within a few degrees , and indications are that the @xmath0 aurigae primary could have arisen from a b - type main sequence star , and its disk may contain a b - type secondary star .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 aurigae has a moderate eccentricity @xmath9 stefanik et al .",
    "two neighbor stars , which also are guinan et al . sample stars , turn out to be high eccentricity b - star binaries . these stars are hd 31894 ( e=0.61 , estimated stellar mass of 9m@xmath10 ) and hd 31617 ( e=0.76 , estimated primary stellar mass of 9 to 15m@xmath10 ) .",
    "the formation of such binaries represents a challenge to star forming theories .",
    "another neighbor , hd 30353 ( a5iap ) , is suggested to be a case c mass transfer binary ( lauterborn 1970 ) .",
    "collectively , are these clues to binary star evolution in this region of our galaxy ?",
    "we argue that this may be so , and explore the implications thereof .",
    "the distance moduli for these b star binaries and angular proximity to @xmath0 aurigae argue for a distance less than 1kpc .",
