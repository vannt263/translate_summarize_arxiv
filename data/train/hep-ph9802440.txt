    "a few years ago l. mclerran and r. venugopalan@xcite introduced an interesting program of studying the small x gluon distribution , and gluon production , involving a very large nucleus .",
    "the essential idea is to use the valence quarks of the nucleus as a source for a light - cone gauge calculation , involving only tree graphs , of the weizscker - williams(ww ) field of the nucleus .",
    "the higher momentum components of this ww field , interpreted in terms of gluon quanta , would then be included with the valence quarks to give a new source which could be used to calculate another momentum layer of ww quanta , etc .",
    "this program is being actively pursued@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the ww field of the valence quarks of a large nucleus is a nontrivial problem because of the nonlinearity due to the strong source coming from the many valence quarks of the large nucleus .",
    "it was calculated independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was observed in this ( quasi - classical ) ww approximation that the gluon distribution for a large nucleus is strongly modified from what one would expect from adding the distributions of the individual nucleons incoherently .",
    "an apparent saturation of the gluon distribution sets in at moderate to low gluon transverse momenta while the high transverse momentum part of the ww single particle gluon distribution remains additive .",
    "however , some time ago@xcite it was observed that there are no shadowing corrections , in this @xmath1 approximation .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to show the compatibility of the @xmath2 result with the result of ref.5 and to interpret that latter result . to do this",
    "we introduce a _ current _",
    "@xmath3 and calculate deep inelastic scattering of this current off a large nucleus in an approximation where the nucleons in the nucleus have no qcd evolution included in their gluon distributions .",
    "we suppose @xmath4 but the parameter @xmath5 , with  a  the atomic number , will generally be taken to be large .",
    "we do our calculation first in covariant gauge and then in an appropriate light - cone gauge in order to interpret the result of ref.5 .",
    "it is convenient to consider two distinct regimes of gluon production in the deep inelastic scattering of the current  j  off a large nucleus .",
    "if @xmath6 is the virtuality of the current and if @xmath7 is the typical transverse momentum that a high energy gluon obtains by multiple scattering with the nucleons as it passes through the nucleus@xcite , then these two regimes are characterized by @xmath8 and by @xmath9 we begin by describing our results when @xmath10    in small  x  deep inelastic scattering , and in covariant gauge , the current  j  produces a gluon locally in the nucleus@xcite .",
    "this gluon then multiply scatters , both elastically and inelastically , as it passes through the nucleus@xcite .",
    "the equation for the transverse momentum distribution of the produced gluon is given in ( 6 ) below .",
    "the solution , given in ( 18 ) and ( 21 ) , is exactly the one found in @xcite for the gluon correlation function .",
    "this distribution does not reflect shadowing , but rather the probability conserving final state interactions which modify the transverse momentum distribution of the produced gluon but not the cross section for its production . in an @xmath11 light - cone gauge calculation , in a frame where the nucleus is right - moving and the current left - moving , we find a complete absence of final state interactions and we give a physical picture of why this happens . here the effect of the final state interaction which we found in covariant gauge is encoded in the light - cone wavefunction of the nucleus .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the distribution of gluons in the ww wavefunction gives the correct transverse momentum distribution of produced gluons without any final state interactions whatever .",
    "the traditional gluon distribution @xmath12 can be obtained by integrating the produced gluon distribution over all transverse momenta obeying @xmath13 because @xmath14 in the logarithmic approximation , one can view the current  j  as measuring the gluon distribution in the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "when @xmath15 the covariant gauge calculation of the produced gluon spectrum does not change in form from that when @xmath16 since the large @xmath17 comes from final state interactions which appear after the production of the gluon occurs .",
    "the light - cone gauge calculation now appears more complicated .",
    "the three and four gluon terms in  j  become important and final state interactions are not negligible .",
    "the current is no longer sufficiently pointlike to be viewed as measuring the partonic gluon distribution of the nucleus .",
    "if we construct @xmath12 from its moments , @xmath18 in terms of nuclear matrix elements of the normal local gluon operators , with the counter terms taken to be the same as for nucleon matrix elements , then @xmath12 is additive @xmath19 it appears that this object has no direct connection with partonic gluons in the light - cone wavefunction of the nucleus when @xmath20 it is perhaps surprising that the gluon distribution in the light - cone wavefunction is still the same as the produced gluon spectrum . finally , while the gluon distribution in the light - cone wavefunction is very different from the incoherent nucleon light - cone distributions when @xmath21 the nuclear modifications are simply probability conserving redistributions in phase space and so are unrelated to nuclear shadowing .",
    "in sec.3 we calculate gluon production in a nucleon - nucleus collision . in a calculation equivalent to a covariant gauge calculation we view the gluon as being produced in one of two ways .",
    "( i ) the gluon may be present in the wavefunction of the hadron as the hadron reaches the front face of the nucleus . in that case interactions with nucleons in the nucleus free",
    "the gluon and multiple scattering in the nucleus broadens its transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "( ii ) the gluon may be radiated in the final state from fragments of the incident hadron . in that case the transverse momentum spectrum of the gluon is not affected by the nucleus .",
    "interference terms between initial and final state emission are small . in an @xmath11 light - cone gauge calculation of gluon production from the collision of a right - moving nucleus with a left - moving nucleon",
    "no final state interactions appear .",
    "if @xmath22 is the field of the nucleus while @xmath23 is the field of the nucleon gauge rotated@xcite by those nucleons in the nucleus having the same impact parameter then the gluon production cross section is obtained by coupling @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the qcd radiation field in a way determined by the qcd lagrangian .",
    "a very simple expression emerges for the cross section as given by ( 73)-(75 ) .",
    "in this section , we consider deep inelastic scattering off a large nucleus where the ( gauge invariant ) current initiating the scattering is taken to be @xmath24 with @xmath25 the usual qcd field strength tensor .",
    "we choose this current because it furnishes the most direct way to measure the gluon distribution and to produce a gluon and follow its interactions with the nucleons of the nucleus as it passes into the final state .",
    "we neglect qcd evolution in the interaction of  j  with the individual nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "our calculation of the gluon distribution is closely related to that of ref.5 with which we are in agreement .",
    "our motivation for neglecting qcd evolution , and we shall explain below in what sense we neglect it , is the same as in ref.1 .",
    "we are interested in a model to illustrate particular small  x  and nuclear effects .",
    "we shall later comment on our expectations in a realistic nucleus .",
    "there is a surprisingly different picture of gluon production in covariant gauge as compared to light - cone gauge . in covariant gauge , and in the rest systems of the nucleus , the current  j  produces a gluon off a nucleon in the nucleus in a reasonably local way .",
    "this gluon then has final state interactions with nucleons along its path as it passes through the nucleus@xcite .",
    "the final state interactions change the transverse momentum distribution of the produced gluon , but they do not modify the production rate . thus the gluon distribution , and the structure function , of the nucleus is additive in the atomic number and",
    "there is no shadowing . in light - cone gauge , at least in a particular light - cone gauge , there are no final state interactions whatever .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the produced gluon is already encoded in the wavefunction of the nucleus . after deriving this result",
    "we shall give a simple physical picture why final state interactions are not present in our light - cone gauge .",
    "we begin with the scattering of @xmath26 off a single nucleon as illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "define a structure function    @xmath27 in analogy with deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering .",
    "then , from the graph in fig.1 it is straightforward to show    @xmath28    which can be factorized as    @xmath29    with  x  the usual bjorken variable , @xmath30 and @xmath31 a constant .",
    "( the feynman rules for coupling  j  to two gluons are given in ref.6 . )",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( 2b ) corresponds to gluon operators in the operator product expansion while the second term corresponds to quark operators .",
    "as discussed in some detail in ref.6 the nucleons are additive in our approximation so that    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the structure function and the gluon distribution for the nucleus .",
    "indeed , additivity is closely related to our treatment of the gluon - hadron amplitude , the lower _ blob _ in fig.1 .",
    "we suppose that there are no @xmath36 factors in that amplitude and we also assume that the gluon - nucleon amplitude vanishes as @xmath37 becomes large .",
    "that is , we suppose that high mass intermediate states are not present in the gluon - nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "these @xmath38 limit the longitudinal coherence length of the forward current - nucleon scattering amplitude to be not significantly larger than the nucleon size , which means that the interaction is local in the nucleus .",
    "now let us follow a gluon , produced by an interaction of  j  with a nucleon in the nucleus , as it scatters with other nucleons in the nucleus as illustrated fig.2 where we have shown examples of both inelastic and elastic scattering in the nucleus .",
    "it is convenient to define a probability distribution for the gluon to have a transverse momentum @xmath39 as it passes through the nucleus@xcite .",
    "if the gluon is produced with a transverse momentum @xmath40 at a longitudinal coordinate @xmath41 and at an impact parameter @xmath42 with respect to the center of the nucleus , let @xmath43 be the probability distribution for the gluon to have transverse momentum @xmath39 at a longitudinal position z. of course    @xmath44    while the number density of produced gluons in the nucleus is    @xmath45    where the integration @xmath46 goes over the volume of the nucleus , @xmath47 is the nuclear density normalized to the atomic number  a  by    @xmath48    and we take the nuclear density to be uniform throughout the nucleus for simplicity .",
    "the initial distribution resulting from an interaction of the current  j  with a nucleon in the nucleus is normalized to be given by the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleon    @xmath49\\eqno(8)\\ ] ]    where , in our approximation , there is no x - dependence in @xmath50 and there is no @xmath51dependence in @xmath52 for large @xmath53    now  f  obeys the equation ( see eqs.2.7 and 2.8 of ref.12 .",
    "appendix a of that reference gives a derivation . )",
    "@xmath54    with    @xmath55    and where    @xmath56    is the normalized gluon - nucleon scattering amplitude with @xmath57 the momentum transfer and where    @xmath58^{-1},\\eqno(12)\\ ] ]    is the mean free path of gluons in the nuclear matter . for notational simplicity",
    "we suppress the @xmath59 dependence of f. the first ( inelastic ) interaction of the produced gluon shown in fig.2 is contained in the second term in ( 9 ) while the second ( elastic ) interaction comes from the first term in ( 9 ) .",
    "we work in an approximation where the gluon - nucleon cross section is energy independent , at high energy , and where the gluon s helicity is conserved during the scatterings in the nucleus .",
    "eq.9 is solved by going to a transverse coordinate representation    @xmath60    as usual in the high energy limit the transverse coordinate of the gluon will not change as the gluon passes through the nucleus , and thus , using ( 13 ) in ( 9 ) gives    @xmath61    with    @xmath62    and where    @xmath63    with    @xmath64    now defining    @xmath65    one easily finds from ( 6 ) that    @xmath66    the solution to ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) is clearly    @xmath67    leading to    @xmath68)\\eqno(21a)\\ ] ]    or    @xmath69)\\eqno(21b)\\ ] ]    where we have used ( see eq.4.7 and appendix b of ref.12 . )    @xmath70    valid in a logarithmic approximation for small @xmath71 ( our notation is such that @xmath72 is not the fourier transform of @xmath73 but rather stands for @xmath74    eq.(21 ) is the same result found in ref.5 . in the limit of very small @xmath75",
    "one can keep only the first two terms in the expansion of the exponential in ( 21 ) to arrive at    @xmath76    which , with the identification of the nuclear gluon distribution with @xmath77 gives    @xmath78    at first sight it would seem that ( 24 ) no longer holds for extremely large nuclei at fixed @xmath75 where    @xmath79    however ( 24 ) is still correct . what fails is the identification of @xmath80 with @xmath81 when  a  is very large .",
    "the physics here is quite clear .",
    "the current  j  makes a ( local ) hard interaction with one of the nucleons in the nucleus and produces a gluon .",
    "the coherence length for this production is small and so the production cross section , and hence the nuclear gluon distribution @xmath82 is incoherent among the nucleons in the nucleus@xcite .",
    "the quantity which is calculated in ( 6 ) and ( 21 ) is the momentum distribution of produced gluons , and the @xmath83 in ( 21 ) is conjugate to the @xmath39 of the produced gluon but has no natural connection with the @xmath84 of the current when  a  is very large . when  a  is not too large , and the final state interactions do not change the momentum of the produced gluon too much , _ and if _ one takes a cutoff on @xmath85 equal to the @xmath84 of the current , then @xmath86 can be identified with @xmath87 and ( 23 ) holds .",
    "however , when the final state interactions give a broadening of the transverse momentum distribution @xmath88 which is large compared to @xmath84 then @xmath89 has no relation to the nuclear gluon distribution .      in a light - cone gauge calculation of gluon production one",
    "must also arrive at ( 21 ) and ( 24 ) .",
    "indeed ( 21 ) has already been obtained in ref.5 using a light - cone gauge although the interpretation of what exactly was calculated is , perhaps , not so straightforward . in this section , we calculate gluon production in @xmath90 light - cone gauge .",
    "we restrict our discussion to @xmath91 we shall find ( 21 ) although we shall see that there are no final state interactions when @xmath92 the transverse momentum distribution of the produced gluon now comes from the wavefunction of the nucleus .",
    "we begin by showing that final state interactions are absent .",
    "the only unusual aspect of our calculation is the way we choose the @xmath93 in the light - cone gauge propagator . with the momentum",
    "as indicated in fig.3 our light - cone gauge propagator is    @xmath94.\\eqno(26)\\ ] ]    this choice was used in ref.11 and implicitly in refs.4 and 5 .",
    "if @xmath95 then the choice of @xmath96 in ( 26 ) dictates that a charge at an @xmath97 coordinate @xmath98 gauge rotates all charges having @xmath99 but does not gauge rotate charges with @xmath100      in order to understand why final state interactions do not appear in deep inelastic scattering in light - cone gauge it is useful to begin with the example of gluon production off a quark in one nucleon and the subsequent rescattering of the gluon off a quark in another nucleon as illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "the quarks are assumed to be right - movers and the produced gluon , @xmath101 is assumed to obey @xmath102 the quarks are on - shell before and after the scattering while the quark having @xmath103 is taken to have its @xmath104-coordinate to be greater than the @xmath104-coordinate of @xmath105 so that it is natural to expect a production of the gluon off quark 1 and a later rescattering off quark 2 .",
    "the @xmath106 symbols along the quark lines in fig.4 indicate that the @xmath107 matrices will be dominant , as usual when considering soft gluon production .",
    "the relevant factors for the graph shown in fig.4a are    @xmath108}[(k-\\ell + q)_\\beta(k-\\ell)_\\alpha - g_{\\alpha\\beta}(k-\\ell)\\cdot(k+q-\\ell)]\\ ] ]    @xmath109}\\ [ g_{\\beta\\gamma}-{\\eta_\\beta(k-\\ell)_\\gamma\\over ( k-\\ell)_++i\\epsilon } -{\\eta_\\gamma(k-\\ell)_\\beta\\over ( k-\\ell)_+-i\\epsilon}]\\ ] ]    @xmath110    we now carry out an integration over @xmath111 recalling that @xmath112 follows from @xmath113 and @xmath114 while @xmath115 follows from the fact that we are considering small - x deep inelastic scattering with @xmath116 we take transverse components of @xmath117 to be zero . )",
    "before doing the @xmath118 integration we use the slavnov - taylor - ward ( stw ) identities to drop the @xmath119 part of the gluon propagator @xmath120 as this term cancels between the three graphs , ( a - c ) , of fig.4 . after this term",
    "is dropped only the @xmath121 has a singularity in the lower half @xmath122 plane .",
    "we can do the @xmath123 integration by distorting the contour in the lower half @xmath122 plane so long as the rest of the integrand , the other terms in @xmath124 vanish for large values of @xmath125 and if that is the case the net result will be small because the final evaluation is done at @xmath126 so that inverse powers of @xmath118 correspond to higher inverse powers of @xmath84 as compared to the case of no rescattering . in order to count the @xmath122 factors in @xmath127",
    "it is convenient to write    @xmath128    then in order to compensate for the @xmath129 and @xmath130 denominators , not including the possible denominator in ( 28 ) , one would need a @xmath131 coming from the numerator terms in order not to have a small result .",
    "this means that one must get a single factor of @xmath118 ( or @xmath132 ) each from the @xmath133 term and from the @xmath134_{\\beta\\alpha}-$ ] term in ( 27 ) . in order to get a @xmath122 factor from @xmath135",
    "an accompanying @xmath136 , @xmath137 or @xmath138 must appear .",
    "but @xmath137 clearly gives zero from ( 27 ) while @xmath139 gives zero , or an extra @xmath118 in the denominator , from ( 28 ) so we are left with @xmath140 as the only possibility .",
    "here we can simplify our discussion by choosing @xmath141 this is perhaps an unusual choice to go with @xmath142 light - cone gauge but , after all , one is free to choose the @xmath143 polarizations in any convenient basis . with the choice @xmath144",
    "we find    @xmath145    ( we could arrive at this result somewhat more directly . after observing that there is sufficient convergence to do the @xmath122 integration by distorting in the lower half plane we could use current conservation in the @xmath146-index of the @xmath147vertex along with @xmath148 to get ( 29 ) .",
    "however , it does not seem possible to generalize this procedure to all higher order graphs . )",
    "the choice @xmath149 also makes graphs  b  and  cof fig.4 equal to zero because one can not have a @xmath107 matrix with this polarization vector .",
    "thus we are left only with the graph shown in fig.4d and we must also evaluate it with @xmath150 now    @xmath151}\\ { -i k_\\sigma^\\perp\\over \\b{k}^2(k_+-i\\epsilon ) } \\epsilon_\\nu\\gamma_{\\alpha\\sigma\\nu}^q\\eqno(30)\\ ] ]    where    @xmath152    again , in doing the @xmath118 integration we will end up with a @xmath132 in the denominator , giving a small result , unless one can take a @xmath111 or a @xmath153 from @xmath154 as given in ( 31 ) .",
    "but , taking a @xmath111 or a @xmath153 from @xmath154 will result in a factor of @xmath155 , @xmath137 or @xmath156 each of which give zero in ( 30 ) .",
    "we have seen that the graphs of fig.4 give a small contribution .",
    "( we have reached the conclusion for @xmath92 of course we would have found a small result for @xmath157 large independently of the size of @xmath158 but that is no different than in covariant gauge .",
    "the fact that final state interactions are suppressed for large @xmath158 and with @xmath159 is different than what we found in covariant gauge . ) in a moment we shall give a physical argument explaining why this is not unexpected .",
    "however , before describing our physical argument consider the high energy gluon quark scattering amplitude at order @xmath146 in @xmath11 light - cone gauge and in a frame where the quark is right - moving and the gluon left - moving .",
    "the graphs are shown in fig.5 . if we choose @xmath160 for the initial and final gluons , then only the first graph in fig.5 contributes .",
    "the essential factors in this graph are    @xmath161    the on - shell conditions @xmath162 and @xmath163 give @xmath164 in order to see how the high energy limit comes about it is useful to write    @xmath165    @xmath166 gives zero while acting in ( 32 ) while @xmath167 gives a small factor .",
    "using    @xmath168    gives    @xmath169    of course , the result emerges directly from an evaluation of ( 32 ) without explicitly invoking current conservation , ( 33 ) . in a frame where @xmath170 is large the high energy growth , the factor of @xmath171 in ( 35 ) ,",
    "comes partly from the smallness of @xmath118 in the denominator in ( 32 ) . in order to get a small denominator it is crucial to have a long region of integration over @xmath172 the variable conjugate to @xmath125 of course the quark and gluon are far apart",
    "when @xmath104 is large , but in axial gauge important interactions can happen in a non - causal manner . in our choice of light - cone gauge , ( 26 )",
    ", the factor @xmath173 in ( 32 ) comes from times long before the quark and gluon have reached each other .",
    "we are now in a position to see why final state interactions can not be important in single gluon production in light - cone gauge in deep inelastic scattering . in fig.4a and its higher",
    "order counterparts a final state interaction occurs much like the one we have just considered . in order for this final state interaction to be important one would need a trapping of the @xmath122 integration contour at values of @xmath118 on the order of @xmath174 but from ( 27 ) we see that we can distort the @xmath118-contour so that @xmath118 is always of size @xmath175 because @xmath84 is a large parameter @xmath118 is not forced to be small , and thus final state interactions are weak .",
    "we can say this slightly differently . the highly off - shell current has a lifetime @xmath176 and",
    "this is the limiting @xmath104 over which integrations can be done .",
    "this @xmath177 is not large enough to generate the small light - cone denominators necessary to have final state interactions , at least so long as the target is not too long compared to its longitudinal momentum , that is so long as @xmath178      we begin by considering deep inelastic scattering in a nucleus where two separate nucleons are involved in the scattering .",
    "the two classes of graphs are illustrated in fig.6 .",
    "the graphs of fig.6a correspond to inelastic scattering off both nucleon 1 and off nucleon 2 while graphs in the class of fig.6b correspond to an inelastic reaction with nucleon 1 and an elastic reaction with nucleon 2 .",
    "we emphasize that in our frame where the nucleons are right - movers and the current  qhas @xmath179 the @xmath104- coordinate of nucleon 1 is less than the @xmath180 coordinate of nucleon 2 .",
    "the interactions shown in fig.6 are nonzero only when the propagator of the @xmath181line is taken to be @xmath182[k_+-i\\epsilon]}$ ] and similarly for the @xmath183line .",
    "( we suppose @xmath184 while @xmath185 is integrated freely over values large compared to @xmath186 as is appropriate for a low x collision where the produced gluon has a coherence length large compared to the length of the nucleus . )",
    "our gauge choice , as indicated in ( 26 ) , allows the gluon field of a nucleon to have a pure gauge part which extends in the negative @xmath187direction starting from that nucleon .",
    "as shown in detail in ref.11 this field gauge rotates the field of nucleons having smaller values of @xmath188 thus , the field of nucleon 2 rotates the field coming from nucleon 1 .",
    "now let us evaluate explicitly the graphs in fig.6 starting with those in fig.6a .",
    "the @xmath181line of that figure goes from nucleon 2 to nucleon 1 or to the field coming from nucleon 1 . because of the @xmath166 at the end of the @xmath181line we can use the stw identities to evaluate these contributions",
    "this has already been done in ref.11 and here we need only outline the procedure and put in the normalizations appropriate for our problem . in doing the @xmath122 integration",
    "we distort over the @xmath189 pole if the light - cone propagator which sets @xmath190 since @xmath191 compared to @xmath170 the @xmath181line , which by the stw identities eliminates the @xmath192-propagator , effectively inserts a transverse momentum @xmath193 just before the attachment of the current q. in terms of formulas    @xmath194    where @xmath195 is the triple gluon vertex , @xmath196 the gluon propagator and @xmath197 the vertex of the current  @xmath198  with the gluon lines @xmath199 and @xmath200 the omitted terms in ( 36 ) cancel with gluon , @xmath201 attachments into the lower _ blob _ of nucleon 1 . in exactly the same way , and integrating over @xmath202 the gluon line @xmath203 also eliminates the @xmath199 line in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "thus , the stw identities allow one to calculate the effect of nucleon 2 on the field coming from nucleon 1 .",
    "we may write the gluon production amplitude in terms of the scattering of the current off the gluon @xmath204 as illustrated in fig.7 , times the unintegrated gluon distribution coming from nucleon 1 as modified by nucleon 2 . rather than immediately writing the answer for the two nucleon case we instead proceed to the general case using the `` classical '' field calculated in ref.4 to generate the tree graphs contributing to the unintegrated gluon distribution coming from an arbitrary number of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "we change notation slightly from ref.4 to better match the problem at hand .",

    "therefore we can average these terms independently of the rest of the expression in ( 45 ) , as well as do the transverse integrations .",
    "taking only the two - density correlation terms ( we throw away the higher order correlations since they have more powers of  @xmath244  which goes beyond the classical approximation@xcite ) and making use of ( 39 ) we end up with    @xmath245>\\ ] ] @xmath246    @xmath247>,\\eqno(47)\\ ] ]    where @xmath248 is the absolute value of the change in longitudinal coordinate .",

    "thus one indeed is able to calculate the produced gluon spectrum from the `` classical '' field given in ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) and this accounts for the final state interactions which are present in covariant gauge .",
    "in this section we shall calculate the spectrum of gluons produced in the scattering of a nucleon off a large nucleus . if the nucleus is right - moving and the nucleon left - moving",
    "then we suppose the centrally produced gluon momentum , @xmath101 is such that @xmath170 is much less than the minus component of the nucleon momentum and that @xmath186 is sufficiently less than the momentum of a nucleon in the nucleus so that the gluon is coherent over the longitudinal extent of the nucleus .",
    "we begin our discussion with gluon production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "we choose @xmath258 gauge and a center of mass system to describe gluon production .",
    "if we choose the outgoing gluon polarization such that @xmath259 then we need only consider the graph shown in fig.8 for the gluon production amplitude . the terms occurring at the 3-gluon vertex in that graph are                  and using the fact that @xmath270 gives zero by current conservation while @xmath271 gives a very small result one can replace @xmath272 by @xmath273 the @xmath274 will cancel the @xmath275 denominator in ( 51 ) ( and in ( 52 ) ) so that in each case the vertices @xmath47 and @xmath276 are multiplied by the appropriate factors for the cross section to be given by the product of the unintegrated gluon distributions of nucleons @xmath105 and @xmath277 the result is@xcite-@xcite .      where @xmath279 and  y  is the rapidity of the produced gluon .",

    "if @xmath85 is not large there is no hard scale and the unintegrated gluon distributions do not have much meaning . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath85 is large then the cross section is better expressed as the product of two gluon distributions times a hard scattering cross section .",
    "nevertheless , ( 54 ) is useful as a normalization and for comparison with the equations we are now going to derive for gluon production in nucleon - nucleus collisions .",
    "it also follows in a bfkl approximation@xcite .",
    "it is not too difficult to calculate the cross section for producing a gluon of transverse momentum @xmath39 in the collision of a nucleon with a large nucleus .",
    "it is convenient to view the calculation in the rest system of the nucleus .",
    "we suppose the longitudinal momentum of the gluon is large enough so that the gluon is coherent over the length of the nucleus@xcite .",
    "we begin by considering gluon radiation when a quark scatters on a nucleus .",
    "it will then be a simple matter to extend the result to an incoming nucleon .",
    "it is convenient to work in @xmath280 gauge and with @xmath149 where we choose the incoming quark to have a large minus component of momentum .",
    "suppose the quark reaches the nucleon at light - cone time @xmath281 then we separate the gluon radiation cross section into four terms depending on the time @xmath282 that the gluon is emitted from the quark in the amplitude and on the time @xmath283 that the gluon is emitted from the quark in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the four cases are :      since the coherence time of the gluon is assumed to be much bigger than the radius of the nucleus we can assume that the quark , or the quark - gluon system , passes over the nucleus instantaneously compared to the magnitudes of the times of emission @xmath282 and @xmath288 also once we separate contributions into definite times we are in effect dealing with light - cone perturbation theory rather than with feynman graphs though in many graphs the orderings ( 55 ) simply tell whether the gluon is emitted before or after the quark , or quark - gluon system , interacts with the nucleus .",
    "the cross sections coming from the regions ( 55 ) are given by the expressions          in the above we take the transverse coordinate of the quark to be @xmath293 while @xmath294 and @xmath295 are the transverse coordinates of the gluon in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude respectively .",
    "we use a shorthand notation where @xmath296 means @xmath297 with @xmath298 and @xmath42 as previously used in sec.2 .",
    "let us now see how ( 56 ) to ( 58 ) come about .    in ( 56 ) the factor",
    "@xmath299 is just the product of the coordinate space gluon emission amplitude times the complex conjugate amplitude . what may seem surprising in ( 56 )",

    "the feynman diagram contribution to this process would be zero by energy conservation .",
    "however , ( 56 ) corresponds to @xmath282 and @xmath283 greater than zero so we do not yet have energy conservation .",
    "there are other terms in ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) which can be viewed as cancelling this `` gluon radiation without interaction '' term .",
    "indeed these are the @xmath300-independent terms of ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) .",
    "however , the grouping of terms as given in ( 56)-(58 ) is convenient for our purposes .",
    "now turn to ( 58 ) .",
    "the exponential term in ( 61 ) reflects multiple scattering of the gluon as it passes through a length @xmath301 of nuclear matter .",
    "this factor is identical to that given by ( 20 ) with @xmath302 taken to be @xmath303 in this case it is the quark - gluon system which passes through the nucleus both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "interactions of the quark with the nucleons in the nucleus cancel between real and virtual ( production and elastic scattering ) terms .",
    "the expression ( 57 ) corresponds to a quark - gluon system passing through the nucleus in the amplitude and a quark passing through the nucleus in the complex conjugate amplitude along with a term where the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude terms are exchanged . in appendix",
    "a we outline how the exponential factors , involving @xmath304 and @xmath305 come about .                        with @xmath83 and @xmath315 in ( 63 ) and ( 64 )",
    "related to @xmath316 and @xmath295 in ( 58 ) by @xmath317 .",
    "the second plus third terms in the brackets on the right - hand side of ( 61 ) are non - logarithmic when @xmath318 when @xmath319 this term exactly cancels similar terms in ( 59 ) and ( 60 ) .",

    "when an incident nucleon passes through a nucleus all the gluons in the nucleon s wavefunction having @xmath325 are freed during the collision and the final state interactions broaden their distribution .",
    "this is the second term on the right - hand side of ( 66 ) and one half of ( 67 ) .",
    "the nucleon remnants emerging from the nucleus have lost their gluon cloud . in rebuilding that cloud",
    "there is further gluon emission , but this gluon emission has no transverse momentum broadening .",

    "it is relatively straightforward to derive a general formula for @xmath327 in terms of classical fields associated with the colliding nucleon and nucleus . to see how this comes about we discuss in detail the scattering of a left - moving nucleon on two right - moving nucleons .",
    "we begin with the graphs shown in fig.9 where we suppose that nucleons 1 and 2 are right - moving and that the @xmath328 coordinate of nucleon 1 is less than that of nucleon 2 , that is , nucleon 1 is ahead of nucleon 2 .",
    "we assume these nucleons are separated by a longitudinal distance large compared to @xmath329 in their common rest system .",
    "then the interaction in fig.9a must be a gauge term with the effective part of the k - propagator being @xmath330}.$ ] the phase factor @xmath331 dictates that one distort the contour in the upper - half plane with the propagator becoming @xmath332 similarly for the graph in fig.9b one can again distort the propagator in the upper half @xmath122plane getting an identical result for the @xmath181 propagator .",
    "one now can use the stw identities to arrive at a contribution which is illustrated in fig.10 where the dotted line brings color to the @xmath333 line as well as transverse momentum , but it brings no longitudinal momentum and no momentum dependence at its vertex .",
    "this can be interpreted as a color rotation and transverse momentum convolution of the field of nucleon 1 by the gauge field from nucleon 2 followed by a scattering off the left - moving nucleon .",
    "now consider the graphs shown in fig.11 .",
    "we again distort the @xmath122 contour of integration into the upper half plane . in fig.11a",
    "there is also the light - cone denominators from the @xmath334line which must be considered .",
    "the term having a singularity in the upper - half plane is proportional to @xmath335 .",

    "the graph shown in fig.11b has two contributions , one being the @xmath336 term from the @xmath181 propagator and the second being a singularity in the nucleon - gluon scattering process @xmath337 this second term corresponds to a single gluon exchange final state interaction of the left- moving nucleon remnants with nucleon 2 and it cancels with corresponding two - gluon exchange terms in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "the result of the terms in fig.11 is illustrated in fig.12 and can be interpreted as a color rotation , and convolution , of the field from the left - moving nucleon by nucleon 2 followed by a scattering off nucleon 1 .",
    "now we consider the graphs shown in fig.13 .",
    "we shall evaluate these graphs by distorting the @xmath122contour into the",
    "_ lower _ half plane .",
    "since we now distort in a direction opposite to that natural for the factor @xmath331 it is important to check that there is sufficient convergence in the @xmath122 plane so that the exponential factor is not relevant . for example , in graph(a ) one has @xmath122 denominators @xmath338^{-1},[(k+r-\\ell)_++i\\epsilon]^{-1}$ ] and @xmath339^{-1}$ ] multiplying @xmath340 and @xmath341 as well as a possible light - cone denominator from the @xmath342line .",

    "here one obtains a result illustrated in fig.14 along with a rescattering of the remnant of the left - moving nucleon which will cancel as discussed above .",
    "hence , we may view the graphs of fig.13 as a color rotation , and transverse momentum convolution of the field from the left - moving nucleon by nucleon 1 followed by a scattering off nucleon 2 .    finally , there is the graph shown in fig.15 .",

    "( there is also the term @xmath358 coming from the @xmath342line propagator which gives an additional singularity , however this term leads to a small result since the @xmath359 term either cancels between the  @xmath360  and  @xmath361  parts of fig.13 by stw or the @xmath359 eliminates the @xmath362 propagator leaving no singularities whatever in the lower half @xmath118plane . ) when the singularity at @xmath356 is taken one has a resulting @xmath166 which when combined with the results given by the graphs in figs.10 , 12 and 15 gives zero from the stw identities .",
    "the singularity at @xmath363 gives on - shell propagation of the @xmath342line with a rescattering off nucleon 2 after production by nucleon 1 .",
    "thus we recover the result of our calculation in sec.3.2 when that calculation is restricted to the interaction of just two nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "however , one can also describe the scattering in terms of the `` classical '' @xmath11 light - cone gauge fields of the left - moving nucleon and of the 2 right - moving nucleons .",
    "in this case the left - moving nucleon has a classical field color rotated by nucleons 1 and 2 as indicated in figs.12 and 14 .",

    "the gluon production amplitude is then given by the three and four gluon interactions of these incoming `` classical '' fields as described by the graphs in figs.10 , 12 , 14 and 15 .",
    "in appendix b we shall outline the technical argument for this result when an arbitrary number of nucleons in the nucleus are involved in the interaction .",

    "there is not any particular ordering of the @xmath328 positions of the nucleons belonging to  @xmath406  and  @xmath407  that is , some nucleons in  @xmath406  may have larger @xmath328 values than some of the nucleons in  @xmath407  we begin with the graphs of the type shown in fig.17a . for our purposes",
    "the dangerous term is the @xmath408 part of the @xmath342 propagator .",
    "however , once all hookings of the @xmath342line in  @xmath409  are included , at a given order of the coupling and with a given set of nucleons , the net result must be zero from the stw identities .    now turn to graphs of the type shown in fig.17b where one or more lines , in addition to the ( @xmath410line connect  @xmath406  and  @xmath407  a particular example of such a graph is shown in fig.18 , where nucleon1  and nucleon  3  have inelastic reactions while nucleon 2 has an elastic reaction .",
    "the potentially dangerous problem with graphs of this type is that the application of the stw identities does not directly give zero since the @xmath411 line carries color .",
    "indeed , applying the stw identities for the @xmath412 term in the @xmath342 propagator leads to a term like that indicated in fig.19 where the dashed line carries the propagator factors @xmath413 and inserts a momentum @xmath414 on the @xmath415line as well as rotating the color factors of the @xmath415line .",
    "however , this term is small because the scattering with nucleon 2 is the same as the high energy scattering gluon @xmath416 nucleon @xmath417 gluon @xmath418 nucleon and the high energy limit of such a scattering is zero in our approximation of no evolution within nucleon 2 .",
    "thus , the gluon line carrying the large minus component of the momentum @xmath101 the hard gluon line , will never give singularities as one distorts @xmath122momenta into the lower half plane .",
