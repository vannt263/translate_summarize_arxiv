    "one of the main interests in high - mass star formation research today is a thorough characterization of the expected massive accretion disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of this type require high spatial resolution , and disks have been suggested in numerous systems , although not always with the same tracers ( for a recent compilation see @xcite ) .",
    "a major complication is the large degree of chemical diversity in these regions .",
    "this is seen on large scales in terms of the large number of molecular detections ( e.g. , @xcite ) but in particular on the small scale ( of the order @xmath2au and even smaller ) where significant chemical differentiation is found ( e.g. , @xcite ) .   at present",
    ", we are only beginning to decipher the chemical structure of these objects at high spatial resolution , whereas our understanding of the physical properties better allows us to place regions into an evolutionary context ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is not yet clear how our emerging picture of the physical evolution is related to the observed chemical diversity and evolution .",
    "various theory groups work on the chemical evolution during massive star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the results are promising .",
    "however , the observational database to test these models against is still relatively poor .",
    "some single - dish low - spatial - resolution line surveys toward several sources do exist , but they are all conducted with different spatial resolution and covering different frequency bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the chemical structure in massive star - forming regions is far from uniform , and at high resolution one observes spatial variations between many species , prominent examples are orion - kl , w3oh / h@xmath3o or cepheus a ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "single - dish studies targeted larger source samples at low spatial resolution and described the averaged chemical properties of the target regions ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , no consistent chemical investigation of a sample of massive star - forming regions exists at high spatial resolution . to obtain an observational census of the chemical evolution at high spatial resolution and to build up a database for chemical evolutionary models of massive star formation ,",
    "it is important to establish a rather uniformly selected sample of massive star - forming regions in various evolutionary stages .",
    "furthermore , this sample should be observed in the same spectral setup at high spatial resolution .",
    "while the former is necessary for a reliable comparison , the latter is crucial to disentangle the chemical spatial variations in the complex massive star - forming regions . because submm interferometric imaging is a time consuming task",
    ", it is impossible to observe a large sample in a short time .",
    "hence , it is useful to employ synergy effects and observe various sources over a few years in the same spectral lines .",
    "we have undertaken such a chemical survey of massive molecular cores containing high - mass protostars in different evolutionary stages using the submillimeter array ( sma , @xcite ) since 2003 in exactly the same spectral setup .",
    "the four massive star - forming regions span a range of evolutionary stages and luminosities : ( 1 ) the prototypical hot molecular core ( hmc ) orion - kl ( @xcite ) , ( 2 ) an hmc at larger distance g29.96 @xcite , and two regions in a presumably earlier evolutionary phase , namely ( 3 ) the younger but similar luminous high - mass protostellar object ( hmpo ) iras23151 + 5912 @xcite and ( 4 ) the less luminous hmpo iras05358 + 3543 @xcite .",
    "although the latter two regions also have central temperatures @xmath4100k , qualifying them as `` hot '' , their molecular line emission is considerably weaker than from regions which are usually termed hmcs .",
    "therefore , we refer to them from now on as early - hmpos ( see also the evolutionary sequence in @xcite ) .",
    "table [ source_parameters ] lists the main physical parameters of the selected target regions .",
    "the sma offers high spatial resolution ( of the order @xmath5 ) and a large enough instantaneous bandwidth of 4ghz to sample numerous molecular transitions simultaneously ( e.g. , @xmath6sio and its rarer isotopologue @xmath7sio , a large series of ch@xmath0oh lines in the @xmath8 states , ch@xmath0cn , hcooch@xmath0 , so , so@xmath3 , and many more lines in the given setup , see  [ data ] ) .",
    "each of the these observations have been published separately where we provide detailed discussions of the particularities of each source @xcite ) .",
    "these objects span an evolutionary range where the molecular gas and ice coated grains in close proximity to the forming star are subject to increasing degrees of heating .   in this fashion , volatiles will be released from ices near the most evolved ( luminous ) sources altering the surrounding gas - phase chemical equilibrium and molecular emission . in this paper , we synthesize these data and effectively re - observe these systems at identical physical resolution in order to identify coherent trends .",
    "our main goals are to search for ( a ) trends in the chemistry as a function of evolutionary state and ( b ) to explore , in a unbiased manner , the capability of molecular emission to trace coherent velocity structures that have , in the past , been attribute to keplerian disks .",
    "we will demonstrate that the ability of various tracers to probe the innermost region , where a disk should reside , changes as a function of evolution ."
