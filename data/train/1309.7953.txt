    "type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are defined by the presence of broad emission lines , produced by photoionization of the central continuum source @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of the lines depends on the photoionized gas electron density @xmath5 , the ionizing photon density @xmath6 and mean energy , the gas metallicity @xmath7 , column density , and internal velocity dispersion . yet , despite the large effect of these free parameters on the relative line strengths , in particular the effects of @xmath5 and the ionization parameter @xmath8 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the observed properties of the broad lines show a rather small dispersion ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly striking property is the similar relative line strength over the vast range of @xmath3 in luminosity , from the least luminous type 1 agn at @xmath0  erg  s@xmath2  ( e.g.  ngc 4395 , @xcite ) to the most luminous quasars at @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the first photoionization models indicated that the strength of observed emission lines , which are produced by ions that cover a large range of ionization states , can be produced by a single uniform - density cloud model with @xmath9  @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the high ionization lines originate from the cloud surface layer , and the low ionization lines from the inner partially ionized region deep within the cloud @xcite .",
    "followup reverberation mapping ( rm ) studies implied a smaller blr radius and thus higher typical values of @xmath12  @xmath10 and @xmath4 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some line ratios suggested that part of the blr may extend up to @xmath13  @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another remarkable blr property is the uniformity in the values of @xmath6 .",
    "this parameter is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radius of the blr , and @xmath17 is the ionizing luminosity .",
    "reverberation mappings yield @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the near uv luminosity ( @xmath200.5 of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the relation extends over a range of @xmath21 in @xmath19 @xcite , which implies a fixed @xmath6 , independent of @xmath19 .",
    "this relation is well explained by dust sublimation , which sets the outer radius of the blr @xcite , and probably also the inner radius , if the blr is a dust driven failed wind from the accretion disc surface @xcite .",
    "so , although we now have a good understanding of what sets @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath22 , it is not clear why @xmath4 is generally preferred , independent of luminosity .",
    "why are there essentially no agn where the blr is dominated by say @xmath23 gas ?",
    "@xcite suggested this is just a selection effect , where there is a broad chaotic distribution with no preferred values of @xmath24 and @xmath5 , and the emission is dominated by the loc  locally optimally emitting clouds .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the loc clouds must maintain a significant covering factor ( @xmath25 ) of the ionizing continuum source in order to produce the observed line strength .",
    "this constraint is inconsistent with the assumed broad distribution of @xmath24 values , as clouds with the preferred @xmath24 values inevitably constitute only a small fraction of the total distribution , and thus of the total covering factor , while observations indicate that the blr clouds , mostly of @xmath26 , have @xmath27 @xcite . another way to phrase this problem is that if the blr clouds have a power law distribution of @xmath25 versus @xmath24 , then observations require a specific distribution .",
    "@xcite suggested the observed uniformity is `` simple averaging , not a hidden hand of unknown physics , is at work '' .",
    "below we point out the physics which may be at work in setting a universal @xmath4 .",
    "another open question is what confines the blr gas ?",
    "a two phased photoionized medium was ruled out by @xcite , as the hot phase is too cold ( @xmath28  k ) and therefore dense ( @xmath29  @xmath10 ) to remain invisible in emission .",
    "other confining mechanisms , such as magnetic confinement @xcite , or a hotter confining medium heated by other mechanisms such as cosmic rays @xcite , are possible additional options .",
    "alternatively , the blr gas may not need confinement at all , and may be a transient thermal instability in a hot medium ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , or a transient shock in a hot wind @xcite .",
    "another remarkable coincidence is that the ionizing radiation pressure at the blr ( @xmath30 ) , is similar to the gas pressure ( @xmath31 ) , deep enough in the photoionized layer where most of @xmath17 is absorbed .",
    "the ionizing radiation pressure is @xmath32 i.e.  @xmath33 , and @xmath34 the similarity of @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be seen from the relation @xmath35 adopting @xmath4 , @xmath36  ev , and @xmath37  ev , which yields @xmath38 .",
    "this similarity was first pointed out by @xcite , who however derived @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the photoionized blr gas may be confined by radiation pressure , but the required @xmath40 was inconsistent with the ratio derived from photoionization modelling at those pre - rm days .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath16 using rm yielded a significantly smaller value than previously estimated from photoionization modelling , thus a higher @xmath30 and @xmath38 , as noted above .",
    "this relation strongly suggests that radiation pressure confinement ( rpc ) is the mechanism which sets @xmath31 in the blr .",
    "rpc yields @xmath41 in photoionized gas @xmath42  k is a typical value , and in agn the mean spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , i.e.  , is only weakly luminosity dependent .",
    "thus , rpc implies that @xmath24 should be a rather universal quantity in agn , with a value of @xmath43 , as observed .    to summarize , the observed universal blr emission line ratios may result from two effects : ( i ) dust sublimation , which sets @xmath22 , and ( ii ) rpc , which sets @xmath24 .",
    "the two effects then lead to the similar @xmath5 and @xmath24 values observed over a range of @xmath3 in luminosity .",
    "finer effects in the emission properties , like the baldwin relation @xcite and the eigenvector 1 set of correlations @xcite , may be produced by systematic trends in the sed shape and metallicity with luminosity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "radiation pressure was invoked in earlier studies of the blr as a mechanism to produce a radial outflow velocity field ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , the generally similar response time of the red and blue wings of the broad emission lines excluded a pure radial flow ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the similar black hole mass ( @xmath44 ) bulge luminosity relation in nearby galaxies @xcite and in agn , based on the blr @xcite , suggested the blr velocity field is dominated by gravity , which again argues against a radial flow .",
    "thus , on average the radial velocity at the blr is zero , and the gas can be considered as approximately radially static . however , photoionization is inevitably associated with momentum transfer from the incident radiation to the gas , and therefore if the photoionized gas is not accelerated radially , it must be subject to an opposing gradient in @xmath31 , which balances @xmath30 and allows a hydrostatic solution .",
    "in contrast with the uniform density photoionized slab solution ( e.g.  @xcite ) , a solution which includes @xmath30 must have @xmath31 which increases from @xmath45 at the illuminated face of the gas , to @xmath46 deep enough in the gas , where all the ionizing radiation is absorbed .",
    "if @xmath47 , then the gas should also display a large gradient in @xmath5 , and thus a larger gradient in ionization states , compared to a uniform @xmath5 solution .",
    "the effect of radiation pressure on photoionized gas in agn was first explored by @xcite , in a study of the narrow line emission from the circinus galaxy .",
    "this effect was further explored by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in a general study of photoionized dusty gas in the narrow line region ( nlr ) of agn , where they demonstrated that radiation pressure explains the small range in the observed narrow line properties .",
    "a hydrostatic solution of photoionized gas with radiation pressure was presented by @xcite for x - ray warm absorbers in agn . an analytic hydrostatic solution for dusty  regions",
    "was recently presented by @xcite , and a numerical solution was explored by @xcite .    here",
    "we present a hydrostatic solution for gas in the blr . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we first provide a simplified analytic solution for the density profile inside an rpc photoionized slab , and then discuss the numerical methods used . section  [ sec : results ] presents the resulting internal structure of the photoionized gas , and its dependence on the boundary conditions and distance from the ionizing source .",
    "we also present the resulting line strength as a function of distance , ionizing sed and metallicity .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] , and the main conclusions are provided in section  [ sec : conclus ] . in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) ,",
    "we expand the work of @xcite and @xcite , and study the effect of rpc at all radii beyond the sublimation radius .",
    "to explore the net effect of continuum radiation pressure on the radial structure of the blr gas , we analyze the gas element in its rotating frame , and implicitly assume that the force which determines the radial structure is set only by the incident radiation .",
    "this assumption is valid under the following conditions .    1 .",
    "the total gas column density is large enough ( @xmath48  @xmath49 ) for the black hole gravity to dominate the radiation force .",
    "2 .   the gas is on circular orbits maintained by the black hole gravity .",
    "the gas forms an azimuthally symmetric structure , so a shear in the tangential velocity with radius will not affect the gas radial structure .",
    "the effects of deviations from the above assumptions are briefly discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the radiation force on a thin layer of gas at a given @xmath50 is the momentum deposited by radiation per unit area per unit time , which is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the flux weighted mean optical depth of the thin layer , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the position of the illuminated face of the slab of gas . for simplicity",
    "we assume below that @xmath55 , so one can ignore the geometric dilution of the radiative flux @xmath56 as it propagates through the slab . therefore , below we assume @xmath57 is a constant . the relevant luminosity may be somewhat larger than @xmath17 , if non ionizing luminosity is also absorbed .",
    "for example , in fully ionized gas , where electron scattering dominates , the relevant luminosity is the bolometric luminosity , where @xmath58 . in a hydrostatic solution ,",
    "the radiative force is balanced by the gradient in the gas pressure @xmath59 since @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the flux weighted mean absorption coefficient and @xmath62 is the thickness of the layer , we get @xmath63 the solution for @xmath64 is given by integrating the above equation .",
    "deep enough in the slab , where @xmath65 , the integral yields @xmath66 where @xmath45 is the gas pressure at the illuminated face , given by the ambient pressure ( e.g.  a hot dilute gas ) .",
    "the solution is independent of the nature of @xmath61 , which just sets the physical scale required to obtain @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath67 the solution is simply @xmath68 if the ambient pressure is negligible , i.e.  @xmath69 , then at @xmath65 we get @xmath70 , i.e.  the gas pressure deep within the photoionized layer is uniform and is set by the incident radiation pressure , independent of the ambient pressure .",
    "thus , the photoionized gas layer is confined from the illuminated side by the incident radiation pressure , while on the back side it is confined by a thick and static neutral medium .",
    "as noted above , since @xmath71 rpc yields @xmath72 deep enough where most of the ionizing radiation is absorbed .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath73 for photoionized gas at @xmath42  k. the value of @xmath24 increases towards the illuminated surface , and the characteristic value will be @xmath4 , the value where half of the ionizing radiation is absorbed . at the illuminated face",
    ", @xmath24 is set by the boundary condition , @xmath74 .",
    "but , if @xmath69 , then deep enough @xmath24 is set only by @xmath30 , and is independent of @xmath75 .",
    "the emission structure will also be independent of the boundary values .",
    "for example , close to the surface layer , where say only 1 per cent of @xmath57 is absorbed , we necessarily get @xmath76 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 or @xmath78 once @xmath79 is calculated self consistently ( see below ) .",
    "this implies that a fixed fraction of about @xmath201 per cent of the ionizing continuum is reprocessed into line emission in @xmath78 gas .",
    "similarly @xmath200.1 per cent will be emitted by @xmath80 gas , @xmath2010 per cent by @xmath81 gas , and @xmath2050 per cent by @xmath82 gas .",
    "thus , one does not need to invoke a population of ` clouds ' with a range of @xmath24 , but rather a single ionized layer produces lines from gas with a large range of @xmath24 , with well determined relative strengths , set by the rpc solution .",
    "specific solutions for @xmath83 based on photoionization calculations are presented below .",
    "a simple analytic solution can be obtained for a hot scattering - dominated gas , where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the electron scattering cross section .",
    "this condition applies for a low @xmath5 gas , where @xmath86 and the gas is fully ionized .",
    "the gas will be at the compton temperature @xmath87 , and thus isothermal , which simplifies the problem .",
    "we make a further simplification that @xmath88 , so @xmath89 .",
    "the derived equation is then @xmath90 which gives @xmath91 where @xmath92 thus , there is an exponential rise in @xmath5 on a length scale of @xmath93 ( a derivation of @xmath94 , without neglecting the geometrical dilution of @xmath57 , is presented in appendix  [ sec : large_d ] ) . within a few",
    "@xmath93 the value of @xmath5 will be high enough to inevitably lead to @xmath95 , at which point the gas becomes cooler and only partially ionized , leading to a sharp increase in the absorption opacity .",
    "both effects , @xmath96 and @xmath97 will produce a sharp rise in @xmath98 .",
    ", where @xmath99 , the gas @xmath100 is a function of @xmath79 , and there is no analytic solution for @xmath83 .",
    "this is in contrast with paper i , where the opacity down to @xmath101 is dominated by dust , which has a fixed @xmath100 . ]",
    "the uniform pressure region , i.e.  @xmath65 , is therefore reached within a few @xmath93 at most , even for an illuminated face with a very low density .    to estimate the value of @xmath93 we need the values of @xmath57 and @xmath87 at the blr .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is derived from the observed relation @xmath102 where @xmath103  erg  s@xmath2  and @xmath19 is the bolometric luminosity ( @xcite ; assuming @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the luminosity at 1350   ) .",
    "this implies @xmath106 photoionization calculations yield @xmath107  k ( see below ) , which gives @xmath108  cm , independent of the agn luminosity .",
    "this size becomes larger than @xmath16 for @xmath109  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "in such low luminosity agn , rpc can still confine the blr gas if @xmath95 at the illuminated face , as the gas is not fully ionized , leading to @xmath110 and @xmath111  k , which reduces @xmath93 by a few orders of magnitude , allowing rpc to work in the lowest luminosity agn .",
    "since @xmath112 at the blr , @xmath70 implies @xmath113 or @xmath114  @xmath10  in the deeper part of the photoionized gas .",
    "the ionizing spectral slope affects the value of @xmath115 by a factor of @xmath116 and thus will not have a significant effect on the above estimates .",
    "the metallicity affects the ionization structure , and thus the thickness of the ionized layer .",
    "both effects are explored below in the numerical calculation .",
    "we use the photoionization code cloudy 10.00 @xcite to calculate the structure and line emission of rpc slabs .",
    "the code is executed with the ` constant pressure ' command , which enforces the code to find solutions that satisfy eq .",
    "[ eq : dp_dr ] .",
    "we do not include the contribution of trapped line emission pressure ( ) to the gas pressure ( see below ) .",
    "the calculation is stopped when the ionized to neutral h fraction drops to 1 per cent .",
    "we denote the stopping radius at the back of the slab as @xmath117 , and the slab thickness as @xmath118 .",
    "for some of the models the condition @xmath119 does not apply , and we therefore always include the geometrical dilution @xmath120 term of the flux within the slab .",
    "the total h density ( neutral and ionized ) at the slab illuminated face  is varied in the range @xmath121 .",
    "we explore models in the range @xmath122 . at @xmath123",
    ", the condition @xmath124 applies in the blr even for the minimal density explored , and the slab structure is mostly a function of @xmath57 , and thus independent of @xmath19 .",
    "the largest  explored is just outside the dust sublimation radius , @xmath125 @xcite , i.e.  twice @xmath16 , where dust suppression of line emission sets the outer boundary of the blr .",
    "the smallest  explored is @xmath126 , which is close to the size of the optically emitting region in the accretion disc .",
    "the specific model explored is with @xmath127 , where the above range corresponds to @xmath128 .",
    "the values of metallicity explored are @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "three types of sed are adopted , which differ in the ionizing sed slope  ( @xmath131 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the sed is identical between 1  @xmath132 m and 1  ryd . in this range ,",
    "the sed is evaluated by using @xmath133 with @xmath134 , @xmath135  ev and @xmath136  ev .",
    "a cut - off is assumed for @xmath137  @xmath132 m .",

    "due to some convergence problems in cloudy , the contribution of  to the total @xmath145 balance is included only in some of the models .",
    "however , we verified that excluding  does not change qualitatively the results of our study , as further described in appendix  [ sec : comp_pline ] .",
    "the rpc slab structure typically displays a hot low density surface layer at @xmath87 , and a @xmath42  k photoionized inner layer , followed by a neutral and colder layer .",
    "it must therefore pass through an intermediate photoionized layer at @xmath146  k , a layer notorious for its thermal instability ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the instability allows two separate stable solution with the same thermal pressure , i.e.  @xmath147 , above and below the unstable part . a similar thermal instability exists in collisionally heated gas ( e.g.  @xcite , ch .",
    "30 ) , where there is a broad range ( factor of @xmath148 ) in @xmath79 of unstable solutions , and thus widely separated combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath79 of stable solution at a given pressure . in contrast , the ionizing sed of agn leads to a more restricted ranges in @xmath79 of unstable solution , as derived in calculation of x - ray warm absorber models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most complete warm absorber models , which include rpc , are presented by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "their model ( titan ) allows to derive the two stable solutions at a given pressure .",
    "in contrast , the slab solving scheme implemented by cloudy leads to a single solution only .",
    "however , at @xmath149  k , which is relevant for the blr , there is only a single stable solution , set by the total pressure in that layer .",
    "cloudy may not be the best tool at the moment to study the structure of the intermediate @xmath146  k layer .",
    "however , once the cumulative pressure builds up leading to the thermally stable layer at @xmath150  k , the solution should not depend on the exact structure at @xmath151  k , a region which is relevant for x - ray warm absorbers .",

    "this discrepancy is likely related to the famous and persistent ` /  problem ' @xcite , which may result from an underestimate of the  emission in photoionization calculations , potentially due to a radiative transfer effect ( e.g.  @xcite , section  8.4 there for a possibly related effect in the underestimate of the optical  emission ) .",
    "as shown in earlier studies @xcite and verified by observations @xcite , the blr is bounded from the outside by dusty photoionized gas , as dust embedded in the line emitting gas strongly suppresses the line emission once @xmath289 .",
    "dust sublimation explains both the scaling and absolute value of the observed @xmath241  pc relation .",
    "dust also provides a natural inner boundary for the blr , if the blr gas originates from a failed dusty wind , and the wind exists down to the sublimation radius within the accretion disc atmosphere , which is smaller by a factor of few of the dust sublimation radius above the disc @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms imply that the blr gas is subject to a characteristic @xmath290  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath291  erg  @xmath10 , or an ionizing photon density @xmath292  @xmath10 .    in this study",
    "we point out that @xmath30 inevitably leads to a pressure gradient within the photoionized gas . the thermal pressure within the photoionized gas therefore builds up to @xmath70 , or @xmath293 , which implies @xmath294 .",
    "thus , rpc leads to a fixed ratio of @xmath232 for the typical agn sed , as found by observation .",
    "these two mechanisms , dust which sets @xmath6 , and rpc which sets @xmath24 , lead to a unique solution for the blr structure and line emission , independent of @xmath19 .",
    "these mechanisms provide a natural explanation for the similar blr emission observed over a range of @xmath3 in agn luminosity .",
    "an rpc slab of gas is characterized by a density which increases inwards , reaching  once all the ionizing @xmath57 is absorbed ( which can include radiation longwards of 912   , depending on the ionization and excitation states ) .",
    "this generally implies @xmath295 in rpc gas near a point source .",
    "the density structure of the photoionized layer , as measured from the neutral inner part , has a nearly universal shape .",
    "the boundary gas pressure @xmath45 at the surface of the ionized gas has no effect on the inner structure , as long as @xmath69 .",
    "the structure is characterized by a surface layer at @xmath296  k for the typical agn sed , which exists in regions where @xmath297 ( figs  [ fig : struct_nt_15 ] and [ fig : struct_nt_17 ] ) .",
    "this hot surface layer exists at @xmath298 , where @xmath299 , which implies @xmath86 , required for a fully ionized gas .",
    "once @xmath300 inside the cloud , one gets @xmath95 , bound electrons become abundant , the absorption opacity rises , leading to a warm , @xmath146  k , and possibly thermally unstable layer .",
    "this layer may break up into two phases according to the stable regions in the @xmath31 versus @xmath79 photoionization solutions , which we do not explore in this study .",
    "however , once @xmath301 , one gets @xmath42  k , the bulk of the ionizing luminosity is absorbed , and the prominent optical and uv blr lines are produced .    the ionization structure and the line emission from rpc gas is equivalent to a superposition of optically thin uniform density slabs , with @xmath24 decreasing from 100 ( or higher ) to 1 , and an additional ionization bounded slab with @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the main difference between the standard blr solution of a uniform density slab , and the rpc solution , is the addition of higher ionization ` surface ' layers .",
    "these layers are responsible for excess  @xmath2601034 and  @xmath260774 emission , which is otherwise interpreted as additional blr cloud components with @xmath230 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "rpc predicts there should also be an additional blr component of even higher ionization lines , produced by the @xmath78 layer .",
    "this lower density layer may produce some forbidden lines from highly ionized ions , however the emission may be hard to detect , as this layer absorbs only @xmath302 per cent of the ionizing radiation , and the predicted line luminosities are correspondingly weak .",
    "in addition , the main coolants occur in the extreme uv , such as the various fe lines :  @xmath260133 ,  @xmath260111 and  @xmath260121 , and are therefore essentially unobservable .",
    "the associated forbidden optical and nuv lines from these ions are expected to produce very weak broad lines , and are thus very difficult to detect .",
    "is the hydrostatic solution maintained by radiation pressure stable ?",
    "earlier studies of radiation pressure effects on photoionized gas @xcite found that radiatively driven photoionized gas may be susceptible to various instabilities .",
    "these studies were motivated by early suggestions to explain the broad line profiles as a radiatively driven outflow .",
    "however , we now know that the blr dynamics is largely dominated by the gravity of the black hole , which indicates it must be composed of a large column gas , where gravity inevitably dominates radiation pressure .",
    "we also know that the blr gas is not composed of small clouds @xcite , and is most likely a smooth flow , possibly formed by a failed disc wind @xcite .",
    "thus , the earlier studies are not relevant for the blr we know today .",
    "we do not attempt to explore the stability of the hydrostatic solution .",
    "we can only comment that the photoionized layer must be supported by a large column ( @xmath303  @xmath49 ) of static gas on the back side , to avoid forming a wind , and we suspect this support can allow a stable solution .      is the steady state solution a valid assumption ?",
    "we know the ionizing continuum in agn varies with time .",
    "how long will it take for the rpc solution to adapt to a new @xmath19 ?",
    "even if @xmath19 is a constant , the blr gas likely rises from the accretion disc , enters the ionizing radiation field , and needs to reach a steady state structure .",
    "the physical thickness of the ` proper ' blr layer , i.e.  where @xmath304  @xmath10 , is @xmath305  cm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_nt_17 ] ) .",
    "if the rising gas is compressed by the radiation pressure , the minimal radial acceleration is @xmath306  cm  s@xmath307 , which gives a maximal time of @xmath308  s. however , since the flux weighted mean absorption opacity in blr gas is likely @xmath309 , the compression timescale can be a few days , rather than a few months .",
    "if the gas rising from the accretion disc has internal pressure larger than implied by rpc , it will expand at the sound speed of @xmath310  cm  s@xmath2 and will fill in the required width in @xmath311  s. the dynamical timescale ( ) at the blr is @xmath312 the light crossing time ( assuming a keplerian velocity of @xmath313 ) , and thus typically at least few years .",
    "a similar timescale is obtained if the vertical motion from the disc to the blr is a fraction of the keplerian velocity , and the gas rises above the disc to a fraction of the radius .",
    "we therefore expect that the travel time of the gas from the disc surface to the height of the blr , is comparable to the time it will take the gas to expand and relax to the steady state rpc solution .    the above considerations also apply for luminosity variability .",
    "when the luminosity increases , the blr density will adapt to the higher density rpc solution on a short timescale , likely a few days .",
    "however , when the luminosity decreases , the relaxation to the lower density solution occurs only at the sound crossing time , i.e.  @xmath21  s. one may therefore expect some hysteresis effect in the response of the line emission to continuum variations .",
    "if the total h column of the gas ( @xmath315 ) is @xmath316  @xmath49 , then our assumption that gravity dominates the radiative force may not hold . specifically , the ratio of the radiation force to gravity for an optically thick cloud is @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the luminosity in eddington units , and @xmath319  @xmath49 . if @xmath320 , e.g.  for gas with @xmath321 in moderately high , @xmath322 , agn , the gas will be radially accelerated and form an outflow .",
    "the outflowing gas may still be confined by rpc , due to the differential acceleration of different layers within the gas cloud , relative to the bulk acceleration of the cloud ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , since the blr is generally not an outflowing wind , gas clouds with @xmath320 do not form the bulk of the blr emitting gas .",
    "if @xmath323 , then the hydrostatic solution derived above is valid .",
    "the gas slab structure is presented in figure  [ fig : struct_all ] up to a column of @xmath324  @xmath49 , but the solution extends to @xmath325 , where the neutral h fraction equals 1 per cent ( sec .  [ sec : th_model ] ) .",
    "the calculations are valid for agn with @xmath326 , if @xmath327 .",
    "a hydrostatic solution for a @xmath328 cloud remains valid for agn with @xmath329 .",
    "the effect of reducing @xmath315 to @xmath330  @xmath49  on the predicted line emission is small .",
    "we recalculate the line emission from an rpc slab located at @xmath203 , and now stop the calculation when @xmath328 , rather than at @xmath325 . the emission of  decreases by @xmath331 per cent , and that of ]  @xmath2601750 and  @xmath2601304 increases by @xmath332 and @xmath333 per cent , respectively .",
    "the emission of all other lines , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] , differs by less than 1 per cent .",
    "note that an rpc slab achieves its full ionization stratification at @xmath334  @xmath49  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_all ] ) , and thus blr clouds with @xmath315 of a few @xmath330  @xmath49  @xcite are likely to contain emitting ions of all ionization states .    what happens at the intermediate case when @xmath335 ? in this case , the gas can still maintain a circular orbit , but the radial acceleration will be reduced significantly by the radiation force , which opposes a significant fraction of the black hole gravity @xcite . a hydrostatic solution is still valid in the rotating frame .",
    "however , the gas pressure gradient now balances only the differential radiative acceleration between the bulk acceleration of the cloud and the local radiative acceleration .",
    "for example , if @xmath336 , then the gas pressure will build up to a maximal value of @xmath337 of the value for the @xmath323 solution , which corresponds to @xmath230 , rather than @xmath4 .",
    "however , one needs fine tuning of @xmath338 to be just below unity to have a significant effect , and such clouds will likely be rare .      above ( section  [ sec : theory ] )",
    "we considered the geometrical dilution of the incident flux in a geometrically thick slab , i.e.  a slab where @xmath339 is comparable to .",
    "another significant effect is a shear due to the gradient in the keplerian velocity with @xmath50 .",
    "the difference in keplerian velocity across the slab thickness is @xmath340 where @xmath341 is the gravitational constant and @xmath342 . for a slab to remain intact , the following condition should hold @xmath343 which is satisfied for @xmath344 where @xmath345  cm  s@xmath2 , and @xmath346 corresponds to @xmath347  k. for a cloud at @xmath16 ( fig .",

    "the shear occurs on a timescale of @xmath352 if the blr is composed of individual small clouds , than the clouds will likely be sheared on a dynamical timescale of a few .",
    "the likely steady state structure is a roughly an azimuthally symmetric gas distribution , as assumed in this study .",
    "the major trends in the emission line properties of agn are the drop in ew of most lines with increasing @xmath19 ( @xcite ; and citations thereafter ) , and the so - called eigenvector 1 ( ev1 ) set of correlation @xcite .",
    "the baldwin relation is commonly explained by a softening of the mean sed with increasing @xmath19 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while the ev1 is commonly interpreted as a metallicity effect , where objects with high optical / , weak [ ] /  and various other associated uv properties , such as the relative strength of the  @xmath2601240 line @xcite have a high @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "rpc allows a more significant test of these suggestions , as  and @xmath24 are no longer free parameters .",
    "indeed , the rpc cloudy model calculations presented above indicate that lines from ions of increasing ionization energy display a steeper dependence of the line ew on , and since  and @xmath19 are likely related , it explains the steeper luminosity dependence of higher ionization lines @xcite .",
    "extreme ev1 objects , such as narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , generally have weaker  @xmath2601549 , stronger low ionization lines , such as  @xmath2601304 , stronger n lines , such as ]  @xmath2601750 , and stronger  @xmath2601397 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are indeed expected at a higher @xmath7 , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] .    a very clear exception to the baldwin relation is the  @xmath2601240 line , where the ew is essentially independent of @xmath19 , despite its high ionization energy @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ew ] demonstrates that this can be explained by a relation of @xmath19 and @xmath7 , where the steeper  with increasing @xmath19 is compensated by a rising @xmath7 with @xmath19 .",
    "the later relation is expected in a sample of luminous agn ( the @xmath353 quasars used for measuring  @xmath2601240 ) , which are inevitably close to their eddington limit .",
    "thus , high @xmath19 quasars are associated with a large black hole mass , which is associated with a massive host galaxy , which have a higher @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the higher than linear increase of the n abundance with @xmath19 , increases the ew of various n lines , but for  @xmath2601240 this rise is almost exactly cancelled by the softer , which decreases the ew of all other high ionization lines .",
    "this leads to an absence of a baldwin relation for the  @xmath2601240 line , as was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , in these earlier studies @xmath154 and @xmath24 were considered as free parameters , while rpc indicates  and @xmath7 are the only free parameters , and their combined effect nearly eliminates the baldwin effect for the  @xmath2601240 line .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] shows that the line emissivity drops sharply at @xmath354 .",
    "the width of the transition region from dustless to dusty gas is expected to be broader than assumed here .",
    "the sublimation temperature depends on the grain composition , and the ambient pressure .",
    "in addition , the grain temperature depends on the grain size . the largest graphite grains ( @xmath355  @xmath132 m ) sublimate at @xmath356  pc ( assuming negligible ambient pressure ) .",
    "the smallest graphite grains ( @xmath357  @xmath132 m ) sublimate at @xmath358 , while the smallest silicate grains sublimate at @xmath359 ( @xcite , fig .  8 there ) .",
    "thus , the dust sublimation region is actually extended , as the smallest silicate grains start to sublimate already at @xmath360  pc , and complete sublimation occurs at @xmath361  pc .",
    "these values also depend on the ambient pressure , where a higher pressure allows the grains to survive at a higher temperature . the grain size distribution , and the implied dust opacity therefore change with distance , and probably also with depth within the photoionized layer .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume just a single @xmath245 , but the drop in line emission beyond @xmath245 is expected to be more gradual .",
    "why does rpc predict a radial stratification in the line emission in the blr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] ) , while rpc also predicts that @xmath4 at all @xmath117 ?",
    "the reason is most likely a differential effect in the collisional suppression of lines of different ionization levels .",
    "the lower ionization lines come from @xmath362 , as they are collisionally suppressed at @xmath363 . in an rpc slab ,",
    "a particular line emission ( e.g.  ) originates in a layer with a local @xmath24 which is optimal in producing the emitting ion ( c@xmath214 ) . for slabs with smaller  ( i.e.  larger @xmath364 )",
    ", this local @xmath24 is reached in layers with higher @xmath154 .",
    "the lower ionization line emission ( e.g.  ) is produced in layers with a relatively low @xmath24 ( @xmath365 ) , which corresponds to very high @xmath154 for small  ( @xmath366  @xmath10  for @xmath205 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_all ] , upper - left panel ) .",
    "but at these high @xmath154 , the line becomes thermalized and produces little line emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the higher ionization lines ( e.g.  ) are produced at a higher @xmath24 layer ( @xmath332 ) , i.e.  at lower @xmath154 , which has a weaker effect in collisional suppression of the line emission .",
    "another related effect is the depth and the column of the layer from which the various lines originate .",
    "higher ionization lines come from a layer closer to the surface , with a lower column ( since the flux of ionizing photons which can produce higher ionization ions is smaller ) .",
    "the lower column implies a smaller line optical depth , a higher line escape probability , and thus weaker collisional de - excitation .",
    "this effect is also seen in cloudy uniform density slab models , where increasing @xmath154 at a fixed @xmath24 leads to a larger suppression of the lower ionization lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] shows that if there is a uniform distribution of @xmath257 , then the mean emission radius should drop with increasing line ionization .",
    "thus , rm should show the largest delays for the  and  lines , followed by , , , and + . for",
    "the expected delay is about 1/3 of the low ionization lines delay , for  and  about 1/5 , for  about 1/10 , and for  it is @xmath367 . in the best",
    "studied rm object , ngc  5548 , the measured trend of delays with ionization is consistent with the above .",
    "the longest delays are of 40 and 22 days for  and , 20 and 10 days for  and , and 10 , 2 and 2 days for ,  and  ( compilation in table 13.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar effect is observed in ground based rm , where the  @xmath368 delay is a factor of @xmath369 shorter than the  delay ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity provides further support for the validity of rpc for the blr , and further suggests that @xmath257 is roughly a constant in the blr .",
    "how much does the blr extend inwards ? according to @xcite the blr should terminate when the accretion disc atmosphere is too hot to support dust , which is expected to occur at a radius a factor of few smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "thus , rm of the highest ionization lines , in particular the  @xmath260774 line , can be used to probe the inner boundary of the blr .",
    "another way to test the radial distribution of the emission of various lines is through their relative widths .",
    "@xcite indeed found that the  @xmath370 line is significantly broader than other lines .",
    "based on a handful of objects in table 2 there , we get a mean fwhm of 13,600  km  s@xmath2  for versus 6300  km  s@xmath2  for  and 5200  km  s@xmath2  for , which for keplerian motions suggest distance ratios of 7 for /  and 1.5 for / , not far from the expected ratio based on figure  [ fig : ew ] .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in the higher quality cos spectra of lower @xmath371 agn presented by @xcite . based on their composite spectrum ( fig .",
    "6 there ) , the estimated mean fwhm of  @xmath370 is also 13,600  km  s@xmath2  ( although the line is blended with nearby  and  lines ; their contribution is expected to be negligible ) , versus a mean fwhm of 7,200  km  s@xmath2  for  and 5,400  km  s@xmath2  for . inspection of fig .",
    "3 in @xcite suggests that  is typically broader than  ( see also @xcite ) , which is consistent with its smaller emitting radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] ) .",
    "the  line is often broader than , as expected from rpc ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ew ] ) , and consistent with the smaller size deduced from rm for the handful of objects with rm for the  line .",
    "however , in objects where the  fwhm@xmath372  km  s@xmath2 , one generally gets that the  line is broader than  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a specific striking case is arp  102b , where the balmer lines and the  line are extremely broad and double peaked , while  has a prominent single and relatively narrow peak @xcite .",
    "the low and high ionization lines in such objects may come from different regions @xcite .",
    "such an effect may occur if the failed disc wind , which feeds the blr , changes systematically with the global disc properties .",
    "in contrast , in 3c390.3 ,  shows a double peaked structure , similar to the one seen in  @xcite .",
    "the level of discrepancy between the high and low ionization line profiles is clearly an important and open question , which needs to be further explored .",
    "agn display similar emission line properties over a vast range of @xmath3 in luminosity . here",
    "we point out that the ionizing @xmath30 sets @xmath31 inside a photoionized slab of gas .",
    "this rpc effect leads to a similar @xmath24 distribution within any photoionized static gas , regardless of its distance from the agn , or the agn luminosity .",
    "since @xmath16 is set by dust sublimation , either inside or above the accretion disc , which sets the @xmath373 relation , the blr is characterized by a universal @xmath374  erg  @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 of an illuminated slab rises from the ambient pressure at the illuminated face of the slab , to @xmath70 deep inside the slab where all the radiation is absorbed , which implies @xmath375  @xmath10  and @xmath4 near the h ionization front .",
    "this leads to a universality of line ratios , as observed in agn .",
    "an rpc slab can be considered as a superposition of optically thin slabs with @xmath24 dropping from @xmath376 near the surface , to @xmath377 deep inside , where the last slab can be optically thick .",
    "an rpc slab thus produces lines from a larger range of ionization states , compared to a uniform density slab .",
    "the emitted spectrum includes lines from a large range of ionization states , and can reproduce the observed strength of most lines for @xmath27 ( as suggested in earlier studies ) , including the  line .",
    "there is no need to invoke a distribution of clouds with a range of @xmath24 values ( which is in fact not possible for radially static clouds ) , as a specific range of @xmath24 is present in a single rpc slab .",
    "rpc predicts a specific radial distribution of line emission , where the lower ionization lines peak near @xmath245 , and the average emission radius moves inwards with increasing ionization state , as found in rm , and indicated by the larger fwhm of the higher ionization lines , such as ,  and .",
    "the free parameters which affect the rpc solution at a given @xmath50 are @xmath271 and @xmath7 .",
    "the derived trends of the line strength with @xmath271 and @xmath7 are similar to those derived in uniform density models , where the recombination lines provide a good measure of @xmath271 , while the  line and the weaker metal lines are sensitive to @xmath7 .",
    "however , rpc provides a unique solution for the integrated line emission , for a given @xmath257 .",
    "this solution can be used to test the validity of possible mechanisms that may set @xmath257 .",
    "an apparent inconsistency with rpc appears in objects with very broad balmer lines , which generally show narrower  lines .",

    "<S> active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are characterized by similar broad emission lines properties at all luminosities ( @xmath0@xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 ) . what produces this similarity over a vast range of @xmath3 in luminosity ? </S>",
    "<S> photoionization is inevitably associated with momentum transfer to the photoionized gas . </S>",
    "<S> yet , most of the photoionized gas in the broad line region ( blr ) follows keplerian orbits , which suggests that the blr originates from gas with a large enough column for gravity to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> the photoionized surface layer of the gas must develop a pressure gradient due to the incident radiation force . </S>",
    "<S> we present solutions for the structure of such a hydrostatic photoionized gas layer in the blr . </S>",
    "<S> the gas is stratified , with a low - density highly - ionized surface layer , a density rise inwards , and a uniform - density cooler inner region , where the gas pressure reaches the incident radiation pressure . </S>",
    "<S> this radiation pressure confinement ( rpc ) of the photoionized layer leads to a universal ionization parameter @xmath4 in the inner photoionized layer , independent of luminosity and distance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , rpc appears to explain the universality of the blr properties in agn . </S>",
    "<S> we present predictions for the blr emission per unit covering factor , as a function of distance from the ionizing source , for a range of ionizing continuum slopes and gas metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted mean strength of most lines ( excluding ) , and their different average - emission radii , are consistent with the available observations .    </S>",
