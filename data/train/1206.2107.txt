    "the entropy of measurements of an experiment with outcomes with certain probabilities .",
    "the one we study here is related to mathematical measurements .",
    "what we mean will be understood along the paper , however , basically this means that the entropy we study here has a lot of mathematical sense as it is related to the geometry of space - time .    in the present paper",
    "we depart from geometrical measurements in three dimensional quantum gravity associated to spin network observables , in the way it was introduced in @xcite and which were later used to develop an idea for dealing with entropy in the spin foam model description of quantum gravity in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    the corresponding measurements",
    ", which meaning will be understood later on , of spin network graphs have certain probabilities assigned .",
    "these probabilities are computed by a specific partition function which we will recall . once these probabilities are obtained the shannon entropy of each spin network",
    "can be computed in general .",
    "however , to obtain specific values of the shannon entropy of each spin network graph one would need a computing program . as our task is only in a theoretical way we just present how the shannon entropy of each spin network is bounded .",
    "the interesting thing is that it is bounded by some very well known values used in conformal field theory ; the logarithm of the dimension of the space of conformal blocks .",
    "we divide this paper as follows : in section 2 we recall the notion of observables and their assigned probabilities in three dimensional quantum gravity with cosmological constant known mathematically as the turaev - viro model .",
    "we also explain how these probabilities are related to mathematical meausurements .    in section 3",
    "we present the shannon entropy of the observables .",
    "first we give the already known definition of the shannon entropy and then we present some examples for calculating it .",
    "we show how in very simple examples the shannon entropy is bounded by the logarithm of the dimension of the space of conformal blocks .",
    "this section is what is new in our approach of defining entropy in spin foam models .    in section 4",
    "we describe a way to generalise what we present in section 3 .",
    "generally speaking the partition fucntion of spin foam models is as follows :    a spin foam partition function is based on a triangulation @xmath0 of the space - time @xmath1 manifold or on the dual two - complex @xmath2 of the triangulation and is given by    @xmath3    where the sum is carried over a set of states @xmath4 given by the colouring of faces by irreducible representations of @xmath5 and of intertwiners associated to the edges , that is , coloured by a colour which belong to the infinite set @xmath6 .",
    "the sum is over the product of amplitudes associated to the faces and to the vertices of the two - complex .",
    "@xmath7 is an amplitude associated to the faces of the two - complex given by the dimension of the representation which colours the corresponding face and @xmath8 is a function which depends on the colours of the faces adjacent to the vertex and on the intertwiners of the edges adjacent to the vertex .",
    "the function depends on the particular spin foam model we are considering . between the most important spin foam models which have been introduced are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    a special case of spin foam models of three dimensional quantum gravity with cosmological constant is the turaev - viro model @xcite .",
    "the definition of the model is as follows .",
    "given a triangulated three dimensional space - time manifold @xmath1 and a finite set of indices @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , we define a state as a function from the set of edges @xmath11 .",
    "a state is called admissible if at each face of the triangulation , the labels @xmath12 of the corresponding edges satisfy the following identities :    @xmath13    the spin foam partition function is given by    @xmath14    where we have a product of the amplitudes @xmath15 associated to the edges and of the amplitudes associated to the tetrahedra @xmath16 .",
    "the sum is carried over the set of all admissible states @xmath4 . the amplitude associated to the edges",
    "is given by    @xmath17    and the amplitude associated to the tetrahedra is given by the quantum @xmath18 symbol of the six labels of its edges .",
    "@xmath19 is the number of vertices of the triangulation and @xmath20 .",
    "the state sum ( 3 ) is the partition function of quantum gravity in three dimensions with a cosmological constant .",
    "mathematically it gives an invariant of the three dimensional manifold @xmath1 .",
    "let us now describe the set of observables we are going to deal with , since we will define their entropy .    in @xcite",
    ", observables for the turaev - viro spin foam model were introduced .",
    "the idea was constructed in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we recall it here in a more formal way than previous references .",
    "let @xmath1 be the triangulated three dimensional manifold .",
    "an observable is a subset of @xmath21 edges of the triangulation @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be labels at the @xmath21 edges of @xmath24    let an observable @xmath24 with @xmath21 edges labelled @xmath23 .",
    "consider the partition function    @xmath25    this is similar to the state sum formula ( 3 ) , with the only difference that now we are not summing over the spins @xmath23 which label the graph observable @xmath24 .",
    "the probability of the observable @xmath24 with edges labelled @xmath26 , is given by    @xmath27    this probability is of course well defined when @xmath28 .",
    "let us clarify something about the probabilities of the observables .",
    "first of all , the numbers are real and strictly positive .",
    "this is because we only have admissible colourings .",
    "it is also true that , @xmath29 , for all the different values of @xmath30 .",
    "the probabilities we are defining here are the ones we are referring to as measurements .",
    "the question is , what is measured ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the observable graph and therefore is understood with examples .",
    "some examples of observables and of these probabilities were considered and formally computed in @xcite .",
    "* example 1 : * if the observable @xmath24 consists of a single edge labelled @xmath31 , it was formally shown in @xcite that    , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    @xmath32    for the edge observable graph we observe that we have a set of probabilities where @xmath31 goes from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "these set of probabilities is what is measured .",
    "but , what is the interpretation of these measures ?",
    "the interpretation is geometrical in nature and it is described in @xcite . when @xmath35 , although the limit is degenerate , the probability is interpreted to be related to the area of a 2-sphere of radius @xmath36 .",
    "the 2-sphere is embbeded in @xmath37 of radius @xmath38 .",
    "we can therefore say that the interpretation of the measurements are geometrical .",
    "the area of a 2-sphere of radius @xmath36 in @xmath37 of radius @xmath38 in terms of the probabilities is given by    @xmath39    the different areas are proportional to the probabilities .    what is measured is different areas of two spheres of radii which go from @xmath40 when @xmath41 to @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "* example 2 : * if the observable @xmath24 consists of a triangle whose edges are labelled @xmath44 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 , it was formally shown in @xcite that    , @xmath31 , @xmath45,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the dimension of the space of intertwiners , i.e. equal to 1 if the spins are admissible and 0 otherwise .",
    "but since we are considering admissible colourings from the definition we always have that the probabilities are never zero .",
    "the interpretation of what is measured here for the triangle observable is as follows : given a triangle observable whose edges are labelled @xmath44 , @xmath31 , @xmath45 , the probability that the distances between its vertices are @xmath48 , @xmath36 , @xmath49 is given by formula @xmath50 .    in the next section",
    "we will define and study the shannon entropy of these examples and will consider some generalisations in section 4 .",
    "in this section we define and study the shannon entropy of the probabilities of the observable spin network graphs .",
    "we will show some bounded properties of the previous examples of last section . given the probabilities of the observables we defined in the previous section",
    "we now consider shannon s entropy of these data .",
    "shannon entropy was introduced by claude shannon @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a classic textbook on the subject and @xcite for a recent approach on the change in entropy associated with a measure - preserving function .",
    "let a set of possible events have probabilities @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 the shannon entropy is the function on @xmath55 given by    @xmath56    note that naturally the shannon entropy is in fact a sequence of functions on finite sets of probabilities of events .",
    "the shannon entropy is a unique function with certain properties which can be recalled in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the one we consider here is that shannon s entropy is maximal when the set of all probabilities @xmath55 are equal .",
    "there is the inequality    @xmath57      if we consider the observable @xmath24 consisting of a single edge labelled @xmath31 , we have from our previous section the set of probabilities corresponding to each spin , that is , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . the shannon entropy of this example can be computed from formula @xmath60 and applying formula @xmath61 it is obviously bounded by    .",
    "the abscissa axis represents different values of @xmath62.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    @xmath63    in figure 1 we can see a discrete plot of the shannon entropy function of the edge observable for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "the blue one represents the shannon entropy function and it is compared against the growing of @xmath64 which is drawn in purple .",
    "let us mention something about the shannon entropy of the one edge observable .",
    "formula @xmath65 is an inequality which means that the major contribution to the entropy of the one edge observable is given by @xmath64 which is when all probabilities are equal .",
    "however , not all probabilities are equal . according to previous section ,",
    "the one edge observable probabilities are interpreted as measuring the area of 2-spheres of different radii in @xmath37 which radius is @xmath38 .",
    "it can be observed from formula @xmath66 that the most probable outcomes of geometrical measurements of the one edge observable are given by 2-spheres of larger area . for large @xmath62",
    "this happens when @xmath31 is between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    once again ; the entropy is dominated by the most probable outcomes , which in this case is given by larger areas of 2-spheres in @xmath37 .",
    "this is what we can say about this geometrical measurements .",
    "if we consider the observable @xmath24 consisting of the triangle labelled @xmath44 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 , we have from equation @xmath50 a set of probabilities    @xmath69    which runs over all different admissible colourings of a triangle .",
    "the shannon entropy function is computed from formula @xmath60 , and the following is true :    the shannon entropy of the triangle observable with the set of probabilities as in ( 13 ) is bounded by its maximal possible value    @xmath70    which means that the number of non - zero probabilities is @xmath71 .",
    "it suffices to prove that the number of different admissible colourings of the triangle(equivalently of the theta graph ) equals @xmath71 .",
    "the set of colours is given by @xmath9 and the admissibility conditions are given in equation @xmath72 .    by pondering a bit ; it is noticed that in order for a triple @xmath12 to satisfy the triangle inequalities , if @xmath73 with @xmath74 then @xmath75 once noticing this fact we need to count the number of ways the following equation is satisfied    @xmath76    by the inclusion - exclusion theorem , we first let the objects of the set to be the number of ways of decomposing an even number in a sum of three non - negative integers , which is given by    @xmath77    let a solution have property @xmath44 , if @xmath78 . applying the inclusion - exclusion principle",
    "this means that    @xmath79    @xmath80    therefore    @xmath81    for @xmath31 and @xmath45 we equally have that @xmath82 by the inclusion - exclusion principle    @xmath83    @xmath84 is the number of solutions in non - negative integers to the equation @xmath85 for a particular value @xmath86 .    finally the number @xmath21 is given by summing over all @xmath86    @xmath87    it is easily seen that the number of different admissible colourings of the triangle is equivalent to the number of different admissible colourings of the theta spin network graph .    in a similar spirit to the one edge observable entropy for the triangle entropy we can say that the entropy is dominated by the most probable geometrical outcomes , which happens for triangles with larger length sides .",
    "this happens for equilateral triangles .    in this section",
    "we have studied the shannon entropy of some spin network observables .",
    "the outcomes of measurements of the observables are geometrical in nature , they are mathematical and should only be seen in this way .",
    "a physical interpretation is less possible since the theory we are dealing with here is the turaev - viro one .",
    "it is only a toy and simple spin foam model of 3-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "however let us only say that the measurements we are talking about here , since they are geometrical , physically we could say that there is an apparatus which measures the geometry of space - time ; and which for instance in the edge observable case it gives squared length measures with certain probabilities .",
    "at the moment we are only proposing that this idea may be extended to the 4-dimensional case and which may give information about measures of the space - time geometry .    in the next section we generalise to",
    "further and general examples of spin network observables .",
    "we can continue computing the shannon entropy of different observable graphs .",
    "all these observables are imbedded on the triangulated three dimensional manifold @xmath1 as a subset of edges .",
    "it is important to point out that a very different shannon entropy for the quantum gravitational field was studied in @xcite .",
    "the entropy introduced in such reference is related to the hamiltonian density matrix of loop quantum gravity and it is not known how to interpret it in the language of a probability distribution .    in the present paper we have that the observable spin networks we are dealing with , have a probability distribution related to the colours of its edges .",
    "we now suggest that in a general way we can define the shannon entropy associated to any spin network graph .",
    "consider a trivalent graph with the following properties :    let @xmath88 be a trivalent graph with @xmath89 vertices and @xmath90 edges and with @xmath91 loops(@xmath92 ) .",
    "define a colouring of its edges from the set @xmath9 to be admissible if at each vertex the colours of its three edges are admissible , that is , for each vertex we have that its three edges adjacent to it satisfy equation @xmath72 .    the linear space generated by the admissible colourings of the graph @xmath88 is called the space of conformal blocks on a riemann surface of genus @xmath91 .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we denote this space by @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the inequality of theorem 1 suggests that the shannon entropy of the triangle observable ( or theta spin network graph ) is bounded by the logarithm of the dimension of the space of conformal blocks of the genus two torus of level @xmath94 .",
    "the dimension of the space of conformal blocks @xmath95 on a genus @xmath91 riemann surface was obtained in @xcite .",
    "we can write down the inequality of theorem 1 as    @xmath96    the shannon entropy of a trivalent graph @xmath88 with @xmath89 vertices and @xmath90 edges and with @xmath91 loops(@xmath92 ) is bounded by its maximal possible value @xmath97 where @xmath98 is its set of probabilities and @xmath99 is the number of non - zero probabilities .",
    "the dimension of the space of conformal blocks is generated by the number of admissible colourings of the corresponding spin network graph , therefore the inequality follows .",
    "the difference to proving theorem 1 and theorem 2 is that in theorem 1 , we know exactly that the number of different admissible colourings of the theta graph is given by @xmath100 since we computed it using the inclusion - exclusion theorem .",
    "however , in theorem 2 we know that the number of admissible colourings of the corresponding trivalent spin network graphs is given by the dimension of the space of conformal graphs of the associated riemann surface . what we lacked of is the fact that we are not able to compute the number of admissible colourings using the same procedure as in theorem 1 . trying to apply",
    "the same procedure is more challenging",
    ". however the inequality still follows .",
    "now the reader may wonder , how exactly do we assign probabilities to each labelling of the graph @xmath88  ?    the answer is as follows : given a trivalent graph @xmath88 with @xmath89 vertices and @xmath90 edges and with @xmath91 loops(@xmath92 ) the set of probabilities is calculated by    @xmath101    where the squared evaluation of the graph on the right hand side of the formula @xmath102 is calculated using the recoupling theory of the spin network graph .",
    "for instance for the case of genus @xmath103 the spin network graph is given by a tetrahedron .",
    "its set of probabilities implies the bound inequality    @xmath104    we have defined the shannon entropy of spin network graph observables .",
    "we have shown that the value of the entropy is bounded . a precise meaning for the measures of the observables",
    "were made for the one edge observable and the triangle observable .",
    "an interpretation of the general spin network measurements and of the shannon entropy is a bit unknown at the moment by the author .",
    "it can only be said that something geometrical about the space - time is to be expected .",
    "maybe the geometry of space - time can be recovered from the information of the measurements we have described , and it can be indeed studied for 4-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "however for the moment we do not know about it and what we have presented are good mathematical ideas to be interpreted in future .",
    "we have introduced a way to define the shannon entropy of spin network graphs in the case of euclidean three dimensional quantum gravity .    when considering the set of colours @xmath9 , we have written down an inequality which bounds the shannon entropy of a spin network graph @xmath88 . in particular we have proved that the shannon entropy of a triangle(or theta spin network graph )",
    "is bounded by @xmath71 ; and we have proved it in a completely combinatorial way .",
    "now , we pose the following questions for a future work .",
    "first of all , what is the shannon entropy of a spin network graph ? or in other words , what information can we extract from it ?",
    "how is it related to the entropy studied in @xcite , @xcite ?    in the combinatorial context",
    "an interesting question is ; can we prove for the case of the tetrahedron that the shannon entropy is bounded by the logarithm of @xmath105 .",
    "that is ; is there a proof analogous to the one of theorem 1 which uses the the inclusion - exclusion theorem ?",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the dimension of the space of conformal blocks has an analytic expression for any surface of any genus @xmath91 .",
    "our question now is ; is there a way to prove combinatorially(using the inclusion - exclusion technique ) that the dimension of the space conformal blocks of the riemann surface of genus @xmath106 is the account number of formula ( 16 ) . and",
    "if such combinatorial technique works for the genus @xmath107 and genus @xmath106 surfaces , can we find a combinatorial algorithm(using the inclusion - exclusion technique ) to produce a formula for the dimension of the space of conformal blocks other than the analytical one found in @xcite and in all of the literature ?",
    "prove that for the tetrahedron graph which represents a riemann surface of genus @xmath103 , @xmath108 using only combinatorial techniques ( the inclusion - exclusion theorem . )    another very interesting question is how the shannon entropy we studied here is related to the one studied in @xcite .",
