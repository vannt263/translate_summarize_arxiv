    "turbulent flows display transport properties strongly enhanced with respect to those of laminar flows , a feature that has particularly important consequences in configurations of engineering interest . understanding how a given laminar flow becomes turbulent or a turbulent flow decays to laminar is therefore of great interest , both conceptual and practical . in this respect ,",
    "the case of wall - bounded flows is of utmost concern since the transition can be direct , without the intermediate steps observed , e.g. in free shear flows  ( huerre & rossi 1998 , manneville 2015 ) .",
    "this direct transition is a result of the local stability of laminar flow in competition with nontrivial solutions to the navier  stokes equation ( nse for short ) in the range of control parameter where the transition effectively takes place .",
    "as analysed by waleffe  ( 1997 ) , the mechanism by which such nontrivial solutions exist , the self - sustainment process ( ssp ) , is now thought to be well understood , but the laminar - turbulent coexistence still raises important questions . in hagen  poiseuille flow ( hpf ) , the flow under pressure gradient through a circular pipe , the transition takes place when turbulent _ puffs _ , the nontrivial states alluded to above , split and propagate turbulence before they have time to decay , a scenario well - reproduced by a reaction - diffusion model introduced by barkley  ( 2011a ) . in its own transitional range , plane couette flow ( pcf ) , the simple shear flow developing between counter - translating plates , experiences laminar - turbulent coexistence in the form of steady oblique bands ( prigent _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , duget _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 , barkley & tuckerman 2005 ) .",
    "the reynolds number , the relevant control parameter , is here defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the speed of the plates , @xmath2 the half gap width between them , and @xmath3 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the _ bands _ are observed for @xmath4 . below the global stability threshold @xmath5 turbulence",
    "is only transient , in the form of finite - lifetime _",
    "spots _ , and the laminar base flow is always recovered after the spots have decayed . beyond the upper threshold @xmath6 turbulence",
    "is essentially _ featureless _ , i.e. uniform . a model , also of reaction - diffusion type , was proposed by one of us  ( manneville 2012 ) to account for this pattern formation , in which a turing mechanism was proposed to be responsible for the bands when @xmath7 is decreased below @xmath6 .",
    "such explicative models are analogical in essence . trying to support them directly from a reliable simplification of the primitive problem in",
    "order find out the physical mechanisms behind laminar - turbulent coexistence is the actual purpose of the work presented here .    in the transitional range ,",
    "the nontrivial solutions appear to be strongly coherent at the scale of the distance to the wall , pipe diameter  ( hof _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) or gap between plates  ( bottin _ et al .",
    "this feature can be incorporated in the sought - for models using galerkin methods that project the solutions and their dynamics on well - chosen functional bases  ( finlayson 1972 ) .",
    "such a method was used by waleffe to build a dynamical system implementing the ssp for pcf with stress - free boundary conditions directly from the nse  ( waleffe 1997 ) .",
    "his model is a system of ordinary differential equations governing the amplitude of velocity components involved in the ssp upon assuming full coherence at the scale of a minimal flow unit  ( jimnez & moin 1991 ) , with size of the order of the distance between the walls .",
    "though valuable to discuss the ssp , this assumption is not appropriate to study the extended systems of interest , long pipes or wide channels .",
    "the method can however be adapted to such cases for which the variables have to be field amplitudes governed by partial differential equations still involving spatial coordinates rather than scalars functions of time satisfying ordinary differential systems .",
    "basically , coherence in the flow is taken into account by projecting the hydrodynamic variables onto a limited number of wall - normal modes with corresponding amplitudes depending on the remaining coordinates , axial for pipe flow , in - plane for pcf . in spirit , this modelling approach can be considered as the analytical implementation of a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) scheme in which the wall - normal spectral resolution would be varied in a controlled fashion . when practiced in a strictly numerical context ( manneville & rolland 2011 ) , this strategy showed that laminar - turbulent bands in transitional pcf are remarkably robust since they are preserved upon drastically reducing the number of chebyshev polynomial used to represent the wall - normal dependence of the flow .",
    "as the resolution was decreased , the quantitative price to be paid was a progressive narrowing of the reynolds number range where the bands were observed , accompanied by a downwards shift of that range explained by an aborted energy transfer towards small scales , whereas the main properties of the pattern were preserved qualitatively speaking .    performing more work `` by hand ''",
    "would yield equations that would be more cumbersome than the nse but would encode wall - normal coherence at the moderate reynolds numbers of interest in a crucial way . eliminating supposedly less relevant degrees of freedom ,",
    "we can hope for better physical understanding and for higher numerical efficiency since the physical dimension of the problem would then be reduced from three to two .",
    "the limit would of course be that the obtained equations be still manageable .",
    "here , we present an extension of a previous galerkin model by lagha and one of us ( lagha & manneville 2007a ) that pursues this agenda . in that study ,",
    "the model was truncated at lowest significant order and retained only three fields .",
    "it displayed most of the expected qualitative properties except for the presence of any organised laminar - turbulent coexistence in wide domains  ( manneville 2009 ) .",
    "taking into consideration the previously mentioned simulation results at reduced resolution ( manneville & rolland 2011 ) we surmised that this deficiency would be corrected by truncating the expansion at a higher level . with four more fields ,",
    "numerical simulations display the expected patterns as described in section  [ s3 ] , therefore validating the approach sketched in section  [ s2 ] .",
    "perspectives opened by this approach will be discussed in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "the explicit expression of the model is given in  [ a ] .",
    "the derivation follows previous work in ( lagha & manneville 2007a ) with the difference that , in order to avoid difficulties in the treatment of the pressure field , the nse governing the departure from laminar flow is now written in a velocity - vorticity formulation as described in  ( schmid & henningson 2001 ) , p.155ff , i.e. the ( nonlinear ) orr  sommerfeld equation for the wall - normal velocity component @xmath8 : @xmath9 and the squire equation for the wall - normal vorticity component @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the streamwise @xmath13 and spanwise @xmath14 velocity components , respectively : @xmath15 in these general equations the base flow is @xmath16 . when dealing with pcf , using the half - gap width @xmath2 as length unit and @xmath17 as time unit , with @xmath1 the speed of the plates driving the flow at @xmath18 we have @xmath19 .",

    "is again as expected , however the occurrence of large - scale laminar - turbulent coexistence in the form of oblique bands , easily detected visually and permitting the identification of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , leaves a weaker signature on the variation of @xmath154 with @xmath7 than in dnss for which a marked break at @xmath6 and a linear decrease below were observed . here",
    "the smoother variation of @xmath155 and the absence of clear - cut change at @xmath6 between the band regime ( open circles ) and uniform turbulence ( filled circles ) are presumably again a direct consequence of the higher level of fluctuations .",
    "below @xmath156 , turbulence is only transient but a mean energy , roughly constant before the decay stage , can still be measured ( open square ) . in principle @xmath5",
    "should be located using a statistical study in line with the approach in terms of chaotic transients , like in ( lagha & manneville , 2007a ) .",
    "its detection _ via _ a single experiment where @xmath7 was progressively decreased by small steps has been judged sufficient for the present purpose .    finally , in a very wide domain @xmath157 of size comparable to that of the largest experimental setups  ( prigent _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , patterns with many wavelengths were obtained . comparing figure  [ 680x340 ]     at @xmath140 . to reach such a size ,",

    "we have however noted certain quantitative discrepancies .",
    "first the transitional range is shifted downwards somewhat more importantly than in the dnss  ( manneville & rolland 2011 ) .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the amount of energy extracted from the base flow by viscous stresses at the plates is transferred though a very short range of wall - normal small scales most likely to dissipate it .",
    "this artificially maintains more turbulent activity in the system at given @xmath7 , or equivalently a similar turbulence level at lower @xmath7 , than in better resolved simulations and laboratory experiments where energy is transferred to and efficiently dissipated in much smaller scales .",
    "( there is little or no trade - off for the in - plane dissipation that is treated like in the full-3d dnss . ) for a concrete comparison , experiments ( prigent _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and well - resolved full-3d dnss ( duguet _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) give the upper threshold ( featureless turbulence ) at @xmath160 and the lower threshold ( global stability ) at @xmath161 . in simulations at reduced resolution (",
    "manneville & rolland 2011 ) , @xmath162 being the number of chebyshev polynomials used in the representation of the wall - normal dependence , these values are shifted down to 350 and 270 for @xmath163 and to 275 and 215 for @xmath164 .",
    "here we have @xmath139 and @xmath138 but the pattern is still well rendered .",
    "this larger shift can therefore be understood because the effective wall - normal resolution is much lower .",
    "the fact that a physically relevant solution is obtained here while the chebyshev implementation breaks down with similarly few modes is due the optimal rendering of boundary conditions on @xmath8 achieved by our basis choice ( see below ) .",
    "second , though the angle between the bands and the streamwise direction is correct , the wavelengths of the pattern , both streamwise and spanwise , are too short by a factor of 1.5 to 2 , and the pattern s orientation in domains of intermediate size fluctuates more than in the dnss .",
    "the amount of enhancement is however difficult to appreciate quantitatively .",
    "these phenomena remain unexplained for the moment but might relate to the effect of the wall - normal resolution on the streamwise coherence that was shown to play an important role on the existence of the pattern ( philip & manneville 2011 ) .",
    "a  hand - waving confirmation of this effect on the robustness of the bands comes from the continuous trend observed as the resolution is decreased , here as the truncation level @xmath43 is lowered , in rough correspondence with what was observed when reducing the wall - normal resolution in dnss .",
    "first , a conspicuous steady pattern is observed with @xmath109 .",
    "next , for @xmath165 ( not reported here but studied in parallel ) coexistence of fluctuating , wide , laminar and turbulent domains are observed in an even narrower reynolds range ; these domains remain disorganised and do not form bands .",
    "finally , for @xmath166  ( lagha & manneville 2007a ) , streaks stay short , the transitional range seems to be reduced to a point at a somewhat larger value ( @xmath167 ) , and wide steady coexisting domains do not exist : either turbulent domains grow from small germs in a laminar background or the reverse ( manneville 2009 ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a similar but worse situation occurred in full 3d simulations at exaggeratedly reduced resolution since nontrivial states with unphysical small scales and no patterns were obtained for @xmath168 and @xmath169 and blow - up occurred for @xmath170 , which give a marked advantage to our separately optimal wall - normal representations of @xmath8 and @xmath62 .",
    "these observations should contain some physics that warrant to be elucidated , as suggested in the next section .",
    "understanding the transition to turbulence in wall - bounded flows , and especially pcf that is linearly stable for all @xmath7 and displays alternating laminar and turbulent oblique stripes on its way to fully developed turbulence , is a hard problem when starting from the nse .",
    "some simplification can be expected by taking a key ingredient into account : the transition takes place at moderate values of the reynolds number for which the flow is controlled by the presence of coherent structures  ( hof _ al al .",
    "_ 2004 ; bottin _ et al .",
    "the model that we have derived incorporates this feature by means of a galerkin expansion of the dynamics optimally adapted to the boundary conditions at the walls . truncating",
    "the expansion beyond lowest nontrivial order , keeping 7  amplitudes instead of 3 in ( lagha & manneville 2007a , b ) , has allowed us to recover the experimentally and numerically observed patterning at minimal price ( downward shift of the transitional range , somewhat too short pattern wavelengths )",
    ". this limitation can be overcome by increasing @xmath43 , which raises the interesting question of the rate of convergence of the approximation .",
    "such a study would possibly be rewarding because , to be precise , dnss treating the three space directions on a similar footing are computationally extremely demanding  ( duguet _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) . in a spirit akin to that of large eddy simulations",
    ", the present modelling avoids to waste numerical resources by singling out hydrodynamic coherence in the wall - normal direction and skipping the explicit computation of the small scales .",
    "an indication that the convergence of our approach could be fast is the observation reported by one of us ",
    "see fig .",
    "b6 in ( manneville 2015 )  that the fraction of the perturbation energy retained in projections of fully resolved numerical solutions onto the basis considered here tends to 1 exponentially fast as the truncation order is increased : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 for @xmath166 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "this does not prove that the global dynamics of the system would be equally well captured quantitatively by increasing the number @xmath176 of fields in the model but hints at such a convergence , as generally expected for spectral approaches , here relying on specific complete series of jacobi polynomials ( rolland 2012 ) . at the price of a pre - treatment of the problem that amounts to the once - for - all automated derivation of an effective set of equations of sufficiently high order , it might be found interesting to replace the full 3 d numerical simulations of the nse by a finite set of two - dimensional partial differential equations already taking the continuity condition fully into account and managing with wall - normal coherence in the transitional range .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the expected gain in terms of memory requirements and time steps definitely warrants further study .    in a complementary perspective",
    ", one can rather think of analysing the properties of the model .",
    "first , in - plane coherence may be added to the wall - normal coherence inherent in the derivation .",
    "this can be done by inserting specific assumptions about the @xmath96-dependence of fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in particular strict periodicity in space at the scale of the mfu  ( jimnez & moin 1991 ) . with @xmath108 and further limiting the in - plane expansion to the first harmonic , it is then straightforward to recover waleffe s models  ( waleffe 1997 ) by making the corresponding educated guess . a system of eight equations for eight amplitudes is obtained , identical to his system  ( 10 ) but with a different set of coefficients acknowledging the difference in boundary conditions ( which , in passing , shows the structural genericity of that model ) .",
    "for example , the equation for the streamwise mean - flow component called @xmath177 by waleffe and governed by his equation ( 10a ) here reads : @xmath178\\ ] ] where @xmath179 , while other symbols have the same definition as in  ( waleffe 1997 ) , especially the streamwise and spanwise wave - vectors @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 being the dimensions of the mfu .",
    "the numerical values of coefficients in the equation above can be obtained from the formal expressions in  [ a ] . following the very same line",
    ", a study to be presented elsewhere  ( manneville , in preparation ) shows that uniform large scale flows are generated just by shifting the phase of specific ingredients of waleffe s eight - equation model .",
    "combining this to the introduction of appropriately weighted in - plane second harmonics should help us to account for oblique coherent structures like those recently found by daly and schneider  ( 2014 ) , though the actual derivation of a model possessing them as fixed points would be cumbersome .    beyond the simple hypotheses corresponding to strictly periodic coherent structures",
    ", the next step is to describe spatially slow turbulence modulations corresponding to the patterns observed experimentally through the formal introduction of a slow dependence of the amplitude of the local bifurcated state , in the spirit of the derivation of standard multiple - scale envelope equations .",
    "the approach can not be made as rigorous as , e.g. , for convection the since the bifurcated state stays at finite distance from the laminar - flow base , which leaves room for further modelling .",
    "of the two scales introduced , the fast one accounts for mechanisms at the mfu scale and the slow one corresponds to the modulations .",
    "the slow variables are driven by source terms arising from a filtering of the reynolds stresses , like in  ( lagha & manneville 2007b ) and it can be seen that the modulation of the uniform large scale flows alluded to above generates nonlocal contributions of the class identified by hayot and pomeau  ( 1994 ) as playing an essential role in the balance between laminar and turbulent regions responsible for patterning .",
    "but , in contrast with their phenomenological introduction of such contributions , here they directly arise from the equations and are therefore sensitive to the local orientation of the flow with respect to the streamwise direction , hopefully giving a microscopic support to the empirical observations of duguet and schlatter ( 2013 ) .",
    "finally , large scale flows are present already with @xmath184  ( lagha & manneville 2007b ; manneville , in preparation ) , though steady patterns are not observed in that case  ( manneville 2009 ) .",
    "taking smaller wall - normal scales into account ( @xmath185 ) is therefore necessary for a theoretical interpretation of the stabilisation of long - wave modulations observed with @xmath109 , as reported in  [ s3 ] .",
    "simplification of models with higher truncation levels would then take advantage of the diagonal dominance of matrices @xmath72 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 noticed earlier to perform the adiabatic elimination of terms of least relevance yielding an effective model for the slowly evolving terms .",
    "such a heavy work could however possibly not be necessary and considering seven fields might be sufficient up to an optimisation of the model s coefficients . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the three first amplitudes @xmath186 are the most appropriate to deal with the nontrivial properties of the in - plane flow dependence .",
    "so , if one is willing to include more of the wall - normal dependence , it should suffice to consider that the pairs @xmath187 and @xmath188 collect all the higher order contributions of each parity and , owing to its generic structure , to restrict oneself to the consideration of the seven - field model as an effective system replacing the nse . in this perspective , except as a starting guess , sticking to the values of the coefficients obtained in the strict galerkin expansion is not advisable and introducing some multiplicative randomness at appropriate strategic places like in ( barkley 2011b ) seems profitable . applying the program sketched in the previous paragraph to this new primitive problem",
    "is currently developed , which is expected to improve over the one - dimensional phenomenological approaches of manneville ( 2012 ) and  hayot & pomeau ( 1994 ) .",
    "the subcritical coexistence of different regimes forming laminar and turbulent patterns in pcf and other wall - bounded flow configurations is a difficult problem in which the interplay of mean flow corrections and finite amplitude perturbations plays a crucial role .",
    "our approach _ via _",
    "galerkin decomposition yields explicit models replacing the nse by coupled systems governing amplitudes that encode the gross features of the flow .",
    "the derivation is systematic and the structure of the obtained models is generic , reflecting that of the primitive equations .",
    "simulations of those models reproduce the patterning provided that the truncation level is not too low .",
    "they are next amenable to further analysis , especially through in - plane space dependence assumptions and explicit scale separation . here",
    ", this program has been developed for pcf but its adaptation to other flows such as plane poiseuille or couette  poiseuille flow , cylindrical couette ",
    "taylor flow , etc .",
    "is straightforward . obtaining a barkley - like model for hagen  poiseuille flow from first principles",
    "can also be considered along similar lines , using basis functions adapted to the tube geometry and the no - slip condition .",
    "the extension to the less trivial case of boundary layer flows of various kinds , with their free - stream boundaries at infinity , remains a stimulating challenge .",
    "once obtained such models offer tools to scrutinise laminar - turbulent coexistence and provide us with detailed physical explanations of this phenomenon of great conceptual and practical importance .",
