    "the dynamical evolution of galactic systems depends crucially on their orbital structure and in particular on what fraction of their orbits is regular , or chaotic . thus to permit further studies , it is essential to be able to distinguish between these two types of orbits in a manner that is both safe and efficient .",
    "this is not trivial and becomes yet more complicated in systems of many degrees of freedom .",
    "a summary of the methods that have been developed over the years can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we use a method based on the properties of two deviation vectors of an orbit , the  smaller alingment index \" ( sali ) @xcite .",
    "it has been applied successfully in different dynamical systems @xcite , frequently also under the name alignment index ( ai ) @xcite and has been shown to be a fast and easy to compute indicator of the chaotic or ordered nature of orbits .",
    "we first recall its definition and we then show its effectiveness in distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion by applying it to a barred potential of 2 and 3 degrees of freedom . recently , a generalization of the sali , the  generalized alignment index \" ( gali ) was introduced by skokos et al .",

    "let us consider the @xmath4dimensional phase space of a conservative dynamical system , which could be a symplectic map or a hamiltonian flow .",
    "we consider also an orbit in that space with initial condition @xmath5 and two deviation vectors @xmath6 , @xmath7 from the initial point @xmath8 . in order to compute the sali for a given orbit one",
    "has to follow the time evolution of the orbit itself , as well as two deviation vectors @xmath9 which initially point in two different directions . at every time",
    "step the two deviation vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 are normalized by setting :    @xmath12    and the sali is then computed as :    @xmath13    the properties of the time evolution of the sali clearly distinguish between regular and chaotic motion as follows : in the case of hamiltonian flows or dimensional symplectic maps with @xmath14 , the sali fluctuates around a non  zero value for regular orbits @xcite .",
    "in general , two different initial deviation vectors become tangent to different directions on the torus , producing different sequences of vectors , so that sali does not tend to zero but fluctuates around positive values . on the other hand , for chaotic orbits",

    "[ perc_a]b we present the corresponding percentages of regular , chaotic and sticky orbits . we find that , using these initial conditions and parameters , the phase space of the model is dominated by chaotic orbits , since 77.54@xmath87 of them are chaotic .    in order to check the variation of the percentages of regular and chaotic orbits as the energy of the model varies , we did the following :  we first sorted the energy values for all the initial conditions .",
    "then , we created 30 energy intervals containing equal number of orbits , since our way of giving initial conditions does not imply their uniform distribution in the total energy interval . in every energy interval we calculated the percentages of regular and chaotic orbits , considering as chaotic all the orbits with sali@xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ perce]a we show the percentage of regular orbits in each energy interval , as a function of the mean energy in that interval . generally , the percentage of regular orbits decreases as the energy increases , but before and after the escape energy ( where the jacobi constant value is @xmath89 ) there are two peaks .",
    "this non  monotonic behavior is related to the appearance or disappearance of stable periodic orbits in the phase space and the size variation of the stability regions around them .",
    "we also attempted to explore the way that regular and chaotic orbits are distributed along the @xmath18direction of the configuration space .",
    "following the evolution of each orbit , we calculated the mean of the absolute value of their @xmath18 coordinate ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "then , we divided the available @xmath90interval in 30 slices with equal number of orbits in each one of them .",
    "this restriction gives us better samples for the estimation of the percentages , implying at the same time that these slices are not equally sized necessarily .",
    "for every slice separately we calculated the fraction of regular orbits and in fig .",
    "[ perce]b we plot these percentages as a function of the @xmath90 in that slice .",
    "it reveals that the slices ` near ' the @xmath2plane ( @xmath91 ) contain mainly ` regular ' orbits .",
    "contrarily , slices for larger values of @xmath18 host mainly chaotic motion .",
    "furthermore , we looked at these percentages as a function of the initial spherical radius ( @xmath85 ) and the mean spherical radius ( @xmath86 , meaned over the evolution ) .",
    "again , dividing in 30 slices the total range of the @xmath85 , in a similar manner with the @xmath90 , we calculated the percentages of regular orbits .",
    "we plot this for every slice , as a function of the mean @xmath85 of that slice .",
    "we see that the fraction of regular orbits decreases strongly with increasing @xmath85 up to @xmath92 where it reaches a minimum , while for @xmath93 this percentage starts increasing gradually .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the results in fig .",
    "[ perce]d , where the horizontal axis corresponds to the value of the spherical radius meaned over time during the evolution .",
    "we used sali to study the dynamical behavior of hamiltonian models of 2d and 3d barred galaxies .",
    "we found that in both cases there is a significant amount of chaotic orbits . in the 2d model",
    ", we were able to chart a subspace of the phase space , to identify rapidly even tiny regions of regular motion and measure their percentages . in the 3d model , apart from computing the global percentages of regular and chaotic orbits , we calculated these percentages as a function of the energy and found that low values of the energy are mainly dominated by ` regular ' orbital motion .",
    "we also followed the distribution of the chaotic and regular orbits in the configuration space and we found that orbits which lie near the @xmath2plane with relatively small mean deviations in @xmath18direction are generally regular .",
    "finally , we monitored the variation of their percentages as a function of their initial spherical radius and their mean spherical radius .",
    "we find that the fraction of regular orbits is dominant in regions near the center , as well as at relatively larger distances from it .",
