    "the simplest gauge extension of the standard model involves one or more additional @xmath8 symmetries and their associated extra @xmath9 bosons . such @xmath8 s often emerge in the breaking of grand unified theories ( gut ) or in string compactifications , for example .",
    "there has been much phenomenological work on the implications of such heavy @xmath9 s for precision electroweak observables and for future hadron and @xmath10 colliders .",
    "present @xcite and future @xcite limits as well as search and diagnostic capabilities depend on the @xmath4 mass , mixing with the @xmath9 , gauge couplings , and chiral charges of the ordinary quarks and leptons , and are thus very model dependent . for many typical ( especially gut - motivated ) models the limits on the @xmath3 mixing are around a few @xmath11 .",
    "the lower limits on the @xmath4 mass are typically around 500 gev , usually dominated by direct searches at the tevatron ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , but with constraints from precision electroweak tests often competitive .",
    "recently , a number of authors @xcite have postulated that a possible excess of @xmath13 events at lep could be accounted for by the mixing between the @xmath9 and a leptophobic ( hadrophilic ) @xmath4 which mainly couples to quarks , but the most recent lep data , especially from aleph , have considerably weakened the case that there is an excess @xcite . in the future it should be possible to discover a heavy @xmath4 at the lhc for masses up to around 10 tev .",
    "diagnostics of its couplings at the lhc or nlc ( which have complementary capabilities ) should be possible up to a few tev @xcite .",
    "in addition to being a useful signature of the underlying theory , an additional @xmath0 would have important theoretical implications .",
    "for example , an extra @xmath0 breaking at the electroweak scale in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model could solve the @xmath2 problem @xcite , by forbidding an elementary @xmath2 term but inducing an effective @xmath2 at the electroweak scale by the @xmath0 breaking .",
    "this possibility is one of the major motivations of this paper .",
    "there are also implications for baryogenesis .",
    "one popular scenario is that a lepton asymmetry @xcite ( or an asymmetry in some other quantum number ) was created by the out of equilibrium decay of a superheavy particle ( e.g. , a heavy majorana neutrino ) long before the electroweak transition , and then converted to a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron effects .",
    "such a mechanism would not be consistent with an additional @xmath0 at the tev or electroweak scale unless the majorana neutrino were neutral under the @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , an extra @xmath0 might be useful for electroweak baryogenesis , with cosmic strings providing the needed `` out of equilibrium '' ingredient @xcite .",
    "much of the phenomenological work on extra @xmath4s has been of the lamppost variety , i.e. , there was no strong motivation to think that an extra @xmath4 would actually be light enough to observe .",
    "certainly , in ordinary guts there is no robust prediction for the mass scale of the @xmath0 breaking . in supersymmetric models",
    "there are constraints on the breaking scale , which are usually of order a tev , because the @xmath0 d term may induce masses of order of the breaking for all scalars which carry the @xmath0 charge @xcite .",
    "however , that is more a phenomenological constraint than a theoretical prediction , and it can be evaded if the breaking occurs along a d  flat direction .",
    "however , it was recently argued @xcite that for a large class of string models with extra @xmath8 s , the breaking should be at the electroweak scale and certainly not larger than a tev .",
    "the string models considered in @xcite are based on @xmath14 supersymmetric string models with the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath15 , three families , and at least two standard model ( sm ) doublets , i.e. , models with at least the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "a number of such models are based on fermionic ( @xmath16 ) orbifold constructions @xcite at a particular point in moduli space .",
    "such models suffer from a number of phenomenological problems ( see section  ii in @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , and many such models are already excluded experimentally .",
    "nevertheless , there is a strong motivation to search for such @xmath4 bosons and also for the exotic ( vector under @xmath17 ) supermultiplets with which they are usually associated .",
    "in addition , they provide a useful testing ground to address the issues of @xmath0 breaking within a large class of string models .",
    "the relevant models are those in which : ( a ) there is a non - anomalous @xmath0 which does not acquire a large mass from string or shadow sector dynamics , so that its mass must come from symmetry breaking in the observable sector .",
    "( b ) the soft supersymmetry breaking is such that all scalar mass - squared terms are positive and of the same order of magnitude at the string scale , which is the case for most gravity mediated hidden sector models ( but not necessarily for the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models that have been of recent interest )",
    ".    under these assumptions , the @xmath0 breaking may be radiative @xcite .",
    "it can take place if there are yukawa couplings of order 1 of a scalar which is a standard model singlet ( but which carries a @xmath18 charge ) to exotic particles .",
    "this is expected in many string models , for which all non - zero yukawas are typically of the same magnitude , i.e. , they are the same as the gauge coupling at the string scale up to a coefficient of order unity",
    ". these can drive the scalar mass - squared to a negative value at low energies , which is typically of the same order as the higgs mass - squared , so that the electroweak and @xmath0 breaking scales are comparable , both being controlled by the same soft supersymmetry breaking scale .    in @xcite ,",
    "a model was considered in which _ only one _ ( e.g. , @xmath19 ) of the two sm higgs doublets has non - zero couplings in the superpotential and contributes to the electroweak breaking ; i.e. , this model roughly corresponds to the large @xmath20 scenario in the mssm .",
    "the radiative symmetry breaking can take place with @xmath21 , and sufficiently small @xmath3 mixing angle ( not yet excluded by the direct and indirect heavy @xmath4 constraints ) , provided the @xmath0 charge assignments for the the @xmath19 and the sm singlet @xmath22 ( responsible for the symmetry breaking of @xmath0 ) have the same sign .",
    "in this paper we consider the more general case with the two sm doublets @xmath23 now coupled to the sm singlet @xmath24 in the superpotential with the term @xmath25 . in this case , the @xmath0 charges of @xmath26 and @xmath24 must sum to zero .",
    "this term provides an effective @xmath2 term @xmath27 , once @xmath1 acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value .    due to this additional term in the superpotential ,",
    "a rich spectrum of possible symmetry breaking scenarios emerges .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on a set of phenomenologically viable scenarios with small @xmath3 mixing ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath6 in the range @xmath29 tev@xmath30 .",
    "we also insist on no dangerous color breaking minimum , e.g. , no negative squark mass - squared parameters or large trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking terms that involve squarks .",
    "we find various ranges of parameters that allow for such symmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "however , all these cases involve some degree of fine - tuning of parameters , either at the electroweak scale or at the string scale is small compared to @xmath2 , e.g. , for @xmath31 . ] .",
    "a few percent of the parameter space gives a phenomenologically acceptable @xmath0 symmetry breaking scenario .",
    "this fact is important since it implies that in this class of string models there is a reasonable probability that the heavy @xmath4 is in the experimentally observable region ( and not required to become massive at the string scale ) .",
    "in addition , these models provide an elegant solution to the @xmath2 problem , complementary to that of the giudice - masiero mechanism @xcite the required terms in the k \" ahler potential are absent ; thus the giudice - masiero mechanism is not applicable .",
    "other possible solutions are surveyed in @xcite . ] .    in sec .",
    "ii we give explicit expressions for the scalar potential , vector boson masses , scalar masses and related sparticle masses , and introduce certain definitions and conventions that will be used throughout the work .    in sec .",
    "iii , we present scenarios to obtain a small @xmath3 mixing angle based on that portion of parameter space in which the trilinear coupling is much greater than the soft mass parameters . in this case",
    "@xmath6 is typically comparable to @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 .",
    "this scenario is only viable for certain ( e.g. , leptophobic ) couplings .",
    "one version of the model has a first order electroweak phase transition at tree level and thus has potentially interesting cosmological consequences .    in sec .",
    "iv , we present a scenario in which the singlet acquires a large vev so that @xmath35 . in this case , all of the dimensional parameters in the scalar potential are of @xmath36 and the smaller electroweak scale is due to a cancellation of parameters .    in section",
    "v , we use the renormalization group to relate the electroweak scale supersymmetry breaking parameters to those at the string scale .",
    "we first assume the minimal particle content , consisting of the mssm particles , the additional singlet , and the @xmath4 .",
    "we present the results of the numerical integration of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the parameters of the model as a function of their boundary conditions at the string scale . with the minimal particle content , we conclude that it is necessary to invoke nonuniversal values of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the string scale to reach the desired low energy region of parameter space .",
    "several examples of boundary conditions at the string scale are presented which lead to the phenomenologically acceptable scenarios of sec .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "we also discuss the implications of additional exotic matter in the rges , and conclude that with additional @xmath37 triplets , for example , the large singlet vev scenario is possible with universal boundary conditions .",
    "the rges are presented in appendix a. in appendix b , we present the details of the numerical results , and we give semi - analytic solutions of the rges . finally , in appendix c we present examples of models with anomaly - free @xmath0 .",
    "our goal is to explore the general features of electroweak breaking in a class of string models , not to construct a specific model .",
    "we therefore focus on the gauge and symmetry breaking sectors of the theory and only specify the @xmath0 charges when we present concrete numerical examples .",
    "the gauge group is extended to @xmath38 with the couplings @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively , where @xmath43 is the gut normalized coupling .",
    "that is , @xmath41 is the coupling usually called @xmath44 in the standard model . ] .",
    "the particle content is given by the left - handed chiral superfields @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where the subscript @xmath53 is the family index .",
    "the superpotential for our model is forbids not only an elementary @xmath54 term in the superpotential , but also a term @xmath55 .",
    "such a term is needed in the nmssm @xcite to avoid the appearance of an axion after symmetry breaking . in our model , this massless pseudoscalar is eaten by the @xmath4 . also , unlike in the nmssm",
    "the discrete symmetry is embedded in the gauge symmetry and thus there is no domain wall problem . ]",
    "@xmath56 the form of ( [ superpot ] ) is motivated by string models @xcite , in which a given higgs doublet ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) only has yukawa couplings to a single ( third ) family .",
    "this family index will not be displayed in the rest of the paper .",
    "gauge invariance of @xmath58 under @xmath0 requires @xmath59 .",
    "the effective @xmath2 parameter is generated by the vev @xmath60 , and will then be given by @xmath61 .",
    "within string models there is no mechanism for supersymmetry breaking with quantitative predictive power .",
    "we thus parameterize supersymmetry breaking with the most general soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters .",
    "the soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian takes the form @xmath62 where the @xmath63 are gauginos , and the other fields are the scalar components of the corresponding supermultiplets .",
    "gauge symmetry breaking is now driven by the vacuum expectation values of the doublets @xmath64 , @xmath19 and the singlet @xmath1 .",
    "the higgs potential is the sum of three pieces : @xmath65 with @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 by an appropriate choice of the global phases of the fields , we can take @xmath71 real and positive without loss of generality . by a suitable gauge rotation",
    "we can also make @xmath72 and take @xmath73 and @xmath74 real and positive .",
    "the requirement @xmath75 in the vacuum is equivalent to requiring the squared mass of the physical charged scalar to be positive and imposes some constraint on the parameter space of the model , as will be shown later .",
    "there is no room for explicit or spontaneous cp violation in the potential ( [ pot ] ) so that @xmath76 is real .",
    "furthermore , with our choice @xmath77 one has @xmath78 in the true minimum .    even after the replacement of @xmath79 by @xmath80 , @xmath81 differs from the mssm by additional terms quadratic in the @xmath82 in @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the minimization conditions when all vevs are non - zero give @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    to ensure that the extremum at @xmath90 is a minimum of the potential",
    ", the squared masses of scalar higgses should be positive .",
    "in addition , @xmath91 should also hold for the minimum to be acceptable .",
    "even if all these conditions are satisfied , the minimum is not guaranteed to be the global minimum of the potential . whether it is still acceptable",
    "will depend on the location and depth of the other possible minima and of the barrier height and width between the minima @xcite .",

    "then , with good precision @xmath99 so that @xmath100 is fixed .    the spectrum of physical higgses after symmetry breaking consists of three neutral cp even scalars ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , one cp odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath103 ) and a pair of charged higgses ( @xmath104 ) , that is , one scalar more than in the mssm .",

    "this case will be studied in section iv .",
    "for the sake of simplifying the analysis , the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters can be written in terms of dimensionless parameters @xmath206 and an overall mass scale @xmath207 : @xmath208 since these are the only dimensional parameters in ( [ pot ] ) , one can conveniently parameterize the vevs as : @xmath209    we first minimize the potential ( [ pot ] ) with respect to the dimensionless parameters @xmath210 defined through ( [ rescalemass ] ) , ( [ rescalefields ] ) and then go to physical shell by choosing @xmath211 where @xmath100 sets the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in contrast to the usual mssm potential , @xmath81 in ( [ pot ] ) has an important trilinear term involving only the higgs fields .",
    "therefore , one can consider a symmetry breaking scenario driven by this large trilinear term , as opposed to the more common situation in which the value of the minimum is determined mainly by the signs and magnitudes of the soft mass - squared parameters @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",

    ", we consider the @xmath533 @xcite , which occurs in the breaking of @xmath534 to @xmath535 .",
    "it is not our intention to consider guts per se , but rather to use this as an existence proof of acceptable @xmath0 quantum numbers",
    ". the theory will be anomaly - free if the matter supermultiplets transform according to @xmath536 where @xmath537 and @xmath538 refer to 27-plets of @xmath534 .",
    "since the @xmath537 and @xmath539 pairs are vector , any submultiplets can have a string ( or gut ) scale mass and decouple without breaking the @xmath540 or introducing anomalies , and indeed in most string models one expects only parts of the @xmath541 to be present in the observable sector .",
    "it is convenient to display the decomposition of the @xmath537 under the @xmath542 subgroup , @xmath543 where the first and second quantities are the @xmath544 multiplet and @xmath545 , respectively . in ( [ decomp ] )",
    ", the @xmath546 constitutes an ordinary family , @xmath547 and @xmath548 are standard model singlets , and @xmath549 are exotic multiplets which form a vector pair under the standard model gauge group but are chiral under @xmath540 . in particular , @xmath550 consists of @xmath551 and @xmath383 , where @xmath219 is a color - triplet charge @xmath552 quark and @xmath383 has the standard model quantum numbers of the @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , @xmath553 consists of @xmath554 and @xmath555 , where @xmath555 has the quantum number of either the @xmath64 or a lepton doublet .",
    "any of the three @xmath555 s and three @xmath383 s have the appropriate quantum numbers to be the mssm higgs doublets .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath548 could be the singlet @xmath1 , with the two yukawa couplings in ( [ superpot ] ) allowed by @xmath540 .",
    "an exotic @xmath556 coupling , as in ( [ superpotex ] ) , is also allowed .",
    "hence , a model consisting of three 27-plets has most of the ingredients needed to display the considerations of this paper , albeit with additional singlets and @xmath557 pairs .",
    "the model as such is not consistent with the observed approximate gauge unification .",
    "the two extra @xmath557 pairs and the singlets do not affect the standard model gauge unification at one - loop .",
    "however , the @xmath219 and @xmath558 associated with the two higgs doublets destroy the unification , and they can not be made superheavy without breaking the @xmath540 and also introducing anomalies in the effective low - energy theory .",
    "gauge unification can be restored without introducing anomalies by adding a single @xmath541 pair , and assuming , for example , that only the higgs - like doublets @xmath383 and @xmath559 associated with the @xmath550 ( from @xmath537 ) and @xmath560 ( from @xmath539 ) remain in the observable sector .",
    "the @xmath383 is equivalent to the @xmath383 s from the other 27-plets , while the @xmath559 is similar to the @xmath555 multiplets , except that it has the opposite @xmath561 .",
    "the @xmath559 is not a candidate for the @xmath64 , because its @xmath561 would not allow the yukawa interactions in ( [ superpot ] ) needed to generate an effective @xmath2 ( an elementary @xmath2 is allowed by @xmath540 is this case ) or the effective yukawa interactions ( e.g. , generated by higher - dimension terms in the superpotential ) for the down - type quarks and electrons .",
    "thus , in this model the higgs multiplets ( or at least @xmath64 ) are not associated with the extra @xmath541 , although the latter are needed for gauge unification .",
    "this is not an ad hoc assumption , but a consequence of the allowed couplings ; the model actually has eight higgs - like doublets , 4 @xmath383 s , 3 @xmath555 s , and one @xmath559 . assuming positive soft mass squares at the planck scale",
    ", the only fields to actually acquire vevs will be those which have the necessary yukawa interactions in ( [ superpot ] ) and possibly ( [ superpotex ] ) , i.e. , an @xmath555 and @xmath383 pair ."
