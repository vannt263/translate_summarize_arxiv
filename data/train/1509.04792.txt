    "the isospin related pion - nucleon potential reduces the total pion production , but enhances the @xmath7 ratio , in particular in the domain of subthreshold energies .",
    "the transverse flows , invariant spectra , rapidity and transverse momentum distributions in heavy - ion collisions are promising observables in extracting the in - medium properties of pions in dense nuclear matter .",
    "experiments in the near future such as hirfl - csr ( lanzhou ) , riken - samurai in japan etc , are expected for extracting the high - density symmetry energy , pion - nucleon potential , in - medium properties of @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of etas , kaons , antikaons and hyperons in heavy - ion collisions is influenced by the in - medium potentials , in particular at the high - momentum tails .",
    "the transverse flow structure , invariant spectra , transverse mass spectra of @xmath196 , rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are related to the mean - field potentials , in particular in the domain of subthreshold energies .",
