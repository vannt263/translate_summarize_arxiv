    "when does a stochastic variable reach a preset threshold ( e.g. , a physical target or a given asset value ) for the first time ?",
    "this generic first passage time ( fpt ) problem @xcite is central to the kinetics across many disciplines , such as diffusion controlled chemical reactions @xcite , signalling cascades in biological cells @xcite , transport in disordered media @xcite including the breakthrough dynamics in hydrological aquifers @xcite , the location of food by foraging bacteria and animals @xcite , up to the global spreading of diseases @xcite or stock market dynamics @xcite .    despite their diverse phenomenology and owing to the central limit theorem ,",
    "the kinetics in stochastic systems such as the above can often be mapped onto a standard markovian random walk . here",
    "we will discuss the fpt behaviour in the context of a particle diffusing in space .",
    "in open domains the fpt statistics of the random walk  or its diffusion limit  decay as a power law , giving rise to a diverging mean fpt ( mfpt ) @xcite .",
    "heavy tails are common when it comes to persistence properties of infinite systems @xcite .",
    "a finite domain size , however , introduces an exponential long time decay and thus a finite mfpt , which becomes a function of the system size and dimensionality @xcite . in unbounded domains all first passage trajectories are nominally _ direct _ @xcite , whereas in confinement a particle can arrive at the target site also via reflection with the confining boundary , i.e. , via an _ indirect _ trajectory @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mfpt for non - recurrent and translation invariant markov dynamics is often strongly dominated by the long time behaviour  by _ indirect _ trajectories @xcite .",
    "this is the case when the volume of the domain tends to be very large and/or the target size tends to be very small @xcite . in such non - recurrent scenarios knowing the mfpt fully  yet non - trivially characterises the long time asymptotic of the fpt statistics @xcite . in non - recurrent systems with strongly broken translation invariance an additional time scale emerges , mirroring brief excursions away from the target @xcite .",
    "this intermediate time scale in turn significantly contributes to the mfpt @xcite .",
    "conversely , for recurrent motion the rate of the long time exponential decay is strongly affected by both , direct and indirect trajectories @xcite .",
    "often the dynamics additionally depend on some internal state , such as for example in the so - called intermittent search model , where the particle randomly switches between passive diffusion and active ballistic motion in a poissonian @xcite or lvy @xcite fashion , or equivalently in the facilitated diffusion model of gene regulation @xcite , where the particle switches between 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional diffusion , with an additional dynamical component due to conformational dynamics of dna @xcite , which in the annealed limit gives rise to lvy flights @xcite .",
    "a similar case is the transitioning between search and recognition modes in the 1-dimensional search of transcription factors along dna @xcite .",
    "a similar random transitioning occurs in stochastically gated chemical reactions @xcite and stochastically gated narrow escape @xcite .",
    "the markovian switching between the internal states introduces a much richer phenomenology and can lead to qualitative changes in the fpt statistics , such as in the case of the random search for a stochastically gated target @xcite .",
    "conversely , by combining recurrent and non - recurrent motion phases and thereby suppressing oversampling on large spatial scales and improving the hitting on small length - scales , one can improve stochastic search processes in the sense of minimising the mfpt to reach the target @xcite .    from a mathematical point of view all these compound processes",
    "are called _ markov additive _ ( ma ) @xcite .",
    "ma processes are a class of markov processes , whose state space @xmath0 is at least 2-dimensional and can be split into @xmath1 , a markovian component and an additive component @xmath2 , which is translation invariant @xcite .",
    "formally , some features of the fpt properties of ma processes with a general state space have already been addressed in the mathematical literature using algebraic methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . yet",
    ", explicit results on the fpt statistics for ma processes are sparse .",
    "moreover , the interplay between ( non)recurrent motion and markovian switching between internal states and its comparison to standard markov diffusion processes remains elusive .",
    "here we present rigorous results for the mfpt and fpt statistics for two - channel markov additive diffusion in a 3-dimensional spherical domain with the additive component @xmath2 being markovian .",
    "we consider a gated particle , that is , the particle can only recognise the target in one of the modes , which is shown to lead to non - trivial fpt behaviour .",
    "we also address the fpt problem of transitioning to an immobile phase .",
    "in particular , we prove that despite the perfectly non - recurrent motion of two - channel markov additive diffusion in 3 dimensions , the mfpt does not fully specify the asymptotic exponential decay of the fpt statistics as soon as none of the phases is static ( i.e. , has a vanishing diffusion coefficient ) , in contrast to the standard markovian counterpart .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we set up the model of two - channel ma as a mixed boundary value problem for two coupled forward fokker - planck equations .",
    "next , we summarise our main results on the mfpt and fpt statistics and discuss the implications of our results in a biophysical context . in the following sections we present detailed calculations , proofs and additional technicalities .",
    "as these contain essential mathematical approaches we include here all crucial steps of the derivation .",
    "finally , we give a concluding perspective and discuss possible extensions of the work .",

    "moreover , only the prefactor depends on the initial condition  the position as well as internal state , which suggests the statistics of direct trajectories , i.e. , those that reach the target without ever interacting with the boundary , controls the statistical weight of the exponential asymptotic , which is equivalent to the simpler markovian counterparts @xcite . to see this",
