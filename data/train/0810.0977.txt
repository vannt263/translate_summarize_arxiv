    "entangled multiqubit states are of central importance in the fields of quantum computation and quantum communication  @xcite , and have been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental investigations . as pointed out by schn _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the classes of all sequentially generated multiqubit states , assisted by an itinerant ancilla , are exactly given by the hierarchy of matrix - product states ( mpss )  @xcite .",
    "in this context , the required number of ancilla levels is determined by the dimension of the mps canonical representation of the target multiqubit state .",
    "matrix - product states play an important role in the context of strongly correlated systems  @xcite and describe the approximate ground states produced by density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and wilson s numerical renormalization group @xcite .",
    "paradigmatic multiqubit states , such as greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz )  @xcite , @xmath0  @xcite , and cluster  @xcite states , can be described by low - dimensional mps and are considered valuable resources for quantum information and communication tasks .",
    "the generation of multiqubit entangled states via a single global unitary operation acting on initially decoupled qubits is in general a difficult problem . from this point of view , several theoretical and experimental efforts have been oriented towards the sequential generation of paradigmatic entangled multipartite states . as a matter of fact , a number of sequential and global approaches have been implemented in different physical systems to produce specifically ghz  @xcite , @xmath0  @xcite , and cluster  @xcite states . in order to generate sequentially any multiqubit state , a wide range of ancilla levels and ancilla - qubit operations are necessary  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "two important theoretical and experimental questions appear naturally : will the sequential generation of a desired multiqubit state still be feasible under given restricted experimental conditions ? and",
    "if the answer is no , can we design an efficient protocol that tells us the best possible approximation to the sequential generation of such a state ? in this paper , we answer satisfactorily both questions .",
    "we demonstrate how the mps formalism allows us to exploit linear algebraic tools to study this relevant constrained optimization problem  @xcite .",
    "it is known that any @xmath1-qubit state @xmath2 can be written canonically as an mps with minimal dimension @xmath3",
    "it was also shown that such a state can be built sequentially with a @xmath4-dimensional ancilla , if we have access to arbitrary ancilla - qubit unitaries  @xcite . in the sequential generation of states , an ancillary system @xmath5 ( e.g. , a @xmath4-level atom ) couples sequentially to an initially decoupled qubit chain",

    "we are left with the @xmath1-qubit state  @xcite @xmath7}^{i_1 } |\\varphi_i\\rangle |i_n,\\dots , i_1\\rangle    \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an mps of bond dimension @xmath8 , where the @xmath9-dimensional matrix @xmath10}^{i_k}$ ] represents the ancilla - qubit operation at step @xmath11 of the sequential generation ( with isometry condition @xmath12 ) , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the initial and the final ancilla states , respectively .",
    "hence , a relevant experimental question may be raised : how well can we represent a given multiqubit state @xmath2 if only an ancilla with a smaller number of levels , @xmath15 , is available ?",
    "more formally : given a state @xmath2 , with a canonical mps representation of bond dimension @xmath4 , what is the optimal mps @xmath16 of lower bond dimension @xmath15 that minimizes their distance ?",
    "we want to estimate @xmath17 we propose two techniques to perform the mps approximation above , both exploiting a suitably designed local optimization of the @xmath18 matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mps_nqubit ] ) . in the first approach",
    ", we make use of a corollary of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) theorem from linear algebra to perform a local optimization procedure which may be called `` mps compression , '' in analogy to the image compression technique already used in computer science and engineering  @xcite .",
    "let the svd of matrix @xmath19 with @xmath20 be given by @xmath21 .",
    "then , the best possible lower - rank approximation to @xmath19 that minimizes the frobenius - norm distance @xmath22 is given by @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a _ truncation _ scheme in which one keeps only the @xmath24 largest singular values of @xmath19 to form the optimal lower - rank matrix @xmath25 .",
    "we exploit now this property , valid for a _ single _ matrix , and apply the outlined truncation to each matrix @xmath10}^{i_k}$ ] , @xmath26 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mps_nqubit ] ) , yielding an mps of lower bond dimension @xmath27 .",
    "this method offers a good solution for matrices with well - decaying singular - value spectrum .    in the second approach  @xcite , a dmrg - inspired variational optimization of @xmath18 matrices  @xcite",
    ", we seek the best possible approximation to @xmath2 in the space of all mps @xmath16 of the form  ( [ eq : mps_nqubit ] ) ( with @xmath28 ) with bond dimension @xmath15 , by solving the minimization problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mps_smaller_d ] ) under the constant - norm condition @xmath29 , which is implemented using a lagrange multiplier @xmath30 .",
    "varying eq .",

    "these equations can be solved very efficiently using a `` sweeping procedure '' in which one fixes all but the @xmath11th @xmath33-matrix and solves the corresponding eq .",
    "( [ eq : cloning_var ] ) for the matrix @xmath34}^{i_k}$ ] .",
    "then one moves on to the neighboring site and , in this fashion , sweeps back and forth through the chain until the convergence is reached .",

    "figure  [ mps_approx ] illustrates the two optimization schemes outlined above for two different states , both with @xmath35 , namely ( i ) the ground state of the @xmath36 heisenberg hamiltonian and ( ii ) a randomly chosen mps . for ( i ) , which has a well - decaying singular - value spectrum , the ancilla dimension can be effectively reduced from 16 to 6 .",
    "since variational optimization allows for the feedback of information by several sweeps , it generally performs better than mps compression .",
    "every open - boundary mps of form  ( [ eq : mps_nqubit ] ) ( with @xmath37 ) with _ arbitrary _ @xmath19 matrices , not necessarily isometries , can be cast into a canonical mps representation with minimal dimension @xmath4",
    "@xcite . such states , as mentioned above eq .  ( [ eq : mps_nqubit ] ) , can be generated sequentially  @xcite , such that the ancilla decouples unitarily in the last step .",
    "we note that the sequential generating isometries can be constructed explicitly by successive svd of the @xmath19 matrices and exploiting the gauge freedom of the matrix - product states as outlined in refs .",
    "this is a general recipe for the sequential generation of an  _ arbitrary _ entangled multiqubit state if the required ancilla dimension @xmath4 and ancilla - qubit unitaries are available .",
    "however , in general , a given physical setup may not have access to some of the required local ancilla - qubit unitaries .",
    "given such a limitation , we face an interesting constrained optimization problem : which is the sequential protocol by which a given multiqubit `` target '' state can be approximately generated with a maximal fidelity ?    to address this problem ,",
    "let us begin by considering the general unrestricted case : the unitary time evolution of the joint system ancilla - qubit at step @xmath11 of the sequential generation may be described by a general unitary @xmath38}^{\\a\\b}:\\h_\\a\\otimes\\h_\\b \\to \\h_\\a\\otimes\\h_\\b$ ] , @xmath38}^{\\a\\b}=e^{-ih_{[k]}^{\\a\\b } t/\\hbar}$ ] , where @xmath39}^{\\a\\b}$ ] is a general bipartite hamiltonian that _ couples _ the ancilla with the @xmath11th qubit .",

    "the ancilla can be set to decouple unitarily in the last step .",

    ", we have found strong numerical evidence that an _",

    "( [ eq : joint_psi ] ) [ based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : restricted_hamiltonian ] ) ] are augmented by arbitrary local unitaries for both ancilla and qubit spaces .",

    "[ opt_pat ] ) .",
    "we have considered , for this purpose , the generation of 100 randomly chosen mps and have found that @xmath87 remains below @xmath88 up to @xmath84 . note that the combined action of these unitaries includes ( at most ) 11 real independent parameters , which in practice can be reduced to ten , since varying a global phase has no effect .",
    "in contrast , the unrestricted unitaries @xmath89 involve 16 real independent parameters .",
    "thus sequential generation of an arbitrary mps with @xmath46 , can be achieved more economically than previously realized : a sufficient condition is the availability of the set of restricted two - qubit _ isometries _ specified above , instead of the availability of arbitrary two - qubit _ unitaries _  @xcite .",
    "we may then wonder whether some fixed parameter - free two - qubit isometries can act as universal set for generation of arbitrary entangled states .",
    "the problem we propose , which is the natural one in the sequential generation of multi - qubit states , is the following : give a minimal set @xmath90 of two - qubit unitaries such that one can generate an arbitrary isometry with a single unitary of the set @xmath90 , together with arbitrary one - qubit unitaries .",
    "note that , we already showed numerically that @xmath90 can be given by the single - parameter interactions of the @xmath51 type , whereas we now wonder whether this can be realized by a minimal set of fixed canonical gates .",
    "note that since the paradigm is completely different ( a single use of the entangling unitary and isometries instead of unitaries ) , the results concerning universal sets of gates for quantum computing do not play a role for our protocol .",
    "we have found numerically , for example , that some parameter - free fixed two - qubit gates [ such as controlled not ( cnot ) ] plus three local unitaries are not _ isometrically _ universal , as they are not capable of generating an arbitrary state with @xmath91 .",
    "the search for such two - qubit gates , if any , remains open .",
    "recently , a lot of effort has been devoted to find minimal sets of one - qubit and two - qubit gates , and the minimal number of applications , to generate arbitrary two - qubit _ unitaries _",
    "the existence of these universal sets is of central relevance in quantum computing .",
    "the above results suggest consideration of a class of problems involving a different paradigm : which are the universal sets of one - qubit and two - qubit gates that can generate arbitrary two - qubit _ isometries _ ?",
    "what is the minimal number of applications and how does this compare to the quantum computing case ?",
    "for the case of two - qubit unitaries , a universal gate set ( in the usual quantum computing sense ) is clearly sufficient , but not necessary .",
    "this results , for example , from counting the number of independent parameters for an arbitrary two - qubit unitary , clearly larger than in the case of an arbitrary two - qubit isometry . the aim will be then to find the exact decomposition of an arbitrary isometry into a minimal applications of unitaries as computational primitives .",
    "the general solution associated with this paradigm remains open .",
    "finally , we also want to point out that our scheme by construction can be clearly viewed also within the general framework of optimal control theory  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed protocols for an efficient sequential generation of entangled multiqubit states under realistic experimental constraints .",
    "we stress that the proposed optimization methods are of wide applicability and will be of importance for any sequential physical setup . in particular , we can mention photonic qubits , atoms , ions , superconducting qubits , or quantum dots .",
