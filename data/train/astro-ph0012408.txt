    "variability provides a powerful tool for constraining the physics of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the original models based on a central black hole surrounded by an accretion disk ( @xcite ) were based on the constraints on the source size and energy density provided by the early single - band variability studies .",
    "single - epoch multi - wavelength observations , covering simultaneously the range from radio to gamma - ray frequencies , are of crucial importance in suggesting the physical mechanisms responsible for the emission . however , in general they can not sufficiently constrain the large number of parameters involved in models . so far multi - wavelength monitoring , with adequate time sampling and duration , has been possible for a small number of low - redshift objects , thanks to large international collaborations ( see the review of @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "these observations provided further clues to and constraints on the radiation processes and reprocessing mechanisms , since changes of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) associated with flux variations can be interpreted in terms of an interplay of emission components of different spectral shape and variability properties .",
    "various classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show different variability properties .",
    "blazars show strong ( @xmath9 ) variations of the observed fluxes on time scales from days to months from radio to gamma frequencies , while in the optical - uv seyfert 1 and normal quasars ( qsos ) show smaller ( @xmath10 ) variability on time scales greater than a few months , although @xmath11 variations on time scales of days have been detected in x - rays in some seyfert galaxies ( mushotzki et al .",
    "1993 and refs . therein ) ( in the following we ignore the traditional distinction at @xmath12=-23 between seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos ) .",
    "the result of multi - frequency monitoring indicates that the optical - uv continuum of agns hardens during the bright phases ( @xcite ) in the near infrared - optical - uv range , while little or no correlation is thought to be present in bl lac objects(@xcite , see however @xcite ) .",
    "optical observations at faint magnitudes ( @xmath13 ) enable magnitude - limited statistical samples to be constructed ( mostly of radio - quiet objects ) in a single field of a large telescope , and repeated broad - band imaging provides light curves for each agn in the sample ( @xcite(t89 ) , @xcite(t94 ) , @xcite(btk98 ) ) allowing the ensemble variability properties of the sample to be assessed .",
    "studies of this kind are complicated by the fact that in all magnitude - limited samples the luminosity is strongly correlated with redshift ( l - z correlation ) , since the majority of objects lie close to the limiting flux .",
    "this makes it difficult to isolate the intrinsic variability - luminosity ( v - l ) and variability - redshift ( v - z ) correlations .    since early studies ,",
    "the relation between absolute optical luminosity and optical variability has been addressed by several authors ( @xcite ) , with the aim of discovering whether qsos are made up of multiple sources or single coherent sources . in the former case , a decrease of variability amplitude with luminosity",
    "is expected . in recent years",
    ", consensus has progressively grown that brighter qsos are less variable on average ( @xcite(t94),@xcite ) ( see @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "this would seem to support a model where the active nucleus is powered by a series of supernova explosions @xcite , though this model can fail to reproduce the variability amplitude in the case of most luminous qsos , according to @xcite .",
    "a similar negative correlation of x - ray variability with the 1 - 10 kev luminosity was found in seyfert galaxies and qsos and interpreted in terms of large number of incoherent flaring subunits by @xcite . on the contrary , a positive v - l correlation was found by @xcite for the blazar population .    concerning the l - z correlation ,",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the different variability indicators , used by different authors , are affected in different ways by the v - l and l - z correlation and by spurious redshift dependence due to the combination of time dilation , intrinsic variability time - scales , and total duration of the observational campaign .",
    "this led giallongo , trvese & vagnetti ( 1991 ) ( gtv ) to introduce a variability indicator based on the rest - frame structure function . adopting this indicator",
    ", they found a positive correlation of variability with redshift , taking properly into account the effect of v - l and l - z correlations .",
    "this result has been subsequently confirmed by the analysis of the qso structure function in bins of luminosity and redshift , performed by @xcite using all the statistical samples available at that time .",
    "gtv suggested that the v - z correlation can by explained by a hardening of the spectrum in the bright phases ( and vice versa ) , coupled with the increase of the rest - frame frequency with redshift , for a fixed observing band .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of the analysis of various qso samples , have shown that indeed , on average , variability increases with the rest - frame frequency .",
    "this provides an indirect statistical argument for a slope change of the quasar sed associated with luminosity variability",
    ". moreover the increase of variability with rest - frame frequency is quantitatively consistent with the v - z correlation .",
    "however , a direct statistical quantification of the change of spectral slope associated with luminosity variation is still missing . moreover , even though variability has historically played a key role in constraining models of the qso central engine , the physics of variability is still largely unknown .",
    "in fact , quite diverse variability mechanisms have been proposed , including supernovae explosions ( @xcite ) , instabilities in the accretion disk ( @xcite ) , and gravitational lensing due to intervening matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "discriminating between these different models on the sole basis of single band correlation functions and v - l and v - z correlations is a very difficult task .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze @xmath14 photometry of the faint qso sample of sa57 to look for direct evidence of an average spectral hardening for increasing flux .",
    "a statistical quantification of the spectral slope changes as a function of luminosity variations provides a new constraint for models of the variability mechanism .",
    "we also discuss the consistency of the sed variations with the v - z correlation and with temperature changes of an emitting black body .    this paper is organized as follows :",
    "data and reduction procedures are described in section 2 ; the statistical analysis of sed changes and their relation with flux variations are described in section 3 ; a concluding discussion is presented in section 4 .",
    "statistical studies of variability require a qso sample based on clearly known selection criteria , whose effects are clearly understood and quantifiable . among the existing qso samples , the magnitude - limited sample of faint qsos of selected area 57 ( @xcite(kkc ) ) is probably the most studied .",
    "this field has been repeatedly observed since 1974 with the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak in the photographic @xmath15 bands .",
    "different techniques , such as colors , lack of proper motion , and variability , have been applied to search for agns down to @xmath16 and to estimate the completeness of the sample .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of almost all of the qso candidates has been obtained ( @xcite(kkc),@xcite , t89,@xcite , t94 ) , with the exception of the faint part of the sample of extended sources of btk98 .",
    "this allows for the first time to perform a statistical analysis of the variability of the spectral energy distribution of qsos .",
    "single - band variability studies ( t89 , t94 , btk98 ) of the agn sample where based on the entire collection of j ( or @xmath1 ) plates . however , as discussed in the next section , the most reliable analysis of sed variability is obtained considering only `` simultaneous '' @xmath15 observations . for this reason we selected the two sets of plates taken in april 1984 and in april 1985",
    "the list of the plates is given in table 1 , which contains plate identification , the date , and the photometric band .",
    "the effective bandwidths of the @xmath15 bands are 570 , 1250 , 1150 , 1720    respectively and the effective wavelengths are 3540 , 4460 , 5980 , 7830 respectively .",
    "photometric methods and signal - to - noise ratio optimization are described in t89 , t94 and btk98 .",
    "the agn sample consists of 40 spectroscopically confirmed objects .",
    "table 2 gives the photometry on each of the 9 plates considered in the present analysis .",
    "of these 40 objects , 35 are the qsos discussed in t94 , while another 5 objects are the spectroscopically confirmed agns selected by btk as variable objects with extended images .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the sample is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath1 magnitude evaluated in a fixed aperture of radius @xmath19 ( but see btk98 for faint extended objects ) .",
    "the cumulative redshift distribution has 25% , 50% , and 75% of the objects below z=(0.75 , 1.16 , 1.80 ) respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the hubble diagram of the sample .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison of the @xmath20 fluxes at one epoch ( april 1984 ) , normalized at @xmath21   , as a function of the rest - frame frequency .",
    "most objects have similar spectral slopes , with five main exceptions , which are objects with a much steeper spectrum .",
    "two of them are low redshift and two are the highest redshift objects .",
    "the former two , n@xmath22 110195 with z=0.243 and n@xmath22 114264 with z=0.287 , belong to the sample of btk98 and are relatively faint agns , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "their r.m.s .",
    "variability is among the lowest in the sample of btk .",
    "since we know that , in general , fainter agns show a stronger variability , we may argue that in this case the light from the nucleus is diluted by the stellar light of the host galaxy .",
    "this could also explain the steep spectrum .",
    "if so , the spectral changes would also be affected by the presence of a constant stellar component .",
    "two other steep - spectrum objects are the most distant in the sample , n@xmath22 111610 with z=3.02 and n@xmath22 101392 with z=3.08 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ( bottom right in figure 2 ) .",
    "their spectral slopes are strongly affected by intergalactic ly-@xmath5 absorption .",
    "in particular the @xmath1 band falls in the ( rest - frame ) region between the emission ly-@xmath5 and the lyman - limit , and the @xmath0 band falls beyond the lyman - limit .",
    "the relevant fractional attenuation of the continuum can be evaluated as @xmath26 0.2 and and @xmath26 0.5 respectively , e.g. from @xcite .",
    "notice that , in figure 2 , the downwards shift of the f - band flux is due to the normalization at 2000    computed from the extrapolation of the steep uncorrected spectrum , and is dramatically reduced if the extrapolation to 2000      is done after the correction for the ly-@xmath5 absorption .",
    "once corrected for the absorption the two spectra become consistent with the average slope @xmath27 of the sample ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that the changes of the spectral index due to variability are independent of the intergalactic absorption , even though the apparent sed is affected .",
    "figure 3 shows , with arbitrary scale , the data reported in table 2 .    in the majority of the cases",
    "the deviations of the sed from a linear @xmath28 relation are small , but some objects have a local maximum of emission in the observed frequency range . of course",
    ", such a humped sed can be relevant for physical models of the emission mechanism .",
    "correlations of colors with other properties , e.g. the x - optical slope ( @xcite ) , can be affected by artificial curvature due to non - simultaneous measures of different bands .",
    "our aim is to correlate the sed changes with the brightness variations .",
    "we do this by correlating the variations @xmath4 of the spectral slope @xmath5 , defined by @xmath29 , with the variation of @xmath6 , where @xmath30 is the rest - frame frequency of one of the observing bands . in order to minimize the effect of noise , we are subject to several restrictions . on average the best signal - to - noise ratio is obtained on @xmath31 plates ; thus we use pairs of @xmath31 plates to compute @xmath32 .",
    "the noise in @xmath5 is lower for larger leverage on the @xmath33 axis and the larger the number of bands used .",
    "the data used for computing @xmath32 must not be used in the calculation of @xmath5 , otherwise a spurious correlation is found , namely @xmath4 and @xmath32 appear correlated even in the absence of variability , due to the presence of correlated noise in both @xmath4 and @xmath32 .",
    "this statistical bias may even lead to strong and highly significant correlation ( @xcite ) .",
    "it must be considered also that the sed can not be represented exactly by a power law in the wavelength range studied .",
    "this is not a problem as long as @xmath5 at different epochs is computed in a similar way .",
    "in fact @xmath5 is a linear combination of the values of @xmath34 measured in different bands , thus any deviation of the sed from a power law , while affecting @xmath5 , does not affect @xmath4 , which is a linear combination of @xmath32 values . this is true even when the deviation from the power law is produced by a ( non - variable ) absorption in some of the bands .",
    "however , computing @xmath5 in a very different way at two epochs , e.g. using @xmath0 and @xmath3 or @xmath31 and @xmath2 bands , can generate @xmath4 values not due to variability .",
    "this spurious @xmath4 can even be different for two identical qsos , if they have different redshifts .",
    "the above considerations led us to select the two - epoch set of plates described in table 1 , to minimize spurious effects and to increase the reliability and robustness of the results .",
    "we determined @xmath5 from a linear fit in the @xmath35 plane from @xmath15 data at the first epoch and from @xmath36 data at the second epoch ( the @xmath3 magnitude of n@xmath22 104855 is missing at the first epoch ) . in this way two more @xmath31 plates ( mpf3919 and mpf3977 ) , one at the first and one at the second epoch , are available to compute an independent @xmath37 .",
    "emission lines , which are known to vary on the same time scale of the continuum emission , may also affect the spectral slope variations . whether they cause a positive or negative contribution to the slope",
    "depends on the particular band and redshift . of course , if line variation were perfectly synchronous and proportional to continuum variation they would not cause any additional slope variability . a recent paper of @xcite , provides light curves of @xmath38 lines and continuum of 28 pg qsos with a sampling interval of 1 - 4 months for a total observing period of 7.5 years . from the line - continuum cross - correlation function",
    "the authors derive time delays of the order of 100 days for 17 of the 28 qsos .",
    "@xmath39 flux fluctuations are smaller than 20% of the continuum fluctuations .",
    "continuum and line variation are , in general , strongly correlated and the time width of the cross correlation function , which depends on the power spectrum of variability , is larger than the delay . as a result , in most cases the cross - correlation at zero time - lag is large ( @xmath40 ) so that line variations synchronous and proportional to the continuum variation can be considered a good approximation for the purpose of the present analysis .",
    "although we can not correlate the slope changes with flux variations for each individual object , we can study the `` ensemble average '' of spectral variations of the 40 objects of our sample between two epochs . in figure 4 , @xmath4 versus @xmath32 is reported for the entire sample , with the two linear regression lines , showing an average increase of the spectral slope @xmath5 for increasing @xmath41 , i.e. a hardening of the spectrum in the brighter phases .",
    "the distribution of @xmath4 s is symmetric about zero , indicating the absence of any strong systematic effect on the spectral slopes .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath4 and @xmath32 is @xmath42 and the probability of the null hypothesis is @xmath43 . we take the above result as statistical evidence for a relation of the type @xmath44 between @xmath5 and luminosity variations . to check the dependence of the result on the two most deviant points ( @xmath45=118122 @xmath46=-0.276 , and @xmath45=104885 @xmath46=0.292 ) we evaluated the correlation excluding in turn : i ) both the points , ii ) the first point and iii ) the second point .",
    "we obtained respectively : i ) @xmath47 @xmath48 , ii ) @xmath49 @xmath50 and iii ) @xmath51 @xmath52 . to determine the slope @xmath53 of the above relation ,",
    "the errors on @xmath4 and @xmath32 must be taken into account , especially if they differ on the two axes .",
    "errors on @xmath6 for the plate pairs of each band can be computed as follows . from the photometric catalog of the area of sky which has been monitored ( kkc , t89,t94,btk98 ) ,",
    "each containing 2540 objects brighter than @xmath1=22.5 , we computed @xmath32 for each object and for each band .",
    "then , in each band , we sorted the objects according to their magnitude , and for each object we took the 100 nearest neighbors ( in magnitude ) and computed the r.m.s .",
    "value @xmath54 of @xmath55 ( i=@xmath15 ) , after the exclusion of the points lying more than three standard deviations from the mean .",
    "as most of the objects in the field are non - variable we assume @xmath54 as a measure of the r.m.s .",
    "photometric noise on the flux differences @xmath56 .",
    "using the entire plate set , consisting of 5 , 15 , 5 , 6 plates in the @xmath15 bands respectively , it is also possible to derive a magnitude dependent photometric error for each plate ( instead of considering the error on the magnitude difference in plate pairs ) . as above we sorted the 2540 objects according to their @xmath1 magnitude ( on some reference plate ) , then for each object we considered the light curve , its time average and its mean square dispersion , in each band .",
    "then we took 100 neighboring objects in magnitude and computed the r.m.s .",
    "dispersions around the time average . neglecting the variance of the time average ,",
    "this provides an estimate of the r.m.s .",
    "photometric error of individual plates .",
    "the errors estimated from plate pairs are consistent with a quadratic combination of the errors of the relevant individual plates .",
    "these errors are shown for each point of figure 3 .",
    "the variance of @xmath4 is a linear combination of the variances of the signals in the bands involved , with appropriate coefficients depending on the frequencies of the bands .",
    "we can fit to the @xmath4,@xmath32 data a straight line taking into account the errors of individual points on both axes .",
    "the actual calculation is done using the `` fitexy '' subroutine from ( @xcite ) , which gives also the statistical uncertainties on @xmath57 and @xmath53 .",
    "the result , with one sigma errors , is @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "repeating the analysis with the exclusion of the n band reduces the effect of a deviation of the sed from a power low providing a less biased , but more noisy , estimate of the local spectral slope .",
    "the correlation is lower , but still positive and marginally significant ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the straight line fit to the data , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , is quite consistent with the previous result .",
    "@xcite found that the average increase of variability with redshift is @xmath63 .",
    "this quantity is related to the slope @xmath53 by : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation of the spectral slope and @xmath66 is the variability indicator defined in @xcite and @xmath67 is the r.m.s .",
    "flux density fluctuation .",
    "thus the value of @xmath53 found in the present analysis is consistent with the increase of variability with frequency found by @xcite and confirms the interpretation of the positive v - z correlation suggested by gtv , by a direct observation of the r.m.s . slope variability .",
    "we can compare our statistical results with the @xmath68 relation found by @xcite in individual objects through the analysis of iue observations .",
    "all of their 6 objects have low redshift and are sampled around a wavelength @xmath69    which is about the average wavelength of our sample ( @xmath70 ) . for 5 of their objects",
    "they find a significant correlation of @xmath5 and @xmath71 . for 4 of these objects",
    "the slope @xmath53 of the relation @xmath72 is around 1.7 , while 3c 273 shows a steeper ( @xmath73 ) relation .",
    "it would also be interesting to compare our findings with the variability of ( b - r ) colors measured by @xcite in a sample 42 of pg qsos .",
    "although the average redshift and the rest - frame wavelength region sampled , @xmath74 , @xmath75    differ from ours , qualitatively their results agree with ours , namely they also find a hardening of the spectrum during bright phases .",
    "a more detailed and quantitative comparison requires a re - analysis of @xcite data in a consistent way ( trevese & vagnetti , in preparation ; trevese & vagnetti 2000a , b ) .",
    "let us assume that the seds of the objects of our sample are typical of qsos , namely they are dominated by the big blue bump in the spectral region around @xmath21    ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we want to check the hypothesis that both the sed slope and brightness changes are caused by temperature changes of an emitting black body . for this purpose",
    "we use @xmath20 data only and we assign the slope @xmath5 to the intermediate frequency @xmath76 .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath5 versus @xmath77 for each object . in the same figure the curves @xmath78 , @xmath79 , of black bodies",
    "are also reported , for various values of the temperature t , h and k being the planck and the boltzmann constants .",
    "the two points marked with stars represent the uncorrected sed of the two highest redshift objects , which are affected by the intergalactic ly-@xmath5 absorption and appear particularly steep . since sa 57 is close to the galactic pole , interstellar reddening has a negligible effect on the location of points in figure 5 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 is skewed towards negative values , with most objects around -0.5 . to check the consistency of slope and brightness variation in a more stringent way",
    ", we exclude from the sample the most deviant points , with @xmath80 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding average temperature is @xmath82 .",
    "we can not compare @xmath83 with @xmath5 of individual objects because the noise is too large , especially on the former quantity .",
    "however we can compare the slope @xmath53 of the straight line fitting the points in figure 4 , representing the average increase of the spectral slope @xmath5 for increasing luminosity , with the corresponding relation expected for black body spectra of varying temperature .",
    "brightness and slope variations of the sed of a black body of fixed surface are related by @xmath84 \\equiv f_{bb}(x)$ ] . in figure 6 ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are plotted as functions of x. the value of @xmath87 and the r.m.s .",
    "spread @xmath88 of the sample define an interval of x in this plot .",
    "in the same figure is also reported the value of @xmath53 and @xmath89 as deduced from the statistical analysis of section 2 , which define a lower limit on x.    as seen from figure 6 , the above values define a non - empty region of consistency between @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the sample . a black body with @xmath90 satisfies simultaneously the two constraints .",
    "thus we can say that the @xmath4 and @xmath32 , observed at an average rest - frame @xmath91    are consistent with temperature variations of a typical black body of temperature @xmath82 .",
    "a single black - body spectrum is an oversimplified representation of the sed which , in the case of accretion disks models , ignores temperature gradients and the presence of other components necessary to explain the emission outside the frequency range considered . in any case",
    "we can say that :    \\i ) the increase of the amplitude of variability with the rest - frame frequency ( @xcite ) is due to the hardening in the bright phases ( and vice versa ) of the spectrum , which to a first approximation maintains its local power - law shape .",
    "\\ii ) the r.m.s .",
    "slope variations are quantitatively consistent with the increase of variability for increasing frequency found by @xcite .",
    "this confirms , by a direct observation of spectral slope changes , that correlation between the variability and redshift is accounted for by intrinsic spectral changes and does not require cosmological evolutionary effects .",
    "\\iii ) our results show that the average changes of the sed slope and the relevant flux variations in the optical - uv region are at least not inconsistent with temperature variations of a single emitting black body of @xmath92 .",
    "for instance , an optically thin plasma model ( @xcite ) requires a temperature of the order of @xmath93 to explain with a single emission component the sed from optical - uv to x - ray frequencies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung luminosity @xmath94 ( @xcite ) , can provide an optical - uv spectral slope @xmath5 consistent with the observations , but in this case the slope and brightness changes produced by temperature changes are related by @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 , for @xmath97 .",
    "thus , for @xmath98 , @xmath99 is not only too small in absolute value , but it is even negative , thus completely inconsistent with the result of our analysis .",
    "notice that also the temperature changes of a simple black body of @xmath100 would be inconsistent with our findings since , for @xmath101  , this temperature implies @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , at high temperature any thermal emission approaches the limit where the long - wavelength part has a fixed spectral slope , independent of temperature changes ( @xcite ) .",
    "any model trying to reproduce the observed sed from the ir to x - rays could be tested against the observed @xmath103 relation .",
    "in particular , it is possible to investigate whether the variation of one , or some , of the parameters involved ( like the temperature ) are capable of reproducing the observed relation .",
    "perhaps additional phenomena , e.g. hot spots or flares ( @xcite ) over an otherwise stationary accretion disk , are needed to explain the sed variability .",
    "the main limit of the present analysis are the small amplitude of variability , due to the short time interval ( 1 yr ) between the observations , and the lack of @xmath103 relation for individual objects , which could be different depending , e.g. , on their intrinsic luminosity .    despite these limits ,",
    "our results clearly show that a few additional multi - band observations , properly distributed in time , could provide strong constraints on the physics of emission and variability , especially if associated with simultaneous observations in the ir and x - rays .",
