    "the effects of defects on the properties of graphene are of scientific and practical importance  @xcite . for studying the effects of defects experimentally ,",
    "ion irradiation has been used , which introduces point defects in graphene .",
    "recently , in such an ion - irradiated graphene , the kondo effect is observed  @xcite .",
    "usually , the kondo effect indicates the presence of localized moments in the sample .",
    "therefore the above result suggests that a point defect in graphene causes a localized moment .",
    "the magnetic behavior of the defects in graphene is also observed in the recent magnetization measurement of ion - irradiated graphene  @xcite .    as a possible origin of this kondo effect , we proposed a localized moment on a @xmath3 orbital around the defect  @xcite .",
    "there are three @xmath3 orbitals around a point defect . with jahn - teller distortion ,",
    "two of them form a covalent bond and remaining one behaves as a localized moment with spin - half . furthermore , with this lattice distortion , there is a hybridization between the localized @xmath3 orbital and conduction @xmath4 electrons , and the kondo effect can occur . on this scenario",
    ", we introduced an effective model and analyzed it by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we showed that the experimentally observed gate voltage dependence of kondo temperature can be understood by assuming that the hybridization between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals is strong enough  @xcite .    in the above experiment ,",
    "the negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) , which is the evidence of the kondo effect , was also observed .",
    "although the characteristic magnetic field for this negative mr is found to be smaller by one order than the usual kondo - effect case , its origin has not been understood .",
    "so far , the studies on the effect of magnetic field on the kondo effect in graphene are limited , and there are few studies on the effect of zeeman field  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this negative mr , in this paper , we construct an effective model of graphene with a point defect and study the magnetic field effect on the thermodynamics of the model on the basis of the nrg method . here , as a first step , we consider only the zeeman field and neglect the orbital magnetic effect on the conduction electrons .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the graphene with a point defect has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the one - dimensional energy representation for the conduction electrons  @xcite which is necessary to apply the nrg method has been derived . in this representation ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are hamiltonians for the conduction electrons , the defect @xmath3 orbital , and the hybridization , respectively , with @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is an annihilation operator of the conduction electrons with energy @xmath11 and spin @xmath12 , @xmath13 , which satisfies the anti - commutation relation @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is the dirac delta function .",
    "@xmath16 is a cut - off energy that is the same order as the band width of the conduction electrons .",
    "@xmath17 is an annihilation operator of an electron on the defect @xmath3 orbital with spin @xmath12 , @xmath13 , which satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the chemical potential of electrons .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the energy level of the defect @xmath3 orbital measured from that of @xmath23 orbital on carbon atom , coulomb interaction , and zeeman field on the defect @xmath3 orbital , respectively .",
    "@xmath24 is the amplitude of the hybridization between conduction electrons and the @xmath3 orbital .",
    "this model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_hamiltonian])-([eq_hamiltonianhybridization ] ) is known as the single - channel pseudogap anderson model  @xcite , where the density of states ( dos ) of the conduction electron is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the kondo problem in this pseudogap system was studied in detail for the case with @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the main feature in this case is as follows . in the particle - hole symmetric ( @xmath28 )",
    "case , no kondo screening occurs , i.e. the localized moment is not screened by conduction electrons . on the other hand , in the particle - hole asymmetric ( @xmath29 ) case , the localized moment is screened when the coupling constant @xmath24 is larger than a critical value @xmath30 . in this paper",
    ", we assume the particle - hole asymmetry and study the case with @xmath31 and both @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "we apply the nrg method for the model ( [ eq_hamiltonian])-([eq_hamiltonianhybridization ] ) , following the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the electronic state at low temperatures .",
    "the nrg method can include the effects of the pseudogap dos , a finite chemical potential , and zeeman field . in the nrg method ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is transformed into the one - dimensional form with a chain length @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35,\\\\      h_0&=&\\lambda^{-1/2}\\bigg[\\sum_\\sigma\\epsilon_0c^\\dagger_{0\\sigma}c_{0\\sigma }      + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(h_{\\rm{def}}+h_{\\rm{hyb}})\\bigg],\\\\      h_{\\rm{hyb}}&=&vf\\sum_\\sigma\\left(c^\\dagger_{0\\sigma}d_\\sigma+{\\rm h.c.}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 is an annihilation operator of the conduction electrons on the @xmath37th site of the chain .",
    "@xmath38 is a logarithmic discretization parameter and @xmath39 . in the following , @xmath40",
    "is set to be @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the hopping parameter `` , and @xmath43 is the on - site potential '' , and @xmath44 is a factor .",
    "these parameters reflect the dos of the conduction electrons , and have numerical values of order of unity  @xcite .    by diagonalizing this hamiltonian iteratively @xmath33 times and by eliminating higher energy states",
    ", we obtain the energy eigenvalues and the eigenstates . here",
    "300 states are retained . by using these eigenvalues and eigenstates ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities are calculated  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the localized moment contributions to the entropy , @xmath45 , and the expectation value of square of the @xmath46 component of localized moment , @xmath47 , are calculated .",
    "orbital , @xmath45 , under the zeeman field @xmath48 at chemical potential @xmath26 for the hybridization @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . here ,",
    "boltzmann constant @xmath52 .",
    "inset shows @xmath53 at @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "( b ) temperature dependence of expectation value of @xmath1 , @xmath47 , for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=340][fig_thermodynamic ]    in order to clarify the low - temperature states of this model , we calculate the temperature dependence of @xmath53 and @xmath47 in the nrg method .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath21 are assumed to be @xmath57 @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xmath58 , and @xmath60 @xmath58 .",
    "thus we use the parameters @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , in the following . with these parameters , in the case of no zeeman field , @xmath63 , it has been shown  @xcite that the critical hybridization is @xmath64 . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the entropy of the defect is @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively at low temperatures .",
    "these three cases correspond to the local moment state , the valence - fluctuation fixed point , and the kondo - yosida singlet state , respectively . here , the boltzmann constant is set to be @xmath52",
    ".    figure 1(a ) shows @xmath53 as a function of temperature for the hybridization @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 under the zeeman field of @xmath48 at @xmath26 . for the case with @xmath49 and @xmath51 , @xmath70 at low temperatures",
    "however , their temperature dependences are different : at @xmath49 , for @xmath71 , @xmath53 changes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , it is suggested that the ground state is a spin polarized state . at @xmath74 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath45 changes from @xmath66 to @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "this temperature is much larger than the zeeman field ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , the ground state is considered to be the kondo - yosida singlet state . at a critical point @xmath54",
    ", we find that @xmath45 approaches @xmath72 at the lowest temperature as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "in order to obtain more information on the electronic states at low temperatures , we calculate @xmath47 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows @xmath47 as a function of temperature for the same parameters . for the case with @xmath49 and @xmath51",
    ", we find @xmath77 and @xmath67 , respectively at low temperature , which confirms the ground states suggested above : the spin polarized state for @xmath49 , and the kondo - yosida singlet state for @xmath74 .",
    "it is also found that @xmath47 suddenly changes from @xmath78 to @xmath67 at @xmath54 when we change @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is a critical value which separates the spin polarized state and the kondo - yosida singlet state . at @xmath80 , @xmath81 .    the critical value in the zeeman field , @xmath82 , is larger than the critical value @xmath30 at @xmath27 , because the kondo - yosida singlet state is suppressed by the zeeman field .",
    "we suppose that @xmath82 is determined by the relation @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a kondo temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath65 and @xmath85 at @xmath82 imply that there are two degenerate states at this point .",
    "we expect that these two states are up - spin state and empty ( unoccupied ) state , since @xmath85 can be interpreted as @xmath86/2 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the detail of this unusual fixed point will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we also calculate the finite chemical potential case , @xmath32 , under the zeeman field .",
    "@xmath45 is always zero at low temperatures . at low temperatures , @xmath47 ,",
    "shows the change from @xmath87 to @xmath67 , as @xmath24 increases .",
    "we do not find any unusual fixed point in this case .",
    "in summary , the effect of the zeeman field on the defect - induced kondo effect in graphene has been investigated .",
    "the effective model with the zeeman field has been derived and has been analyzed on the basis of numerical renormalization group method .",
    "it has been found that , at @xmath26 , there is an unusual fixed point with the entropy of @xmath0 and the expectation value of @xmath1 of @xmath2 at the border of the spin polarized state and the kondo - yosida singlet state .",
