    "detecting galaxies at high - redshift provides a powerful observational way to probe structure formation in the early universe .",
    "there have now been several hundreds of galaxies found using the lyman - break technique ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "although very successful , this method is limited to luminous objects .",
    "a complementary technique to select high - redshift galaxies is the detection of systems in absorption in the spectra of background quasars .",
    "since their selection is independent of luminosity and morphology , the study of galaxy evolution through these systems circumvents the biases inherent to traditional emission studies .",
    "+ damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( hereafter dlas ) have hydrogen column densities , log n(hi ) @xmath6 20.3 and are thought to be associated with parts of high - redshift galaxies , just as they are at lowest redshift @xcite . from our knowledge of the local universe",
    "we expect that high - redshift galaxies , especially those forming stars , should contain some amount of dust .",
    "therefore , the possibility that dlas are dusty objects is currently hotly debated . indeed , smoothed - particle hydrodynamic simulations @xcite predict that dlas should be 1/3@xmath8 solar at @xmath9 and even more metal - rich toward lower redshifts whilst current observations measure typically a metallicity around 1/10@xmath10 solar .",
    "dust is therefore invoked to reconcile results from the simulations with current observations .",
    "in addition , one can estimate the dust content of individual dla from the ratio of depleted onto undepleted elements it contains .",
    "it is assumed that a fraction of the elements is not detected in the gas phase because it is locked into dust grains ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "such studies have shown that the dust depletion levels observed in dlas are small , lower than those measured in the galactic interstellar - medium clouds with similar n(hi ) column densities .",
    "in fact , the observations resemble the dust depletion of the galactic halo warm gas @xcite .    another more direct way to probe the dust content of dlas is to look for a 2175   feature ( the so - called `` dust bump '' ) in the quasar spectrum .",
    "this feature is known to be more predominant in the milky way than in the small and large magellanic clouds .",
    "many searches lead to no - detections @xcite . using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra",
    ", @xcite claimed the detections of bumps in three individual mgii absorbers at z=1.5 , while @xcite have detected a clear bump in a dla at z=0.524 toward a bl lac at z=0.94 .",
    "other searches remained unsuccessful , indicating that most dlas do not show a predominant 2175   feature . a promising tool for finding the signatures of dust are searches for the strong silicate absorption features in the infrared .",
    "@xcite , using spitzer data , report on the first indication of 9.7 @xmath11 m silicate absorption in a dla at z@xmath12 , and find it to be stronger than expected from extrapolation of the relation from galactic diffuse ism .",
    "+ a consequence of dlas being dusty is that it might prevent the inclusion of their background quasar in colour - colour selected samples . in order to overcome such biases ,",
    "radio - selected quasar samples have been built recently : while @xcite did not discover a missing population , a more recent survey finds 4 fields ( out of @xmath260 ) where the radio - flux selected quasars have no optical counterparts down to very faint limits @xcite .",
    "these objects are the potential candidates of dusty dlas obscuring background quasars .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate yet another possible signature of the dust content of dlas . indeed , dust in a quasar absorber will redden the colour of its background quasar .",
    "@xcite were the first to look for reddening of the quasar continua in a sample containing dlas and detect reddening at 99.999% level .",
    "more recently , @xcite have used 79 dlas from sdss data release 2 to compare the slope of power laws fitting quasar continua with and without dlas .",
    "these authors found a colour excess due to small magellanic cloud type of dust of reddening @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 @xmath50.01 mag . using colour excess measurements for sdss sightlines containing dlas and matching sightlines without them , @xcite report a detection of reddening in a sample of dr5 sdss qsos towards sightlines containing dlas at the mean level of @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 @xmath26.3x10@xmath13 .",
    "they derive their estimate by comparing colours of qsos with intervening dlas to the mean colour of a set of qso of similar emission redshift and brightness , and bootstrapping the resulting broad distribution of colour excesses to ascertain the slightly redder colours of the dla qsos .",
    "a byproduct of the @xcite work , who performed a bayesian analysis on a variety of optical and radio datasets to determine the loss fraction of qsos due to dust obscuration , is an estimate of the probability density distribution for dust reddening in optical spectra , that also peaks around the same value for @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 . here , we build composite spectra of quasar spectra with dlas from sdss data releases 5 and 7 , and compare them with reference composite spectra built to match the original spectra in magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : after the introduction , we describe the selection of the dla samples in section 2 , followed by the construction of the matching non - absorber samples , and the procedure for obtaining composite spectra in section 3 , where we also presents the method for deriving extinction as well as the results for the full samples . after discussing subsample analyses ( section 4 ) , we summarise and conclude in section 5 .",
    "we start the selection of our samples from two lists of sdss surveys for dlas .",
    "@xcite searched in data release ( dr ) 5 , following a partially automated procedure tested on earlier data releases @xcite .",
    "their cleanest ( statistical ) sample contains 738 dlas .",
    "we have chosen not to include objects that are listed in their non - statistical sample , as these can be towards qsos with strong intrinsic absorption , or have z@xmath14 z@xmath15 .",
    "broad absorption line qso ( bals ) are known to be more strongly reddened in the rest - frame uv than non - bal qsos , and hence this list of dlas is then cross - correlated with the bal catalogue of @xcite , in order to avoid such bals entering our analysis . furthermore , we have restricted ourselves to those sightlines towards qsos in the @xcite sample that only exhibit one single dla .",
    "thus , we exclude the 59 respectively 5 cases , where two or three dlas are found along the same line of sight .",
    "this leaves us with a sample of 526 sdss dr5 qso sightlines with securely identified dla well suited for the analysis of their dust content .",
    "+ @xcite have surveyed dr7 , and present a list of 1426 strong hi absorbers at redshifts 2.15@xmath16 z @xmath16 5.2 , of which 937 systems have log n(hi @xmath17 20.3 . applying the same criteria for filtering out potentially problematic sightlines as above",
    ", we arrive at 731 sdss dr7 qso sightlines for this dla sample .",
    "while both lists have a substantial overlap ( 371 of prochaska s sources appear also in the noterdaeme list , albeit 31 of these are estimated there to fall below the log n(hi @xmath17 20.3 criterion ) , the two methods for finding dlas differ significantly enough to warrant keeping both datasets separate . it should , however , be kept in mind that the two samples are not independent from each other .",
    "note also that the sdss treatment of spectroscopic calibration has improved from dr5 to dr7 , especially the spectrophotometric algorithms .",
    "therefore , we have decided to strictly use only the versions of the spetra that have been processed by the dr7 pipeline .",
    "figure [ imag_and_zem ] shows the distribution of both samples in qso emission redshift and the @xmath3 band magnitudes .",
    "in addition , we show the underlying sdss qso lists ( cleaned of bals and the dlas from both lists , as detailed below ) from which we can draw our matching spectra . the insert shows the histogram of the absorber redshifts for the two samples .",
    "the vast majority ( @xmath18 ) of the dlas are in the redshift range @xmath22.2 @xmath16 z@xmath19 3.3 .",
    "there are a variety of different methods to derive estimates for the reddening of each qso spectrum , or the average reddening of the whole sample ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "we follow closely the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite , who have analysed the dust reddening in mgii absorbers towards sdss qsos .",
    "the basic principle is to define a sample of qsos , where for each dla quasar in question a close match in both emission redshift and @xmath3-band magnitude ( and hence absolute i - band magnitude ) is found , that does not contain a dla . as @xcite point out , this matched non - absorber qso spectrum will be of very similar data quality and hence sensitivity to similar levels of absorption at each wavelength , because of the regulation of exposure levels directly at the telescope and the exposure level check of all sdss spectra before they are admitted to the database .",
    "+ given that there is a dispersion in the spectral slopes of qso of similar magnitude and redshift , and hence a difficulty in matching spectra one by one , the strength of the method proposed here relies upon averaging over an as large as possible set of qsos with individually different slopes to obtain a robust measure of the ( geometric ) _ mean _ spectra for both the samples of qsos containing dlas and those free of dlas .",
    "sdss provides for both the largest homogeneous samples of dlas as well as the largest reservoir of qsos from which to draw comparison spectra .      to find an appropriate match for a dla - containing qso spectrum , we search the sdss dr5 database after cleaning it from bals and",
    "also the dlas found in both lists .",
    "this resulted in a pool of 8371 qsos with redshifts 2.24@xmath5z@xmath205.31 , from which to draw the comparison spectra .",
    "we minimise the difference of the match to the qso in the two - dimensional parameter space of the @xmath3 magnitude and emission redshift , defined as @xmath21 .",
    "note that we have corrected the @xmath3 magnitudes in each case for galactic reddening .",
    "the normalisation factors in the distance metric were chosen such that the number of outliers in both quantities are minimal , as detailed in the following paragraph .",
    "+ figure [ delta_z_delta_i ] shows the distribution of deviations between the dla containing spectra and their best matches in redshift and brightness for the two samples .",
    "the shape of the brightness distribution of the quasars in sdss within the redshift range probed here , introduces a systematic malmquist bias : in general there is a slightly higher chance to select a _ fainter _",
    "match at _ higher _ redshift .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced in the brightest dla qsos , because the number of potential counterparts below @xmath3 mag @xmath1618.0 becomes too low to select an adequate match .",
    "hence , we decided to exclude all dla sightlines from the following analyses that deviate more than 0.08 in @xmath3 mag and/or 0.007 in relative redshift difference ( dotted lines in the two panels of [ delta_z_delta_i ] ) .",
    "this reduces the dr5 sample to 475 , and the dr7 sample to 676 dlas .",
    "the mean @xmath22 band magnitude difference @xmath23(dla - match ) for these is -0.0029 , and -0.0022 mag , whereas the mean relative redshift differences are @xmath24(qso - match)/z = @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . + in principle , we could increase the number of matches for each dla spectrum to more than one counterpart .",
    "however , the gain in s / n ( or reduced scatter ) for the ratio of dla / match , dominated then by the dla composite s noise , which can not be reduced , does not compensate for the loss in matching precision : the more matches are being culled from the pool , the more severe the bias becomes . of special importance here",
    "are they increasing redshift differences that may distort the precision at which the composite match spectrum reproduces the shape of the hence , we have decided to utilise only the best match in each case .",
    "+          the redshift distribution for the dla systems in conjunction with the sdss spectral coverage ( 3800  @xmath27 ) allows in principle the construction of a composite spectrum in the dlas restframe from @xmath2 600  to @xmath2 3000  . obviously , however , the flux distribution of each qso blueward of 1215  in the quasar restframe is strongly suppressed due to the neutral h column densities sampled inside the forest , in a manner specific to each sightline differently . hence",
    ", in order to reliably determine the effects of dust reddening by comparison with an unreddened continuum , we have to restrict ourselves in each spectrum to the part redward of the beginning of the lyman forest .",
    "we have therefore chosen to exclude all pixels in a spectrum that lie below 1240  in the qso restframe .",
    "this introduces a cutoff in the restframe of the absorbers that varies from spectrum to spectrum individually depending on the combination of z@xmath4 and z@xmath28 . + geometric mean spectra",
    "were then generated from the absorber and non - absorber sample in the following manner : we extend the sdss wavelength grid with a stepsize of 0.001 in log @xmath29 to the lowest wavelengths covered by the spectra in the dla restframe , and , as specified above , redward of the lyman forest of the qso itself .",
    "for each wavelength data point @xmath30 in this grid we compute for each sightline separately which pixel in the original spectrum comes to lie closest when transforming by division through the absorber redshift , i.e. we take the nearest integer value of @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the wavelength of the first pixel in each spectrum , @xmath33 is the absorption redshift of the dla , and @xmath34 is the pixel number starting from the blue end of the spectrum . before computing the geometric mean of the flux distribution in the sample of the thus determined pixels , we clear it of those individual pixels flagged by the spectroscopic pipeline as possibly corrupted @xcite . we have made no attempt in masking additional pixels , e.g. at the location of known absorption at different redshifts than the dla .",
    "there is also no weighing of pixels according to e.g. s / n , as this possibly distorts the power - law nature of the combined spectrum .",
    "we have corrected the individual spectra for galactic reddening @xcite .",
    "the geometric mean composite spectra for the non - absorber sets were generated in exactly the same way , using the redshift of the corresponding dla in each case for equation [ pixel_number ] .",
    "note that we use in each case the spectra delivered by the dr7 pipeline , which includes the latest version of the spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "the advantage of the _ geometric _ mean is that it yields a meaningful average of the extinction at each wavelength by essentially averaging optical depths .",
    "+ note that our method does not rely upon any interpolation of the original spectra - at the price of sacrificing spectral resolution , because we bin together flux values that may reside in the dla restframe separated by 1/2 of a pixel at the extreme .",
    "we have tested the effects of this by comparison of the resulting composite spectra to two cases of a more refined treatment : i. rebinning each spectrum after deredshifting it , and ii . computing the weighted average of the flux values of the two pixels in the original spectra that always straddle one wavelength element in the new dla restframe grid .",
    "as expected , the differences over large wavelength ranges are negligible , and manifest themselves to a noticable degree only on a two to three pixel scale .",
    "hence , we believe our method , being as close as possible to the data , is robust enough not to have to rely on the intricacies of interpolation as in case i. because we have to throw out pixels with fluxes f@xmath35 0.0 , method ii from above results in having to flag out twice as many datapoints , which is therefore deemed less acceptable despite the higher spectral resolution .",
    "+        figure [ number_contributing ] shows the number of spectra contributing to each wavelength bin for the construction of the composite spectra in the dla restframe .",
    "it also highlights to which location in these spectra the observed central wavelength of the @xmath3 band ( 7481  ) is shifted in the dla frames .",
    "furthermore we have indicated the average brightness of the qsos contributing at each wavelength , and the average dla absorber redshift .",
    "note that the region covered by the bulk of the spectra extends from @xmath21400 to @xmath22300  , and exhibits fairly constant values of the mean brightness and absorber redshifts .",
    "the need for staying redward of the lyman @xmath0 emission , and the decreasing high ( restframe ) wavelength with increasing redshift of each qso , result of course in fewer spectra contributing to the composite towards the edges of the wavelength regime covered by our samples .",
    "hence , these spectral areas carry less weight due to their increased noise / scatter in the reddening analyses ( as detailed in 3.3 . ) . +              the geometric mean composite spectra of the 475 ( dr5 ) and 676 ( dr7 ) absorber spectra , and the corresponding non - absorbers are shown in the top panel of figures [ prochaska_spectrum ] and [ noterdaeme_spectrum ] .",
    "note how the qsos emission lines for both samples are equally smeared out due to the different shifts applied for each specific combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , whereas only for the dla sample the narrow absorption lines appear in the expected places . because of the lower numbers of spectra contributing to each wavelength bin towards the blue and red end of the composite , the noise ( or scatter ) starts to increase .",
    "the rise of the mean flux towards the red side is an effect of the qsos contributing to this part of the spectra being on average of lower redshift and brighter ( cf .",
    "figure [ imag_and_zem ] ) .",
    "additionally , the abrupt change in the flux beyond 2800  can be attributed to the stack becoming essentially the average of a very few spectra from this point on .",
    "+ the lower panels of figures [ prochaska_spectrum ] and [ noterdaeme_spectrum ] show the ratios of the two composite spectra .",
    "the cyan dotted line indicates the ratio expected assuming an extinction of @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.01 for an smc curve @xcite , and represents the upper limit on @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 derived by @xcite .",
    "it is immediately obvious that very little room is left for the signature of _ any _ dust extinction in the dla sample .",
    "we can quantitatively assess how much extinction can be tolerated by our data with the following procedure .",
    "+ suppose an unknown dla stacked spectrum , @xmath38 is reddened by dust within the absorbers , @xmath39 . then",
    ", the ratio of these two spectra would simply yield the extinction : @xmath40 .",
    "the underlying assumption for our method is that the stacked spectrum of the matches is a good representation of the unreddened dla stack .",
    "our matching scheme , however , leads us to an unreddened spectrum @xmath41 , that , by definition , has the same flux as the ( supposedly ) dust reddened dla spectrum at some fiducial wavelength @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the ratio of the two composites in this case is modified by the extinction @xmath43 at this matching wavelength @xmath44    given an extinction law , the ratio becomes a function of e(b - v ) only : @xmath45 . here",
    ", we have chosen the smc extinction curve of @xcite , and assume an @xmath46 as typical for the total - to - selective ratio .",
    "note that the choice of the smc reddening curve is the most constraining regarding the absence of dust signatures - lmc or even mw dust type induces stronger reddening .",
    "because we are fitting for the slope of this function , the potential offsets in @xmath43 are of no relevance in this circumstance , and hence the normalisation of the ratio curve is not important .",
    "+ figure [ chi2 ] shows the results of these one - parameter fits for dlas ( this work ) and two sdss samples of mgii absorbers @xcite . to obtain the latter two , we have applied exactly the same averaging scheme as outlined above . before the calculation of the goodness of fit statistic , @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 denotes the degrees of freedom for the fit ) ,",
    "we have taken out areas of @xmath75  from the known , narrow metal lines in the spectra .",
    "we find that we can constrain the amounts of extinction for those two samples of mgii absorbers very tightly : @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.012@xmath70.002 for the intervening , and @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.025@xmath70.003 for the associated cases .",
    "we therefore reproduce the results of @xcite and @xcite well , despite the fact that we do not explicitly also remove regions of the spectra that are affected by strong absorption at redshifts different from the mgii absorbers .",
    "we take this test as a sign that both our stacking algorithms and the method to estimate the reddening are robust and accurate for these mgii samples .",
    "we note , however , that the lower redshift of these absorbers ( compared to our samples of dlas ) may reduce the problem of the foreground reddening due to the lower redshift path sampled , and the intrinsically lower density of absorbers in the low - z universe .",
    "+ we have also applied this spectral method to the samples of dlas and pool qsos used by vladilo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for their photometric analysis .",
    "these authors have taken care to take out qsos that may be afflicted by absorption unrelated to the dlas .",
    "again , we are able to reproduce their results very well , and derive an @xmath49 , indicating that both methods yield similar results when applied to the same samples . here , the strength of our method is specifically that all the unrelated effects will affect both the dla and the pool spectra in the same way , and hence we choose to increase the sample size to ensure that these effects are averaged out .",
    "we are making use of both the largest databases for dlas _ and _ comparison spectra ( increasing the number of dlas by almost a factor of 3 for the dr7 sample , and the number of the objects in the comparison pool by a factor of 5 compared to the vladilo samples ) . + a word of caution is necessary when trying to quantify the confidence intervals for our results .",
    "nominally , the number of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) for the two samples are 2543 ( dr7 ) and 2583 ( dr7 ) , after taking out the pixels affected by metal - line absorption , and restricting ourselves to the wavelength region below 2500  to avoid the large drop in both numbers of spectra contributing and average qso brightness .",
    "however , as we have detailed in the section on the construction of the composite spectra , adjacent pixels are not truly independent of each other .",
    "we have tested the robustness of the fits by binning the composites ( with bin sizes up to 5 pixels , hence reducing the d.o.f . by the same factor ) .",
    "hence , we arrive at measurements of the mean @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = -0.0013@xmath7 0.0025 ( dr5 ) and @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = -0.0017@xmath70.0022 ( dr7 ) for the full samples , where the error budget adopts a generous 3@xmath50 level for the approach with the 5-pixel bin . + in order to test whether we could have detected an @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 distribution as predicted by @xcite and measured by @xcite , we have artificially reddened each dla quasar spectrum by a value drawn from a lognormal distribution of width 0.4 dex and mean of log @xmath51 , broadly consisted with those two studies .",
    "figure [ artificial_reddening ] shows that we not only could clearly detect such a reddening , but also could retrieve the input value very accurately ( red curve in figure [ chi2 ] ) . in fact , the two @xmath52 curves for our spectral analyses and the fake reddening are excluded by several @xmath50 .",
    "+ we have also performed a null test by comparing the composite spectra of the matched samples with composites created from the samples of the 2nd best , 3rd best , etc .... matching samples . as expected , the analysis of the ratios of these stacked spectra yields no detectable reddening , and the range of @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 values obtained by this procedure ranges from -0.002 @xmath16@xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 @xmath160.002 for dr5 , and -0.0018 @xmath16@xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 @xmath160.001 for dr7 .",
    "hence we encompass the two measurements with the dla samples .",
    "we note in passing that the main difficulty in matching the shape of the composites and their comparison counterparts lies in the strong emission lines of the qsos , especially blueward of @xmath21700  , where the fe - complexes have a profound influence on the flux above the continuum . indeed , when inspecting the ratio curves for the two samples , around that wavelength there seems to appear a kink in them , which may be caused by a mismatch in the emission lines .",
    "this is the main driver towards these ( very low ) negative @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 values we obtain formally from the fitting . if we restrict ourselves to either the ratios blueward or redward of this feature , the fitting results in exact null values ( at the expense of leverage in wavelength ) .",
    "+ one possible complication in matching the quasars luminosities based upon their emission redshifts and the observed i band magnitudes is that the latter could systematically underestimate the true continuum flux for the dla sample compared to their non - dla counterparts because of a higher fraction of strong metal absorption lines due to the presence of the dla .",
    "a rough estimate of the size of this effect indicates that in sightlines where a very strong absorber ( of the order of 5  restframe equivalent width ) is present in the i band , it will result in a photometric measurement that is decreased from the normal qso brightness by 2% .",
    "thus we may in such cases be selecting qsos as matches that are systematically too faint .",
    "we have tested whether such a possible bias may influence our analysis of the dust reddening signal by creating samples of matches following exactly the procedures described above , but introducing an artificial offset @xmath53 in the i band magnitude by minimising @xmath54 .",
    "even shifts as large as @xmath53=-0.2 magnitudes do not change the overall shape of the composite spectra , yielding almost exactly the same results for the reddening estimates when fitting for the slope of the ratio curves .",
    "while the full samples of dla sightlines do not show any appreciable sign of dust reddening to a high degree of accuracy , it is still possible that there are certain subsets of dlas and/or sightlines that do exhibit an amount of wavelength dependent extinction , which is simply too small to be detected when averaging over such large datasets . in order to check for such potential trends",
    ", we have divided the dla lists into subsamples according to various criteria concerning the dlas themselves ( namely absorption redshift , hi column density , and the ab- or presence of metal lines ) or the underlying qso sightlines ( apparent brightness or emission redshift ) . to keep a high enough number of dlas we have in almost all cases decided to simply split the full samples into two halves .",
    "+ figure [ subsample_nh ] shows the results of a split ( for the dr5 sample ) into the highest ( left panel ) and lowest ( right panel ) hi column densities for the dla .",
    "the mean of these subsamples are at log n@xmath55=20.91 , and log n@xmath55=20.42 . clearly , there is no difference in the fact that there is a null detection for both subsamples .",
    "+ figure [ subsample_zabs ] shows how differentiating the samples according to the absorber redshifts affects the dust reddening analysis .",
    "again , both for the low and the high redshift subsamples ( mean z@xmath28=2.63 , and 3.39 , respectively ) there is no reddening detectable .",
    "note how the higher redshift sample leads to a lower wavelength cut - off , and due to the generally fainter spectra a slightly higher noise in the composite .",
    "+ figure [ subsample_metals ] demonstrates that the dlas classified by @xcite as containing no visible narrow metal absorption lines in individual sdss spectra , do also not exhibit any such signs in their composite .",
    "only 88 of the 475 dlas fall into this class ( 18.5% ) , and hence the noise in the composite is much higher than in the other subsamples . yet , both classes do not show reddening .",
    "+ the separation into qsos of low and high redshifts ( shown in figure [ subsample_zem ] , mean z@xmath28=2.31 and 3.78 ) is similar to the cut in qso brightness ( mean @xmath3 band psf magnitude of @xmath3=18.62 , and 19.48 mag , corrected for galactic reddening ) , because of the trend for fainter sources with higher redshift .",
    "the subsample with the brightest qsos ( for dr5 ) is the only one that does show a positive value of the colour excess , but not signifcantly different from a null detection : @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.0012@xmath70.0025 . +",
    "to summarise , none of these simple subselections do give rise to the assumption that there are significant trends in reddening regarding either the observational constraints ( brightness and emission redshift of sources ) or dla properties ( absorption redshift , additional narrow metal line absorption , and hi column density ) .",
    "while our analysis technique reproduces well past results for other classes of absorbers at different redshifts @xcite , and dlas using other methods @xcite and @xcite where some extinction could be detected , we could no detect any significant extinction in samples of dlas drawn from the data releases 5 and 7 of the sdss .",
    "these findings are based on the largest dla sample ever studied , but also on the largest sample of quasars from which to draw a reference spectrum .",
    "the implication is that most of the dlas observed in sdss have a very small dust content .",
    "+ @xcite have analysed sdss spectra with intervening strong mgii absorbers , and detect clear dust reddening . more specifically , their subsamples with the highest mgii equivalent width ( subsamples 8 and 25 in their notation , table a4 ) show the highest degrees of reddening ( @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.032 and 0.085 ) .",
    "these strong mgii absorbers are then classified , based on the column densities of the accompanying metal lines , as akin to low redshift dlas .",
    "we note however , that a direct measurement of the hi absorption in these absorbers was not possible due to the low wavelength cutoff of sdss , and the mean hi column densities for the subsamples are derived by using an smc relationship between @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 and hi .",
    "@xcite also caution that not all high ew mgii absorbers are indeed dlas , although @xcite point out that the specific requirement of the qsos probed by @xcite with hst being uv - bright introduces a bias against red qsos , that may have lead them to an underestimate of the dla fraction .",
    "hence , it is a priori not clear whether our results contradict these findings .",
    "also note that there may be a redshift evolution effect .",
    "in fact , @xcite have noted that the rest - frame colour excess e(b - v ) for their mgii samples shows a strong decline with increasing redshift ( their figure 10 , lower right panel ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the difference in the mean redshifts of our samples ( z@xmath143.1 ) compared to the lower z@xmath141.4 of @xcite may partly explain the seemingly discrepant results .",
    "+ yet another strategy involving spectral analysis is fitting the qso continuum spectra by a power - law , and checking for deviations in the slope of these for spectra with and without dlas . employing this technique",
    ", @xcite can place an upper limit for a sample of 70 dlas from sdss dr2 of @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 = 0.01 .",
    "note that we can rule out such a high value for our samples with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "+ in addition , there have been claims of firm detections of dust reddening towards sightlines afflicted by intervening dlas .",
    "specifically , @xcite report a mean e(r - z)=27(@xmath79)x10@xmath13 for a subsample of the same dr5 dla sample that we use .",
    "when applying our method to these subsamples of dlas _ and _ the subsample of dr5 pool qsos for the constructing of the comparison spectrum , we recover their results .",
    "note that @xcite have removed all quasars from their samples that may have additional absorption unrelated to the dla , reducing the number of objects in each sample by a large fraction .",
    "we conclude that the differences do not reside in the methods , but the sample selection .",
    "we note that the reddening distribution of undesired interlopers probably has a tail with a small number of objects exhibiting much larger than the typical reddening expected from dla systems .",
    "it may hence be that for such low frequency events , that cases of e.g. bal qsos , despite efforts to filter them out , enter the dla samples more often than the comparison pool , and hence could wash out the signal .",
    "increasing the sample size reduces the possible impact of such special , very red qsos .",
    "our result is also at odds with expectations from the evolution of high - redshift galaxies ( but see @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised however that there are two separate issues : i ) what is the dust content of the quasar absorbers we know of today and ii ) which fraction of the quasar absorbers are missed because of the extinction they induce on their background quasar such that it is not selected in the first place .",
    "indeed , models of galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. @xcite predict the existence of regions of high metallicity and column density which are mostly not detected in current dla surveys @xcite .",
    "one way to reconcile these two findings is to invoke a dust - bias in the observations .",
    "these apparent discrepancies could indeed be explained by the dust content of the absorbers themselves : they could absorb enough light from the quasar to make the latter too faint to be included in current quasar samples , which barely go beyond magnitude g@xmath220.2 .",
    "in fact , an extension of the @xcite calculations taking into account recent observations addresses both these issues : @xcite propose that whilst the dust content of the dlas in current samples is not high , the missing fraction is possibly quite important ranging from 30% to 50% at @xmath56 .",
    "one way to to test such a hypothesis is to look at fainter objects than what can be probed with sdss .",
    "using a bayesian analysis of these issues in light of different techniques and datasets @xcite posit that probably less than 10% of dlas have been missed in current optical samples , and also derive an @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 posterior probability distribution peaking strongly around log @xmath5e(b - v)@xmath6 @xmath57 .",
    "+ on the other hand , if the absence of the detection of extinction in dlas is not due to an observational bias , then selecting in absorption implies that we are picking a population of high - redshift galaxies which have probably undergone little star formation , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that these system are gas - rich by construction .",
