    "recently , agt conjecture @xcite has launched extremely active investigations towards both 2d liouville cft and 4d @xmath3 @xmath4 scft or even generalization , say , higher rank of gauge groups @xcite , non - conformal ( asymptotically - free ) limit @xcite and @xmath5-deformation @xcite to name a few .",
    "now , it seems rather appropriate to consider not only proving ( or checking ) this conjecture but also why these two apparently irrelevant arenas should coincide with each other .    in this short article",
    ", we observe that the  uniformization problem \" pioneered by klein , koebe and poincar more than a century ago may shed illuminating light on answering this question .",
    "for instance , the stress - tensor @xmath6 showing up there turns out to provide the @xmath4 gaiotto ( rewritten seiberg - witten ) curve @xcite under certain proper limit , say , large intermediate @xmath7-channel momentum . consequently , agt conjecture strongly manifests itself as a full quantum uplift of the uniformization problem w.r.t .",
    "two equivariant parameters @xmath8 . in addition ,",
    "fuchsian type differential equations @xmath9 which are present during uniformizing punctured riemann surfaces are as well available through the ( semi)classical liouville limit @xmath10 ( or infinitely large central charge @xmath11 ) imposed onto the constraint for a null vector at the second level in verma module , i.e. @xmath12 as a matter of fact , this classical limit can get readily identified with the so - called nekrasov - shatashvili ( ns ) limit @xcite ( @xmath13 : string coupling ) @xmath14 which ultimately has something to do with many well - known integrable systems . performing the wkb method onto the equation satisfied by @xmath3 instanton partition functions with one surface operator inserted under ns limit , one is able to obtain either @xmath15 conformal blocks @xcite @xcite . see the definition around . ] or @xmath16 following agt who claimed a much more general relationship @xmath17 many publications @xcite have been devoted into this direction .    in summary ,",
    "the philosophy we are after is as follows . because every @xmath3 @xmath0-type scft is associated with some genus-@xmath18 @xmath19-punctured riemann surface @xmath20 @xcite , through uniformizing @xmath20 both a classical piece of liouville theory and an integrable ( fuchsian ) system will be further inferred .",
    "this viewpoint therefore renders us the clue for understanding why these two seemingly different arenas ultimately meet .",
    "based on these , we start off to consider a four - punctured riemann sphere @xmath21 over which a second - order heun equation is defined .",
    "obviously , it can be thought of as an extension of usual hypergeometric differential equations living on @xmath22 fixed by certain riemann scheme seiberg - witten theory in terms of gauss hypergeometric functions . ] .",
    ".riemann scheme in the presence of five regular singular points on @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 s are called characteristic exponents . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it then seems plausible that classical spheric five - point conformal blocks having one null vector @xmath25 insertion at the second level satisfy heun equations .",
    "we clarify this observation via a celebrated mathematical duality : heun can be suitably transformed into a two - body ( @xmath0-type ) elliptic calogero - moser ( ecm ) model .",
    "finally , in view of a marvelous limit bringing ecm to sutherland ( trigonometric calogero - sutherland ) model , we develop some correspondence between its excited wave functions and the toric diagram geometrically engineering @xmath26 theory .",
    "we organize this article as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explicitly re - derive the @xmath27 sw prepotential upon taking into account two approaches : hermitian matrix model and classical liouville theory .",
    "one may think of this presentation as another derivation other than the original agt proposal .",
    "this is because we have just relied on the ward identity of @xmath6 in the uniformization problem and arguments intrinsic to hermitian matrix models . in section 3 ,",
    "we proceed to review heun / ecm duality and study the relationship between toric and spheric conformal blocks ( elliptic / non - elliptic @xmath28 @xmath29 scfts ) .",
    "also , we find new insights into eigenstates of sutherland model from the toric diagram perspective . finally , a chart summarizing the main idea is pasted in section 4 .",
    "owing to klein , koebe and poincar , one is capable of uniformizing a punctured riemann surface by means of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "for instance , there exists uniquely a hyperbolic metric @xmath30 on an @xmath19-punctured riemann sphere @xmath31 which has the constant negative curvature @xmath32 and is obviously in the same conformal class as the flat space @xmath33 .",
    "one is as well able to think of as the pull - back from poincar s hyperbolic metric of a unit disc @xmath34 ( or upper half - plane @xmath35 ) is often @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the isometry group of @xmath38 , it is harmless to directly make use of the metric of @xmath38 in this manner .",
    "] , i.e. @xmath39 now , the requirement @xmath32 leads to the familiar liouville equation @xmath40 which is solved by @xmath41 , the stationary point of some liouville functional @xmath42 $ ] being clarified later .",
    "note that our conventions are listed below @xmath43 of course , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath41 around @xmath44 @xmath45 is readily read off according to the weight assigned to them . a guideline laid down by polyakov",

    "recall that the @xmath1-form of fuchsian equations looks like @xmath69 is fixed by both the number of regular singularities placed on @xmath70 and a prescribed riemann scheme . here",
    ", the multivaluedness of @xmath71 is accounted for due to its form being a ratio of two independent solutions to .",
    "also , the pair @xmath72 may get normalized to have a unit wronskian : @xmath73 which helps fix the conjugation acquired from @xmath74 . in view of",
    ", a type of riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem can be raised .",
    "namely , once monodromies of @xmath71 in @xmath75 are found explicitly , all @xmath61 s get known subsequently .",
    "this sounds like the usual rh problem only when the latter statement is replaced by ",
    "there exists certain algebraic curve whose period integrals reproduce @xmath72 \" .",
    "the stress - tensor @xmath6 thus obtained by computing schwarzian is a meromorphic function on @xmath23 : @xmath76 as before , its asymptotic behavior at infinity is supposed to be regular such that @xmath77 is able to impose three linear equations on @xmath61 s : @xmath78 as a remark , according to @xmath79 an equivalent description of this expression goes back precisely to if one equates @xmath80 with @xmath71 .",
    "let us illustrate more concretely what was announced around .",
    "that is , define @xmath81 at the level of bpz conformal blocks .",

    "note that the accessory parameter @xmath88 will be given in later on .        what comes as a classical counterpart of is @xmath109 = { \\cal s}^{(3)}(\\delta_4 , \\delta_3 , \\delta_s ) + { \\cal s}^{(3)}(\\delta_s , \\delta_2 , \\delta_1 ) -f_{\\delta_s,\\delta_i}(x ) -{f}_{\\delta_s , \\delta_i}(\\bar{x } ) .",

    "notice that @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the geodesic length of a ( hyperbolic ) four - punctured riemann sphere and encircles two punctures @xmath113 from other ones .      because the relationship amongst is entirely chiral and stems from the familiar ward identity about @xmath64 inserted at the level of conformal blocks , it is tempting to compare with what takes place in a hermitian matrix model possessing an usual vandermonde .",
    "that is , by means of kodaira - spencer field ( chiral free boson ) @xmath114 , the expectation value of the matrix model stress - tensor @xmath115 given by @xmath116 leads to the large-@xmath117 spectral curve .",
    "certainly , its ward identity bears a strong resemblance to but now @xmath96 has to be replaced by @xmath118 ( with possibly @xmath119 as @xmath120 ) .",
    "@xmath121 s are virasoro generators realized by @xmath114 possessing the central charge @xmath2 .",
    "we naturally anticipate that if the spectral curve @xmath122 is recognized as gaiotto curve ( rewritten seiberg - witten curve ) , @xmath123 of @xmath124 gets equivalent to the low - energy @xmath3 sw prepotential .",
    "the concrete form of @xmath124 has already been proposed by dijkgraaf and vafa @xcite last year ( see @xcite for further refinements ) .",
    "below , we will see that @xmath125 of turns out to give us the desired infra - red prepotential @xmath126 .",
    "another distinguished aspect we want to review involves a degenerate field @xmath127 entering the standard liouville theory . due to the null - vector decoupling equation at the second level @xmath128 , conformal blocks involving @xmath127 obey @xmath129 taking the ( semi)classical limit @xmath10 in ultimately recovers as done around section 2.1 . of course , a direct analogy can soon be seen in hermitian matrix models upon using the @xmath2 @xmath130 ; namely , the vev of a determinant operator @xmath131 has been known to solve the schrdinger - like equation stemming from the genus - zero spectral curve and meanwhile serves as the orthogonal polynomial for the matrix model . for example",
    ", may stand for @xmath132 ( hermite polynomial ) when @xmath124 is gaussian .",
    "let us proceed to work out some examples explicitly in which @xmath27 seiberg - witten prepotentials are recovered upon employing known classical 4pt - spheric conformal blocks . extracting sw prepotentials from classical conformal blocks may be viewed as another derivation more or less independent of the original agt proposal .",
    "this is because we have just taken advantage of both the ward identity of the stress - tensor intrinsic to the uniformization problem ( polyakov conjecture ) and arguments familiar in large-@xmath117 hermitian matrix models .    here",
    ", bare flavor masses and weights assigned to punctures are related by @xmath133 which descends directly from the so - called agt dictionary @xcite .",
    "besides , in @xcite teschner pointed out that is referred to as the  baxter equation \" and applying to it the wkb approximation at the zeroth - order ( much resembling ) gives @xmath134 notice that @xmath135 expressed in terms of a period integral of @xmath136 coincides with the @xmath4 coulomb phase parameter as claimed in @xcite . equipped with these , we first examine the case of four massless flavors .      in view of , under the large-@xmath99 limit implemented by @xmath10 , @xmath125 @xmath138 one",

    "we quote from @xcite the asymptotic expansion for generic @xmath150 and take both large @xmath98- and @xmath151-limit , i.e. @xmath152 in the second line by @xmath153 one recovers the instanton part of @xmath4 ( instead of @xmath154 ) sw prepotential . for instance",
    ", it becomes @xmath155 for @xmath156 which agrees to ( 3.48 ) of @xcite up to the @xmath157 part @xmath158 .",
    "certainly , in order to get higher - order corrections one finally has to appeal to the bpz representation of conformal blocks : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath5 are related by the celebrated elliptic @xmath161-function : @xmath162 with @xmath163 and @xmath164 being called half - period . by first executing zamolodchikov s recursive formula @xcite for @xmath165 and then taking @xmath166 inside ( without the intermediate @xmath53 procedure ) one is able to obtain to any desired order the @xmath27 sw prepotential .",
    "we have learned that dealing with uniformizing @xmath20 gets equivalent to studying fuchsian equations whose solutions involve conformal blocks within which at least one @xmath25 is inserted . a contact with well - known integrable systems ( heun , sutherland , etc . ) made by hopefully lays down opportunities for gaining insights into the corresponding @xmath167 @xmath4 scft and @xmath26 , a theory of four free hypermultiplets .",
    "first of all , the solution to heun equations must be interpreted as a spheric five - point conformal block @xmath168 is an abbreviation for an @xmath19-point conformal block . ] under @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently , by using heun / ecm duality this @xmath168 coincides with a toric @xmath169 which as well as @xmath168 involves one @xmath25 insertion .",
    "thereafter , we consider a limit taking ecm to sutherland model which corresponds to the operation of pinching a torus at one point .",
    "additionally , its eigenstates are examined by making use of toric diagrams engineering responsible @xmath26 systems .",
    "we quickly review calogero - moser / heun duality .",
    "recall that heun equation is of second - order : @xmath170 with the constraint @xmath171 .",
    "this differential equation is of fuchsian type , namely , all singularities @xmath172 have to be regular .",
    "it should be emphasized that any second - order differential equation with four regular singularities on @xmath23 falls into heun upon suitable transformations .",
    "due to @xmath173 the fundamental period of weierstrass function falls into @xmath174 , i.e. @xmath175 . a torus @xmath176 thus comes from @xmath23 owning branching points @xmath177 with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "also , by setting @xmath180 four branching points are brought to @xmath172 . moreover , through @xmath181 and @xmath182 heun equation is transformed into @xmath183 where parameters are related by @xmath184 note that transforming into is generally not unique . when @xmath185 @xmath186 , is called lam@xmath187 equation .      quite analogous to hypergeometric differential equations ,",
    "heun ones are designated to deal with four regular singularities placed on @xmath23 .",
    "based on previous discussions , @xmath188 having one @xmath25 insertion is naturally supposed to obey heun equations .",
    "we will show that this is true upon using the result of fateev , litvinov , neveu and onofri @xcite together with heun / ecm duality .    in @xcite @xmath168",
    "was written down as stands for @xmath189 . ]",
    "@xmath190 where @xmath191 notice that @xmath192 is jacobi theta function whilst @xmath193 denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . by @xmath53",
    "one observes that @xmath194 when @xmath195 , via the transformation technique advocated within ",
    ", one realizes that up to a prefactor @xmath196 does obey heun equation .",
    "remarkably , in @xcite it was shown that toric two - point conformal blocks under @xmath10 satisfies lam ( @xmath197 ) equation to which heun can reduce , i.e. @xmath198 upon performing the wkb method onto these schrdinger - like equations , one is capable of conjecturing the equivalence between spheric four - point and toric one - point bpz conformal blocks ( without @xmath25 ) under special momentum assignments just as argued around ( 3.29 ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "certainly , along the line of agt conjecture , relating these pure liouville stuffs to elliptic / non - elliptic @xmath3 @xmath29 scfts and studying their nekrasov instanton partition functions with surface operators inserted under ns limit analogous to @xcite remain good future issues .",
    "let us pause momentarily to consider how ecm can be brought to sutherland ( or trigonometric calogero - sutherland ) model .",
    "in fact , this is quite straightforward , i.e. given ecm hamiltonian @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the coupling constant and the fundamental periodicity of weierstrass @xmath201-function is @xmath202 , via @xmath203 or @xmath204 one obtains from @xmath205 @xmath206    in order to compute wave functions of @xmath207 we redefine it by means of the ground state @xmath208 @xmath209 as @xmath210 where @xmath211 comes from @xmath212 and @xmath213 reduces to simply an unitary vandermonde at @xmath214 .",
    "now , a well - known fact is that @xmath215 owns symmetric jack polynomials as its excited eigenstates ( @xmath216 : young tableaux ) @xmath217 which reduce to schur polynomials at @xmath214 . as pointed out in @xcite , a collective chiral boson description responsible for @xmath218 exists and its virasoro central charge",
    "is related to @xmath219 by @xmath220 .",
    "we will return to this aspect soon .      while a gauge - transformed @xmath207 in gets reduced to a two - body @xmath0-system , it is widely known that its eigenstates become gegenbauer polynomials : @xmath221 though @xmath222 has to be viewed as some @xmath223 as stressed , it nevertheless can stand for a @xmath224 ( 4d physical limit ) solution to being exact w.r.t .",
    "@xmath225 whenever @xmath219 in gets necessarily renormalized to , say , @xmath226 .",
    "this special value of @xmath225 will amount to facilitating our comparison with  unrefined \" information encoded in ordinary toric diagrams .    in the presence of @xmath227 in , we legally doubt whether it has something to do with the spheric @xmath228 having one @xmath25 insertion .",
    "usually , @xmath229 where @xmath230 henceforth , that arguments inside @xmath231 of @xmath222 are not all independent tells us that only two of three @xmath232 s are independent .",
    "still , note that @xmath233 makes the periodicity of @xmath234 even explicit .",
    "let us render a justification in the following paragraph",
    ".     brings one from calogero - moser to sutherland .",
    "note that weights of three punctures are not independent because only two parameters @xmath235 ( converted into @xmath236 @xmath4 coulomb branch parameter @xmath237 and adjoint hypermultiplet mass @xmath238 via agt dictionary ) are present.,width=453 ]    as shown around , we manage to think of as a toric @xmath239 having one @xmath25 insertion defined on a pinched torus as explained in figure [ fig : one ] . on the other hand , by adhering to @xcite , this kind of riemann surface can also correspond to the @xmath240 4d @xmath26 theory of four free hypermultiplets whose bare masses are evaluated by @xmath241 .",
    "however , because this @xmath242 is yielded via a degenerate limit of @xmath243 ( that is why a prime is added onto @xmath244 ) there must exist certain constraint between @xmath245 s .",
    "combined with and , one easily arrives at @xmath246 .",

    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , the asymptotic collective field describing the shape of @xmath2 fermi surface is fermionized to precisely schur polynomials defined by ( @xmath216 : young tableaux , @xmath288 : @xmath289-th row length ) string theory , imbimbo - mukhi type matrix model and schur polynomials . in particular , in @xcite @xmath290 half - bps correlators independent of yang - mills coupling constant @xmath291 are shown to coincide with @xmath2 tachyon scattering amplitudes to all genera .",

    "@xmath293 second , the undisturbed @xmath2 fermi liquid in the phase space is eventually mirrored to a two - punctured sphere as asserted in @xcite via the topological b - model language .",

    "<S> inspired by the work of alday , gaiotto and tachikawa ( agt ) , we saw the revival of poincar s uniformization problem and fuchsian equations obtained thereof .    </S>",
    "<S> three distinguished aspects are possessed by fuchsian equations . </S>",
    "<S> first , they are available via imposing a classical liouville limit on level - two null - vector conditions . </S>",
    "<S> second , they fall into some @xmath0-type integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> third , the stress - tensor present there ( in terms of the @xmath1-form ) manifests itself as a kind of one - dimensional  curve \" .    </S>",
    "<S> thereby , a contact with the recently proposed nekrasov - shatashvili limit was soon made on the one hand , whilst the seemingly mysterious derivation of seiberg - witten prepotentials from integrable models become resolved on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , agt conjecture can just be regarded as a quantum version of the previous poincar s approach .    </S>",
    "<S> equipped with these observations , we examined relations between spheric and toric ( classical ) conformal blocks via calogero - moser / heun duality . </S>",
    "<S> besides , as sutherland model is also obtainable from calogero - moser by pinching tori at one point , we tried to understand its eigenstates from the viewpoint of toric diagrams with possibly many surface operators ( toric branes ) inserted . a picture called  bubbling pants \" then emerged and reproduced well - known results of the non - critical self - dual @xmath2 string theory under a  blown - down \" limit .    </S>",
