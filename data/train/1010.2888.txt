    "the cover to be realized is @xmath329 with ( of course ) instructions @xmath330 .",
    "for @xmath301 the fundamental domain is the same used for ` 1 ` , and the reader can check that figure  [ 132:fig ] contains @xmath331 copies of @xmath302 giving @xmath332 with cone points at @xmath333 .            since , in a realization of the candidate , @xmath338 is covered by two non - singular points ( and four singular ones ) , of the @xmath218 copies of @xmath230 there must be @xmath85 around some @xmath311 and the other four around some @xmath313 .",
    "now @xmath339 is also covered by non - singular points , which implies that no edge @xmath340 is glued to the adjacent @xmath340 .",
    "in other words , each ( straight ) segment @xmath341 can be regarded as a single edge , and gets glued to another such segment . since @xmath342 is connected , the two blocks of @xmath85 copies of @xmath230 already described are glued together , forming a single block of @xmath218 copies of @xmath230 with @xmath77 free edges of type @xmath341 .",
    "but , to get a cone point of order @xmath77 , at some top or bottom @xmath343 , say @xmath314 , we must have a gluing as shown in the figure .",
    "we now abandon hyperbolically correct pictures and use combinatorial ones , but we keep track of geometry . to do this",
    "we note that the block of @xmath218 copies of @xmath230 , after performing the gluing shown , becomes a `` quadrangle '' ( because we can ignore the @xmath344 s ) with inner angles @xmath345 ( and an inner cone point of order @xmath77 , not shown in the picture ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ 23:fig ] , there are now three ways to pair the edges of this quadrangle by orientation - reversing maps .",
    "since we have already realized a cone point at @xmath314 of angle @xmath346 , these gluings give rise to a hyperbolic cone surface as follows :      neither of these is the desired @xmath342 , and the exceptionality of ` 23 ` is proved .",
    "we note however that if one disregards geometry the previous gluings do give rise of realizations of candidate branched covers of degree @xmath218 , but not of the desired one .",
    "namely :            as for ` 23 ` , using the fact that @xmath339 must be covered by non - singular points , we see we can forget @xmath339 , and redraw @xmath230 as a combinatorial triangle , but keeping track of its geometry by writing the angles at the vertices , with @xmath360 . since @xmath361 is covered by two non - singular points , one of order @xmath219 and three of order @xmath174 , the @xmath283 copies of @xmath230 can be grouped in two groups of @xmath174 copies giving the blocks @xmath362 with nine edges , 3 copies giving blocks @xmath363 with one edge , and 3 copies giving a block @xmath364 with three edges . note that at this stage all vertices should cover @xmath338 and they all have angle @xmath365 .",
    "we should now assemble the blocks so that at each glued vertex the total angle is @xmath366 , because all points covering @xmath338 are non - singular .",
    "this implies that gluing the edge of some @xmath367 to another edge @xmath368 of some block forces the two edges of the block adjacent to @xmath368 to be glued together .",
    "therefore , no @xmath367 is glued to @xmath364 , and ( up to change of notation ) @xmath369 and @xmath370 are glued to @xmath371 , while @xmath372 is glued to @xmath373 .",
    "this gives two new blocks @xmath374 and @xmath375 , with angles as shown , that we must now use with @xmath364 .",
    "the edge of @xmath375 whose ends have angle @xmath376 must be glued to an edge whose ends have angle @xmath377 , and two more gluings are then forced .",
    "this implies that the said edge of @xmath375 is not glued to @xmath364 , and there are two ways up to symmetry to glue it to an edge of @xmath374 .",
    "one of them gives a triangle with angles @xmath378 , and the other one a triangle with angles @xmath379 , which easily implies that the process can not be carried to the end .",
    "we must realize @xmath380 with @xmath381 .",
    "if @xmath305 are the cone points of orders @xmath325 , the fact that @xmath339 is covered by non - singular points implies as above that we can ignore it , then we must use @xmath382 copies of a triangle with vertices @xmath383 and angles @xmath384 .",
    "taking into account the way @xmath361 is covered we then get blocks @xmath385 for @xmath386 and @xmath367 for @xmath387 , as shown in figure  [ 146:fig ] , with @xmath388 , that we must assemble creating non - singular points only , that is , having angle @xmath389 .",
    "gluing @xmath367 to @xmath390 we get the blocks @xmath391 for @xmath387 , and we still have @xmath385 for @xmath387 .",
    "now we glue the two edges of @xmath391 separated by the vertex with angle @xmath392 to an edge of @xmath385 , getting the blocks @xmath393 for @xmath387 .",
    "we glue them in pairs as illustrated , getting two blocks @xmath394 for @xmath232 , that we can now glue together to finish the process .                    to conclude the proof of theorem  [ hyp : t(1)-to - s(3):summary : thm ] one would now need to show exceptionality of candidates ` 152 ` , ` 163 ` , ` 164 ` , ` 166 ` and ` 168 ` .",
    "we have actually done this using the criterion and the code  @xcite , as explained in section  [ techniques : sec ] .",
    "we will however show here the same fact in a geometric fashion for the smallest and for the largest candidates :      for ` 152 ` we should realize @xmath397 with ( of course ) @xmath398 . taking the cone orders @xmath399 at @xmath305",
    "we should then assemble @xmath163 copies of a triangle with vertices @xmath305 getting , after the gluing , vertices @xmath400 each adjacent to @xmath77 triangles .",
    "taking into account this property for @xmath401 we get the pattern first shown in figure  [ 152:fig ] , and taking into account also @xmath313 we get the two possible patterns also shown in the figure .",
    "these patterns do not give orbifolds , because in the first one the cone angle at @xmath314 is @xmath402 , and in the second one the cone angles at @xmath403 are @xmath404 .",
    "note however that combinatorially they give realization of candidate ` 151 ` and of the euclidean @xmath405 .    turning to ` 168 ` , we confine ourselves to a sketch , because the complete argument is long .",
    "we should realize @xmath406 gluing @xmath407 copies of @xmath408 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath4 is covered by smooth points and @xmath164 is covered by @xmath288 smooth points and one of order @xmath164 , we see that the triangles must get assembled into @xmath288 heptagons and one monogon , all with angles @xmath409 , with @xmath388 . for short ,",
    "let us write @xmath15 instead of @xmath410 .",
    "we should now glue these blocks getting angle @xmath77 at all vertices .",

    "this square can not glue to itself , so another heptagon gets replaced by one with angles @xmath412 ( in this order ) .",
    "checking various possibilities one sees that an edge incident to an angle @xmath85 of this heptagon can not be glued to an edge of the same heptagon , so , from the 3 original heptagons left , one gets replaced by a decagon with angles @xmath413 .",
