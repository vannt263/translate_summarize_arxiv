    "the basic evolution of low mass x ",
    "ray binaries above the ` bifurcation period ' @xcite has been often described ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the endpoint of this evolution is a wide system ( orbital period  from a few to hundreds of days ) containing a millisecond pulsar ( msp , the neutron star primary of initial mass m@xmath5 spun up by mass transfer from the secondary , of initial mass m@xmath6 ) and a low mass helium white dwarf , remnant helium core of the mass losing red giant .",
    "the simple relation connecting the giant stellar radius with the helium core mass of the star , which has a very slight dependence on the stellar mass and on the chemical composition , coupled with the kepler law , produces a relation between the final white dwarf mass  and the final , which has been often studied ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and compared with the  vs.  distribution of the more than 60 known msps .",
    "the sample of binary msp known up today shows a shortage of systems with orbital periods between 22 and 56 days .",
    "there have been two main attempts to explain this ` period gap ' . according to @xcite , the gap is related to the bifurcation period , which he assumes to be around 2 days .",
    "systems of secondary mass m@xmath7m@xmath8 , and beginning mass transfer just above 2 days period , should evolve to final @xmath960 days .",
    "if the secondary has an initial mass @xmath91.4 , the binary might evolve through a second common envelope phase , ending at p@xmath1020 days .",
    "@xcite revise this picture attributing the periods shorter than 20 days to early massive case b evolution .",
    "they question the idea that the bifurcation period is as large as 2 days ( to allow a minimum final period larger than 60 days ) , as evolution towards shorter periods for systems below ( but close to ) 2 days requires a very strong magnetic braking .",
    "@xcite then attribute the period gap to the small range of initial core masses involved ( 0.17 @xmath11 ) . in this latter scenario , a carbon oxygen white dwarf of mass larger than 0.35should be present at periods shorter than 20 days .",
    "notice that the two best determined masses are @xmath12 , at = 12.3d ( kaspi et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath13 , at = 5.741d @xcite , so the standard case b evolution produces at least some systems below 20d .",
    "we reconsider the evolution of the systems containing a neutron star and a giant of low initial mass .",
    "we only consider the systems in which the initial secondary mass is smaller than the primary mass , in the range @xmath14 , and assume population i composition ( metal mass fraction z=0.02 ) .    for a wide range of initial periods ,",
    "the systems suffer a phase of detachment , when the hydrogen burning shell reaches the point of deepest penetration of the convective envelope at the basis of the red giant branch @xcite . when the hydrogen content suddenly increases , there is a thermal readjustment of the shell physical conditions , with a decrease in the shell temperatures and , consequently , in the nuclear burning luminosity .",
    "thus the star contracts in order to adjust to the level of nuclear reactions in the shell .",
    "this phase is an important evolutionary tool in the single star evolution , as the radius contraction is associated to a drop in the luminosity along the red giant branch , producing a  bump \" in the luminosity function of simple stellar populations , which has been observed in many globular clusters @xcite .",
    "it has also been often identified in binary evolution @xcite , although never discussed in the context of the evolution leading to msp .",
    "we show that the bump related detachment of the system occurs for a good fraction of the evolutionary paths leading to long period binary msp , and consider the possible consequences for the orbital period evolution .",
    "although we do not follow explicitly the spin  up evolution of the accreting neutron star , we consider that , when the system resumes mass transfer , the ns is now a millisecond pulsar .",
    "therefore , mass accretion on the ns may be inhibited by the radio  ejection due to the pressure exerted by the msp radiation on the matter at the inner lagrangian point @xcite .",
    "this alters the binary evolution , as the mass is lost from the system carrying away a specific angular momentum ( am ) larger than the average .",
    "in fact , the am lost should be of the order of magnitude of the am of the donor , whose mass at this stage is only 0.40.5 , much smaller than the ns mass .",
    "we model parametrically the evolution in the phase of radioejection , and show that it naturally leads , in many cases , the final periods of systems away from the range 2060 days .",
    "we also show that , if the onset of radio  ejection is the mechanism which produces the period gap , this gap should not be found in population ii .",
    "unfortunately , the orbital period distribution in globular cluster seems to be altered by destruction mechanisms at long orbital periods , so that this hypothesis by now can not be tested . as a byproduct",
    ", we also show that the relation  vs.  obtained for population i in the framework of the computed models is consistent with the three best observational data .",
    "we build up our stellar models by the aton2.1 code , whose input physics is described in @xcite , while the binary evolution routines follow the description in @xcite .",
    "the code has been recently updated also including explicitly the evolution of the ns @xcite .",
    "models of 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 , with helium mass fraction y=0.28 and metallicity z=0.02 , were evolved as donors in binaries containing a ns companion of initial mass in the range 1.21.35 .",
    "the initial separation was chosen to allow mass transfer at different stages along the evolution .",
    "we do not discuss the previous evolution of these putative systems , that is the formation of the neutron star via the supernova ( sn ) ejection , and whether it is possible to obtain a neutron star in circular orbit with a low mass companion at the periods from which we begin considering the mass transfer .",
    "in particular , the common envelope phase preceding the sn event is likely to end with short orbital periods for low mass companions , and long period systems ( e.g. p@xmath15100d ) would be created mainly as a consequence of strong natal kicks ( see , e.g * ? ? ? * ) and have strong eccentricities .",
    "in addition to nuclear evolution , we assume that magnetic braking is active and describe it according to @xcite , with the _ f_parameter fixed at 0.5 .",
    "we also computed several evolutions of systems of m=0.9  and 1.1 , for y=0.24 and z=10@xmath16  to test the different behavior of population ii systems .",
    "table 1 reports some parameters for the binary evolutions starting from different initial models along the evolution of the 1.1  as single star , labeled by the model number n@xmath17 .",
    "smaller n@xmath17 thus correspond to earlier evolutionary stages .",
    "we computed  standard \" evolutions , which , at least during the first phase of mass transfer , neglect the possible role of the pulsar .",
    "a series of models ( labeled by  con \" in table 1 ) assume conservative mass transfer below the eddington limit .",
    "the matter exceeding the eddington limit was assumed to be lost from the system , carrying away the specific am ( j@xmath18 ) of the ns .",
    "we considered also evolutions , ( labeled by ",
    "eta \" ) in which only a fraction @xmath19  of the mass lost by the donor was transferred to the ns , and the remaining half was assumed to leave the system , carrying away the specific am j@xmath18 .",
    "we add several evolutions in which we start again from the bump  related detachment , and assume that all the mass lost from the donor is lost from the system , taking away a large fraction ( from 60% to 100% ) of the specific am j@xmath6 of the donor : this is the way in which we simulate an efficient onset of radio ejection , as this mechanism stops the matter at the inner lagrangian point .",
    "initial and final masses of the components and final periods are also reported in table 1 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the final vs.  relation for the population i evolutions of table 1 ( full squares on the left ) and for the additional population ii models ( full squares on the right ) , and compares them with the analytic approximations provided by @xcite and @xcite for population i and ii . our data compare well with the population ii relation by @xcite , but it is steeper than theirs at periods @xmath20days for population i. we notice that our population i results are in good agreement with the three observed data points displayed in the figure .",
    "these same systems , however , have quite small neutron star masses : the central values for psr j0437 - 4715 @xcite and b1855 + 09 @xcite are only 1.551.60 , with upper limits at @xmath211.71.75 . in addition , the mass of psr j1713 + 0747 ( splaver et al . 2005 ) , at a period of 68d ( close to our evolutions",
    "5 ) is only 1.3@xmath22 .",
    "this value is three @xmath23  smaller than our predicted mass of @xmath24  from sequence 5con , while sequence 5eta provides a much more comfortable value of 1.655 , as we have assumed the loss of half of the mass lost from the donor , and , in addition , the initial mass of the ns is taken to be only 1.25 , contrary to the commonplace assumption of a starting value of 1.35 - 1.40  often adopted in the literature .",
    "notice that the recent accurate mass determination of the relativistic double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) provides 1.25  for the lighter component . to maintain small masses for the pulsar component",
    ", we could also have reduced the companion mass down to 1 .",
    "when , on the contrary the initial mass of the donor is somewhat larger than 1.1 , the first phases will occur at mass transfer rates much larger than eddington limit , and the additional initial mass will easily be lost from the system . of course , there is no adequate physical reason to assume the semi  conservative evolution we adopt , but a careful exploration of the parameter space is beyond the purpose of the present work and the results are not affected sensibly by the precise choices .",
    "this is shown in fig [ fig2 ] , which compares the mass loss rate versus period evolution in cases 5con and 5eta . in this standard cases , after the super eddington inital phase of mass loss , a stationary phase begins , interrupted by the bump  induced detachment , after which mass loss resumes and follows the same rules .",
    "the difference between the conservative and non conservative evolution is not very important , due to the fact that we assume that the specific am loss associated with the mass loss is that of the primary neutron star , much smaller than the average am for most of the evolution .",
    "the non conservative case , however , allows us to obtain in the end small neutron star masses ( 1.61.7 ) much more compatible with the neutron star masses in the systems we are examining .",
    "the conservative evolution leads to masses 1.92.1 .",
    "our following discussion depends on the orbital evolution and not on the assumption of mass conservation , as long as we assume am is lost from the neutron star .",
    "fig . [ fig3 ] shows the hr diagram of the donor star 1.1for z=0.02 .",
    "the evolutionary track without mass loss is shown as a reference .",
    "the location of the bump is seen in the thickening of the track , at @xmath25 .",
    "it corresponds to a stage at which the core mass is @xmath26 .",
    "we see that a bump signature is present in all the evolutions where mass loss begins at evolutionary phases at which the hydrogen burning shell has not yet reached the discontinuity in hydrogen left by convection .    at the bump  related detachment , in all cases",
    ", the ns has been accelerated by the first phase of mass transfer .",
    "we assume that the maximum spin achieved is the observed minimum spin period @xmath27ms . during the semi",
    "detached evolution , the total mass decreases , while the hydrogen shell advances and the h - exhausted core increases in mass , until it will encounter the discontinuity .",
    "of course the earlier is the phase at which mass loss starts , the smaller is the total mass at the time of detachment .",
    "when the mass loss rate is resumed , it is much larger if we assume that , thanks to an efficient radio  ejection , the matter lost from the system carries away a large fraction of the specific am of the donor . figure [ fig4 ] shows the different evolutions obtained in cases 4re .",
    "the larger is the fraction of specific am lost , the larger is the mass loss rate , and the shorter is the final .",
    "we see that the standard evolution would lead to a final period of @xmath2136 days , in the middle of the period gap .",
    "but if radio ejection is efficient the period is reduced below 22 days for a fraction between 60% and 80%@xmath28 of am loss , corresponding to a mass transfer rate of @xmath29/yr .",
    "we must then understand when and where the mass transfer rates obtained are compatible with the assumption of radio  ejection .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the mass transfer rates for cases 3 , 4 and 5 , and compares the standard evolution with the evolutions assuming that 80% of the donor am is lost starting after the bump  related detachment .",
    "contrary to the case discussed above , the evolution of case 5 leads to a final period in the middle of the gap ( @xmath2128d ) if there is an efficient radio - ejection , corresponding to a mass loss rate of 2@xmath30/yr , otherwise the final period is @xmath2161d , at the upper end of the period gap .",
    "which are the constraints on the pulsar magnetic field which allow an efficient radio  ejection in case 4 and non efficient in case 5 ?",
    "we assume that the maximum spin frequency attainable by the msp is @xmath21750hz @xcite ( corresponding to a minimum period of @xmath211.3ms ) .",
    "following burderi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we remember that radio  ejection can occur for orbital periods longer than the critical period : +   + @xmath31^{-3/2 }   \\times \\nonumber \\\\   ( m+m_2)^{-1/2 } \\;\\ ; { \\rm h }   &   &   \\label{eq : pcrit } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the shakura  sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath33  is the magnetic moment of the neutron star in units of 10@xmath34gauss @xmath3 ( corresponding to a surface magnetic field of @xmath35gauss ) , p@xmath36  is the spin period of the neutron star in milliseconds , @xmath37 for a gas with solar abundances ( where @xmath38 is the mean particle mass in units of the proton mass @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath41/yr .",
    "this critical period has been derived equating the pressure of a shakura - sunyaev accretion disc ( approximately proportional to @xmath42 ) with the radiation pressure exerted by the magneto - dipole rotator ( proportional to @xmath43 ) .",
    "this gives a radius beyond which radiation pressure always dominates over disk pressure , causing the ejection of matter of the disc .",
    "equating this radius with the distance between the ns and the inner lagrangian point , which we approximate with the difference between the orbital separation and the roche lobe radius of the secondary ( which depends on the binary period ) , and solving for the orbital period gives a critical period beyond which accretion is always inhibited by the action of the pulsar pressure .",
    "we can invert equation 1 to obtain the value of the critical magnetic momentum as a function of the critical orbital period : we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 , a value close to 1 , and @xmath46 . assuming that the nss have been accelerated to the minimum observed spin period @xmath47ms , inserting the appropriate values for the masses ( see table 1 ) , and assuming that the orbital period at the bump is the critical period",
    ", we can derive a constraint on the magnetic moment of the ns .",
    "namely , if we wish that the sequence 4 experiences radio  ejection ( to reduce its final period below 22d ) while sequence 5 does not ( to avoid a final period into the gap ) , we must impose :    @xmath48    for those systems whose initial binary parameters would lead them into the period gap . in this interpretation ,",
    "the gap is only a statistical gap , and not a forbidden region .",
    "therefore , we can predict that systems with  into the gap can exist , but they should preferentially have magnetic moments out of the interval given in eq.[eq : two ] . fig .",
    "[ figdata ] reports the orbital periods vs. the magnetic moments for all the known binary msps in the galactic field ( as derived from version 1.32 of the atnf pulsar catalog , and from stairs et al .",
    "2005 ) having spin period shorter than 10 ms , @xmath49 d , nearly circular orbit ( eccentricity smaller than 10@xmath16 ) and supposedly white dwarf companion of mass @xmath50 m@xmath51 the aforementioned parameters are the typical outcomes of the standard nuclear evolution of low mass x - ray binary , which is in the focus of this paper ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it appears that about 75% of the sample displays magnetic moments within the range of equation [ eq : two ] or very close to its limits .",
    "the evolution of the three systems at @xmath2113 days might have been influenced by radio ejection , and the two systems at @xmath2156 days could have been found in the gap , if their magnetic moments had been larger .    the proposed scenario is finally summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , reporting the evolution in the plane  vs. white dwarf mass .",
    "we see that , taking into account the ns evolution and the process of radio  ejection leads to a natural explanation of the period gap",
    ". a population synthesis may give further support to this picture , allowing to precisely calculate the effect of the interplay between the various parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq : pcrit ] on the  vs @xmath52 distribution .",
    "the result we have found derives from three main occurrences : 1 ) the maximum extension of the convective envelope in population i reaches down to an inner mass point of @xmath210.24 , so that the bump induced detachment occurs when the hydrogen exhausted core mass reaches about 0.22 , at a period well below 20 days for the systems in which we have tested that the radio  ejection mechanism can work . in population ii ,",
    "the maximum extent of convection only reaches @xmath210.35 .",
    "thus any bump related detachment would occur at a much longer longer orbital period , when the core reaches @xmath53 and the red giant has already transfered a large amount of its envelope . therefore , even if radio  ejection begins to dominate , it can not affect in an interesting way the binary final period . in any case",
    ", no period gap can occur due to this mechanism , for periods shorter than @xmath2135 days .",
    "unfortunately , the globular cluster period distribution @xcite does indicate that it is affected by the dynamic encounters in the dense stellar environment .",
    "in particular , systems with period larger than 10 days are so few that we can not falsify our hypothesis by now .",
    "we follow the evolution of the mass losing component in systems progenitors of binaries containing a msp and a remnant white dwarf companion .",
    "when the mass transfer begins during the red giant branch phase , in many cases the binary evolution shows a period of detachment , due to the shrinking of the stellar radius which occurs when the hydrogen burning shell meets with the hydrogen discontinuity left at the time of the maximum extension of the convective envelope . when the mass transfer resumes , it is possible that the evolution suffers a radio  ejection phase which alters the final orbital parameters , due to the loss of mass and am from the system .",
    "we show that the period gap between 22 and 56 days in the distribution of binary msps is produced if the magnetic momentum of the neutron star is in the range @xmath54g@xmath3 , typical of msps .",
    "a population synthesis study could strengthen the conclusion that this period gap is `` bump  related '' , but there are many parameters to be considered in the analysis",
    ". a better test of the model would be if new systems are found into the period gap , and their magnetic moments are either below @xmath55g@xmath3 , or above @xmath4g@xmath3 .",
