    "recent experimental and theoretical studies of ferromagnet / superconductor ( f / s ) heterostructures have revealed a rich physics of magnetic and transport properties of these systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "a considerable amount of attention in these studies has been devoted to the effect of ferromagnetic domain structure on the critical temperature of superconductivity nucleation ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this effect originates from both the exchange and electromagnetic ( orbital ) mechanisms of interaction between superconducting and magnetic orderings .",
    "the electromagnetic mechanism appears to be a dominant one for the experimental works which investigate f / s bilayers designed to suppress the proximity effect ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the non - uniform magnetic stray field of domain walls can result in the formation of a localized cooper pair wave function at temperatures exceeding the superconducting critical temperature in the bulk .",
    "such localized order parameter ( op ) distributions and corresponding phase diagrams have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite for a generic case of a step - like profile of a stray magnetic field in a superconducting thin film . at a fixed temperature @xmath0 for a certain critical amplitude @xmath1 [ @xmath2 of a step  like magnetic stray field profile the structure of localized op wave function coincides with the one which formes in the vicinity of superconductor / vacuum or superconductor / insulator flat interface in a parallel field equal to @xmath1 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the critical fields of bulk superconductivity and surface superconductivity , respectively  @xcite .",
    "certainly , in a restricted sample geometry the localized op wave function should appear not only near the domain walls but also at the film edges .",
    "thus , for temperature values @xmath0 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , defined by the conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , there appears a set of localized superconducting modes propagating along the sample edges and/or domain walls and decaying in the transverse direction .",
    "hereafter these localized modes will be called superconducting channels .",
    "one can pose a natural question whether the superconducting critical temperature @xmath9 could be increased due to the overlapping of the op modes localized near the various types of superconducting channels",
    ". indeed , such increase in the @xmath9 value is well known to occur for two parallel superconductor / vacuum interfaces ( i.e. for a superconducting film ) placed in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath10 parallel to the interfaces ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the critical temperature in this system monotonously increases with the film thickness decreasing and saturates at the @xmath11 value in the limit of small thicknesses . taking non - parallel boundaries",
    "we get a superconducting wedge placed in a magnetic field .",
    "the squeezing of the superconducting wave function at a small wedge angle is known to cause a strong increase in the critical temperature @xmath9 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is the goal of our work to analyze the effect of such wave function squeezing on the critical temperature enhancement for various types of crossing superconducting channels localized near the sample edges and/or domain walls . within the linearized ginzburg  landau model we carried out the calculations of the critical temperature of localized superconductivity for a simple hybrid system consisting of a thin superconducting film placed in a non - uniform stray magnetic field of straight domain boundaries in a ferromagnetic substrate underneath .",
    "an origin of the critical temperature enhancement can be clearly demonstrated for a generic example of parallel boundaries . generalizing the textbook solution for the critical field of a thin superconducting film we consider two model problems : ( i ) parallel domain boundary and sample boundary separated by the distance @xmath12 ; ( ii ) two parallel domain boundaries at the separation @xmath12 . in both cases",
    "the dependence of critical temperature @xmath9 vs the distance @xmath12 reveals a maximum at the value of the order of the magnetic length @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a planck constant , @xmath15 is an electron charge . at this distance",
    "the wave functions of the op modes localized near neighboring domain walls or near the domain wall and the sample edge merge and form a single superconducting channel .",
    "turning now to the case of non  parallel domain walls ( which cross at the angle @xmath16 ) or a domain wall crossing a sample boundary at a certain small angle @xmath17 one can expect that the most favorable conditions for superconductivity nucleation realize at the distance @xmath18 from the crossing point . as a result , for rather small angles @xmath16 the center of the energetically favorable op distribution",
    "is shifted from the crossing point .",
    "this shift is accompanied by the striking phenomenon : the critical temperature @xmath9 of the localized superconductivity monotonously increases when the tilting angle @xmath17 tends to zero .",
    "such behavior makes the dependence @xmath19 nonanalytic at @xmath20 where the critical temperature exhibits a jump to the value @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for the case of the domain wall crossing the sample edge ( for two crossing domain walls ) .    in our work",
    "we suggest a simple variational procedure which allows us to get an approximate solution of a linearized ginzburg ",
    "landau equation describing the hybridization of the localized superconducting states for an arbitrary @xmath17 angle .",
    "we find out that different momenta of hybridized op modes are responsible for the formation of vortex chains outgoing from the crossing point of the channels .",
    "the effect of these chains on the op trial function appears to be extremely important for rather large @xmath17 angles close to @xmath23 .",
    "the important effect of such vortex chain can be illustrated for the simplest example of the superconductivity nucleation at the wedge corner .",
    "our calculations show that only taking into account the vortex chain one can get a proper crossover to the @xmath24 field with the increase in the wedge angle up to the flat one .",
    "the solution of a generic problem describing the superconductivity nucleation in a wedge allows us to find appropriate trial wave functions for superconducting op nucleating near the domain walls intersecting the film edge or near the crossing point of domain boundaries .",
    "the change in the @xmath17 angle is found to be accompanied by the change in the orientation of vortex chains and the intervortex distance .",
    "our analytical findings based on the variational procedure are in a good agreement with direct numerical simulations .    applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane",
    "one can observe the increase in the critical temperature of the domain wall superconductivity due to the partial magnetic field compensation inside the domains .",
    "using both variational and numerical approaches we have composed the phase diagram of the f / s bilayer in the plane temperature @xmath0  external magnetic field @xmath10 and discuss the transitions between different superconducting states by varying temperature @xmath0 , external magnetic field @xmath10 and magnetic stray field amplitude @xmath1 .",

    "let us analyze the problem of the op nucleation in a thin superconducting film placed in the non - uniform magnetic field @xmath25 induced by the external sources and the magnetic domain walls in a ferromagnetic substrate , respectively .",
    "note that we will restrict ourselves to the case of a step - like distribution of the magnetic stray fields of the domain walls and neglect the effect of the magnetic field components parallel to the film plane .",
    "in particular , for a single domain wall we take @xmath26 , where the @xmath27 axis is directed perpendicular to the corresponding domain wall .",
