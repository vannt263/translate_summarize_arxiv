    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a critical component of galactic structure .",
    "its role in the lifecycle of stars , mediating the transition from stellar death to stellar birth , evokes a sense of a `` galactic ecology '' @xcite .",
    "the ism provides a platform for the recycling of stellar material , by transferring and mixing the remnants of stellar nucleosynthesis and creating environments conducive for the creation of future generations of stars and planets .",
    "it also transfers energy and momentum , absorbing flows from supernovae blasts and strong winds from young stars and coupling these peculiar motions with galactic rotation and turbulence . ultimately , when a dense interstellar cloud collapses , it is the conservation of momentum from the parent cloud that leads to the formation of a protostellar disk from which stars and planets are formed .",
    "the local interstellar medium ( lism ) is the interstellar material that resides in close ( @xmath0100pc ) proximity to the sun . for a discussion on more distant ism structures ,",
    "see mcclure - griffiths , in this volume .",
    "proximity is a special characteristic that drives much of the interest in the lism .",
    "first , proximity provides an opportunity to observe general ism phenomena in great detail , and in three dimensions .",
    "ism structures and processes are repeated almost _ ad infinitum _ in our own galaxy @xcite , and beyond in other galaxies @xcite , even at high redshift @xcite .",
    "knowledge of general ism phenomena in our local corner of the galaxy , discussed in  2 , can be applied to more distant and difficult to observe parts of the universe .",
    "second , proximity implies an interconnectedness .",
    "the relationship between stars and their surrounding interstellar environment will be discussed in  3 , with particular attention paid to the interaction of the sun with the lism . in  4 , the consequences of the relationship between stars and the lism on planetary atmospheres are discussed , and the lism - earth , or more generally , the ism - planet connection is explored in more detail .",
    "this manuscript should not be considered a comprehensive review of the subject of the lism , but an individual , and biased , thread through a rich research area .",
    "i certainly will not be able to explore many lism topics to the level they deserve , nor will i be able to highlight all the work done by the large number of researchers in this area .",
    "hopefully , this short review will introduce you to some new ideas , and the references provided can escort you to even more work that was not specifically mentioned in this manuscript .",
    "measuring the morphological and physical characteristics of the nearest interstellar gas has long been of interest to astronomers .",
    "observations of the general ism via interstellar extinction of background stars @xcite , the 21 cm h hyperfine transition @xcite , or foreground interstellar absorption in optical resonance lines @xcite typically focus on more distant ism environments due to the observational challenges inherent in measuring the properties of the lism ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "recent reviews that focus specifically on the lism by @xcite and @xcite also provide some discussion on the history of the field .",
    "the lism is a diverse collection of gas .",
    "the outer bound of what i consider to be `` local '' in the context of the lism , is the edge of local bubble ( lb ) , coincident , by definition , with the location of the nearby dense molecular clouds , such as taurus and ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "figure[fig1 ] is a schematic illustration of the volume populated by the lism , adapted from a similar figure by @xcite . within the lism volume ,",

    "several warm partially ionized clouds , such as the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) and the galactic ( g ) cloud , are observed within the local bubble .",
    "the lic is the material that directly surrounds our solar system .",
    "the internal pressure and ram pressure of the lic , functions of its density and velocity relative to the sun , balance the force of the outward - moving solar wind to define the boundary and shape of the heliosphere ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the heliospheric structure is not unique to the sun , but is observed around other stars , including the nearest stellar system , @xmath3cen @xcite . nor is the heliospheric structure static .",
    "the heliosphere will expand and contract , in response to the density of the lism material surrounding the sun ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the boundary between the lism and the solar system is not an obvious one .",
    "the oort cloud contains the most distant objects that are gravitationally bound to the sun , which reside at a third of the distance to @xmath3cen .",
    "the oort cloud is completely enclosed by lism material , and due to the short extent of the lic in the direction of @xmath3cen @xcite , oort cloud objects in that direction may be surrounded by a different collection of gas ( g cloud material ) than surrounds our planetary system ( lic material ) .",
    "currently , even much of the kuiper belt ( kb ) extends beyond the bow shock ( bs ) into pristine lism material ( see sheppard , in this volume ) .",
    "some neutral lism material can penetrate well into the solar system .",
    "this material is utilized to make _ in situ _ measurements of properties of the lic ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the interconnectedness of our solar system with our surrounding interstellar medium could have important consequences for planetary atmospheres ( see  4 ) .",
    "_ hot gas : local bubble_the local bubble refers to the apparent lack of dense cold material within approximately 100pc of the sun .",
    "therefore , the distance to the edge of the local bubble cavity is equal to the distance at which cold dense gas is first observed .",
    "@xcite were able to map out the contours of the local bubble by tracing the onset of the detection of foreground na absorption lines in the spectra of @xmath41000 early type stars .",
    "in general , the interstellar material within the local bubble is too hot for neutral sodium , and therefore none is detected until the edge of the local bubble is reached .",
    "the edge of the local bubble can be as close as 60pc , and as far as @xmath4250pc , or even unbound , as toward the north and south galactic poles @xcite .",
    "the hot gas within the local bubble is notoriously difficult to observe .",
    "early direct detections of million degree gas came from diffuse soft x - ray emission @xcite , although part of this emission is now thought to be caused by charge exchange reactions in the heliosphere , the same process that causes comets to emit x - rays @xcite .",
    "absorption lines of highly ionized elements are generally weak or not detected , as @xcite found when looking for o absorption toward nearby white dwarfs . detecting emission from highly ionized atoms",
    "has also been more difficult than expected .",
    "using the _ cosmic hot interstellar plasma spectrometer _",
    "( _ chips _ ) , @xcite do not detect the array of extreme ultraviolet emission lines that are predicted from the `` standard '' local bubble temperature and density .",
    "canonically , it is thought that the local bubble is filled with @xmath5k , @xmath6@xmath7 gas that extends about @xmath8pc .",
    "however , much work remains to be done to understand the nature of the hot local bubble gas .",

    "several properties of warm lism clouds are not well known .",
    "except for the material currently streaming into the solar system , volume densities are very difficult to measure .",
    "inherent in absorption line observations are : ( 1 ) the ignorance of a length scale to the absorbing material , other than the limit set by the distance of the background star , and ( 2 ) the ignorance of density variations within a single collection of gas , since only the total column density is observed",
    ".    measurements of the magnetic field in the lism have also been difficult to make . for lack of better measurements , observations of distant ( several kpc ) pulsars",

    "possible scenarios include : ( 1 ) the presence of a lism magnetic field of @xmath44.8@xmath43 g to match the hot local bubble pressure , ( 2 ) refinement of local bubble observations and models that may reduce the local bubble pressure , in particular refining the x - ray and extreme ultraviolet observations of nearby hot gas @xcite , or ( 3 ) the hot and warm components of the lism are not in pressure equilibrium .",

    "this kind of work has a long and rich history , but has typically been dominated by more distant ism environments , with large column densities and strong absorption signatures @xcite .",
    "the challenge inherent in absorption line spectroscopy of the lism is the low column density along sightlines to nearby stars .",

    "the lower sensitivity limit indicates a 3@xmath53 detection in a high signal - to - noise observation with modern high resolution instruments .",
    "the upper sensitivity limit marks the column density at which the transition becomes optically thick and leaves the linear part of the curve of growth , where , although absorption is detected , limited information can be obtained from the saturated absorption profile .",

    "initial steps have been made toward this end with global bulk flow kinematic models of the lic and g clouds produced by @xcite , and a global morphological model of the lic by @xcite .",
    "future lism research will synthesize the growing database of lism observations , taking advantage of the information contained in the comparison of numerous individual sightlines . a global morphological model",

    "as discussed in reference to figure[fig1 ] , the interaction between the lism and solar / stellar winds is mediated by the heliospheric / astrospheric interface .",
    "this interface is defined by the balance between the solar / stellar wind and the lism .",
    "reviews of heliospheric modeling include @xcite and @xcite , and the detection of astrospheres around nearby stars is reviewed by @xcite .      in the standard picture of the heliosphere , discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the magnetized solar wind is shocked to subsonic speeds ( `` termination shock '' ) , as is the ionized lism material ( `` bow shock '' ) . the interface in between ( `` heliopause '' ) is where the plasma flows of the solar wind and lism are deflected from each other .",
    "it was originally thought that neutral atoms from the lism pass through the heliosphere unimpeded and therefore have a negligible influence on the structure of the heliosphere . however , charge exchange reactions between ionized hydrogen in the solar wind and neutral hydrogen in the lism act to heat and decelerate lism hydrogen atoms just prior to the heliopause .",
    "the resulting structure , referred to as the `` hydrogen wall , '' is an accumulation of hot hydrogen between the heliopause and the bow shock .    at the same time that heliospheric simulations were indicating an enhancement of hydrogen just beyond the heliopause",
    ", it was becoming clear that observations of lism absorption in h lyman@xmath3 were discrepant with other lism absorption lines along the same line of sight .",
    "in particular , excess h absorption was required on the red and blue sides of the lism h absorption feature , in order to be consistent with the optically thin d absorption profile , which is only 82kms@xmath17 to the blue of the h absorption .",
    "the models predicted a column density for the `` hydrogen wall '' of @xmath56(@xmath23)@xmath5714.5 . from figure[fig2 ] , it is clear that only the lyman series hydrogen lines are sensitive enough to detect these low column densities .",
    "indeed , heliospheric h absorption was first detected using the lyman-@xmath3 profile , when @xcite measured excess absorption redshifted with respect to the lism absorption .",
    "the blueshifted excess absorption is associated with an astrosphere . because we observe the decelerated heliospheric hydrogen from the inside , the heliospheric absorption is redshifted , whereas the decelerated hydrogen in an astrosphere is observed exterior to the astrosphere , and therefore is blueshifted , see figure6 of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that if the interstellar absorption gets to be too large , @xmath56(@xmath23)@xmath5818.7 , the saturated ism absorption will obliterate any sign of a slightly offset heliospheric or astrospheric absorption .",
    "so , these measurements are only possible within the low column density volume of the lism . among a sample of nearby stars , heliospheric and",
    "astrospheric absorption has been detected for many stars @xcite .",
    "multiple heliospheric detections sample the structure of our heliosphere in three dimensions , while multiple astrospheric detections provide measurements of weak solar - like winds around other stars .",
    "more than 50% of stars within 10pc that have high resolution uv lyman-@xmath3 spectra show signs of astrospheric absorption @xcite .",
    "_ short term_the solar wind strength and distribution fluctuate with the 11-year solar cycle @xcite .",
    "these variations slowly propagate out to the heliospheric boundary and it is expected that the heliopause will expand and contract on a comparable timescale .",
    "the stochastic injection of energy into the solar wind in the form of flares and mass ejections leads to variability on even shorter timescales .",
    "this dynamic wind is constantly buffeting the magnetospheres of planets in its path as well as the heliospheric boundary .",
    "voyager1 may have detected such short - term variability when over a 7-month period in 2003 the termination shock contracted inward , over voyager1 , and then expanded back outward over voyager1 yet again , a year before voyager1 unambiguously crossed the termination shock @xcite . due to the immensity of ism clouds , even the smallest of lism structures",

    "density variations spanning 6 orders of magnitude are commonly observed throughout the general ism .",

    "discussion of a lism - earth connection has an incredibly long history . @xcite and @xcite are among the earliest references .",
    "research has intensified as of late ; observations and models have improved , geologic and climatic events remain unexplained , and it is becoming clear that the habitability of planets may be dependent on subtle astrobiological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the sun is now surrounded by a relatively modest density cloud , the lic , and the heliopause stands well beyond the planets at @xmath4100au . however , when the sun encounters more dense ism clouds , the heliosphere will shrink , perhaps to within the inner solar system .",

    "cosmic rays are important sources of ionization in the upper atmosphere , creating showers of secondary particles , ultimately leading to muons , which dominate the cosmic ray flux in the lower atmosphere .",
    "ions in the atmosphere may serve as cloud nucleation sites , increasing low altitude clouds and ultimately increasing the planetary albedo @xcite .",
    "a connection between cosmic rays and clouds was suggested by @xcite and a correlation between cosmic ray flux and low cloud cover over the course of a solar cycle was found by @xcite , even though the global cosmic ray flux varied by only @xmath415% .",
    "the 12 orders of magnitude variation that would result from the loss of the heliospheric screen could have a tremendous impact on the formation of clouds in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the ionization caused by cosmic ray secondaries may also trigger lightning production @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays increase the production of no and no@xmath60 in the upper stratosphere , which significantly influences ozone layer chemistry .",
    "@xcite tracked the enhancement of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide that resulted from an injection of low energy cosmic rays following a series of intense solar storms .",
    "in some locations within the polar vortex , the increased levels of no and no@xmath60 led to 60% reductions in terrestrial ozone over several months .",
    "muons , electrons , and other cosmic ray products are significant natural radiation sources , accounting for 3040% of the annual dose from natural radiation in the united states @xcite .",
    "muons ionize atoms in our bodies , producing hydroxyl radicals , which can cause dna mutations",
    ". the cosmic muon flux can be significant even at depths of 1 km below the earth s surface , and is therefore a source of mutation even for deep - sea or deep - earth organisms .",
    "the loss of the heliospheric screen , and the subsequent increase in cosmic ray flux on the earth s atmosphere , could have important implications for the long - term evolution of the earth s climate , and for long - term mutation rates in terrestrial organisms .",
    "_ dust deposition_passage through dense ism environments will compress the heliosphere while also depositing a significant amount of interstellar dust onto the top of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "@xcite presented atmospheric models in which large amounts of interstellar dust cause a reverse greenhouse effect , blocking or scattering incident visible light while being transparent to infrared thermal radiation .",
    "@xcite also find that increased deposition of interstellar h@xmath60 onto earth s atmosphere would decrease mesospheric ozone levels , decrease the mesospheric temperature , and cause high altitude noctilucent ice clouds , which would ultimately increase the planetary albedo .",
    "dust deposition could be a natural trigger for `` snowball '' earth episodes , periods of @xmath4200,000 years in which the earth is entirely glaciated @xcite .",
    "most of the work on the lism - earth or ism - planet connection has been theoretical .",
    "the few observational tests of this relationship have focused on correlating the largest ism fluctuations with the largest climatic or geological fluctuations .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed a correlation between the passage through spiral arms , the glaciation period , and the cosmic ray flux derived from iron meteorites .",
    "the most significant hurdles that these kinds of empirical tests must overcome are the extreme systematic errors that plague long - term astronomical , climatic , and meteoritic timescales that are so vital to demonstrating a convincing correlation . invoking passage through spiral",
    "arms and major glaciations requires accurate temporal calibration back more than a billion years .",
    "although it is intuitive to attach the largest fluctuations in the ism to the largest fluctuations in the climatic record , with respect to the modulation of the cosmic ray flux , modest density clouds may have a significant influence . as demonstrated in the model by @xcite",
    ", a modest density lism has a dramatic effect on the structure of the heliosphere .",
    "although higher density environments would compress the heliosphere still further , there will be a point of diminishing returns as the incident cosmic ray flux on earth s atmosphere approaches the galactic cosmic ray flux level .",
    "future work will explore the evolution of the heliosphere through a variety of ism environments , besides our current lism surroundings and intermediate to the extremes of giant molecular clouds in the heart of spiral arms .",
    "_ historical solar trajectory_linking the long - term timing of ice ages with spiral arm passages will continue to be an interesting test of the ism - planet connection , but the lism provides a provocative alternative empirical test ( work in collaboration with j. scalo and d.s .",
    "smith ) . as discussed in  2 , we know precisely the nature of the lism that directly surrounds our solar system now from _ in situ _ measurements of the lic .",
    "if we look at a very nearby star , in the direction of the historical solar trajectory @xcite , the observed lism absorption should provide information on the nature of the lism that the sun encountered only a short time ago .",
    "( the sun travels 1pc in approximately 73,000 years . )",
    "if we continue this exercise , looking out the rearview mirror , so to speak , it should be possible to reconstruct a deterministic history of the ism that the sun experienced in the not - too - distant past .",
    "the sun s ism history could then be converted into a cosmic ray flux history , based on the heliospheric response to the historical interstellar density profile .",
    "as we sample more distant environments , and therefore more distant times , the peculiar motions of the sun and the ism cease to make a true deterministic history of the earth s cosmic ray flux possible , but would still represent a possible and plausible cosmic ray history of the earth , or any other planet orbiting a nearby star .",
    "although the most recently experienced ism environments may not include dense molecular clouds , nor the most recent climatic history include dramatic periods of global glaciations , such a short - term test does not suffer the systematics that make long - term correlations difficult .",
    "both the astronomical ( _ hipparcos _ distances to nearby stars ) and climatic @xcite records of the most recent past are sampled at high temporal resolution and are well calibrated .",
    "the lism is a unique conduit that connects large scale galactic and extragalactic structures with planetary atmospheres .",
    "although every observation of an astronomical object outside our solar system ( and even some `` within '' our solar system ) peers through the lism , we do not , as of yet , have a detailed three - dimensional global understanding of the morphological or physical properties of our own interstellar environment .",
    "the challenges of observing the properties of the lism are slowly being met with larger databases of high resolution spectra taken from the fuv to the optical , along sightlines toward nearby stars . due to the limited number of transitions that are sensitive to the low column densities of lism material , it is critical to have access to high resolution spectrographs from the fuv to the optical . with the recent loss of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _ , no high resolution astronomical spectrograph ( @xmath6150,000 ) is currently operating in the ultraviolet . a new high resolution uv instrument is needed in order to preserve and expand our observational capabilities in the uv . without such a facility , among other losses , we will no longer have the ability to observe gas in the lism , and risk being ignorant of our most immediate interstellar surroundings .",
    "the lism interacts with stellar and planetary systems and as we explore the subtle astrobiological parameters that control the degrees of habitability of planets , the role of the lism may turn out to be significant .",
    "since the lism , and the ism in general , is an important part of a grand `` galactic ecology , '' research on the lism touches many different areas of astrophysics , often at a profound level .",
    "carl sagan once said that `` we are made of star - stuff '' @xcite . created in stars , our `` stuff '' was mixed and transported from across the galaxy by the ism and , eventually , it is likely that this `` stuff '' will return there to be recycled yet again .",
