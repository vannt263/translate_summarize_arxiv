    "massive stars ( @xmath4 8m@xmath5 ) are responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the galaxy .",
    "they deposit large amounts of radiation , kinetic energy and enriched material into the interstellar medium ( ism ) throughout their formation , main - sequence lifetimes and when they explode as supernovae .",
    "massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) are the precursors to massive stars and are luminous ( @xmath6 10@xmath7l@xmath5 ) , mid - infrared point sources which have not yet begun to ionise their surroundings @xcite .",
    "the details of their early formation stages are difficult to probe observationally , due to their rare , clustered and embedded nature @xcite . as a result , the processes of massive star formation are still relatively uncertain when compared to the well studied low - mass star - formation paradigm @xcite .",
    "theoretical modelling suggests that , during their formation , mysos with high accretion rates ( 10@xmath8 m@xmath5yr@xmath9 ) swell due to the mass influx .",
    "consequently , they are deficient in ultraviolet ( uv ) photons until they begin contracting to a near - main - sequence configuration @xcite ; thus despite being very luminous , they are not initially ionising their surroundings . as the mysos contract towards the main sequence , they will then start to ionise the surrounding environment and form expanding hii regions @xcite . when the central stars reach the main sequence they generate copious amounts of uv photons , and so rapidly disrupt and destroy the natal cloud .",
    "identifying mysos and very young hii regions ( very compact radio emitters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a sample of sources in which the natal environment will be less disrupted and therefore closer to their initial conditions , while simultaneously facilitating the investigation of feedback from the massive protostars known to be forming . the red msx source ( rms )",
    "survey @xcite is an ideal sample for this since it spans a wide range of luminosity and evolutionary stage .",
    "it also allows us to study how molecular gas properties vary as a function of both time and source luminosity .",
    "this paper deals with the core properties of a sample of primarily northern rms sources .",
    "these observations constitute the only rms dataset so far in which the molecular - gas emission has been mapped , as opposed to obtaining single - pointing observations ( cf .",
    "the primary goal of the observations was to study molecular outflows using single - dish observations of @xmath10co , @xmath11co and c@xmath0o ( @xmath12 ) ( discussed in a companion paper : maud et al .",
    "2015 submitted to mnras ) .",
    "the aim of the c@xmath0o observations was to study the kinematical behaviour of the gas in the molecular core around the rms sources .",
    "this allows us to determine outflow properties more reliably , but also permits us to study the cores separately .",
    "single - dish c@xmath0o ( 3@xmath122 ) is generally optically thin @xcite and excited in the denser regions when compared with lower - excitation transitions of co ( e.g. @xmath130 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 emission is much less confused with line - of - sight emission than lower - excitation transitions , and a critical density for the transition of @xmath14@xmath15 ( with most emission expected to come from significantly higher densities - cf .",
    "@xcite ) , makes it an ideal tracer of the core structures in star - forming regions .",
    "section [ obs_core ] describes the source sample and observations undertaken , with section [ meth_cores ] detailing the method used to calculate all source masses and their radii .",
    "section [ samp ] presents the basic results and the comparisons with previous data from the literature and the rms survey itself .",
    "section [ analysis ] discusses various relationships with source properties and in section [ comp_lum_co ] we compare our results with a simple model to examine the star formation efficiency and protostellar evolution .",
    "a summary is given in section [ conc ] .",
    "the sources were chosen from all mysos and hii regions in the rms survey that are located within a distance of @xmath36kpc , have luminosities @xmath6 3000l@xmath5 , and are observable with the jcmt ( declinations @xmath1225@xmath16 to @xmath1765@xmath16 ) , with some additional right ascension constraints set by the observing dates . in addition , for the hii regions , only those sources which appear compact in higher resolution mid - infrared images were selected . finally although all of the sources with @xmath18l@xmath5 were observed , only a random sample of the less luminous ones were included ( see below ) .",
    "the original selection was made using the pre-2008 rms catalogue and resulted in 99 target sources representative of the @xmath3200 mysos and compact hii regions satisfying these criteria in the catalogue at that time . since 2008 , the rms catalogue has evolved significantly as a result of subsequent observations . the updates to the rms database have resulted in 10 of the initial sources now being assigned a kinematic distance beyond 6kpc , where luminosities are only complete to @xmath310@xmath19 l@xmath5 @xcite ; these are removed from the statistical sample ( although masses are still calculated where possible ) .",
    "the luminosities for all sources have been recalculated using the most up - to - date source distances @xcite and multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits from @xcite .",
    "as luminosities have changed the sample now extends to @xmath31000l@xmath5 , but is not complete below the original limits .",
    "finally , there are now a total of @xmath3311 sources in the rms catalogue that satisfy the original distance - limited criteria described above . of these",
    ", we would expect about 50 hii regions to be too extended ( based upon the rms classifications ) , so that a complete distance - limited sample from the final catalogue would number approximately 260 sources .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : dist_lum ] shows the luminosity distributions of the remaining 89 sources ( dark grey ) and of @xmath3450 objects in the rms database ( light grey ) now matching the original criteria ( but where l@xmath41000l@xmath5 and source types are myso and both compact and extended hii regions ) .",
    "the right panel shows the luminosities as a function of distance in the two sets of sources ( filled and open circles , respectively ) .",
    "both plots indicate that the range of luminosities and range of distances probed by the original observed sample is representative of all sources in the rms database that satisfy the selection criteria .",
    "it is clear that the observed sample is incomplete in terms of relative numbers of sources at luminosities below @xmath20l@xmath5 ( above which the rms survey is now complete ) .",
    "this was always intended however , since our initial sampling aimed to have approximately equal numbers per logarithmic luminosity bin . since all the analyses in this paper are essentially of ratios of observed quantities ( e.g. section [ comp_lum_co ] , where luminosity is concerned ) , this numerical incompleteness is not a significant problem .",
    "all 99 sources were observed with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) as part of projects m07au08 , m07bu16 , m08au19 and m08bu18 during 2007 and 2008 .",

    "the maps were taken in raster - scan mode with continuous ( on - the - fly ) sampling and position switching to observe a ` clean ' reference position at the end of each scan row .",

    "the pointing was checked with reference to a known bright molecular source prior to each source observation .",

    "as a final consistency check , we sum all the data within the aperture into a single spectrum and derive a mass from a gaussian fit to this profile , as shown in the right panel .",
    "the result in this case is 149 @xmath44 6m@xmath5 , consistent with the previous estimate from velocity integration and aperture summation .",
    "gaussian fitting of each individual spectrum ( at each pixel ) in the data cube is not used , however , as this would require _ a priori _ knowledge of the source size and emission region , which is only established after the integration stage .",
    "the source radii are calculated using the area within the defined apertures .",
    "an effective circular radius can simply be defined as @xmath45 the deconvolved radius , assuming the jcmt has a gaussian beam of diameter 15.3 arcseconds is    @xmath46 ^ 2 - 15.3 ^ 2\\right)^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    we tested for the influence that extended , low - surface - brightness emission might have on these values by clipping the data below 30percent of the peak value rather than at the 3@xmath43 contour .",
    "although the deconvolved radii decrease , the masses also decrease by a similar factor when calculated within the same area .",
    "virial - type analyses are therefore resilient against the choice of threshold .",
    "the mass and radius attributed to the cores are therefore consistent and refer to the same area as in previous similar studies ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : table1 ] lists the sources , positions and important parameters extracted from the rms survey online archive . in some cases , the types are listed as yso / hii where observable characteristics are consistent with both the myso and hii - region classification and a definitive type can not be ascertained @xcite . in some sources , multiple , close ( a few arcsec separation ) ,",
    "ir - bright targets have been identified ( three targets would be listed as a , b , c in the online archive , for example ) .",
    "the yso / hii type is also used for these sources , if at least one myso and one hii region is included .",
    "individual mysos and hii regions are inseparable at the resolution of the jcmt observations .",

    "indeed , appropriate projections of the mass - luminosity - radius plane , for example , result in most data points being strongly clustered ( i.e. , there is a mass - radius - luminosity fundamental plane ) , though the luminosity component of this relationship is small , and the same is true for mass , fwhm and radius .",
    "the first of these can be understood , for example , as larson s third relation ( mass - radius ) but modified for the case of cores where a not insignificant fraction of the mass is now locked into stars ( and hence not traced by the gas mass : cf .",
    "section [ sfe ] ) .",
    "the weak luminosity dependence of this mass - radius relation effectively compensates by directly tracing the mass already locked into stars .",
    "the strong correlation of mass and luminosity reflects the fact that these sources are of a similar evolutionary state , otherwise more scatter would be evident .",
    "@xcite shows that hii regions can be of a similar age to massive protostars if the central source is itself more massive ( i.e. more massive objects evolve more quickly towards the zero age main sequence ) .",
    "this conclusion is justified further in section [ comp_lum_co ] .",
    "it is notable that the fwhm and radius ( larson s first relation ) gives the weakest correlation , as shown in table [ tab : kendall ] .",
    "we will discuss this and the other larson relations in detail in the following sections , as well as comparing our results with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used @xmath11co @xmath47 data from the galactic ring survey @xcite to re - examine the underlying physical principles that lead to larson s scaling relations for molecular - cloud - sized structures and , hence , sampled much larger regions but with much lower surface densities .",
    "@xcite analysed atlasgal sources ( including those with rms counterparts ) and hence studied the continuum dust emission of similar regions to us",
    ".    some of the properties that show no correlation are also worth mentioning .",
    "the line asymmetry parameter shows no correlation with any other properties , including the line opacity itself for example .",
    "there are no correlations between infrared colour and properties such as mass , or line asymmetry , where both red and blue asymmetric data show the same average colour , or between most of the co properties ( including opacity and column density ) and infrared colour .",
    "the beamsize of our jcmt data are not dissimilar to many of the mid- and far - infrared data we use the infrared colours from .",
    "the natural explanation for the lack of correlation therefore is that there is substructure within the beam for both sets of data .",
    "in particular the co data presented here traces cooler gas , whereas the infrared colours we have are predominantly a combination of hot and warm dust and extinction .",
    "the spatial scales of these components should differ considerably but we are unable to probe such detail .",
    "this also tallies with the discussion above regarding the actual correlation seen between @xmath27 or @xmath48 and colour .",
    "previous observations of molecular clouds / cores suggest a power - law scaling between mass and length scale ( size , radius ) of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their observations include different regions , associations ( low- and high - mass stars ) and observations using both molecular line tracers and continuum emission .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_rad ] shows the c@xmath0o masses plotted against deconvolved radius for our sample .",
    "the linear trend when including the flag 0 , 1 and 2 sources follows the power law @xmath51 , where the uncertainty only accounts for the spread in the raw mass and radius values .",
    "note , exchanging the deconvolved radii for the effective radii has a minimal effect and slightly steepens the slope to @xmath52 .",
    "the atlasgal clumps associated with rms sources investigated by @xcite span a larger range of radii and mass , and follow a slightly shallower slope ( @xmath53 ) overall .",
    "there is a turnover in their data at higher masses , such that if we restrict the range to that of our sample a slightly steeper slope @xmath31.9 would be recovered .",
    "however , the discrepancy in slopes can be attributed to the different methods in which mass and radius are calculated ( we see that the slope changes when using effective radius ) .",
    "@xcite find that the large scale clump properties follow the same trend from embedded maser sources to extended hii regions ( i.e. less to more evolved ) .",
    "they suggest the clump properties must therefore be set prior to the onset of star formation and that the subsequent evolution of massive protostars , and their feedback , does not effect the clumps overall .",
    "note that the internal structures may still evolve ( cf .",
    "the study of @xcite which examined mass as a function of radius within single clumps , as opposed to the inter - clump comparisons given here ) .",
    "we basically find the same relations as @xcite from the gas as opposed to dust .",
    "@xcite find @xmath54 , again in reasonable agreement with the slope found here .    where the heyer data differs from the smaller clump / core sized regions studied here is in the offset of this relationship , which lies at lower masses in the heyer et al sample .",
    "fundamentally , both our sources and those of @xcite are significantly more massive than the similar size regions in the sample of @xcite .",
    "it is worth reiterating that heyer et al .",
    "used @xmath130 @xmath11co data .",
    "the comparison in section [ line_rels ] for our objects suggests such lines should be broader ( due to opacity ) than the @xmath12 c@xmath0o .",
    "therefore , if anything , the _ true _ offset from a fair comparison with the heyer et al .",

    "this comparison is analogous to the type-2 , single tracer multi - core relationships presented in @xcite where the fwhm is observed to decrease for smaller cores .",
    "the meaningful result of such a relationship is to examine whether the cores are virialised , where fwhm@xmath57 is expected .",
    "the bisector fit best represents the data given the scatter ( compared with ordinary least squares fitting , ols , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in fwhm@xmath58r@xmath59 , roughly consistent with virialised cores .",
    "however , as already noted ( table [ tab : kendall ] ) , the significance of the correlation seen here is very weak ( it is notably stronger for the data from @xcite ) . as with the results of the previous section ,",
    "a noticeable offset exists in the relationship seen here and that of molecular cloud scales from the data of @xcite .",
    "the cores here exhibit much larger fwhm values .",
    "one possible cause for the weaker correlation and larger values is that on these scales feedback has a more significant impact compared to gravitational motions .",
    "@xcite noted a clear relationship between mass and velocity dispersion ( linewidth ) over many orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "recent studies have confirmed this , though the tight relationship larson found is less well reproduced .",
    "as the core masses are strongly related to the source radii , which in turn are weakly correlated to the linewidth , there is expected to be a link between mass and fwhms for these sources .",
    "figure [ fig : fwhmmass ] shows the correlation present between the mass and fwhm linewidths",

    "however , the virial masses can also be used as an additional test to investigate the impact of feedback from these sources .",
    "figure [ fig : virial ] shows the c@xmath0o core masses against the calculated virial masses following @xcite :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the deconvolved radius , we use the fwhm of the c@xmath0o emission and assume spherical cores with a @xmath66 density distribution and no magnetic support .",
    "changes in geometry , or the density law ( figure [ fig : mass_rad ] would imply a @xmath67 for a spherical geometry for example ) , generally increases the virial mass by up to 50percent ( cf .",
    "furthermore , we note that the virial masses would have artificially been elevated if optically thick tracers such as @xmath10co and @xmath11co were used for this analysis given their larger linewidths .",
    "using the @xmath11co ( 3@xmath122 ) data would result in an increased virial mass by a factor of @xmath32 , furthermore optically thick , lower density @xmath68 = 1@xmath120 transitions could cause an increase larger than a factor of @xmath35 if linewidths are more than double those measured here .",
    "it is therefore important that confirmed , optically thin tracers are used when calculating virial masses .",
    "the c@xmath0o gas masses in the sample are closely matched with the virial masses and are distributed about the 1:1 line ( figure [ fig : virial ] dot - dashed line ) , the results are consistent with those found for a smaller sample of ir - bright sources by @xcite .",
    "however , the bisector fit to the data shows that the lower mass cores are actually skewed towards being unbound whereas the more massive ones are @xmath3virialised , more clearly shown in figure [ fig : virial_ratio ] plotting the virtial ratio versus core mass .",
    "this trend is seen by ( @xcite , and @xcite for individual datasets ) where @xmath69/@xmath70 increases with decreasing clump mass .",
    "@xcite argue that these trends can be explained if higher mass cores collapse and evolve rapidly through to the formation of their final stars , whereas lower mass cores may still have support present from , for example , outflow activity",
    ". our results here are consistent with this picture .",
    "only higher spatial resolution data will finally allow us to determine whether these global trends are reflected for individual protostellar sites , and how these interact with each other as a core collapses as a whole .",
    "@xmath3 @xmath69 and are @xmath3virialised , with a weak tendency for the lower mass cores to be less so than high mass cores .",

    "it is clear to see the more massive cores are closer to equilibrium , whereas the smaller ones have larger virial masses than the core mass .",
    "representative 50percent errors in the core mass and virial ratio ( dominated by core mass uncertainty ) are indicated to the bottom left.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    there is no correlation between the surface density and radius , as expected for the larson - like mass - radius scaling we observe in our data .",
    "there is however a scatter of almost an order of magnitude in the surface density .",
    "this correlates positively with the opacity in the @xmath11co line , in the sense that the highest surface densities have the highest opacities .",
    "however this can also be viewed in terms of the discussion regarding whether the larson relations are actually a function of the limiting surface density ( or column density , opacity or extinction ) seen for molecular cloud samples rather than an underlying self - similar scaling relationship ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though see @xcite for a discussion of possible biases in the actual observational evidence for this .",
    "the rationale is that below this threshold there is insufficient shielding to allow molecular gas to form efficiently ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the limiting star - formation surface density found by , e.g. @xcite , lies below the threshold of our sample as expected given figure [ fig : mass_rad ] .",
    "we see no trend in the star - formation - rate surface density with gas surface density ( as is evident from mass - luminosity plots , which essentially show the same data given the correct mass - radius correlation ) .",
    "however the correlation of surface density with opacity is consistent with this general concept of a threshold .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , if virial motions were the primary drivers of the larson relationships , thus leading to a single surface density value regardless of size of cloud , then we should expect to see the ratio @xmath71 as a constant .",
    "figure [ fig : heyer ] shows the equivalent plot for our data .",
    "this clearly shows that this scaling depends on surface density , just as they found ( and as seen in many other samples including that of larson @xmath12 @xcite ) . in part",
    "this is consistent with the other results we have already discussed .",
    "the _ scaling _ apparent in larson s relations depends critically on both the objects observed ( i.e. real physical differences ) and on the methods used .",
    "crucially , the area over which the surface density is calculated should be matched with the appropriate kinematic data , and not cross matched with other measures , and as we have already noted , derived from an optically thin tracer that is representative of the structures in question . in principle if these simple guidelines are followed we can compare relatively dissimilar samples .",
    "figure [ fig : heyer ] shows the sample of clouds from @xcite , as well as our own .",
    "@xcite also showed a similar plot for data from the infrared dark cloud sample of @xcite .",
    "we show both the virial line expected for this plot from @xcite and the free - fall prediction from @xcite .",
    "the data are best matched by the latter .",
    "this relationship is essentially carrying the same messages as the fact that mass , radius and fwhm form a fundamental plane , with the large velocity dispersion objects being those which are most massive for a particular radius .",
    "it also essentially embeds the same result seen in figure [ fig : virial_ratio ] , since lower virial ratios for more massive objects tend to tally with higher velocity dispersions for higher surface densities as well .",
    "55percent and @xmath37percent for surface density and velocity dispersion / radius@xmath72 respectively . ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally we note that we find a strong linear correlation between the star formation rate surface density ( derived from the luminosity @xcite ) and the gas surface density ratioed with the free fall time .",
    "this is in agreement with the discussion in @xcite , but we would note that the correlation seen is inevitable given the form of the mass radius relationship .",
    "relationships between mass and luminosity can provide insights into star - formation efficiency and evolution in the cores . in our case",
    "the gas masses and source luminosities are independently established , whereas other works often obtain them via the same means , e.g. points in the mm / sub - mm sed .",
    "the downside to this is that many of the luminosities we have derived are at high spatial resolution , generally of the dominant source present within the original msx beam .",
    "therefore the c@xmath0o maps for such sources have effective radii larger than the `` typical '' beamsize for the sed from which we derive the luminosity .",
    "however , it is important to confirm that relationships found between continuum mass and luminosities are not due to effectively comparing the same data with itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : fig14 ] plots rms source luminosity against core gas mass for both mysos and hii regions ( open and filled symbols , respectively ) .",
    "a linear relationship is observed for both mysos and hii regions when plotting sources with mass flags 0 , 1 and 2 ( and when including flag 4 sources ) .",
    "the fitted mass - luminosity relationship for mysos only is @xmath73 and for hii regions only it is @xmath74 ( using a bisector fit that best represents the scatter in the data for flag 0 , 1 , 2 and 4 sources , as the latter follow the same trend ) .",
    "@xcite find this slope continues for @xmath32 orders of magnitude in mass moving to much larger clump scales ( radius @xmath4 1pc ) .",
    "evolutionary pre - main sequence tracks from @xcite , based on the model of @xcite , are also shown in figure [ fig : fig14 ] . the basic physics that underpins these tracks is relatively simple .",
    "protostars continuously increase in luminosity , both through their strong accretion phases and during kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) contraction , until they reach their eventual zero age main sequence ( zams ) configuration ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . once on the main sequence , massive and intermediate mass stars fairly quickly disperse their natal molecular material through the action of their ionising radiation and winds .",
    "we have also plotted the location of the stellar zams in figure [ fig : fig14 ] .",
    "we take stellar luminosities from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5.11 ) for masses ranging from 0.5m@xmath5 to 6m@xmath5 and from @xcite for masses @xmath46m@xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the total mass of stars @xmath75 = @xmath70 and the protostellar masses are distributed according to the salpeter power - law imf ( using only stellar masses from 0.5 to 150 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to a star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) of 50 percent , following @xcite [ sfe = @xmath75/(@xmath75 @xmath17 @xmath76 ) ] , if no gas has been lost due to winds or outflows .",
    "this zams line is shown as the dot - dashed line on figure [ fig : fig14 ] , and the evolutionary tracks as dotted lines , for initial core masses of 80 , 140 , 350 , 700 and 2000m@xmath5 .",
    "the turnover in the @xcite tracks towards envelope dispersal occurs on this zams line as expected .",
    "a change in the sfe is equivalent to shifting this zams line right or left ( the luminosity does not change , but the residual core mass is either greater for a lower sfe or less for a greater sfe ) .",
    "this is discussed further in the next section .",
    "we have not attempted to model a cluster of stars in detail , given that high mass stars evolve more quickly than lower mass stars , and hence reach their zams luminosity more quickly . at least for clusters of protostars",
    "this should mean that the higher mass members dominate the luminosity ( the same is not true for hii regions - @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively small scatter in this diagram suggests that most of the objects we have observed are of similar evolutionary stage , as noted by @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the hii regions overlap with the mysos , which suggests that our ` compact ' size criterion ensures that for the most part we have selected relatively young hii regions .",
    "@xcite note that the model pms tracks are variable and dependent upon accretion and core - dispersal rates , for example , such that they can shift both vertically and horizontally which may partially explain this spread , as could the observational errors in both mass and luminosity .",
    "furthermore , these tracks assume that the core does not gain mass from its surroundings by large - scale infall during star formation , and that one core leads to one star with a fixed star formation efficiency .",
    "if , for example , a core gains mass during the formation process , the tracks would also slant to the right as they increase in luminosity as they gain _ extra _ mass .",
    "an alternative explanation however is given by the timescales involved for each phase of evolution as a function of final mass .",
    "the most massive stars reach the zams ( and hence power hii regions ) much more rapidly than it takes a less massive star ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the most massive stars reach the zams and form h ii regions whilst still very heavily embedded .",
    "notably , the hii regions of lower mass appear more evolved on average in this figure than those of higher mass , which suggests that this is what we are seeing .",
    "although it is likely all scenarios contribute to some extent .",
    "the filled star symbols in figure [ fig : fig14 ] show the two hii regions flagged as 7 that are thought to be the most evolved and have dispersed their cores .",
    "their position to the far left hand side of the mass - luminosity diagram supports this interpretation .    both @xcite and @xcite find the lifetimes of myso and hii - region phases to be roughly comparable ( of the order 10@xmath77yr ) .",
    "in particular , figure 7 of @xcite illustrates how the source classifications for stars with final masses @xmath48m@xmath5 change ( from myso to hii region ) over a very narrow period in time where core masses and luminosities are still coincident . as",
    "this paper is a pre - cursor to a detailed investigation of molecular bipolar outflows , a narrow distribution of evolutionary stage makes this sample ideal for identifying trends in outflow parameters due to source properties , free from any effects of a spread in source ages .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use the @xmath78 ratio as an evolutionary tracer , where more evolved sources are more luminous and have dispersed more material from their cores / envelopes ( increasing @xmath78 ) in comparison with lower luminosity , deeply embedded sources ( the ` evolved ' flag 7 sources have @xmath78 @xmath6 10@xmath79 ) .",
    "@xcite indicate a clear dichotomy between 24@xmath80m - bright and dark sources in their survey of the g29.96 - 0.02 cloud . in a similar vein ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath78 in the hii regions are examined , looking for differences with mysos .",
    "of course one caveat is that we assume that to produce a source of a certain luminosity we always start at the same mass ( i.e. star formation efficiency does not vary ) .",
    "it is not clear that this is the case from core to core , and therefore can introduce some scatter in the distribution of sources ( as previously discussed ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the @xmath78 histogram for mysos and hii regions , and shows no clear difference between the two subsamples . both a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test and a mann - whitney u ( mwu ) test indicate that mysos and hii regions are drawn from the same distribution ( as also found by @xcite ) .",
    "the reported d value ( @xmath30.17 ) is not above that required ( @xmath40.32 ) for the sources to be detectably drawn from different distributions in the ks test .",
    "the reported mwu test probability ( @xmath30.46 ) is well above the 0.05 significance level and so the hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution is not rejected .",
    "the masses plotted in figure [ fig : fig14 ] are those of the clumps containing what is probably a cluster of protostars within which the massive protostar detected by the rms survey is forming . however , the luminosities could either be dominated by the most massive star , or be the total of all the protostars in the cluster .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : fig14 ] represents the luminosity of a single star , the most massive in the cluster . in principle",
    ", this line should set an upper envelope to the observed data for single stars , and allow us to derive an estimate of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) . as noted above ,",
    "although clusters of protostars are probably dominated by their most massive member , the cluster line still lies somewhat higher in luminosity than the single star line ( dashed line ) .",
    "the shape of the single star line matches the data reasonably well , suggesting that this simple model is reasonable , i.e. the most massive star dominates .",
    "the cluster line however , is steeper .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that we plot zams luminosities , which is a reasonable assumption for the more massive protostars , but probably underestimates the luminosity of accreting low mass protostars in theses clusters .",
    "the overall sfe should be the value that sets all of our observations below the actual model lines .",
    "if each of our objects genuinely only contained a single luminous source , or else they are on the track beyond the zams and into the core dispersal region , they will fall below the dot - dashed line .",
    "this requires a shift to lower core masses ( higher efficiencies ) by close to a factor of two .",
    "such a large shift , and high sfe ( @xmath460percent ) , appears implausible .",
    "instead the alternative that we are seeing clusters ( dashed line ) , still in agreement with our observations , which enhances the total luminosity at larger core masses by about a factor of two , seems plausible . in this case",
    "the sfe would be in the 40 - 50percent range .",
    "the core parameters of 94 sources ( of 99 ) mysos and hii regions selected as outflow candidates representative of the pre-2008 rms survey , have been established .",
    "the sample is reduced to 89 when enforcing the distance limit of 6kpc and is still representative of massive protostars across the myso to hii region transition in the up - to - date rms survey that now meet the original selection criteria .",
    "the majority of the cores exhibit a single , gaussian c@xmath0o line profile .",
    "larson - like relationships ( fwhm linewidth relationships with luminosity , radius and mass ) are found for all the cores , though the scaling for these is not continuous with other studies of larger - scale molecular clouds .",
    "the most fundamental relationship is between mass and core radius , which gives rise to a surface density independent of radius .",
    "we note , however , that the scatter in the surface density in this relation is well explained by the correlation with gas opacity and agrees with models in which larson - style relations arise due to the observed surface or column density limits .",
    "we find two possible fundamental planes in this work , representing core evolution ( mass - luminosity - radius ) and likely virial contributions ( mass - radius - fwhm ) .",
    "all cores appear to be virialised @xmath70 @xmath3 @xmath69 .",
    "core parameters on the observed scales are interpreted as being set prior to the onset of star formation and are not subsequently effected by the feedback from the massive protostars .",
    "a correlation is found between the dust - continuum masses and the core ( gas ) masses established from the c@xmath0o emission . at the resolution of the observations , both the dust - continuum emission and c@xmath0o emission trace the same material and structures in both myso and hii regions .",
    "the small differences found are all consistent with dust being a better tracer of diffuse low density gas on larger scales , whereas the c@xmath0o traces the dense hearts of the molecular clumps",
    ".    the sources are consistent with most of the luminosity arising in a single massive protostar ( or central zams stars for the hii regions ) .",
    "the tight banding of all sources in the m - l plot , accounting for scatter , indicates a similar evolutionary stage for both the mysos and hii regions investigated .",
    "this means they are ideal candidates to investigate relationships between outflow and source properties between the source types to be detailed in an upcoming paper .",
    "further development of the rms survey database is required with higher spatial resolution at millimetre / sub - millimetre wavelengths to understand how the core masses are specifically related to the immediate regions surrounding the most massive protostars on arcsecond scales .",
    "this will allow us to investigate whether the mass distributions are different for mysos and hii regions , if co depletion is present in these cores and on what spatial scale , whether cores have further velocity sub - structure influenced by outflows , and how larson - type relationships hold below 0.1pc scales .",
