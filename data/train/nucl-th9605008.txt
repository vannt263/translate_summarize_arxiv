    "the determination of the quadrupole excitation strength @xmath1 in the region of the @xmath8 resonance has been the aim of considerable experimental and theoretical activities . within the harmonic oscillator quark model ,",
    "the @xmath3 and the nucleon are both members of the symmetrical 56-plet of @xmath9 with orbital momentum @xmath10 , positive parity and a gaussian wave function in space . in this approximation the @xmath3 may only be excited by a magnetic dipole transition @xmath0 @xcite . however , in analogy with the atomic hyperfine interaction or the forces between nucleons , also the interactions between the quarks contain a tensor component due to the exchange of gluons .",
    "this hyperfine interaction admixes higher states to the nucleon and @xmath3 wave functions , in particular @xmath11-state components with @xmath12 , resulting in a small electric quadrupole transition @xmath1 between nucleon and @xmath3 @xcite , and a quadrupole moment of the @xmath3 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore an accurate measurement of @xmath1 is of great importance in testing the forces between the quarks and , quite generally , models of nucleons and isobars .    the ratio @xmath14 }                 { \\mid m_{1+}^{(3/2)}\\mid^{2}}\\ ] ] has been predicted to be in the range @xmath15 in the framework of constituent quark @xcite , relativized quark @xcite and chiral bag models @xcite . considerably larger values have been obtained in skyrme models @xcite .",
    "a first lattice qcd calculation resulted in a small value with large error bars @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , the connection of the model calculations with the experimental data is not evident .",
    "clearly , the @xmath3 resonance is coupled to the pion - nucleon continuum and final - state interactions will lead to strong background terms seen in the experimental data , particularly in case of the small @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "the question of how to  correct  the experimental data to extract the properties of the resonance has been the topic of many theoretical investigations . as some typical examples we refer the reader to the work of olsson @xcite , koch et al .",
    "@xcite and laget @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it turns out that the analysis of the small @xmath17 amplitude is quite sensitive to details of the models , e.g. nonrelativistic vs. relativistic resonance denominators , constant or energy - dependent widths and masses of the resonance , sizes of the form factor included in the width etc . in other words , by changing these definitions the meaning of resonance vs. background changes , too .",
    "more recently , nozawa et al .",
    "@xcite have included final - state interactions in a dynamical model with quark cores and pions , and davidson et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed photoproduction in terms of effective lagrangians , taking account of final - state interactions implicitly through unitarization . by fitting the parameters of the models to older sets of data , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a ratio @xmath18 for the bare @xmath19 coupling , while ref .",
    "@xcite deduced a value of @xmath20 , including some  dressing  from final - state interaction .",
    "a detailed discussion of these models and a comparison to the data is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in an extension of the work of nozawa et al .",
    ", bernstein et al .",
    "@xcite have decomposed the multipole contributions into resonant and background terms , and compared their analysis to previous investigations . as a result they obtained @xmath21 for the",
    " bare @xmath3  amplitude and @xmath22 for the  dressed @xmath3  . in very recent relativistic and unitarized pion photoproduction calculations , for the ",
    " ratios of @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite are found .    in order to study the @xmath3 deformation , pion photoproduction on the proton",
    "has recently been measured by the legs collaboration @xcite at brookhaven and by the a2 collaboration @xcite at mami using transversely polarized photons , i.e. by measuring the polarized photon asymmetry @xmath25 . in particular",
    ", the cross section @xmath26 for photon polarization in the reaction plane turns out to be very sensitive to the small @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "assuming for simplicity that only the @xmath27-wave multipoles contribute , the differential cross section is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the pion and photon momenta and @xmath31 is the pion emission angle in the @xmath4 frame . neglecting the ( small ) contributions of the roper multipole @xmath32 , one obtains @xcite @xmath33 because the isospin @xmath34 amplitudes strongly dominate the cross section for @xmath35 production .",
    "in the meantime new precision data have been obtained by the a2 collaboration at mami with polarized photons for both charged and neutral pion production over the energy range 270 mev @xmath36 420 mev @xcite .",
    "these data will make it possible to determine the partial wave amplitudes over the full region of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the preliminary data for @xmath35 production are in good agreement with the ratio @xmath37 measured by the legs collaboration , at the lower energies .",
    "starting from fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relations for the invariant amplitudes of pion photoproduction , the projection of the multipole amplitudes leads to a well known system of integral equations , @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for any of the multipoles @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the corresponding ( nucleon ) pole term .",
    "the kernels @xmath42 are known , and the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes are related by unitarity . in the energy region below two - pion threshold , unitarity is expressed by the final state theorem of watson @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the corresponding @xmath45 phase shift and @xmath46 an integer .",
    "we have essentially followed the method of schwela et al @xcite to solve eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) with the constraint ( [ watson ] ) .",
    "in addition we have taken account of the coupling to some higher states neglected in that earlier reference . at the energies above two - pion threshold up to @xmath47 gev , eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) has been replaced by an ansatz based on unitarity @xcite . finally , the contribution of the dispersive integrals from @xmath48 gev to infinity has been replaced by @xmath2-channel exchange , parametrized by certain fractions of @xmath49- and @xmath50-exchange .",
    "furthermore , we have to allow for the addition of solutions of the homogeneous equations to the coupled system of eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) .",
    "the whole procedure introduces 9 free parameters , which have to be determined by a fit to the data . in our data base",
    "we have included the recent mami experiments for @xmath51 and @xmath52 production off the proton in the energy range from 160 mev to 420 mev @xcite , both older and more recent data from bonn for @xmath53 production off the proton @xcite , and older frascati @xcite and more recent triumf data @xcite on @xmath54 production off the neutron . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : legs ] , the predicted cross sections are in perfect agreement with the ratio @xmath55 measured by the legs collaboration @xcite whose data have not been included in our fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_over_m ] we show our result for the ratio @xmath56 which is in general agreement with the analysis of the virginia group @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of a resonant partial wave as function of energy into the second riemann sheet should generally lead to a pole in the lower half - plane .",
    "a pronounced narrow peak reflects a time - delay in the scattering process due to the existence of an unstable excited state .",
    "this time - delay is related to the speed @xmath57 of the scattering amplitude @xmath58 , defined by @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total @xmath4 energy . in the vicinity of the resonance pole ,",
    "the energy dependence of the full amplitude @xmath61 is determined by the resonance contribution , @xmath62 while the background contribution @xmath63 should be a smooth function of energy , ideally a constant .",
    "we note in particular that @xmath64 indicates the position of the resonance pole in the complex plane , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants and differ from the energy - dependent widths , and possibly masses , derived from fitting certain resonance shapes to the data@xcite .",
    "if the energy dependence of @xmath67 is negligible , the speed is @xmath68 ^ 2            + \\gamma_{r}^2(m_{r}-w)^{2}\\}^\\frac{1}{2 } }            { \\{(m_{r}-w)^{2}+\\gamma_{r}^{2}/4\\}^{2}}.\\ ] ] obviously the speed has its maximum at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the half - maximum values are @xmath71 .",
    "this determines the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 as well as the absolute value @xmath72 of the residue .",
    "the phase @xmath73 of the complex residue at the pole may be determined from an argand plot of the speed vector @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted that the speed plot technique requires a reasonably smooth representation of the amplitude in order to differentiate it in a meaningful way . as has been shown by hhler @xcite in the case of @xmath45 scattering ,",
    "dispersion relations are particularly well suited for this purpose .",
    "if we apply the method to the partial waves obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) , the results for the @xmath3 multipole clearly show a resonant peak , but the asymmetry with respect to the maximum indicates an energy dependence of the background ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : multi_sp ] ) .",
    "this effect may be traced back to the nucleon pole terms . after subtracting these well - defined terms from the amplitudes",
    ", the speed of both @xmath17 and @xmath75 can be well described according to eq .",
    "( [ t_res ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_arg ] shows a comparison of this procedure to the ideal shape of a resonance pole and the resulting argand diagrams for the speed vector . except for the threshold region ,",
    "the differences are almost invisible .",
    "having determined all the resonance parameters , we can now decompose the full amplitudes into contributions of the resonance pole and background terms . as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : uni_m ] , the background is a relatively smooth function of energy without any structure around the resonance .",
    "however , the background is quite large , in particular in the case of the @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "the resonance parameters derived from our analysis are shown in table  [ tab : res_par ] .",
    "it is seen that the pole position @xmath76 mev is in excellent agreement with the results obtained from @xmath45 scattering , @xmath77 mev and @xmath78 mev @xcite .",
    "this agreement may not be very surprising in the case of the largely resonant @xmath75 amplitude , for which there exist earlier investigations to determine the pole position @xcite .",
    "however , it is much less obvious that the interference pattern of re @xmath17 of fig .",
    "[ fig : uni_m ] should lead to the same answer .",
    "the excellent agreement in that case , too , is indeed very satisfactory and shows that the speed plot technique is quite reliable for the extraction of resonance properties .",
    "the table also shows the absolute values and the phases of the resonance residues . because of",
    "the different backgrounds in the two amplitudes , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are different , and the ratio of the resonance amplitudes is complex . the fact that the two  apple shaped  structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_arg ] are essentially oriented in opposite direction is , however , related to the negative value of @xmath56 for the full ( experimental ) amplitude .",
    "concerning the resonance pole contributions alone , we obtain @xmath81    the ratio of the heights of the speed plots is @xmath82 .",
    "we hasten to add , however , that the experimental observable is related to the real part of the ratio ( see eq .",
    "[ r_em ] ) , i.e. the ( unphysical ) case of the resonance without background would lead to @xmath83re@xmath84    as has been mentioned before , the ratio for the full ( experimental ) amplitudes is real below two - pion threshold due to the watson theorem . as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : e_over_m ] , this ratio @xmath85 is strongly dependent on energy , and increases with energy from negative to positive values , e.g. @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . the resonance pole in the complex plane , @xmath89 , and the nonresonant background lead to a @xmath45 phase shift @xmath90 at @xmath91 mev . due to the watson theorem , both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are completely imaginary at this point , and",
    "the ratio can be determined from the experimental data as @xmath92im@xmath93im@xmath94 .",
    "the recent , nearly model - independent value of the mainz group at @xmath95 is @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the method of speed plots can be well applied to analyze the pion photoproduction amplitudes . the resonance pole position of the @xmath8",
    "is obtained from these amplitudes in excellent agreement with the results from pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "the complex residues of the resonance pole terms give information on those parts of the full amplitude that have a resonance  like behaviour .",
    "whether such a contribution originates from a ",
    "bare  resonance or , e.g. from a nonresonant pion production followed by rescattering into a resonant state , is model - dependent @xcite and can not be answered by an analysis of the data but only within the framework of a specific model .    in the future",
    "it will be interesting to analyze double polarization variables , e.g. both photon and recoil or target polarization , because some of these observables turn out to be very sensitive to electric quadrupole radiation , too .",
    "it is also worthwhile pointing out that reactions like @xmath97 yield a longitudinal - transverse interference term (  fifth structure function  ) , which is sensitive to the imaginary part of the interference between the resonant and background multipoles .",
