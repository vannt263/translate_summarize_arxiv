    "consider the seven lines connecting opposite vertices of a cube and of its dual octahedron .",
    "although the symmetry group does not act transitively on the lines , they are exceedingly well distributed within @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we prove that they form a universally optimal configuration ; in other words , they minimize a wide variety of natural notions of energy .",
    "universal optima are rare , and we show that this configuration is the largest universal optimum in @xmath0 .",
    "to prove universal optimality , we use semidefinite programming bounds , which are a powerful technique for proving bounds in coding theory .",
    "we give a new derivation of these bounds and extend them from coding to energy minimization .",
    "proving universal optimality involves challenges that have not arisen in previous applications of semidefinite programming bounds , and we provide a general methodology for meeting these challenges .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that in certain other cases our bounds remain sharp throughout a phase transition between two different ground states , which would be a remarkable phenomenon .",
    "we have not yet been able to prove these conjectures , but the techniques we introduce here represent the first steps in a program to do so .",
    "how can one distribute @xmath1 points as uniformly as possible in a compact metric space @xmath2 with metric @xmath3 ?",
    "there are many possible answers , such as forming a good error - correcting code , i.e. , maximizing the distance between the closest points .",
    "one particularly important family of answers generalizing coding theory is given by potential energy minimization . given a decreasing , continuous function @xmath4 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] called the _ potential function _",
    ", define the _ energy _ of a finite configuration @xmath5 by @xmath6{$\\scriptstyle x , y \\in \\mathcal{c}$\\\\ $ \\scriptstyle x \\ne y$ } } f\\big(d(x , y)^2\\big).\\ ] ] note that the use of squared distance instead of distance is not standard in physics , but it is mathematically convenient ( and of course there is no loss of generality ) .",
    "we wish to choose @xmath7 so as to minimize @xmath8 subject to @xmath9 .",
    "because @xmath10 is decreasing , this amounts to moving the points as far apart as possible , but all the distances matter , not just the minimal distance .",
    "this energy minimization problem arises naturally in physics , as the problem of determining the ground state of a classical particle system with isotropic pair interactions . even in the case of particles confined to two - dimensional surfaces ,",
    "these models capture important features of many real - world materials , such as colloidal particles adsorbing to the surface of a droplet ( see @xcite for details and other examples ) .",
    "small systems frequently display beautiful symmetry , such as twelve particles on a sphere forming the vertices of an icosahedron , but in larger systems the symmetry is often broken by the appearance of defects .",
    "one might expect that these defects would occur only in local minima for energy , and that the global minimum would have a perfect crystalline structure .",
    "sometimes that is the case , but in many systems the defects actually contribute to lowering energy .",
    "( see for example the discussion of spherical crystals in section  3 of @xcite . )",
    "one of the fundamental problems in this area is understanding when highly symmetrical configurations are optimal and why @xcite .",
    "even when the answer is easy to guess , it is usually not easy to prove , and guessing the answer can itself be tricky .",
    "energy minimization can also be viewed as a generalization of coding theory .",
    "specifically , it includes coding theory as a degenerate special case : if we take @xmath11 , then as @xmath12 , the problem of minimizing @xmath8 turns into the problem of maximizing the minimal distance in @xmath7 . the same problem of understanding symmetry occurs here as well : when should one expect an optimal code to be highly symmetrical ?",
    "large or high - dimensional codes are frequently much less highly structured than small codes .",
    "linear programming bounds are a powerful technique for proving lower bounds for energy . in the simplest cases",
    ", they deal with the _ distance distribution _ of the configuration ( in physics terms , the radial pair correlation function ) , which counts how many times each distance occurs between pairs of points . in other words ,",
    "the distance distribution of @xmath7 is the function @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 clearly @xmath15 , @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( note that only finitely many terms are nonzero ) , but we will see that these are far from the only constraints on @xmath19 .",
    "the distance distribution plays a key role because energy is a linear function of @xmath19 : @xmath20 by contrast , the underlying configuration @xmath7 is not always determined by @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "delsarte @xcite realized that in addition to the obvious constraints on @xmath19 mentioned above , there are often many other linear constraints . using these constraints , one can derive bounds on energy via linear programming , because one is optimizing a linear function of @xmath19 subject to linear constraints .",
    "this was first carried out for energy minimization by yudin @xcite .",
    "we refer to them as _ two - point bounds _ because they depend only on the distances between pairs of points .",
    "linear programming bounds are generally not sharp , or even close to sharp , but in certain cases they are unexpectedly powerful .",
    "for example , cohn and kumar @xcite used linear programming bounds to prove that a number of exceptional structures in spheres or projective spaces are universally optimal .",
    "in other words , these configurations minimize energy for all completely monotonic functions of squared euclidean distance on spheres or squared chordal distance in projective space .",
    "( recall that a completely monotonic function is a smooth , nonnegative function whose derivatives alternate in sign : it is decreasing , convex , etc .",
    "for example , inverse power laws are completely monotonic . )",
    "examples include the vertices of any regular polytope with simplicial facets , the @xmath21 root system , or the minimal vectors in the leech lattice .",
    "it is surprising that linear programming bounds are ever sharp , because when they are sharp , pair distance information alone suffices to identify the true ground state .",
    "as one might expect , that is very rarely the case . to prove stronger bounds , it is natural to try to take into account triples as well as pairs (",
    "i.e. , how many times each triangle of distances occurs between three points ) , and schrijver @xcite found the right approach .",
    "the constraints are no longer linear , but rather semidefinite .",
    "bachoc and vallentin @xcite developed a representation - theoretic explanation and extended the method from binary codes to spheres , with an approach that applies also to more general spaces ( and this method was further developed by musin @xcite ) .",
    "these three - point semidefinite programming bounds are one of the most powerful general tools known for proving bounds in coding theory . using them , bachoc and vallentin @xcite determined the optimal @xmath22-point code in @xmath23 , which was the first new optimality proof for a spherical code in decades .",
    "they also conjectured that the bounds are sharp for the optimal @xmath24-point code in @xmath25 ( a square antiprism , first proved optimal by schtte and van der waerden @xcite , so there was less motivation to verify the sharpness in this case ) .      in this paper",
    ", we give a new derivation of the semidefinite programming bounds , which has the advantage of requiring no explicit calculation beyond what is necessary for the linear programming bounds .",
    "we then prove semidefinite bounds for potential energy minimization . using three - point bounds",
    ", we prove universal optimality for a seven - point code in @xmath0 .",
    "it is given by the seven lines through opposite vertices of a cube and its dual octahedron .",
    "equivalently , the lines connect opposite vertices of a rhombic dodecahedron . in the dual picture of planes through the origin in @xmath26 ,",
    "the planes are parallel to the facets of a cuboctahedron ( the dual polyhedron to the rhombic dodecahedron ) .",
    "[ theorem : univopt ] the rhombic dodecahedron code is universally optimal in @xmath0 .",
    "it is globally minimal for energy for each completely monotonic potential function of squared chordal distance , and it is the unique global minimum unless the potential function is a linear function .",
    "it is also the unique optimal seven - point code in @xmath0 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that two - point bounds can not prove theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] .",
    "it was already known that this configuration is an optimal projective code ( i.e. , it maximizes the minimal distance ) , as a consequence of the orthoplex bound of conway , hardin , and sloane @xcite .",
    "uniqueness was conjectured in @xcite but does not follow from the orthoplex bound ; see appendix  [ appendix : orthoplex ] for an explanation .",
    "note that the uniqueness asserted in theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] is as strong as possible : for linear potential functions , uniqueness fails because one can rotate the cube and octahedron relative to each other ( so they are no longer in dual position ) without changing the energy . that can be checked directly , but conceptually it holds because both polyhedra already define projective @xmath27-designs . more generally , @xmath28-designs automatically minimize potential energy for completely monotonic polynomials of degree at most @xmath28 .",
    "one noteworthy aspect of the rhombic dodecahedron code is that it is the first case in which linear or semidefinite programming bounds are sharp for a code that is not distance regular . in other words",
    ", there is a distance such that the points in the code do not all have the same number of neighbors at that distance .",
    "all universal optima known or conjectured so far have been distance regular , so this example is the least regular one known .",
    "theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] thus extends the types of configurations that can be analyzed rigorously .",
    "we have searched extensively for other cases in which the three - point semidefinite programming bounds are sharp ( in spheres , real projective spaces , and complex projective spaces ) , but the rhombic dodecahedron is the only new case we have found",
    ". it would be very surprising if it were the only example in projective space , and we think there must be others .",
    "however , our failure to find them suggests that they are either large or high - dimensional . in the process of searching for other examples",
    ", we have formulated several remarkable conjectures about semidefinite programming bounds ( conjectures  [ conjecture : petersen ] through  [ conjecture : univ ] ) : in the few sharp cases that are known , the bounds appear to remain sharp even all the way through a phase transition between two different structures .",
    "theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] provides the last remaining universal optimum in @xmath0 :    [ theorem : classify ] the complete list of universally optimal line configurations in @xmath26 ( up to isometry ) is as follows :",
    "1 .   up to three orthogonal lines .",

    "code _ is simply a finite subset of a metric space .",
    "it is _ optimal _ if it maximizes the minimal distance between points , given the number of points and the metric space .",
    "an @xmath29 _ spherical code _ is a set of @xmath1 points in the unit sphere @xmath30 such that the maximal inner product between distinct points is at most @xmath31 .",
    "( in other words , the minimal angle between them is at least @xmath32 . )",
    "an _ antipodal code _ is a spherical code that is closed under multiplication by @xmath33 .",
    "real projective codes are of course equivalent to antipodal codes , and the rhombic dodecahedron code corresponds to a @xmath34 antipodal code .",
    "( note that the vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron do not lie on a common sphere , so they must be rescaled to form this code . )    the _ chordal metric _ is defined on real , complex , or quaternionic projective space as follows ( in the octonionic case it is defined using the frobenius norm on the exceptional jordan algebra ; see @xcite ) .",
    "if we represent points in projective space by unit vectors , then the chordal distance between @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the hermitian inner product .",
    "this metric , first introduced in @xcite , is equivalent to the fubini - study metric but is in many ways more convenient .",
    "a code in a sphere or projective space is _ universally optimal _ if it minimizes the energy @xmath39 for all completely monotonic potential functions @xmath10 ( compared to all other codes of the same size ) , with the metric chosen to be the euclidean metric on spheres or the chordal metric on projective spaces .",
    "recall that distance is squared in the definition of @xmath39 .",
    "this strengthens the notion of universal optimality , compared to defining it with unsquared distance , and it improves the connections with topics such as spherical or projective designs .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "let @xmath40 denote the degree @xmath28 ultraspherical ( i.e. , gegenbauer ) polynomial for @xmath30 , normalized with @xmath41 .",
    "( this is not the most common notation . )",
    "these polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the measure @xmath42 on @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "see chapters  6 and  9 of @xcite for more details .    in the literature , two - point bounds",
    "are typically referred to as linear programming bounds and three - point bounds as semidefinite programming bounds .",
    "these names are a reasonable reference to the underlying inequalities , but we propose calling them `` @xmath28-point bounds , '' which focuses attention on the most geometrically relevant feature , namely the number of points being simultaneously considered .    given a matrix @xmath44 , we write @xmath45 if @xmath44 is hermitian ( i.e. , it equals its own conjugate transpose ) and positive semidefinite .",
    "the inner product on hermitian matrices is defined by @xmath46 ( i.e. , the entry - by - entry hermitian inner product ) , and angle brackets will also denote the usual inner product on vectors .",
    "we will use @xmath47 to denote a matrix with all entries @xmath27 .",
    "when we deal with points in real projective space @xmath48 , we will represent each point by an arbitrary lift to the double cover @xmath30 . that introduces sign ambiguities ,",
    "so we must ensure that all formulas are invariant under the choice of the lift .",
    "for example , if we apply a function to the inner product between two points , then it should be an even function .",
    "linear and semidefinite programming bounds are based on the theory of positive - definite kernels .",
    "let @xmath49 be a topological group acting continuously on a topological space @xmath2 . call a continuous function @xmath50 a _ _ positive - definite kernel _ _ a positive - semidefinite kernel , but unfortunately this terminology is too well established to be easily changed . ]",
    "if for all @xmath51 and all @xmath52 , the @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 is hermitian and positive semidefinite .",
    "( of course , saying it is hermitian simply means that @xmath55 for all @xmath56 . )",

    "in fact , every such kernel arises in this way :    [ theorem : pdk ] for every @xmath49-invariant positive - definite kernel @xmath65 on @xmath2 , there exists a unitary representation @xmath59 of @xmath49 and a continuous , @xmath49-equivariant map @xmath61 such that @xmath66 for all @xmath56 .",
    "this theorem is a variant of a characterization of positive - definite kernels due to bochner @xcite .",

    "let @xmath67 be the complex vector space formally spanned by the points of @xmath2 , and define a form @xmath68 on @xmath67 by setting @xmath69 for @xmath56 and extending linearly in the first coordinate and conjugate linearly in the second .",
    "the action of @xmath49 on @xmath2 extends to an action of @xmath49 on @xmath67 .    because @xmath65 is a @xmath49-invariant positive - definite kernel ,",

    "let @xmath73 be the obvious map ( the composition of the trivial embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath67 , the quotient map by @xmath70 , and the embedding in the completion ) .",
    "then @xmath74 is continuous and @xmath49-equivariant , and @xmath75 for all @xmath56 .    to complete the proof , we just need to verify that @xmath59 is a unitary representation of @xmath49 . in other words",
    ", for each @xmath76 , the map @xmath77 must be a continuous function from @xmath49 to @xmath59 . by @xmath49-invariance it suffices to verify continuity at @xmath78 .",

    "then @xmath84 by the continuity of @xmath65 and the action of @xmath49 on @xmath2 , the finitely many terms on the right side with nonvanishing coefficients can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath85 close to the identity .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is indeed a unitary representation of @xmath49 .    if @xmath59 splits into an orthogonal direct sum @xmath86 as a representation of @xmath49 , then each corresponding kernel @xmath65 splits as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 correspond to the subrepresentations @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "suppose that @xmath49 is compact .",
    "then by the peter - weyl theorem , every unitary representation of @xmath49 is an orthogonal direct sum of finite - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "thus , the cone of @xmath49-invariant positive - definite kernels is spanned by those arising from irreducible representations .",
    "when @xmath49 acts transitively on @xmath2 , we can identify @xmath2 with @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the stabilizer of a point @xmath94 .",
    "then a @xmath49-equivariant map @xmath61 is completely determined by @xmath95 via @xmath96 , and @xmath95 can be any vector in @xmath59 that is fixed by @xmath93 .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath97 is a gelfand pair : then the fixed space @xmath98 has dimension at most @xmath27 when @xmath59 is irreducible , so each irreducible representation is associated with at most one positive - definite kernel ( up to scaling ) .",
    "this occurs , for example , when @xmath2 is a sphere , projective space , or grassmannian and @xmath49 is the group of isometries of @xmath2 .    when the fixed space @xmath98 has dimension greater than @xmath27 , the situation is more complicated .",

    "it is not guaranteed that this rounding process will work : the problem is the semidefinite constraints , because unexpected zero eigenvalues may become negative due to the rounding .",
    "however , we do not run into that difficulty , because there turn out to be no zero eigenvalues except for the ones forced by the constraints we have built into our basis .",

    "it follows that it is the rhombic dodecahedron code .",
    "finally , for uniqueness as a spherical code , we use @xmath410 .",
    "every code whose minimal distance is as large as the rhombic dodecahedron code s minimal distance has @xmath411 , and hence it minimizes @xmath277 ( because the minimal energy is @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus , uniqueness for this potential function implies uniqueness as a spherical code .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] .",
    "one pressing question is why three - point bounds are not sharp more often .",
    "of course , it is unreasonable to expect that sharp bounds will ever be common in packing or energy minimization problems .",
    "the phenomena seem to be intrinsically complicated ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and the most one can hope for is to prove optimality in exceptional cases",
    ". however , even just for spheres , the two - point bounds are sharp for three infinite families and a dozen sporadic cases ( see table  1 in @xcite ) , and they are sharp even more often in projective spaces .",
    "thus , it is surprising that only three sharp cases are known for three - point bounds , excluding the cases where two - point bounds already suffice .",
    "surely there must be more examples , but so far we have not been able to find them .",
    "it is natural to ask what sort of bounds are required to prove optimality for an @xmath1-point configuration .",
    "of course @xmath1-point bounds suffice , but only because in the process of optimizing over @xmath1-point distributions they implicitly optimize over all @xmath1-point configurations . for what sorts of families of configurations might @xmath412-point bounds suffice",
    "?    it would also be very interesting to do explicit calculations with four - point bounds .",
    "this project would involve exceptionally time - consuming calculations , but it is possible in principle and perhaps in practice .",
    "gijswijt , mittelmann , and schrijver have carried out the analogue for binary error - correcting codes @xcite , which suggests that the continuous version may also be tractable .    if we had further examples of sharp three - point bounds , they might suggest organizing principles that could lead to a deeper understanding .",
    "for example , for two - point bounds in two - point homogeneous spaces , levenshtein @xcite proved a beautiful criterion for being an optimal code in terms of strength as a design : any @xmath161-distance set that is a @xmath413-design ( or even an antipodal @xmath414-design ) is an optimal code . in these cases ,",
    "the two - point bounds are sharp and can be understood conceptually , with no need for numerical calculations .",
    "the same criterion applies more generally to prove universal optimality ( theorems  1.2 and  8.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "every known case in which two - point bounds are sharp fits into this framework , with one exception , namely the regular @xmath336-cell @xcite .",
    "we can not even propose a conjectural generalization of levenshtein s criterion to three - point bounds .",
    "however , we hope that some general principle will explain the sharp cases , offer guidance for how to locate more of them , and lead to proofs that involve no explicit numerical computations .",
    "another question is whether there are good applications of three - point bounds to potential functions that depend on triples of points , rather than pairs .",
    "of course , there is no obstacle to writing down such bounds , but it is not clear that there are any exciting examples .",
    "pair potentials are far more common in physics , and we do not know which higher - order generalizations may be worthy of investigation .      theorem  [ theorem : classify ] settles the question of universal optimality in @xmath0 , but as we will see in subsection  [ subsec : spheres ] , there may be cases in which three - point bounds are sharp but universal optimality does not hold .",
    "we are unaware of any cases in projective space besides the rhombic dodecahedron code in which three - point bounds are sharp and two - point bounds are not , but it is difficult to imagine that it is the only example .",
    "it is especially intriguing that the three - point bounds prove universal optimality for this code , and it would be fascinating to find other such cases .",
    "it is unlikely that there are any in @xmath415 .",
    "in addition to the universal optima that occur in every dimension ( up to @xmath203 orthogonal lines in @xmath165 , or @xmath416 connecting the vertices of a regular simplex to its centroid ) , there are at least two other universally optimal line configurations in @xmath417 : @xmath418 lines through opposite vertices of a regular @xmath419-cell and @xmath420 from a regular @xmath336-cell . in each of these cases , universal optimality follows from two - point bounds : the last one can be proved using the techniques from section  7 of @xcite , and all the others follow from theorem  8.2 in @xcite . we know of no other candidates for universal optimality in @xmath415 .",
    "five - dimensional line configurations are more promising . in addition to the generic cases of up to six lines , two - point bounds prove universal optimality for a ten - line configuration from @xcite ( by theorem  8.2 in @xcite ) . in the subspace of @xmath421 consisting of all points with coordinate sum zero ,",
    "this configuration consists of the lines through all the permutations of @xmath422 .",
    "if we include also the lines through the permutations of @xmath423 , we get a @xmath424-line configuration also studied in @xcite .",
    "the orthoplex bound is sharp for it , so it is an optimal projective code , but nothing more is known about energy minimization or uniqueness .",
    "[ conjecture:16in5 ] the @xmath424-line configuration in @xmath425 described above is universally optimal and is the unique optimal @xmath424-point code in @xmath426 .",
    "the parallels between this code and the rhombic dodecahedron code are noteworthy .",
    "the seven lines in @xmath26 can be constructed completely analogously , using the permutations of the points @xmath427 and @xmath428 .",
    "equivalently , both codes can be constructed by starting with the lines through the vertices of a regular simplex centered at the origin , and then filling in all the holes ( i.e. , the lines at maximal distance from the original lines ) .",
    "both codes can be proved optimal using the orthoplex bound .",
    "nevertheless , the three - point bounds for potential energy do not seem to settle conjecture  [ conjecture:16in5 ] , although they suffice to prove theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] .",
    "perhaps four - point bounds can prove conjecture  [ conjecture:16in5 ] , but the calculations required to investigate this could be formidable .",
    "the pattern certainly does not continue to @xmath429 : the analogous configuration has @xmath430 lines , but comparison with table  4 from @xcite shows that it is not even an optimal projective code .",
    "although in this paper we focus on real projective space , we have also applied three - point bounds to potential energy minimization on spheres .",
    "we have not found any sharp cases beyond the two identified by bachoc and vallentin @xcite , namely the petersen code in @xmath417 ( the ten edge midpoints of a regular simplex ) and the square antiprism in @xmath26 . using three - point bounds",
    ", they proved rigorously that the petersen code is an optimal code , and based on their calculations they conjectured that the bounds are also sharp for the antiprism .    for ten points in @xmath23",
    ", we observe a remarkable phenomenon in the three - point bounds for energy .",
    "the petersen code is not universally optimal , because it sometimes has greater potential energy than the code consisting of two regular pentagons on orthogonal planes in @xmath417 .",
    "however , the three - point bounds appear to be sharp in every case :    [ conjecture : petersen ] for every completely monotonic potential function @xmath10 on @xmath431 $ ] , either the petersen code or the orthogonal pentagon code minimizes the energy @xmath39 among all ten - point codes in @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the three - point bounds are always sharp ( for whichever code is optimal ) .    in other words ,",
    "the three - point bounds remain sharp throughout the phase transition between the two ground states .",
    "if true , this represents an unprecedented phenomenon in coding and energy minimization .",
    "we believe that conjecture  [ conjecture : petersen ] should be provable , although we have not been able to complete a proof .",
    "the cone of completely monotonic functions on @xmath431 $ ] is spanned by the functions @xmath432 ( see theorem  9b in @xcite ) . for @xmath433 , both codes have the same energy and the two - point bounds are sharp . for @xmath434 ,",
    "the three - point bounds are sharp for the orthogonal pentagons , and for @xmath435 we can prove that they are sharp for the petersen code ( by using the spherical analogue of corollary  [ corollary : reduce ] to reduce to a finite basis ) . to prove conjecture  [ conjecture : petersen ] , it would suffice to prove it just for the functions @xmath436 with @xmath437 and @xmath435 , where @xmath438 is chosen to make the two codes have equal energy .",
    "unfortunately , we have found it much more difficult to deal with these cases .",
    "the same phenomenon as in conjecture  [ conjecture : petersen ] seems to occur also for antiprisms . in that case",
    ", there is a one - parameter family of configurations .",
    "each consists of two squares in parallel planes and offset by a @xmath439 angle , but the distance between the planes can vary .    [",
    "conjecture : antiprism ] for every completely monotonic potential function @xmath10 on @xmath431 $ ] , some square antiprism minimizes the energy @xmath39 among all eight - point codes in @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the three - point bounds are always sharp ( for whichever code is optimal ) .",
    "because this conjecture involves a continuous family of optima , it may be more difficult to prove than conjecture  [ conjecture : petersen ] .",
    "it seems to require a new idea beyond what suffices for theorem  [ theorem : univopt ] and our partial progress on conjecture  [ conjecture : petersen ] .",
    "the dependence of the optimal energy on the potential function is also extraordinarily complicated , because of the need to optimize over all square antiprisms .",
    "for example , for the coulomb potential , the minimal energy within the family of antiprisms is a root of an irreducible polynomial of degree @xmath440 .",
    "these conjectures suggest a broad generalization of the mechanism behind the known proofs of universal optimality :    [ conjecture : univ ] suppose @xmath2 is a sphere or projective space , @xmath7 is a finite subset of @xmath2 , and @xmath10 is a completely monotonic function other than a polynomial . if @xmath28-point bounds prove that @xmath7 optimizes energy under @xmath10 ( or prove that @xmath7 is an optimal code ) , then for every completely monotonic potential function , @xmath28-point bounds will prove a sharp bound for energy for @xmath152 points in @xmath2 , although @xmath7 may not itself be optimal .    for low - degree polynomials ,",
    "there are numerous counterexamples : for example , for each spherical @xmath28-design , two - point bounds prove that it is optimal for @xmath432 .",
    "however , that is the only loophole we have found .",
    "conjecture  [ conjecture : univ ] is very strong , and perhaps we have been misled by the few known examples with @xmath441 .",
    "it may hold in these examples merely because the optimal structures are in some sense of comparable complexity .",
    "however , conjecture  [ conjecture : univ ] seems to be the simplest explanation of the available evidence .",
    "the most dramatic test case will be @xmath419 points in @xmath23 .",
    "the vertices of a regular @xmath419-cell are almost certainly the unique optimal code , but they are not universally optimal @xcite . instead , there is a one - parameter family of competing configurations that improve on the @xmath419-cell for some potential functions .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that either the @xmath419-cell or one of these competitors is always optimal .",
    "if that is true , and conjecture  [ conjecture : univ ] is true as well , then @xmath28-point bounds can not settle the optimality of the @xmath419-cell without also dealing with its more exotic competitors . if they can accomplish both with a small value of @xmath28 , it will be truly remarkable .",
    "we thank christine bachoc , abhinav kumar , and frank vallentin for helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we explain the orthoplex bound from @xcite in somewhat different terms than those used there ( although it is essentially the same approach ) , and we discuss some examples and generalizations .",
    "the orthoplex bound applies to codes in any grassmannian , but for real projective space it is particularly simple .",
    "it is based on the map from @xmath165 to its symmetric square @xmath442 that takes @xmath35 to @xmath443 . under the natural inner product on @xmath442 , @xmath444 .",
    "let @xmath445 be an orthonormal basis of @xmath165 , and let @xmath446 .",
    "then for all @xmath447 , @xmath448 .",
    "thus , the unit sphere @xmath30 is mapped into the cross section of the unit sphere in @xmath442 that has inner product @xmath27 with the vector @xmath264 ( note that @xmath449 ) .    for @xmath450 ,",
    "define @xmath451 .",
    "( in other words , start with @xmath452 , project orthogonally to @xmath264 , and rescale to get a unit vector . )",
    "then @xmath453 and @xmath454 , which implies that @xmath455 if and only if @xmath456 . the image of @xmath74 is orthogonal to @xmath264 and is thus contained in the unit sphere of a euclidean space of @xmath457 dimensions .    under @xmath74 , an @xmath29 antipodal code is mapped to an @xmath458 spherical code .",
    "thus , any bound on such spherical codes yields a bound on the original antipodal code .",
    "linear programming bounds are useless in this context , because any positive - definite function on the higher - dimensional sphere pulls back under @xmath74 to a positive - definite function on @xmath30 ( so there is no need to apply @xmath74 in the first place )",
    ". however , other bounds may prove fruitful .",
    "for example , for @xmath459 , no @xmath28-point code in @xmath460 can achieve an angle of better than @xmath461 ( see @xcite or theorem  6.2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that when @xmath462 , no @xmath1-point antipodal code in @xmath30 can have maximal inner product less than @xmath463 , since otherwise its image under @xmath74 would have maximal inner product less than @xmath71 .",
    "this is the orthoplex bound for projective codes .",
    "it is not obvious that the orthoplex bound is ever sharp , but in fact it is sharp in several important cases , for example when @xmath464 these cases are all taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath465 case is of course the optimality as a projective code of the rhombic dodecahedron .",
    "another noteworthy case is @xmath466 with @xmath203 a power of @xmath467 ( which generalizes the @xmath468 case ) , due to levenshtein @xcite . in this case",
    ", the orthoplex bound shows that optimality still holds when up to @xmath469 lines are omitted .",
    "unfortunately , the orthoplex bound does not imply uniqueness .",
    "one problem is that when @xmath470 , there are continuous families of spherical codes with maximal inner product @xmath71 . to prove uniqueness",
    ", one would have to determine which such codes are in the image of @xmath74 , which seems to be a subtle question . even when @xmath471 , the image of @xmath74 is uniquely determined up to isometries of the sphere containing it , but it does not obviously follow that the original code is also unique .    uniqueness is not merely difficult to prove , but in fact sometimes false .",
    "for example , the unique @xmath472 antipodal code is the regular @xmath419-cell ( uniqueness follows easily from the two - point bounds ) .",
    "as one can see in the list of examples above , the orthoplex bound proves not only that it is optimal , but also that removing one pair of antipodal points still yields an optimal antipodal code of size @xmath473 .",
    "however , that is not the only @xmath474 antipodal code .",
    "another one is given by the vertices @xmath475 of a cube , a pair @xmath476 of points",
    "antipodal to all of them , and the two octahedra @xmath477 in the @xmath478-dimensional affine subspaces with fourth coordinate @xmath479 or @xmath480 .",
    "this example , which appears to be new , is a @xmath474 antipodal code that is not contained in the @xmath419-cell , because inner products of @xmath406 and @xmath481 occur .",
    "we do not know of any other @xmath474 antipodal codes , but we have not searched thoroughly enough to be confident that no others exist .",
    "note that the second gegenbauer polynomial @xmath482 for @xmath30 is given by @xmath483 .",
    "thus , the map @xmath74 satisfies @xmath484 .",
    "this is not a coincidence , and in fact the orthoplex bound can be generalized to substitute any positive - definite function @xmath10 for @xmath482 , if it is normalized to satisfy @xmath485 . for individual gegenbauer polynomials",
    "this follows immediately from the reproducing kernel property ( see subsection  2.2 of @xcite for a review of the theory ) , and nonnegative linear combinations can be obtained by taking direct sums of the corresponding spaces .",
    "unfortunately , we have been unable to find any cases other than @xmath486 that lead to sharp bounds on antipodal or general spherical codes .",
    "the proof of completeness for the list in theorem  [ theorem : classify ] is based on a theorem of leech @xcite . he classified balanced configurations in @xmath25 , i.e. , point configurations that are in equilibrium for every pairwise force law depending only on distance .",
    "equivalently , in the space of configurations they are stationary points for energy for every potential function .",
    "this is a necessary condition for universal optimality in @xmath25 , and for universal optimality in @xmath0 it is necessary that the corresponding antipodal configuration in @xmath25 be balanced .",
    "( if it is not balanced , then the net forces inherit the antipodal symmetry and descend to projective space . )",
    "one obvious balanced configuration is a ring of equally spaced points around the equator , and it remains balanced if one includes the north and south poles as well .",
    "in addition , each regular polyhedron gives several balanced configurations .",
    "its vertices , face centers , and edge midpoints each form a balanced configuration , and every combination of them ( vertices and faces , vertices and edges , all three , etc . )",
    "is also balanced when they are rescaled to lie on the same sphere .",
    "leech proved that this list of balanced configurations in @xmath25 is complete .",
    "by contrast , the high - dimensional case is not so simple , and there exist balanced configurations with no symmetry at all @xcite .    to classify the universal optima in @xmath0 , one need only examine the antipodal balanced configurations in @xmath25 .",
    "the cases with a ring around the equator are easily dealt with : whenever the ring has more than four points in it and the potential function is sufficiently steep , one can lower the energy by moving one point slightly off the equator ( and of course moving the antipodal point correspondingly ) .",
    "the only difficulty is dealing with the finitely many cases that come from regular polyhedra .",
    ".balanced configurations that must be eliminated . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ table : polyhedra ] shows a list of the cases that must be eliminated .",
    "it omits the actual universal optima from theorem  [ theorem : classify ] as well as any duplicate cases ( for example , from duality ) .",
    "the first four columns specify the polyhedron , which combination of vertices , edges , and faces is being used , the number @xmath1 of lines , and the cosine of the minimal angle between them .",
    "the final column tells the smallest such cosine known for a configuration of this size , from table  1 in @xcite . in every case except @xmath487 , the record from @xcite is better than the balanced configuration , which is therefore not universally optimal since it is not even an optimal projective code .",
    "however , the balanced configuration with @xmath487 is probably an optimal code .    nevertheless , the @xmath487 case is not universally optimal .",
    "it is a @xmath488-design in @xmath0 but not a @xmath478-design .",
    "however , a @xmath424-point @xmath478-design exists : it is equivalent to an antipodal @xmath489-point spherical @xmath371-design in @xmath25 , and such a design is constructed in section  4 of @xcite .",
    "it follows that the @xmath424-line configuration is not universally optimal , and hence the list in theorem  [ theorem : classify ] is complete .",
    "the @xmath490 vertices of the regular @xmath336-cell are universally optimal in @xmath23 .",
    "section  7 of @xcite describes a construction that applies two - point bounds for energy .",
    "it gives a sharp bound for every absolutely monotonic potential function , and in any given case it is easy to check that it works , but the proof that it works for every potential function is fairly elaborate .",
    "we will use corollary  [ corollary : reduce ] ( or , technically , its analogue for spheres ) to reduce the problem to a finite calculation .",
    "there are eight inner products between distinct points in the @xmath336-cell , namely @xmath33 , @xmath71 , @xmath491 , and @xmath492 .",
    "call them @xmath493 with @xmath494 let @xmath274 be the multiset @xmath495 ( note that @xmath496 )",
    ". now corollary  [ corollary : reduce ] reduces the problem to a finite number of cases . in each case but the last , it is not hard to check that the approach in section  7 of @xcite proves a sharp bound , but it fails in the last case , namely @xmath497 the failure does not come as a surprise , because of course this function is not absolutely monotonic .",
    "nevertheless , the approach can be salvaged in this case . in the language used at the top of page  127 in @xcite",
    ", one should choose an auxiliary polynomial of degree @xmath498 that agrees with @xmath10 to order @xmath488 at @xmath33 ( in addition to the other conditions listed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that this polynomial proves a sharp bound for @xmath211 .",
    "this proof is still not exactly conceptual , because it relies on a fair amount of computation , but it requires less computation and is substantially simpler than the proof in @xcite .",
    "the same approach of using the spherical analogue of corollary  [ corollary : reduce ] works for all the universal optima studied in @xcite ; in fact , it is in a sense equivalent to the approach used there , but this method was not made explicit in @xcite and was not applied to the @xmath336-cell .",
