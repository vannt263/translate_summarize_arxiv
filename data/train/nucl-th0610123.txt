    "@xmath86    @xmath87    leading to the equation @xmath88      the equation can be approximated by the following one @xmath89    therefore , neglecting the backward amplitudes , i.e. setting @xmath90 , immediately reduces to the secular equation obtained earlier @xcite : @xmath91    the significant difference for the solution @xmath92 of the equation as compared to the equation comes from the second term in the r.h.s . of the expression which contributes to a shift of the first solution of equation to higher energies .",
    "the second term of the r.h.s . of equation also contributes in the same direction but to a much smaller extent .",
    "the shift in energy becomes larger as the interaction between the quasiparticles and phonons increases . a critical value for the interaction exists as in but now due to the second type of terms in @xmath93 an increase in the interaction leads to a shift of the first solution towards the pole as contrary to the case neglecting backward amplitudes where the solution moves in the opposite direction .",
    "the inclusion of the matrix element @xmath82 in the system of equations can be accounted as a change of @xmath94 to @xmath95 but the resulting shift in the first solution turns out to be negligible .",
    "in order to give a qualitative picture of the effects on the structure of the low - lying states imposed by the backward - going amplitudes , numerical calculations for @xmath0ba were performed .",
    "this isotope belongs to the transitional region where the anharmonic effects play a gradually increasing role at low and mainly at intermediate energies and therefore the results presented in this section may lack some accuracy because the wave function does not contain configurations to account for these effects .",

    "the strength parameters @xmath6 are adjusted so that the odd energy spectrum of the low - lying states is reasonably close to the experimental values . as a result , the energy of the first quadrupole state of @xmath106ba has a value that is much higher than the experimental one .        solving the systems of equations",
    ", one can find the structure of the wave functions and the energies of the excited states . working in a diagonal approximation for @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath107 this system reduces to a generalized eigenvalue problem . in fig.1",
    "a comparison between the experimental values of the energies and the theoretical calculations is presented .",
    "we restrict the calculation to the six neutron states @xmath108 .",
    "the level ordering presented in the third column on this figure generally agrees with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results clearly support the conclusion following from as the first solutions obtained after the inclusion of the backward - going terms become closer to the first poles and consequently closer to the second solution thus significantly reducing the gap between the first @xmath109 and the second @xmath109 states as well as between the first @xmath110 and the second @xmath110 states .",
    "the intruder state @xmath111 deserves a special attention .",
    "the wave function of this state is practically a pure quasiparticle@xmath49phonon state with a structure @xmath112_{9/2 ^ -}$ ] .",
    "the significant reduction of the energy of this state is due to the pauli principle correction , the inclusion of which is essential for the correct ordering of the first several levels . along with the experimental energies our calculations provide a reasonable description of the spectroscopic factors for the @xmath113-reactions : for the states @xmath114 and @xmath115 having experimentally measured values of the spectroscopic factors of @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively , our calculations give @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the comparison between theoretical calculations and experimental data for @xmath0ba has shown that in order to describe the structure of the low - lying states in odd - mass nuclei far from the magic numbers one needs to take into account the pauli principle and the ground state correlations effects simultaneously .",
