    "we consider timelike maximal surfaces in a three dimensional vacuum spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "these surfaces are usually referred to as relativistic strings in the literature .    the case of non - compact timelike maximal graphs in minkowski spacetimes",
    "@xmath2 is fairly well understood .",
    "global well - posedness for sufficiently small initial data was established by brendle @xcite and by lindblad @xcite .",
    "the case of general codimension was studied by allen , andersson and isenberg @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is in the case where the surface is an immersed cylinder @xmath3 , or a string , in @xmath0 .",
    "we note that local well - posedness for this problem in a larger context was studied recently by allen , andersson and restuccia @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , bellettini , hoppe , novaga and orlandi showed that the problem for a relativistic string in a flat spacetime can be simplified considerably in the so - called orthogonal gauge .",
    "in fact , the authors effectively reduced the problem to a homogeneous linear wave equation in one dimension , which admits a simple representation formula from its initial data , which implies in particular the long time existence of parametrizations for relativistic strings . as a consequence",
    ", they showed , among other results , that if the initial curve is a centrally symmetric convex curve and the initial velocity is zero , the string shrinks to a point in finite time .",
    "( it should be noted that the string does not become extinct there , but rather comes out of the singularity point , evolves back to its original shape and then periodically afterwards . )",
    "we also note an earlier paper by kibble and turok @xcite which showed that a closed string with zero initial velocity must form singularity in finite time .    by a different method , kong and his collaborators @xcite and",
    "@xcite proved another representation formula ( without the need to fix a gauge ) . using their representation formula",
    ", they presented many numerical evidences where singularity formation is prominent .    from the above discussion",
    "( see also @xcite ) , it is suggestive that , for any arbitrary initial data , a closed string must form singularity in finite time .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to confirm this statement .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the three dimensional minkowski spacetime endowed with the flat metric , and @xmath4 its standard cartesian coordinates .",
    "we prove :    [ main1 ] for any smooth immersed closed curve @xmath5 and smooth future - directed timelike and nowhere vanishing vector field @xmath6 along @xmath7 , there exists no globally smooth immersed surface @xmath8 which contains @xmath7 and tangential to @xmath6 such that its induced metric is lorentzian and its mean curvature vector vanishes .",
    "equivalently , the above result asserts that if one evolves a closed curve in @xmath0 in a timelike direction such that its mean curvature is zero , it will form singularity in finite time . on the other hand ,",
    "since the pde for the parametrization map admits a global solution , it makes sense to talk about the `` maximal surface '' after singularity forms . in section [ sec : locpic ] , we give a detailed study of the local geometry of a maximal surface at a generic singularity . for a generic singularity propagation",
    ", we shows that , locally , the time slices of the maximal surface evolve by a rigid motion : they are either translated or rotated ( see figure [ persing ] ) . for a generic singularity formation , we show that it is locally self - similar .",
    "self - similar singularity formation was classified by eggers and hoppe @xcite .",
    "locally , the singularities look like a swallowtail : the first singularity is a cusp of order @xmath9 which splits up to two ordinary cusps at later time ( see figure [ swtailsing ] ) .    as a partial complement to the above theorem",
    ", we also establish in proposition [ prop : lbexistencetime ] a lower bound for the existence time before singularity forms .",
    "our estimate implies , for example , that if @xmath10 is a non - compact curve in @xmath11 such that its total absolute curvature is smaller than one - half , then there is a ( possibly immersed ) regular timelike maximal surface in @xmath0 containing @xmath10 and perpendicular to @xmath11 .    in general vacuum spacetimes ,",
    "the question of how singularities form is less clear .",
    "however , using ode techniques for proving blow - up results of semilinear wave equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we can prove the following result , which implies a singularity statement in @xmath0 when the initial curve is convex in @xmath11 and the normal velocity vector is parallel along the initial curve .",

    ", we give a construction of a regular ( two - dimensional ) timelike cylindrical maximal surface in @xmath17 .",
