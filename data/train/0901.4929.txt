    "large - scale coherent magnetic fields are observed in many spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that a turbulent dynamo process is responsible for the sustained amplification of the mean magnetic field within galaxies .",
    "the turbulence driven by supernova explosions together with the differential rotation should in fact lead to the action of the classical @xmath0  dynamo @xcite .",
    "first steps to globally model flat objects in an ellipsoidal geometry were done by @xcite .",
    "starting from the early nineties , first multidimensional numerical mean - field models assuming a disk geometry appeared @xcite .",
    "these models applied simple estimates for the turbulent transport coefficients in the mean - field induction equation .",
    "@xcite , in the framework of second order correlation approximation ( soca ) , derived the full @xmath1  tensor and turbulent diffusivity for stratified turbulence .",
    "@xcite , under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , computed the turbulent velocity distribution @xmath2 based on the observed density stratification and an observationally motivated gravitational potential from stars and dark matter .",
    "applying soca theory , one could now specify the full @xmath1  tensor , resulting in a model with the correlation time @xmath3 of the turbulence as the only free parameter .    with the increased computer power of the nineties , @xcite and @xcite , in an alternative approach , computed the turbulence coefficients by averaging the results from simulations of a single supernova remnant .",
    "it , however , turned out that the values from isolated explosions were about one magnitude smaller then the estimated numbers from the previous considerations .",
    "similar results , based on semi - analytical models , were obtained by @xcite .",
    "extending the investigation to super - bubbles and including the stratification of the ism , she finally found turbulence coefficients of expected magnitude .",
    "however , with a huge escape velocity , which could switch off the dynamo process .",
    "@xcite used these results as input for an axisymmetric dynamo model of our galaxy .",
    "they reached growth times of about @xmath4 but with a ten times larger toroidal field than the radial component , i.e. , with a rather low pitch angle .",
    "a lot of models , but mostly axisymmetric , were published during that period .",
    "most of the models were investigating different aspects of the turbulence , looking also for parameters where non - axisymmetric solutions could appear .",
    "another application was the effect of radial flows on the dynamo properties driven by the maxwell stress of the dynamo generated magnetic field .",
    "models including a wind were investigated , especially to explain vertical fields above the disk ",
    "notably @xcite . both models used different assumptions about the halo diffusivity and the wind structure . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "diamagnetism was included , and because of the positive turbulence gradient , the pumping was not an escape velocity but an inward transport term . in @xcite , a passive halo with low conductivity was assumed .",
    "these models already showed a fast growth time below @xmath5 .",
    "all these models could in principle explain the main features of the observed magnetic fields in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "but the connection between optical and magnetic spirals was still unclear .    with the advent of the new century , full - blown 3d models became feasible , and one could now attack the spiral structure .",
    "simple artificial velocity models adopted from density - wave theory were now taken into account .",
    "one spectacular observational result was the anti - correlation of optical and magnetic arms , found by @xcite .",
    "a turbulent dynamo could reproduce such a behaviour due to the different properties of the turbulence in the spiral arms and in the inter - arm regions ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more elaborated models used the velocity from numerical galaxy models computed with sph or sticky - particle methods @xcite .",
    "models for spiral galaxies produced no inter - arm fields by the large - scale spiral motion alone . only with a variation of the turbulence , one could have inter - arm fields .",
    "the situation was different for bar galaxies @xcite .",
    "in these simulations , one could observe inter - arm magnetic fields in the outer spiral arm , and the field lagged behind the optical arm ( * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite conducted models for barred galaxies with stationary flows .",
    "another problem was raised in the context of the so - called catastrophic quenching : because of helicity conservation , in the ideal mhd case , the @xmath1  term will be quenched ( with the square - root of the magnetic reynolds number ) if there is no additional transport of magnetic helicity in the box .",
    "under the assumption of a galactic wind or fountain flow , these problems may disappear .",
    "but a too strong wind would also result in a suppression of the dynamo @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have shown that already the galactic shear flow can suppress the catastrophic quenching of the dynamo @xcite .",
    "the recent box model of the turbulent ism driven by multiple clustered supernova explosions @xcite , for the first time demonstrated the presence of a dynamo process by direct numerical simulations .",
    "it turned out that the turbulence coefficients derived from the soca models are in good agreement with the new results from the direct simulations . in a similar way ,",
    "the box simulations of @xcite have shown an exponential growth of the magnetic field .",
    "their simulations , however , do not resolve the supernova remnant in itself .",
    "instead , the explosion site only serves as a source for the released cosmic ray energy . due to the fast diffusion of cosmic rays ,",
    "the pressure redistribution is fast enough to allow for similarly short growth times of several @xmath6 .",
    "the role of a magnetic instability of the parker type could be essential for this process , too .",
    "in general , the effect of magnetic instabilities in releasing kinetic energy should be considered as a possible mechanism for magnetic field amplification in galaxies  especially in regions with low star formation activity .",
    "the primary candidate of this type is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , which has a growth time on the order of the galactic rotation frequency and thus can become efficient on very short timescales . with todays computational resources ,",
    "global models of the mri are already within reach @xcite . however , these models still have to assume quite strong initial fields to properly resolve the fastest growing modes of the instability .",
    "when it comes to the explanation of the observed magnetic fields in spiral galaxies , there is one main reason for favouring the dynamo hypothesis over the primordial field hypothesis , namely the existence of fields  of equipartition strength  with a large pitch angle .",
    "if the field amplification were mainly due to the shearing motion of the differential rotation , the field would have to be wound up several times to explain its observed strength .",
    "this , however , would lead to an amplification of the toroidal field only , resulting in a configuration with an intrinsically small pitch angle .    for the dynamo scenario , which furthermore implies exponential growth",
    ", we additionally have an amplification of the poloidal field .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath7 of the growing field in the kinematic regime of the @xmath0  dynamo can be estimated from the dimensionless dynamo numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( for a definition see below ) via @xmath10 this leads to values between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for reasonable values of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16 . for a given rotational velocity ,",
    "the angular frequency is defined by the turnover radius , i.e. , the point where the rotation curve becomes flat .",
    "small turnover radii lead to rather large @xmath9 and thus to low pitch angles . in the saturated regime ,",
    "the situation becomes worse  at least for the conventional @xmath0  dynamo .",
    "this is because @xmath1 will then be reduced by non - linear effects and the pitch angle fades .",
    "direct simulations of the ism turbulence show a possible way out of this dilemma , namely by another saturation process , which we will demonstrate in the following section . moreover",
    ", the action of the magneto - rotational instability may be a reasonable candidate for the explanation of large pitch angles as they are observed in maps of polarised synchrotron emission for instance in the ringed galaxy ngc  4736 @xcite .",
    "global simulations of interstellar turbulence remain out of reach , at least if one is interested in resolving the relevant scales .",
    "therefore , we apply a hybrid approach , where we consider the mean induction equation @xmath17 for the mean magnetic field @xmath18 and apply closure parameters obtained from direct simulations .",
    "the background rotation serves as the main part of the mean flow @xmath19 and is supplemented by a vertical wind @xmath20 which is a result of the density - stratified turbulence driven by sne ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 in gressel et al .",
    "2009 ) . the test - field method , furthermore , yields an @xmath1  tensor of the form @xmath21 where the dependence of these quantities on the height @xmath22 is modelled according to the profiles in @xcite .    for a realistic global galaxy model one",
    "further needs the radial dependence of the relevant effects .",
    "the radial profiles of the rotational frequency , sn  rate , gravitational potential and density are in principle known . by means of a parameter study , we try to obtain the @xmath1  effect from our box simulations , accordingly . from these",
    ", we find a dependence of the diagonal terms of the @xmath1  tensor on rotation , namely @xmath23 .",
    "this is weaker than expected from soca theory , which predicts a scaling linear with @xmath24 and only a minor rotational quenching .",
    "consistent with soca , we find the turbulent diamagnetism @xmath25 to be nearly independent of @xmath24 .",
    "for the turbulent diffusivity @xmath26 , we apply only horizontal components which also vary according to @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence on the supernova rate is given in gressel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "after proper normalisation with a length of @xmath28 and a diffusion time @xmath29 with @xmath30 , the dynamo is characterised by the reynolds numbers @xmath31     and vertical profiles of the fountain flow and turbulent transport coefficients . ]",
    "we assume a disk of radius @xmath32 and with a height of @xmath33 , according to our box dimension in the direct simulations .",
    "we approximate the profiles of the turbulence coefficients by smooth functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the vertical dependence of the @xmath1  tensor can simply be reproduced by a sine function @xmath34 with a scale height @xmath35 .",
    "the mean vertical velocity is linearly growing with height .",
    "only the diagonal terms of the @xmath1  tensor have a radial dependence proportional to @xmath24 , whereas the other terms are constant .",
    "we , furthermore , use a simple @xmath1  quenching @xmath36 for the full tensor , i.e. , including the diamagnetic term @xmath25 .    in our first run ,",
    "we neglect turbulent diamagnetism and mean vertical velocity , as it is done in the classical @xmath0  dynamo . in this model , we find a growth time of @xmath37 , a field strength for the toroidal component @xmath38 and the radial component @xmath39 .",
    "if we neglect only the fountain flow , the field decays . for the _ real _ model",
    ", we find a growth rate of @xmath40  similar to the box simulation .",
    "the field now saturates earlier with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the final state is not determined by the usual @xmath1  quenching in this case .",
    "instead , a combination of fountain flow and quenching of the diamagnetic term leads to the saturation of the dynamo .",
    "this means , the dynamo stops growing because of field losses by the fountain flow . as a nice consequence of this non - linear feedback ,",
    "the pitch angle remains large in the saturated regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pitch ] ) .",
    "moreover , in fig .  [",
    "fig : polmap ] we present directions of the magnetic field resulting from polarised emission of synchrotron radiation , where we assumed a scale height of @xmath43 for the relativistic electron distribution .    in table",
    "[ tab : pitch ] , the pitch angle is given for a choice of different models . comparing @xmath44 with the initial pitch angle @xmath45 during the kinematic growth phase",
    ", we find reasonable agreement .",
    "the final value @xmath46 in the saturated state for the first three models is similar to the value during the kinematic growth phase .    in order to have a higher pitch angle for our rotation law with @xmath47 , we need larger values of @xmath8 and , consequently , a larger vertical outflow .",
    "otherwise the @xmath1  quenching would reduce the final pitch angle  as is the case in model e. this increase of the mean outflow velocity with increasing sn  rate is indeed observed in the box simulations ( cf .",

    "galaxies are known to be unstable with respect to the magneto - rotational instability .",
    "this instability , discovered by @xcite and @xcite , has meanwhile been studied in great detail in the astrophysical context ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite pointed to the possibility of turbulence generation by the mri in regions of low star formation activity .",
    "@xcite recently simulated the mri in a vertically stratified two - phase ism box model .",
    "@xcite investigated the stability of global galactic disks . for a disk threaded by a weak vertical field",
    ", they estimated a field strength of @xmath48 for the onset of the instability .",
    "accordingly , the mri should already be present during the galaxy formation process  and therefore a good candidate for the seed field of a turbulent dynamo .",
    "the most unstable mode in their idealised galactic disk model is of quadrupolar type .",
    "a very interesting result is the large pitch angle of @xmath49 for the fastest growing mode . for weak fields ,",
    "the unstable modes have a small spatial scale but with the property of a uniform large pitch angle .",
    "this leads to a smooth map of magnetic vectors for the polarised radio emission , but the faraday rotation measure will be small for these types of magnetic fields .",
    "the instability , moreover , has a very short growth time proportional to the rotation time .",
    "a proof for a large scale dynamo driven by the mri in the sense , that a small initial field can be amplified over several magnitudes has not been given yet .",
    "this is because it is numerical difficult to resolve the small spatial scales for the unstable modes connected to the weak initial field . nevertheless , there are hints that the process is possible .",
    "especially the turbulence excited by mri in a stratified disk gives a non - vanishing @xmath1  effect , but with negative sign in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in configurations with large pitch angles , we here consider global models of a density - stratified galactic disk with a uniform vertical field .",
    "tests with toroidal fields did not produce a comparable radial field component .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed an isothermal disk where the rotation and vertical density stratification is supported by the gravitational potential . without magnetic fields",
    "the configuration was tested to be in a stationary equilibrium over @xmath50 with only small velocity fluctuations below @xmath51 , which are slowly decaying with time .",
    "the applied density profile is @xmath52 with the scale height @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that the density minimum is about 0.02 @xmath55 .",
    "the rotation curve is , furthermore , defined by ( [ eq : brandt ] ) with the turnover radius @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the inner radius of our disk model is @xmath58 and the outer radius @xmath59 .",
    "the vertical extent is @xmath60 . within @xmath61",
    ", we use a constant grid spacing with 256 grid points and a non - uniform grid for the outer regions with 128 points at each side .",
    "this means , the inner disk has a resolution of about @xmath62 and for the outer disk we yield about @xmath63 .",
    "this is consistent with a density variation of a factor 100 , in order to get a comparable growth of the unstable modes for a uniform magnetic field strength within our restricted resolution .",
    "the radial boundary is reflecting and the vertical boundary is reflecting for the velocity only , while the tangential component of the magnetic field and the gradient of the vertical component are set to zero . under these conditions ,",
    "the vertical flux is conserved but a development of horizontal flux is allowed .    applying a weak and uniform vertical magnetic field of @xmath64 , we find an exponential growth of the unstable mode after a transient relaxation phase of about @xmath65 .",
    "the field starts to grow at the inner radial boundary , where @xmath24 has a maximum . as the field grows further , it spreads out radially .",
    "at the same time , the maxwell stress causes an inflow in the inner part of the magnetised region . at the outer magnetic region",
    ", we observe an outflow of mass , which is a consequence of angular momentum conservation .",
    "because of our closed boundaries , the density increases strongly at the inner boundary and moderately at the outer boundary .",
    "we see a weak change of the rotation curve at the boundaries , compensating the developing pressure gradients .",
    "this is probably an artefact of the closed boundaries .",
    "tests with larger radial domains have shown that the change of the rotation curve is restricted to the boundary region .",
    "finally , the field growth saturates . at the moment",
    "it is unclear whether the saturation is caused by the non - linear feedback of the developed turbulence .",
    "the reduction of the pitch angle could in fact be a hint that the system reaches the diffusive limit of the instability , where we know from linear analysis that the unstable mode , in this regime , is mainly toroidal . on the other hand",
    ", we see a large - scale meridional circulation in the disk . moreover , our model disk has a limited mass reservoir , which could be another reason for the early saturation with rather low magnetic field strength .",
    "as long as the toroidal and radial field strength are below the field strength of the initial vertical field , the field parallel to the disk grows with a time of @xmath66 ; later we observe growth times of @xmath67 until the saturation sets in .",
    "it should be noted that the growth - time of a possible mri - driven dynamo has not to be as fast as the growth time of the instability .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrirad ] , we plot radial profiles which have been averaged along the vertical and azimuthal direction for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the values shown are the components of the velocity , magnetic field and their corresponding rms values .",
    "a large - scale meridional circulation develops with an amplitude of roughly 0.5 of the rms value ( @xmath70 for the vertical component and @xmath71 for the radial component ) .",
    "the mean magnetic field along the z and @xmath72  direction are of the same order as the rms  values of the fields .",
    "only the mean radial field is by an order of magnitude smaller than the rms  field .",
    "we find @xmath73 and for the mean - field @xmath74 , corresponding to pitch angles of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the pitch angle in the polarisation map varies from @xmath77 to @xmath78 if the boundaries are excluded ( @xmath79 ) .    initially , at time @xmath80",
    ", the pitch angle varies from @xmath78 to @xmath81 for @xmath82 . in the outer region",
    "the field is still too weak , and we do not observe any polarised emission .",
    "[ fig : mridiskpol ] shows a slice through the magnetic field at @xmath83 , the vertically averaged field along the lower disk half ( @xmath68 ) and the magnetic direction of polarised emission ( neglecting faraday rotation ) .",
    "varying the scale height height of the relativistic electron distribution from @xmath84 to @xmath85 gave no significant differences .",
    "note the smooth polarisation map for an incoherent magnetic field ( i.e. , with many reversals along the vertical direction ) .",
    "the pitch angle is here much larger than the pitch angle for the averaged field .",
    "new direct simulations of supernova - driven turbulence in a cartesian box have shown the existence of the turbulent dynamo in a galactic environment .",
    "we find the resulting balance of the turbulent diamagnetism with the mean vertical outflow to be crucial for the operation of the dynamo . using the turbulence of the direct simulations for the determination of the transport coefficients , one can show that the fast dynamo growth time of a few hundred million years is due to the fast transport by the mean vertical fountain flow and the downward pumping of the turbulent diamagnetism .",
    "this is in contrast to the slow conventional @xmath0  dynamo with growth times of the order of @xmath86 , where only diffusion contributes to a vertical field transport .",
    "we have shown the possibility of an alternative saturation process other than the simple quenching of the diagonal @xmath1  term . in the case of quenching via the transport mechanisms ,",
    "the pitch angle of the final saturated field will not deplete .",
    "but still , there are cases of very strong differential rotation where it may be difficult to get observed pitch angles of up to @xmath81 with actual sn - driven dynamo models .",
    "more detailed investigations of the ism model must be performed .",
    "for instance , cosmic rays could further improve the situation .",
    "also the effects of strong magnetic fields have to be considered , as magnetic instabilities could contribute to further amplification processes .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability would be a good candidate  not only as a generator for the seed field , but also for the generation of magnetic fields with large pitch angles .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether an mri driven dynamo can generate enough vertical flux through the disk in order to get solutions with large enough pitch angles , which are known from the linear unstable modes .",
    "but at least under a given vertical flux , the mri leads to incoherent magnetic fields , which appear in the polarised synchrotron emission ( neglecting faraday rotation ) as smooth spiral fields .",
    "the mean - field generated in such models has a smaller pitch angle than the polarised emission vectors , so a significant contribution from a small scale field enhances the pitch angle in the polarisation map .",
    "future rm  synthesis observations would be very helpful for the understanding of magnetic fields in external galaxies ."
