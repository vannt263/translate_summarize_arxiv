    "in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , azimuthal distributions of the produced particles with respect to the reaction plane are of particular interest . their anisotropies , which we refer to as `` flow '' , result from the interactions between the produced particles .",
    "they thus probe the hot stages of the collision and may provide valuable information on the state of the interaction region : thermalized or not , equation of state , etc ... @xcite in the recent years , flow has been measured by many experiments at the brookhaven ags with au projectiles @xcite and at the cern sps with pb projectiles @xcite .",
    "since the orientation of the reaction plane is not known a priori , flow measurements are usually extracted from two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "this is based on the idea that azimuthal correlations between two particles are generated by the correlation of the azimuth of each particle with the reaction plane .",
    "the assumption that this is the only source of two particle azimuthal correlations dates back to the early days of the flow @xcite .",
    "it still underlies the analyses done at ultrarelativistic energies , both at ags and at sps ( see , however , @xcite ) . however , there are various sources of direct azimuthal correlations between particles , which do not involve the reaction plane . we have shown in a recent paper  @xcite that the quantum correlations due to the hbt effect yield azimuthal correlations .",
    "when they are taken into account , the results obtained for the charged pion flow by the na49 collaboration  @xcite change significantly . here , we investigate other sources of non  flow azimuthal correlations .",
    "a first source is the condition that the total transverse momentum of the outgoing particles is zero : this gives a back - to - back correlation between their momenta , which can be evaluated quantitatively .",
    "this effect is usually taken into account at lower energies @xcite but has been neglected so far at ags and sps .",
    "other correlations are due to resonance decays such as @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , coulomb and strong interactions between pairs of particles with low relative velocities ( which we refer to as `` final state interactions '' ) produce small angle azimuthal correlations@xcite .",
    "most of these correlations are typically of order @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles emitted in the collision . at sps energies , correlations due to flow are so small that additional correlations become of the same order , and can not be neglected .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence also determines the variation of non  flow correlations with the centrality of the collision",
    ". therefore they increase with impact parameter up to very peripheral collisions ; on the other hand , they do not vanish for central collisions where the flow is zero by symmetry .",
    "they are very important at large impact parameters and should be taken into account , in particular , when studying the centrality dependence of the flow , which has been recently proposed as a sensitive probe of the phase transition to the quark  gluon plasma @xcite .    in section [ s : sec2 ] , we briefly recall how the flow can be extracted from two  particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "we use the same method and notations as in @xcite .",
    "the various sources of non  flow correlations are reviewed and their effects are estimated in section [ s : sources ] .",
    "the experimental data obtained by the na49 and wa98 collaborations for pb  pb collisions at sps are discussed in section [ s : spsdata ] .",
    "we show in particular that the effect of momentum conservation alone is large enough to reverse the sign of the proton directed flow measured by na49  @xcite , which is used to define the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath4 decays produce correlations which are of the opposite sign , and of the same order of magnitude , although we do not attempt to calculate them accurately . for wa98 ,",
    "final state interactions play an important part , and may explain a large fraction of the observed pion directed flow .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ s : sec5 ] .",
    "in this section , we define the flow and non  flow contributions to two  particle azimuthal correlations , and we show how azimuthal distributions with respect to the reaction plane can be extracted from these correlations .",
    "we call `` flow '' the azimuthal correlations between the outgoing particles and the reaction plane . these are best conveniently characterized in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath5  @xcite which we now define .",
    "we choose a coordinate system in which the @xmath6 axis is the impact direction , and @xmath7 the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane . in this frame",
    ", @xmath5 can be expressed as a function of the one - particle momentum distribution @xmath9 for a particle of type @xmath10 ( in this paper , we consider pions and protons ) : @xmath11 where the brackets denote an average value over many events with approximately the same impact parameter , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the transverse momentum and rapidity of the particle . since the system is symmetric with respect to the reaction plane for spherical nuclei , @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "the goal of the flow analysis is to extract @xmath5 from the data .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 are usually called directed and elliptic flow , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since the reaction plane is not known experimentally , one can only measure relative azimuthal angles between the outgoing particles .",
    "in particular , one measures the fourier coefficients of the relative azimuthal distribution between two species of particles @xmath10 and @xmath17 @xmath18 the two - particle distribution can generally be expressed as the sum of an uncorrelated distribution and two - particle correlations : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the two - particle connected correlation function . using this decomposition ,",
    "one can write @xmath21 as the sum of two terms : @xmath22 where the first term is due to flow : @xmath23 while the remaining term comes from direct two - particle correlations : @xmath24    from the flow term ( [ flo1 ] ) , one can calculate the fourier coefficient @xmath5 , up to a sign ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the detector used to estimate the reaction plane , @xmath27 the average value of @xmath28 over @xmath29 in @xmath26 , and @xmath30 the average over both @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",
    "experimental analyses usually assume that the only azimuthal correlation between outgoing particles is due to their correlation with the reaction plane , i.e. they neglect @xmath32 .",
    "this means that the published flow data are given by eq.([flo3 ] ) with @xmath33 replaced by the total correlation @xmath21 ; in turn , the total correlation can be reconstructed from the published flow data using eq.([flo1 ] ) .",
    "we shall see in section [ s : sources ] that @xmath32 is typically of order @xmath2 where @xmath1 denotes the number of outgoing particles . in a central pb ",
    "pb collision at sps , @xmath34 , so that one expects @xmath35 .",
    "this is certainly a weak effect .",
    "however , the total azimuthal correlation is also weak : since the directed and elliptic flow at sps measured by na49 are of the order of @xmath36 @xcite , one obtains from eq.([flo1 ] ) ( since it is assumed that all the measured correlation is from flow ) @xmath37 , only a factor of 2 larger than non - flow correlations . therefore one can not neglect the latter . in order to take them into account , one must estimate the various contributions to @xmath32 , subtract them from @xmath21 in ( [ decomposition ] ) to isolate @xmath33 , and calculate the resulting @xmath5 using ( [ flo3 ] ) . in @xcite , we applied this procedure to the na49 data on pion flow @xcite , taking into account correlations due to the hbt effect . in section [ s : spsdata ] , we consider in addition the effects of momentum conservation and resonance decays .",
    "several physical effects yield two  particle correlations , which contribute to the non - flow correlation defined in ( [ cnnonflow ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we discuss momentum conservation , resonance decays , quantum hbt correlations , and final state interactions , and we estimate their respective contributions to @xmath32 .",
    "global momentum conservation gives a back - to - back correlation between the produced particles .",
    "since we are interested in azimuthal correlations , we consider only transverse momentum .",
    "its contribution to @xmath20 , which we denote by @xmath38 , is calculated in appendix [ s : apa ] in the case where there is no other correlation between particles .",
    "the result is @xmath39 where the sum in the denominator runs over all the particles emitted in the collision .",
    "this correlation is clearly of order @xmath2 .",
    "the fourier coefficient @xmath40 is obtained by inserting ( [ cmomentum ] ) in eq.([cnnonflow ] ) . neglecting azimuthal anisotropies of the one - particle distribution , which are of the order of a few percent  @xcite , one finds a result which is non - vanishing only for @xmath41 : @xmath42 since @xmath40 vanishes for @xmath43 , the effects of momentum conservation must be taken into account only in the measurement of directed flow .",
    "eq.([c1pt ] ) allows to calculate the correlation arising from momentum conservation , as soon as the value of the denominator @xmath44 is known .",
    "this quantity is evaluated in appendix [ s : apb ] in the case of pb  pb collisions at sps .",
    "the value ( [ pt2_val ] ) is probably overestimated , which means that we underestimate the correction due to momentum conservation in the numerical calculations of section [ s : spsdata ] .",
    "eq.([c1pt ] ) shows that the azimuthal correlations between two particles due to momentum conservation are independent of the rapidities @xmath45 and @xmath46 and of the particle species @xmath10 and @xmath17 , but increase linearly with transverse momentum .",
    "the effect is therefore stronger for heavier particles , which have larger transverse momenta , as for instance protons .",
    "the centrality dependence is also easily determined : since transverse momentum spectra depend weakly on the centrality @xcite , @xmath44 scales like the multiplicity @xmath1 , so that @xmath47 scales like @xmath2 .",
    "note , finally , that momentum conservation does not contribute if the window used for the reaction plane determination is symmetric around mid - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the azimuthal correlation between the decay products of a resonance .",
    "it is known that many pions originate from @xmath3 decays , and that many nucleons which are excited into @xmath4 resonances@xcite , which then decay into a nucleon and a pion .",
    "when pions are used to determine the reaction plane , @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) decays must be taken into account in the analysis of the pion ( resp .",
    "proton ) flow ; when protons are used , @xmath4 decays must be taken into account in the analysis of the pion flow .",
    "resonances with higher masses are less abundant and will not be considered in this paper ; however , they may also give rise to sizeable correlations .",
    "the contribution of a resonance decay , say , @xmath0 , to @xmath32 is the product of two factors : the first factor is the average value of @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the azimuthal angles of a proton and a pion originating from the same @xmath4 ; the second factor is the probability that a given proton and a given pion originate from the same @xmath4 .",
    "this probability is hard to estimate .",
    "there are recent measurements of @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53  @xcite multiplicities , but this is not sufficient : indeed , due to the short resonance lifetimes , the decay products may interact again after they have been produced , in a way which depends on the detailed collision dynamics .",
    "microscopic models of heavy ion collisions ( see @xcite for a review ) could be used to calculate correlations from resonance decays , but the discussion in this paper will remain at a more qualitative level .    generally , in a two - particle decay , the azimuthal correlation depends on the relative magnitude of the velocity @xmath54 of the decaying particle and the velocities @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the products in the rest frame of the decaying particle : in particular , the azimuthal angles of the decay products are equal ( @xmath57 ) in the limit where @xmath58 , while they are back - to - back ( @xmath59 ) if @xmath60 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : deltapt ] , which displays the average value of @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the decays @xmath63 and @xmath3 , as functions of the transverse momentum of the decaying resonance .",
    "( full curve ) and @xmath64 ( dashed curve ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the azimuthal angles of the decay products of @xmath0 ( left ) or @xmath3 ( right ) , as a function of the transverse momentum of the decaying particle in mev / c .",

    "decays , assuming that @xmath67 varies linearly with the mass @xcite one may choose @xmath71  mev , which results in both @xmath69 and @xmath70 slightly negative .",
    "in order to obtain the contribution of @xmath4 decays to @xmath32 , one must multiply the correlation displayed in fig.([fig : deltapt ] ) by the probability @xmath72 that a given pion and a given proton originate from the same @xmath4 , as explained above .",
    "let @xmath73 denote the fraction of nucleons are excited into @xmath4 resonances .",
    "then , the probability @xmath72 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of pions . from isospin symmetry ,",
    "one expects this probability to be the same for neutral and charged pions .",
    "since most particles are pions , @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath73 is of order unity , we obtain finally @xmath77 .",
    "the centrality dependence of this correlation is also in @xmath2 if the relative abundance of @xmath4 is independent of centrality .",
    "similar arguments hold for the correlations due to @xmath48 decays .",
    "note that a way to eliminate correlations from @xmath4 decays experimentally would be to measure protons and pions in widely separated rapidity windows .",
    "indeed , the maximum rapidity difference between the decay products of a @xmath4 is @xmath78 . in the case of the @xmath3 decay ,",
    "the maximum rapidity difference between the outgoing pions is @xmath79 , so that the corresponding correlation is harder to eliminate .      finally , there are correlations between particles with low relative velocities : quantum hbt correlations between identical particles , coulomb interactions between charged particles , and strong interactions .",
    "azimuthal correlations between identical particles due to the hbt effect were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the fourier coefficient @xmath80 is of order unity if the relative momentum @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the size of the particle source .",
    "it depends weakly on @xmath84 .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath85 integrated over phase space is therefore @xmath86 , where @xmath87 denotes a typical momentum . in the case of a high temperature massless pion gas ,",
    "@xmath87 is of order @xmath88 , while the particle density @xmath89 is of order @xmath90 , so that @xmath85 is again of order @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one would expect the centrality dependence of @xmath85 to follow the same behavior .",
    "however , the measured hbt radii vary more slowly than @xmath91  @xcite . in collisions with sulphur projectiles , a dependence in @xmath92",
    "was found with @xmath93  @xcite . if the same behavior holds for pb ",
    "pb collisions , the dependence of azimuthal hbt correlations with centrality will be in @xmath94 .",
    "finally , @xmath95 is proportional to the one  particle momentum distribution , hence it is larger at low @xmath12 .    more generally , all particles with low relative velocities undergo final state interactions , strong and/or electrostatic @xcite .",
    "one defines the invariant momentum as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the reduced mass and @xmath98 is the relative velocity of the two particles with 4-momenta @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "then the correlations due to strong interactions are sizeable only in a limited @xmath101 range , independent of the size of the interaction region .",
    "for instance , proton  proton correlations , which are dominated by strong interactions , are maximum for @xmath102  mev / c , and negligible for @xmath103  mev / c , for any projectile and target@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the range over which coulomb correlations are significant depends on the system size . for pb ",
    "pb collisions at sps , @xmath104 correlations , which are dominated by the coulomb repulsion , extend up to @xmath105  mev / c  @xcite . both coulomb and strong interactions",
    "give rise to small angle azimuthal correlations , similar to those due to the hbt effect .",
    "thus , the resulting contribution to @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath106 , is expected to be weakly dependent on the order @xmath84 of the fourier component , and @xmath107 is roughly proportional to the one  particle distribution .    the centrality dependence differs for coulomb and strong interactions . for strong interactions , the strength of the correlation at a given @xmath101 varies like @xmath108 , where @xmath54 is the volume of the system  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the range of the interaction is much smaller than the size of the system .",
    "thus the centrality dependence follows a @xmath2 behavior . for coulomb interactions , which are long  ranged ,",
    "the @xmath1 dependence is weaker .",
    "we do not attempt to evaluate this dependence .",
    "by analogy with the coulomb potential , it might vary like @xmath109 , with @xmath110 the size of the interaction region , i.e. like @xmath111 .",
    "both hbt and final state interactions can be eliminated by studying the correlation between particles widely separated in phase space , so that their invariant relative momentum is much larger than , typically , 50  mev / c .",
    "the properties of the three main types of two  particle correlations studied above are summarized in table i. note that while the average over all phase space of the three is of order @xmath2 , they can be much larger in definite regions of phase space , for example at low relative momentum for hbt correlations .",
    "note also that this catalogue of two - particle correlations may not be exhaustive .",
    "as we have seen , two  particle correlations are generally of order @xmath2 , much smaller than unity .",
    "we therefore assume that the contributions of the various effects can simply be added .",
    "if one studies the correlation between identical pions , for instance , there are contributions to @xmath32 from momentum conservation , denoted by @xmath40 , from @xmath3 decays , denoted by @xmath112 , from hbt correlations , denoted by @xmath85 , and from final state interactions , denoted by @xmath106 .",

    "the most detailed flow analyses in pb  pb collisions at sps were performed by the na49 and wa98 collaborations .",
    "na49 estimates the reaction plane using pions in the forward hemisphere , while wa98 uses protons and fragments close to the target rapidity . in this section",
    ", we discuss to what extent non  flow correlations may contribute to the measured azimuthal correlations , which are assumed to be solely due to flow in both experiments . in the case of the na49 data",
    ", we shall explicitly subtract the various non - flow correlations , following the method outlined in section [ s : sec2 ] , and see what the `` true '' flow might be .",
    "our discussion of wa98 data will remain at a semi - quantitative level due to the complex acceptance of the plastic ball detector used for the flow analysis .      the na49 experiment at cern measures the directed and elliptic flow of pions and protons in pb  pb collisions at 158  gev per nucleon  @xcite . charged pions",
    "are used to estimate the reaction plane , in the kinematic window @xmath114 and @xmath115  mev / c for directed flow , @xmath116 and @xmath117  mev / c for elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of identified particles ( protons and charged pions ) is then measured with respect to this reaction plane .",
    "we now show the effect of taking into account the various sources of non  flow correlations discussed in the previous section .",
    "we begin with the directed flow of protons .",
    "it is obtained from from eq.([flo3 ] ) , where @xmath26 refers to charged pions in the above mentioned kinematic window .",
    "the numerator in this equation corresponds to the correlations between protons and the pions in @xmath26 , while the denominator corresponds to the correlations between the pions in @xmath26 .",
    "the arbitrary sign in eq.([flo3 ] ) is chosen negative by na49 , in order to obtain a positive @xmath15 for protons ( see fig.[fig : protons ] ) , as usually assumed at high energies in the forward rapidity region@xcite .",
    "the correction to the denominator in eq.([flo3 ] ) from non - flow correlations will be discussed below , when we discuss the pion flow .",
    "it is a small correction , of a few percent .",
    "the numerator of eq.([flo3 ] ) gets contributions from momentum conservation , @xmath0 decays , and final state interactions .",
    "we first discuss momentum conservation .",
    "the corresponding azimuthal correlation is given by eqs.([c1pt ] ) and ( [ pt2_val ] ) .",
    "since it is negative , once it is subtracted from the measured correlation ( [ decomposition ] ) , this gives a positive correction to the correlations due to flow @xmath118 . because of the negative sign in ( [ flo3 ] ) , the correction to @xmath15 is finally negative . as can be seen in fig.[fig : protons ] , the correction is so large that the sign of the proton directed flow is now negative for almost all @xmath12 .",
    "now , the sign of the proton directed flow is particularly important since it is used to fix the arbitrary sign in eq.([flo3 ] ) , which is chosen so that @xmath119 in the forward rapidity region for protons .",
    "the surprising result is that the directed flows of pions and protons now have the same sign .",
    "this is contrary to the theoretical expectation that nucleons and pions flow in opposite directions , because of pion rescattering @xcite , and to other measurements at ags @xcite and at sps @xcite .",
    "since the correlation between pions and protons from @xmath0 decays is positive ( see fig.[fig : deltat ] ) , it may restore the original sign of the proton directed flow @xmath15 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , an accurate computation of this correlation would require a microscopic model .",
    "we present in fig.[fig : protons ] a crude estimate of the effect , based on a simple monte - carlo calculation taking into account the acceptance windows of na49 for protons and pions .",
    "we do not take into the possible rescatterings of the decay products .",
    "our assumptions are the following : 50% of the outgoing protons originate from @xmath4 decays , as suggested by simulations based on the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "we take into account the fact that only @xmath120 of @xmath4 decays yield a charged pion .",
    "the mass distribution of @xmath4 s follows a lorentzian , their rapidity distribution is flat between 0 and 5.8 ( i.e. between the target and projectile rapidities ) , and their transverse momentum distribution is exponential in @xmath121 ( see eq.([mtspectrum ] ) ) with an inverse slope parameter @xmath122  mev , as for protons .",
    "one sees in fig.[fig : protons ] that correlations from @xmath4 decays can indeed restore the positive sign for the proton directed flow , since their contribution is almost as large as that from momentum conservation in absolute value .     of protons , integrated over the range @xmath123 , as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath12 , measured by na49 ( open squares ) , taking into account momentum conservation only ( with error bars ) , and with a simulation of correlations from @xmath4 decays ( filled squares ) .",
    "error bars are taken from experiment . ]    in principle , one should also take into account final state interactions .",
    "since the pions used to determine the reaction plane are approximately half @xmath124 and half @xmath125 , coulomb effects cancel .",
    "correlations between pions and protons due to strong interactions are small and should not contribute significantly to @xmath21 .",
    "we now turn to the directed flow of charged pions . since pions are also used to estimate the reaction plane , pion ",
    "pion correlations are involved in both the numerator and the denominator of eq.([flo3 ] ) .",
    "following eq.([hbtpt ] ) , we must take into account momentum conservation , @xmath48 decays , the hbt effect , and final state interactions .",
    "we neglect final state interactions for the same reasons as for protons . according to fig.[fig : deltat ] , the correlation from @xmath48 decay is small .",
    "we also neglect it .",
    "three sets of points are displayed in fig.[fig : fig1 ] : na49 data without correction , with correction for hbt correlations ( taken from @xcite ) and with correction for hbt and momentum conservation .",
    "while the correction due to the hbt effect is important at low @xmath12 , momentum conservation changes the pion flow at high @xmath12 ; the latter effect is less important than for protons , because pions have lower transverse momenta .",
    "however , the positive pion flow observed by na49 at high @xmath12 seems to be explained by momentum conservation .",
    "let us say a few words of elliptic flow . here ,",
    "momentum conservation does not contribute , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "for protons , @xmath4 decays probably give a negligible contribution to @xmath126 , as explained in section [ s : resonances ] .",
    "for pions , hbt correlations significantly reduce elliptic flow at low @xmath12 , as shown in @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath48 decays should be taken into account .",
    "as discussed in section [ s : resonances ] , they give a negative correlation , i.e. opposite to the correlation due to flow . therefore , taking @xmath48 decays into account would lead to a ( slight ) increase of the pion @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the centrality dependence of the directed and elliptic flow of pions has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "it is striking to note that both increase continuously as the reaction becomes more peripheral , which is the behavior expected for non  flow correlations .",
    "we have shown that at least a fraction of the measured correlation , which is interpreted as flow , is due to non  flow correlations .",
    "even if it is only a small fraction , it will increase with impact parameter and eventually dominate for the most peripheral collisions .",
    "it is thus likely that the measurements of flow at large impact parameter are contaminated by non",
    " flow phenomena .",
    "however , none of the above mechanisms can explain the observed @xmath13 dependence of directed flow , which increases ( in absolute value ) up to the projectile rapidity for peripheral collisions .     of pions , integrated between @xmath127 , as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath12 in mev / c , measured by na49 ( open squares ) , after subtraction of hbt correlations ( filled squares ) , and after subtraction of both hbt and transverse momentum conservation correlations ( with error bars ) .",
    "]      we shall now discuss the results obtained by the wa98 experiment at cern for the directed flow of protons and positive pions @xcite .",
    "there , the reaction plane is estimated using protons and fragments detected by the plastic ball , in the target rapidity region @xmath128 .",
    "one then measures the azimuthal angle of a positive pion or a proton detected in the plastic ball with respect to this estimated plane .",
    "if the particle is a proton , it is not used in the determination of the reaction plane to avoid autocorrelations .",
    "two points closer to midrapidity are obtained using the tracking system , for which the flow is zero within error bars ; we shall not consider these two points here .",
    "contrary to the na49 analysis where pions were used to estimate the reaction plane , the flow of protons ( resp .",
    "pions ) is now determined from proton  proton ( resp .",
    "proton ) azimuthal correlations .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is still obtained from eq.([flo3 ] ) , where the arbitary sign is again chosen negative , so that the directed flow of protons be negative , as it should in the backward rapidity region . on the other hand , the directed flow of pions is positive , i.e. pions flow opposite to the protons .",
    "wa98 measures the directed flow @xmath15 in the target fragmentation region . since @xmath15 vanishes at midrapidity , it is expected to be larger there than in the more central rapidity region , where na49 is working . indeed , the measured values of @xmath15 are larger for wa98 than for na49 . for semi - central collisions ,",
    "@xmath129 is about @xmath130 for both pions and protons .",
    "following eq.([flo1 ] ) , this corresponds to an azimuthal correlation @xmath131 , either between pions and protons or between protons , an order of magnitude larger than for na49 .",

    ", @xmath132 reaches a maximum of @xmath133 for an impact parameter @xmath134  fm , while for pions @xmath15 increases with @xmath135 up to very peripheral collisions , where it reaches values as high as @xmath136 .",
    "the latter centrality dependence is reminiscent of the @xmath2 behavior of non  flow correlations , which suggests that part of the measured flow is spurious .",
    "we thus review the various non  flow correlations listed in section [ s : sources ] to evaluate their contributions .",
    "we shall see that final state interactions are the only significant ones , and that they may explain the pion flow at large impact parameter .",
    "momentum conservation is less important than for the na49 experiment .",
    "the reason is that the particles detected in the plastic ball have low transverse momenta  @xcite . for protons ,",
    "@xmath12 is typically 400  mev , resulting in @xmath47 of the order of @xmath137 for the proton  proton correlation , following eq.([c1pt ] ) .",
    "this is much smaller than @xmath138 . for pions ,",
    "transverse momenta are even smaller . in both cases ,",
    "the contribution of transverse momentum conservation to @xmath139 is negligible .",
    "resonance decays will contribute to the pion flow .",
    "the sign of the correlation due to @xmath0 depends on the inverse slope parameter @xmath67 , as can be seen in fig.[fig : deltat ] .",
    "this quantity is smaller in the fragmentation region than in the central rapidity region , but probably still larger than 100  mev . then , the corresponding pion ",
    "proton correlation should be positive .",
    "it is thus opposite to the correlation measured by wa98 , and can not explain the observed pion flow .    finally , let us discuss the small angle correlations due to the hbt effect and final state interactions .",
    "we shall first summarize the results obtained by the na49 experiment for two - particle small angle correlations in the central rapidity region .",
    "then we extrapolate these results to the fragmentation region covered by the wa98 plastic ball in order to discuss the correlations measured by wa98 .",
    "the na49 collaboration has measured both proton - proton @xcite and proton-@xmath124 @xcite small angle correlations for central collisions .",
    "two - proton correlations , resulting from the interplay of the hbt effect and strong and coulomb interactions , were found to be positive , which means that they are dominated by the attractive strong interaction .",
    "they peak at a relative momentum between particles of 20  mev / c , where they reach @xmath140 , and are no longer significant as soon as @xmath141  mev / c .",
    "small angle correlations between positive pions and protons are negative , and typically of the order of @xmath142 for invariant momenta",
    "smaller than 40  mev / c , i.e. @xmath143  mev / c and @xmath144 .    extrapolating these results to the fragmentation region , we can estimate the azimuthal correlation @xmath145 for wa98 . in the case of proton ",
    "proton correlations , we need to evaluate the fraction of proton pairs having relative momenta less than 40  mev / c , i.e. with @xmath146  mev / c and @xmath147 , with @xmath148  mev . since the acceptance window is typically  @xcite @xmath149  mev / c and @xmath150 , this fraction @xmath151 with a correlation strength of 20% , this yields a value of @xmath145 of the order of @xmath152 , much smaller than the measured correlation @xmath153",
    "thus , the measurement of the proton flow is not influenced by small angle correlations .    in the case of pion ",
    "proton correlations , we first note that the velocity windows of pions and protons of the wa98 plastic ball overlap  @xcite , so that small angle correlations between pions and protons should be taken into account .",
    "in fact , the rapidity range is almost the same for pions and protons , while the transverse momentum range is roughly scaled by a factor @xmath154 , so that the acceptance windows roughly coincide in velocity space .",
    "then , for a given pion , the probability that a proton seen in the plastic ball has an invariant relative momentum @xmath155  mev / c is given by ( [ fraction ] ) with @xmath156 replaced by @xmath157 .",
    "this gives a factor @xmath158 , compared to eq.([fraction ] ) , so that the fraction is of the order of @xmath159 .",
    "using the correlation strength measured by na49 , this gives a correlation @xmath160 of order @xmath161 , comparable to the measured correlation .",
    "on the one hand , this value is overestimated since the acceptance windows for pions and protons do not exactly coincide in velocity space . on the other hand ,",
    "it is underestimated because the correlations are measured by na49 for central collisions , and they are even stronger for peripheral collisions .",
    "therefore it is likely that a large fraction of the @xmath124 directed flow seen by wa98 is due to the repulsive coulomb interaction between positive pions and protons .",
    "we have shown that the assumption that all azimuthal correlations between particles are due to flow is no longer valid at sps energies , where other sources of correlations become of the same order of magnitude due to the smallness of the flow .",
    "all the effects studied above , momentum conservation , resonance decays , hbt correlations , final state interactions , turn out to give important correlations . in particular , we have shown that the effect of momentum conservation is so large that it changes the sign of the proton directed flow measured by na49 : this sign is particularly important since it is used to define the orientation of the reaction plane .",
    "the methods currently used to analyse the flow can be modified in order to take into account these additional correlations and to subtract them from the measured correlations , as explained in section [ s : sec2 ] .",
    "correlations from momentum conservation can be calculated .",
    "they are governed by only one unknown quantity , the sum over all particles of squared transverse momenta @xmath162 .",
    "correlations from the decays of short - lived resonances can not be evaluated so easily . in this paper , we have only given semi - quantitative estimates .",
    "more accurate calculations would require a microscopic model of the collision .",
    "finally , correlations which affect particles with low relative velocities , i.e. those due to the hbt effect and to final state ( coulomb , strong ) interactions can either be measured independently , or eliminated by measuring correlations between particles in widely separated rapidity and/or transverse velocity windows .",
    "however , our list of correlations may not be exhaustive , and one can not exclude that other sources exist which are of the same order of magnitude as those studied here . there is no systematic way to separate the flow and the non  flow contribution to the measured azimuthal correlation ( [ decomposition ] ) .",
    "one could try to use the factorization property of eq.([flo1 ] ) to isolate the correlation due to flow . however , non - flow correlations may also factorize , as is the case for the correlation due to momentum conservation ( [ c1pt ] ) .",
    "a way to circumvent these difficulties would be to use the remarkable property of two  particle correlations , that they vary with the multiplicity @xmath1 like @xmath2 ( with the possible exception of coulomb interactions and , to a lesser extent , hbt correlations ) .",
    "this fact has been noted in section [ s : sources ] for the various correlations studied , but holds more generally for any extensive system , and would probably still be true for other types of correlations than those listed in section [ s : sources ] .",
    "this @xmath2 behavior determines the centrality dependence of non  flow two  particle correlations .",
    "since the flow is known to vanish for central collisions by symmetry , one could measure ( and then subtract ) non - flow correlations by measuring them for central collisions and then assuming that they vary like @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to select `` true '' central collisions ( with vanishing impact parameter ) experimentally , so that this procedure may not be accurate .",
    "future heavy ion experiments at rhic and lhc are likely to be affected in the same way by non",
    " flow correlations . at these energies ,",
    "directed flow is expected to be weaker than at sps , maybe undetectable . on the other hand",
    ", elliptic flow should be at least of the same magnitude as at sps .",
    "pions should be used to determine the reaction plane since they are by far the most abundant . as the multiplicity will be higher than at sps",
    ", non - flow correlations will be smaller , since they are proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "however , since the detectors will cover only a limited interval in rapidity , effects of @xmath48 decays , hbt correlations and final state interactions may be important and should be taken into account in the measurement of the pion elliptic flow .",
    "hard processes could give an additional contribution to non  flow correlations : there is a strong azimuthal correlation between jet fragments  @xcite . clearly , more work is needed , both theoretical and experimental , in order to obtain accurate measurements of flow observables at ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "alternative methods , based on multiparticle correlations , are currently under study  @xcite .",
    "we thank the nuclear theory group of brookhaven national laboratory for its hospitality during the period when this work was done .",
    "we thank terry awes , art poskanzer , hubertus schlagheck and sergei voloshin for detailed explanations concerning the na49 and wa98 flow analyses , and stefan bass for discussions .",
