    "until now , more than 200 extrasolar planets ( or exoplanets ) have been detected mainly by measuring the radial motion of their parent star along the line of sight .",
    "almost all exoplanets observed by this method are giant planets , like jupiter and saturn in our solar system , because massive planets are preferentially observed .",
    "although these planets are supposed to be formed in the disk surrounding the central star ( i.e. , circumstellar disk or protoplanetary disk ) , their formation process has not been fully understood yet . in the core accretion scenario @xcite , a solid core or protoplanet with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the earth mass , captures a massive gas envelope from the protoplanetary disk by self - gravity to become a gas giant planet .",
    "the evolution of the gaseous protoplanet has been studied with the approximation of spherical symmetry including radiative transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that rapid gas accretion is triggered when the solid core mass exceeds @xmath8 , and the protoplanet quickly increases their mass by gas accretion .",
    "however , the angular momentum of the accreting gas was ignored in these studies , because they assumed spherical symmetry . since the gas accretes onto the solid core with a certain amount of the angular momentum , a circumplanetary disk forms around the protoplanet , analogously to the formation of a protoplanetary disk around a protostar .",
    "the difference in the disk formation between the protostar and protoplanet is the region from which the central object acquires the angular momentum .",
    "the protostar acquires the angular momentum from a parent cloud , while the protoplanet acquires it from the shearing motion in the protoplanetary ( circumstellar ) disk .",
    "in addition , the gravitational sphere of the protostar spreads almost infinitely , while the gravitational sphere ( i.e. , the hill sphere ) of the protoplanet is limited in the region around the protoplanet because the gravity of the central star exceeds that of the protoplanet outside the hill sphere .",
    "the numerical simulations are useful to investigate the gas accretion onto a protoplanet and its circumplanetary disk ( hereafter we just call them as a protoplanet system ) .",
    "@xcite studied giant planet formation using one - dimensional quasi - spherical approximation with angular momentum transfer .",
    "they showed that as the protoplanet contracts , outer layers of the envelope containing sufficient specific angular momentum remain in bound orbit , and form a circumplanetary disk .",
    "however , owing to the spherical symmetry , the accretion flow from the protoplanetary disk to the protoplanet could not be investigated in their study . to study the accretion flow onto a protoplanet and the acquisition process of the angular momentum in detail ,",
    "a multidimensional simulation is necessary .",
    "@xcite investigated the gas flow around a protoplanet with relatively low resolution , and found that the spin rotation vector of the protoplanet becomes parallel to the orbital rotation vector .",
    "recently , the flow pattern was carefully investigated by many authors @xcite . however , since the main purpose of these studies was to clarify the planet migration process in a large scale ( i.e. , outside the hill radius ) , they did not investigate the region near the protoplanet ( i.e. , inside the hill radius ) with sufficient resolution .",
    "thus , in their simulations , we can not study the gas stream inside the hill radius .    to investigate the accretion flow onto the protoplanet system",
    ", we need to cover a large spatial scale from the region far from the hill sphere to that in the proximity to the protoplanet . for jupiter ,",
    "since the hill radius is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is jovian radius , we have to resolve at least @xmath111000 times different scales . to cover a large dynamical range in scales , a few authors used the nested - grid method .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between the spiral patterns within the hill radius and migration rate using three - dimensional nested - grid code .",
    "although they resolved the region inside the hill radius , they did not investigate the structure in the proximity to the protoplanet because they adopted a sink cell at @xmath12 that corresponds to @xmath13 at jovian orbit ( 5.2 au ) .",
    "thus , we can not observe a circumplanetary disk at @xmath14 in their calculation .",
    "@xcite also investigated the gas flow around a protoplanet using two - dimensional nested - grid code .",
    "they resolved the region from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "they found that a circumplanetary disk with @xmath17 is formed around the protoplanet . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of the protoplanet system using three - dimensional nested - grid code .",
    "they found that the gas flow pattern in three dimensions is qualitatively different from that in two dimensions : the gas is flowing into the protoplanet system only in the vertical direction in three - dimensional simulations .    in the present study",
    ", we calculated the evolution of the protoplanet system using three - dimensional nested - grid code .",
    "we found that after the flow around the protoplanet reaches a steady state , the angular momentum accreting onto the protoplanet system is well converged regardless of both the cell width and the size of the sink cell region , while the mass accretion rate is not well converged .",
    "although we calculated the evolution of the protoplanet system with spatial resolution much higher than previous studies , we still need further higher spatial resolution to determine the mass accretion rate onto the protoplanet .",
    "thus , in this paper , we focus on the gas flow onto and around the protoplanet system and the accretion process of the angular momentum , and do not deal with the mass accretion rate ( we plan to investigate the mass accretion rate with higher spatial resolution using a higher - performance computer in a subsequent paper ) .",
    "note that the specific angular momentum accreting onto the protoplanet system with fixed protoplanet mass does not strongly depend on the mass accretion rate as described in the following sections .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the frameworks of our models are given in  2 and the numerical method is described in  3 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  4 .",
    " 5 is devoted for discussions .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "we consider a local region around a protoplanet using shearing sheet model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the temperature is constant and the self - gravity of the disk is negligible .",
    "the orbit of the protoplanet is assumed to be circular on the equatorial plane of the circumstellar disk .",
    "we set up local rotating cartesian coordinates with the origin at the protoplanet and the @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath20-axis are radial , azimuthal , and vertical direction of the disk , respectively .",
    "we solve the equations of hydrodynamics without self - gravity : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the gas density , velocity , gas pressure , effective potential , and keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet , respectively . in the above equations ,",
    "the curvature terms are neglected .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sound speed .",
    "the keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the gravitational constant , mass of the central star , and orbital radius of the protoplanet , respectively .",
    "the effective potential @xmath26 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath0 and @xmath35 are the mass of the protoplanet , and the distance from the center of the protoplanet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first term is composed of the gravitational potential of the central star and the centrifugal potential , and higher orders in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are neglected .",
    "the second term is the gravitational potential of the protoplanet . using the hill radius @xmath36 equation  ( [ eq : phi ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath37      our initial settings are similar to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gas flow has a constant shear in the @xmath18-direction as @xmath38 for hydrostatic equilibrium , the density is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the surface density of the unperturbed disk .",
    "the scale height @xmath42 is related to the sound speed @xmath29 as @xmath43 .    in the standard solar nebular model @xcite , the temperature @xmath44 , sound speed @xmath29 , and gas density @xmath45",
    "are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the protostellar and solar luminosities , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean molecular weight of the gas composed mainly of h@xmath51 and he , and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "when @xmath53 and @xmath54 are adopted , using equations  ( [ eq : omegap ] ) , ( [ eq : nebular - temp ] ) , and ( [ eq : nebular - cs ] ) , the scale height @xmath42 can be described as @xmath55      our basic equations can be normalized by unit time , @xmath56 and unit length , @xmath57 .",
    "the density is also scalable in equations  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) since we neglect the self - gravity of the disk in equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "we normalize the density by @xmath58 .",
    "hereafter the normalized quantities are expressed with tilde on top , e.g. , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , etc .",
    "the non - dimensional unperturbed velocity and density are given by @xmath62 @xmath63 thus , non - dimensional equations corresponding to equations  ( [ eq : basic-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : basic-2 ] ) , ( [ eq : basic-3 ] ) , and ( [ eq : phi - eff ] ) are @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a unit vector directed to the @xmath20-axis .",
    "thus , the gas flow is characterized by only one parameter , the non - dimensional hill radius @xmath69 . in this paper , we adopt @xmath70 ( see , table  1 ) . as functions of the orbital radius and the mass of the central star ,",
    "the parameter @xmath71 are related to the actual mass of protoplanet in the unit of jovian mass @xmath72 as @xmath73 for example , in the model with @xmath74 , @xmath75au and @xmath76 , the protoplanet mass is @xmath77 ( model m04 in table  [ table : table1 ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we call model m04 ` the fiducial model . ' for each model , the protoplanet mass for @xmath75au and @xmath76 is presented in table  [ table : table1 ] . in our parameter range , at jovian orbit ( @xmath75au ) , protoplanets have masses of @xmath78",
    ". we will show our results assuming @xmath79 au and @xmath80 in the following .",
    "we will discuss the dependence on the orbital radius @xmath33 in  [ sec : jupiter - saturn ] .    in subsequent sections ,",
    "we use non - dimensional quantities ( e.g. , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ) when we show the structure of the protoplanet system ( figs .  1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 12 , and 13 ) .",
    "on the other hand , to compare physical quantities derived from numerical results with those of the present jupiter , we use dimensional quantities at jovian orbit when we show the time evolution or radial distribution ( figs .  2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 10 , and 11 ) of the mass @xmath85 and ( specific ) angular momentum @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) of the protoplanet system , in which the conversion coefficient from physical quantities at jovian orbit ( 5.2au ) into those at any orbit ( @xmath33 ) is described in each axis .",
    "in addition , for convenience , we redefine the time unit as @xmath88 that corresponds to the orbital period of the protoplanet .",
    "when @xmath75au is assumed , @xmath89 corresponds to @xmath90yr .",
    "to estimate the angular momentum acquired by a protoplanet system from the protoplanetary disk , we need to cover a large dynamic range of spatial scale . using the nested - grid method ( for details ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we cover the region near the protoplanet by the grids with high spatial resolution , and region remote from the protoplanet by the grids with coarse spatial resolution .",
    "each level of rectangular grid has the same number of cells ( @xmath91 ) , but cell width @xmath92 depends on the grid level @xmath93 .",

    "we assume the fixed boundary condition in the @xmath103- and @xmath104-direction and the periodic boundary condition in the @xmath105-direction .    in real units , using the standard solar nebular model , the scale height at jovian orbit ( @xmath1065.2au ) is @xmath107au .",
    "the computational domain in azimuthal direction corresponds to @xmath108au = @xmath109au , which is equivalent to the circumference of jovian orbit around the sun @xmath110 ( @xmath111au ) .",

    "c__e _ ( or _ h__j _ ) are similar . except for the calculation with @xmath116 , in all models , the structure around the protoplanet hardly changes for @xmath133 , which seems that the steady state is already achieved for @xmath133 .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of the protoplanet system as the same condition as ours but in two dimensions , and showed that the gas stream around the protoplanet is in a steady state after a short timescale of @xmath137 .      in  [ sec :",

    "in these models , the protoplanet mass is fixed , and only the maximum grid level ( or cell width of the finest grid ) is changed .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that the average specific angular momentum rapidly increases initially , then it saturates at a certain value in each model .",
    "although we adopted the same mass of the protoplanet , the saturation levels of the average specific angular momenta are different .",
    "the average specific angular momentum saturates at @xmath156 for model m04l5 , while it is saturated at @xmath157 for models m04l7 , m04 , m04l9 , and m04l10 .",
    "thus , there are a little differences for models with @xmath158 . for example",
    ", model m04l7 has @xmath159 , while model m04l9 has @xmath160 at @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , the average specific angular momenta are sufficiently converged in @xmath162 or @xmath163 within a relative error of about 15% . in the following ,",
    "we safely calculate the evolution of the protoplanet system with @xmath95 of the maximum grid level .      when we adopt the maximum grid level @xmath95 , the cell width is @xmath164 . in real units ,",
    "when the protoplanet is located at 5.2au , the cell width corresponds to @xmath165 cm whose size is 4.1 times the jovian radius .",
    "interior to the gas giant planet , there exists a solid core with @xmath6 in mass and @xmath166 cm in size @xcite .",
    "the size of the solid core is much smaller than the cell width adopted in our calculation . to investigate the evolution of a protoplanet through gas accretion , in principle , we need to resolve a solid core with sufficiently small cell size ( @xmath167 cm )",
    "however , since our purpose is to investigate the angular momentum flowing into the protoplanet system , we do not always need to resolve a central solid core and a protoplanet . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the gas around the central region makes an artificial pressure gradient force , which may affect the gas accretion onto the protoplanet system . to check this",
    ", we also calculated the evolution of the protoplanet system adopting the sink cell in some models .",
    "we parameterized the size of the sink : @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( models m04s01 and m04s03 ) .",
    "these models are also summarized in table  [ table : table1 ] .    in real units ,",
    "the radius of the sink in model m04s01 is @xmath170 ( @xmath171 jovian radius ) , while that in model m04s03 is @xmath172 ( @xmath173 jovian radius ) . during the calculation",
    ", we remove the gas from the region inside the sink radius in each time step , and integrate the removed mass and angular momentum that are assumed as the mass and angular momentum of the protoplanet system .",

    "the solid line shows that @xmath175 increases from the center to a peak around the hill radius , and drops sharply just outside the hill radius .",
    "the drop indicates that the angular momentum becomes negative at @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the rotational direction turns around between the region inside and outside the hill radius .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the protoplanet formed by the gas accretion in the protoplanetary disk has a prograde spin , and thus it has a positive ( specific ) angular momentum .",
    "on the other hand , gas far outside of hill sphere seems to rotate retrogradely against the protoplanet because it rotates with nearly keplerian velocity with respect to the central star [ @xmath177 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shear ] ) ] . as a result",
    ", gas inside the hill radius has a positive angular momentum , while that outside the hill radius has a negative angular momentum .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows that @xmath175 in models with the sink cell depends on the radius of the sink in the region @xmath178 .",
    "however , they do not depend sensitively on the size of the sink in the region of @xmath179 .",
    "for example , at @xmath180 , model without the sink ( model m04 ) has @xmath181 , while model m04s03 has @xmath182 .",

    "in addition , when the mass of the central star is fixed , the specific angular momentum is proportional to @xmath251 thus , the specific angular momentum increases with 2/3 power of the protoplanet mass .",
    "figure  [ fig:11 ] shows the average specific angular momentum derived from all models against the protoplanet mass .",

    "when @xmath0 is small , the gas flowing into the protoplanet system is affected relatively strongly by the thermal pressure .",
    "we can estimate the mass at which the gravity dominates the thermal pressure force from the balance between the thermal pressure gradient and gravitational forces . near the hill radius ,",
    "the thermal pressure gradient force is more dominant than the gravity when the kepler speed is slower than the sound speed ( i.e. , @xmath276 ) . on the other hand , when @xmath277 , the gas flow is controlled mainly by the gravity of the protoplanet even near the hill radius . using equation  ( [ eq : kepler ] ) ,",
    "@xmath278 is realized when @xmath279 which corresponds to @xmath280 of the protoplanet mass at @xmath79au .",

    "[ fig:11 ] , the evolution of the angular momentum for @xmath283 well corresponds to the analytical solution ( @xmath4 ) indicating that the thermal effect is negligible for @xmath284 .",
    "however , for @xmath285 , the average specific angular momentum is smaller than @xmath270 ( blue line ) . thus , when the protoplanet is @xmath275 , the thermal effect is not negligible for the acquisition process of the angular momentum because the gravitational potential is relatively shallow .",
    "thus , the thermal pressure seems to remain important for @xmath286 , although @xmath278 realized at @xmath287 .    to verify the relation of the thermal and gravitational effects , in figure  [ fig:12 ] , we plot the ratio of the azimuthal to kepler velocity ( @xmath288 ) around the protoplanet on the midplane for models",

    ", the flow speed inside the hill radius approaches to the kepler velocity , and the region dominated by the gravity of the protoplanet spreads outward . in this way , since the thermal effect decreases as the protoplanet mass increases , the growth rate of the average specific angular momentum approaches to the analytical solution ( eq .  [ eq : ana - j ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the evolution of the protoplanet system under the isothermal approximation , which might not be problematic in the circumplanetary disk , but may not be valid in the very proximity to the protoplanet . to investigate the thermal effect around the protoplanet",

    "as shown in  [ sec : sink ] , the cell width in the fiducial model having @xmath95 is about 4 jovian radius .",
    "thus , gas inside @xmath291 has the same thermal energy .",
    "if the protoplanet has almost the same size as the present gas giant planet , the thermal energy around the protoplanet may be overestimated in model without the sink cell , because an actual protoplanet is embedded in the small part of the innermost cell . on the other hand ,",
    "when we adopt the sink cell , the thermal energy around the protoplanet is underestimated , because the thermal energy is artificially removed from the sink cell . however , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : sink ] , when the sink radius is much smaller than the hill radius ( @xmath292 ) , there are little differences in the angular momentum acquired by the protoplanet system between models with and without the sink cell .",

    "[ sec : res - ang ] .",
    "the jovian radius is much smaller than the hill radius ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "in addition , the angular momentum flowing into the protoplanet system is determined by the shearing motion in the region of @xmath234 ( see [ sec : dis - evo ] ) . therefore , under the assumption that the protoplanet is smaller than the innermost cell width , it is expected that the thermal effect from the protoplanet is sufficiently small for the acquisition process of the angular momentum when we are using sufficient smaller cells than the hill radius .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested that gaseous protoplanet has a large envelope with high temperature .",

    "although the fraction of the angular momentum of the circumplanetary disk to the spin of protoplanet is not correctly estimated in our calculation , a part of the angular momentum is certainly distributed into the disk .",

    "to study the gas flow pattern and angular momentum accretion onto the protoplanet system , we have calculated the evolution of the protoplanet system in the circumstellar disk .",
    "firstly , we have investigated the dependence of the angular momentum accreting onto the protoplanet system on spatial resolution with different cell widths , and confirmed its convergence for the cell width much smaller than the hill radius .",
    "next , adopting the sink cell whose size is comparable to or slightly larger than the radius of the present gaseous planets in the solar system , we have checked that , in both models with and without the sink , the thermal effect around the protoplanet barely affects the gas flow pattern and angular momentum of the protoplanet system .",
    "thirdly , with sufficiently high spatial resolution , we have calculated the evolution of the protoplanet system with the protoplanet mass in the range of @xmath321 , where @xmath322 and @xmath2 are the protoplanet and jovian masses , respectively .",
    "the following results are obtained :    * the gas flow pattern in three dimensions is qualitatively different from that in two dimensions : the gas is flowing onto the protoplanet system mainly in the vertical direction in three - dimensional simulations . * the specific angular momentum increases as @xmath3 when the protoplanet mass is @xmath1 , while it increases as @xmath4 when @xmath323 . *",
    "the angular momentum of the protoplanet system is @xmath306 times larger than the present spin of the gaseous planets in the solar system . *",
    "a thin disk is formed only in the region of @xmath324 , where @xmath10 is the radius of the planets .",
    "this location agree with the orbital radii of regular satellites around the present gaseous planets in the solar system .",
    "these conclusions imply that the protoplanet system can acquire sufficient angular momentum from the circumstellar disk , and despin mechanisms of the protoplanet system are necessary to realize the present spin of the gaseous planets in the solar system .",
    "we are planning higher - resolution simulations to further investigate the evolution of the angular momentum of the gas giant planets in near future .",
