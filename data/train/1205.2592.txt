    "a pure spin current consists of flows of opposite spins in opposite directions with the same amplitude .",
    "it bears neither net charge current nor net spin polarization .",
    "spin currents are a key element in spintronics.@xcite    detection of spin currents is important for characterization and applications in future spintronics technologies.@xcite while a polarized spin current may be detected by the conventional faraday / kerr rotation spectroscopy@xcite or through ferromagnetic filters,@xcite a pure spin current , without a direct electromagnetic induction , is much less traceable .",
    "still , pure spin currents have been detected in a few pioneering experiments in which they were converted into signals detectable by conventional techniques .",
    "for example , the spin - polarized electrons or excitons accumulated at the sample edges where a spin current is terminated may be detected by the faraday / kerr rotation,@xcite polarized light emission,@xcite and polarization - selective absorption.@xcite or the inverse spin hall effect@xcite can be used to covert a spin current into charge / voltage signals for electric measurement.@xcite all such measurements , however , disturb the spin currents to some extent and are indirect .",
    "we are motivated to find a non - destructive way to directly measure a pure spin current.@xcite    a basic symmetry principle states that whenever there is a current breaking the fundamental symmetries of a system , an interaction may arise between the current and another current of the same symmetry - breaking type so that the fundamental symmetries are retained.@xcite a classic example is the ampre effect and the rsted effect where a charge current is coupled to another charge current or a magnet .",
    "a straightforward analogue suggests that a pure spin current may be coupled to another spin current .",
    "such an idea stimulated the proposal of direct measurement of a pure spin current in a direct - gap semiconductor by a polarized light beam.@xcite a polarized light beam can be regarded as such a `` photon spin current''@xcite by mapping the photon polarization into a spin-1/2 in the jones vector representation@xcite @xmath0 where the right / left circular polarization @xmath1 corresponds to the spin up / down state @xmath2 quantized along the light propagation direction .",
    "the effective interaction between a pure spin current and a polarized light causes a phase delay which depends on the light polarization and wavevector .",
    "the observable result is a circular birefringence effect which is similar to the faraday rotation but involves no net magnetization nor time - reversal symmetry breaking . since faraday s disocvery in 1845,@xcite the circular birefringence effect of spin currents is the first example of faraday rotation without time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "we dub this effect as _ spin current faraday effect_.    at this point , we should mention a recent remarkable experiment realizing the direct in - situ detection of a spin current through the doppler effect of a spin - wave.@xcite in fact , the observed doppler effect and our predicted optical birefringence effect are fundamentally related to each other .",
    "the former is the frequency shift of the spin wave , while the latter is the phase shift of the light accumulated by a frequency shift over a coupling time .",
    "the frequency shift is measured in the near - field as in the experiment , while the phase shift should be measured in the far field by light polarization detection .",
    "fundamentally , both are due to the effective coupling between a pure spin current and another `` probe spin current '' , either a spin wave or a polarized light , mediated by virtual excitations in the systems .    the effective light - spin current interaction is induced in a semiconductor by virtual excitations of electron - hole pairs .",
    "the specific form of the phenomenological coupling depends on the microscopic mechanisms.@xcite since the light polarization essentially couples only to the orbital motion of electrons , the spin - orbit interaction is needed to establish the effective coupling . as there is inherent spin - orbit coupling in the valence bands due to the relativity effect , the rashba or dresselhaus effect due to",
    "the spatial inversion asymmetries@xcite is not a necessity , thus the system can bear the inversion symmetry .",
    "the optical birefringence effect of spin currents@xcite is usually very weak , because a tiny light wave vector @xmath3 is involved in the coupling to the velocity @xmath4 of the pure spin currents .",
    "however , if the velocity of spin currents couples to another optical field , @xmath5 the coupling will be much enhanced .",
    "this means we can use the second optical field to drive the spins , which may result in the nonlinear optics of the pure spin current . in fact , such an analogy stimulated the prediction of the second - order nonlinear optical effects of pure spin currents,@xcite which was soon verified by experiments.@xcite    in refs .   and",
    "we have sketched the main ideas based on symmetry arguments and given the key expressions in a special model neglecting the energy band anisotropy . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate in a more comprehensive way the linear and second - order nonlinear optical effects of pure spin currents , including a systematic symmetry analysis of all relevant physical quantities , and a detailed derivation for the effective hamiltonian as well as the second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility .",
    "the microscopic derivation confirms the qualitative results obtained by the symmetry analysis .",
    "in particular , both the symmetry analysis and the microscopic calculation lead to the conclusion that the linear birefringence effect ( similar to the voigt effect in magneto - optics ) always vanishes and only the circular birefringence effect exists , and the energy band anisotropy induces only a relatively small quantitative modification of the results .",
    "the absence of the voigt effect is fundamentally related to the lack of the @xmath6 state in the physical spin of photons [ not the pseudo - spin in eq .",
    "( [ jonesvector ] ) ] .",
    "the microscopic mechanism of both linear and second - order nonlinear effects can be understood in a unified physical picture .    in this paper , we assume that the host semiconductor system has the inversion symmetry . we note that in compound semiconductors such as gaas the inversion symmetry is broken , which , though a small effect , is critical to some schemes of spin current generation.@xcite in our present scheme , however , the small inversion asymmetry in compound semiconductors is not important . for conditions used in our microscopic calculation , the spin splitting resulting from the dresselhaus effect due to the bulk inversion asymmetry ( the dresselhaus splitting is @xmath7  mev in gaas with doping density @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , much less than the detuning of the light from the interband transitions  @xcite that mediate the effective interaction ,",
    "so we can neglect the bulk inversion asymmetry in the measurement process even though it could be of vital importance in generating the spin current .",
    "also , in this paper , we consider only bulk materials , so the structure inversion asymmetry plays no role , though it is the basis of the rashba effect . without considering the dresselhaus and rashba effects due to inversion asymmetries , we avoid the subtlety in the definition of a spin current.@xcite the effect of inversion asymmetries on the interaction between the polarized light beams and a spin current , of course , is worth further study , but we prefer leaving this question open in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "_ pure spin current_. there is no term in the light polarization @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) that has the same symmetry - breaking type as the spin current , so it is not possible to have linear ( nonlinear optics is of course possible ) interaction between the spin current and the light without involving the wave vector .",
    "considering the wave vector of the light , coupling between the spin current and the photon current @xmath41 is possible .",
    "the linear birefringence effect ( similar to the voigt effect in magnetooptics ) is absent .",
    "due to the lack of @xmath6 state in the physical spin of photons , @xmath32 and @xmath33 preserve @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "therefore there is no linear coupling of @xmath42 to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , if the system has spherical symmetry , the effective hamiltonian would have a simple tensor contraction form as @xmath45 with only two coupling constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be determined by the microscopic mechanisms .",
    "a possible spherically symmetric system is the vacuum , but in general a semiconductor as a crystal does not have this symmetry .",
    "the general effective interaction in a semiconductor should have the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a parameter tensor determined by the microscopic structure of the material .",
    "since only the light polarization term @xmath50 appears in the interaction , the optical birefringence effect is circular , similar to the faraday rotation .    in realistic case , the spin current often has some special form . as a general case",

    "<S> a spin current has novel linear and second - order nonlinear optical effects due to its symmetry properties . with the symmetry analysis and the eight - band microscopic calculation we have systematically investigated the interaction between a spin current and a polarized light beam ( or the `` photon spin current '' ) in direct - gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is rooted in the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in valence bands and does not rely on the rashba or dresselhaus effect . the light - spin current interaction results in an optical birefringence effect of the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry analysis indicates that in a semiconductor with inversion symmetry , the linear birefringence effect vanishes and only the circular birefringence effect exists . </S>",
    "<S> the circular birefringence effect is similar to the faraday rotation in magneto - optics but involves no net magnetization nor breaking the time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a spin current can induce the second - order nonlinear optical processes due to the inversion - symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> these findings form a basis of measuring a pure spin current where and when it flows with the standard optical spectroscopy , which may provide a toolbox to explore a wealth of physics connecting the spintronics and photonics . </S>"
