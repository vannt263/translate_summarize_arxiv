    "enormous populations of 10,000 or more globular clusters ( gcs ) surround the central giant galaxies in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "this was first noticed more than forty years ago in the case of m87 at the center of the virgo cluster ( baum 1955 ) .",
    "while a gc specific frequency s_n@xmath1(number of gcs per unit @xmath4 of galaxy luminosity ; harris & van den bergh 1981 ) near 4 is typical for giant elliptical galaxies , some galaxies such as m87 have @xmath5 .",
    "harris & petrie ( 1978 ) concluded that either ( 1 )  the number of gcs scales with total mass and m87 has a mass - to - light ratio @xmath6 that is 2 - 3 times higher than other giant ellipticals , or ( 2 ) local initial conditions at the center of the virgo cluster stimulated m87 to form more gcs per unit mass .    until recently , the sparse data available on the subject indicated that s_n@xmath1  for central cluster galaxies was uncorrelated with any other obvious galaxy or cluster properties ( harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995",
    "; west et  al .  1995 ) .",
    "the puzzling variations in s_n@xmath1  among these galaxies was interpreted as reflecting local initial conditions , and therefore unpredictable from our current vantage point .",
    "thus , the latter of harris & petrie s two explanations grew in popularity ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; mclaughlin , harris & hanes 1994 ) .",
    "a general trend of increasing s_n@xmath1  with environmental density was recognized , however , and various authors attempted to explain why galaxies in denser environments , and central cluster galaxies in particular , might have been more efficient in forming gcs ( e.g. , west 1993 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ) .    a recent study of a complete sample of central galaxies in 19 abell clusters within 10,000  km  s@xmath7  showed that , in contrast to the conclusions of previous works , s_n@xmath1  for these galaxies correlates well with overall cluster properties , including velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity , and the local density of bright galaxies ( blakeslee 1997 ) .",
    "this study used the method of blakeslee & tonry ( 1995 ) , which combines information from the counts of faint point sources in the galaxy halos with measurements of the residual surface brightness variance after the galaxy and detected point sources are removed .",
    "the method allows for better constraints on the total number of gcs while simultaneously constraining the form of the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) , which is of interest because of its frequent use as a standard candle distance indicator ( see reviews by harris 1991 and whitmore  1996 ) .",
    "blakeslee , tonry , & metzger ( 1997 , hereafter btm ) showed that the observed s_n@xmath1  correlations were consistent with a simple model in which the number of gcs scales with mass rather than luminosity .",
    "( this was the alternative possibility raised by harris & petrie . )",
    "the gc formation efficiency , or the rate of gc formation per unit mass @xmath8 , would therefore be universal .",
    "btm found roughly @xmath9gc per @xmath10 .",
    "the observed correlations of central galaxy s_n@xmath1  with cluster density are then due to this scaling of gc number with mass in conjunction with the relative insensitivity of the present - day galaxy luminosity to cluster richness ( e.g. , postman & lauer 1995 ) .",
    "this is the same phenomenon that makes these galaxies rough standard candles .",
    "thus , rather than having anomalously large gc populations , these galaxies appear to be underluminous for their prominent positions in the centers of very rich clusters .",
    "blakeslee ( 1997 ) speculated that tidal disruption from the collapse of the surrounding cluster may have removed the star - forming gas and halted further luminosity growth in the central galaxy sometime after the gcs had formed .",
    "harris , harris , & mclaughlin ( 1998 ) suggested that protogalactic winds driven by a rapid initial starburst were what removed the gas and halted the luminosity growth . building on this idea , mclaughlin ( 1999b ) has compiled further evidence for a universal gc formation efficiency .",
    "these ideas do not conflict with evolutionary models in which gcs and other material are later stripped from the rest of the cluster members and added to the central galaxy ( muzzio 1987 ; ct , marzke , & west 1998 ) .    the present work uses keck imaging data to extend the btm study to larger distances and higher density environments . because the btm observations were conducted on a 2.4 m telescope , the sample was limited to clusters within @xmath11 , and this limited the variety of clusters that could be studied .",
    "in fact , the richest in that sample was the coma cluster , the very first one for which data were obtained ( blakeslee & tonry 1995 ) .",
    "thus , although btm found strong correlations of the central galaxy s_n@xmath1  with cluster properties , the full range of these correlations had yet to be explored .",
    "the sample of galaxies presented here extends twice as far in distance as the earlier sample .",
    "the following section describes the selection and properties of the present sample of galaxies .",
    "observations and data reductions are discussed in section  3 , which includes the radial number density distributions of the faint objects that cluster around the central galaxies .",
    "section  4 presents the main results on the gc luminosity functions , specific frequencies , and inferred mass formation efficiencies .",
    "section  5 then discusses the relevance of these results for formation and evolution models of gc populations and for estimates of the distances to these clusters .",
    "the final section provides a summary .",
    "the goal of this program was to extend the btm survey of gc populations in 23 giant elliptical galaxies ( ge s ) in 19 clusters to denser and more diverse environments . because of practical considerations , the selected clusters are all in the northern spring sky and at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "table  [ tab : samp ] summarizes the cluster x - ray , dynamical , and morphological properties .",
    "all x - ray information is due to jones & forman ( 1999 ) .",
    "the velocity information comes from a variety of sources , including zabludoff & zaritsky ( 1995 ) for a754 , hill & oegerle ( 1993 ) as modified by fadda et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a2124 , and barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) for a2147 , a2151 , and a2152 .",
    "there are discordant values in the literature for the a1644 velocity dispersion .",
    "struble & rood ( 1991 ) quote @xmath13 km  s@xmath7  from 92 galaxies and zabludoff et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) find @xmath14 km  s@xmath7  from 76 galaxies , but fadda et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) find a gently falling velocity dispersion profile and quote an asymptotic value of @xmath15 km  s@xmath7  from 84 galaxies .",
    "the tabulated value of @xmath16 km  s@xmath7  is found from a 3@xmath17-clipped average of 63 galaxies from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) within 1@xmath18mpc  of the central galaxy .",
    "there are also discrepant dispersion values published for a2147 and a2152 , the two overlapping clusters that along with a2151 comprise the hercules supercluster .",
    "zabludoff et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) found @xmath19 for a2147 and @xmath20 for a2152 from 32 and 21 galaxy velocities , respectively ; barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) find the much smaller tabulated values using 93 and 56 velocities , respectively .",
    "these latter authors employed a method of minimizing a vector that consisted of the two projected spatial dimensions and the velocity offset to unambiguously assign galaxies to individual clusters ( or the `` dispersed supercluster '' component ) in this complex region .",
    "this approach may tend to yield lower dispersion values but appears to be more consistent in giving mean velocities closer to the measured values for the respective central brightest cluster members .",
    "for instance , previous investigations generally found very similar redshifts for the three hercules clusters , while barmby & huchra find that a2152 has a significantly higher mean velocity , close to that of its central galaxy ( postman & lauer 1995 ) .",

    ", a series of artificial star experiments were performed for each field to test the completeness limits of the point source detection and check for systematic biases in the recovered magnitudes as a function of magnitude .",

    "the results of these tests were used in choosing the cutoff magnitudes @xmath48 for each field at which the point source detection completeness was 8590% and any photometric bias in recovered magnitudes was negligible . as the completeness generally depends on radius , two or three different cutoff magnitudes were used for different radial regions in each field .",

    "the purpose of these fits was to estimate the backgrounds ( primarily due to distant unresolved galaxies ) ; the same approach was employed by btm and previous authors ( e.g. , harris 1986 ) .",

[ fig : a2152rad ] ) , they were excluded .",
    "although one might consider adding other radial components to the model ( for faint unresolved cluster dwarfs or a distinct population of intergalactic gcs ) , the quality of the fits ( @xmath56 ) does not warrant it .",
    "any such additional components must be at a low level or have a spatial distribution extended enough to be nearly flat over the range of interest .",
    "the radial number densities of gcs in galaxy halos are also frequently parameterized as power laws of the form @xmath57 where the power - law exponent is typically @xmath58 for ge s , but with a range from @xmath59 to nearly @xmath60 ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; kissler - patig 1997 ) .",
    "the background - subtracted surface densities of gcs for the present sample of galaxies were fitted to power - law distributions of the above form .",
    "to aid in intercomparing the results , as well as to provide a better comparison for studies of more nearby galaxies , these power - law fits were done only within a radius corresponding to a projected distance of 105  @xmath18kpc  from the bcg centers .",
    "the fitted exponents are fairly insensitive to small changes in the magnitude or radial limits .",

    "it is important to bear in mind that the gc distributions shown in the figures and characterized according to these simple radial forms actually encompass multiple cluster galaxies in each case . in particular for a754 , a2151 , and",

    "specific frequencies are calculated below for the secondary galaxies in these three clusters . the galaxy 47",
    "northwest of the bcg in a2152 is comparable in luminosity to the bcg and has an obvious concentration of gcs ; this is the main cause of the flattening of the surface density distribution at small radii in this cluster .      after all objects brighter than the chosen cutoff magnitude @xmath48 are masked out of the image , the analysis proceeds by a fourier - space measurement of the variance in surface brightness due to objects fainter than @xmath48 remaining in the image .",

    "the @xmath65 fluctuation amplitude corresponds to the spatial variance in intensity from sources that have been convolved with the image .",

    "[ sec : results ] discusses how these are combined with the count information to constrain the gclfs and total population sizes .",
    "first , however , the following section addresses one other correction that must be applied for the current data sample .",
    "the clusters in this sample are of sufficient masses and distances that their gravity distorts the surface density of background sources .",
    "for this reason , the background level close to the bcg ( assumed to be at the cluster center ) may differ from that determined several arcminutes farther out .",
    "this effect is usually ignored in studies of gc systems in clusters .",

    "although it is the most distant in the present sample , a2124 is less than a factor of two more distant than the nearest one , and it is not especially massive .",
    "thus , lensing corrections were made for all the clusters as described below .    a cluster lens both magnifies the background sources and dilutes their surface density by some factor @xmath71 , where @xmath52 is again the projected distance from the center of the mass distribution ( assumed round )",
    ", @xmath72 is the redshift of the lensing cluster , and @xmath73 is the redshift of the source .",
    "( broadhurst et  al .

    "@xmath79 would lie at redshifts @xmath80 .",

    "for a general lens , the magnification can be expressed as ( see miralda - escud 1991 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the convergence and shear , respectively .",
    "the convergence is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the surface mass density at a projected radius @xmath52 , and we have used the general definition for the critical surface density @xmath93 in terms of the angular diameter distances from observer to source @xmath94 , from observer to lens @xmath95 , and from lens to source @xmath96 . for an axisymmetric lens with the symmetry axis along the line of sight ( i.e. , an apparently round lens ) , the shear is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mean surface density within @xmath52 .",

    "this gives lensing factors between the extremes of the singular isothermal and hernquist models .",

    "the small size of the current sample precludes any definitive determination of the presence of this effect .",
    "if it is true that the counts are simply overestimated due to contamination and/or that the extrapolation from the counts is too high because of non - gaussianity , then the reported s_n@xmath1  values should be decreased by 5 - 10% ( the fluctuation measurements carry more weight because of their smaller uncertainties ) .    a bias in _",

    "the secondary galaxies in the present sample ( open stars ) are lower luminosity ellipticals occupying the same central fields as the bcgs in these clusters .",
    "thus , open circles represent high - luminosity non - central galaxies , while open stars represent low - luminosity central galaxies . if the number of gcs depends more on central location than on luminosity ( as would be the case if there is a significant population of intracluster gcs ) , then one should expect the former galaxies to have lower specific frequencies than the latter galaxies , which in turn should have s_n@xmath1  values similar to those of the main central cluster galaxies .",
    "this is precisely what these figures show .",
    "the larger area of the lris field of view and the greater distances of the present sample of galaxies allows s_n@xmath1  values to be measured over a larger range in radius .",

    "the general increase in s_n@xmath1  between 40 and 65 kpc indicates that the gc distributions are generally more extended than the halo light .",
    "there is nearly a factor of two variation in s_n@xmath1  among these galaxies , and although this sample as a whole fits in nicely at the high end of the s_n@xmath1-density correlations , there is no such correlation apparent within this sample itself .",
    "three of the bcgs have @xmath14610 ; the two most luminous ones have @xmath147 , and the a2151 bcg has @xmath148 .",

    "possible implications of this observation are discussed in  [ ssec : evolution ] .      motivated by the increase in gc number with cluster density and the relative constancy of bcg luminosity which makes s_n@xmath1  depend on density , btm defined the quantity @xmath3  as the number of gcs per unit mass : @xmath149 , where @xmath150 here is the total mass in units of @xmath151 within the same projected radius in which @xmath152 is measured .",
    "the procedure of using projected numbers and masses is analogous to calculating s_n@xmath1  from projected luminosity and number ; harris et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) take a different approach .",
    "the btm @xmath3  parameter is similar to the @xmath153 parameter defined by zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) as the number of gcs per unit mass for isolated galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : egc ] shows @xmath3  calculated for the combined btm plus present sample using two different cluster mass models .",
    "the top panel uses a singular isothermal model , for which @xmath154 , and the lower panel uses the flat ( projected ) core model of btm , for which @xmath155 .",
    "cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) used the dynamics of the m87 gcs and found that the mass profile in virgo was between these two cases .",
    "the masses are calculated between projected radii of @xmath156  kpc and 40  kpc , the range appropriate to the gc number .",
    "thus , the `` singular '' isothermal model could be made to flatten within 4  kpc without changing the results . because the present calculation now more properly excludes this central region , and because of the slightly longer distance scale used here , the btm data points shown in the lower panel of the present figure  [ fig : egc ] are 6% higher than they were in btm s own figure  15 , except for the coma point , which is @xmath157% higher because it also uses a different velocity dispersion .",
    "the isothermal model of the top panel gives @xmath158 but probably overestimates the true mass ; the flat core model of the lower panel gives @xmath159 but likely underestimates the mass because it makes no account for a mass peak near the central galaxy . in either case , the scatter is about 30% and there is little trend left with @xmath141 .",
    "the highest point in both panels is a2151 , which has the smallest velocity dispersion in the present sample ; a dispersion more in line with its richness would lower its @xmath3 . without a2151 , the scatter in @xmath3  for",
    "the flat core model would be closer to 20% , while the isothermal model would show a marginal decline in @xmath3   with @xmath141 .",
    "however , the isothermal model gives more consistent results with radius , since its projected mass density goes as @xmath160 and the gc surface densities in figures  [ fig : a754rad][fig : a2152rad ] go as @xmath161 .",
    "table  [ tab : egc ] lists the values of @xmath3calculated within 40 and 65 kpc for each of the two mass models .",
    "the calculated @xmath3  drops by about 40% for the flat core model but only by about 10% for the isothermal model .",
    "some drop would be expected if the total gc system is a combination of cluster and galaxy gc populations .",
    "the new results are in good accord with those of btm , who proposed that the apparent universality of @xmath3  ( at least when calculated within a fixed metric radius ) reflects a universal gc formation efficiency in the dense primordial environments that have become today s galaxy clusters .",
    "thus , there remains no cause for invoking a density - dependent gc formation efficiency .",
    "the following section considers what light the present data shed on the formation , evolution , and luminosity functions of gc systems in clusters .",
    "as their numbers scale with overall properties of the galaxy clusters , the gcs of the central cluster galaxy might more correctly be called `` cluster globulars '' ( or cluster gcs ) as opposed to galactic ones ( cf .",
    "west et  al.1995 ; btm ) . of course",
    ", it may be more appropriate to break the total population down into cluster and galactic components ( e.g. , ct et  al .",
    "this does not suppose that the putative cluster gc population formed outside of galaxies , as it is difficult to imagine that the very dense regions where the gcs must have originated did not eventually become galaxies .",
    "however , these galaxies would be `` cluster galaxies '' ; thus , all of their associated gcs would have the potential to become `` cluster globulars , '' whether through early escape during the relaxation of the proto - galaxy , by later stripping during interactions , or by falling into the center of the potential well during cluster collapse to help form the dominant galaxy there .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999b ) contends that his view of the universal gc formation efficiency is `` quite different '' from that of btm , and thus different from the one given here .",
    "his main point of contention is that btm estimated efficiencies in terms of the number of gcs per unit total mass , instead of using only the combined mass of the stars and gas , i.e. , the `` baryonic mass . ''",
    "btm used the most convenient observable at hand to estimate masses , namely the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "no mention of the role of nonbaryonic dark matter was made in that work , apart from the statement that this approach obviated the need for ill - constrained assumptions such as dark matter biasing or a density - dependent efficiency .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999b ) is incorrect in stating that the btm efficiencies were computed using the total masses of the `` _ entire _ galaxy clusters '' ( italics his ) .",
    "rather , the masses were estimated within the identical projected radii in which the numbers of gcs were measured ( since we can only observe clusters in projection ) . if the gcs , which are known to scale with cluster properties , roughly follow the mass distribution , then the results computed within projected radii will be similar to those found within three - dimensional radii .",
    "in addition , the universal efficiencies proffered by btm and mclaughlin will be equivalent , modulo a scale factor equal to the ratio of the masses used . in a different work ,",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999a ) concludes that the mass distribution of the hot gas follows the overall dark matter distribution , at least at large radii .",
    "he quotes a ratio of the gas mass to dark matter mass in virgo of @xmath162 .",
    "thus , to convert between the different efficiencies , we need now only to estimate the ratio of the stellar and gas masses over the range in projected radii for which the gc surface densities were measured , i.e. , from @xmath424  to 40  kpc .    for the gas , we adopt the hernquist ( 1990 ) mass model from mclaughlin ( 1999a , b ) to obtain a projected mass @xmath163 over this range in projected radius . to estimate the stellar mass , we use a hernquist model having the same effective radius @xmath164 kpc as the photometry used by mclaughlin ( de  vaucouleurs & nieto 1978 ) , which extends out to @xmath42100 kpc .",
    "we normalize the model such that the spatial mass density of the stars @xmath165 equals that of the gas @xmath166 at @xmath167 kpc ( mclaughlin 1999b ) .",
    "this yields @xmath168 for this projected radial range ; the appropriate projected mass ratio is then @xmath169 .",
    "the identical value is obtained if one instead uses the mclaughlin ( 1999a ) mass model for the stellar distribution ( a @xmath170 dehnen model ) .",
    "thus the appropriate ratio of total to baryonic projected mass is @xmath171    the average of the values for the gc mass rate @xmath3  from the two panels of figure  [ fig : egc ] is @xmath172 this is similar to the value quoted by btm , so we will work with it . to convert this to a dimensionless efficiency",
    ", we adopt a mean individual gc mass of @xmath173 , as in mclaughlin ( 1999b ) . the inferred gc formation efficiency per unit total mass is then @xmath174 .",
    "using eq.([eq : masses ] ) to convert this to an efficiency per unit baryonic mass , we obtain @xmath175 .",
    "the errorbar here should be considered a rough lower limit on the uncertainty , which may be nearer to @xmath4250% , given the fairly crude mass models employed . in any case , this result is close to mclaughlin s proposed universal value of @xmath176 .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999a ) remarks on the similarity of the total stellar and gas masses which makes the baryon fraction @xmath177 .",
    "he also notes that the dark matter distribution is not constrained for @xmath178 kpc . in the model of harris",
    "et  al .  ( 1998 ) , the strong galactic winds that removed the star - forming gas from the proto - cd would have left the dark matter distribution intact , as this material is supposed to interact only gravitationally .",
    "taking the view of waxman & miralda - escud ( 1995 ) , navarro et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and aragn - salamanca , baugh , & kauffmann ( 1998 ) that the dark matter is _ more _ centrally concentrated than the hot gas , and thus more closely follows the overall baryonic mass distribution , we find @xmath179 , fortuitously identical to the mclaughlin value .    given these considerations , mclaughlin s universal gc formation efficiency appears identical in every palpable way to that of btm , who presented the initial observational evidence for it and made a rough first estimate of its value .",
    "( the idea itself goes back at least twenty years to harris & petrie [ 1978 ] . )",
    "mclaughlin s work has substantially refined the idea and allowed for significant progress on the physical mechanisms underlying the observations .",
    "up to now , this discussion has ignored the vast wealth of recent data on the color distributions of gc populations ( e.g. , ostrov et  al .",
    "1993 ; whitmore et  al .",
    "1995 ; geisler et  al .",
    "the complex , often bimodal gc color distributions of ge galaxies must surely be important clues bespeaking a complex enrichment history .",
    "the situation is simpler for dwarf ellipticals , which appear to have only metal poor gcs ( see ct et  al .",
    "1998 ) . in hierarchical formation models ,",
    "giant galaxies are constructed ( at early times for dense environments ) through chaotic merging of numerous smaller subunits that must have resembled dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) . to be consistent with observations ,",
    "the ge progenitors must have formed their high metallicity gcs during this process ; several lines of argument suggest this is possible ( see ashman & zepf 1992 ) .",
    "the final gc metallicity distribution will be broader and more metal rich than that of the dwarf progenitors , but in a continuous hierarchical collapse , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect distinct metallicity peaks or a change in s_n@xmath1  to occur .",
    "ct et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) have demonstrated using realistic galaxy luminosity functions that later dissipationless mergers can result in ge s having bimodal gc distributions , again without any change in s_n@xmath1 .    in any case , the similarity in the gc color distributions of cd galaxies and more ordinary ellipticals ( forbes et  al .",
    "1997 ) reinforces the conclusion of btm that there is nothing special , or unusual , about the gcs around central cluster galaxies .",
    "for instance , the gc color distributions in m87 and m49 in virgo are both bimodal in appearance , despite the fact that m87 s s_n@xmath1  is about 3 times higher .",
    "kissler - patig et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) pointed out that the similarity between the gc color distributions of the fornax cd ngc 1399 and the other fornax ellipticals is expected , despite ngc 1399 having an s_n@xmath1  twice that of any of the others , if s_n@xmath1  increases by a simple transfer of gcs through tidal stripping .",
    "however , stripping scenarios in virialized clusters have unsolved problems with time scale ( muzzio 1987 ) , and it is not at all clear that s_n@xmath1  should increase , since both stars and gcs will be added ( e.g. harris 1991 ) , although it might ( e.g. , ct et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "since both the gc color distributions and numbers per unit mass are normal in high - s_n@xmath1  galaxies , the question is one of the missing light : why do these galaxies lack the halo light necessary to bring their specific frequencies and mass - to - light ratios down to normal levels ? motivated by the `` standard candle '' aspect of bcgs ( e.g. , postman & lauer 1995 ) ,",
    "btm suggested that the collapse of the galaxy cluster tidally heated and removed the gas from the central galaxy and halted star formation there .",
    "improvements in numerical modeling of bcg formation can help to refine this idea .",
    "recent simulations indicate that giant central galaxies form on relatively short time scales during the initial collapse of the cluster .",
    "garijo , athanassoula , & garca - gmez ( 1997 ) simulated the formation of central galaxies in clusters with a variety of different initial conditions .",
    "they observed rapid growth of a central dominant galaxy and the early formation of an extended halo of debris .",
    "the cd obtained a great mass within 1  gyr for their higher velocity dispersion clusters .",
    "dubinski ( 1998 ) studied the collapse and evolution of a 550  km  s@xmath7dispersion cluster in a hierarchical formation simulation starting at @xmath180 and found that the most massive galaxies all merged together to form one central object in less than 3  gyr ( by @xmath181 ) .",
    "some other galaxies were subsequently accreted , but there were no more large mergers in the cluster center after @xmath182 .",
    "unfortunately , the simulations do not yet include modeling of the gas dynamics and star formation in the collapse .",
    "starbursts would likely occur during the rapid series of mergers , but arguing that gcs must have formed at a higher than normal rate in some clusters ( relative to the total number of stars formed ) does not solve the problem , which results from `` missing light , '' or `` luminosity saturation , '' not `` excess globulars . '' if the simulations are correct that massive central galaxies form quickly , and more quickly in the more massive protoclusters , then the simple assumptions that , ( 1 )  most gcs are older than most stars , and ( 2 )  the central galaxy quickly loses the cool gas necessary to form stars , are sufficient to explain the observations .",
    "the first of these assumptions is true in our own galaxy , and spectroscopy of a large sample of m87 gcs indicates that they are uniformly old as well ( cohen et  al .",
    "the second assumption is true today except in rare cases ( @xmath424% , according to lauer & postman 1994 ) .",
    "aragn - salamanca et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude from bcg colors out to @xmath183 that no significant star formation has taken place in bcgs since that epoch ; they suggest that the gas is less centrally concentrated than the dark matter , and hence unable to cool efficiently enough to form  stars .    both tidal heating ( btm ) and strong , starburst - driven galactic winds ( harris et  al .",
    "1998 ) during the cluster - collapse / bcg - formation epoch have been offered as means for removing gas from the bcg .",
    "the faster formation of bcgs in denser ( simulated ) environments would drive the gas out sooner . as an example , assume that the gcs formed first on a fixed short time scale , so that their total number is proportional to the mass in an isothermal model : @xmath184 .",
    "also assume that the amount of material for forming non - gc stars has this dependence , but that the time @xmath185 available for forming the stars is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion : @xmath186 .",
    "thus , @xmath187 and we reproduce a linear dependence as in the empirical relation given by eq.([eq : snsig ] ) .",
    "a more elaborate scenario awaits further advances in the simulations , but an analogy can be drawn with the situation in the milky way .",
    "if we assume that 90% of galactic stars formed after the gcs did and use the _ current _ mass - to - light ratio @xmath188 of the galactic stellar population to compute @xmath189 , a `` corrected '' specific frequency at that early time , then @xmath190 where @xmath191 ( harris 1991 ) is the galactic s_n@xmath1  today . this is simply meant to illustrate that after the formation of the galactic gcs and before the gas settled down to form stars in the disk , the relative amount of stellar mass in gcs was greater",
    ". in this sense , s_n@xmath1  ( i.e. , @xmath192 ) was higher at early times and",
    "has decreased because of star formation .",
    "of course , even if very few stars form in the cluster center after collapse , star formation will continue in other cluster galaxies as in the milky way ; given enough time , the central galaxy will accrete enough stars ( and some gcs too ) to decrease its s_n@xmath1  ( without affecting @xmath3 ) .",
    "mclaughlin et  al .  ( 1994 ) called this proces s_n@xmath1  `` dilution '' and suggested that they saw evidence for it in a possible correlation between s_n@xmath1  and bm type .",
    "improved measurements and larger samples ( ostrov et  al .",
    "1998 ; btm ) fail to support this trend , but this may be because bm type is not a robust measure of evolutionary state .",
    "in addition , kinematical studies of the galaxies within cluster centers indicate that the current merger rate extrapolated over a cluster lifetime will increase the bcg luminosity by only @xmath193 ( merrifield & kent 1991 ; blakeslee & tonry 1992 ) , consistent with the estimates of merritt ( 1985 ) , although aragn - salamanca et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a higher rate from the @xmath194-band hubble diagram for bcgs out to @xmath183 , approaching the cluster formation epoch .    the time scale for such s_n@xmath1  dilution will be shortest in highly compact , low - dispersion clusters such as fornax .",
    "( indeed , given the recent precipitous drop in published values of s_n@xmath1  for ngc  1399 , one might conclude it was on the order of years . )",
    "btm puzzled over fornax because its supposed high - s_n@xmath1  cd did not fit in with the observed correlations .",
    "however , two revised estimates both give @xmath195 ( ostrov et  al .",
    "1998 ; kissler - patig et  al .",
    "1999 ) , where we have corrected to the mean cepheid distance @xmath196 ( ferrarese et  al .",
    "1999 ) found for two fornax spirals .",
    "thus ngc 1399 now agrees well with the relation given by eq.([eq : snsig ] ) , for instance .",
    "however , the predominance of the cd halo in this galaxy and the correlation of s_n@xmath1  with the extendedness of the light distribution ( btm ) makes it reasonable to hypothesize that ngc 1399 originally had a higher s_n@xmath1  which has decreased through cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "there is evidence from x - ray data ( jones et  al .",
    "1997 ) that nearby ngc 1404 is in the process of being accreted ; when this occurs , ngc 1399 s s_n@xmath1  will drop by 10% ( see kissler - patig et  al",
    ".  1999 ) .    finally ,",
    "returning to the present sample of galaxies , we ask if there is any evidence for s_n@xmath1  evolution here .",
    "the sample covers the spectrum of morphological type .",
    "usually differences in cluster richness obscure any effects that might be associated with morphological state , but here the six clusters are fairly similar in richness . as noted earlier , the a2151 bcg has the highest @xmath197 and also a spiral fraction near 50% , indicating a significant amount of ongoing star formation in this cluster .",
    "the a2152 bcg and its close neighbor , which together constitute a binary bcg , have high values of s_n@xmath1  given that the x - ray properties show a2152 to be the poorest in the sample .",
    "the richest cluster is a754 , which unexpectedly has the lowest @xmath198 , but its morphology and the bcg s high luminosity suggest that the cluster is well evolved .",
    "similarly , the a1644 bcg s s_n@xmath1  would increase to @xmath199 if its luminosity were about the mean for this sample .",
    "thus , we may be beginning to see the effects of central galaxy luminosity evolution causing a decrease in s_n@xmath1 , although much work is needed before this can be confirmed .",
    "btm noted that their results were consistent with the gclfs in their sample clusters being scaled versions of the m87 gclf translated in distance ; this supported the idea of a universal gclf for cluster ge s .",
    "in contrast , the recent work of ferrarese et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) warns against using the gclf as a distance indicator because the @xmath200-band gclf is intrinsically brighter by @xmath201 mag in the fornax poor cluster than in virgo , based on their cepheid distances and published gclf measurements .",
    "the situation for the @xmath202-band is even worse : the gclf is brighter by @xmath203 mag in fornax , and by nearly 1.2  mag in the leo group , than in virgo .",
    "blakeslee & tonry ( 1996 ) earlier noted this trend and proposed that it was due to environmental effects ; as further evidence , they pointed to the then preliminary hst results indicating that the gclf in the richer coma cluster was significantly _ fainter _",
    "than in virgo .",
    "in fact , the results of baum et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) do indicate that the gclf is fainter by @xmath204  mag in coma than in virgo when compared to the relative distances from most other methods ( e.g. , van den bergh 1992 ; jerjen & tammann 1993 ; donofrio et  al .  1997 ; kelson et  al .",
    "1999 ) . as all of the measurements",
    "are for ellipticals , the problem can not be solved by invoking different gclfs for different hubble types .",
    "ferrarese et  al .  ( 1999 ) note that the coma hst data do not adequately sample the gclf turnover and thus conclude the result is unreliable .",
    "moreover , the btm results are more consistent with the gclf being the same in coma as in virgo .",
    "the difference of @xmath127  mag noted in ",
    "[ ssec : resgclf ] between the mean _",
    "lf@xmath2  of the present sample and that of m87 is in the wrong sense  the gclf would have to be _",
    "brighter _ by @xmath205 mag in these dense clusters than in virgo and the btm clusters ( although still fainter than in fornax ) .",
    "thus , while ellipticals in poor groups appear to have intrinsically brighter gclfs than those in clusters , there is no strong evidence for further variation in the gclf among clusters over a very large range in richness .",
    "if we assume that the gclf is universal for bcgs , we can use a restricted form of the gclf distance method for the sample galaxies . instead of fixing m^0_r@xmath111  from the cmb velocity and constraining _",
    "lf@xmath2 , we can fix _",
    "lf@xmath2  to some value and vary m^0_r@xmath111  until the point source and fluctuation measurements give the same answer for the total number of gcs ; thus we obtain an estimate of the relative cluster distances .",
    "of course , this approach is subject to all the same potential problems from reaching unequal depths along possibly non - gaussian gclfs .",
    "that said , we note that five of the bcgs have _",
    "lf@xmath2  consistent with the median of 1.53 mag , while the a2152 bcg has @xmath206 mag .",
    "this assumes that distance goes as redshift @xmath207 ( from barmby & huchra 1998 ) so that a2152 is 30  mpc behind the other two hercules supercluster members a2147 and a2151 . requiring the a2152 _",
    "lf@xmath2  to be @xmath208 mag larger to match the others gives a distance @xmath209% larger than implied by its redshift , so that a2152 is @xmath21060 mpc in the background and falling towards the supercluster with a peculiar velocity near 2500  km  s@xmath7 . given the uncertainties and the sensitivity of m^0_r@xmath111  on changes in _ lf@xmath2 , this `` hercules infall '' is clearly not a significant result , and we continue to prefer the assumption that redshift reflects distance .    on the positive side , the gclf analysis does indicate that a2152 is not likely to be at the same distance as the other two hercules clusters and falling away from us at high speed through the `` plane '' of the supercluster . if we do assume that it is at the same distance , then its _",
    "lf@xmath2  drops to @xmath211 mag , which is significantly less than that of any of the other clusters , as well as less than for any of the 23 btm galaxies .",
    "( some galaxies , including m31 [ secker 1992 ] , do have gclfs this narrow or narrower , but none among this large sample of similar galaxies . )",
    "thus , this restricted form of the gclf method , requiring both the mean and the dispersion to be universal for bcgs , implies that a2152 is significantly behind the other two supercluster members , consistent with the mean redshifts from barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) and in contrast to previous works that found roughly equal mean redshifts for all three clusters ( e.g. , zabludoff et  al .",
    "it would be worth trying to disentangle this triple cluster system with more robust methods such as the fundamental plane or tully - fisher .",
    "deep lris @xmath36-band imaging has been presented for the centers of six rich abell clusters , all with velocity dispersions @xmath212 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we have used both the counts of point sources as a function of radius and the residual fluctuations in surface brightness after the removal of these point sources to study the gc populations around the central cluster galaxies .",
    "new features necessary for the analysis of the present data set include allowances for a spatially varying  and small corrections to the background surface densities for gravitational lensing effects .",
    "the point source counts give somewhat higher values for the extrapolated total numbers of gcs , if the width of the gclf is @xmath213 ; we have offered several reasons why the counts might be biased high . alternatively ,",
    "if there is no such bias , we have measured a median @xmath214  mag .",
    "this is about 0.1 mag broader than that found for the btm sample of galaxies in generally lower - mass clusters .",
    "a restricted application of the gclf distance method indicates that a2152 is likely more distant than the rest of the hercules supercluster .",
    "the correlations found by btm for s_n@xmath1  with velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity continue to hold up for these rich clusters .",
    "we have provided empirical scaling relations for s_n@xmath1  in the combined data set .",
    "the derived values for the number of gcs per unit mass @xmath3  are similar to those found for the btm sample ; the implied `` universal '' gc formation rate is @xmath1581  gc per 10@xmath215 .",
    "thus , the variation seen in s_n@xmath1  with cluster mass seems to result from `` missing light '' rather than anything unusual in the number of gcs .",
    "the gc color distributions found by other authors in central cluster galaxies lend further support to this view .",
    "guided by recent numerical simulations of bcg formation , we have argued that the observations are explained by a scenario in which the gcs formed at early times and fell into the cluster center along with their associated galaxies which merged to form the bcg . in this process of cluster collapse and bcg formation ,",
    "the gas may have become heated and lost to the intracluster environment ( btm , harris et  al .",
    "1998 ) so that star formation ceased early in the cluster center .",
    "although the simulations do not yet predict the star formation rates , they indicate that the bcg formation process is more rapid in richer clusters , consistent with the above scenario for producing higher - s_n@xmath1 , higher-@xmath6 central galaxies in these clusters .    over the subsequent lifetime of the cluster",
    ", a high - s_n@xmath1  central galaxy will slowly grow in luminosity and evolve towards lower s_n@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , continuing star formation in the general galaxy population of a young , spiral - rich cluster may allow the central galaxy to grow more luminous without the addition of a significant number of new gcs .",
    "we have suggested that the available data are beginning to show the first evidence for such evolution : the most spiral - rich , irregular cluster in our sample has the bcg with highest s_n@xmath1 , and the most centrally concentrated , apparently well - evolved clusters have bcgs with lower values of s_n@xmath1  and higher luminosities .",

    "<S> deep imaging data from the keck  ii telescope are employed to study the globular cluster ( gc ) populations in the cores of six rich abell clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the sample includes a754 , a1644 , a2124 , a2147 , a2151 , and a2152 and covers the redshift range @xmath00.066 . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters also span a range in morphology from spiral - rich , irregular systems to centrally concentrated cd clusters rich in early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> globular cluster specific frequencies s_n@xmath1  and luminosity function dispersions _ </S>",
    "<S> lf@xmath2  are measured for a total of 9 galaxies in six central fields . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values of s_n@xmath1  for the six brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are all higher than typical values for giant ellipticals , in accord with the s_n@xmath1-density correlations found by blakeslee , tonry , & metzger ( 1997 ) . the three non - bcgs analyzed also have elevated values of s_n@xmath1 , confirming that central location is a primary factor . </S>",
    "<S> two different models are used to estimate @xmath3 , the number of gcs per unit mass , for these central cluster fields . </S>",
    "<S> the values for @xmath3  are consistent with those found in the earlier sample , again indicating that the number of gcs scales with mass and that the s_n@xmath1variations are due to a deficit of halo light , i.e. , s_n@xmath1  reflects mass - to - light ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the gc color distributions of bcgs and more ordinary ellipticals further implies that no special mechanism is needed for explaining the properties of these gc populations .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion builds on an earlier suggestion that the gcs ( both metal rich and metal poor ) around the central cluster galaxies were assembled at early times , and that star formation halted prematurely in the central galaxies at the epoch of cluster collapse . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that this `` bcg saturation '' model is consistent with recent simulations of bcg / cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent addition of luminous material to the bcg through cluster dynamical evolution can cause s_n@xmath1  to decrease while conserving @xmath3 , but both theory and observations indicate that the time scale for this is long . </S>",
    "<S> however , there may be some evidence of it in the present sample and elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the gc luminosity function measurements are used to constrain the relative distances of the three clusters that make up the hercules supercluster . </S>"
