    "numerous models of static perfect fluid spheres , in the context of general relativity , have been constructed in the past because these are first approximations in building a realistic model for a star .",
    "lists of exact solutions to the einstein field equations modelling relativistic perfect fluid spheres are given in several treatments @xcite .",
    "in these works it is assumed that the matter distribution is isotropic so that the radial pressure is the same as the transverse pressure .",
    "a strong case can be made to study matter distributions which are anisotropic in which the radial component of the pressure is not the same as the transverse component .",
    "anisotropy should not be neglected when analysing the critical mass and the redshift of highly compact bodies , and it is important in modelling boson stars and strange stars .",
    "consequently anisotropy has been studied extensively in recent years by a number of researchers within the framework of general relativity @xcite .",
    "most solutions of the einstein field equations with isotropic matter have been obtained in an ad hoc approach .",
    "recent investigations have attempted to generate isotropic models using a systematic and algorithmic approach@xcite .",
    "however there exist very few analogous results for generating anisotropic models . in this regard maharaj and chaisi@xcite",
    "have established an algorithm that produces a new anisotropic solution from a given seed isotropic line element . here",
    "we present a different algorithm that generates a new anisotropic solution .",
    "the present algorithm has a simpler form and involves fewer integrations , and it is consequently easier to apply .",
    "a desirable physical feature of our approach is that these solutions have an isotropic limit ; we expect that gravity acts to eventually isotropize matter in the absence of other external forces .",
    "note that many of the exact solutions found previously remain anisotropic with no possibility of regaining an isotropic matter distribution in a suitable limit@xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to generate anisotropic solutions from a given isotropic solution . to achieve this we need to complete an integration which we show is possible for particular metrics . in ",
    "2 we provide the fundamental field equations for isotropic and anisotropic matter .",
    "the field equations are presented as a first order system of differential equations .",
    "the algorithm that produces a new anisotropic solution is described in  3 . as a first example we use the isothermal model to produce a new anisotropic solution in  4 . as a second example we use the schwarzschild interior model to produce a new anisotropic solution in  5 . in both examples",
    "the solution can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions which makes it possible to study the physical features .",
    "we briefly study the behaviour of the anisotropy factor in both examples .",
    "we utilise a form of the einstein field equations in which only first order derivatives appear .",
    "this representation assists in simplifying the integration process as pointed out by chaisi and maharaj@xcite whose notation and conventions we follow .",
    "the line element for static spherically symmetric spacetimes is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor , for nonradiating matter , for isotropic distributions has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath5 is the isotropic pressure .",
    "these are measured relative to the comoving four - velocity @xmath6 .",
    "we define the mass function as @xmath7 consequently @xmath8 is the total mass of a sphere of radius @xmath9 .",
    "the einstein field equations are equivalent to the system @xmath10 where we have used ( [ metric2])-([massfun ] ) .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for anisotropic matter which is not radiating has the form @xmath11 the quantity @xmath12 is the anisotropic stress tensor ; the spacelike vector @xmath13 is orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity @xmath6 and @xmath14 is the magnitude of the stress tensor .",
    "the einstein field equations , with the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) and the matter content ( [ taniso ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath15 for anisotropic matter distributions .",
    "the radial pressure @xmath16 is distinct from the tangential pressure @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 provides a measure of anisotropy .",
    "note that for isotropic matter @xmath20 and we regain ( [ efes:1])-([efes:3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we establish a procedure for generating a new anisotropic solution of the einstein field equations from a specified isotropic solution .",
    "we start by considering the einstein field equations ( [ efes:1])-([efes:3 ] ) with isotropic matter distribution .",
    "we assume that an explicit solution to ( [ efes:1])-([efes:3 ] ) is known where @xmath21 and functions @xmath22 are explicitly given .",
    "then the equations in ( [ efes:1])-([efes:3 ] ) are satisfied and we can write @xmath23 we next consider the einstein field equations ( [ efes2:1])-([efes2:3 ] ) with anisotropic matter distribution and seek an explicit solution . to this end",
    "we propose the possible solution @xmath24 where @xmath25 are given by ( [ eq : isosol ] ) and @xmath26 are arbitrary functions , and we have set @xmath27 for convenience .",
    "then the system ( [ efes2:1])-([efes2:3 ] ) becomes @xmath28[eq : aniso2 ] the systems ( [ eq : iso1])-([eq : iso3 ] ) and ( [ eq : aniso2:1])-([eq : aniso2:3 ] ) lead to @xmath29 we need to integrate ( [ eq : alphayprime ] ) to find the function @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "two cases arise : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath33 then ( [ eq : x])-([eq : alphayprime ] ) has the solution @xmath35 the trivial solution ( [ eq : alphaxy0soln ] ) corresponds to the isotropic case .",
    "thus this algorithm regains the isotropic solution in the appropriate limit .",
    "if @xmath34 then we can eliminate @xmath32 from ( [ eq : alphayprime ] ) to get @xmath36 this differential equation can be written as @xmath37 after some simplification .",
    "on integration ( [ eq : alphaprime ] ) leads to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant of integration , @xmath40 , and we have set @xmath41 we can write ( [ eq : jint ] ) in the compact form @xmath42 equations ( [ eq : x ] ) , ( [ eq : y ] ) and ( [ eq : alphaj ] ) correspond to anisotropic matter .    thus if given a known isotropic solution ( [ eq : isosol ] ) we can generate a new anisotropic solution ( [ eq : anisosol ] ) where @xmath43 and the integral @xmath44 is given by @xmath41 the integration in @xmath44 can be explicitly performed as @xmath45 is specified in the isotropic solution ( [ eq : isosol ] ) . note that ( [ eq : alphaxy:1])-([eq : alphaxy:3 ] ) applies to both cases @xmath46 and @xmath34 . if @xmath46 we can set @xmath47 and regain the isotropic result ( [ eq : alphaxy0soln ] ) .",
    "when @xmath34 then @xmath40 and we regain the anisotropic equations ( [ eq : x ] ) , ( [ eq : y ] ) and ( [ eq : alphaj ] ) .    it is remarkable that our simple ansatz leads to a new anisotropic solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "this is subject to completing the integration in @xmath44 ; clearly this is possible for particular choices of the isotropic function @xmath45 .",
    "we demonstrate two examples of anisotropic solutions for familiar choices of @xmath45 in the next two sections .",
    "the algorithm that we have generated in this paper is easy to apply as there is only a single integration to be performed unlike the earlier algorithm of maharaj and chaisi@xcite which is more complicated and involves further integrations .",
    "we believe that new anisotropic solutions that arise from our procedure are likely to produce realistic anisotropic stellar models .",
    "we emphasise that a desirable feature of our approach is that our models contain an isotropic limit which is often not the case in other approaches .",
    "as a first example we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm in  3 by generating anisotropic isothermal spheres . the line element for the isothermal model@xcite has the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant .",
    "the corresponding isotropic functions for ( [ eq : isothermalle ] ) are given by @xmath50 the energy density function has the form @xmath51 hence ( [ eq : isothermalisosol ] ) and ( [ eq : mu0iso ] ) imply that @xmath52 which is a linear barotropic equation of state .",
    "isothermal spheres with the density profile @xmath53 and the equation of state ( [ eq : p0mu0 ] ) appear in a variety of models for both newtonian and relativistic stars@xcite .",
    "they have been studied extensively in astrophysics as an equilibrium approximation to more complicated systems which are close to a dynamically relaxed state@xcite .    with the isotropic functions ( [ eq : isothermalisosol ] ) we can evaluate the integral @xmath44 in ( [ eq : alphaxy:1 ] ) and we find @xmath54 which leads to the expressions @xmath55 consequently we obtain the new line element in the form @xmath56 and the matter variables have the analytic representation @xmath57 the isotropic isothermal sphere model ( [ eq : isothermalle ] ) produces the anisotropic isothermal sphere model ( [ eq : lelement ] ) utilizing our algorithm . with the parameter values",
    "@xmath47 , we regain the conventional isothermal sphere .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is @xmath58 mathematica@xcite was used to graph the anisotropy factor ( [ eq : isothermalsa ] ) .",
    "the plots are as shown in figures [ fig : sisob ] and [ fig : sisobup ] for particular values of the parameters shown .",
    "the anisotropy factor @xmath19 is plotted against the radial distance on the interval @xmath59 .",
    "there is a singularity at @xmath60 that has been carried over from the other dynamical and metric functions .",
    "however because constants @xmath61 and @xmath49 can be picked arbitrarily , the pair can be chosen such that @xmath62 is monotonically decreasing or increasing .",
    "the physical considerations of a problem may lead to the choice of one profile as opposed to the other ; for example the @xmath62 profile in figure [ fig : sisob ] may be preferable where a stellar body with vanishing anisotropy as one moves from the center of the body to the boundary is considered . the @xmath62 profile in figure [ fig : sisobup ]",
    "could be chosen over the one in figure [ fig : sisob ] for boson star models as proposed by dev and gleiser@xcite .",
    "the fairly simple behaviour of the @xmath62 in these plots shows that a more extensive physical analysis of the solutions is possible , which will be carried out in future work .",
    "as a second example we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm in  [ sec : algorithm ] by generating anisotropic schwarzschild spheres .",
    "the line element for the interior schwarzschild model@xcite is @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants .",

    "we therefore have @xmath69 for incompressible matter .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in particular situations as the interior of dense neutron stars and superdense relativistic stars are of near uniform density@xcite .",
    "consequently the assumption ( [ eq : schwarzsmu0 ] ) of uniform energy density is often used to build prototypes of realistic stars in the modelling process@xcite .",
    "the integral @xmath44 in ( [ eq : alphaxy:1 ] ) takes the form @xmath70 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left [ r^2\\delta\\left(a+b\\delta\\right ) \\left(1+\\frac{2br^2}{r^2\\delta\\left(a+b\\delta\\right)}\\right)\\left(2 + \\frac{2br^2}{r^2\\delta\\left(a+b\\delta\\right ) } \\right ) \\right]^{-1 } \\label{eq : jalphaschw}\\\\ & & \\left.- \\left(\\frac{6}{r } + \\frac{2br}{r^2\\delta\\left(a - b\\delta\\right)}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{2br^2}{r^2 \\delta\\left(a - b\\delta\\right)}\\right)\\left(2+\\frac{2br^2}{r^2\\delta\\left(a -b\\delta\\right)}\\right)^{-1 } \\right\\}\\mbox{d}r\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with",
    "the substitution @xmath71 , ( [ eq : jalphaschw ] ) becomes @xmath72 the above integral can be simplified with the help of partial fractions .",
