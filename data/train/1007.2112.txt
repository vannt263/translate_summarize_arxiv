    "thus , ysos can be identified by looking for infrared excess emission .",
    "ysos are categorized into class 0 , i , ii or iii evolutionary stages .",
    "class 0 objects are deeply embedded protostars that are still experiencing cloud collapse . since they",
    "are so embedded , they are extremely faint at wavelengths shorter than 10  @xmath7 . they have a significant submillimeter luminosity : @xmath12 0.5% .",
    "a class i yso is also an object whose emission is dominated by a dense infalling spherical envelope but is infrared bright . with only infrared data it is usually not possible to distinguish class 0 from class i objects .",
    "a class ii yso is characterized by the presence of an optically thick , primordial circumstellar disk , which dominates the star s emission . when most of the circumstellar disk material has become optically thin , the star is classified as a class iii star .",
    "thus , a class iii object is a pre - main sequence star that has lost its accretion disk , but may exhibit a small amount of infrared excess due to a secondary / debris disk . in this paper",
    "we additionally catalog a further class of yso , the `` transition disk '' ( td ) .",
    "these objects display an intermediate infrared excess morphology between class ii and iii as they exhibit disks , but with evidence for significant dust clearing in the inner disk region .",
    "they exhibit emission consistent with reddened photospheres that have ir excess at 24  @xmath7 and longer wavelengths .",
    "there is some debate in the literature as to their exact place in the evolutionary path from class ii to class iii however ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the circumstellar material around a young star disappears as the star evolves , and consequently the infrared excess emission decreases .",
    "thus , by measuring the star s ir excess  once it has become visible in the infrared  we can determine its evolutionary state .",
    "since younger stars are brighter at longer ir wavelengths , we can classify ysos by calculating the slope of the source s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which is defined as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the star s flux density at wavelength , @xmath15 .",
    "color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , which compare the ratio of a star s flux in different bands , can be used to look for ir excess to classify ysos in place of calculating @xmath16 for each object .",
    "we used irac , mips , two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ? * ) and ukirt deep sky survey dr4 ( ukidss , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) photometry to classify the ysos in cygnus x using the classification scheme presented in @xcite , with the extinction map of @xcite generated from 2mass data used to deredden the photometry .",
    "figures  [ fig - ccdirac ] and [ fig - ccdmip ] show example color - color and color - magnitude diagrams that were used to classify the ysos .",
    "the points are plotted without dereddening their photometry .",
    "the scheme also provides a means of filtering out extragalactic sources ( for example , active galactic nuclei or agn ) on the basis of magnitude and color cuts .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     using these methods , we found 670 class i , 7,249 class ii and 350,058 normal photospheres in the cygnus x north region .",
    "we also identified 200 deeply embedded objects ( with seds resembling class i sources but showing evidence for large optical extinction ) and 112 transition disks .",
    "these classifications are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig - ccdirac ] , one red class i source shows error bars .",
    "we calculated the errors in color by adding the median uncertainty in magnitude for the two channels in quadrature .",
    "we also show the extinction vector in each plot for that filter combination using the extinction law derived by @xcite .",
    "the typical line of sight extinction to sources in cygnus x is @xmath17 = 0.5 to 1.0 @xcite .",
    "thus , except for the most embedded sources , neither photometry error or reddening are responsible for the distribution of sources on these color - color diagrams and the dominant contributor to their colors is the intrinsic spread in properties of the sources . in figure",
    "[ fig - histoyso ] , we show the number of ysos ( including class i , ii , deeply embedded protostars and transition disks ) detected in each of the four irac bands per magnitude , in comparison to all detected stellar sources .",
    "firstly we note that channels 3 and 4 detect far fewer sources than channels 1 and 2 .",
    "this deficit exists because channels 1 and 2 are more sensitive than channels 3 and 4 and are also less affected by the bright diffuse emission that dominates the channel 3 and 4 images .",
    "the underlying typical stellar photosphere is also intrinsically fainter at 5.8 and 8  @xmath7 than at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath7 , which further hinders our ability to detect sources in the longer wavelength irac filters .",
    "secondly , there is a flattening off in the yso histograms at the brightest magnitudes in all bands .",
    "we attribute this trend to contamination , likely from agb stars . as found by @xcite , a majority of objects brighter than [ 4.5 ] = 7.8 in a typical galactic field are so - called @xmath18extreme@xmath19 agb stars , while sources fainter than this cut are either @xmath18standard@xmath19 agb stars or ysos . in cygnus",
    "x this contamination reveals itself in the apparent increased proportion of ysos amongst the overall stellar populations in each irac histogram at the brightest magnitudes ( brighter than 8th magnitude in any band ) .      to study the effect massive stars have on their environment in cygnus x",
    ", we need to first identify the most massive stars .",
    "then , we can investigate how the young stellar objects form in their presence . using @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes from the iphas survey @xcite , we identified a sample of possible o and b type stars in the 2@xmath22 field near dr21 in cygnus x @xcite .",
    "we obtained 536 optical spectra during fall 2008 using the fast instrument , an optical spectrograph in operation at the focus of the 1.5  m tillinghast reflector at the fred l. whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins @xcite and the hectospec multifiber spectrograph mounted on the 6.5  m mmt telescope on mount hopkins @xcite .",

    "data reduction was performed by s. tokarz through the cfa telescope data center , using iraf tasks and other customized reduction scripts .",
    "the reduction procedure was the standard for the hectospec data , with the addition of our special sky subtraction procedure . to avoid the difficulties encountered when subtracting a sky spectrum made from an average over the highly variable hii region , we took exposures offset by @xmath115 after each hectospec configuration .",
    "this way we obtained a sky spectrum very close to each star through the same fiber .",
    "background subtraction was performed in idl to remove each wavelength calibrated sky offset spectrum from its corresponding wavelength calibrated object spectrum .    to classify our sources",
    ", we used the spectral classification code sptclasshernandj / sptclass / sptclass.html . ] @xcite .",
    "this automated code can classify spectra to a precision of half a subtype ( e.g. g6.5@xmath230.5 ) .",
    "it uses only spectral line ratios , not continuum shape and is currently unable to distinguish the luminosity class of the star being classified .",
    "of the 536 spectra , 24 sources were classified as b type stars .",
    "the most massive star identified was a b0.0@xmath232.0 .",
    "the fact that we did not find any o type stars may be a result of our selection criteria . we selected sources from the iphas survey , which does not include any sources brighter than magnitude 10 .",
    "therefore , our survey may be missing some of the brightest sources .",
    "figure  [ fig - cmd1 ] shows the optical color - magnitude distribution of iphas photometry for sources for which we obtained spectra .",

    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes our spectral classification results .",
    "the drop in number of objects classified later than spectral type f ( g , k and m ) is due to the spectral sample selection which preferentially chose the bright , blue targets and the sensitivity limits of our spectral survey .",

    "to verify that the sources for which we have optical spectra are indeed members of the cygnus x complex , we plot the spectroscopic sample on a dereddened color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we used the catalog of spectral types and intrinsic colors presented in kenyon and hartmann ( 1995 ) to determine each star s intrinsic @xmath25 color via the sloan filter conversions presented in @xcite .",
    "these colors allow us to calculate the visual extinction , @xmath24 toward each object using the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath24 given in @xcite .",

    "we can see that in general the sources fall between the isochrones at 1 and 5  myr , which we would expect given the large amount of embedded star formation in this part of cygnus x. in particular , the location of the b stars ( shown with blue stars in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmd2 ] ) is consistent with their being at the accepted distance of cygnus x of 1.7  kpc and thus being members of the region .",

    "although young stars are distributed throughout the field of view , the figure shows obvious regions of higher stellar densities .",
    "b stars are marked with orange asterisks .",
    "the image shows that the dense clumps of ysos tend to be concentrated near the massive b stars . however , there are some b stars that appear distant from any clustering .",
    "since cygnus x lies along the galactic plane , our source list of ysos is likely contaminated by some foreground and background young stellar populations .",
    "we estimate an upper limit to this contamination by measuring the source density in regions of the lowest density of ysos in the complete cygnus x survey @xcite that lie along the galactic plane .",
    "this method will clearly produce an overestimate of the level of contamination as many of these sources will belong to cygnus x. we find a density of 537 sources per square degree .",
    "we consider this level of contamination low enough to ignore for the purposes of this particular study .",
    "many class i and ii objects are clustered together within clouds of bright ir emission , while others form filamentary structures . for example , the dr22 region shows a dense cluster of class ii sources inside a large cavity where the gas appears to have been blown out , presumably due to the presence of a massive star .",
    "this cluster was also noted by @xcite and @xcite . in this region",

    "one branch of class i objects extends north in the direction of the dr23 region , along the dr22-dr23 molecular co filament detected by @xcite .",

    "cygnus x provides a rich and varied collection of yso clusters for our study of star formation . to understand the intricate substructure of the cygnus x region",
    ", we selected two smaller areas in this field of view to study in more detail .",
    "the first region , shown in figure  [ fig - diamond ] , lies just slightly southwest of dr21 and is termed the diamond ring .",
    "we can see a bright ring of emission , around which lie many dense clusters of ysos , in addition to six identified b stars .",
    "the second region , afgl  2636 , is in the northeast corner of figure  [ fig - bigo ] . inside an arch of bright emission",
    ", there is a dense group of class ii objects and three b stars .",
    "a chain of class i sources along the rim of the cloud extends in a long ring to another dense cluster to the east .      to understand the evolution of star formation in cygnus x",
    ", we would like to be able to identify distinct clusters of young stars and draw conclusions on their evolution based on comparisons of their relative sizes and ages . however , there are many obstacles to being able to glean such information .",
    "first , we have no insight on the gravitational relationships between the stars .",
    "therefore , we must determine cluster memberships based on the spatial distribution of the sources .",
    "although we assume all the sources are at about the same distance ( 1.7  kpc ) due to their ir excess emission , we do not know the exact three - dimensional position of each star within the cloud .",
    "second , stars do not form neatly in distinct , independent clusters .",
    "clusters vary greatly in size , shape and density and can interact and overlap with other clusters , which renders defining cluster membership somewhat arbitrary .",
    "therefore , to quantitatively describe the clusters in cygnus x in such a way that we can compare with similar studies of other star - forming regions , we chose to use the cluster isolation method described and extensively tested in @xcite .",
    "this method , which relies on the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) construction @xcite , has been used recently by koenig et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to characterize clusters with irac and mips photometry in w5 .",
    "since our cluster isolation technique relies only on a measure of the local surface density of stars , it is a @xmath28 method .",
    "given the lack of information on the dynamical properties and masses of the stars , an algorithm to isolate contiguous , locally overdense structures is the most appropriate tool that we can use in this case .",
    "located southwest of dr21 lies the region dubbed the @xmath18diamond ring  by @xcite",
    ". the diamond ring , which is shown in figure  [ fig - diamond ] , is believed to have been formed by a region identified by a 3 cm radio survey by @xcite .",
    "marston et al .",
    "point out that the filaments extending from dr21 , which can be seen in the top - left of figure  [ fig - diamond ] , are truncated by the diamond ring and therefore , conclude that this structure is at the same distance as dr21 .",
    "the very bright tip of the diamond ring has been identified previously as the site of a stellar cluster using 2mass @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 data ( object 16 and cl 13 in @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . using the 2mass photometry and assuming a distance modulus of 11@xmath32",
    ", @xcite inferred that this cluster contains 12 b stars and no o stars .",
    "we found two b stars in the bright tip of the diamond , a b0.5 and a b9.0 .",
    "we identified five b stars in the entire region , which are shown as blue asterisks in figure  [ fig - mst - len1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "_ red _ : 8.0 @xmath10 m ; _ green _ : 4.5 @xmath10 m ; _ blue _ : 3.6 @xmath10 m . ]    we applied the @xcite algorithm to identify and characterize clusters in the diamond ring . for each source in the region ,",
    "the mst method first finds the distance to its nearest neighbor .",
    "every source is connected by a line to another source in such a way that the total length of all the lines is minimized and there are no closed loops .",
    "the distance to its nearest neighbor is called the star s branch length .",
    "clusters are defined as a collection of stars that are connected by branches that are less than some cutoff distance and containing at least some minimum number of stars , n. we define the minimum number of stars to be n=10 , attempting to minimize the identification of false groupings due to statistical fluctuations in the low density yso distribution . to determine the cutoff distance , we plot the distribution of branch lengths in figure  [ fig - mst - len1 ] ( right ) .",
    "the distribution shows two distinct regions  a short and a long branch length domain  corresponding to clustered and distributed sources respectively . while there is no definitive cutoff branch length that perfectly determines cluster membership , choosing a cutoff length that falls somewhere between these two regions is a good estimate of the divide between objects belonging to clusters and the distributed population .",
    "we fit lines through the short and long branch length parts of the distribution and extrapolate to find their intersection .",
    "the point of intersection is selected to be the cutoff length , _ d@xmath33 _ , which here equals 0.43  pc .",
    "thus , we defined clusters in the diamond ring region as any group of 10 or more stars connected by lengths of no more than 0.43  pc .",
    "this cutoff distance is about half that derived by koenig et al .",

    "we used the ratio of class ii / i sources in each cluster to approximate a formation history of the clusters in each region assuming that a higher ratio of class ii to class i objects indicates a more evolved ( and thus older ) cluster .",

    "<S> we present new images and photometry of the massive star forming complex cygnus x obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. a combination of irac , mips , ukirt deep infrared sky survey ( ukidss ) , and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data are used to identify and classify young stellar objects . of the 8,231 sources detected exhibiting infrared excess in cygnus x north , 670 are classified as class i and 7,249 are classified as class ii . using spectra from the fast spectrograph at the fred l. whipple observatory and hectospec on the mmt , we spectrally typed 536 sources in the cygnus x complex to identify the massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ysos tend to be grouped in the neighborhoods of massive b stars ( spectral types b0 to b9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present a minimal spanning tree analysis of clusters in two regions in cygnus x north . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of infrared excess sources that belong to clusters with @xmath010 members is found to be 5070@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> most class ii objects lie in dense clusters within blown out regions , while class i sources tend to reside in more filamentary structures along the bright - rimmed clouds , indicating possible triggered star formation . </S>"
