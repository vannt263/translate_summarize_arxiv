    "the highest resolution molecular maps of ngc 253 utilize a @xmath13 2@xmath8 beam ( @xmath13 24 pc ) , so structure on sub - parsec scales remains unresolved .",

    "we conclude that in addition to an elevated density of cosmic rays , the dissipation of turbulent energy through low velocity shocks can produce the warm molecular gas emitting in mid - j co lines .    by keeping a large fraction of the molecular gas warm and therefore less susceptible to gravitational instability , cosmic rays and the decay of turbulence work to halt the starburst .",
