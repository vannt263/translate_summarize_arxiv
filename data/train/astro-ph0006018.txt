    "if the galactic dark halo were composed entirely of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , the instantaneous probablity of microlensing ( the `` optical depth '' ) towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) would have been @xmath15 ( pacznski 1986 ) .",
    "the most recent observational result for machos with masses up to about 1 @xmath5 is @xmath16 , which comes from an analysis of 5.7 years of lmc microlensing survey data ( alcock et al .",
    "thus an all - macho galactic dark halo is ruled out . however , the observed optical depth is significantly higher than the estimate for known galactic and lmc stellar populations , @xmath17 ( alcock et al .",
    "the excess lmc microlensing signal may be telling us the macho fraction of the galactic dark halo or revealing gaps in our understanding of the essential structure of the lmc and galaxy .",
    "critical discussions of the microlensing optical depth from known stellar populations have developed along two lines .",
    "one debate has been about the possible existence of a `` new '' stellar population which would account for the lmc microlensing result .",
    "some example suggestions include an intervening dwarf galaxy or tidal stream ( zhao 1998 ; zaritsky & lin 1997 , zaritsky et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a very warped galactic disk ( evans et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these hypotheses have been tested , and in some cases ruled out ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ; beaulieu & sackett 1998 ; bennett 1998 ; gould 1998 , 1999 ; gyuk , flynn , & evans  1999 ; ibata , germaint , & beaulieu 1999 ; johnston 1998 ) .",
    "the second debate has been about the importance of lmc star - star `` self - lensing '' ( sahu 1994 ; wu 1994 ) . in particular , although the lmc is well represented by an exponential disk model which often serves as the basis for the self - lensing optical depth calculation , it may exhibit some important detailed structures .",
    "our paper is motivated by this lmc self - lensing problem .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of lmc stars yields a strong constraint on star - star self - lensing from the virialized lmc disk : @xmath18 ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "gould s elegant limit is probably uncertain by no more than a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "however , several lmc models have been devised which would increase the self - lensing optical depth over the gould limit .",
    "one example of a detailed structure that might increase the self - lensing optical depth is a highly - inclined and flared lmc disk ( zhao 1999 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the oldest lmc disk stars have a very large characteristic scale height , or that the lmc harbors an as yet unseen but massive stellar spheroid  2 - 4 for the former , and a very large",
    "m / l for the latter ) , and the density profiles . ]",
    "( e.g.  aubourg et al",
    ".  1999 ; salati et al .  1999 ; evans & kerins 2000 ) . finally , it is possible that a nonvirialized stellar component ( i.e. , a shroud of tidal debris ; weinberg 2000 ) acts to increase the self - lensing optical depth ( zhao 1998 ) .",
    "kinematic studies play a critical role in testing these various proposed lmc models . for example",
    ", the flare of the lmc disk may be inferred from its velocity dispersion at different radii , and the existence of a non - equilibrium stellar component lying near the lmc might be proven with a large kinematic survey ( zhao 1999 ; graff et al .  1999 ; see also zaritsky et al .",
    "1999 ; ibata et al .",
    "in addition , one could search directly for an lmc stellar population with a velocity dispersion of @xmath750 km  s@xmath1 , the prediction for a spheroid or very thick disk .",
    "these latter components must be identified before their importance to the self - lensing optical depth can be assessed .",
    "the lmc rotation curve provides a framework for detailed kinematic studies such as these .",
    "the decomposition of the lmc rotation curve into disk and dark halo components has several implications for microlensing .",
    "first , as emphasized by gyuk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the total mass of the lmc is an important constraint on self - lensing optical depth calculations .",
    "a high - mass model will typically predict a high self - lensing optical depth , with an additional dependence on whether the mass lies mostly in the disk or in a halo .",
    "unfortunately , recent analyses of the lmc rotation curve have lead to mass estimates that range over a factor of @xmath74 , which can be attributed primarily to different assumptions about a dark halo ( kim et al .",
    "1998 , kunkel et al .",
    "1997 , schommer et al .",
    "second , a massive lmc dark halo might significantly affect the lmc disk kinematics ( e.g.  bahcall 1984 ) , with possible consequence for constraints on self - lensing or determining the flare of the disk",
    ". the influence of an lmc dark halo on the lmc disk kinematics has not been investigated in detail .",
    "we note that the interplay between the disk and dark halo is also of general interest for studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "finally , if the lmc has a dark halo with a physical makeup similar to that of the galactic dark halo ( i.e.  composed partly of machos ) , the macho fraction of the galactic dark halo implied by the observed optical depth would be lowered ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) .    motivated by the above considerations , we present a new analysis of the lmc rotation curve . in this work",
    "we are particularly concerned with the flare of the lmc disk . however , other issues pertinent to microlensing are discussed as our calculations and analyses permit .",
    "we refer extensively to the rotation curve recently presented by kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the impressive radial velocity dataset for lmc carbon stars summarized by kunkel , demers , irwin & albert ( 1997 ; hereafter kdia ) .",
    "a significant subset of these latter data are public ( kunkel , irwin & demers 1997 ) , and archived electronically at the cds .",
    "we also refer extensively to the analysis of the lmc space motion presented by kroupa & bastian ( 1997 ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we present the impetus for this work , a comparison of constant - thickness exponential disk models ( with no dark halos ) to the lmc disk velocity dispersions reported by kdia . in  3 , we reanalyze the lmc rotation curve and velocity dispersion curve using archived carbon - star radial - velocity data . in  4 , we present a multi - mass component kinematic model for the lmc . in  5 , we compare our carbon - star rotating disk solution to our model .",
    "we discuss the microlensing implications of our analyses in  6 and conclude in  7 .",
    "disks in galaxies often have exponential surface brightness profiles from which we infer exponential mass surface density profiles of the form @xmath19 by assuming constant mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath20 ) . in equation",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath21 is the central mass surface density , @xmath22 is the radial scale length , and @xmath9 is a cylindrical radial coordinate . for an infinitely thin disk described by equation ( 1 ) , freeman ( 1970 )",
    "calculated that the rotation curve reaches a maximum circular velocity at @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total mass of the disk , which is related to the central surface density by @xmath26 for the case of a disk with a modest finite thickness , @xmath27 will be decreased by @xmath28 ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ) .",
    "a useful model with a finite thickness is the exponential disk ( also known as a double - exponential disk ) , which has a density distribution @xmath29 in equation  ( 4 ) , the variable @xmath8 is the vertical , or what we will sometimes refer to as the `` z '' scale height . if we choose the spatial density normalization @xmath30 , the exponential disk projects to the surface density of the infinitely thin freeman disk , i.e.  equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "the z - velocity dispersion , @xmath31 , for the exponential disk is given by wainscoat , freeman and hyland ( 1989 ) , @xmath32^{1/2}\\ ] ] which assumes that the disk is virialized .",
    "equation  ( 5 ) is strictly valid for a radially infinite disk .",
    "the radial dependence ( i.e. , the @xmath33 term ) in equation  ( 5 ) scales the local density normalization , as prescribed by others ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ; van der kruit & freeman 1984 ) .",
    "a model extensively discussed by van der kruit & searle ( 1981 , 1981b , 1982 ) is the isothermal disk .",
    "the vertical distribution of stars in an isothermal disk is described by the sech@xmath34 function , as originally derived by spitzer ( 1942 ; see also  4.2 of this paper ) .",
    "the spatial density for this disk model is , @xmath35 which projects to the surface density of the infinitely thin freeman disk if @xmath36 .",
    "assuming virialization , the z - velocity dispersion of the isothermal disk is proportional to the z - scale height and independent of z : @xmath37^{1/2}\\ ] ] where the radial dependence scales the local density normalization .",
    "equation  ( 7 ) is strictly valid for a radially infinite disk .",
    "we note that the `` z - scale height '' in the isothermal disk is not strictly a scale height ( and not the same as @xmath8 in the double - exponential model ) , but it is a similar parameter .",
    "further comparisons of the exponential and isothermal disk models are found in wainscoat , freeman & hyland ( 1989 ) , and van der kruit ( 1988 ) .",
    "the systematic error in the velocity dispersion predicted by the radially infinite isothermal disk model has been shown to be only @xmath710% in the range @xmath38 using numerical studies of truncated isothermal disk models ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ) .",
    "we will use the isothermal disk model in our analyses , because these numerical calculations provide us with an estimate of the model accuracy , and will later allow us to approximately account for the finite radial extent of the lmc disk ( see  4.3 of this paper ) .",
    "observations of edge - on spirals indicate that both the exponential and isothermal models are viable representations of real disks ( de grijs , peletier , & van der kruit 1997 )",
    ". the specific choice of model does not affect the main results of this work .",
    "it is reasonable to compare the model z - velocity dispersion to the observed velocity dispersion at different projected radii in the lmc for the case of uniform anisotropy ( @xmath39 constant at different radii ; van der kruit & freeman 1984 ) .",
    "although we do not know if this is true for the lmc , the assumption of uniform anisotropy is supported by kinematic studies of the old galactic disk ( lewis & freeman 1989 ) .",
    "gould ( 1995 ) notes that if @xmath40 1 as found elsewhere , the line of sight velocity dispersion measured for an inclined disk overestimates @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , our model z - velocity dispersion is likely an upper - limit on the true z - velocity dispersion .    combining equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) yields @xmath42 which is most accurate for disks in the range @xmath38 .",
    "the z - scale height has been observed to be constant over a large range of @xmath9 in numerous disk galaxies ( van der kruit & freeman 1984 ; de grijs , peletier , & van der kruit 1997 ) , implying that @xmath43 decreases with increasing @xmath9 in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , this trend of decreasing velocity dispersion has been observed in over a dozen spiral / disk galaxies ( bottema 1993 ) , including our own .    in summary , if the disk velocity dispersions are the same at different radii , the disk is likely flared ( e.g.  zhao 1999 )",
    "however , this inference assumes that ( 1 )  the disk is virialized , ( 2 )  the radial scale length is constant , ( 3 )  the disk velocity dispersions exhibit uniform anisotropy , and ( 4 )  the galaxy has no dark halo ( or that the dark halo has a negligible affect on the disk velocity dispersions ) .",
    "finally , one must be careful to compare the observed velocity dispersions to the simple model described above over a restricted range of radii , because real galactic disks are finite in radial extent .",
    "we compare to the lmc in the next section .      in this section , we will adopt a plausible value for the product @xmath44 in equation ( 8) , and compare that model to lmc disk velocity dispersion data .",
    "following kdia and many others , we adopt a distance to the lmc of 50.1 kpc , and an inclination of @xmath14 = 33 degrees . for comparison ,",
    "wide - field uv polarimetric image data have yielded a precise but model - dependent estimate of the inclination of the lmc disk : @xmath45 degrees ( cole , wood , & nordsieck 1999 ) .",
    "westerlund ( 1997 ) summarizes a number of other inclination measurements .",
    "we adopt @xmath46 kpc for the radial scale length of the lmc disk .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the lmc disk is well - fit by an exponential with a scale length @xmath47  kpc ( de  vaucouleurs 1957 , bothun & thompson 1988 ) .",
    "moreover , the surface density profile of intermediate - age long period variables ( lpvs ) in the lmc is also fit by an exponential with a scale length of @xmath48  kpc ( hughes , wood & reid 1991 ) .",
    "this result directly associates our kinematic dataset with an lmc population that follows the @xmath22 = 1.6  kpc exponential profile , because some of the intermediate - age lpvs are also carbon stars .",
    "finally , the rr lyrae stars in the lmc also appear to lie in a @xmath47  kpc exponential disk ( alcock et al .",
    "since the rr  lyraes are presumably much older than the carbon stars , the carbon stars were likely born into the same disk .",
    "we note that no stellar population in the lmc has yet been shown to be inconsistent with a @xmath46  kpc exponential profile .",
    "we assume that the carbon stars observed by kdia properly represent this lmc disk .",
    "the kdia dataset consists of radial velocity measurements for 759 carbon stars spanning a true lmc radius of 2 to 10 kpc .",
    "kdia summarize the results of 11 different zonal solutions for a rotating disk . in figure  1",
    ", we plot the kdia velocity dispersions as a function of radial distance , which we take as the central value for each zonal solution given in kdia s table  1 .",
    "we show data only for @xmath9 = 3 to 6 kpc .",
    "this is the range of radii where equation  ( 8) will most accurately predict the velocity dispersions . the dashed line in figure  1",
    "is the mean of the plotted , observed velocity dispersions , @xmath49 13.7 km  s@xmath1 . assuming a constant value of @xmath43 equal to the mean , we find @xmath50 = 0.4 , consistent with the data .",
    "the solid line plotted in figure  1 shows the prediction of equation  ( 8) assuming values of @xmath51 km s@xmath1 and @xmath8 = 0.35 kpc at @xmath52 .",
    "this model predicts @xmath53  km  s@xmath1 at @xmath54 kpc .",
    "the fit for this model distribution is @xmath50 = 8.7 , which can be rejected with high significance .",
    "models with larger scale heights intersecting the data at larger @xmath9 give similarly poor fits are not strictly apppropriate because the zonal solutions given by kdia are not all independent .",
    "however , subsets of the @xmath55 measurements which are independent also give poor fits to the distribution given by equation  ( 7 ) . ] .",
    "one possible interpretation of the observed constancy of @xmath43 with @xmath9 is that the z - scale height increases as @xmath56 , i.e. _ the lmc disk is flared . _",
    "an alternate interpretation of figure  1 might be a constant - thickness disk under the dynamical influence of a dark halo ( bahcall 1984 ) . indeed , kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) compared their rotation curve with the kdia carbon star rotation curve and , on this basis , argued that an lmc dark halo is dynamically significant at a radius of @xmath74 kpc .",
    "however , kdia favored a different interpretation ; they attributed the rising outer portion of their carbon star rotation curve to tidal effects , and not a dark halo curve in figure  1 , supporting this aspect of our analysis in  2 . ] . before concluding that the lmc disk is flared , it is worth testing disk plus dark halo kinematic models in a self - consistent manner . with this model comparison in mind ,",
    "let us consider the kdia analysis in greater detail .",
    "we have several specific concerns with the kdia analysis .",
    "first , and perhaps most importantly , kdia excluded some carbon stars from their solutions for their association with a polar ring .",
    "this procedure might have artificially lowered the disk velocity dispersions . by retaining these stars in our solutions , we guarantee that our results will be properly comparable to our model ( which will not include a polar ring ) .",
    "kdia also corrected for the lmc transverse motion by forcing the position angle of the kinematic line of nodes to match the photometric line of nodes in each zonal solution .",
    "this is a questionable procedure .",
    "moreover , it is inconsistent with the analysis by kim et al .  (",
    "we will correct the carbon - star velocities for the transverse motion of the lmc in a manner consistent with the rotation curve analysis by kim et al .",
    "in fact , we will make our carbon star rotation curve analysis similar in other ways to the rotation curve analysis ( i.e. , by adopting the same kinematic center ) , in order to lend maximum credibility to detailed comparisons of the two rotation curves .",
    "we assemble positions ( right ascension and declination ; equinox 1950 ) and galactocentric radial velocities for magellanic cloud carbon stars from kunkel , irwin & demers ( 1997 ) .",
    "we discard all small magellanic cloud ( smc ) carbon stars , `` inter - cloud '' carbon stars ( their table  15 ) , and carbon stars located near the center of the lmc ( their table  17 ; see also  3.3 ) .",
    "we also discard one rogue carbon star ( c0433@xmath576607 ) for its highly discrepant velocity .",
    "the resulting homogeneous dataset contains 422 carbon stars , representing a significant subset of the data analyzed in kdia .",
    "ongoing observational campaigns to obtain carbon star radial velocities will likely increase the sample size in the coming years ( suntzeff 1998 ) .",
    "the archival dataset we have assembled is sufficient for the purposes of this study .",
    "feast , thackeray & wesselink ( 1961 ) have discussed the apparent rotation induced by the transverse motion of the lmc .",
    "each of our 422 carbon star velocities are corrected for this projected radial velocity gradient as follows .",
    "we adopt the lmc space motion calculated by kroupa & bastian ( 1997 ) , which is derived from an average of the lmc proper motion they measure with _ hipparcos _ data and the lmc proper motion measured by jones , klemola , & lin  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ and jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) measurements of the lmc proper motion agree within their respective error bars .",
    "we note that kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) make their transverse motion correction using the proper motion measurement by jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "it is useful to establish a galactic coordinate system for the vector analysis that follows .",
    "following kroupa & bastian ( 1997 ) , the galactocentric coordinates used here are such that the galactic center and the sun are located at 0 and @xmath58 kpc along the @xmath59-axis , respectively .",
    "the positive @xmath60-axis points toward the north galactic pole , and the positive @xmath61-axis points in the direction of galactic rotation at the position of the sun . in these coordinates ,",
    "the position vectors of the sun and lmc are @xmath62 @xmath63 in units of kpc .",
    "the velocity vector of the lmc is @xmath64 in units of km s@xmath1 ( kroupa & bastian 1997 ) . the galactocentric radial velocity of the lmc is the vector dot product @xmath65 km s@xmath1 , where @xmath66 is a normalized unit vector .",
    "the vector between the sun and lmc is @xmath67 , and the radial velocity component of the lmc seen from the local standard of rest ( accounting for the sun s peculiar velocity and galactic rotation ) at the position of the sun is @xmath68 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the vector @xmath69 points toward the `` center '' of the lmc , which is assumed to be at @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( kroupa & bastian 1997 ) .",
    "the unit vector connecting the sun to any position in the sky in galactocentric coordinates is @xmath72 the transverse motion velocity correction that we seek is the difference between the projected radial velocity toward the lmc center and the projected radial velocity toward each carbon star .",
    "if we define the vector @xmath73 , the apparent rotation induced by the lmc space motion is @xmath74 .",
    "we make our correction by subtracting @xmath75 from the observed carbon star velocities .",
    "small differences between the kroupa & bastian ( 1997 ) model used here for the transverse motion radial velocity correction and assumptions ( i.e. ,  for the lmc center and distance ) in subsequent sections have a negligible effect on our results .",

    "1986 ) and in its final form predicts @xmath172 .",
    "the density profile of the galactic dark halo assumed for machos ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) is also pseudo - isothermal ; thus our analysis of the lmc disk kinematics supports this dark halo profile over the range of interest ( @xmath174 to 50 kpc ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the lmc is embedded in a `` shroud '' of tidal debris ( weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "such debris is unlikely to contribute significantly to the lmc self - lensing optical depth because too little mass is involved , and it is likely to be located close to the disk ( weinberg 2000 ; see  6.2 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth considering the possibility that our sample of true disk carbon stars is contaminated by tidal debris , which might reconcile a constant - thickness disk model with the disk kinematic data . in this case",
    ", tidal debris would also affect our interpretation of the outer - disk velocity dispersions .",
    "the notion of tidal debris surrounding the lmc is somewhat similar to the suggestion by kdia that the lmc harbors a polar ring , also of tidal origin .",
    "( we note that kdia analysed a larger sample of carbon stars , in which they claim the kinematic signature of a polar ring is evident . )",
    "we have thus far presented an interpretation of the radial velocity data for 422 carbon stars in the lmc that does not require a polar ring , or tidal debris .",
    "the nature of tidal debris ( in a polar ring or otherwise ) is investigated as follows .",
    "if we assume that a constant - thickness maximal disk model represents the true lmc disk , the `` excess '' velocity dispersion in each zonal solution may be calculated by subtracting the model contribution from the observed dispersions in quadrature , which yields @xmath175 = 15.0 , 13.7 , 18.8 and 20.5 km s@xmath1 at @xmath9 = 4.0 , 5.6 , 6.4 and 8.2 kpc , respectively .",
    "next , if we assume that the contaminating debris has a uniform velocity dispersion of @xmath750 km  s@xmath1 , the ratio of contaminating stars to total stars in each zonal solution would be of order @xmath710 - 20% .",
    "( this ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion assumed for the tidal debris . ) in each of our zones , we estimate the number of @xmath750 km  s@xmath1 tidal debris stars would be 12 , 17 , 10 , and 8 ( in order of increasing radius ) , if the lmc disk were of constant thickness .",
    "we calculate that our four disk zones subtend relative sky areas of 0.40/0.16/0.16/1.00 , in order of increasing zone radius .",
    "a regression of the relative numbers of tidal debris stars with the relative zone areas shows an anti - correlation , significant at the @xmath71@xmath43 level . assuming that the true disk and tidal debris carbon stars are similarly affected by incompleteness in the data , this is not what we naively expect from the tidal debris scenario described by weinberg ( 2000 ) .",
    "the two outermost zones are illustrative .",
    "they have area ratios that differ by a factor of @xmath76 , yet the estimated numbers of contaminating tidal debris stars are 10 and 8 .",
    "therefore , the contaminating debris must have a non - uniform radial distribution of surface density , velocity dispersion , or both .",
    "it is also possible , but even more contrived , that a spatially - dependent incompleteness in the carbon star dataset has conspired with a non - uniform spatial distribution of tidal debris to yield the observed velocity dispersions . in light of this analysis ,",
    "we prefer an interpretation of the lmc rotation curve and disk velocity dispersions that invokes a negligible contamination from tidal debris ( i.e. , our maximal flared disk model ) .    the unambiguous detection of nonvirialized lmc stars and the accurate characterization of their spatial distribution are clearly desirable .",
    "observations of such a population / structure would be relevant to our interpretation of the lmc rotation curve and disk kinematics , with possible additional implications for lmc microlensing ( e.g.  zhao 1999 ; graff et al .  1999 ; weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "here we calculate the lmc self - lensing optical depth of our maximal flared disk model by directly integrating the spatial density of stars given in equation  ( 37 ) .",

    "our calculation is the case of `` pure '' self - lensing ( gould 1995 ) , which yields an upper limit . the effects of dust obscuration and nonlensing mass in the plane of the disk will lower the real value of the optical depth for a fixed total mass of the lmc .    we have calculated the self - lensing optical depths in each of the 30 survey fields in the 5.7-year lmc microlensing analysis by alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see also gyuk et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the central - most fields ,",
    "we find @xmath191 , while in the fields lying at the largest true radii , we find @xmath192 .",
    "the field - averaged optical depth for lmc disk self - lensing is : @xmath193 .",
    "the lmc inclination dominates the uncertainty in @xmath194 .",
    "first , we note that the inclination is probably not a serious concern for the rotation curve and disk kinematics because the shape of the @xmath89 function ( eqn .",
    "[ 15 ] ) is fairly insensitive to @xmath14 over the range of plausible values .",
    "however , gould  ( 1995 ) and gyuk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that , to first order , @xmath195 is proportional to the square of the mass - weighted velocity dispersion and an inclination factor of sec@xmath196 . therefore , we simply rescale our calculation of @xmath194 for different inclinations , @xmath197 which should be quite accurate for the lmc inclinations typically found . as noted in  2.2 , cole et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find @xmath45 .",
    "thus their @xmath72@xmath43 upper limit , @xmath198 , yields @xmath199 . for comparison ,",
    "bothun & thompson ( 1988 ) find @xmath200 , which corresponds to @xmath201 .",
    "the contribution to the uncertainty in @xmath194 from the velocity dispersion follows from gould s ( 1995 ) formula and our equation  ( 34 ) ; it is of order @xmath202 , or a negligible 0.03% .",
    "finally , the @xmath710% uncertainty in @xmath203 yields a @xmath720% uncertainty on the total lmc mass , but this corresponds to a small uncertainty in the factor of @xmath204 in equation  ( 42 ) .",
    "the self - lensing optical depth on the near and far sides of the minor axis at the distances spanned by the 30 fields in alcock et al .  ( 2000 ) varies by @xmath75% due to the inclination of the disk ( e.g.  gould 1994 ) .",
    "thus the flaring of the lmc disk has only a minor effect on the spatial distribution of the self - lensing optical depth , which is a potential diagnostic of the lens population ( e.g.  alcock et al .",
    "the estimate of a @xmath75% minor axis asymmetry in the optical depth would increase for larger adopted values of the inclination .",
    "gyuk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently reviewed different self - lensing calculations in the literature . to first order ,",
    "self - lensing from the virialized lmc disk is proportional to the following combinations of derivable quantities ( gyuk et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath205 our model accounts for `` second order '' effects , such as the finite radial extent and flare of the lmc disk .",
    "we have shown that uncertainties in the lmc proper motion contribute a @xmath71% uncertainty to @xmath43 and a @xmath720% uncertainty to @xmath25 ( via @xmath203 ) , assuming a truncated and flared maximal disk model . assuming this model , our numerical calculation of the self - lensing optical depth ( eqn .  [ 42 ] ) is appropriate .",
    "the maximal disk model is consistent with lmc dynamics .",
    "however , if a model of the lmc with a dark halo is preferred , the halo will probably contribute to lmc self - lensing in addition to the disk . in this case , our equation  ( 42 ) is not appropriate ( see gyuk et al .",
    "we have adopted a minimal lmc disk , and provided an example maximal dark halo which is consistent with the rotation curve .",
    "measurements of the lmc disk mass to light ratio would better constrain the minimal lmc disk model ( our model is extreme ) . for the more complicated case of an lmc with a dark halo , constraints on",
    "self - lensing are weaker .",
    "this is due partly to the uncertainty that the lmc proper motion contributes to the rotation curve , which constrains the total lmc mass .",
    "the lmc self - lensing optical depth may depend systematically on the age of the stars whose kinematics are studied .",
    "historically , it has been difficult to prove that old lmc stellar populations have different velocity dispersions .",
    "for example , the ch stars in the lmc were originally thought to trace the elusive lmc halo population , by analogy with ch stars in the galaxy ( hartwick & cowley 1988 , cowley & hartwick 1991 ) .",
    "however , the ch stars in the lmc are now believed to represent a much younger population ( suntzeff et al .",
    "we note that our average carbon star velocity dispersion ( 18.9 km s@xmath1 ) is similar to that found for the ch stars ( 20 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "according to aubourg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and salati et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the lmc could harbor an old population with a large velocity dispersion .",
    "these authors invoke wielen s ( 1977 ) age - velocity dispersion calibration from the solar neighborhood .",
    "we note that weilen s calibration was derived for stars younger than @xmath73 gyr , and extrapolation beyond this age may not be appropriate .",
    "moreover , weinberg ( 2000 ) predicts that the velocity dispersions in the lmc disk , under the influence of the galactic tidal field , will remain constant ( or decrease ) over time .",
    "extant observational studies have not yielded a clear picture of the variation of velocity dispersion with age in the lmc .",
    "for example , the old globular clusters in the lmc , with ages of @xmath712 gyrs ( olsen et al .",
    "1998 ) , exhibit a velocity dispersion of @xmath721 - 24 km s@xmath1 ( schommer et al .",
    "1992 ; see also freeman , illingworth , & oemler 1982 ) .",
    "thus , the lmc carbon stars and ancient clusters support the hypothesis of a constant disk velocity dispersion ( for stellar populations older than @xmath73 gyr ) , in agreement with weinberg s ( 2000 ) prediction .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of old lpvs in the lmc , with ages of @xmath78 gyr ( hughes , wood , & reid 1991 ; olszweski , sunzteff , & mateo 1996 ) , is @xmath735 km s@xmath1 ( hughes et al .",
    "further observational studies are needed , particularly given the provocative old lpv result .",
    "last , we suggest that a shroud of tidal debris or a polar ring , if they exist , would probably make a negligible contribution to the lmc self - lensing optical depth because the total amount of mass involved is small .",
    "weinberg ( 2000 ) reached a similar conclusion .",
    "the rotation of the disk of the lmc has been derived from the radial velocities of 422 carbon stars ( kunkel , irwin , & demers 1997 ) .",
    "we have propogated the uncertainty in the lmc space motion to the lmc rotation curve with a monte carlo calculation .",
    "the associated disk velocity dispersions found in each rotating disk zonal solution are less sensitive to systematic uncertainties from the lmc space motion than the circular velocities obtained .",
    "we note that our carbon star rotation curve is derived in a manner consistent with the rotation curve analysis by kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; thus our respective results are properly comparable .",
    "we have fit our carbon star rotation curve and the rotation curve with a truncated , maximal lmc disk model , yielding a total lmc mass of @xmath143  @xmath3  @xmath140 .",
    "we also conclude that the disk of the lmc is flared . extrapolating the flare inferred at small radii ( where tidal perturbations are small ) to the outer - disk , and accounting for the influence of the galactic dark halo , we are able to approximately reproduce the observed disk kinematics .",
    "this model favors an isothermal density profile for the galactic dark halo out to a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "our truncated and flared maximal disk model yields a limit on the spatially - averaged lmc self - lensing optical depth of @xmath206 .",
    "for plausible values of the lmc inclination , this low self - lensing rate compared to the measured microlensing rate allows for the existence of a dark lens population in the galactic halo ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "finally , we caution that we have not included in our analysis ( 1 ) the dynamical effects of an lmc bar , ( 2 ) large - scale non - circular motions , ( 3 ) non - uniform anisotropy of the disk velocity dispersions , or ( 4 ) arbitrary spatial distributions of tidal debris ( i.e. , a polar ring or stars out of virial equilibrium ) . despite these shortcomings , our truncated and flared maximal disk model successfully accounts for the general dynamical characteristics of the lmc , lending inferences from the model high weight .",
