    "<S> the presence of a period - doubling cascade in dynamical systems that depend on a parameter is one of the basic routes to chaos . </S>",
    "<S> it is rarely mentioned that there are virtually always infinitely many cascades whenever there is one . </S>",
    "<S> we report that for one- and two - dimensional phase space , in the transition from no chaos to chaos  as a parameter is varied  there must be infinitely many cascades under some mild hypotheses . </S>",
    "<S> our meaning of chaos includes the case of chaotic sets which are not attractors . </S>",
    "<S> numerical studies indicate that this result applies to the forced - damped pendulum and the forced duffing equations , viewing the solutions once each period of the forcing . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that in many cases cascades appear in pairs connected ( in joint parameter - state space ) by an unstable periodic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> paired cascades can be destroyed or created by perturbations , whereas unpaired cascades are conserved under even significant perturbations .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quadratic ] as @xmath0 increases towards a value @xmath1 , one encounters a family of periodic orbits that undergo an infinite sequence of period doublings with the period of these orbits tending to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of infinitely - many such ( period - doubling ) cascades is one of the most prominent features observed in the study of parametrized maps . </S>",
    "<S> cascades were first reported by myrberg in 1962  @xcite ( _ cf . _ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> there are infinitely - many cascades , each with infinitely - many period - doubling bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> each saddle - node bifurcation creates both a cascade and a path of unstable orbits , the latter shown as black curves for periods up to six . </S>",
    "<S> we call the paths of unstable orbits the * stems * of the cascades . </S>",
    "<S> below the largest gaps or _ windows _ in the blue regions , we give the period of the associated cascade . </S>",

    "<S> we find that for many systems depending on a parameter , every periodic orbit is part of a cascade ; for such systems , cascades are as fundamental as periodic orbits themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling properties of individual cascades have been studied for cascades in nearly quadratic maps  @xcite , but there are only a few results about the existence of cascades  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a * bifurcation orbit * is any orbit having an eigenvalue with absolute value @xmath15 .    </S>",

    "<S> cascades @xmath28 and @xmath29 constitute a * pair * of cascades , since they are connected by a family of orbits ( black curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> cascade @xmath30 is unbounded and unpaired , as indicated by the black curve continuing to the right to @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bounded ] ]    * assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> * _ all results in this paper assume that the maps @xmath32 are infinitely differentiable jointly in the parameter @xmath0 and in phase space @xmath33 and that all of the periodic orbit bifurcations are * generic * , meaning that every bifurcation orbit is a standard nondegenerate period - doubling , saddle - node , or hopf bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> _ for example , generic maps have neither symmetries nor symmetry breaking bifurcations . nor </S>",
    "<S> do they have pitchfork or period - tripling bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that for any parameter interval @xmath34 $ ] , all periodic orbits are contained in a bounded set in phase space .    * the cascades route to chaos in dimensions one and two . * </S>",
    "<S> usually the term `` route to chaos '' refers to formation of _ chaotic attractors _ , in which case there are several possible routes to chaos . in this letter , we consider routes from a parameter having no chaos to one with _ chaotic sets _ , where the sets are not necessarily attractors . in fact , we require only one aspect of chaos : we say that there is * chaos * at a particular @xmath0 if there are infinitely many regular periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there is chaos whenever there is a transverse homoclinic point . </S>",
    "<S> that is equivalent to having a horseshoe for some iterate of the map , and it implies there are infinitely many regular saddles in two dimensions , and infinitely many regular unstable orbits in dimension one . </S>",
    "<S> this definition of chaos is sufficiently general as to include having one or multiple coexisting chaotic attractors , as well as the case of transient chaos . </S>",
    "<S> we say a map has * no chaos * at a particular @xmath0 if there are at most finitely many regular periodic orbits .    </S>",
    "<S> * cascades route to chaos theorem . * </S>",
    "<S> _ assume the parametrized map @xmath35 has a one- or two - dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> if at parameter value @xmath36 there is no chaos , and at @xmath37 , there is chaos and there are at most finitely many attracting orbits ( and finitely many repelling orbits in dimension 2 ) , then @xmath38 has infinitely many cascades between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . _    </S>",
    "<S> thus for one- and two- dimensional smooth families , the only route to chaos is through infinitely many cascades . </S>",
    "<S> it is for instance impossible to get chaos at @xmath37 from a single cascade .    if we were to omit the assumption that there are infinitely many _ </S>",
    "<S> regular _ orbits , the conclusion would be false . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the quadratic map let @xmath39 denote the feigenbaum parameter value , i.e. , the first parameter value where the period doublings accumulate . at @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> there are infinitely many periodic orbits , and all but one are flip orbits . furthermore @xmath39 is preceded by a single cascade .    </S>",
    "<S> each cascade will have some minimum period @xmath8 and will have periodic orbits of periods @xmath40 . if the map is one - dimensional or is two - dimensional and dissipative in the sense that there are no repelling periodic orbits , then each of these periods is the period of some attracting orbits in the path , though not all orbits will necessarily be attracting .    </S>",
    "<S> based on numerical studies , a number of maps appear to satisfy the conditions of the cascades route to chaos theorem . </S>",
    "<S> note that these numerical verifications involve significantly more work than just plotting the attracting sets for each parameter , since we are concerned about both the stable and the unstable behavior to determine whether there is chaos . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the time-@xmath41 maps for the double - well duffing ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vdp ] ) , the triple - well duffing , and forced - damped pendulum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pend ] ) , as well as the ikeda map used to describe the field of a laser cavity , and the pulsed damped rotor map .     were plotted in red for the time-@xmath41 map of the forced - damped pendulum equation : @xmath42 , indicating the general areas with chaotic dynamics for this map . </S>",
    "<S> then the attracting sets were plotted in black , hiding some periodic points . </S>",
    "<S> much more detailed calculations confirm that interspersed with the chaos , there are some parameter ranges without chaos . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pend ] ]    we now discuss the creation of a path @xmath43)$ ] of _ regular orbits_. consider the procedure of starting at a regular periodic orbit and following the path of periodic orbits containing it in @xmath44-space , following only regular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> follow the path  such as numerically  through saddle - node bifurcations by reversing the direction in the parameter space . when period-@xmath8 orbits reach a period - doubling bifurcation @xmath45)$ ] , </S>",
    "<S> follow the period-@xmath46 orbits . </S>",
    "<S> they are regular orbits , whereas the extension past @xmath45)$ ] of period-@xmath8 orbits are flip orbits . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , at a period - halving bifurcation , follow along the branch of regular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> following a path away from a cascade can lead to @xmath47 or it can lead to a second cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we call an entire connected path of regular orbits a * component*. two orbits are in the same component if and only if it is possible to follow a path of regular orbits from one orbit to the other continuously , without jumps , though the period is allowed to double many times .    * there are two types of cascades . </S>",
    "<S> * only one type of cascades occurs for quadratic maps , but there is a second type of cascade as well . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the component of a cascade either lies in a bounded region of @xmath44-space , or it does not . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly we call the cascade * bounded * or * unbounded * , respectively , though the adjective really describes the cascade s component . each cascade in the quadratic map ( _ cf . _ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quadratic ] ) is unbounded because a branch of periodic orbits extends from each cascade to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant period branch that extends to infinity is called the * stem * of the ( unbounded ) cascade . thus the theory of quadratic maps </S>",
    "<S> is the theory of unbounded cascades . </S>",
    "<S> we call the period of the orbits in the stem , the * stem period of the unbounded cascade*. ( we only treat the case of an unbounded cascade which has a constant period stem . )    </S>",
    "<S> we refer to two cascades as a * pair * if they are in the same component ; that is , if the two cascades have a path of periodic orbits running from one the other ( _ cf . _ </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bounded ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown the following rigorous result .    </S>",
    "<S> * bounded paired cascades theorem . * _ bounded cascades always come in pairs . </S>",
    "<S> _    the theorem below shows that paired cascades are common . </S>",
    "<S> once again we consider @xmath49 in a one- or two - dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we say that map @xmath38 has * off - on - off chaos * for @xmath50 if there is no chaos at @xmath36 and @xmath51 , whereas at @xmath37 , @xmath38 is as assumed in the cascades route to chaos theorem </S>",
    "<S> .    * off - on - off chaos theorem . * _ if @xmath38 is two - dimensional and has off - on - off chaos for @xmath50 , then @xmath38 has infinitely many bounded paired cascades and at most finitely many unbounded cascades . </S>",
    "<S> _    our numerical studies indicate that the time-@xmath41 maps of the forced double - well duffing ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vdp ] ) and forced damped pendulum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pend ] ) have off - on - off chaos , and that it occurs on multiple non - overlapping parameter regions . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 is the forcing period . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we can not prove there are only finitely many periodic attractors , though we find very few . </S>",
    "<S> these systems have no periodic repellers .    </S>",
    "<S> * conservation of unbounded cascades . * </S>",
    "<S> if in addition to the hypotheses of the cascades route to chaos theorem , we assume further that ( _ i _ ) at @xmath36 there are no regular periodic orbits and ( _ ii _ ) at @xmath37 there are no attractors ( nor repellers in dimension two ) , then the component of _ each _ regular orbit at @xmath37 contains a cascade that is between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and distinct regular orbits at @xmath37 are in different components . starting at each regular orbit at @xmath37 , there is a unique path of regular orbits  initially in the direction of @xmath36  ending in a cascade . </S>",
    "<S> thus the number of cascades hitting the boundary of the parameter interval depends only on the number of regular orbits at @xmath37 , independent of the behavior of the map between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a heuristic * conservation principle for unbounded cascades * : if @xmath52 satisfies property ( _ i _ ) for @xmath0 sufficiently negative and property ( _ ii _ ) for @xmath0 sufficiently positive , then any perturbation @xmath53 such that @xmath38 dominates @xmath54 for @xmath47 has the same set of unbounded cascades .    </S>",
    "<S> three rigorous examples of this idea are encapsulated in the following one - dimensional maps @xmath55 where for some real positive @xmath56 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eqn : g1 }      for such @xmath54 , each of the three maps each has no regular periodic orbits for @xmath0 sufficiently negative , and for @xmath0 sufficiently large has a one - dimensional horseshoe map . </S>",
    "<S> the quartic map was chosen so that when @xmath54 is identically 0 and @xmath58 , the graph has two minima , at @xmath59 , and the local maximum is at @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions on @xmath54 guarantee that it does not significantly affect the periodic orbits when @xmath61 is sufficiently large ; in particular it does not affect their eigenvalues , so it does not affect the number of period-@xmath8 regular periodic orbits for large @xmath61 . hence one can check that all three maps have no regular periodic orbits for @xmath0 very negative and have no attracting periodic orbits for @xmath0 very positive , and for sufficiently large @xmath61 , all periodic orbits are contained in the set @xmath62 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus the following holds .    </S>",
    "<S> * conservation of cascades theorem . * _ for any @xmath38 of the functions in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : quad+g ] , with @xmath54 chosen as in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : g1 ] , the number of stem - period-@xmath4 unbounded cascades is independent of the choice of g. _    [ table1 ]    . the number of unbounded cascades of stem period @xmath4 for any large - scale perturbation of the quadratic , cubic , and quartic maps , respectively labeled @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .

    "<S> cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the number of unbounded cascades in each of these three cases is summarized in our table . </S>",
    "<S> the relative sizes reflect the complexity of the three horseshoe maps ; the quadratic map has the complexity of a standard two - branch horseshoe , whereas the cubic has a horseshoe with three branches , and the quartic has four branches .    </S>",
    "<S> the conservation principle works for two- and higher - dimensional maps as well . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown in  @xcite that large - scale perturbations of the two - dimensional hnon map conserve unbounded cascades . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that there is conservation of unbounded cascades for a coupled system of @xmath66 quadratic maps . </S>"
