    "multilayer networks  @xcite are emerging as a powerful paradigm for describing complex systems characterized by the coexistence of different types of interactions .",
    "multilayer networks represent an appropriate descriptive model for real networked systems in disparate contexts , such as social @xcite , technological @xcite and biological systems @xcite .",
    "for example , global infrastructures are formed by several interdependent networks , such as power grids , water supply networks , and communication systems , and studying their properties require to account for the presence of such interdependencies  @xcite .",
    "cell function and/or malfunction ( yielding diseases ) can not be understood if the information on the different nature of the interactions forming the interactome ( protein - protein interactions , signaling , regulation ) are not integrated in a general multilayer scenario  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the complexity of the brain is encoded in the different nature of the interactions existing at the functional and the structural levels  @xcite .    a multilayer networks",
    "is composed of a set of networks forming its layers  @xcite .",
    "nodes can be connected within and across layers .",
    "it has been shown that multilayer networks are much more fragile than isolated networks just because of the presence of interdependencies among the layers of the system  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fragility of the system increases as the number of layers increases  @xcite .",
    "such a feature has an intuitive explanation . in the standard percolation model for multilayer networks ,",
    "the probability that a node is damaged equals to the probability that at least one of its interdependent nodes is damaged . as the number of layers increases , the probability of individual failures grows thus making the system more fragile .",
    "this scenario leads , however , to the conundrum : if the fragility of a system is increased by the number of layers of interactions , why are there so many real systems that display multiple layers of interactions ?",
    "further , the addition of new layers of interactions in a preexisting multilayer network has generally a cost , so it does nt seem reasonable to spend resources just to make the system less robust .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to provide a potential explanation by introducing a new model for percolation in networks composed of multiple interacting layers . in the model",
    ", we will assume that a node is damaged only if all its interdependent nodes are simultaneously damaged .",
    "the model is perfectly equivalent to the standard one when the number of layer equals two .",
    "additional layers , however , provide the system with redundant interdependencies , generating backup mechanisms against the failure of the system , and thus making it more robust .",
    "the robustness of multilayer networks in presence of redundant interdependencies is here investigated using a message - passing theory @xcite ( also known as the cavity method ) .",
    "we build on recent advances obtained in standard interdependent percolation theory @xcite to propose a theory that is valid for multilayer networks with link overlap @xcite as long as the multilayer network is locally tree - like .",
    "this limitation is common to all message - passing approaches for studying critical phenomena on networks .",
    "corrections have been recently proposed @xcite on single networks to improve the performace of message - passing theory and similar approximations valid for loopy multilayer networks might be envisaged in the future .",
    "we consider a multilayer network @xmath0 composed of @xmath1 layers @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "every layer contains @xmath4 nodes .",
    "exactly one node with the same label appears in every individual layer .",
    "nodes in the various layers sharing a common label are called _ replica nodes _ , and they are considered as interdependent on each other  @xcite .",
    "nodes in the network are identified by a pair of labels @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath3 , the first one indicating the index of the node , and the second one standing for the index of the layer . for every node label @xmath7",
    ", the set of replica nodes is given by the @xmath1 nodes corresponding to pairs of labels @xmath8 with with @xmath3 ( see figure  [ fig : multiplex2 ] ) .",
    "when at least two replica nodes @xmath5 and @xmath9 are connected to two corresponding replica nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 we say that the multilayer network displays link overlap .    given a multilayer network as described above , we consider a percolation model where some of the nodes are initially damaged .",
    "we assume that the interdependencies are redundant , i.e. , every node can be active only if at least one its interdependent nodes is also active .",
    "we refer to this model as `` redundant percolation model . '' as an order parameter for the model , we define the so - called redundant mutually connected giant component ( rmcgc ) .",
    "the nodes that belong to the rmcgc can be found by following the algorithm :    * the giant component of each layer @xmath12 is determined , evaluating the effect of the damaged nodes in each single layer ; * _ every replica node that has no other replica node in the giant component of its proper layer is removed from the network and considered as damaged _ ; * if no new damaged nodes are found at step ( ii ) , then the algorithm stops , otherwise it proceeds , starting again from step  ( i ) .",
    "the set of replica nodes that are not damaged when the algorithm stops belongs to the rmcgc .",
    "the main difference with the standard percolation model @xcite on multilayer networks and the consequent definition of mutually connected giant component ( mcgc ) is that step ( ii ) must be substituted with `` every replica node that has at least a single replica node not in the giant component of its proper layer is removed from the network and considered as damaged , i.e. , if a replica node is damaged all its interdependent replica nodes are damaged ''  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rmcgc and the mcgc are the same for @xmath13 layers , but they differ as long as the number of layers @xmath14 . in the latter case ,",
    "the rmcgc naturally introduces the notion of redundancy among interdependent nodes .",
    "as we will see in the following , the main effect of redundancy is to let the robustness of the system increases as the number of layers increases .",
