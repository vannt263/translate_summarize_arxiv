    "in the last few years a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of interacting quantum fields out of equilibrium .",
    "there are , in fact , many interesting physical situations in which the standard s",
    " matrix approach can not give sensible information about the behavior of the system , because it evolves through a series of highly excited states ( i.e. , states of finite energy density ) .",
    "as an example consider any model of cosmological inflation : it is not possible to extract precise predictions on physical observables without including in the treatment the quantum back  reaction of the field on the space  time geometry and on itself @xcite .    on the side of particle physics ,",
    "the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , scheduled in the forthcoming years at cern  sps , bnl  rhic and cern  lhc , are supposed to produce hadron matter at very high densities and temperatures ; in such a regime the usual approach based on particle scattering can not be considered a good interpretative tool at all . to extract sensible information from the theory new computational schemes are necessary , that go beyond the simple feynman diagram expansion .",
    "the use of resummation schemes , like the hartree  fock ( hf ) @xcite approximation and the large @xmath1 limit ( ln ) @xcite , or the hard thermal loop resummation for systems at finite temperature ( htl ) @xcite , can be considered a first step in this direction .",
    "they , in fact , enforce a sum over an infinite subset of feynman diagrams that are dominant in a given region of the parameter space , where the simple truncation of the usual perturbative series at finite order can not give sensible answers .",
    "quite recently hf and ln have been used in order to clarify some dynamical aspects of the large @xmath1 @xmath2 theory .",
    "for the reader s benefit and to better motivate this work , we give a very short summary of the conclusions reached in previous works : i ) the early time evolution is dominated by a so  called `` linear regime '' , during which the energy initially stored in one ( or few ) modes of the field is transferred to other modes via either parametric or spinodal unstabilities , resulting in a large particle production and a consequent dissipation for the initial condensate @xcite ; ii ) the linear regime stops at a time scale @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the quartic coupling constant ) , by which the effects of the quantum fluctuation become of the same order as the classical contribution and the dynamics turns completely non linear and non perturbative @xcite ; iii ) after the time @xmath5 the relaxation occurs via power laws with anomalous dynamical exponent @xcite ; iv ) the asymptotic particle distribution , obtained as the result of the copious particle production at the expenses of the `` classical '' energy , is strongly non - thermal @xcite ; and finally , v ) at very large time scale , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 stands for the volume of the system ) , the non  perturbative and non  linear evolution might eventually produce the onset of a novel form of non  equilibrium bose  einstein condensation of the long  wavelength goldstone bosons usually present in the broken symmetry phase of the model @xcite .",
    "another very interesting result in @xcite concerns the dynamical maxwell construction , which reproduces the flat region of the effective potential in case of broken symmetry as asymptotic fixed points of the background evolution .",
    "moreover , the ln approximation scheme has been used to follow the evolution of a initial state characterized by an occupied spherical shell in momentum space ( a spherical tsunami @xcite ) , around a particular momentum @xmath8 , with the following results : i ) in a theory where the symmetry is spontaneously broken at zero density , if we start with a finite density initial state with restored symmetry , the spinodal instabilities lead to a dynamical symmetry breaking ; ii ) the evolution produces a re - arrangement of the particle distribution towards low momenta , signalling the onset of bose condensation ; iii ) the equation of state of the asymptotic gas is ultra - relativistic ( even if the distribution is not thermal ) @xcite .    in this article we present a detailed study , _ in finite volume _ , of dynamical evolution out of equilibrium for the @xmath9 scalar field in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "more precisely , we determine how such dynamics scales with the size of the periodic box containing the system in the case of uniform backgrounds .",
    "this is necessary to address questions like out  of  equilibrium symmetry breaking and dynamical bose ",
    "einstein condensation .    in section [ cft ]",
    "we define the model in finite volume , giving all the relevant notations and definitions .",
    "we also stress the convexity of the effective potential as an exact result , valid for the full renormalized theory in any volume .    in section [ ln ]",
    "we derive the large @xmath1 approximation of the @xmath10invariant version of @xmath11 model , according to the general rules of ref . @xcite . in this derivation",
    "it appears evident the essential property of the @xmath12 limit of being a particular type of _ classical _ limit , so that it leads to a classical phase space , a classical hamiltonian with associated hamilton s equations of motion [ see eqs .",
    "( [ sk2 ] ) , ( [ nunbgap ] ) and ( [ nbgap ] ) ] .",
    "we then minimize the hamiltonian function(al ) and determine the conditions for massless goldstone bosons ( i.e. transverse fluctuations of the field ) to form a bose ",
    "einstein condensate , delocalizing the vacuum field expectation value ( see also ref .",
    "this necessarily requires that the width of the zero  mode fluctuations becomes macroscopically large , that is of the order of the volume .",
    "only when the background takes one of the extremal values proper of symmetry breaking the width of the zero  mode fluctuations is of order @xmath13 , as typical of a free massless spectrum .",
    "the study of the lowest energy states of the model is needed for comparison with the results of the numerical simulations , which show that the zero  mode width @xmath14 stays microscopic ( that is such that @xmath15volume@xmath16 when the volume diverges ) whenever it starts from initial conditions in which it is microscopic .",
    "our results , in fact , show clearly the presence of a time scale @xmath17 , proportional to the linear size @xmath18 of the system , at which finite volume effects start to manifest",
    ". we shall give a very simple physical interpretation of this time scale in section [ numerical ] .",
    "the important point is that after @xmath17 the zero mode amplitude starts decreasing , then enters an erratic evolution , but never grows macroscopically large .",
    "this result is at odd with the interpretation of the linear late ",
    "time growth of the zero  mode width as a full dynamical bose ",
    "einstein condensation of goldstone bosons , but is compatible with the `` novel '' form of bec reported in @xcite .",
    "in fact we do find that the size of the low  lying widths at time @xmath17 is of order @xmath18 , to be compared to the equilibrium situation where they would be of order @xmath19 in the massive case or of order @xmath13 in the massless case .",
    "perhaps the denomination `` microscopic '' should be reserved to this two possibilities . therefore , since our initial condition are indeed microscopic in this restricted sense , we do observe in the out  of  equilibrium evolution a rapid transition to a different regime intermediate between the microscopic one and the macroscopic one characteristic of bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "as we shall discuss more in detail later on , this fully agrees with the result found in @xcite , that the time ",
    "dependent field correlations vanish at large separations more slowly than for equilibrium free massless fields ( as @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 ) , but definitely faster than the equilibrium broken symmetry phase characterized by constant correlations at large distances .    at any rate ,",
    "when one considers microscopic initial conditions for the choice of bare mass which corresponds to broken symmetry , the role itself of symmetry breaking is not very clear in the large @xmath1 description of the out  of  equilibrium dynamics , making equally obscure the issues concerning the so  called quantum phase ordering @xcite .",
    "this is because the limit @xmath12 is completely saturated by gaussian states , which might signal the onset of symmetry breaking only developing macroscopically large fluctuations . since such fluctuations do not appear to be there , the meaning itself of symmetry breaking , as something happening as times goes on and accompanied by some kind of phase ordering , is quite unclear .",
    "we postpone to a companion work @xcite the discussion about the possibility of using more comprehensive approximation schemes , that include some non  gaussian features of the complete theory . as far as the large @xmath1 approximation is concerned , we underline that an important limitation of our approach , as well as of those of the references mentioned above , is in any case the assumption of a uniform background . nonetheless , phenomena like the asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass and the dynamical maxwell construction , taking place in this contest of a uniform background and large @xmath1 expansion , are certainly very significant manifestations of symmetry breaking and in particular of the goldstone theorem which applies when a continuous symmetry is broken .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we summarize the results presented in this article and we sketch some interesting open problems that we plan to study in forthcoming works .",
    "we consider the @xmath22component scalar field operator @xmath23 in a @xmath24dimensional periodic box of size @xmath18 and write its fourier expansion as customary @xmath25 with the wavevectors @xmath26 naturally quantized : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the canonically conjugated momentum @xmath29 has a similar expansion @xmath30 with the commutation rules @xmath31= i\\,\\delta^{(d)}_{kk'}\\,\\delta^{\\a\\b}$ ] .",
    "the introduction of a finite volume should be regarded as a regularization of the infrared properties of the model , which allows to `` count '' the different field modes and is needed especially in the case of broken symmetry .",
    "in fact , all the results we have summarized in section [ int ] , have been obtained simulating the system directly in infinite volume , where the evolution equations contain momentum integrals , that must be computed numerically by a proper , but nonetheless rather arbitrary , discretization in momentum space .",
    "of course , the final result should be as insensitive as possible to the particular choice of the integration grid .",
    "in such a situation , the definition of a `` zero '' mode and the interpretation of its late time behavior might not be rigorous enough , unless , for some reason , it turns out that a particular mode requires a different treatment compared to the others . in order to understand this point ,",
    "it is necessary to put the system in a finite volume ( a box of size @xmath7 ) ; the periodic boundary conditions let us single out the zero mode in a rigorous way and thus we can carefully analyze its scaling properties with @xmath7 and get some information on the infinite volume limit .    to regularize also the ultraviolet behavior ,",
    "we restrict the sums over wavevectors to the points lying within the @xmath24dimensional sphere of radius @xmath32 , that is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 some large integer .",
    "clearly we have reduced the original field  theoretical problem to a quantum  mechanical framework with finitely many ( of order @xmath35 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath2 hamiltonian reads @xmath36 =    \\frac12\\sum_k\\left[\\bds\\pi_k \\!\\cdot \\bds\\pi_{-k } + ( k^2 +    \\mbare)\\,\\bds\\phi_k \\!\\cdot \\bds\\phi_{-k}\\right ] + \\\\    & + \\dfrac\\lbare{4l^d } \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4 } ( \\bds\\phi_{k_1}\\!\\!\\cdot    \\bds\\phi_{k_2})(\\bds\\phi_{k_3 } \\!\\!\\cdot \\bds\\phi_{k_4 } )    \\,\\delta^{(d)}_{k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4,0 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 should depend on the uv cutoff @xmath32 in such a way to guarantee a finite limit @xmath39 for all observable quantities . as is known , this implies triviality ( that is vanishing of renormalized vertex functions with more than two external lines ) for @xmath40 and very likely also for @xmath41 . in the latter case triviality is manifest in the one  loop approximation and in large@xmath42 limit due to the landau pole .",
    "for this reason we shall keep @xmath32 finite and regard the @xmath2 model as an effective low  energy theory ( here low  energy means practically all energies below planck s scale , due to the large value of the landau pole for renormalized coupling constants of order one or less ) .",
    "we shall work in the wavefunction representation where @xmath43 and @xmath44 while for @xmath45 ( in lexicographic sense ) @xmath46 notice that by construction the variables @xmath47 are all real .",
    "of course , when either one of the cutoffs are removed , the wave function @xmath48 acquires infinitely many arguments and becomes what is usually called a _",
    "wavefunctional_.    in practice , the problem of studying the dynamics of the @xmath2 field out of equilibrium consists now in trying to solve the time - dependent schroedinger equation given an initial wavefunction @xmath49 that describes a state of the field far away from the vacuum .",
    "by this we mean a non  stationary state that , in the infinite volume limit @xmath50 , would lay outside the particle fock space constructed upon the vacuum .",
    "this approach could be generalized in a straightforward way to mixtures described by density matrices , as done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "here we shall restrict to pure states , for sake of simplicity and because all relevant aspects of the problem are already present in this case .",
    "it is by now well known @xcite that perturbation theory is not suitable for the purpose stated above . due to parametric resonances and/or spinodal instabilities",
    "there are modes of the field that grow exponentially in time until they produce non  perturbative effects for any coupling constant , no matter how small . on the other hand ,",
    "only few , by now standard , approximate non  perturbative schemes are available for the @xmath2 theory , and to these we have to resort after all .",
    "we shall consider here only the large @xmath1 expansion to leading order , remanding to another work the definition of a time - dependent hartree ",
    "fock ( tdhf ) approach @xcite ( a generalization of the treatment given , for instance , in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact these two methods are very closely related , as shown in @xcite , where several techniques to derive reasonable dynamical evolution equations for non ",
    "equilibrium @xmath2 are compared .",
    "we close this section by stressing that the introduction of both a uv and ir cutoff allows to easily derive the well  known rigorous result concerning the flatness of the effective potential .",
    "in fact @xmath51 is a convex analytic function in a finite neighborhood of @xmath52 , as long as the cutoffs are present , due to the uniqueness of the ground state . in the infrared limit @xmath50",
    ", however , @xmath51 might flatten around @xmath52 .",
    "of course this possibility would apply in case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , that is for a double  well classical potential .",
    "this is a subtle and important point that will play a crucial role later on , even if the effective potential is relevant for the static properties of the model rather than the dynamical evolution out of equilibrium that interests us here .",
    "in fact , the dynamical evolution in qft is governed by the ctp effective action @xcite and one might expect that , although non  local in time , it asymptotically reduces to a multiple of the effective potential for trajectories of @xmath53 with a fixed point at infinite time . in such case there should exist a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between fixed points and minima of the effective potential .",
    "in this section we consider the standard non  perturbative approach to the @xmath2 model which is applicable also out of equilibrium , namely the large @xmath1 method as presented in @xcite .",
    "however we shall follow a different derivation which makes the gaussian nature of the @xmath12 limit more explicit .",
    "it is known that the theory described by the hamiltonian ( [ ln_ham ] ) is well behaved for large @xmath1 , provided that the quartic coupling constant @xmath38 is rescaled with @xmath54 .",
    "for example , it is possible to define a perturbation theory , based on the small expansion parameter @xmath54 , in the framework of which one can compute any quantity at any chosen order in @xmath54 . from the diagrammatic point of view , this procedure corresponds to a resummation of the usual perturbative series that automatically collects all the graphs of a given order in @xmath54 together @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been established since the early 80 s that the leading order approximation ( that is the strict limit @xmath12 ) is actually a classical limit @xcite , in the sense that there exists a classical system ( i.e. , a classical phase space , a poisson bracket and a classical hamiltonian ) whose dynamics controls the evolution of all fundamental quantum observables , such as field correlation functions , in the @xmath12 limit . for instance , from the absolute minimum of the classical hamiltonian one reads the energy of the ground state , while the spectrum is given by the frequencies of small oscillations about this minimum , etc .",
    "etc .. we are here interested in finding an efficient and rapid way to compute the quantum evolution equations for some observables in the @xmath55 limit , and we will see that this task is easily accomplished just by deriving the canonical hamilton equations from the large @xmath1 classical hamiltonian .    following yaffe @xcite , we write the quantum mechanical hamiltonian as @xmath56 in terms of the square matrices @xmath57 , @xmath58 with operator entries ( * @xmath59 * is the canonical momentum conjugated to the real mode * @xmath47 * ) @xmath60 these are example of `` classical '' operators , whose two - point correlation functions factorize in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "this can be shown by considering the coherent states @xmath61 \\label{coh_states}\\ ] ] where the complex symmetric matrix @xmath62 has a positive definite real part while @xmath63 and @xmath64 are real and coincide , respectively , with the coherent state expectation values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "as these parameters take all their possible values , the coherent states form an overcomplete set in the cutoff hilbert space of the model . the crucial property which ensures factorization",
    "is that they become all orthogonal in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "moreover one can show @xcite that the coherent states parameters form a classical phase space with poisson brackets @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 reparametrize @xmath62 as @xmath70 .",
    "it is understood that the dimensionality of the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath63 is arbitrary but finite [ that is , only a finite number , say @xmath71 , of pairs @xmath72 may take a nonvanishing expectation value as @xmath12 ] .    once applied to the classical operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 the large @xmath1 factorization allow to obtain the classical hamiltonian by simply replacing @xmath57 and @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ hac ] ) by the coherent expectation values @xmath76 in our situation , having assumed a uniform background expectation value for @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 for all @xmath79 ; moreover , translation invariance implies that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are diagonal matrices , so that we may set @xmath80 in term of the canonical couples @xmath81 which satisfy @xmath82 .",
    "notice that the @xmath83 are just the widths ( rescaled by @xmath84 ) of the @xmath85 symmetric and translation invariant gaussian coherent states .",
    "thus we find the classical hamiltonian @xmath86 + \\frac\\lbare{4l^d } \\left(\\bds q_0 ^ 2+\\sum_k\\s_k^2\\right)^2\\ ] ] where by hamilton s equations of motion @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding conserved energy density @xmath89 may be written @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath7 is the @xmath10invariant quartic potential regarded as a function of @xmath92 , that is @xmath93 .",
    "it is worth noticing that eq .",
    "( [ elargen ] ) would apply as is to generic @xmath94 .",
    "let us consider first the static aspects embodied in the effective potential @xmath95 , that is the minimum of the potential energy @xmath96 at fixed @xmath97 .",
    "we first define in a precise way the unbroken symmetry phase , in this large @xmath1 context , as the case when @xmath95 has a unique minimum at @xmath98 in the limit of infinite volume . minimizing @xmath96 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath83 yields @xmath99 that is the widths characteristic of a free theory with self  consistent mass @xmath100 fixed by the gap equation . by the assumption of unbroken symmetry , when @xmath98 and at infinite volume @xmath100 coincides with the equilibrium mass @xmath101 of the theory , that may be regarded as independent scale parameter .",
    "since in the limit @xmath50 sums are replaced by integrals @xmath102 we obtain the standard bare mass parameterization @xmath103 and the renormalized gap equation @xmath104_{\\text{finite}}\\ ] ] which implies , when @xmath41 , @xmath105 with a suitable choice of the finite part .",
    "no coupling constant renormalization occurs instead when @xmath106 .",
    "the renormalized gap equation ( [ rengapn ] ) may also be written quite concisely @xmath107 in terms of the one ",
    "loop running couplings constant @xmath108^{-1 } \\;,\\quad \\hat\\l(m)=\\l      \\;,\\quad \\hat\\l(2\\lambda\\,e^{-1/2 } ) = \\lbare\\ ] ] it is the landau pole in @xmath109 that actually forbids the limit @xmath39 .",
    "hence we must keep the cutoff finite and smaller than @xmath110 , so that the theory does retain a slight inverse ",
    "power dependence on it . at any rate ,",
    "there exists a very wide window where this dependence is indeed very weak for couplings of order one or less , since @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , we see from eq .",
    "( [ nice ] ) that for @xmath112 much smaller than the landau pole there are two solutions for @xmath100 , one `` physical '' , always larger than @xmath101 and of the same order of @xmath113 , and one `` unphysical '' , close to the landau pole .",
    "one can now easily verify that the effective potential has indeed a unique minimum in @xmath98 , as required .",
    "in fact , if we assign arbitrary @xmath114dependent values to the widths @xmath83 , ( minus ) the effective force reads @xmath115 and reduces to @xmath116 when the widths are extremal as in eq .",
    "( [ massive ] ) ; but @xmath117 is positive for unbroken symmetry and so @xmath98 is the unique minimum .",
    "we define the symmetry as broken whenever the infinite volume @xmath118 has more than one minimum .",
    "of course , as long as @xmath18 is finite , @xmath118 has a unique minimum in @xmath98 , because of the uniqueness of the ground state in quantum mechanics , as already discussed in section [ cft ] .",
    "let us therefore proceed more formally and take the limit @xmath50 directly on the potential energy @xmath96 .",
    "it reads @xmath119 where we write for convenience the tree ",
    "level potential @xmath7 in the positive definite form @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath96 is now the sum of two positive definite terms .",
    "suppose there exists a configuration such that @xmath121 and the first term in @xmath96 is at its minimum .",
    "then this is certainly the absolute minimum of @xmath96 .",
    "this configuration indeed exists at infinite volume when @xmath41 : @xmath122\\ ] ] where the nonnegative @xmath69 should be regarded as an independent parameter fixing the scale of the symmetry breaking .",
    "it replaces the mass parameter @xmath101 of the unbroken symmetry case : now the theory is massless in accordance with goldstone theorem . on the contrary , if @xmath106 this configuration is not allowed due to the infrared divergences caused by the massless nature of the width spectrum .",
    "this is just the standard manifestation of mermin  wagner ",
    "coleman theorem that forbids continuous symmetry breaking in a two  dimensional space ",
    "time @xcite .    at finite volumes",
    "we can not minimize the first term in @xmath96 since this requires @xmath14 to diverge , making it impossible to keep @xmath121 .",
    "in fact we know that the uniqueness of the ground state with finitely many degrees of freedom implies the minimization equations ( [ massive ] ) to hold always true with a @xmath117 strictly positive . therefore , broken symmetry should manifest itself as the situation in which the equilibrium value of @xmath117 is a positive definite function of @xmath18 which vanishes in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "we can confirm this qualitative conclusion as follows .",
    "we assume that the bare mass has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ minimum ] ) and that @xmath123 too . minimizing",
    "the potential energy leads always to the massive spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ massive ] ) , with the gap equation @xmath124 if @xmath125 does not vanish too fast for large volumes , or stays even finite , then the sum on the modes has a behavior similar to the corresponding infinite volume integral : there is a quadratic divergence that cancels the infinite volume contribution , and a logarithmic one that renormalizes the bare coupling .",
    "the direct computation of the integral would produce a term containing the @xmath126 .",
    "this can be split into @xmath127 $ ] by using @xmath69 as mass scale .",
    "the first term renormalizes the coupling correctly , while the second one vanishes if @xmath117 vanishes in the infinite volume limit .    when @xmath50 , the asymptotic solution of ( [ gapagain ] ) reads @xmath128 that indeed vanishes in the limit .",
    "note also that the exponent is consistent with the assumption made above that @xmath100 vanishes slowly enough to approximate the sum over @xmath79 with an integral with the same @xmath100 .",
    "let us now consider a state whose field expectation value @xmath129 is different from @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath131 , the minimization equations ( [ massive ] ) leads to a positive squared mass spectrum for the fluctuations , with @xmath117 given self ",
    "consistently by the gap equation . on the contrary , as soon as @xmath132 , one immediately see that a positive @xmath117 can not solve the gap equation @xmath133 if we insist on the requirement that @xmath14 not be macroscopic .",
    "in fact , the r.h.s . of the previous equation is negative , no matter which positive value for the effective mass we choose , at least for @xmath18 large enough . but nothing prevent us to consider a static configuration for which the amplitude of the zero mode is macroscopically large ( i.e. it rescales with the volume @xmath134 ) .",
    "actually , if we choose @xmath135 we obtain the same equation as we did before and the same value for the potential , that is the minimum , in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "note that at this level the effective mass @xmath100 needs not to have the same behavior in the @xmath136 limit , but it is free of rescaling with a different power of @xmath18",
    ". we can be even more precise : we isolate the part of the potential that refers to the zero mode width @xmath14 ( @xmath137 does not contain the @xmath14 contribution ) @xmath138 \\frac{\\s _ 0 ^2}{l ^3 } + \\frac{\\lbare}4 \\frac{\\s _ 0 ^4}{l ^6 } + \\frac{1}{8 l ^3 \\sigma _ 0 ^2}\\ ] ] and we minimize it , keeping @xmath129 fixed .",
    "the minimum is attained at @xmath139 solution of the cubic equation @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "note that @xmath142 depends on @xmath18 and it has a finite limit in infinite volume : @xmath143 .",

    "the stability equations for all the other modes can now be solved by a massive spectrum , in a much similar way as before .",
    "since @xmath14 is now macroscopically large , the infinite volume limit of the @xmath83 distribution ( that gives a measure of the _ transverse _ fluctuations in the @xmath85 model ) develop a @xmath146like singularity , signalling a bose condensation of the goldstone bosons : @xmath147 at the same time it is evident that the minimal potential energy is the same as when @xmath148 , that is the effective potential flattens , in accord with the maxwell construction .",

    "( [ broken ] ) holds , symmetry breaking can be inferred from the limit @xmath154 , if clustering is assumed @xcite , since @xmath151 vanishes for large separations .",
    "of course this contradicts the infinite volume limit of the finite  volume definition , @xmath155 , except at the extremal points @xmath156 .",
    "in fact the @xmath50 limit of the finite volume states with @xmath157 do violate clustering , because they are linear superpositions of vectors belonging to superselected sectors and therefore they are indistinguishable from statistical mixtures .",

    "this averaging is necessarily uniform and is forced upon us by the residual @xmath158 symmetry .",
    "we now turn to the dynamics out of equilibrium in this large @xmath1 context .",
    "it is governed by the equations of motion derived from the total energy density @xmath159 in eq .",

    "( [ nefforce ] ) : when the widths @xmath83 are extremal the effective force is finite , and therefore so are all potential energy differences .",

    "( [ inis ] ) holds at least for @xmath26 large enough , solving the issue raised in the first point : negative @xmath117 are allowed by imposing a new form of gap equation @xmath167\\ ] ] where all @xmath83 with @xmath168 are kept free ( but all by hypothesis microscopic ) initial conditions .",
    "of course there is no energy minimization in this case . to determine when this new form is required , we observe that , neglecting the inverse  power corrections in the uv cutoff we may write eq .",
    "( [ nbgap2 ] ) in the following form @xmath169 there exists a positive solution @xmath117 smoothly connected to the ground state , @xmath148 and @xmath170 , only provided @xmath171 .",
    "so , in the large @xmath1 limit , as soon as we start with @xmath172 , we can not satisfy the gap equation with a positive value of @xmath117 .",
    "once a definite choice of initial conditions is made , the system of differential equations ( [ sk2 ] ) , ( [ nunbgap ] ) or ( [ nbgap ] ) can be solved numerically with standard integration algorithms .",
    "this has been already done by several authors @xcite , working directly in infinite volume , with the following general results . in the case of unbroken symmetry",
    "it has been established that the @xmath83 corresponding to wavevectors @xmath26 in the so  called forbidden bands with parametric resonances grow exponentially in time until their growth is shut off by the back  reaction . for broken symmetry it is the region in @xmath173space with the spinodal instabilities caused by an initially negative @xmath117 , whose widths grow exponentially before the back  reaction shutoff .",
    "after the shutoff time the effective mass tends to a positive constant for unbroken symmetry and to zero for broken symmetry ( in d=3 ) , so that the only width with a chance to keep growing indefinitely is @xmath14 for broken symmetry .    of course , in all these approaches the integration over modes in the back ",
    "reaction @xmath174 can not be done exactly and is always replaced by a discrete sum of a certain type , depending on the details of the algorithms .",
    "hence there exists always an effective infrared cutoff , albeit too small to be detectable in the numerical outputs .",
    "a possible troublesome aspect of this is the proper identification of the zero  mode width @xmath14 .",
    "even if a ( rather arbitrary ) choice of discretization is made where a @xmath14 appears , it is not really possible to determine whether during the exponential growth or after such width becomes of the order of the volume .",
    "our aim is just to answer this question and therefore we perform our numerical evolution in finite volumes of several growing sizes .",
    "remanding to the appendix for the details of our method , we summarize our results in the next subsection .      after a careful study in @xmath41 of the scaling behavior of the dynamics with respect to different values of @xmath18 , the linear size of the system",
    ", we reached the following conclusion : there exist a @xmath175dependent time , that we denote by @xmath17 , that splits the evolution in two parts ; for @xmath176 , the behavior of the system does not differ appreciably from its counterpart at infinite volume , while finite volume effects abruptly alter the evolution as soon as @xmath177 exceeds @xmath17 ; moreover    * @xmath17 is proportional to the linear size of the box @xmath18 and so it rescales as the cubic root of the volume .",
    "* @xmath17 does not depend on the value of the quartic coupling constant @xmath178 , at least in a first approximation .",
    "the figures show the behavior of the width of the zero mode @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0 ] ) , of the squared effective mass @xmath117 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mass2 ] ) and of the back ",
    "reaction @xmath174 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sigma ] ) , in the more interesting case of broken symmetry .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen in several different ways ( see the appendix for details ) , but correspond to a negative @xmath117 at early times with the initial widths all microscopic , that is at most of order @xmath13 .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the zero  mode width @xmath14 , which is instead macroscopic in the lowest energy state when @xmath157 , as discussed above .",
    "as for the background , the figures are relative to the simplest case @xmath179 , but we have considered also initial conditions with @xmath180 , reproducing the `` dynamical maxwell construction '' observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at any rate , for the purposes of this work , above all it is important to observe that , due to the quantum back  reaction , @xmath117 rapidly becomes positive , within the so  called _ spinodal time _ @xcite , and then , for times before @xmath17 , the _ weakly dissipative _ regime takes place where @xmath117 oscillates around zero with amplitude decreasing as @xmath181 and a frequency fixed by the largest spinodal wavevector , in complete agreement with the infinite  volume results @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , after the exponential growth until the spinodal time , the width of the zero  mode grows on average linearly with time , reaching a maximum for @xmath182 .",
    "precisely , @xmath14 performs small amplitude oscillations with the same frequency of @xmath117 around a linear function of the form @xmath183 , where @xmath184 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0_l ] ) , confirming what already found in refs .",
    "@xcite ; then quite suddenly it turns down and enters long irregular poincar  like cycles .",
    "since the spinodal oscillation frequency does not depend appreciably on @xmath18 , the curves of @xmath14 at different values of @xmath18 are practically identical for @xmath185 . after a certain number of complete oscillations , a number that scales linearly with @xmath18 , a small change in the behavior of @xmath117 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : usc_mass ] ) determines an inversion in @xmath14 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : usc_zm ] ) , evidently because of a phase crossover between the two oscillation patterns . shortly after @xmath17 dissipation practically stops as the oscillations of @xmath117 stop decreasing in amplitude and become more and more irregular , reflecting the same irregularity in the evolution of the widths .",
    "we can give a straightforward physical interpretation for the presence of the time scale @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , long after the spinodal time @xmath5 , the effective mass oscillates around zero with a decreasing amplitude and affects the quantum fluctuations in such a way that the equal  time two  point correlation function contains a time ",
    "dependent non  perturbative disturbance growing at twice the speed of light .",
    "this is interpreted in terms of large numbers of goldstone bosons equally produced at any point in space ( due to translation invariance ) and radially propagating at the speed of light .",
    "this picture applies also at finite volumes , in the bulk , for volumes large enough .",
    "hence , due to our periodic boundary conditions , after a time exactly equal to @xmath186 the forward wave front meets the backward wave front at the opposite point with respect to the source , and the propagating wave starts interfering with itself and heavily changes the dynamics with respect to that in infinite volume .",
    "this argument leads us to give the value of @xmath187 for the proportionality coefficient between @xmath17 and @xmath188 , prevision very well verified by the numerical results , as can be inferred by a look at the figures .",
    "the main consequence of this scenario is that the linear growth of the zero  mode width at infinite volume should not be interpreted as a standard form of bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) , occurring with time , but should be consistently considered as `` novel '' form of dynamical bec , as found by the authors of @xcite .",
    "in fact , if a macroscopic condensation were really there , the zero mode would develop a @xmath189 function in infinite volume , that would be announced by a width of the zero mode growing to values @xmath190 at any given size @xmath18 .",
    "now , while it is surely true that when we push @xmath18 to infinity , also the time @xmath17 tends to infinity , allowing the zero mode to grow indefinitely , it is also true that , at any fixed though arbitrarily large volume , the zero mode never reaches a width @xmath190 , just because @xmath191 . in other words , if we start from initial conditions where @xmath14 is microscopic , then it never becomes macroscopic later on .",
    "on the other hand , looking at the behavior of the mode functions of momenta @xmath27 for @xmath71 fixed but for different values of @xmath18 , one realizes that they obey a scaling similar to that observed for the zero  mode : they oscillate in time with an amplitude and a period that are @xmath192 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] and [ fig : m1_l ] ) .",
    "thus , each mode shows a behavior that is exactly half a way between a macroscopic amplitude [ i.e. @xmath190 ] and a usual microscopic one [ i.e. at most @xmath194 .",
    "this means that the spectrum of the quantum fluctuations at times of the order of the diverging volume can be interpreted as a _ massless _ spectrum of _ interacting _ goldstone modes , because their power spectrum develops in the limit a @xmath195 singularity , rather than the @xmath196 pole typical of free massless modes . as a consequence",
    "the equal  time field correlation function [ see eq .",
    "( [ 2pn ] ) ] will fall off as @xmath197 for large separations smaller only than the diverging elapsed time .",
    "this is in accord with what found in @xcite , where the same conclusion where reached after a study of the correlation function for the scalar field in infinite volume .",
    "the fact that each mode never becomes macroscopic , if it started microscopic , might be regarded as a manifestation of unitarity in the large @xmath1 approximation : an initial gaussian state with only microscopic widths satisfies clustering and clustering can not be spoiled by a unitary time evolution . as a consequence , in the infinite  volume",
    "late  time dynamics , the zero  mode width @xmath14 does not play any special role and only the behavior of @xmath83 as @xmath198 is relevant .",
    "as already stated above , it turns out from our numerics as well as from refs .",
    "@xcite that this behavior is of a novel type characteristic both of the out  of  equilibrium dynamics and of the equilibrium finite  temperature theory @xcite , with @xmath199 .",
    "a final comment should be made about the periodic boundary conditions used for these simulations .",
    "this choice guarantees the translation invariance of the dynamics needed to consider a stable uniform background .",
    "if we had chosen other boundary conditions ( dirichlet or neumann , for instance ) , the translation symmetry would have been broken and an uniform background would have become non - uniform pretty soon .",
    "of course , we expect the bulk behavior to be independent of the particular choice for the boundary conditions in the infinite volume limit , even if a rigorous proof of this statement is still lacking .",
    "in this work we have presented a rather detailed study of the dynamical evolution out of equilibrium , in finite volume ( a cubic box of size @xmath18 in @xmath200d ) , for the @xmath2 qft in the large @xmath1 limit . for comparison",
    ", we have also analyzed some static characteristics of the theory both in unbroken and broken symmetry phases .",
    "we have reached the conclusion , based on strong numerical evidence , that the linear growth of the zero  mode quantum fluctuations , observed already in the large @xmath1 approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , may be consistently interpreted as a `` novel '' form of dynamical bose  einstein condensation , different from the traditional one in finite temperature field theory at equilibrium .",
    "in fact , in finite volume , @xmath14 never grows to @xmath190 if it starts from a microscopic value , that is at most of order @xmath13 . on the other hand all long  wavelength fluctuations rapidly become of order @xmath18 , signalling a novel infrared behavior quite different from free massless fields at equilibrium [ recall that the large @xmath1 approximation is of mean field type , with no direct interaction among particle excitations ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the properties of the two  point function determined in @xcite .",
    "the numerical evidence for the linear dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath18 is very strong , and the qualitative argument given in the previous section clearly explains the physics that determines it .",
    "nonetheless a solid analytic understanding of the detailed ( quantitative ) mechanism that produces the inversion of @xmath201 around @xmath17 and its subsequent irregular behavior , is , at least in our opinion , more difficult to obtain .",
    "one could use intuitive and generic arguments like the quantization of momentum in multiples of @xmath202 , but the evolution equations do not have any simple scaling behavior towards a universal form , when mass dimensions are expressed in multiples of @xmath202 and time in multiples of @xmath18 . moreover , the qualitative form of the evolution depends heavily on our choice of initial conditions .",
    "in fact , before finite volumes effects show up , the trajectories of the quantum modes are rather complex but regular enough , having a small - scale quasi - periodic almost mode - independent motion within a large - scale quasi - periodic mode - dependent envelope , with a very delicate resonant equilibrium [ cfr . fig . 1 and 7 ] . apparently [ cfr . fig . 5 and 6 ] ,",
    "it is a sudden small beat that causes the turn around of the zero - mode and of the other low - lying modes ( with many thousands of coupled modes , it is very difficult for the delicate resonant equilibrium to fully come back ever again ) , but we think that a deeper comprehension of the non  linear coupled dynamics is needed in order to venture into a true analytic explanation .    on the other hand it is not difficult to understand why @xmath17 does not depend appreciably on the coupling constant : when finite - volume effects first come in , that is when the wave propagating at the speed of light first starts to interfere with itself , the quantum back - reaction @xmath203 has settled on values of order 1 , because the time @xmath204 is much greater than the spinodal time @xmath5 .",
    "the slope of the linear envelope of the zero mode does depend on @xmath178 because it is fixed by the early exponential growth .",
    "similarly , it is easy to realize that the numerical integrations of refs .",
    "@xcite over continuum momenta correspond roughly to an effective volume much larger than ours , so that the calculated evolution remained far away from the onset of finite - volume effects .",
    "the main limitation of the large @xmath1 approximation , as far as the evolution of the widths @xmath83 is concerned , is in its intrinsic gaussian nature .",
    "in fact , one might envisage a scenario in which , while gaussian fluctuations stay microscopic , non  gaussian fluctuations grow in time to a macroscopic size .",
    "therefore , in order to clarify this point and go beyond the gaussian approximation , we are going to consider , in a forthcoming work @xcite , a time ",
    "dependent hf approximation capable in principle of describing the dynamics of non  gaussian fluctuation of a single scalar field with @xmath2 interaction .",
    "another open question concerns the connection between the minima of the effective potential and the asymptotic values for the evolution of the background , within the simplest gaussian approximation .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , a dynamical maxwell construction occurs for the @xmath85 model in infinite volume and at leading order in @xmath54 in case of broken symmetry , in the sense that any value of the background within the spinodal region can be obtained as large time limit of the evolution starting from suitable initial conditions",
    ". it would be very enlightening if we could prove this `` experimental '' result by first principles arguments , based on ctp formalism .",
    "furthermore , preliminary numerical evidence @xcite suggests that something similar occurs also in the hartree approximation for a single field , but a more thorough and detailed analysis is needed",
    ".    it would be interesting also to study the dynamical realization of the goldstone paradigm , namely the asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass in the broken symmetry phases , in different models ; this issue needs further study in the @xmath205 case @xcite , where it is known that the goldstone theorem is not valid .",

    "the gap equation is a viable mean for fixing the initial conditions only when @xmath228 lies outside the spinodal region [ see eq ( [ nicen ] ) ] ; otherwise , the gap equation does not admit a positive solution for the squared effective mass . in that case",

    "there is actually a third possibility , that is in some sense half a way between the unbroken and broken symmetry case .",
    "we could allow for a time dependent bare mass , in such a way to simulate a sort of _ cooling down _ of the system . in order to do that",
    ", we could start with a unbroken symmetry bare potential ( which fixes initial conditions naturally via the gap equation ) and then turn to a broken symmetry one after a short interval of time .",
    "this evolution is achieved by a proper interpolation in time of the two inequivalent parameterizations of the bare mass , eqs .",
