    "up to now , though all experiments do not deny that the universe people live in a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time , we need not to believe absolutely that our universe must be so@xcite .",
    "perhaps our universe is only a domain of a higher dimensional space - time , which we do not realize at this moment .",
    "this thought is inspired by the quickly development of string theory recently .",
    "consequently , there must be critical differences in physics between our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional universe inside and outside .",
    "new phenomena need to be investigated to some extent .",
    "an interesting non - isotropic abelian lattice gauge model on the existence of a high dimensional space - time has been proposed in ref.@xcite by one of us , fu , and nielsen , where the coupling constants of gauge interactions depend on the spatial - time directions . a new phase ,",
    "@xmath5-dimensional layer phase , has been found in a @xmath6-dimensional @xmath7 non - isotropic u(1 ) lattice gauge model at zero temperature by using mean field method and strong coupling corrections .",
    "the results have been confirmed by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation@xcite and by other method , e.g. , by using the variational - cumulant expansion approach@xcite .",
    "further investigation show that the layer phase exists in the non - isotropic z(2)@xcite , non - abelian su(2)@xcite ( confirmed by mc simulation@xcite ) and su(3)@xcite lattice gauge model , also exists in the non - isotropic u(1 ) lattice gauge model with bosons@xcite and fermions@xcite at zero temperature .",
    "furthermore , recent works confirm the exists of layer phase in non - isotropic u(1 ) lattice gauge model in ref@xcite and show that the layer physe exists in the non - isotropic u(1 ) lattice gauge model with higgs@xcite .",
    "the phase structure of non - isotropic u(1)@xcite and su(2)@xcite lattice gauge model at finite temperature has been studied with the variational - cumulant expansion model , the layer phase is also found which is different from the zero temperature case . in this paper , we shall use the variational - cumulant expansion approach@xcite to investigate the phase structure of the non - isotropic non - abelian su(3 ) lattice gauge model at finite temperature .",
    "if we suppose that there is a @xmath6-dimensional space - time described by su(3 ) gauge symmetry with the coupling constants depending on the spatial - time directions .",
    "then the wilson action of this non - isotropic su(3 ) lattice pure gauge model is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an ordered product of @xmath10su(3 ) around a plaquette , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the space - time directions , @xmath13 is the rank of su(3 ) .",
    "since the key point of the finite temperature lattice gauge field theory is to establish an appropriate partition function with a periodic boundary condition of the field in the time - like direction(s ) , the time - like link(s ) and space - like links must be treated differently , in the non - isotropic su(3 ) lattice gauge model at finite temperature , we suppose that there is only a one - dimension time - like direction which is defined along the @xmath5th direction in the @xmath6-dimensional non - isotropic space - time lattice . furthermore , we suppose there is a @xmath5-dimensional subspace which are @xmath5 dimensional space - time including the time - like direction in the @xmath6-dimensional space - time lattice . in the @xmath5 dimensional subspace",
    "the coupling coefficients are assumed identical and called @xmath14 , the remaining @xmath15 coupling coefficients are also taken to be identical and we call them @xmath16 .",
    "the reason we choose two different coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath16 are that in one side our familiar universe is an isotropic system , and on the other side we mainly attempt to show the differences between the non - isotropic gauge system and our familiar isotropic gauge system .",
    "having these supposition , the wilson action of the non - isotropic su(3 ) lattice gauge model at finite temperature can be written as :    @xmath17\\ ] ] @xmath18,\\ ] ]    here one may consider the first term as an `` inside layer '' and the second term represents an interaction between different layers . where @xmath11 , @xmath12(@xmath19 ) , @xmath20(@xmath21 ) and @xmath22(@xmath23 ) are space - like directions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the space - like plaquettes , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the time - like plaquettes .",
    "the summations @xmath28 are taken over all such plaquettes .",
    "the corresponding partition function of the system is : @xmath29e^{s}.\\ ] ] in general , it is very difficult to calculate the partition function of a certain system . according to the variational - cumulant expansion method ,",
    "if one introduce a trial action , the calculation of partition function will become simple .",
    "we introduce a trial action : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real variational parameters corresponding to the space - like link variable @xmath35 , the time - like variable @xmath36 in the @xmath5-dimensional subspace , and the space - like variable @xmath37 in the remaining ( d - d ) directions , respectively . for the convenience of calculation",
    ", we let @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding trial partition function of the virtual system can be calculated by vce@xcite : @xmath41e^{s_0}\\ ] ] then the partition function of a genuine system can be achieved via the trial system as : @xmath29e^{s}=\\int[du]e^{s_0 } e^{s - s_0}=z(j_\\sigma , j_{\\sigma'})_0\\left\\langle e^{s - s_0 } \\right\\rangle_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath42(\\cdots)e^{s_0}\\ ] ] expresses statistics average in the trial system .",
    "now , let us introduce the order parameter , polyakov line , which can be used as a criterion of phase transition of a given system : @xmath43le^{s}\\ ] ] @xmath44l e^{s - s_0}e^{s_0}=\\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n ! } \\langle l(s - s_0)^n\\rangle_c\\equiv \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n!}\\langle l_n\\rangle_c\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the periodic condition , @xmath46 indicates the cumulant average in the trial system which can be expanded in the statistical averages and the lower order cumulant averages@xcite . for example @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 in this work , we calculate the order parameter polyakov line to 3rd order(n=2 ) .",
    "in principle , we can calculate the polyakov line to any desired orders using the vce method and obtain the exact polyakov line of the real system without any dependence on the variational parameters @xmath32 and @xmath34 . in practice",
    ", we can only expand @xmath51 to some limited terms and the expansion eq.(8 ) must be truncated at some order @xmath52(in our work , the @xmath51 is expanded to @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath51 turns out to depend on @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the choice of the parameter @xmath32 and @xmath34 will affect the rate of convergence of the expansion .",
    "we use the convexity inequality to obtain the best values of @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "first , we introduce the equation of free energy , @xmath54 where the @xmath55 and @xmath56 $ ] represent the free energy of the real system and trial system . then we get the standard convexity inequality equation is @xmath57=-ln[z(j_\\sigma , j_{\\sigma'})_0\\left\\langle e^{s - s_0 } \\right\\rangle_0 ] \\leq - ln[z(j_\\sigma , j_{\\sigma'})_0]-\\langle s - s_0\\rangle_0=w_{eff},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the upper bound of the free energy .",
    "so , the variational parameters @xmath32 and @xmath59 are determined by minimizing the @xmath58 : @xmath60 which lead to @xmath61 @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the single link group integral , for example , the definition of @xmath63 is @xmath65e^{tr(j_{\\sigma}u^{+}+uj_{\\sigma}^{+})},\\ ] ] @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the corresponding differential of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "eq.(10 ) have solutions in the following forms : + @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72 , + @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath71 @xmath72 , + @xmath76 @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "+ corresponding to the three kinds of solutions there are three kinds of phases : + @xmath79 the high - temperature phase corresponding to solution @xmath68 .",
    "the order parameter is : @xmath80 @xmath81 the layer phase corresponding to solution @xmath73 .",
    "the order parameter is : @xmath82 @xmath83 the low temperature solution corresponding to solution @xmath76 .",
    "the order parameter is : @xmath84 here @xmath51 is calculated to the terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and the calculation is very tedious , we will not show it here .",
    "base on the vce approach to 3rd order , we obtained the layer phase diagrams of the non - isotropic su(3 ) lattice gauge model at finite temperatures shown in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "as indicated by the lattice gauge field theory of zero temperature@xcite , the layer phase of @xmath87 is unstable , but stable when @xmath88 at zero temperature .",
    "while in our calculation of finite temperature the layer phases exist and are stable when @xmath89 for a fixed @xmath90 value ( here @xmath45 ) , which corresponds to a not very low temperature , as @xmath91 for zero temperature .",
    "it implies that there must be a transition temperature at which the layer phase turns to be unstable .",
    "unfortunately , for the case of larger @xmath90 value , the calculations with vce are too complicated and difficult to carry out .",
    "the triple points of phase diagram in fig.1 and fig.2 are located at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "we do not calculate the cases when @xmath94 , but by our experience , the layer phase will exist in those cases . for conclusion , using vce approach , we get information about the layer phase : the layer phase exist in the non - isotropic non - abelian su(3 ) gauge model , which conform the former imagination@xcite that the layer phase not only exist in the non - isotropic u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge model , but also in other non - isotropic gauge models .",
    "but in this work we can only obtain that the layer phase exists at a very high temperature in the non - isotropic su(3 ) gauge model , we can not give the exact temperature at which there is phase transition and the layer phase disappear .",
    "so , further investigation is needed .",
