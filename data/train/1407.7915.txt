    "@xcite , the hsn bifurcation was reported to occur in this system .",
    "we anticipate that the origin of the scaling law is the same as that for our system .    however , there is some evidence for the conventional sn bifurcation near the critical velocity of a superfluid in the presence of an obstacle @xcite .",

    "the metastable and unstable states approach each other in the configuration space , and thus the landscape around the local minimum becomes flat along a particular direction in the coordinate space .",

    "on the basis of the results in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluctuation_2d ] , we see that the motion of @xmath133 from the metastable state to the unstable state is accompanied by a density fluctuation near the defect potential .",
    "the decay of supercurrent is frequently understood on the basis of the energy landscape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_picture ] . recall that the phase slip rate for one - dimensional ring systems has been calculated in @xcite , where the conventional swallowtail structure plays a crucial role .",
    "our results imply that the conventional energy landscape , _",

    "[ fig : energy_diagram_sw_32_5_25 ] and [ fig : energy_diagram_sw_48_5_25 ] ) .",
    "away from the critical velocity , the energy landscape can not be written in the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_picture ] and we expect that the multiple - swallowtail structure affects the phase slip rate .",
    "in summary , we investigated the metastability , excitations , fluctuations , and swallowtail structures of the bec with a uniformly moving defect in a two - dimensional torus system .",
    "we first calculated the total energy and the total momentum as functions of the driving velocity of the moving defect .",
    "a negative effective - mass region appears near the critical velocity , as is the case for optical lattice systems .",
    "in contrast to optical lattice systems , the negative effective - mass states are metastable .",
    "this difference comes from that the di in the optical lattice systems is due to the formation of the long - period structures , such as the period - doubling states and the bright gap solitons , which are prohibited in the torus systems .",
    "we also found gvps in stationary states in the presence of a strong defect .    using the results of the gp equation",
    ", we solved the bogoliubov equation and obtained the excitation spectra .",
    "we determined that near the critical velocity , the scaling of the energy gap followed a one - fourth power law .",
    "this implies an algebraic divergence of the characteristic time scale toward the critical velocity and a violation of the adiabaticity condition at the critical velocity .    from wave functions of the excited states",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 , we obtained the fluctuation properties and showed that the density ( amplitude of the order parameter ) fluctuations are enhanced near the critical velocity .",
    "we also calculated the qd and found that it increased near the critical velocity .",
    "we confirmed the validity of the gp and the bogoliubov approximations on the basis of these results .",
    "we found unconventional swallowtail structures ( multiple - swallowtail structure ) by the direct calculations of the unstable solutions .",
    "we discussed that the number of unstable branches depends on the width of the superflow path and expect that the multiple - swallowtail structure reduces to the conventional one in the narrow superflow path limit .",
    "we discussed the bifurcation structure of the system .",
    "the results for the one - fourth power - law scaling near the critical velocity and the unstable branches imply that the hsn bifurcation occurs in the system , which describes the disappearance of the energy barrier that protects a metastable state .",
    "we pointed out that the same scaling law appears in the attractive bec in a harmonic trap near the collapse point .",
    "we also discussed the effects of the multiple - swallowtail structure on the calculations for the phase slip rate .    in future work , we will attempt to determine why the hamiltonian saddle - node bifurcation appears at the critical velocity and to derive the normal form from the gp and bogoliubov equations .",
    "the energy landscape away from the critical velocity remains open .",
    "full knowledge of the energy landscape of the multiple - swallowtail structures will serve as the understanding of the breakdown of the superfluidity due to the vortex nucleations .",
    "a possible further extension of the present work is to study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the metastability of superfluidity . in particular , these effects are crucial for cases that are not weakly interacting and that are near the critical velocity .",
    "in fact , a nonzero drag force acting on a defect below the critical velocity in a one - dimensional system has been reported in ref .",
    "this phenomenon is due to quantum fluctuations .",

    "the method is as follows : in uniform two - dimensional systems , the cutoff dependence of the quantum depletion is given by @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the cutoff wave number .",
    "therefore , we assume the same cutoff dependence of the quantum depletion even in the presence of the defect potential . by adjusting @xmath190 and @xmath191 , we can fit the function @xmath192 to three data points , and in this way , we can calculate the quantum depletion .",

    "<S> we solve the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) and bogoliubov equations to investigate the metastability of superfluidity in a bose - einstein condensate in the presence of a uniformly moving defect potential in a two - dimensional torus . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the total energy and momentum as functions of the driving velocity of the moving defect and find metastable states with negative effective - mass near the critical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the first excited energy ( energy gap ) in the finite - sized torus closes at the critical velocity , that it obeys one - fourth power - law scaling , and that the dynamical fluctuation of the density ( amplitude of the order parameter ) is strongly enhanced near the critical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the validity of our results near the critical velocity by calculating the quantum depletion . </S>",
    "<S> we find an unconventional swallowtail structure ( multiple - swallowtail structure ) through calculations of the unstable stationary solutions of the gp equation . </S>"
