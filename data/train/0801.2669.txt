    "the transport of different extensive quantities like energy , heat , entropy , mass , charge , magnetization , etc .",
    ", through and within solid state systems is an intensively studied topic of nonequilibrium statistical dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , there are numerous open questions concerning the type of transport especially in small systems far from the thermodynamic limit and in particular in quantum mechanics . at the heart of many investigations",
    "is the classification into two main categories : _ normal _ or _ diffusive _ transfer of the extensive quantity and _ ballistic _ transport featuring a divergence of the conductivity .",
    "diffusive transport occurs whenever the system is governed by a diffusion equation .",
    "in particular , this means that excitations decay exponentially fast and the spatial variance of an initial excitation grows linear in time .",
    "ballistic transport , however , is rather described by the equations of motion of a free particle . for the spatial variance of an excitation",
    "this implies a quadratic growth in time .    in the present paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the transport of energy and heat in quantum systems .",
    "there are several different approaches discussed in the literature to investigate the transport of those quantities in quantum mechanics .",
    "one very famous ansatz is the investigation of heat transport in terms of the green - kubo formula @xcite .",
    "a main advantage of this approach is certainly its computability after having diagonalized the system s hamiltonian .",
    "derived on the basis of linear response theory the kubo formula has originally been formulated for electrical transport @xcite , where an external potential can be written as an addend to the hamiltonian of the system . basically one finds a current - current autocorrelation , which has _",
    "ad hoc _ been transferred to heat transport simply by replacing the electrical current by a heat current @xcite .",
    "however , the justification of this replacement remains unclear since there is no way of expressing a temperature gradient in terms of an addend to the hamiltonian of the system as before @xcite .",
    "other approaches to heat conductivity in quantum systems are based on diagonalization of the schrdinger equation @xcite , analyzing the level statistics of the hamiltonian @xcite or by an explicit coupling to some environments of different temperature @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "environments are described by a quantum master equation @xcite in liouville space . here",
    "the temperature differences can , indeed , be described by a perturbation operator so that one may treat a thermal perturbation in this extended state space similar as an electrical one in the hilbert space @xcite .    the hilbert space average method @xcite allows for a direct investigation of the heat transport in quantum systems from schrdinger dynamics . by deriving a reduced dynamical equation for a class of design quantum systems , normal heat transport as well as fourier s law",
    "has been confirmed @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for diffusive systems the hilbert space average method is equivalent to a projection operator technique with an extended projection superoperator @xcite .",
    "however , ballistic behavior can not be analyzed with the hilbert space average method in a straightforward manner since it is not obvious how to obtain time - dependent rates .",
    "using a correlated superprojection operator within the derivation of the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) quantum master equation leads to a reduced dynamical description of the investigated system . the main advantage of the correlated tcl method refers to its perturbation theoretical character .",
    "thus it is a systematic expansion in some perturbational parameter .    to use this alternative method for an investigation of the transport behavior of a quantum system ,",
    "it is necessary to partition the microscopic system described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 into mesoscopic subunits . while the complete dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation of the full system according to its density operator @xmath1\\equiv\\mathcal{l}(t)\\hat{\\rho},\\ ] ] we aim at deriving a closed reduced dynamical equation for the subunits chosen .",
    "formally , this partitioning is done by introducing a projection superoperator @xmath2 that projects onto the relevant part of the full density matrix @xmath3 @xcite , here the spatial energy distribution within the system . however , by a straightforward application of the projection superoperator on the above equation , the dynamics of the reduced system is no longer unitary , but described by @xmath4    these effective equations of motion for the relevant part @xmath5 can either be written as an integro - differential equation ( nakajima - zwanzig equation @xcite ) or as a time - convolutionless ( tcl ) master equation @xcite , which is an ordinary linear differential equation of first order .",
    "both methods allow for a systematic perturbative expansion . in the tcl expansion series the first - order term typically vanishes and thus the leading order is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath6 however , in order to obtain a converging perturbation series expansion @xmath2 should not be chosen arbitrarily : a `` wrong '' projection superoperator may lead to a breakdown of the expansion @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model composed of two - level systems .",
    "the coupling between the atoms is anisotropic , i.e. , in one direction dominated by a heisenberg interaction whereas the coupling in all other directions is random .",
    "the choice of random couplings ensures that the interaction is unbiased as it does not have any special symmetry .",
    "two - level atoms or spin-@xmath7 systems @xcite allow to study a large variety of quantum effects from quantum information processing to solid state theory , described by a rather simple interaction , making them interesting both from an experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "of particular interest are the transport properties of systems containing 1d and 2d spin structures , e.g. , the investigations of heat transport in cuprates , in which a dramatic heat transport anisotropy has been reported @xcite . while the anisotropy is mainly attributed to anisotropic phonon scattering processes , we investigate transport anisotropies emerging from an anisotropic ( but coherent ) interaction .",

    "[ fig:3d ] . in terms of pauli operators",
    "the local hamiltonian of the network is given by @xmath8 with the local energy splitting @xmath9 defining the basic energy unit within our model .    in @xmath10 direction ,",
    "the two - level systems are coupled via a heisenberg interaction @xmath11 with the pauli spin vectors @xmath12 at site @xmath13 .    in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions ,",
    "we use a random interaction matrix @xmath16 to couple both adjacent sites and next neighbor sites lying diagonally opposite [ see lower left corner of fig .",

    "the nonzero matrix elements are taken from a gaussian ensemble with zero mean and a variance @xmath17 .",
    "while each matrix element is taken from the same ensemble , the geometry of the system requires that we do not have translational invariance within the random interaction .    to investigate the transport in @xmath10 or @xmath15 direction , respectively ( cf .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ) , we perform a partition of the model into @xmath18 subunits .",
    "a layer of @xmath19 two - level systems is grouped together into a new local subsystem , coupled to adjacent layers by the connections between pairs of two level systems . because of the anisotropy within the model we can study the transport perpendicular to the heisenberg chains in the @xmath15 direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig:3d](a ) ] and along the chains in @xmath10 direction [ fig .",

    "the coupling strength of an arbitrary interaction matrix @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the dimension of the matrix ( see @xcite ) . for the random interaction",
    "we choose the variance @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath23 for all interaction matrices coupling adjacent subunits .",
    "the complete hamiltonian of the full model system is thus described by @xmath24 because of the normalization of the interaction matrices the numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 define the coupling strength between different sites .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath25 for the heisenberg interaction and @xmath26 for the random interaction are chosen so that @xmath27 , which is known as the weak coupling limit .",
    "regardless of the partition scheme chosen ( in the @xmath10 or @xmath15 direction ) each subunit can be seen as a molecule consisting of several energy bands .",
    "however , the solution for the complete system is computationally unfeasible for more than a few sites .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to initial states where only one site is excited ( or superpositions thereof ) the heisenberg interaction does not allow to leave this subspace of the total hilbert space . by choosing also the random interaction to conserve this subspace",
    "we restrict all further investigations to the single excitation subspace .",
    "figure  [ fig : dingsbums ] gives a graphical representation of our system , with @xmath28 being the width of the first energy band ( all higher excitation bands are neglected here ) .",

    "let us consider the transport perpendicular to the heisenberg chains ( in the @xmath15 direction ) first .",
    "then , the partitioning into subunits yields the following mesoscopic hamiltonian consisting of a local and an interaction part @xmath31here @xmath32 of subunit @xmath33 consists of the constant local energy splitting , the heisenberg interaction , and the internal random couplings of each subunit [ cf .",

    "equation ( [ eq : rate ] ) is basically a rate equation for the probabilities to find an excitation in subunit @xmath33 .",
    "since the interaction between two adjacent subunits is a random matrix with the above described properties , all matrix elements are approximately of the same size .",
    "that means that the rate does not depend on the subunit @xmath33 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can assume @xmath50 , finding @xmath51 in the following the double sum is treated analogous to the derivation of fermi s golden rule .    since the sine cardinal ( sinc ) of eq .",

    "since we have neglected the internal random interaction completely , the state density of the first excitation subspace is just given by the state density of a heisenberg spin chain @xmath58 unfortunately , this function is not square integrable due to singularities at the boundaries of the spectrum .",
