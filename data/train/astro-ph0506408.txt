    "2003 ) , have established that these molecules are largely enhanced ( @xmath510@xmath6 ) due to the release of material from grains .",
    "since silicon is heavily depleted onto grains ( ziurys , friberg , & irvine 1989 ; martn  pintado , bachiller , & fuente 1992 ) and ch@xmath0oh has been firmly detected on icy mantles ( tielens & allamandola 1987 ) , sio and ch@xmath0oh are accepted to be ejected from grains . for the sulfur chemistry ,",
    "since h@xmath1s is predicted to be efficiently formed on grain surfaces ( duley , millar , & williams 1980 ) , this molecule is assumed to initiate this chemistry ( charnley 1997 ) .",
    "however , h@xmath1s has not been detected so far in solid state @xcite .",
    "although other species like ocs have been proposed to play an important role in the sulfur chemistry @xcite , the question of which sulfur  bearing molecule is ejected from grains still remains uncertain .",

    "; markwick , millar , & charnley 2000 ) , much shorter than the typical ages of evolved outflows .",
    "the study of the chemistry of very young outflows like l1448mm with dynamical time  scales ( t@xmath53500@xmath4yr ) similar to the chemical time  scales , offers the possibility to establish which molecules are formed or depleted onto grains and which ones are generated in gas phase .",
    "in particular , since magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) c  shocks are initiated by the magnetic precursor , one can directly measure the material released from grains by observing the gas recently affected by the precursor .",
    "the detection of extremely narrow sio emission toward l1448mm , and the increase of the molecular ion abundances , have been interpreted as signatures of the interaction of the precursor @xcite .",
    "measurements of the abundances of shock tracers in the shock  precursor stage can therefore help to establish the molecules that are present on grain mantles .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of the sulfur  chemistry .    in this letter , we present observations of key shock tracers like sio , ch@xmath0oh , so , cs , h@xmath1s , ocs and so@xmath1 , toward the l1448mm outflow . the enhanced abundances of sio , ch@xmath0oh ,",
    "so , and cs in the shock  precursor and the postshock components indicate the recent ejection of these molecules from grains .",
    "this enhancement , the lack of so@xmath1 and ocs , and the fact that h@xmath1s is only enhanced in the shock  precursor component , indicate that the sulfur chemistry in l1448mm strongly depends on the evolution of the chemical composition of grains .",

    "the very narrow ( @xmath50.6@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 ) sio emission detected at 5.2@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 with an abundance of @xmath510@xmath23 , and the enhancement of the molecular ions like h@xmath8co@xmath9 and n@xmath1h@xmath9 , have been proposed as signatures of the interaction of the c  shock precursor ( jimnez  serra et al .",

    "this is even more clear toward l1448mm ( 0,20 ) , where the velocity peaks of these molecules are slightly redshifted ( @xmath55.45.6@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 ) just in the same direction as the broader postshock gas , suggesting that the material is already accelerated by the precursor . like sio , the abundances of ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath1s , so , and",

    "ocs and so@xmath1 are undetected also at this component ( see fig.@xmath42 ) .",
    "l1448mm ( 0,20 ) is the only position where sio shows broad emission suggesting that the gas has already entered the shock ( @xmath24@xmath510@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 ; jimnez  serra et al .",
    "as expected for ch@xmath0oh , so , and cs , these molecules also present broad line profiles toward this position .",
    "the sio and ch@xmath0oh abundances enhanced by a factor of @xmath51000 in the postshock gas ( @xmath510@xmath15 and 10@xmath25 respectively ; fig.@xmath42 ) , are similar to those observed in other outflows ( bachiller & prez gutirrez 1997 ; blake et al .",
    "1987 ) , suggesting the idea that icy mantles have been completely removed from grains ( nearly 90% of the mantle material is injected into gas phase for @xmath24@xmath1815@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 ; caselli , hartquist , & havnes 1997 ) .",
    "the enhancement by also three orders of magnitude of so and cs in the postshock regime ( fig.@xmath42 ) clearly contrasts with the lack of broad h@xmath1s emission toward l1448mm ( 0,20 ) ( fig.@xmath41 ) .",
    "the upper limits to the h@xmath1s abundance of @xmath1810@xmath15 are a factor of 10 smaller than those observed in evolved outflows ( @xmath510@xmath6 ; blake et al . 1987 ; bachiller & prez gutirrez 1997 ) and predicted by sulfur chemistry models with injection of h@xmath1s from grains ( charnley 1997 ) . since we do not either detect ocs or so@xmath1 arising from the postshock gas ( fig.@xmath42 ) , so and cs are the most abundant sulfur  bearing molecules at the first stages of the shock evolution toward l1448mm .",
    "the molecular abundances are not significantly altered by the ejection of co from grains since its fractional abundance remains unchanged after mantle desorption ( markwick et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the observed trend in the shock tracers to be enhanced in the shock  precursor and the postshock components ( fig.@xmath42 ) , supports an evolutionary effect produced by the propagation of the shock into the ambient gas .",
    "the material affected by the young shocks in l1448mm has not reached the postshock chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "one then expects to distinguish between the molecules ejected from grains and the species generated in gas phase .",
    "this will help us to understand the peculiar grain chemistry observed toward l1448mm , specially in the case of the sulfur chemistry , which seems to be strongly dependent on the chemical `` history '' of the grain mantles in this region .",
    "the abundances of shock tracers like sio , ch@xmath0oh , so , cs or h@xmath1s in the preshock gas are similar to those found in dark clouds . as the shock aproaches the unperturbed gas , the first interaction will be driven by the precursor , modifying the physical conditions and the chemistry of the ambient cloud ( draine & mckee 1993 ) .",
    "serra et al . ( 2004 ) proposed that the enhancement of the ions in the shock  precursor component toward l1448mm , is explained by the interaction of the magnetic precursor that forces the ions to slip @xcite from the neutral quiescent gas at 4.7@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 to the shock  precursor component at 5.2@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath11 .",
    "neutral velocity drift produces the ejection of material from grains @xcite enhancing the sio , ch@xmath0oh , so , cs , and h@xmath1s abundances by up to a factor of 10 in the shock  precursor component ( fig.@xmath42 ) .",
    "the detection of slightly redshifted emission for these shock tracers toward the l1448mm ( 0,20 ) position ( fig.@xmath41 ) , is also consistent with the kinematical effects expected for the precursor @xcite .",
    "as the gas enters the shock and reaches the shock velocity , the rate of molecules ejected from grain mantles is largely increased , leading to the broadening of the line profiles of sio , ch@xmath0oh , so , and cs toward the l1448mm ( 0,20 ) position ( see fig.@xmath41 ) .",
    "these shock tracers are @xmath10instantaneously@xmath10 enhanced by a factor of @xmath51000 in the postshock gas .",
    "for sio and ch@xmath0oh , this enhancement is consistent with the abundances observed in other outflows ( bachiller & prez gutirrez 1997 ; blake et al .",
    "1987 ) and predicted by chemistry models with injection of material from grains ( flower et al . 1996 ; charnley et al . 1992 ) . however , in the case of the sulfur chemistry , the lack of broad h@xmath1s emission and the fact that the time  scales for h@xmath1s to decrease its abundance to @xmath1810@xmath15 are much larger ( t@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4yr ; charnley 1997 ) than the dynamical age of the outflow , contrast with the general assumption that this molecule is also released from grains ( charnley 1997 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1s abundances derived from the shock  precursor ( @xmath52@xmath1910@xmath21 ) and the postshock ( @xmath1810@xmath15 ) components can not be responsible for the large so and cs abundances ( @xmath510@xmath6 ) observed in the postshock gas .",
    "ocs has been detected on grains ( palumbo , geballe , & tielens 1997 ) , and van der tak et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and martn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have reported large ocs abundances in massive star ",
    "forming regions and in the nucleus of ngc@xmath4253 .",
    "one may consider that ocs could play an important role in the sulfur chemistry of l1448mm .",
    "however , the upper limits to the ocs abundance ( @xmath183@xmath1910@xmath15 ) observed toward l1448mm can not either explain the large so and cs abundances .",
    "the fact that so@xmath1 is also undetected toward this young outflow suggests that ocs and so@xmath1 are late  time products of the sulfur chemistry ( charnley 1997 ) .",
    "finally , wakelam et al . (",
    "2004 ) have recently proposed that the sulfur of grain mantles could be directly released into gas phase in atomic form , or in molecules that would be rapidly converted into it .",
    "recent spitzer observations have shown that s is very abundant toward the young cepheus e outflow ( noriega  crespo et al .",
    "2004 ) . as noted by wakelam et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , s or s@xmath1 may produce large abundances of so by reacting with o@xmath1 or o for t@xmath51001000@xmath4yr .",
    "however , the predicted so@xmath17cs abundance ratio is four orders of magnitude larger than the so@xmath17cs ratio observed in the postshock gas , and o@xmath1 is undetected toward young outflows like ngc@xmath42071 or iras@xmath416293 @xcite .",
    "it is then unlikely that so and cs have been formed by gas phase chemistry from atomic sulfur in the postshock gas of l1448mm .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the amount of so and cs within the grain mantles of l1448mm must be larger than initially thought , suggesting the idea that these molecules could have been generated by gas phase chemistry in the past , and afterwards depleted onto grains ( bergin , melnick , & neufeld 1998 ) .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that so or cs are more abundant than h@xmath1s or ocs in the grain mantles of the l1448mm outflow . in general ,",
    "the chemistry of sulfur  bearing molecules in shocks and hot cores will strongly depend on the `` history '' of the formation of the grain mantles .    in summary , the line profiles and the abundances of the shock tracers measured at the different velocity components in the l1448mm outflow ,",
    "indicate that we have observed the `` finger prints '' of the three stages of the shock evolution : the preshock , the shock  precursor and the postshock gas .",
    "the observed enhancement in the abundance of sio , ch@xmath0oh , so , and cs by one order of magnitude in the shock  precursor component , and by three orders of magnitude in the postshock gas , indicate the recent ejection of these molecules from grains .",
    "the abundances of the proposed sulfur  bearing parents like h@xmath1s and ocs , can not explain the large enhancement of so and cs in the postshock gas .",
    "this suggests a strong dependence of the sulfur chemistry on the chemical evolution of the grain mantle composition .",
    "the lack of ocs and so@xmath1 in l1448mm indicates that these molecules must be late  time products of the sulfur chemistry .",
    "this work has been supported by the spanish mec under projects number aya200210113e , aya200302785e and esp200400665 .",
