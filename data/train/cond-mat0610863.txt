    "recently , a series of observations @xcite in the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin5 at low temperatures and in high fields seem to have clarified that the new high field phase in the parallel field configuration ( @xmath0 ) , surrounded by the discontinuous @xmath1-transition and a continuous transition from the abrikosov vortex lattice , will be a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) vortex lattice .",
    "this fflo state @xcite is expected to have a one - dimensional modulation of the gap function along@xcite @xmath2 through the observation @xcite of a reduction of ultrasound velocity in the new phase , which can be attributed to an additional vortex tilt assisted by an elastic fluctuation of the nodal planes of the fflo structure @xcite .",
    "the presence of the nodal planes seems to be also consistent with the nmr data @xcite .",
    "a more recent nmr measurement @xcite in perpendicular fields ( @xmath3 ) , together with a subtle anomaly in heat capacity data @xcite , has shown features similar to the above - mentioned ones in @xmath4 .",
    "this similarity strongly suggests the presence of a fflo vortex state with a modulation along the @xmath5-axis and the applied field .",
    "however , this fact may be unexpected , because the fermi surface ( fs ) of cecoin5 is roughly cylindrical , and the fflo modulation in the pauli - limited case ( i.e. , with no vortices ) is not expected to develop along a direction with open fs .",
    "we point out here that the presence of a small sheet of three - dimensional ( 3d ) fs can support a fflo modulation parallel to @xmath2 , which is stable with respect to a vortex tilt .",
    "further , the modulation direction of a possible fflo state is found to be reflected in the characters of the @xmath1 and fflo transitions .",
    "our analysis is based on a microscopic derivation of a ginzburg - landau functional and is a straightforward extention @xcite of that in ref.5 , where a 2nd order fflo to abrikosov transition field decreasing upon cooling was first demonstrated .",
    "typical examples of phase diagrams we obtain at this time are shown in fig.1 where @xmath6 denotes the magnetic field normalized by the orbital limiting field . except for the used forms of fs , the material parameters in fig.1 ( a ) and ( b )",
    "are the same as each other .",
    "figure 1(a ) follows from the use of a purely cylindrical fs , in which the in - plane component @xmath7 of the fermi velocity is much larger than @xmath8 everywhere , and , as in the pauli - limited case , the fflo modulation tends to be formed along the ab - plane everywhere in the phase diagram . due to the landau - level ( ll ) structure of the pair - field in the presence of vortices ,",
    "however , a two - fold symmetric structure due to the nodal planes parallel to @xmath2 is not described in the lowest ll ( @xmath9 ) but rather in the next ll ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the nodal planes can be regarded as being accommodated as periodic stripes in the @xmath10 vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "that is , a fflo state modulating not along @xmath2 but in a perpendicular direction to @xmath2 may occur at low enough temperature ( @xmath11 ) in fig.1(a ) .",
    "however , the normal to n=1 vortex lattice transition , occurring on the thick dashed line below @xmath12 , is of 2nd order .    [ 0.45 ] v.s .",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) phase diagrams in @xmath3 resulting ( a ) from the purely cylindrical fs and ( b ) from a cylindrical one with 3d - like portions ( see the dotted lines in the inset ) .",
    "below @xmath15 , the @xmath1-transition occurs on each thick solid curve and is discontinuous , while each dotted curve is the 2nd order @xmath1-transition curve and its extrapolation .",
    "the thin solid curve in ( b ) is the 2nd order transition line between the abrikosov vortex lattice and the fflo one with modulation @xmath16 . in both figures ,",
    "the maki parameter is 1.0.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ 0.45 ] v.s .",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) phase diagrams in @xmath3 resulting ( a ) from the purely cylindrical fs and ( b ) from a cylindrical one with 3d - like portions ( see the dotted lines in the inset ) .",
    "below @xmath15 , the @xmath1-transition occurs on each thick solid curve and is discontinuous , while each dotted curve is the 2nd order @xmath1-transition curve and its extrapolation .",
    "the thin solid curve in ( b ) is the 2nd order transition line between the abrikosov vortex lattice and the fflo one with modulation @xmath16 . in both figures ,",
    "the maki parameter is 1.0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , in fig.1(b ) where a cylindrical fs with small 3d - like branches ( the dashed lines in the inset ) was used , we have a 2nd order transition between the abrikosov vortex lattice and a fflo one modulating along @xmath2 and with nodal planes perpendicular to @xmath2 in much higher temperatures than the region dominated by the @xmath10 ll .",
    "this fs in fig.1(b ) simulates that expressed by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands @xcite of the fss of cecoin5 .",
    "as observed @xcite in cecoin5 , the transition from the normal to this fflo state is discontinuous @xcite , while the fflo to abrikosov transition is of 2nd order .",
    "notice , by comparing both the figures with each other , that the directions of modulation in fflo states correlate with the characters of the transitions surrounding the fflo state _ when the vortices are present_.",
    "several remarks are needed to compare fig.1(b ) with the experimental phase diagram @xcite . first , although the fflo state with nodal planes @xmath16 inevitably appears at the lowest temperatures where the @xmath1-transition is of 2nd order , a small amount of impurities play the role of shifting various temperature scales to lower temperatures @xcite so that the @xmath10 ll state is lost in real systems .",
    "second , the experimental 2nd order abrikosov to fflo transition line is flat and insensitive @xcite to @xmath13 in contrast to that in fig.1(b ) .",
    "however , we find @xcite that a flat fflo transition curve is obtained by slightly reducing the 3d portion of fs or by incorporating the antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuation because an af fluctuation , weaker with increasing @xmath6 , competes with the pauli paramagnetic effect .",
    "further , we note that the fflo state modulating along @xmath2 in @xmath3 is more stable than that in @xmath4 . in the latter ,",
    "the nodal plane becomes softer with increasing @xmath6 or the material anisotropy , and a reduction @xcite of tilt modulus occurs in the fflo state , while the tilt modulus in the fflo state in the former rather increases upon cooling @xcite .",
    "ultrasound experiments in @xmath3 are useful for checking the validity of the present theory .",
