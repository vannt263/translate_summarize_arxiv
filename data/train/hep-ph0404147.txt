    "the spin structure of the pomeron was analysed by different authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "such spin effects which do not vanish at high energies might be determined by the large distance contributions in the hadron structure which lead to a complicated spin - dependent form of the pomeron ",

    "the gluon - loop corrections to the pomeron coupling with the hadron might produce other sources of the spin - flip part in this coupling @xcite .",
    "manifestation of spin - dependent pomeron can be investigated in the elastic pp scattering at low @xmath3 @xcite , near diffraction minimum @xcite and in polarized diffractive hadron leptoproduction @xcite .",
    "spin effects in diffractive processes at small @xmath0 should be studied at accelerators with polarized beams .",
    "the pomeron in qcd is related with a two - qluon colorless exchange @xcite , and in polarized experiments the spin - dependent two - gluon coupling with the proton can be analyzed . in diffractive hadron photoproduction",
    "the momentum carried by the two - gluon system is usually not equal to zero . in this case",
    ", the two - gluon coupling with the proton might be expressed in terms of the generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent gluon distributions contain significant information on the spin structure of the proton . the important role in investigation of polarized gluon gpd",
    "should play the diffractive @xmath1 leptoproduction at small @xmath0 .",
    "information on this process can be obtained from dijet events in lepton - proton interaction .",
    "theoretical analysis of these reactions was carried out in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the cross sections of diffractive quark- antiquark production are expressed in terms of the same gluon distributions as in the case of vector meson production .",
    "thus , the diffractive @xmath1 leptoproduction at small @xmath0 really might be an excellent tool that can be used to study the gluon gpd at small @xmath0 .",
    "spin effects in @xmath1 production in lepton - proton reaction at small @xmath4 , where the gluon contribution prevails , was studied , for example in @xcite .",
    "the double spin @xmath2 asymmetries in @xmath1 production for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized proton were analysed within the two- gluon exchange model .",
    "the predicted @xmath2 asymmetry is not small and is sensitive to the spin - dependent part of the two - gluon coupling with the proton .    in future",
    "one of the best places to study spin effects in diffractive lepton - proton reactions will be the erhic accelerator @xcite with a polarized lepton beam which will collide with the rhic beam .",

    "such a kinematics is similar to the hera accelerator and is suitable to study hard diffractive events .",

    ", we discuss a possibility to study @xmath2 asymmetry in diffractive @xmath1 production in future experiments at erhic in order to receive information on the polarized gluon distributions ( preliminary results can be found in @xcite ) . in the second section ,",
    "we analyse the kinematics of the final particle in this reaction .",
    "it is shown that the final proton moves practically in the same direction as the initial one .",
    "jets from the final quarks have large angles and should be analysed by the erhic detector . in the third section ,",
    "the main theoretical equations which determine the spin asymmetry in @xmath1 production are presented .",

    "let us study the diffractive quark initiated dijet production in lepton - proton reactions @xmath5 at high energies in a lepton - proton system .",
    "the hadronic state @xmath6 contains two diffractively produced quarks which are observed as two final jets .    the graphs with @xmath3-channel gluon exchange in diffractive @xmath7 leptoproduction are shown in fig .",
    "1 . this contribution predominates at small @xmath8 for light quark and essential for heavy ( charm ) quark production , because the charm component in the proton is small .",
    "the reaction ( [ react ] ) is described in terms of the kinematic variables which are defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the initial and final lepton and proton momenta , respectively , @xmath12 is the photon virtuality , @xmath13 is the momentum carried by the pomeron , @xmath3 is a momentum transfer squared and @xmath0 is a bjorken variable . in ( [ momen ] )",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the fractions of the longitudinal momenta of the lepton and proton carried by the photon and pomeron , respectively .",
    "the energy of the lepton  proton system reads as @xmath16 .",
    "the effective mass of a produced quark system is equal to @xmath17 and can be large .",

    "the energy in the lepton - proton system is @xmath41 and for our choice the minimum and maximum energy for erhic will be @xmath42 and @xmath43 . to estimate the kinematics of the final particles at erhic , we use some typical values of the variables determined in ( [ momen ] ) : @xmath44 and @xmath45 is small . in this case",
    ", the final lepton momentum and angle can be estimated for @xmath37 as @xmath46 for @xmath38 we find @xmath47 the kinematics of the final hadron production for energies @xmath42 and @xmath43 is shown in the table .",

    "light quark case    we can see from the table that the final proton is going inside the cone with angle @xmath52 .",
    "it moves practically in the same direction as the initial proton and it is possibly difficult to detect it .",
    "it is shown in the table that the final quarks have large angles @xmath53 .",
    "thus the final proton and jet angles are very different and final jets should be detected by the erhic .",
    "to study spin effects in diffractive hadron production , one must know the structure of the two - gluon coupling with the proton at small @xmath0 .",
    "the two - gluon coupling with the proton which describes transverse spin effects in the proton can be parametrized in the form @xcite @xmath54 here @xmath24 is the proton mass . in the matrix structure ( [ ver ] ) we wrote only the terms with the maximal powers of a large proton momentum @xmath55 which are symmetric in the gluon indices @xmath56 .",
    "the structure proportional to @xmath57 determines the spin - non - flip contribution .",
    "the term @xmath58 leads to the transverse spin - flip at the vertex .",
    "these distribution functions should be connected with @xmath59 , @xmath60 which describe the spin - average and transverse spin distributions , respectively .",
    "if one considers the longitudinal spin effects , the asymmetric structure @xmath61 should be included in ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "there are some models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) that provide spin - flip effects which do not vanish at high energies .",
    "the models @xcite describe the experimental data on single spin transverse asymmetry @xmath62 @xcite quite well .",
    "the spin asymmetries in @xmath63 scattering at rhic energies ( pp2pp experiment ) were predicted to be not small @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was made that the weak energy dependence of spin asymmetries in exclusive reactions is not now in contradiction with experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath64 might have a weak @xmath0 -dependence and be about @xmath65 , as was found in @xcite .",
    "this value will be used here in estimations of the asymmetry in diffractive @xmath1 production .",
    "the spin - average and spin dependent cross sections with longitudinal polarization of a lepton and a transverse proton polarization are determined by @xmath66 to calculate the cross sections , we integrate the amplitudes squared over the @xmath1 phase space .",
    "the cross section of diffractive processes are expressed in terms of the soft gluon coupling ( [ ver ] ) , which is convoluted with the hard hadron production amplitude . the spin - average and spin - dependent cross section can be written in the form @xmath67 here @xmath68 is a normalization function which is common for the spin average and spin dependent cross section , and @xmath69 is determined by a sum of graphs integrated over the gluon momenta .    the @xmath70 function , which determines the spin - average cross section , can be written as @xmath71 the function @xmath72 has a complicated form and was calculated numerically .",
    "the details of calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cross section ( [ sigma],[np ] ) is expressed in terms of the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 integrated over the gluon momentum @xmath75 where @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the connection with the gluon gpd @xcite is achieved in equations ( [ bqq ] ) .",
    "this shows that the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the nonintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section is determined by the interference between spin - average and spin - dependence distributions .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the @xmath79 function in ( [ sigma ] ) contains two terms which are proportional to the scalar production @xmath80 and to @xmath81 where @xmath82 is transverse polarization of the proton @xmath83.\\ ] ] the contributions of these terms to the asymmetry can be analysed independently .",
    "really , if one does not consider the azimuthal jets kinematics and integrate over @xmath48 , only the term proportional to @xmath80 will contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "the spin - average cross section of the vector meson production at small momentum transfer is approximately proportional to the @xmath84 function ( [ np ] ) which is connected with the generalized gluon distribution @xmath85 .",
    "we use here the simple parameterization of the gpd as a product of the @xmath3-dependent form factor and the ordinary gluon distribution @xmath86 a more general form of gpd ( see e.g. @xcite ) can be analysed .",
    "however , some enhancement factor which appears in this case will be mainly canceled in the asymmetry .",
    "the form factor @xmath87 in ( [ b_g ] ) is chosen as an electromagnetic form factor of the proton .",
    "such a simple choice can be justified by the fact that the pomeron ",
    "proton vertex might be similar to the photon ",
    "proton coupling @xcite @xmath88    the energy dependence of the cross sections at small @xmath0 is determined by the pomeron contribution to the gluon distribution function @xmath89 here @xmath90 is a pomeron trajectory which has the form @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these values are in accordance with the fit of the diffractive @xmath94 production by zeus @xcite . for @xmath95",
    "the ordinary gluon distribution can be approximated at small @xmath0 by @xcite @xmath96    the @xmath2 asymmetry of hadron production is determined as a ratio of spin - dependent and spin - average cross sections ( [ sigma],[np],[nm ] ) @xmath97 it can be seen that at small momentum transfer the asymmetry is approximately proportional to the ratio of polarized and spin  average gluon distribution functions @xmath98 in estimations of asymmetry we shall use the same ratio of spin - dependent and spin - average gluon structures , as in the case of elastic scattering @xmath99 for simplicity .",
    "this means that in this case the coefficient @xmath100 in ( [ cltqq ] ) is equal to @xmath101 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath81 in the asymmetry ( @xmath102 ) will be analyzed for the case when the transverse jet momentum @xmath103 is parallel to the target polarization @xmath104 .",
    "the asymmetry is maximal in this case . to observe this contribution to asymmetry",
    ", it is necessary to distinguish experimentally the quark and antiquark jets .",
    "this can be realized presumably by analyses of charge of the leading particles in the jet which should be connected with the charge of quark produced in the process .",
    "if one does not separate events with @xmath103 which is parallel to @xmath104 for the quark jet , e.g. , the resulting asymmetry will be zero because the transverse momentum of the quark and antiquark are equal and opposite in sign .    the predicted asymmetry @xcite for light quark production at energy @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "the asymmetry for heavy @xmath106 production is approximately of the same order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ kt_h ] ) .",
    "the model used for the ratio of gluon distribution ( [ ratio ] ) leads to the weak energy dependence of asymmetry . as a result",
    ", the asymmetry for @xmath107 should be practically the same .",
    "the predicted asymmetries are not small , about 5 - 10 % .",
    "this shows a possibility of studying the polarized gluon distribution @xmath108 in a future erhic experiment .",
    "the contribution to @xmath109 asymmetry which is proportional to @xmath110 is analyzed for the case when the transverse jet momentum @xmath111 is parallel to the target polarization @xmath104 ( a maximal contribution to the asymmetry ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath109 asymmetry in diffractive light @xmath1 production at @xmath112 is shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding results for heavy quarks is presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath109 asymmetry has a visible mass dependence . for light quark production , asymmetry is not small",
    ". for @xmath113 it changes the sign at @xmath114 . for heavy quark production",
    "the predicted asymmetry is negative and not small , too .",
    "note that in most experiments it is difficult to detect the final hadron ( see section 2 ) and correspondingly to determine the hadron momentum transfer . in this case",
    ", it is useful to have predictions for the asymmetry integrated over momentum transfer @xmath115 we integrate cross sections from @xmath116 up to @xmath117 .",
    "the predicted integrated asymmetry for light quarks is shown in fig [ iqt_l ] .",
    "it is not small , about 1 - 2% for @xmath118 . as the nonintegrated asymmetry , the integrated one changes the sign near @xmath119 .",
    "the diffractive @xmath1 leptoproduction at small @xmath0 which is predominant by the gluon exchange was analysed at erhic energies within the two - gluon spin - dependent exchange model .",
    "the spin asymmetry is found to be proportional to the ratio of polarized gluon gpd @xmath120    the information about @xmath121 can be obtained from asymmetry if the coefficient @xmath122 in ( [ asylt1 ] ) is not small .",
    "the @xmath2 asymmetry of diffractive @xmath1 production contains two terms which are proportional to @xmath123 and to @xmath80 ( [ nm ] ) .",
    "these terms in the asymmetry have different kinematic properties and can be studied independently .",
    "the term @xmath124 has a large coefficient @xmath125 that is predicted to be about 0.3 - 0.5 .",
    "our results for asymmetry of light and heavy quark production in this case is quite similar .",
    "we can conclude that this term in the asymmetry might be an excellent tool to study transverse effects in the proton gluon coupling .",
    "however , the experimental study of this asymmetry is not so simple . to find nonzero asymmetry in this case ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish quark and antiquark jets and to have a possibility to analyse the azimuthal event structure over the transverse jet momentum .",
    "the expected @xmath2 asymmetry for the term @xmath126 is not small , too .",
    "the predicted coefficient @xmath127 in this case is about 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "this asymmetry is expected to be quite different for light and heavy quark production .",
    "the asymmetry found in the model is about 24% for @xmath128 and @xmath113 and has a different sign for light and heavy quark production .",
    "thus , our estimations show that the corresponding coefficient @xmath122 in different terms of the @xmath2 asymmetry might not be small .",
    "it should be possibile to study @xmath2 asymmetry in a future erhic experiment for a transversely polarized proton where the important information on the polarized gluon gpd can be obtained .",
