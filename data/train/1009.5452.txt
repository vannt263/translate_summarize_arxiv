    "at high excitation energies , the colliding nuclei may break into several small and intermediate size fragments and a large number of nucleons are also emitted @xcite . the emission of intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) in nuclear collisions",
    "was studied for more than a decade during which several experimental groups have carried out a complete study of fragment formation with 4@xmath15 detectors @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that the fragments formed in heavy - ion collisions depend crucially on the bombarding energy and impact parameter of the reaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , these experimental studies of fragmentation offer a unique opportunity to explore the mechanism behind the formation of the fragments .",
    "moreover , one can also pin down the role of dynamics in fragment formation and its time scale .    recently",
    ", there has been increasing interest in the effects of reaction dynamics on the production of imfs and light charged particles ( lcps , @xmath16 = 1 or 2 ) .",
    "sisan @xmath17 @xcite studied the emission of imfs from central collisions of nearly symmetric systems using a 4@xmath15-array set up , where they found that the multiplicity of imfs shows a rise and fall with increase in the beam energy .",
    "they observed that e@xmath12 ( the energy at which the maximum production of imfs occurs ) increases linearly with the system mass , whereas a power - law ( @xmath18 a@xmath19 ) dependence was reported for peak multiplicity of imfs with power factor @xmath13 = 0.7 .",
    "peaslee @xmath17 @xcite , however , studied the asymmetric system @xmath20kr+@xmath8au in the incident energy range from 35 to 400 mev / nucleon and obtained an energy dependence of multifragmentation .",
    "their findings revealed that fragment production increases up to 100 mev / nucleon and then decreases with increase in incident energy .",
    "de souza @xmath17 @xcite studied the central collisions of @xmath21ar+@xmath8au from 35 to 120 mev / nucleon and observed that imf multiplicity shows a steady increase with increase in the incident energy .",
    "the imf multiplicity decreases , however , when one moves from central to peripheral collisions . however , tsang @xmath17 @xcite , in their investigation of @xmath8au+@xmath8au collisions at e / a = 100 , 250 , and 400 mev , found the occurrence of peak multiplicity at lower energies for central collisions whereas it is shifted to higher energies for peripheral collisions .",
    "@xcite used a nearly symmetric system of @xmath4kr+@xmath5nb from 35 to 95 mev / nucleon to obtain imf multiplicity distribution as a function of beam energy by selecting central events .",
    "ogilvie @xmath22 @xcite also studied the multifragment decays of au projectiles after collisions with c , al , and cu targets at the bombarding energy of 600 mev / nucleon using the aladin forward spectrometer at gsi , darmstadt , with the beam accelerated by schwerionensynchrotron ( sis ) .",
    "they found that , with increasing violence of collision , the mean multiplicity of imfs originating from the projectile first increases to a maximum and then decreases again .",
    "as mentioned earlier , sisan @xmath17 @xcite reported that the peak multiplicity of imfs as well as peak center - of - mass energy scale with the size of the system . in a recent communication , vermani and puri @xcite succeeded partially in explaining the above - mentioned behavior by using the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) approach . here",
    "we plan to extend the above study by incorporating various model ingredients such as equation of state , nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross section , and gaussian width .",
    "the role of different clusterization algorithms is also explored .",
    "we attempt to find out whether these ingredients have sizable effects .",
    "we describe the time evolution of a heavy - ion reaction within the framework of a qmd model @xcite , which is based on a molecular dynamics picture . here each nucleon is represented by a coherent state of the form @xmath23 thus , the wave function has two time - dependent parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the total @xmath26-body wave function is assumed to be a direct product of coherent states : @xmath27 where antisymmetrization is neglected .",
    "one should , however , keep in the mind that the pauli principle , which is very important at low incident energies , was taken into account .",
    "the initial values of the parameters are chosen in a way that the ensemble ( @xmath28+@xmath29 ) nucleons give a proper density distribution as well as a proper momentum distribution of the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "the time evolution of the system is calculated using the generalized variational principle .",
    "we start out from the action @xmath30 d\\tau , \\label { e3}\\ ] ] with the lagrange functional @xmath31 where the total time derivative includes the derivatives with respect to the parameters .",
    "the time evolution is obtained by the requirement that the action is stationary under the allowed variation of the wave function @xmath32 dt=0 . \\label{e5}\\ ] ] if the true solution of the schrdinger equation is contained in the restricted set of wave function @xmath33 this variation of the action gives the exact solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "if the parameter space is too restricted , we obtain that wave function in the restricted parameter space , which comes close to the solution of the schrdinger equation . performing the variation with the test wave function ( 2 ) , we obtain for each parameter",

    "1(a ) , we display the model calculations using hard@xmath86 ( solid line ) and soft@xmath86 ( dashed line ) . from fig .",
    "1(a ) , we see that the number of imfs is larger in case of soft compared to that of hard . this is because of the fact that soft matter is easily compressed , resulting in greater achieved density , which in turn leads to the large number of imfs compared to that in the hard .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the effect could be opposite at higher energies , because at higher energies the imfs may further break into lcps and free nucleons . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we display the results for hard@xmath86 and hard@xmath87 ( dotted line ) . as evident from the fig .",
    "1(b ) , the number of imfs is nearly same for both types of cross sections .",
    "this may be because , for the central collisions , since the excitation energy is already high , different cross sections have a negligible role to play . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we display the results for the hard case along with two different widths of the gaussian , that is , l and l@xmath83 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "we find that the width of gaussian has a considerable impact on fragmentation .",
    "as we change the gaussian width ( l ) from 4.33 to 8.66 @xmath82 , the multiplicity of imfs is reduced by @xmath88 30@xmath89 .",
    "interestingly , the kaon yield also gets reduced by the same amount @xcite . owing to its large interaction range",
    ", an extended wave packet ( i.e. l@xmath83 ) connects a large number of nucleons in a fragment , as a result , it generates heavier fragments compared to what is obtained with a smaller width .",

    "1(d ) , we display the results using hard and hmd ( dash - dot - dotted line ) . again",
    "the number of imfs are nearly same for both equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "this is expected because the effect of mdi is small at these energies .",
    "however , the scenario is completely different at high energies ; at high energies , owing to the repulsive nature of mdi , there is a large destruction of initial correlations and the additional momentum dependence further destroys the correlations reducing further the multiplicity of imfs .",
    "this leads to the emission of lots of nucleons and lcps @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 , we display the average multiplicity of imfs , @xmath10n@xmath84 , as a function of incident energy in the center - of - mass frame ( e@xmath85 ) for the @xmath4kr+@xmath5nb reaction employing the mst ( open symbols ) and the mstb ( solid symbols ) methods . figures .",

    "the number of imfs first increases with incident energy , attains a maximum , and then decreases , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath10n@xmath84 is greater for the mst method than for mstb , because in the case of the mstb , along with spatial correlations , an additional check for binding energy is also used ; therefore , it filters out the loosely bound fragments which decay later .",
    "hence , the fragments obtained with the mstb are properly bound .",
    "a similar trend is obtained for all other reactions as well as different model ingredients used in the present study but is less pronounced in lighter systems like @xmath0ne+@xmath0ne and @xmath1ar+@xmath2sc as compared to heavier systems . however , for the gaussian width l@xmath83",
    ", the value of @xmath10n@xmath84 is nearly zero in this incident energy range using the mstb ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is because an extended wave packet ( i.e. l@xmath83 ) connects a large number of nucleons in a fragment ; as a result , it generates heavier fragments and the additional binding energy check further excludes the unbound fragments .    in fig .",

    "3 , the model calculations are also compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that model calculations for e@xmath9 agree with experimental data @xcite whereas in the case of @xmath10n@xmath11 , as the system mass increases , the difference between model calculations and experimental results continues to increase .",
    "this behavior is consistent for all the different choices of model ingredients .",
    "this may be because the fragments obtained with the mst method are not reliable because this method makes sense only when matter is diluted and well separated .",
    "this is true only in the case of high beam energy and in central collisions .",
    "therefore , we have to look for other methods of clusterization . as mentioned earlier , the fragments obtained with the mstb are properly bound and reliable .",
