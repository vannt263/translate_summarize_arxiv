    "recently the annihilation of the low energy positrons on collision with various gas molecules has been studied systematically by surko and his collaborators  @xcite .",
    "they have measured the annihilation rate , @xmath6 , of the thermalized positron and estimated the positron annihilation parameter , @xmath7 , defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the classical electron radius , @xmath10 is the speed of light , and @xmath11 is the number density of the molecules .",
    "the @xmath7 has been revealed to be very sensitive to small changes in the molecular structure and increasing parametrically from 1 to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "a parameter similar to @xmath7 is defined for the case of the positronium(ps ) annihilation in gases .",
    "it is related to the pickoff quenching of the ortho - positronium(o - ps ) and called @xmath3 .",
    "this parameter represents the effective number of the electrons per molecule in a spin singlet state relative to the positron in the o - ps  @xcite .",
    "the pickoff quenching rate is expressed as @xmath13 the values of @xmath3 for various gases reported so far are collected in ref .",
    "@xcite . they lie , except for @xmath2 , between 0.1 and 1.3 , very small in contrast to @xmath7 .    in a paramagnetic gas such as @xmath2",
    ", o - ps can be also quenched by spin - conversion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the conversion of o - ps into para - positronium(p - ps ) followed by its prompt self - annihilation  @xcite .",
    "there exists two kinds of ps spin - conversion processes in @xmath2 .",
    "one excites the @xmath2 molecule to the excited state @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , and thus may be called inelastic conversion .",
    "this process is active when the energy of the ps is larger than @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "the other leaves the @xmath2 molecule in the ground state @xmath18 and may be called elastic conversion .",
    "the latter process has no threshold and thus active for the thermalized o - ps .",
    "these two spin - conversions have quite different cross - sections  @xcite ; the cross - section for the former is on the order of @xmath19 , and that for the latter is on the order of @xmath20  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quenching rate of o - ps in @xmath2 including the effect of the spin - conversion is expressed in terms of @xmath3 as @xmath21 .",
    "the proper @xmath3 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1zeff ] ) is not known . in order to measure this , the pickoff quenching has to be separated from the spin - conversion .    in the present work ,",
    "we obtain the @xmath3 and the spin - conversion cross - section for @xmath2 by positron annihilation age - momentum correlation technique(amoc ) .",
    "the amoc consists in a correlated measurement of the positron lifetime and the energy of the annihilation @xmath1-rays .",
    "the doppler broadening spectrum of the 511 @xmath0 @xmath1-rays from the 2@xmath1 annihilation of the o - ps in @xmath2 has been measured as a function of the time that the o - ps atoms have spent from their formation to annihilation .",
    "the 2@xmath1 annihilation in the time range in which only o - ps exists results either from the pickoff quenching or from the self - annihilation of the p - ps created through the spin - conversion .",
    "the @xmath3 and the spin - conversion cross - section are determined by separating the pickoff quenching from the spin - conversion .",
    "preliminary results with a different setup were reported in ref .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a 0.5 @xmath22 @xmath23 positron source was sandwiched between two sheets of 100 @xmath24 thick plastic scintillator .",
    "the source - scintillator assembly was placed between two pieces of 1 @xmath25 thick @xmath26 aerogel , which was used as ps formation medium  @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic density and the averaged grain diameter of the @xmath26 aerogel are 0.1 @xmath27 and about 5 @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "most of the positrons from the source pass through the scintillators and give scintillation lights .",
    "the lights pass through the transparent @xmath26 aerogel and are directed to a photomultiplier tube(pmt ) by a light guide .",
    "a @xmath1-ray emitted when a positron annihilates was detected by a high purity ge detector .",
    "the output of the ge detector was fed to a timing - filter - amplifier(tfa ) .",
    "the time interval between the anode signal of the pmt and the output of the tfa was converted into an peak amplitude of an output pulse by a time - to - amplitude converter(tac ) and used for the lifetime spectroscopy .",
    "the other output of the ge detector was processed by a shaping amplifier and the peak hight was recorded for the energy information .",
    "the observed energy region was limited in the neighborhood of the 511 @xmath0 peak by a biased amplifier .",
    "all the data were stored in the list mode .",
    "a 2 @xmath29 thick @xmath30 sheet was placed in front of the ge detector to prevent low energy scattered @xmath1-rays from simultaneously hitting the ge detector .",
    "the time resolution was 4.8 @xmath31(fwhm ) , and the energy resolution was 1.12 @xmath0(fwhm ) at 512 @xmath0(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the chamber was filled with @xmath2 of purity 99.9995@xmath33 to 1.05 @xmath34 after evacuating it with a turbo molecular pump , and then isolated from the rest of the gas handling system .",
    "the measurement lasted for 16 hours . during the measurement ,",
    "the room temperature was controlled to be @xmath35 . for data analysis ,",
    "a measurement without a gas was also made for 16 hours .",
    "to 516 @xmath0 .",
    "the closed circles show the time interval distribution between a positron emission and the eventual annihilation .",
    "the closed triangles show the fittd @xmath36 as a function of the start point of the fit .",
    "the energy spectra of the @xmath37-rays in the time windows ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . ]    the closed circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] show the positron lifetime spectrum for the energy range from 500 @xmath0 to 516 @xmath0 .",
    "the prompt peak is followed by the slow decay curve and subsequently the flat background .",
    "the prompt peak arises from the positron annihilations without ps formation as well as the self - annihilations of p - ps .",
    "the slow decay part originates from the o - ps annihilations .",
    "the total annihilation rate of the o - ps , @xmath38 , is obtained from the slow decay part .",
    "it is the sum of the self - annihilation rate , @xmath39 , and the annihilation rates for three different collisional quenching modes ; @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the rate of the pickoff quenching on the grain surface , @xmath42 is that on the @xmath2 molecule , and @xmath43 is the rate of the spin - conversion on the @xmath2 molecule .",
    "the latter two collisional quenching rates are propotional to the number density of the @xmath2 molecules , @xmath11 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the quenching cross - section and @xmath46 is the speed of the ps .",
    "the speed of the o - ps relative to the target molecule has been replaced by @xmath46 , neglecting the relatively small velocity of the molecules .",
    "the initial kinetic energy of the ps depends on whether it is formed inside a @xmath26 grain or on a grain surface  @xcite .",
    "the ps formed and thermalized inside a @xmath26 grain escapes into the free space between the grains with the kinetic energy of 1 @xmath47 determined by the negative work function for the ps . on the other hand ,",
    "the ps formed on the surfaces of the grains is emmitted with the kinetic energy of 3 @xmath47 .",
    "it penetrates shallowly back into another grain and thermalizes , and reemitted with the kinetic energy of 1 @xmath47 .",
    "once the ps energy reaches 1 @xmath47 , it does not enter another grain any more .",
    "then the energy loss of the ps becomes much slower  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the time dependence of the collisional quenching rates , resulting in time dependence of the total annihilation rate @xmath38 and subtle and complicated shape of the o - ps time spectrum .",
    "the time spectrum can not be represented as a simple exponential decay before the o - ps is thermalized . denoting the survival probability of the o - ps up to time t by @xmath48 , the time spectrum is given by @xmath49 d(t ) + c\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the absolute detection efficiencies for the @xmath1-rays from the 3@xmath1 annihilations and the 2@xmath1 annihilations , respectively , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants .    in order to determine the total annihilation rate @xmath38 for the themalized o - ps , we fit the lifetime spectrum(fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) to a function a @xmath54 + b , where a and b are constants , and the parameter @xmath36 is obtained as the start time of the fit @xmath55 is stepped out .",
    "the results are plotted by triangles as a function of the start time of the fit in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the fitted @xmath36 gradually decreases , indicating the o - ps slowing down process , and then becomes flat , indicating that the o - ps is thermalized .",
    "once the o - ps is thermalized , the fitted @xmath36 represents the total annihilation rate of the o - ps averaged over the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution at the measuring temperature .",
    "the @xmath38 for the thermalized o - ps is determined from the value in the region where the fitted values are statistically consistent .",
    "we choose @xmath56 to yield @xmath57 where the quenching rates for the thermalized o - ps are represented with the superscript @xmath58 .",
    "the value for @xmath59 is determined similarly from the measurement without a gas , to be @xmath60 by using @xmath61  @xcite , the values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are determined to be , @xmath64    -rays(closed circles ) for 1 @xmath34 of @xmath2 with the time range from 71 @xmath65 to 150 @xmath65 . the background has been subtracted .",
    "the open circles show the o - ps self - annihilation component . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows an example of the time - selected energy spectrum for 1 @xmath34 of @xmath2 measured by the amoc .",
    "the intensity and the shape of the background spectrum have been estimated from the energy spectrum in the time range from 400 @xmath31 to 700 @xmath31 and subtracted .",

    "the dashed curves show the broad component .",
    "the width of this component was fixed to that of the pickoff component for @xmath26 aerogel only , because the change in the width due to the presence of @xmath2 molecules was not appreciable@xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and ( b ) include the components which contributes to the prompt peak ; _ i.e. _ , those from the annihilations of the non - ps positrons and p - ps .",
