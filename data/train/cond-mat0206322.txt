    "although the coexistence of quasiparticles and collective excitations in an interacting system is well known , our knowledge of their properties and mutual interactions in real materials is far from being complete .",
    "one of the most successful approaches to the calculation of the quasiparticle ( qp ) band structure for a wide range of materials is the gw method  @xcite . starting from a non  interacting representation of the system ,",

    "collective modes , i.e. plasmons , occur at energies for which the real part of the dielectric function vanishes with a corresponding small imaginary part ; they can be observed experimentally as sharp peaks in electron energy loss spectra ( eels ) . a well established technique to calculate eel spectra uses the single particle or random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the polarization function , obtained in terms of ab ",
    "initio energy bands .",
    "the latter can be calculated within the kohn sham ( ks )  @xcite formulation of density functional theory  @xcite in the local density approximation  @xcite ( dft  lda ) or in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite , when the exchange  correlation potential @xmath2 is considered as an approximation to the self  energy operator @xmath3 .",
    "this approach completely neglects self  energy corrections , that is the difference @xmath4 , and excitonic effects , whose inclusion has been faced only recently . in the case of silicon , olevano and reining",
    "@xcite showed that using the quasiparticle energy bands without including excitonic effects the shape of the plasmon peak worsens with respect to the experiment .",
    "inclusion of self  energy corrections and excitonic effects yields a spectrum very similar to dft ",

    "many - body effects ( quasiparticle corrections and/or excitonic effects ) are not required to describe correctly the experimental data .",
    "these results agree with the general feeling that excitonic effects partially cancel self  energy corrections .",
    "a similar result has been found for cu  @xcite , where the rpa response function calculated without many - body corrections yields good agreement with the experimental eel and optical spectra .    in this framework",

    "the residual discrepancies between the position of the gw bands and the experimental results ( @xmath90.2ev ) is larger than in the case of copper  @xcite ( @xmath90.05ev ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the qp renormalization of the fermi level in silver ( @xmath90.6ev ) , not present in copper , which yield the large qp corrections reported in table  [ tab1 ] and an additional error . differently from semiconductors , gw corrections",

    "gw optical - transition energies are generally above the dashed - line , representing the condition of vanishing quasiparticle corrections @xmath23 , and lead to upward shifts of the electron  hole energies .",
    "however between @xmath24 and @xmath25ev some electron  hole energy shifts are negative .",

    ", gw shifts the dft  lda spectrum toward _ lower _ energies . in conclusion ,",
    "weak interband transitions start at the threshold in panel(b ) ( @xmath28ev ) , while the main onset of @xmath26 is that of panel(a ) , @xmath27ev .",
    "the resulting ( total ) dielectric function is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the two different effects of gw corrections on @xmath26 shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "are crucial in determining the properties of the plasmon resonance whose frequency , @xmath29 , is defined through the relation @xmath30 @xmath29 is , in general , complex since decay into electron ",
    "hole pairs gives to the plasmon a width proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "now , the sharp onset of @xmath26 at @xmath27ev ( see inset of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) is responsible for a solution of eq.([eq4 ] ) at @xmath32ev , just below the main interband threshold . within dft  lda , instead , the interband threshold of @xmath26 at @xmath33ev remains below @xmath29 , resulting in a strongly damped plasmon peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( dashed line ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , panel(b ) , we see that the only transitions contributing to the plasmon width , proportional to @xmath31 , are those from the fermi surface to the first conduction band at the l point .",
    "these decay channels are in agreement with many experimental results  @xcite that , using temperature and alloying techniques , have singled out the electron  hole transitions responsible for the plasmon damping .",
    "gw - corrected eels is compared with dft  lda and experimental results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : the plasmon peak , underestimated in intensity and position in dft ",
    "lda , is shifted toward higher energies and strongly enhanced by gw corrections , in striking agreement with experiment . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] an overestimation of the absorption spectrum with respect to the experiment is observed ( similar to that found in cu  @xcite ) .",
    "this is reflected in an underestimation of the loss intensity close to @xmath34ev , and might be due to the neglection of qp renormalization factors in eq.([eq2 ] ) and to excitonic dynamical effects  @xcite . despite this partial agreement in the @xmath34ev region , the present _ ab  initio _ gw calculation is able to reproduce correctly the plasmon resonance .",
    "this resonance can be interpreted as a collective ( drude like ) motion of electrons in the partially filled band . however , according to eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , @xmath35 does not coincide with the bare drude frequency @xmath36 , the difference arising from the screening of the electron - electron interaction by virtual interband transitions . the plasmon resonance , although blueshifted with respect to dft  lda , remains _ below _ the main interband threshold , but overlaps the weak low  energy tail of interband transitions ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] , frame(b ) ) acquiring a small yet finite width .",
    "the highly non  trivial qp shifts of interband transitions are crucial to obtain this result .",
    "the polarization of the `` medium '' where the plasmon oscillates ( the _ d _ electrons ) is hence important to determine its energy and width .",
    "this polarization is absent in the homogeneous electron gas because there are no localized _ d _ orbitals and no interband transitions ; it is weak in semiconductors ( like si ) , because interband transitions occur at energies far from that of the plasma resonance .",
    "the same polarization effect is present , but destructive in copper due to the lower onset of interband transitions .",
    "eels peaks occur _ above _ this onset and are therefore strongly broadened . in conclusion , the delicate interplay of plasmon  frequency renormalization with the shift of the interband ",
    "transition onset , both due to qp corrections , may yield ( in silver ) or may not yield ( in copper ) a sharp plasmon resonance .",
    "another important quantity is the reflectance , @xmath37 , where n is the complex refraction index defined by @xmath38}^2= \\gee{\\left(}\\go{\\right)}$ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the @xmath0 @xmath39 with the dft ",
    "lda one , and with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the latter shows a very narrow dip at @xmath1ev , close to the plasmon frequency , arising from the zero - reflectance point @xmath40 , defined as @xmath41 .",
    "again , the width and depth of this reflectance dip are related to the imaginary part of @xmath42 .",
    "gw corrections make @xmath40 to occur below the main onset of interband transitions , and hence produce a very narrow and deep reflectance minimum . here",
    "the agreement between @xmath0 results and experiments for the intensity and width of the dip at @xmath1ev is even more striking than in the eels .",
    "this result is of great importance for the optical and eels properties of ag _",
    "surfaces_. very recent calculations of reflectance anisotropy spectra ( ras ) within dft lda for ag(110 )  @xcite were not able to reproduce quantitatively a sharp dip observed experimentally .",
    "this feature , at an energy @xmath43ev , has been assigned to a bulk resonance , arising in the ras spectrum when @xmath44 .",
    "hence , it is the same occurring in the reflectance spectrum of fig .",
    "its width and shape are strongly related to the reflectance dip of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and therefore they need gw corrections to be well reproduced .",
    "we have performed a calculation of the eel and reflectivity spectra of silver within the rpa approach , using the quasiparticle band structure calculated within the ab ",
    "initio gw method .",
    "we have shown that the peculiar , well known plasmon peak in the eels and the deep reflectivity minimum observed experimentally , are quantitatively described by theory , for the first time without requiring adjustable parameters .",
