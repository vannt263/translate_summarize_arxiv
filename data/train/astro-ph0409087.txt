    "with several ultradeep _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys reaching flux limits as deep as @xmath12(alexander et al .",
    "2003 ; giacconi et al . 2002 ; hasinger 2003 ) , it is now clear that point sources account for almost all of the x - ray radiation above 2  kev in the universe ( mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; moretti et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these point sources are believed to be primarily active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , based on their x - ray luminosities .",
    "it has also been found that only @xmath13 of hard x - ray selected agn show broad lines in the optical , while @xmath14 appear to be normal galaxies in the optical at the sensitivity limits of the current optical spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "in contrast , the soft x - ray selected agn from _ rosat _ surveys are mostly identified as broad - line agn in the optical band ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the ultradeep surveys cover very small solid angles . in the case of the _ chandra _ deep fields ( cdfs ) , the combined sky coverage is @xmath15  deg@xmath1 .",
    "about 40% variance between fields is seen in the integrated fluxes in the @xmath5  kev band ( cowie et al . 2002 ) , likely as a result of the underlying large scale structure . to determine the fractional contribution of point sources to the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) with enough accuracy , and to understand how the cxb sources trace the large scale structure ,",
    "a sufficiently large solid angle is needed . while very large area surveys exist above @xmath16  ( 28 kev ) from _ asca _ ( akiyama et al . 2003 ) , the data around @xmath7  , where the point source contribution to the cxb peaks , is limited .    several intermediate , wide - field , serendipitous _ chandra / xmm - newton _ surveys ( baldi et al .  2002 ; kim et al .  2004 ; harrison et al .",
    "2003 ) were designed to increase the solid angle to several degrees at a @xmath5  kev flux limit of @xmath7  .",
    "one of the advantages of such surveys is that they sample randomly across the sky , so the probability of all of them hitting overdense or underdense regions is small .",
    "this is useful in determining the normalization of logn - logs . on the other hand ,",
    "serendipitous surveys suffer from the non - uniform observing conditions for each pointing , and in most cases , the pointings contain bright sources .",
    "the biases introduced by these non - uniformities are hard to quantify .",
    "the serendipitous surveys also have little power in addressing the question of large scale structure traced by x - ray selected agn , due to the small solid angle of each pointing , sparse and random positions on the sky , and the non - uniformity of the observations . with serendipitous surveys ,",
    "it is also difficult to perform extensive optical spectroscopic follow - up observations , which are critical in obtaining the redshifts and spectral classifications of the x - ray sources .",
    "this is due in part to the advent of large format detectors for imaging and spectroscopy ( like those on the subaru and keck telescopes ) , which are more efficient at targeting large - area , contiguous x - ray surveys , rather than many isolated acis - i pointings .",
    "a contiguous , large solid angle survey can compensate for these disadvantages and bridge the gap between the ultradeep `` pencil beam '' surveys and the large area serendipitous surveys in determining both the normalization of the logn - logs and the large scale structure .    in 2001",
    ", we began the _",
    "chandra _ large area synoptic x - ray survey ( clasxs ) of the multiwavelength data - rich _ iso _ lockman hole - northwest ( lhnw ) region .",
    "the survey currently covers a solid angle of @xmath0  deg@xmath1 and is sensitive to a factor of @xmath17 below the `` knee '' of the @xmath5  kev logn - logs .",
    "such a choice of solid angle and depth maximizes the detection efficiency with _ chandra_. the large solid angle is important for obtaining statistically significant source counts at the `` knee '' of the logn - logs and to test for variance of the number counts on larger solid angles .",
    "the choice of solid angle is based on the _ asca _ results that the rms variance of the @xmath18  kev cxb on a scale of 0.5  deg@xmath1 is @xmath19 ( kushino et al .",
    "the expected variance at the angular scale of our field should be less than the uncertainty of the cxb flux .",
    "the uniform nature of the survey allows an unbiased measurement of agn clustering .",
    "we have shown that the field - to - field variance seen between the deep fields can be reproduced within the 9 fields in our survey ( yang et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter yang03 ) .",
    "our survey region is covered by the deepest 90 and 170@xmath20 m isophot observations ( kawara et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as abundant multiwavelength observations , including the planned _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) .",
    "we performed extensive optical follow - up observations using subaru , cfht , wiyn , and keck to obtain multicolor images and spectra of the x - ray sources ( steffen et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter steffen04 ) .",
    "these observations provide critical information on the redshifts , spectroscopic classifications and luminosities of the x - ray sources , as well as on the morphologies of the host galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that the subarcsecond spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is critical to allow the unambiguous identification of optical counterparts .",
    "we describe our observations and data analysis methods in  2 and present our x - ray catalog in  3 . in  4 , we present the x - ray spectral properties and variability of the point sources . in  5 , we present our analysis of the extended sources and report on the discovery of a gravitational lensing arc associated with one of the clusters .",
    "we summarize the paper in  6 .",
    "a companion paper by steffen04 presents our multiwavelength observations and analysis .",
    "we will present the spatial correlation functions of the x - ray sources in a subsequent paper . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath21 and a flat universe with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we surveyed the lhnw field centered at @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the region has the lowest galactic absorption ( @xmath26 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "all 9 acis - i observations were obtained with the standard configuration .",
    "the pointings are separated from each other by 10  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the fields are labeled lhnw1 - 9 for reference hereafter .",
    "the overlapping of the fields allows a uniform sky coverage , because the sensitivity of the telescope drops significantly at large off - axis angles .",
    "fields lhnw1 - 3 were observed during april 30th to may 17th 2001 , and the rest of the fields were observed during april 29th to may 4th 2002 . all fields except lhnw1 have exposure times of @xmath27  ks .",
    "lhnw1 is located at the center of the field and has an exposure time of 73  ks .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we reduced the data with ciao v2.3 and the calibration files in caldb v2.20 . for our spectral analysis",
    ", we updated the data reduction with ciao v3.01 and caldb 2.23 to allow the use of cti corrected calibration files . we followed the ciao analysis threads ( available online at http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/ ) in reducing the data , including the correction of known aspect problems , cti problems , and removing high background intervals .",
    "background flares were found in lhnw3 and lhnw6 and have been removed .",
    "the resulting event lists were rebinned into @xmath3  kev ( soft ) , @xmath5  kev ( hard ) , and @xmath9  kev ( full ) broadband images .",
    "spectral weighted exposure maps were made for each band for each observation , using the observation specified bad pixel files .",
    "the detection sensitivity of _ chandra _ drops rapidly beyond 6  off - axis .",
    "for this reason , we overlapped our acis - i fields so that the sensitivity of the survey would be uniform across the field .",
    "since the added signal - to - noise from merging the observations is relatively small , we chose to detect sources in each observation individually and merge the catalogs , rather than to detect sources directly on the merged image .",
    "this method certainly loses some sensitivity for very dim sources at some locations .",
    "however , since our major interest is to obtain a uniform sample for statistical and follow - up purposes , such a choice is justified .",
    "the method also simplifies the source flux extraction because the psf information could easily be used .",
    "multiple detections of sources in independent observations are very useful for checking and improving the x - ray positions of the sources .",
    "multiple detections also provide an opportunity for measuring the variability of these sources .    from the various detection tools available ,",
    "we chose to use the _ wavdetect _ tool included in the ciao package ( freeman et al .",
    "2002 ) . since _ wavdetect _ uses a set of scales to optimize the source detection , the tool is excellent in separating nearby sources in crowded fields . in general",
    ", the method also provides better sensitivity than the classical `` sliding box '' methods .",
    "the drawbacks of _ wavdetect _ are that it runs rather slowly on large images like the full resolution acis - i images , and it requires fine - tuning of the parameters .",
    "wavdetect _ on the full resolution images with wavelet scales of @xmath28 .",
    "although using larger scale sizes could help to detect very far off - axis sources , it is not very useful for our survey , because of the overlapping of fields",
    ". it also increases the computation time to use a large number of scales .",
    "we chose to use a significance threshold of @xmath29 , which translates to a probability of false detection of 0.4 per acis - i field based on monte carlo simulation results ( freeman et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "observations performed before 2002-may-02 suffer from an systematic aspect offset as large as 2   from an error in the pipeline software .",
    "this systematic error was carefully calibrated by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center and corrections are provided .",
    "for the affected fields , lhnw1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 , we corrected this error following the standard procedures ( see _ chandra _ analysis thread online at http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/arcsec_correction/ ) .",
    "we further matched the small off - axis x - ray positions reported in each field from _ wavdetect _ to the optical images .",
    "corrections were then found to maximize the matches .",
    "such corrections are very small .",
    "the astrometric improvement also only marginally improved the matching between the x - ray catalogs , thanks to the excellent astrometric accuracy of the instrument .",
    "the corrected x - ray catalogs from each observation were then merged (  3.1 ) .",
    "a further absolute astrometric correction was applied to the merged x - ray catalog to match to the radio sources in the field . in figure 2",
    ", we show the offsets between the corrected positions and the optical positions for sources in different off - axis angle ranges .",
    "large offsets often occur when the x - ray source is at large off - axis angles .",
    "offsets are generally small , with a dispersion of 0.23for all the sources detected .",
    "_ wavdetect _ is excellent at detecting sources , but it is not always the best method for flux extraction .",
    "three issues could contribute to an incorrect estimation of source counts in _",
    "wavdetect_. first , the flux measurements in _ wavdetect _ use a monochromatic psf size , which , by default , corresponds to an enclosed energy of 0.393 at the energy of choice , or the @xmath30 integrated volume of a normalized two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "though this parameter is adjustable , larger enclosed energy values could cause confusion of close sources . since the construction of source cells",
    "is carried out by convolving the source image with wavelet functions , the `` smearing '' effects of the convolution can in general make the source cell large enough to include most of the source photons , but the fraction of the flux recovered varies from source to source .",
    "second , due to the statistical fluctuations in the source photon distribution , some sources show multiple peaks in the convolved image .",
    "unless perfect psf information is available , randomness should exist in determining which peak belongs to a single source .",
    "this problem is particularly severe when the source is very off - axis and the psf shape can not be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "the third issue is the background determination , a problem other methods also share .",
    "the background in _",
    "wavdetect _ is obtained in the immediate neighborhood of the source .",
    "this is useful because of the known large background fluctuations . however ,",
    "if the background is drawn too close to the source , the psf wing would likely be taken as background .",
    "this could result in an over - subtraction of the background and lead to underestimated source counts .",
    "this effect is seen in a correlation of source counts with background density in the _ wavdetect _ results .",
    "all of these issues would lead to an underestimation of source counts .",
    "this has been noticed in the analysis of the deep _ chandra _ fields ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; hornschemeier , private communication ) .",
    "because of the spectral differences of the sources and the sensitivity differences between energy bands , sources detected in one band are not always detected in another at high significance .",
    "there is no simple way within _",
    "wavdetect _ to provide upper limits for these sources .",
    "to obtain the source fluxes or upper limits in the non - detection band , an alternative flux extraction method is needed .    for these reasons",
    ", we wrote an aperture photometry tool for source flux extraction .",
    "the method uses a simple circular aperture which matches the size of the psf . to do this , we first compared the broadband psfs derived from our observations with the psf size file provided with ciao , as described below .      both the psf library used by the ciao tool _",
    "mkpsf _ and the circularly averged psfs used by the detection codes ( psfsize20010416.fits ) are generated at monochromatic energies using simulations of the telescope .",
    "spectral weighted average energy is usually used for selecting the psf file for broadband images .",
    "since the spectra of the x - ray sources are mostly unknown , an average spectrum has to be assumed .",
    "whether such selected psfs agree with the observed broadband psfs needs to be tested .",
    "we constructed `` average psfs '' for different off - axis angles using sources which have no neighbors within 40   in our 9 observations ( figure 3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that these psfs are inaccurate at large scales because the psf wings , which span more than 1 , could not be well determined in these observations .",
    "the source images from the same off - axis annuli are stacked , and the curves - of - growth are constructed .",
    "the background regions are fitted with quadratic forms using nonlinear least - square fits . to compare with the library psfs used by _",
    "wavdetect _ , we linearly interpolated the library psfs to the off - axis angles and the spectral weighted averaged energies . to account for the fact that part of the psf wings had been fitted as background in our data , we did the same `` background fitting '' on the interpolated psfs .",
    "this allows a comparison of the observed curve with the interpolated psf .",
    "the broadband psfs are generally narrower than the interpolated psfs , except for one case in the hard band where the off - axis angle is large .",
    "we performed our flux extractions in the following way .",
    "we used circular extraction cells , choosing the radius of cells from the psf library at a nominal enclosed energy of @xmath31 ( the true enclosed energy should be @xmath3295% based on the discussion above ) if the cell size is @xmath33 .",
    "for source close to the aim point , a fixed 2.5   radius was used .",
    "the background is estimated in an annulus region with an area 4 times as big as the source cell area , with inner radius 5   larger than the source cell radius .",
    "to avoid nearby sources being included in the background region , the background region is divided into 8 equal - sized segments ( figure 4 ) . the mean background counts are estimated , excluding the segment which contains the highest number of events .",
    "then the @xmath34 poisson upper limit is derived using the approximations provided in gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "the background is then recalculated with only the background segments that contain counts less than the upper limit .",
    "the net counts are obtained by subtracting the background from the source counts within the source cell .",
    "we compare the obtained net counts with the net counts obtained with",
    "_ wavdetect _ ( figure 5 ) .",
    "while they mostly agree , the source photons derived from our method are , on average , higher than those from _ wavdetect _ , especially for low - count sources .",
    "the average increases are 4% , 7% , and 8% for the soft , full , and hard bands , respectively .",
    "we hand - checked the sources with large discrepancies from the two methods , and we found our estimates to be more reliable .",
    "the prerequisite for using exposure maps is that the effective area is only weakly dependent on energy .",
    "this is not the case for our broadband images , where the effective area changes rapidly with energy . using exposure maps blindly , even the spectrally weighted ones ,",
    "will inevitably introduce large errors in the resulting fluxes .",
    "however , the vignetting ( the positional changes of sensitivity ) is less sensitive to energy . in other words ,",
    "if we normalize the exposure maps obtained at different energies to the aim points , then the differences between such `` normalized exposure maps '' are very small .",
    "based on this fact , we use the exposure maps only to correct for vignetting and compute the flux conversion at the aim point using spectral modeling .",
    "we first make full resolution spectrally weighted exposure maps ( using monochromatic maps do not change the results significantly ) .",
    "for each source , the exposure map is convolved with the psf generated using _",
    "mkpsf _ and normalized to the exposure time at the aim point .",
    "this is the effective exposure time if the source is at the aim point .",
    "the conversion factor is then obtained at the aim point by assuming the source has a galactic , absorbed , single power - law spectrum .",
    "the power - law index is calculated using the hardness ratio of each source , defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the count rates in the hard and soft bands .",
    "xspec was used in computing the conversion from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and for calculating the conversions .",
    "the degradation of quantum efficiency during the flight of the observatory has been accounted for using the standard procedure .",
    "we first merged the three band catalogs .",
    "we used a @xmath34 error ellipse from the _ wavdetect _ output as the identification cell .",
    "flux extraction was then performed on all entries in the merged catalogs in all bands using the best position of the sources .",
    "we compared the three band catalogs with the optical catalog to find the astrometric corrections for each observation , as described in  2.3 .",
    "the nine catalogs were then merged .",
    "the fluxes of the sources with more than one detection in the 9 fields were taken from the observation in which the effective area of the source was the largest , except for those sources with more than 2 detections having normalized areas @xmath40 , where we took the averaged flux .",
    "we visually checked the final catalog to ensure the correctness of the merging process .",
    "the final catalog contains 525 sources .    the distribution of the source off - axis angles in the merged catalog is shown in figure 6 .",
    "it can be seen that most of the sources fall within the @xmath41   range .",
    "figure 7 shows the distribution of sources with multiple detections .",
    "about 1/3 of the sources have more than one observation .",
    "we present the final catalog in two tables ( table 2a and table 2b ) . in table 2a",
    ", we list the source positions , fluxes , and hardness ratios . in table 2b",
    ", we list the source net counts , effective exposures , and detection information .",
    "* table 2a : basic properties *    * column 1 * : source number used in the catalog .",
    "the numbers correspond to ascending order of right ascension .    * column 2 * : source name follows the iau convention and should read cxcclasxs , plus the name given in the table .    * columns 3  4 * : the x - ray position , corrected for the aspect errors of the telescope , if applicable , and for the general astrometric solution by comparing with the optical images ( see  2.3 ) . for sources with multiple detections in the three bands and the 9 observations , the best position is taken .    *",
    "columns 5  6 * : statistical error of the x - ray position quoted from the _ wavdetect _ lists .",
    "* columns 7  9 * : x - ray fluxes in the soft , hard , and full bands in units of @xmath42  . if a source is detected in multiple observations , and if there are more than one observation in which the source effective area is more than 80% of the effective area at the aim point , then the mean flux is used ; otherwise , the flux from the observation that has the largest effective area is used .",
    "the errors quoted are the @xmath30 upper and lower limits , using the approximations from gehrels ( 1986 ) . for any source detected in one band but with a very weak signal in another",
    ", the background subtracted flux could be negative . in this case",
    ", only the upper limit is quoted .",
    "* columns 10 * : hardness ratio as defined in  2.4.3 .",
    "the upper or lower limit is listed for a source with no net extracted photons in the soft or hard bands .    * table 2b : additional properties *    * column 1 * : source number .",
    "* columns 24 * : net counts in the soft , hard , and full bands .",
    "if a source is detected in multiple observations , then the observation in which the source has the largest effective area ( see column 8) is used . as in table 2a , for the sources with negative counts",
    ", only the upper limits are listed .",
    "* columns 57 * : effective exposure time in each of the three energy bands from the exposure map .    * columns 89 * : detection information .",
    "column 8 is the lhnw field number where the source has the largest effective area .",
    "column 9 lists the lhnw field numbers ( each digit represents a field number ) in which the source has been detected in at least one of the three bands .",
    "sources with multiple detections are necessary for the detection of variability ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "incompleteness can be caused by energy or positional dependence of the sensitivity of x - ray telescopes . because the spectrum of a source carries important information on the physical nature of the source itself , sources of different spectra are usually categorized as different types .",
    "the energy dependent sensitivity acts like a filter in selecting `` hard '' and `` soft '' types of x - ray sources .",
    "the soft band detected sources always contain more soft spectrum objects than the hard band detected sources and _ vice versa_. unless the fraction of each type remains constant for all fluxes ( which we now know is not true ) , the energy dependent incompleteness can not be easily corrected .",
    "this issue is very important in interpreting the fraction of different types of objects in flux limited surveys .",
    "it is desirable to obtain number counts for each type of source , but it is hard to do that for the cxb sources , because the spectra are hard to determine . for our medium",
    "deep survey , it is sensible to follow tradition and only discuss the number counts in energy bands .",
    "the positional dependent incompleteness is caused by vignetting and aberration of the x - ray optics .",
    "the vignetting causes the effective area to drop with off - axis angle , and the aberration makes the off - axis psf larger so that it includes a larger number of background events in the source cell .",
    "the net effect is that the sensitivity of source detection drops with increasing off - axis angle .",
    "the sky area is therefore flux dependent .",
    "these effects can be investigated via monte carlo simulations .",
    "we first generated background images using observations of fields # 1 and # 4 , which represent the 70  ks and 40  ks exposures .",
    "point sources are removed from the images , and the holes left in the images are filled by sampling the local background .",
    "random sources are generated uniformly on the background images .",
    "the fluxes of the sources are generated by randomly sampling a complete subset of the combined _ chandra _ deep fields catalog ( alexander et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the subset contains only sources with hard band fluxes @xmath43and effective exposure times @xmath44  ks .",
    "the input fluxes are converted to on - axis counts assuming power - law spectra with @xmath45 .",
    "the exposure map for each image is consulted to find the vignetting effect at the source location , and the normalized exposure is multiplied by the true counts to obtain the `` observed '' net counts . only sources with more than 3 counts are used in the simulation to avoid adding too many undetectable dim sources to the background .",
    "we use the ciao tool _",
    "mkpsf _ to generate realistic source shapes at the source positions and energies .",
    "the psf is then sampled to have the same number of photons as in the source .",
    "we chose to use _ mkpsf _ instead of using the _ chandra _ simulator marx because we find the psf library used by _",
    "mkpsf _ better resembles sources at large off - axis angles .",
    "the number density of the sources is chosen to be 2 times higher than the observed density to increase the number of simulated sources without affecting detections .",
    "we ran 100 simulations on the 2 fields and the three energy bands and detected the sources using _ wavdetect _ with identical parameter settings to those we used in preparing the observed catalog .",
    "because of the large computation time , the number of simulations that can be done is limited .",
    "we then compared the output catalogs with the input source catalogs . because of the small size of the simulation , the completeness within 4   is not well determined , and a 5% uncertainty exists in the determined fractions .",
    "fortunately , the psf effect is small at such small off - axis angles . for a given flux threshold ,",
    "the fraction of source detections drops monotonically with off - axis angle .",
    "this relation is fitted between 4   and 10   with a linear least - squares fit .",
    "the 95% complete off - axis angle limit is then taken from the interpolation of the fit .",
    "the resulting flux thresholds versus off - axis radii are shown for the three bands and the two exposure times in figure 8 .",
    "we note that at large off - axis angles , the sensitivity drops rapidly .",
    "this is due to the choice of wavelet scales . when the largest scale used becomes smaller than the psf size of the source , _ wavdetect _ is no longer sensitive",
    "this effect , however , is not important for our observations , because most of the sources of interest are within 6  off - axis , thanks to the overlapping of fields . with these curves , we are able to make threshold maps for the combined catalogs of all three bands .",
    "sources at very large off - axis angles are excluded from the study of the logn - logs .",
    "the combined solid angle versus flux thresholds is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the poisson fluctuations in the source fluxes could result in an overestimation of number counts close to the detection limits .",
    "this is known as the eddington bias .",
    "the effect depends both on the slope of the logn - logs and the level of fluctuation . for the clasxs field",
    ", the detection threshold is below the `` knee '' of the logn - logs , and the eddington bias is relatively small .",
    "we corrected this bias using the method described in viklinin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in figure 10 ,",
    "we compare the average input flux with the average output flux at different off - axis angles from the simulations . for the soft band ,",
    "the correction is only important below @xmath46  .",
    "for the hard band , the correction is important below @xmath47  .",
    "we fit flux  flux curves in figure 10 for the different off - axis angles with fourth order polynomials and correct the source fluxes in the observed catalog using these fits .",
    "sources are selected by consulting the threshold map at the source positions and including only those with eddington bias corrected fluxes higher than the threshold map values .",
    "sources very far off - axis are excluded from the analysis . with these selections",
    ", we used a total of 310 and 235 sources in the soft and hard bands , respectively , to construct the logn - logs .",
    "the cumulative logn - logs relations are computed using the formula @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the complete solid angle .",
    "we show the results in figure 11 in the soft and hard bands with @xmath30 poisson errors .",
    "the differential logn - logs for the two bands are shown in figure 12 , which are calculated using the formula @xmath50 in units of deg@xmath51 per @xmath42  .",
    "we fit the resulting differential number counts with single or broken power laws in the form of @xmath52 using error weighted least - square fits .",
    "since our survey best samples the `` knee '' of the logn - logs , the slope of the power - laws are not well constrained due to the lack of data points both far above and below the `` knee '' . on the other hand , @xmath53 is better determined , to within @xmath54 .    for the soft band ,",
    "we fit the number counts between @xmath42 and @xmath7  with a power law .",
    "we find the best - fit parameters to be @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    ", a field with a solid angle of @xmath78  deg@xmath1 seems to be large enough to be representative .",
    "the detection of the large variance in the hard band source counts around @xmath7  on our survey scale seems to indicate that the sources that emerge at this flux are more clustered on the sky than the soft band selected sources .",
    "these sources could account for most of the cosmic variance observed .",
    "this issue will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "we employ a hardness ratio (  2.4.3 ) to quantify statistically the spectra of the cxb sources in our field .",
    "figure 13 shows the distribution of hardness ratio versus full band flux .",

    "spectral analyses with _ xmm - newton _ observations indicate that such a flattening is mainly caused by absorption .",
    "these obscured agn must dominate the population around the `` knee '' of the logn - logs to account for the flat spectrum of the cxb .",
    "since most of the _ xmm - newton _ spectral observations have reached a few times @xmath7  ( piconcelli et al . 2002 ) , and the mean spectrum at this threshold is still too soft compared with that of the cxb , a sharp increase of obscuration or a change of spectral shape at a flux @xmath6  is inevitable .",
    "such a sharp change is seen in the change of hardness ratio in our wide - field sample .      x - ray variability is an important factor in distinguishing agn from starburst galaxies .",
    "almost all agn vary in x - rays , except those sources which are compton thick .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that only a small fraction of the optically faint x - ray sources vary .",
    "possible explanations could be that a large fraction of the optically faint sources are compton thick , or that the amplitude of variation of the optically faint sources is much lower than that of the broad and/or narrow - line agn at the same flux thresholds .",
    "we examine the variability of sources that have been detected in more than one of our observations .",
    "since the observations were taken in two groups , separated by about one year , and each group of observations were taken within a few days ( see table 1 ) , we are able to test variability on timescales of days and/or one year , depending on the location of the source .    for timing analyses with low counts per bin ,",
    "the usual @xmath83 statistic is inadequate .",
    "we use the @xmath84-statistic ( cash 1979 ) in testing the significance of variability . cash ( 1979 )",

    "we restricted the sample for the variability test to sources with expected counts greater than 10 in all observations .",
    "the null hypothesis rejection probability was chosen to be 0.01 .",
    "a total of 168 sources were tested for variability , of which 42 sources are significantly variable and 28 sources show variability on timescales of days .",

    ", @xmath96 can be used as a good indicator of whether the variability exceeds the poisson noise .",
    "it has been found that there exists a good anti - correlation between @xmath96 and agn luminosity ( nandra et al .",

    "the average @xmath96 is significantly lower than at lower fluxes . as mentioned above",
    ", variability is harder to detect for low flux sources , unless the source is more variable than that of the brighter sources , so this bias could explain why there are very few low flux , low variability sources in the plot .",
    "in addition , the sources we detect to be variable are generally soft .",
    "this is consistent with the observation from the cdfs that optically faint sources ( most of which are hard spectrum agn ) are less variable ( alexander et al . 2001 ) .",
    "very little is known about the spectral variability of the sources that contribute the most to the cxb due to a lack of data .",
    "spectral variability is seen in about half of the well - studied brighter sources , with a general trend of softening of the @xmath18  kev spectra with increasing source intensity . but a counterexample is ngc7469 , where the spectrum flattens when the source flux increases ( barr 1986 ) .",
    "the variability could be accounted for either with a change in the relative normalization of the different spectral components or by variation in the absorption .    in figure 18",
    ", we show hardness ratios versus full band fluxes for the variable sources .",
    "while most of the sources show either no clear spectral variability , or a trend of spectral softening with increasing flux , there are a number of sources that clearly become harder with increasing flux .",
