    "turbulent flows in many different physical and engineering applications have a reynolds number so high that a direct numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equations ( dns ) is not feasible .",
    "the large - eddy simulation ( les ) is a method in which the large scales of turbulence only are directly solved while the effects of the small - scale motions are modelled .",
    "the mass , momentum and energy equations are filtered in space in order to obtain the governing equation for the large scale motions .",
    "the momentum and energy transport at the large - scale level due to the unresolved scales is represented by the so - called subgrid terms .",
    "standard models for such terms , as , for example , the widely used smagorinsky model , are based on the assumption that the unresolved scales are present in the whole domain and that turbulence is in equilibrium at subgrid scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis can be questionable in free , transitional and highly compressible turbulent flows where subgrid scales , that is fluctuations on a scale smaller than the space filter size , are not simultaneously present in the whole domain .",
    "in such situations , subgrid models such as smagorinsky s overestimate the energy flow toward subgrid scales and , from the point of view of the large , resolved , scales , they appear as over - dissipative by exceedingly damping the large - scale motion .",
    "for instance , simulation of astrophysical jets could suffer from such limitation . in this regard",
    ", any improvement of the les methodology is opportune .",
    "astrophysical flows occur in very large sets of spatial scales and velocities , are highly compressible ( mach number up to @xmath1 ) and have a reynolds number which can exceed @xmath2 , so that only the largest scales of the flow can be resolved even by the largest simulation in the foreseeable future . as a consequence , today , in this field , les appears as a feasible simulation methods able to predict the unsteady system behaviour .",
    "we have recently proposed a simple method to localize the regions where the flow is underresolved @xcite .",
    "the criterion is based on the introduction of a local functional of vorticity and velocity gradients .",
    "the regions where the fluctuations are unresolved are located by means of the scalar probe function @xcite which is based on the vortical stretching - tilting sensor : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity vector , @xmath5 is the vorticity vector and the overbar indicates the statistical average",
    ". function ( [ f - dnsfluctuation ] ) is a normalized scalar form of the vortex - stretching term that represents the inertial generation of three dimensional vortical small scales inside the vorticity equation . when the flow is three dimensional and rich in small scales @xmath0 is necessarily different from zero , while , on the other hand , it is instead equal to zero in a two - dimensional vortical flow where the vortical stretching is absent .",
    "the mean flow is subtracted from the velocity and vorticity fields in order to consider the fluctuating part of the field only .    .",
    "the initial velocity field is a laminar parallel flow , with an initial mach number equal to 5 , perturbed by eight waves which have an amplitude equal to 5%  of the axis jet velocity and a wavelength from @xmath6 to @xmath7 times @xmath8 . ]     of the probability that @xmath9 ( see equation [ f - dnsfluctuation ] ) and thus the probability that subgrid terms are introduced in the selective les balance equation by the localization procedure .",
    "the lines represent the points where the longitudinal velocity @xmath10 is constant , where @xmath11 is the jet axis mean velocity .",
    "all data in this figure have been computed averaging on lines parallel to the jet axis . a three - dimensional animation which shows the time evolution of the underresolved regions where the subgrid terms are introduced in the selective les can be seen in the supplemental material .",
    "]    a priori test of the spatial distribution of functional test have been performed by computing the statistical distribution of @xmath0 in a fully resolved turbulent fluctuation field ( dns of a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , data from @xcite ) ) and in some unresolved instances obtained by filtering this dns field on coarser grids ( from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the probability that @xmath0 assumes values larger than a given threshold @xmath16 is always higher in the filtered fields and increases when the resolution is reduced .",
    "the difference between the probabilities in fully resolved and in filtered turbulence is maximum when @xmath16 is in the range @xmath17 $ ] for all resolutions . in such a range",
    "the probability @xmath18 that @xmath0 is larger than @xmath16 in the less resolved field is about twice the probability in the dns field .",
    "furthermore , beyond this range this probability normalized over that of resolved dns fields it is gradually increasing becoming infinitely larger . from that it is possible to introduce a threshold @xmath16 on the values of @xmath0 , such that , when @xmath0 assumes larger values the field could be considered locally unresolved and should benefit from the local activation of the large eddy simulation method ( les ) by inserting a subgrid scale term in the motion equation .",
    "the values of this threshold is arbitrary , as there is no sharp cut , but it can be reasonably chosen as the one which gives the maximum difference between the probability @xmath18 in the resolved and unresolved fields .",
    "this leads to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the morkovin hypothesis , stating that the compressibility effects do not have much influence on the turbulence dynamics , apart from varying the local fluid properties @xcite , allows to apply the same value of the threshold in compressible and incompressible flows .",
    "such value of the threshold has been used to investigate the presence of regions with anomalously high values of the functional @xmath0 , by performing a set of a priori tests on existing euler simulations of the temporal evolution of a perturbed cylindrical hypersonic light jet with an initial mach number equal to 5 and ten times lighter than the surrounding external ambient @xcite .",
    "when the effect of the introduction of subgrid scale terms in the transport equation is extrapolated from those a priori tests , they positively compare with experimental results and show the convenience of the use of such a procedure @xcite .    in this paper we present large - eddy simulations of this",
    "temporal evolving jet , where the subgrid terms are selectively introduced in the transport equations by means of the local stretching criterion @xcite .",
    "the aim is not to model a specific jet , but instead to understand , from a physical point of view , the differences introduced by the presence of sub - grid terms in the under - resolved simulations of hypersonic jets .",
    "our localization procedure selects the regions where subgrid terms are applied and , as such , its effect could be considered equivalent to a model coefficient modulation , as the one obtained by the dynamic procedure @xcite or by the use of improved eddy viscosity smagorinsky - like models like vreman s model @xcite , which gives a low eddy viscosity in non turbulent regions of the flow . however , it operates differently because it is completely uncoupled from the subgrid scale model used as , unlike the common practical implementations of the dynamic procedure , does not require ensemble averaging to prevent unstable eddy viscosity .",
    "other alternatives , such as the approximate deconvolution model @xcite , are more complicated than the present selective procedure because involve filter inversion and the use of a dynamic relaxation term .",
    "the computational overload of the selective filtering is modest and can make les an affordable alternative to a higher resolution inviscid simulation : the selective les increases the computing time of about one - third with respect to an euler simulation , while the doubling of the resolution can increase the computing time by a factor of sixteen .",
    "c +    c +    c +    we have simulated the temporal evolution of a three dimensional jet in a parallelepiped domain with periodicity conditions along the longitudinal direction .",
    "the flow is governed by the ideal fluid equations ( mono - atomic gas flow ) for mass , momentum , and energy conservation .",
    "the beam is considered thermally confined by the external medium , and the initial pressure is set uniform in the entire domain . in the astrophysical context , this formulation is usually considered to approximate the temporal hydrodynamic evolution inside a spatial window of interstellar jets , which are highly compressible collimated jets characterized by reynolds numbers of the order @xmath20 .",
    "see for example , the herbig - haro jets hh24 , hh34 and hh47 @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the effect of the radiative cooling , which can change the jet dynamics substantially ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the transient evolution includes basically two principal mechanism , the growth and evolution of internal shocks and the dynamics of the mixing process originated by the nonlinear development of the kelvin helmholtz instability .",
    "the analysis is carried out through hydro - dynamical simulations by considering only a fraction of the beam which is far from its base and head . due to the use of the periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the jet material is continually processed by the earlier evolution because of the multiple transits though the computational domain . in this way",
    ", the focus is put on the instability evolution and on the interaction between the jet and the external medium , rather than an analysis of the global evolution of the jet .",
    "it is known that the numerical solution of a system of ideal conservation laws ( such as the euler equations ) actually produces the equivalent solution of another modified system with additional diffusion terms . with the discretizations used in this",
    "study it possible to estimate _ a posteriori _ that the numerical viscosity implies an actual reynolds number of about @xmath21 .",
    "in such a situation it is clear that the addition into the governing equations of the diffusive - dissipative terms relevant to a reynolds number in the range @xmath20 would be meaningless .",
    "the formulation used is thus the following : @xmath22 & = &     { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial x_i}}h(f_{\\rm les}-t_\\omega)q_i^{sgs}\\nonumber\\\\   & &     \\label{eq.ene } \\ ] ] where the field variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the filtered pressure , density , velocity , and total energy respectively .",

    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the subgrid stress tensor and total enthalpy flow , respectively .",

    "the threshold @xmath16 is here taken equal to 0.4 , which is the value for which the maximum difference between the probability density function @xmath33 between the filtered and unfiltered turbulence was observed @xcite .",
    "sensor @xmath0 , as defined in ( [ f - dnsfluctuation ] ) , does not depend on the subgrid model used and on the kind of discretization used to actually solve the filtered transport equations . in principle , it can be coupled with any subgrid model and any numerical scheme .",
    "we have chosen to implement the standard smagorinsky model as subgrid model , @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rate of strain tensor and @xmath37 its norm .",
    "constant @xmath38 has been set equal to 0.1 , which is the standard value used in the les of shear flows , and @xmath39 , the turbulent prandtl number , is taken equal to 1 .",
    "the initial flow configuration is an axially symmetric cylindrical jet in a parallelepiped domain , described by a cartesian coordinate system @xmath40 .",
    "the initial jet velocity is along the @xmath41-direction ; its symmetry axis is defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the interface between the jet and the surrounding ambient medium is described by a smooth velocity and density transition in order to avoid the spurious oscillations that can be introduced by a sharp discontinuity .",
    "the longitudinal velocity profile is thus initialized as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance from the jet axis , @xmath45 is the jet radius and @xmath11 the jet velocity .",
    "@xmath46 is a smoothing parameter which has been set equal to 4 .",
    "the same smoothing has been used for the initial density distribution , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the initial density inside the jet ambient and @xmath49 is the ratio between the ambient density at infinity to that of on the jet axis .",
    "a value of @xmath49 larger than one implies that the jet is lighter than the external medium .",
    "the mean pressure is set to a uniform value @xmath50 , that is , we are considering a situation where there is initially a pressure equilibrium between the jet and the surrounding environment .",

    "the integration domain is @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "in fact , as pointed out by @xcite , a high numerical viscosity can overwhelms the subgrid - scale terms effects .",

    "the main results is that even a simple model can give acceptable results when selectively used together with a sub - grid scale localization procedure .",
    "in fact , the comparison among the four kinds of simulations ( selective les , standard les , low and high resolution pseudo euler direct numerical simulations ) here carried out shows that this method can improve the dynamical properties of the simulated field . in particular",

    "furthermore , this method avoids the artificial over - damping of the unstable modes at the jet border which in the standard large eddy simulation inhibits the jet lateral growth . in comparison with an euler simulation which uses the same resolution , the selective les clearly improves the flow prediction when the field is reach in small scales ( up to the 50% on the momentum and 4% on the density fields ) .",
    "if , as in the example here shown , the kinetic energy in the small scales is not steady in the mean and decays , the improvement due to the use of the selective les in the long term reduces .",

    "the evolution of the kinetic energy of the fluctuations determines the extension of the underresolved regions where subgrid terms must be introduced in the governing equations , see the movie in the supplementary material visible online . ]    in synthesis , the selective les explicitly introduces the sub - grid flows of momentum and energy in the governing equations in the regions of the flow where turbulence is physically present . in this way",
    ", one does not rely on the numerical diffusion to mimic the overall behaviour of all unresolved scales .",

    "the computing time of the selective les is about one third larger than that of the low resolution euler simulation and seven times smaller than the one of the higher resolution euler simulation .",
    "therefore , a selective les could be more convenient than a better resolved euler simulation . because of this properties , given the modest computational burden brought to the simulation , the application of the selective procedure to the simulation of complex flows  in particular highly compressible free flows as , for instance , astrophysical jets  seems promising",
