    "a more recent model suggests that the oh masers are associated with a molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "this model proposes a shocked molecular torus origin for the southern masers , but questions remain regarding the overall morphology and velocity structure of the masers in on  1 .",
    "few northern star - forming regions have been mapped in the 6035  mhz line of oh , in part because few radio arrays in the northern hemisphere have been capable of tuning to the frequency . a previous three - station",
    "european vlbi network ( evn ) experiment detected seven 6035  mhz maser features in on  1 but only observed the redshifted masers @xcite .",
    "single - dish observations confirm that the 6030 and 6035  mhz masers in on  1 also appear in two disjoint velocity ranges , but zeeman pairing ambiguities have prevented a definitive measurement of the magnetic field of the blueshifted masers @xcite .",
    "the upgrade of the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) to the expanded vla ( evla ) presents new observational opportunities in north america @xcite . of interest to spectral line observers is the full frequency coverage between 1 and 50  ghz that will become available .",
    "this spring , the evla for the first time offered observational capabilities in the extended c - band range of 4.2 to 7.7  ghz , which includes key maser frequencies of oh and methanol .",
    "this letter reports on initial observations of 6035  mhz oh masers with the evla .",
    "the evla was used to observe the 6035.092  mhz line of oh toward on  1 on 2007  may  25 ( experiment code af459 ) .",
    "the array consisted of only the seven telescopes at the time equipped with the first evla c - band receivers , since the oh line is outside the tuning range of the older vla c - band receivers .",
    "the antennas used were distributed primarily along the western and northern arms of the vla a - configuration , giving maximum and minimum baselines of 28.1 and 2.6  km , respectively .",
    "data were taken in both left and right circular polarization ( lcp , rcp ) using a 781.25  khz bandwidth divided into 256 spectral channels , providing a channel width of 0.15  kms@xmath2 and a velocity range of 39  kms@xmath2 centered at @xmath4  kms@xmath2 ( doppler tracked ) .",
    "dual circular correlation products were obtained .",
    "about one hour of usable data were obtained , consisting of 40 minutes on the masers in on  1 and 10 minutes on the phase calibration source , 2023 + 318 .",
    "this was also used to set the flux scale ( assuming a flux density of 2.8  jy from the vla calibrator manual ) and for bandpass calibration .",
    "blank sky , single - polarization noise in the image plane with natural weighting was 30  mjybeam@xmath2 ( synthesized beam size @xmath5 , pa @xmath6 ) , approximately matching the expected thermal sensitivity .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that the assumed flux scale is too high by several tens of percent , based on recent variability seen in the the flux density of 2023 + 318 at 4.8  ghz from the vla flux density history database .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the flux scale between the two circular polarizations is better than 10% .",
    "the peak channel of the brightest maser , nearly 50  jybeam@xmath2 rcp , was used to determine the absolute position .",
    "the location of this maser , @xmath7 , + @xmath8 ( j2000 ) , is south and east of the location obtained from evn data by @xcite .",
    "the data in this channel were iteratively self - calibrated ( phase - only and amplitude - and - phase ) , and calibration solutions were applied to both polarizations in the entire data set .",
    "images measuring 30  in each direction centered on the brightest maser were created in lcp and rcp .",
    "a total of 19 maser features are detected , as listed in table  [ maser - table ] .",
    "two - dimensional gaussian components were fitted to each patch of maser emission above @xmath9 and grouped into features in one or more adjacent channels .",
    "one - dimensional gaussian components were fitted to the spectrum of each feature to determine the peak flux density and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) line width .",
    "this was not possible for features detected in fewer than three channels ( indicated by a missing line width in table  [ maser - table ] ) , so the peak flux and center velocity of the channel of the brightest maser emission are given for these features instead .",
    "taking into account the flux scale caveat , the brightest 6035  mhz maser in on  1 is approximately as bright or brighter than any maser seen in the ground - state transitions @xcite , as noted in w3(oh ) as well @xcite .",
    "the locations of the masers are shown in figure  [ map ] . also shown",
    "are ground - state masers detected with the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) by @xcite and with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite data are aligned relative to the @xcite data using the brightest maser detected in the former .",
    "the 6035  mhz masers appear to have a similar distribution to the ground - state masers near the continuum region .",
    "the apparent systematic southwardeastward shift of the 6035  mhz masers relative to the ground - state masers is significantly less than the beam size and is within the error of determining the relative alignment between the 6035  mhz and continuum reference frames .",
    "position centroids of the masers as measured in consecutive channels differ at the @xmath10 level but do not shift systematically with lsr velocity",
    ". this could be due to blending of nearby maser spots at slightly different velocities or due to position uncertainties caused by the sparse @xmath11-coverage and consequent beam elongation .",
    "the relative uncertainty in position accuracy between rcp and lcp spots is negligible ( @xmath12 ) in comparison .",
    "future observations with the evla , when more antennas with extended c - band tuning capability are available , should provide much better image fidelity , with correspondingly better determination of maser positions .",
    "the 6035  mhz maser velocities are systemically offset by approximately 0.1  kms@xmath2 from the @xcite effelsberg observations , 0.2  kms@xmath2 from the @xcite effelsberg observations , and 0.3  kms@xmath2 from the evn observations of @xcite .",
    "accounting for this , masers appear to be brighter on average than in previous epochs ; for instance , the brightest maser is at least three times as bright as seen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the overall brightening exceeds the errors due to the uncertain flux scale calibration in these observations and therefore appears to be a real effect .",
    "based on positional coincidence ( within the 200  mas uncertainties ) of lcp and rcp maser features at statistically significant different lsr velocities , six zeeman pairs are detected at 6035  mhz , listed in table  [ zeeman - table ] and indicated in red on figure  [ map ] .",
    "this gives 5 unambiguous pairs as well as a sixth ambiguous pair , as noted in table  [ zeeman - table ] , all consistenly indicating a negative magnetic field ( i.e. , one whose line - of - sight projection points toward the observer ) .",
    "three pairs where the velocity difference is less than the uncertainties are not included ; these could be due to small magnetic fields , linear polarization , or the pairing of unrelated features . assuming that the 6035  mhz masers should be shifted northward and westward",
    "slightly , the @xmath13  mg magnetic field agrees with the magnetic field values obtained at 1665  mhz .",
    "this also agrees with a previous zeeman measurement of this 6035  mhz pair of @xmath14  mg by @xcite , correcting for the previously noted velocity offsets .",
    "magnetic fields of approximately @xmath15  mg are detected on the western side of the continuum emission , in contrast with a weaker @xmath16  mg field detected at 1665  mhz .",
    "the 6030  mhz @xmath13  mg zeeman pair detected by @xcite may be located near the 6035  mhz @xmath17  mg zeeman pair at the same corrected systemic velocity , since @xcite note that 6030  mhz masers have a strong tendency to appear in very close spatial coincidence with brighter 6035  mhz masers . in any case , the magnetic field as detected by oh masers appears to be negative throughout the source , although the data do not rule out line - of - sight field reversals on small scales or where no masers are detected .    in the north , large ( @xmath0  mg )",
    "magnetic fields are detected . due to the large number of maser features in the north , single - dish measurements have had difficulty pairing the maser features unambiguously to determine a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite claim a magnetic field of @xmath18  mg , while @xcite claim magnetic fields from @xmath19 to @xmath20  mg at blueshifted velocities in the 6035  mhz transition , as well as a @xmath21  mg zeeman pair at 6030  mhz , whose systemic velocity is consistent with the 6035  mhz @xmath22  mg zeeman pair in table  [ zeeman - table ] , when correcting for the 0.2  kms@xmath2 offset .",
    "the larger ( absolute ) values are also more consistent with the @xmath23  mg zeeman pair detected in the blueshifted masers in the 13441  mhz highly excited state @xcite .",
    "future observations at higher angular and spectral resolution may be useful to confirm and reduce the errors on measurements of the magnetic field values at 6035  mhz .",
    "the ratio of the fluxes of the bright to weak components of a zeeman pair ranges from @xmath24 to 2.1 at 6035 mhz .",
    "the equivalent ratio for 1665  mhz masers is 2.134.4 , while at 1667  mhz two zeeman pairs have flux ratios of 2.3 and 2.8 @xcite .",
    "the two 1720  mhz zeeman pairs detected by @xcite each have a flux ratio of 1.1 .",
    "the zeeman pairs in on  1 thus fit the general pattern that the flux ratio between zeeman components decreases with decreasing zeeman splitting coefficient ( 0.59 , 0.354 , 0.114 components , but a detailed study of the 1720  mhz line profiles in another source , w3(oh ) , failed to find evidence of the outer hyperfine lines @xcite . ] , and 0.0564  kms@xmath2mg@xmath2 at 1665 , 1667 , 1720 , and 6035  mhz , respectively ; @xcite ) .    lrrrrll lcp & @xmath25 & @xmath26105 & 1003 & 1.10 & 0.29 & 1 + & @xmath27 & @xmath2678 & 996 & 2.73 & 0.28 & 2 + & @xmath28 & @xmath2675 & 1065 & 0.20 & & + & @xmath29 & @xmath2689 & 1045 & 0.76 & 0.25 & 3 + & @xmath30 & @xmath26234 & 964 & 0.50 & & + & @xmath31 & @xmath26833 & 703 & 0.38 & & 4 + & @xmath32 & 155 & 561 & 2.74 & 0.32 & + & @xmath33 & @xmath26912 & 653 & 3.67 & 0.36 & 5 + & @xmath34 & 96 & @xmath266 & 7.83 & 0.24 & + & @xmath35 & @xmath26200 & 70 & 3.48 & 0.25 & 6 + rcp & @xmath36 & @xmath2685 & 1017 & 1.98 & & 1 + & @xmath37 & @xmath2672 & 982 & 5.72 & 0.26 & 2 + & @xmath38 & @xmath2631 & 1022 & 0.40 & & 3 + & @xmath39 & @xmath26216 & 995 & 2.96 & 0.27 & + & @xmath40 & @xmath26969 & 655 & 0.40 & & 4 + & @xmath41 & @xmath2659 & 477 & 6.17 & & + & @xmath41 & @xmath26897 & 658 & 6.10 & & 5 + & @xmath42 & 0 & 0 & 49.47 & 0.20 & + & @xmath43 & @xmath26257 & 104 & 4.57 & 0.27 & 6    lrr 1 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + 2 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + 3 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + 4 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 + 5 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + 6 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 .",
    "the distributions of the 1665 and 6035  mhz masers are the most alike of any pair of oh transitions in on  1 .",
    "all the 1665  mhz maser regions have associated 6035  mhz masers , apart from in the center and in the extreme south , far from the exciting source where densities are likely to be low .",
    "the brightest masers at both transitions occur in the line of maser spots just south of center in figure  [ map ] .",
    "this contrasts with the 1612 , 1667 , and 1720  mhz masers , which are only found in the prominent line of masers south of and on the southwestern limb of the continuum source .",
    "a similar result was seen at vlbi resolution in w3(oh ) : 1665 and 6035  mhz masers appear throughout the source , 1612 and 1720  mhz masers appear only in and near the inner edge of an apparent shocked torus that is especially well traced by 6.0  ghz masers ( including several of the brightest 6.0  ghz masers detected ) , and 1667  mhz emission is largely concentrated in areas with an apparent shock morphology @xcite .",
    "higher - resolution observations of the 6.0  ghz masers in on  1 would be useful to obtain a better alignment of the 6035  mhz frame with respect to the other masers and determine whether the southern masers are located preferentially along the northern edge of the southern shock front .",
    "some of the 6035  mhz masers may be associated with an outflow , such as the h@xmath56co@xmath57 oriented northeast - southwest through on  1 detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that the southern line of oh masers is oriented nearly perpendicular to this structure and propose , based additionally on the linear polarization characteristics of the ground - state masers , that the masers trace a shock in a confining molecular torus .",
    "similar conclusions based on maser distribution and polarization are reached for other oh maser sources hosting outflows @xcite .",
    "this interpretation also bears a striking similarity to that proposed for w3(oh ) , which hosts very strong 6035  mhz masers @xcite , and may therefore suggest a common mechanism for producing strong 6035  mhz maser emission .",
    "it is probable that there is a coherent , organized structure in the northern part of on  1 .",
    "many lcp 1665  mhz masers , including one bright one , occur in the region , with a few weak rcp masers offset to the north and west of the lcp emission @xcite . assuming a magnetic field of approximately @xmath58  mg in the region ,",
    "lcp and rcp 1665  mhz maser components would be separated by 6  kms@xmath2 ( @xmath59 for an average line width of 0.3  kms@xmath2 ) if they both appear in the region .",
    "( it is likely that weak rcp 1665  mhz masers , seen near @xmath60  kms@xmath2 in the spectra of @xcite , pair with the dominant lcp masers near + 4  kms@xmath2 , but no published interferometric observations of the ground - state masers have included the @xmath60  kms@xmath2 features in the observed bandpass . ) if the magnetic field and velocity gradients are aligned such that the magnetic field strength decreases ( becomes less negative ) in the same direction that the velocity increases , amplification of the lcp component would be favored ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is much more pronounced for ground - state oh masers than at 6035  mhz , where the zeeman splitting is a factor of 10 smaller in velocity units , such that the lcp and rcp spectra are separated by @xmath61  kms@xmath62 per 10  mg , which is not in excess of the turbulent velocity component expected in a maser condensation @xcite .",
    "hence , 6035  mhz masers appear in both polarizations with similar fluxes , while strong lcp 1665  mhz emission appears at higher velocities ( and possibly weaker rcp emission at lower velocities ) .",
    "the key question that remains is how the blueshifted masers in the north connect to the redshifted masers in the south .",
    "it is tempting to associate both with the hco@xmath63 outflow , but the northern masers are significantly blueshifted compared to the hco@xmath63 velocity range of 816  kms@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these authors also note a co outflow in the region that spans a larger velocity range , but it is oriented roughly east - west . @xcite",
    "interpret the outflows as coming from two different sources embedded in the ultracompact region .",
    "it is possible that the blue and red oh masers are also associated with two different sources , which would complicate interpretation of their motions and morphology .",
    "the large ( @xmath64  mg ) magnetic fields suggest that the northern masers are near a region of higher density and therefore likely an excitation source . in w3(oh )",
    "the methanol masers in the region of highest magnetic field strength ( @xmath65  mg ) have been modelled as undergoing conical expansion , which @xcite interpret as possibly being due to an outflow guided by the helical field from a magnetized disk .      excluding minor transitional issues , the performance of the evla antennas was as expected .",
    "early data from the antennas with upgraded c - band capability are of good quality and are already producing useful science ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the upgrade continues , more antennas with 6.0  ghz tuning capability will be added to the array , providing propotionally better sensitivity and imaging characteristics .",
    "high spectral resolution vlbi observations of the 1665 and 6035  mhz oh masers , of the sort obtained for w3(oh ) @xcite , may help answer the questions of whether there is an organized velocity structure in the north and what structure the masers are tracing . if the segregated regions of lcp and rcp emission in the north are due to correlated magnetic and velocity field gradients , small - scale velocity gradients ( i.e. , on the size scale of a maser spot ) of the northern masers may show similar magnitudes and position angles .",
    "this would contrast with w3(oh ) , in which small - scale velocity gradients show no correlation except when masers overlap @xcite .",
    "any such observations of the ground - state masers should have a sufficiently wide bandwidth coverage to include the @xmath60  kms@xmath2 1665  mhz masers in order to be able to identify magnetic field strengths ( and variations thereof ) throughout the northern masers . while observations of linear polarization exist for the ground - state masers @xcite , full - polarization observations at 6035  mhz would help to understand the magnetic field geometry , since linear polarization vectors are much less subject to being corrupted by external and internal faraday rotation at the higher frequency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
