    "objective realism means that all physical quantities ( e.g. field and currents ) have well defined values at all times and positions , although they may be random .",
    "the values are independent of the fact of being observed .",
    "objective realism in macroscopic world is obvious , but in microworld it is at best ambiguous due conceptual problems of the quantum description .",
    "moreover , practical and useful physics relies on free choice  an ability to affect the system in real time .",
    "freedom of choice means that we are not mere spectators of the world s evolution but can actively change its fate .",
    "free choice localized in time and space is important in the interpretation of tests of local realism @xcite . incorporating of free choice into theory is done by adding some variable parameters ( usually localized ) , meaning a variety of choices .",
    "however , observations for different choices are not always compatible in quantum realism , as shown by bell theorem ( for a particular state and choices ) @xcite .    here",
    "we try to assign joint objective realism for all choices , asking if there exists common joint positive probability .",
    "it will turn out that it is possible but violating relativistic invariance .",
    "the argument about relativity is different from commonly used bell theorem .",
    "bell theorem does not rely at all on relativity , it only states that observers separated so that their observations are mutually compatible should get  for a special state and choices  nonlocal correlations ( if objective realism holds then the choice of one observer affects the observation of the other  compatible  observer ) . on the other hand ,",
    "compatibility means lack of signaling  remote choice can not affect local observation ( not correlation ) .",
    "the compatibility or no - signaling is usually assumed for observations beyond the reach of speed of light .",
    "this fact in turn is either postulated @xcite or can be justified perturbatively , relying on relativistic invariance @xcite . in this paper , instead of this hybrid reasoning , we address the problem directly using relativistic quantum field theory @xcite ( relying on different assumptions than the bell theorem ) .",
    "we will show that indeed objective realism with free choice can not stand with both relativistic invariance and quantum theory .",
    "if relativity is to drop , then binding the assumption of the bell theorem about compatibility with relativistic no - signaling may be false and there might be signaling faster that light  to be tested experimentally .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with the general construction of quantum mechanics and field theory with free choice .",
    "next , we state the problem of realism and attempts of quantum construction , insisting on agreement with relativity . finally , we show that relativistic invariance must be broken , by a perturbative example , and discuss possible consequences , including superluminal signaling .",
    "we close the paper with conclusions .",
    "a general construction of quantum observations , satisfying principle of objective realism , will be completed if the observations depend on free - to - choose options , readouts for all options simultaneously are represented by a positive probability .",
    "all events , free choices and measurements will be referred by time - position @xmath0 ( time @xmath1 , spatial coordinates @xmath2 ) .",
    "speed of light @xmath3 and planck constant @xmath4 are @xmath5 in our units .",
    "given the initial state of the system ( universe ) and it dynamics , hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 , the _ free choice _",
    "@xmath7 means a parametric decision to modify the dynamics by an extra term in the hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "if this terms is nonzero only around a specific point in spacetime , then we can claim it as localized which is important e.g. in the bell theorem .",
    "however , for our considerations @xmath8 will be completely general .",
    "there can be many such defined choices , @xmath9 .",
    "we denote @xmath10 an observable ( hermitian ) in heisenberg picture with respect to the original hamiltonian , while for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 we add the choice - dependent hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we can assign @xmath17 for null passive choice , @xmath18 , meaning only internal system s dynamics without changes due to active choices , @xmath19 . in field theory , it is convenient to define free field , e.g. @xmath20 controlling free choice .",
    "the choice is realised by adding to hamiltonian @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is some local operator .",
    "quantum field theory works equivalently in the lagrangian path integral framework , where we deal with integrals @xmath23 with the local form of @xmath24 and field @xmath25 .",
    "then the local choice can be realized by adding @xmath26 .",
    "relativistic invariant choice means no changes of choice - dependent @xmath24 under lorentz transformations , applied to both @xmath7 and @xmath27 .",
    "we can take @xmath28 for a scalar field and @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 in the case of quantum electrodynamics , with current @xmath32 and potential @xmath33 .      according to wightman axiom @xcite relativistic - invariant lagrangian",
    "should imply invariant quantum correlations of the form @xmath34 where the avrerage is defined @xmath35 , in the normalized , hermitian and positive definite state @xmath36 ( @xmath37 for a pure state ) .",
    "invariance requires lorentz transformation of all @xmath38s and @xmath36 . for free choices the invariance axiom extends to @xmath39",
    "the axiom of invariance is not straightforward to prove in general , except free theories . for interacting theories only in vacuum at zero temperature and perturbatively",
    "it has been shown in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finite temperature states are certainly not invariant themselves which makes the analysis quite hard .",
    "nevertheless , for our purposes the perturbative case of zero temperature is sufficient so we can take the operational invariance for granted .",
    "realism means a construction of observations described by a set of random functions @xmath40 . in usual quantum mechanics",
    "the probability is given by positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite , as @xmath41 with the set of kraus operators @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the use of povm is here both ambiguous and obscure , because no single povm can be reliably distinguished and even if we determine one any calculations will be tedious .",
    "even worse , every povm ( even apparently invariant with respect to relativity ) makes the dynamics disturbed , irreversible , which is a common problem of objective collapse theories @xcite .",
    "here we do not accept such disturbance in objective realism and demand strict noninvasiveness of observations .",
    "irreversibility is still possible due to largeness and openness of the system but not the observations themselves .",
    "a better approach requires the framework of weak measurements @xcite which are a special limit of a povm corresponding to a weakly disturbing observation , so that invasiveness disappears in the limit@xcite .",
    "the price to pay is a large additional gaussian noise convoluted with the internal statistics .",
    "the latter alone must be described by quasiprobability ( sometimes negative , like wigner function @xcite , in contrast to normal probability ) @xmath43 so it is alone insufficient for realism . in standard quantum measurement theory",
    "@xcite , any measurement of finite strength , even weak , leads to some ( although tiny ) disturbance . on the other hand ,",
    "the only perfectly nondisturbing standard quantum measurement is trivial  not measuring anything at all .",
    "therefore , to define noninvasive observations and realism , we will make a step beyond standard measurement .",
    "namely , we take @xmath43 obtained from the noninvasive limit and convolute some extra noise @xmath44 ( but finite ) to lift the negativity , which is possible within experimental regime , discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such a step is that no collapse is necessary at all , while the noise @xmath44 reduces the observations to standard projections for sufficiently macroscopic observation ( when the noise @xmath44 becomes irrelevant ) . in this way we stay as close to standard measurement as possible , yet",
    "preserve noninvasiveness .",
    "this is consistent e.g. with condensed matter approach to quantum noise @xcite .",
    "the real probability @xmath45 of an observable @xmath46 localized in spacetime and choice - dependent is expected in form @xmath47=n\\ast q=\\int \\mathrm{d}o '   n[o']q(o - o').\\label{conv}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is an external noise ( positive probability ) and @xmath43 is an internal quasiprobability .",
    "the main point of this work is check if such a construction is possible to include free choice .",
    "namely , all readouts will be choice - conditioned , e.g. @xmath48 .",
    "this means that readouts for all choices , also those not just realized , are measurable .",
    "one can extend this idea naturally to continuous fields and choices , and then @xmath49 $ ] is a function of @xmath50 and functional of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that @xmath44 is independent choice and state of the system .",
    "otherwise we would have additional choice - controlled dynamics . in that case",
    "we will rather incorporate all such dependence in the quantum description alone .",
    "this is a reasonable minimalist approach , where quantum mechanics essentially captures all the dynamics .",
    "the quasiprobability statistics can be conveniently written in the form for correlations @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes time ordering , with respect to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the superoperators @xmath55 @xcite act on any operator @xmath56 as an anticommutator / commutator : @xmath57 and @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "alternatively @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath63 is in principle arbitrary but it turns out that only two choices are reasonable , in particular @xmath64 ( no memory ) @xcite or @xmath65 ( no correlations in zero temperature equilibrium ) @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath38 are given in heisenberg picture including the free part governed by the field @xmath7 .",
    "i principle in ( [ avgabs ] ) one could define correlations for different @xmath7 and @xmath66 ( or more ) but they are not directly measurable . for our goal",
    "it is sufficient to consider a single @xmath7 .    in quantum field theory , the above can be written in term of path integrals , namely @xmath67 with lagrangian density @xmath24 and integration over @xmath68 along keldysh - kadanoff - baym contour @xcite , fig .",
    "[ kel]a , where the state is described by proper defining @xmath24 and the path of @xmath68 before the earliest @xmath68 with an active choice or observation .",
    "for instance a thermal state of temperature @xmath69 means simply extending @xmath68 to complex values with a jump of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 , becomes @xmath72 at @xmath73 ) as shown in fig.[kel]b .",
    "it is important to discriminate between forward , @xmath74 and backward , @xmath75 , times @xmath76 , respectively , with @xmath77 ( spatial position unaffected ) . in such description @xmath78 and time order",

    "free field @xmath79 is the the same for forward and backward time .    .",
    "the shape of the left line is arbitrary .",
    "the time window for observations is bounded by the horizontal part ]    to proceed with the problem of relativistic invariant realism , we have to recall the relativistic framework",
    ". we shall use standard relativistic quantum field notation with fourvectors @xmath31 ( e.g. field ) , @xmath80 ( position in spacetime ) and flat metric @xmath81 , summation convention and index shifting @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 derivatives @xmath85 . along the keldysh contour",
    "we parametrize @xmath86 by real @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we shall often switch to momentum or fourier space with @xmath90 which needs to specify @xmath50 either along @xmath91 or @xmath92 part",
    ". then the equilibrium @xmath63 corresponds to which gives fourier transform @xmath93 @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath95 for spacelike @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "it essentially means @xmath98 for spacelike @xmath96 or @xmath64 and @xmath99 for the other @xmath63 and timelike @xmath96 , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath43 follows then from the wightman axiom ( [ frein ] ) , so it remains to check if @xmath44 also can be invariant .",
    "for a simple convolution with positive @xmath44 makes it impossible to construct relativistic invariant realism even without free choice , because of zero - temperature counterexamples @xcite .",
    "however we can avoid the zero - temperature problems by simply subtracting zero - temperature statistics .",
    "it can be achieved in the following way .",
    "the convolution ( [ conv ] ) is equivalent to a simple sum of generating functions , namely @xmath102=s_n[\\chi]+s_q[\\chi],\\:\\rme^{s_x[\\chi]}=\\int do x[o]\\exp\\int\\rmi\\rmd^4x o(x)\\chi(x)\\label{choice}\\ ] ] generating functions can be used as a formal series with cumulant expansion in @xmath103 , e.g. @xmath104 with cumulants @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , etc .",
    "there is 1 - 1 correspondence between cumulants e.g. @xmath111 and moments @xmath112 up to a given @xmath113 , the order of cumulants / moments .",
    "we assume that only cumulants / moments up to a given order are interesting .",
    "it is reasonable because ( a ) high order cumulants / moments are cumbersome to calculate and ( b ) for almost all practical purposes it is sufficient to consider only low order moments ( e.g. tests of locality or contextuality @xcite ) . instead of full form of @xmath44",
    "we can only take @xmath114 and even split into some pieces , e.g. @xmath115 . for any positive probability",
    "the second cumulant @xmath116 must be positive . however , this is only necessary only for the sum of all pieces , including @xmath117 . for a sufficiently large second order cumulants ( correlations )",
    "real positive probability @xmath45 can constructed when known cumulants up to a given order @xcite .",
    "therefore we can postulate arbitrary forms of @xmath118 , as long as the overall @xmath119 corresponds to a positive probability , in particular second order correlations .",
    "we shall take one particular piece @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the quantum generating function of the zero - temperature vacuum .",
    "this will get rid of any zero - temperature counterexamples , because we get null statistics @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "certain problems arise at nonzero temperature , as in the following example : quantum electrodynamics current - current correlation @xmath124 the function @xmath125 must be positive",
    ". it will be indeed true for @xmath97 ( spacelike ) , because the vacuum contribution vanishes and the non - zero - temperature one must be positive .",

    "we have @xmath128 for @xmath129 in the case of @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath64 .",
    "due to unitarity , we have @xmath132 for every @xmath133 and @xmath134 which means that we can subtract @xmath135 to get @xmath136 for @xmath64 . in terms of fields",

    "therefore @xmath125 is positive definite for spacelike @xmath96 but negative definite for timelike @xmath96 with @xmath173 and zero for @xmath174 . to fix the problem of positivity we need to add another @xmath175 with positive definite correlation for @xmath100 . to this end",

    "at low temperatures ( large @xmath189 ) it vanishes exponentially at least @xmath190 but the same behavior applies to all correlation functions .",

    "the invariance condition is that , in the limit of zero temperature , they stay invariant under simultaneous change the frame for @xmath25 , @xmath7 , @xmath194 and @xmath33 , according to lorentz rules . to show that this is impossible , we take @xmath7 and @xmath33 as small parameters and expand all correlations in their powers , e.g. @xmath195 certainly @xmath196 corresponds to the zero - temperature vacuum limit of the previous case .",
    "we have already learned that @xmath197 for spacelike @xmath96 ( or @xmath198 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is sufficiently small so that we can perform perturbative analysis , comparing correlations expanded to the same maximal power of @xmath7 .",

    "the expectations will also contain @xmath209 .",
    "we can e.g. vertices of regular tetrahedron , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 . then only the term @xmath205 will contribute , which is at zero temperature @xmath215^{-1}\\ ] ] which is @xmath216 for the tetrahedron . on the other hand realism requires cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath217 with regularization @xmath218 . however , the left hand side is nonzero and proportional to @xmath219 while on the right hand side @xmath220 disappears if , for @xmath221 , @xmath222 is spacelike for all integer @xmath223 and the inequality is obviously violated in zero temperature vacuum . note that the example has no proper classical limit , at least at zero temperature .",
    "this is because time - resolved observation is burdened with time - frequency uncertainty and even the simple vacuum fluctuations ( zero - point quantum noise ) do not contain planck constant ( tracing back dimension ) and the only comparison scale is the mass of a ( charged ) particle , which is combined with planck constant and speed of light to get frequency dimension .",
    "it is interesting to understand why there is no contribution from @xmath221 .",
    "let us expand @xmath224 the zero order term vanishes because @xmath225 are spacelike and arguments analogous as in @xcite and the second one from parity .",
    "the remaining @xmath226 corresponds to @xmath227 . from unitarity",
    "we add @xmath228 which leaves only terms @xmath229 and @xmath230 so @xmath96 and @xmath231 lie on the opposite branches of keldysh contour .",
    "they are spacelike , also with added @xmath232 , so there is no possibility to go between branches ",
    "there is always @xmath233 from @xmath91 to @xmath92 so the sum of all transfer variables @xmath234s , must be timelike but also equal @xmath96 , @xmath235 or @xmath236 , contradiction .",
    "the argument extends analogously to higher orders with the restriction that the sum @xmath237 can not become timelike .",
    "however , instead of showing that ( [ ppp ] ) vanishes , it is sufficient to show that it is at least @xmath238 .    alternatively , we can use a generalized form of quantum fluctuation theorem for thermal states @xcite , namely @xmath239 where @xmath240 denotes time reversal of fields and lagrangian , here @xmath241 , @xmath242 , with @xmath243 and @xmath244 for @xmath245 .",

    "an analogous example involves current , namely @xmath253 at free choice @xmath254 .",
    "then ( [ pp1 ] ) for spacelike @xmath255 takes the form @xmath256 which is a four - point green function discussed long time ago @xcite .",

    "let us take @xmath258 and again vertices of regular tetrahedron .",
    "then @xmath259 which is clearly nonzero , contradicting an analogue of ( [ csch ] ) because @xmath260 will be zero ( or @xmath261 , zeroth order vanishes as shown in @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that an attempt to build free choice into quantum mechanics fails when trying to reconcile with relativity .",
    "if we abandon relativistic invariance we can make @xmath220 positive for every @xmath96 , not only timelike .",
    "the failure is generic as it occurs both for scalar and vector ( spinor ) fields .",
    "one of consequences of relativistic invariance is the principle of no - signaling .",
    "it states that the correlations @xmath262 can not depend on free choices @xmath263 localized at @xmath264 so that @xmath265 is spacelike for all @xmath266 . plainly , it forbids superluminal , faster than light , communication .",
    "it is justified by relativistic invariance of correlations because the influence associated with @xmath267 is associated with @xmath268 . because @xmath269 is spacelike",
    ", we can find a frame where @xmath270 when @xmath271 so @xmath268 gets eliminated .",
    "as already stressed , the invariance itself can be proved at least perturbatively @xcite but it is rather accepted as part of wightman axioms ( [ frein ] ) , which in fact state both invariance ( of the vaccuum ground state ) and no - signaling , also called microcausality . however , once relativistic invariance is put in doubt , no - signaling loses its obvious justification .",
    "one can still ask if adding non - invariant corrections to an invariant theory may lead to the violation of no - signaling .",
    "we shall demonstrate that indeed it can be violated but non - perturbatively while perturbative approach is misleading .",
    "let us look at a counterexample , depicted in fig .",
    "let us take a real scalar field @xmath25 with the lagrangian density analogous to ( [ fre ] ) @xmath272 it is clear that the signaling speed is @xmath3 and the causal green function ( commutator ) @xmath273 can be written @xcite @xmath274 with @xmath77 and can be evaluated exactly as @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the bessel function .",
    "in quantum field theory we need to subtract renormalizing green function with a large mass @xmath277 giving effectively @xmath278 the green function is not zero only inside the causal cone given by @xmath279 defining the signaling speed as @xmath3 .",
    "now , let us solve the problem perturbatively , rewriting @xmath280 where @xmath281 is a ( small ) perturbative parameter .",
    "perturbative solution leads to changing @xmath3 at constant @xmath50 and reads @xmath282 while for negative @xmath192 and @xmath283 we substitute @xmath284 , an analytic continuation at @xmath285 .",
    "this is of course different from the exact solution and the reason is that the boundary of signaling cone limits the validity of perturbative expansion .",

    "the geometric series is convergent only at @xmath288 , despite leading to a finite contribution at each order of @xmath192 . beyond convergence region",
    ", summation is only formal and interpreted rather as analytic continuation .",
    "therefore , this reasoning is certainly nonperturbative . in principle",
    "one could include analytic continuation of such a series in one of the rules of quantum field theory , all dangerous examples in interacting theories , e.g. bound states and higher order correlation functions , are impossible to check .",
    "we conclude that no - signaling is a nonperturbative principle inherently related to relativistic invariance .",
    "this means that relativistic invariance may be renounced either by a direct experiment in different frames @xcite or indirectly by testing no - signaling .    , bounding blue area .",
    "starting from a field with signaling velocity @xmath5 ( bounding red area ) with perturbative expansion the boundary of signaling remains the same ( read area ) . ]",

    "although in recent experiments @xcite the signature of superluminal signaling based of the reported data seems to be insignificant , in all of them both random choices and readouts are machine - made so fair time tagging and choice is a matter of trust in electronics , not humans  the choice is not free in human sense @xcite .",
    "further and improved experiments should be continued to resolve the question of possible superluminal signaling .",
    "the presented conflicts of freedom of choice in quantum realism with relativity demonstrates incompleteness of the present quantum framework . the easiest way would be to abandon relativistic invariance",
    "this can be tested experimentally , especially by no - signaling in test of local realism , which is different from direct search for violations of relativistic invariance @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental development of such tests is critical for finding a way to reconciliate quantum realism with free choices .",
    "finally , the freedom of choice remains a matter of trust in electronics , with human choice yet to be considered @xcite .",

    "the calculation of @xmath293 by standard methods ( wick decomposition into propagators  two - point green functions ) reduces to 3 integrals ( differing by permutation ) , corresponding to the box feynman diagram depicted in fig .",

    "it is important that @xmath125 ( not @xmath69 ) invariant with respect of permutation of pairs @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 , relativistic invariant and gauge invariant , namely @xmath302 ( and analogously for other pairs ) .",
    "it is easily prove by the identity @xmath303 used at every occurrence of @xmath304 and telescoping cancellation of the left hand sides from all parts of the integral , with a shift of @xmath96 when appropriate",

    "@xmath309 are equal some of @xmath308 but from the condition @xmath310 we can exclude @xmath7 from @xmath200 , @xmath311 from @xmath198 , @xmath3 from @xmath240 , @xmath312 from @xmath87 ( by substituting @xmath313 etc . ) . from gauge invariance",
    "the heads determine all other terms , because the terms with @xmath314 can not exist without heads .",
    "it is clear when e.g. we combine @xmath306 with @xmath315 , which gives @xmath316 . without heads this term can be canceled only by @xmath317 or @xmath318 .",
    "this is impossible if @xmath319 . by interchanging @xmath320",
    "we find that @xmath321 must correspond to @xmath322 or @xmath323 .",
    "however , then @xmath317 implies @xmath324 and @xmath318 implies @xmath325 which again makes the cancellation impossible .",
    "terms @xmath307 left alone have nothing to cancel with .",
    "heads can be classified into 6 types : @xmath326 depicted in fig .",
    "[ heads ] .",
    "gauge invariance should allow to write @xmath328 in terms of fields @xmath329 or in fourier representation @xmath330 ( similarly for @xmath331 ) . in each combination",
    "we get some heads there are plenty of possible types combinations of fields that may contribute to @xmath332 but we shall classify 5 of them ( the only relevant as we shall see in the end ) with corresponding heads in @xmath125 .",
    "we shall use compact notation , @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "the list is @xmath335 it is clear the the type number matches the head type except head type 6 which contributes to 3 and 4 here .",
    "the tensor 5 is a simplified form of that of @xcite due to bianchi identity @xmath336 .    to continue calculation , we rewrite in ( [ ttt ] ) @xmath337 and analogously other factors .",
    "then we use feynman identity @xmath338 applied to @xmath339 , @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 . moreover , we make shift @xmath343 . using the fact @xmath310 and @xmath344 we can rewrite ( [ ttt ] ) in the form @xmath345 where @xmath43 is equal @xmath346 and @xmath347 in heads we need four factors of @xmath308 so , for their determination , we can drop @xmath96 and @xmath126 in the numerator .",
    "then we can perform the trace in the numerator , leaving only heads .",
    "we can drop @xmath96 because it can not appear in heads as from relativistic invariance we have @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "we get the head part of the trace in ( [ tt1 ] ) in the form @xmath350 @xmath351 expanding the above expression we can find all heads .",

    "we also find that heads 5 appear in antisymmetric pairs , e.g. @xmath354 and @xmath355 depicted in fig .",
    "[ hour ] .      to show that only tensors in ( [ ten ] ) appear in @xmath332 note that : ( a ) we can take away heads 1 and 2 by tensors 1 and 2 leaving the rest invariant , ( b ) heads 3 and 4",

    "therefore we only have to show that heads 5 alone must combine to the tensor 5 .",
    "let us focus first focus on a subgroup of these heads @xmath358 multiplied by @xmath312 cycles @xmath359 must get canceled from gauge invariance , which can not be done by terms with @xmath314 ( @xmath312 will appear ) or other groups ( we can not get the same cycles ) . hence @xmath360 and we can rewrite the group multiplied by @xmath361 in the form @xmath362 . which corresponds to a combination of tensors 5 .      at small values or @xmath308 we can neglect @xmath43 in the denominator of ( [ tt2 ] ) .",
