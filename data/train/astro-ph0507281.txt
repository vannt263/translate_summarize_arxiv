    "understanding the formation history of stellar halos is one of the classical pursuits of galactic astronomy .",
    "the problem is generally framed within the context of two competing scenarios : one of `` rapid collapse '' ( eggen , lynden  bell & sandage 1962 ) , in which the stellar halo is formed by the rapid collapse of a proto  galaxy within a dynamical timescale ( @xmath0  10@xmath1  yr ) , and one of `` galactic assembly '' @xcite , whereby the stellar halo is assembled on a longer timescale ( @xmath0  10@xmath2  yr ) by the accretion of `` building ",
    "blocks '' , each with separate enrichment histories .",
    "both scenarios have their strengths and weaknesses , and it would appear that a hybrid model is the most plausible option consistent with extant data ( e.g. : @xcite ; @xcite ) .    an intriguing piece of the halo formation `` puzzle '' is provided by comparing the stellar halo of our own milky way with that of its neighbour , m31 .",
    "first , despite their comparable total galactic luminosities , the stellar halo of m31 is _ apparently _ much more metal  rich than that of the milky way ( e.g. : @xcite ; @xcite ; durrell , harris & pritchet 2001 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the halo of m31 bears a closer resemblance to that of ngc  5128 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , despite their differing morphological classifications .    the stellar halo ",
    "galaxy formation symbiosis has been further brought to light by the recent work of mouhcine et al .",
    "( see also tikhonov , galazutdinova & drozdovsky 2005 ) . the deep hubble space telescope ( hst hereafter ) imaging of nearby spiral galaxy stellar halos in @xcite suggests a significant correlation between stellar halo metallicity and total galactic luminosity . on the surface",
    ", this correlation appears to leave our own milky way s halo as an outlier with respect to other spirals , with a stellar halo metallicity @xmath01  dex lower than spirals of comparable luminosity ( such as m31 , as alluded to earlier ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that the metallicity of the galactic halo in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. , in ryan & norris 1991 ) comes from spectroscopic metallicities in a kinematically  selected sample , whereas that of the m31 halo , as well as those of the stellar halos of nearby spiral galaxies @xcite , have been derived primarily from photometric metallicities in geographically  selected samples . because it is now becoming possible to obtain spectroscopic metallicities for significant samples of kinematically  selected giants in the m31 halo ( e.g. : @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", it will be crucial to assess the consistency of the m31 stellar halo metallicity as derived from kinematically and from geographically  selected samples , respectively .    a grasp of the true scatter around the general trend in the halo metallicity ",
    "luminosity relation awaits a larger observational data set , however any theory which attempts to explain such a relation needs to simultaneously account for the _ apparent _ metallicity discrepancy between the milky way and the andromeda stellar halos .",
    "the question arises as to what is driving the scatter of halo metallicity for galaxies of comparable luminosity ?    in what follows , we investigate whether differences in the stellar halo assembly history can explain the diversity seen in halo metallicities . using chemo ",
    "dynamical numerical simulations , we have constructed a sample of 89 model disc galaxies , spanning @xmath04  magnitudes in luminosity , and sampling a wide range of assembly histories at a given luminosity ( or mass ) .",
    "we contrast the derived stellar halo metallicity  galactic luminosity relation with the recent empirical determination of @xcite .",
    "the numerical framework in which the simulations have been conducted is described in section  2 , while sections  3 and 4 present the results and the related discussion , respectively .",
    "the simulations employed here are patterned after the semi  cosmological adiabatic feedback model of @xcite , and were constructed using the chemo  dynamical code gcd+ @xcite .",
    "gcd+ self  consistently treats the effects of gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , star formation , and chemical enrichment ( including type  ii and ia supernovae , relaxing the instantaneous recycling approximation ) .",
    "this semi ",
    "cosmological version of ` gcd+ ` is based on the seminal work of @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for a given model is an isolated sphere of dark matter and gas .",
    "this `` top  hat '' overdensity has an amplitude @xmath3 at initial redshift @xmath4 , which is approximately related to the collapse redshift @xmath5 by @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we set @xmath7 , which determines @xmath3 at @xmath8 .",
    "small  scale density fluctuations based on a cdm power spectrum are superimposed on the sphere using ` cosmics ` ( @xcite ) , and the amplitude of the fluctuations is parameterised by @xmath9 .",
    "these fluctuations are the seeds for local collapse and subsequent star formation .",
    "body rotation corresponding to a spin parameter @xmath10 is imparted to the initial sphere to incorporate the effects of longer wavelength fluctuations . for the flat cdm model described here ,",
    "the relevant parameters include @xmath11 , baryon fraction @xmath12 , @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , spin parameter @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we employed 14147 dark matter and 14147 gas / star particles , for the 89 simulations presented here .    using the same number of particles , collapse redshift @xmath17 , and",
    "spin parameter @xmath10 , a series of 89 simulations were completed spanning a factor of 50 in mass in four separate mass `` bins '' : m@xmath18 = 1@xmath1910@xmath20  m@xmath21 ; 5@xmath1910@xmath20  m@xmath21 ; 1@xmath1910@xmath22  m@xmath21 ; 5@xmath1910@xmath22  m@xmath21 . for each total mass , we run models with different patterns of small  scale density fluctuations which lead to different hierarchical assembly histories .",
    "this was controlled by setting different random seeds for the gaussian perturbation generator in cosmics .",
    "our grid of 89 simulations were employed to populate the redshift @xmath23 = 0 stellar halo metallicity  luminosity plane ( i.e. @xmath24[fe / h]@xmath25  m@xmath26 ) shown in fig .  1 ( filled symbols[fe / h]@xmath25 , which is the source of the apparently `` quantised '' centroid values in fig .  1 . ] ) .",
    "we have been conservative in our geometrical definition of `` stellar halo '' , adopting a projected cut  off radius of 15  kpc to delineate the halo from ( possible ) disc  bulge contaminants .",
    "such a choice should also allow an easier comparison with the observations of halo fields in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "the stellar metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) was then generated using all stellar particles from the halo `` region '' , convolved with a gaussian of @xmath27@xmath28}$ ] = 0.15  dex , representing the typical observational uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "68% of the stellar particles within a given ( simulated ) mdf typically span 1.4  dex in metallicity .",
    "we confirmed that the derived halo mdfs are insensitive to projection effects , even in the most massive ( largest ) models , suggesting that our @xmath29  15  kpc definition for the halo `` region '' is sufficient for minimising disc and bulge contamination .",
    "the optical properties of our simulated stellar populations were derived using the population synthesis models of @xcite , taking into account the age and the metallicity of each stellar particle .",

    "1 is that significant variation in halo metallicity ( @xmath311  dex ) exists at any given total galactic luminosity in our simulations . for a set of models with the same initial total mass , the only difference among these models",
    "can be traced to the random pattern of initial small - scale density fluctuations ; this translates directly into differing hierarchical assembly histories .",
    "qualitiatively , it would appear that assembly history alone may account for the diversity in halo metallicity at a given galactic luminosity , and thus account for the apparent outliers in the observed trend .     for the simulations with @xmath32 = 10@xmath22 m@xmath33 .",

    "these representative models demonstrate that the simulated galaxies with the more metal  rich halos are assembled over a longer timescale , and thus possess a broader adf ( both in the halo and in the associated galaxy ) .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the evidence , presented by @xcite , of a substantial intermediate - age metal - rich population in a geographically - selected halo field of m31 .",
    "conversely , the simulated galaxies with the more metal  poor halos are assembled earlier through more of a monolithic process , with a consequently narrower adf .",

    "the issue of model convergence ( resolution ) is always a concern when interpreting cosmological simulations ( particularly when including baryons ) .",

    "stellar mass plane are underpopulated by the lower  resolution models ( middle panels of fig .  4 ) .",
    "we have presented here an analysis of the characteristics of spiral galaxy stellar halos formed within a large grid of numerical simulations , with particular emphasis placed upon the relationship between stellar halo metallicity and the associated galactic luminosity .",
    "we have demonstrated that at any given total luminosity ( or , conversely , total dynamical mass ) , the metallicities of these simulated stellar halos span a range in excess of @xmath0  1  dex .",
    "we suggest that the underlying driver of this metallicity spread can be traced to the diversity of galactic mass assembly histories inherent within the hierarchical clustering paradigm .",
    "galaxies with a more protracted assembly history possess more metal  rich and younger stellar halos , with an associated greater dispersion in age , than galaxies which experience more of a monolithic collapse .",
    "for a given total luminosity ( or dynamical mass ) , those galaxies with more extended assembly histories also possess more massive stellar halos , which in turn leads to a direct correlation between a stellar halo s metallicity and its surface brightness ( as anticipated by earlier semi  analytical models - e.g. , @xcite ) . by extension ,",
    "such a correlation may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool for disentangling the formation history of disc galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented an observed correlation between stellar halo metallicity and total galactic luminosity , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the observed dispersion in the mean halo metallicity at a given galactic luminosity is _ smaller _ than what we find in our simulations .",
    "_ however _ the latter can account for the outliers in the observed trend . since our motivation has been to study which is the effect of the pattern of the initial density fluctuations _",
    "alone _ on the stellar halo features at redshift zero in simulated spiral galaxies , it is worth to note that galaxy formation , as it is observed , is an ongoing process which is the result of the interplay among different parameters , of which the pattern of initial density fluctuations ( thus the merging history ) is one .",
    "we have shown that the merging history _ alone _ may be held responsible of the dispersion in halo metallicity at a comparable total galactic luminosity , as _ apparently _ observed for example in our milky way and in andromeda ( see section  1 ) .",
    "this begs the question ... _which is normal _ ?",
    "our study suggests that if the stellar halo was assembled ( primarily ) through more of a monolithic collapse , such a low metallicity is indeed what should be expected ; conversely , the fact that the m31 stellar halo is significantly metal  rich is suggestive of a more protracted assembly history .",
    "an observational consequence of these differing formation histories is the prediction that the m31 stellar halo should possess a high surface brightness ; observations tentatively support this prediction ( reitzel , guhathakurta & gould 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further observations are needed to tighten our grasp of the strength and scatter of the stellar halo metallicity ",
