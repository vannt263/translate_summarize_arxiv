    "the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( sqm ) , introduced by witten @xcite in 1981 , provides an elegant way to construct a hierarchy of hamiltonians with well defined relations between their spectra @xcite .",
    "specifically , it allows the elimination or introduction of bound states @xcite without altering the remaining part of the spectrum .",
    "transformations of sqm , which we will refer to as supersymmetric ( susy ) transformations , are specific darboux transformations @xcite of the schrdinger equation and are related to the factorization method @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is a close connection to inverse scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the susy - transformations of the radial schrdinger equation have been studied in detail @xcite . in particular emphasis",
    "was given to mathematical aspects as well as applications to specific physics phenomena .",
    "an important application is the relationship of equivalent effective interactions between composite particle systems . in such systems , because of the necessary suppression of the internal degrees of freedom , the resulting interactions are ambiguous @xcite .",
    "there is always a set of effective interactions leading to the same scattering phase shifts which sustain , however , a different number of additional unphysical bound states as a consequence of simulating differently the pauli principle .",
    "baye @xcite pointed out that sqm is an elegant way to construct such phase equivalent potentials .",
    "since then , more general transformations of the radial schrdinger equation for uncoupled channels have been worked out @xcite which , apart from a simple removal and an addition of a ground state , allow arbitrary modifications of the bound state spectrum @xcite .",
    "the concept of susy  transformations has been extended to coupled  channel systems by amado _",
    "@xcite but their transformations do not allow the construction of phase - equivalent potentials after the removal of a bound state @xcite .",
    "recently , sparenberg and baye @xcite addressed this problem and presented susy  transformations for coupled  channel systems which in addition to the removal of bound states allow the construction of phase - equivalent potentials .",
    "however , the status of susy - transformations for coupled - channel systems is still incomplete because the process of introducing a bound state has not been considered so far . in this article",
    "we present a susy  transformation for the introduction of @xmath0 degenerate bound states in a system of @xmath0 coupled channels .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 coupled channels which is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath6 is an @xmath7 matrix that may include the centrifugal barrier and thresholds which may be different in each channel . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the mass @xmath8 is equal for all channels ( for unequal masses , see ref .",
    "the wave function @xmath9 is an @xmath7 matrix , where each column vector @xmath10 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "the susy transformations are based on the factorization of the hamiltonian @xmath11 where the energy @xmath12 is smaller than or equal to the ground state @xmath13 of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the superpotential @xmath16 is an @xmath7 matrix satisfying the differential equation @xmath17 the supersymmetric partner hamiltonian @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 the solutions of the corresponding schrdinger equation , at any energy @xmath20 , are directly given in terms of @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "the above equations are formally equivalent to those for uncoupled channels for which the susy transformations are known in closed form @xcite . in the present work we consider a susy transformation for coupled  channel systems generated via the ansatz @xmath23^{-1 } \\psi_0^{-1}(\\bar \\epsilon , r )",
    "\\nonumber \\ ] ] where we have used the hermiticity @xcite of the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susynew ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath7 matrix @xmath24 must be symmetric and should be chosen in such a way that @xmath16 has no singularities for @xmath25 .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susynew ] ) is a straightforward extension of the simplest expression for the superpotential in uncoupled systems .",
    "the superpotential ( [ eq : susynew ] ) can also be put in the simplest form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is now the most general solution of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the associated transformation depends on the choice of @xmath28 , the integration bound @xmath29 , and the constant matrix @xmath24 . in the present work we are concerned with choices that lead to the addition of a bound state .    for an energy @xmath30",
    ", it turns out that the regular solution of @xmath14 together with the bound @xmath31 is the appropriate choice .",
    "then the transformed wave function @xmath32 at the energy @xmath33 , is simply given by @xmath34^{-1}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : bound}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regular solutions @xmath27 , at energies below the lowest ground state energy of @xmath14 , exhibit a diverging behavior for @xmath35 .",
    "hence , all columns of @xmath36 are exponentially vanishing solutions of @xmath18 at asymptotic distances . furthermore @xmath36 is bounded ( for @xmath37 ) if @xmath38 which is the case when the matrix @xmath24 is chosen negative semidefinite .",
    "this guarantees also that @xmath39 is bounded except for @xmath40 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath36 at @xmath41 requires more attention as it depends on the coupled  channel system considered . specifically , if the singularity of the potential at the origin is of the form @xmath42 with the same @xmath43 for all channels , one obtains the behavior @xmath44 .",
    "hence , for @xmath45 the function @xmath46 vanishes at the origin and with an appropriate choice of @xmath24 , satisfying ( [ eq : det ] ) , each column vector of @xmath36 corresponds to a bound state of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the transformation associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : susynew ] ) enables us to add @xmath0 degenerate bound states to the spectrum of @xmath14 at the energy @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , analytical examples show that the degeneracy at @xmath47 seems to depend on the rank of the matrix @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath48 the function @xmath36 does not correspond to bound states",
    "the situation becomes even more intriguing , when the potential exhibits different singularities in the coupled channels , i.e. @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "it can be shown that if the coupling vanishes near the origin , the @xmath51th component of each column vector of @xmath36 behaves as @xmath52 there and leads , with an appropriate choice of @xmath24 , to the addition of up to @xmath0 degenerate bound states to the spectrum of @xmath14 .    for a nonvanishing coupling near the origin and different",
    "@xmath49 the behavior of @xmath36 near the origin can not be given in closed form .",
    "therefore , definite conclusions about the number of bound states that can be added are difficult to draw . however , the numerical examples discussed below demonstrate that the transformation ( [ eq : bound ] ) can also lead , in the general case , to the addition of up to @xmath0 degenerate bound states .",
    "the susy transformation generated by @xmath16 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susynew ] ) modifies , similarly to the single channel case , the s - matrix @xcite . to compensate this ,",
    "another transformation is required which is associated with a superpotential that has the opposite sign at asymptotic distances @xcite .",
    "therefore we first perform a transformation generated by the simple superpotential ( first term of eq . ( [ eq : susynew ] ) ) using asymptotically vanishing solutions @xmath53 of the schrdinger equation with @xmath14 [ @xmath54 @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an @xmath7 matrix ] .",
    "the existence of the transformed potential requires a non - vanishing determinant of @xmath53 for all finite @xmath57-values .",
    "this can always be satisfied because @xmath12 is assumed to be smaller than the deepest bound state of @xmath14 .",
    "the first susy transformation modifies the s - matrix but does not change the number of bound states . in a second step",
    "we transform @xmath18 via the transformation mediated by the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susynew ] ) .",
    "a direct verification shows that @xmath58 is a regular solution of @xmath18 .",
    "we use this solution to construct the superpotential of the second transformation , following the principle of the preceding section .",
    "the potential @xmath59 resulting from the two successive transformations , as well as the corresponding solution @xmath60 , can be expressed in terms of the solutions of the initial equation only .",
    "they read @xmath61 and @xmath62 \\ , , \\label{psi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath63^{-1 } \\label{chi}\\ ] ] corresponds to the added bound state(s ) of @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is a constant @xmath7 matrix .",
    "this procedure transforms a regular solution @xmath27 into a regular solution @xmath60 as long as the singularity at the origin is sufficiently strong ( @xmath66 ) . in this case the new potential @xmath59 is phase equivalent to @xmath67 [ eq .",
    "( [ psi2 ] ) shows that both @xmath27 and @xmath60 have the same asymptotic behaviour , up to a normalization factor , which confirms phase equivalence ] , and sustains ( besides the bound states of @xmath14 ) up to @xmath0 additional bound states at @xmath12 .",
    "similarly to the single susy transformation , discussed in the previous section , the degeneracy of the introduced bound states at @xmath12 can be controlled by the number of non - vanishing eigenvalues of the constant @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "as a demonstration we consider an @xmath68 two - channel system without threshold and a potential of gau form , @xmath69 , with @xmath70fm , @xmath71mev and the depths @xmath72mev , @xmath73mev , and @xmath74mev .",
    "this potential does not sustain a bound state .",
    "a pair of degenerate bound states at @xmath75mev has been introduced using the twice iterated susy transformation .",
    "the new potentials are shown in fig.1 together with the corresponding wave functions of the two added bound states .",
    "it is seen that there is a clear spatial separation between the two degenerate states which is also reflected in the potential matrix .",
    "choosing @xmath24 of rank one results in the introduction of only one bound state at @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to the potential and bound state wave functions displayed in fig.2 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the potentials of fig.1 and fig.2 are phase equivalent .",
    "the introduction of bound states via the twice iterated susy transformation ( [ u2]-[chi ] ) is also possible for systems where channels with different quantum numbers of orbital angular momentum are coupled . of particular interest is the coupling of an s - channel ( @xmath76 ) and a d - channel ( @xmath77 ) when the associated potential has only in the d - channel an @xmath78-singularity at the origin . in such a system",
    "the strength of the singularity suffices for the introduction of one additional bound state via the susy transformation ( [ u2]-[chi ] ) .",
    "the transformed potential has no @xmath79 singularity at the origin which , taking into account the centrifugal term of the d - channel explicitly , implies an attractive @xmath78-contribution to the residual potential .",
    "we have verified this special case numerically assuming the previous two - channel system with slight modifications , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this system has a bound state at @xmath82  mev .",
    "the introduction of an additional bound state at @xmath83  mev leads to the potential and bound state wave function displayed in fig.3 .",
    "the transformed potential confirms the previous discussion and its phase equivalence has been verified numerically . on the contrary , for a @xmath24 matrix of rank 2",
    ", we have verified that the final potential is not phase equivalent to @xmath67 .    as a realistic example we consider the @xmath1s@xmath2-@xmath1d@xmath2 partial waves of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) system which are coupled by a tensor potential that sustains a single physical bound state at @xmath84mev ( the deuteron ) . within the quark model",
    "the nn force is an effective interaction of a composite particle system and may give rise to pauli  forbidden states which are simulated by deep _",
    "unphysical _ bound states in local potential models @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite were the first to use the concept of forbidden states for the nn potential . a more detailed study led to the well known moscow potential which reproduces the scattering data up to @xmath85mev @xcite .",
    "elimination of the additional unphysical bound state via the twice iterated susy transformation of sparenberg and baye @xcite leads to a phase equivalent potential having a close similarity to the standard nn interactions derived in the meson - exchange picture .",
    "qualitatively the same result has been obtained by leeb _",
    "_ @xcite by applying a numerical susy transformation to an early version of the moscow potential .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply the procedure described by eqs .",
    "( [ u2]-[chi ] ) in the opposite direction .",
    "starting from the reid soft core potential ( rsc ) @xcite for the @xmath1s@xmath2-@xmath1d@xmath2 channel , we would like to generate a series of nn potentials of moscow - type where an additional bound state has been introduced at different energies @xmath12 . in fig.4",
    "we show a series of phase equivalent nn ",
    "potentials obtained by this procedure .",
    "variation of the matrix @xmath86 results in modifications of the @xmath57-dependence while the energy of the added bound state is reflected in the depth of the potentials .",
    "the repulsive core of the effective potential @xmath87 is a consequence of the repulsive core of the rsc potential .",
    "it must be emphasized that the obtained potentials are not exactly of the same nature as the moscow potential since the central part of their d - channel component has an @xmath79 attractive core .",
    "in summary , in this work we have presented a closed form expression for a susy transformation which enables us to introduce single or degenerate bound states in a coupled channel system .",
    "the novel transformation works for a general hermitean @xmath0-channel system with and without thresholds .",
    "the method has been successfully tested for the case of two coupled partial waves in the nn system where a whole set of phase equivalent nn potentials of moscow - type has been generated .",
