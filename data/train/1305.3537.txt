    "in spite of steadily increasing data rate demands , cooperative diversity  and most saliently , cooperative relaying  has emerged to a widely - recognized concept to increase reliability and/or throughput through exploration of spatial diversity .",
    "cooperative relaying has gained practical relevance at least since its adoption in the 3gpp rel-10 for 4 g networks @xcite .",
    "taking 4 g as an example , the trend for networks goes toward interference - limitedness as they must cope with heterogeneity / coexistence , densification of devices and sometimes unpredictable deployments @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of cooperative relaying in the presence of random interference is hence mandatory . among the vast body of literature concerning relaying , most prominently @xcite ,",
    "there exist only a limited number of works that take into account the effect of random interference , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in the high reliability regime , the diversity order @xcite metric can be used to measure the increase in robustness against random fluctuations in the channel . in the interference - free scenario ,",
    "this regime is obtained by letting @xmath0 .",
    "practically , this involves scaling the transmit power since the receiver noise can not be lowered to an arbitrary extent .",
    "this observation , however , does not apply to interference - limited multi - user networks since jointly increasing transmit power does not increase the individual sirs .",
    "this gives rise to the question of how to measure the diversity order of cooperative relaying in interference - limited networks appropriately .",
    "we propose a modified diversity order metric , namely _ spatial - contention _ diversity order , which is based on scaling the density of active nodes in the network .",
    "we argue that this modified metric is more suitable for interference - limited networks since the spatial resource  which is considered the critical resource  is taken into account .",
    "also , controlling the density of active transmissions has been understood as an important and effective means to increase network capacity , and is therefore the underlying mechanism of practical mac protocols such as aloha ( spatial reuse with medium access probability ) and csma ( spatial inhibition of active nodes ) .",
    "it is hence worth studying the diversity behavior of cooperative relaying as a function of the density of active nodes . using point process theory",
    ", we derive a stochastic model to study the diversity of cooperative relaying in the presence of random interference .",
    "we aim at answering the following questions : how much diversity can we expect in the interference - limited case ?",
    "how does spatial interference correlation and fading affect the achievable diversity gains ?",
    "to address the key questions of this work , we break the analysis down into a single snapshot of the network , in which a given transmission is interfered by randomly located nodes transmitting in the same time - frequency resource .",
    "the power path loss between two locations @xmath1 is given by the non - singular path loss function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the path loss exponent .",
    "both the correlation and the statistics of the sir strongly depend on the type of channel fading , and particularly on its distribution . since the family of practical fading distributions is large , we focus on two extreme cases : frequency - flat block rayleigh fading and path loss only , the former being usually considered as severe fading while the latter can be seen as the limiting case of weak scatterings .",
    "we consider a three - node configuration which consists of a source located at @xmath4 , a destination located at @xmath5 and a half - duplex relay located at @xmath6 .",
    "the locations @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary but fixed .",
    "hence , we place the destination into the origin ( @xmath7 ) . the block is divided into two consecutive time slots over which the transmission takes place .",
    "selection decode - and - forward ( sdf ) @xcite is used as the relay protocol . in sdf ,",
    "the source broadcasts a packet in the first time slot , while the destination buffers what it receives and the relay tries to decode the packet . depending on whether the relay was able to correctly decode the packet , either the relay or the source",
    "then re - transmits the packet to the destination in the second time slot .",
    "finally , the destination appropriately combines the two copies prior to decoding the packet .",
    "as the three - node configuration is part of a multi - user environment , it will suffer from interference from other transmitters ( interferers ) .",
    "we assume that these interferers are distributed according to a stationary poisson point process ( ppp ) with density @xmath8 .",
    "the ppp assumption is well - accepted for capturing the spatial randomness in contemporary wireless networks of several types @xcite .",
    "formally , we define    rcl : = \\{(_i,_i,_i):_i^2,_i_+,_i_+ } ,    where @xmath9 denotes the random location of the @xmath10-th interferer , while the marks @xmath11 and @xmath12 define the channel fading gain from the @xmath10-th interferer to the relay and the destination , respectively .",
    "all marks are mutually i.i.d . and do not depend on the interferer locations .",
    "the intensity measure of @xmath13 is given by    rcl & & ( a):= _ a _",
    "d(g)_d(h)dx + & & = |a|()(),a^2,_+,_+.[eq : intensity_measure ]    for the path loss only model ( @xmath14 ) , the intensity measure reduces to @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the interference at the relay and at the destination is instead of @xmath16 .",
    "interference is treated as white noise . without loss of generality , we set transmit power to one .",
    "we assume the interference power realizations to remain constant over the two considered time slots . ]",

    ", the sir at the relay is given by    rcl _ & & = ,    where @xmath20 denotes the channel fading gain on the source - relay link .",
    "given that the relay was able to decode successfully , the sir at the destination after optimum combining is    rcl _ & & = ,    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the channel fading gains on the source - destination and relay - destination links , respectively .",
    "when the relay fails to decode correctly , the transmitter re - transmits the packet and the sir at the destination becomes    rcl _ & & = .",
    "when referring to the entire group of fading variables , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we will use the short - hand notation @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .    in many cases",
    "the random fluctuations of the sir can not be tracked by the transmitter due to practical constraints , and particularly because the interference from many nodes can not be known _",
    "a priori_. this may lead to an outage , for which the probability of occurrence is a useful performance metric .",
    "the outage probability ( op ) is defined as    rcl q:= ( < )    for a pre - defined coding / modulation - specific threshold @xmath29 .",

    "motivated by this result , we next focus on the achievable sc - do in the bc - phase only .",
    "in section  [ sec : out_ray ] it was concluded that the sc - do is negatively affected mainly due to the invariability of the interference at the destination in the mac - phase  the relay can not provide diversity w.r.t . the interference .",

    "[ lem : tightness ] the interference tail probability lower bound based on the dominant interferer phenomenon is tight as @xmath65 also for the non - singular path loss law defined in section  [ sec : system_model ] .",
    "we first note that the interference tail probability lower bound based on the maximum interferer principle for the path loss law @xmath64 is tight @xcite .",
    "this is due to the singularity at @xmath66 which renders the interference sub - exponential  by allowing the maximum of the individual interference contributions to dominate the sum interference .",
    "in contrast , the interference in our case is not sub - exponential because of the boundedness of our path loss function .",
    "however , it is intuitive that the interference is nevertheless able to `` make a single relatively big jump '' whenever the close neighborhood of the receiver carries no ( statistical ) weight ; which is the case at small @xmath8 .",

    "this , in turn , renders the dominant - interferer based lower bound tight : when the nearest interferer is not a member of the dominant set ( @xmath70 ) it is likely that no outage occurs since adding the sum interference from the remaining interferers to the maximum interference will most likely not deteriorate the sir much .    using the fact that the dominant - interferer bound is asymptotically tight , we are now able to study the sc - do .",
