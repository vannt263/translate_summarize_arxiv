    "in recent years , the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method has attracted much attention as a powerful tool in direct numerical simulation of fluid flows@xcite .",
    "unlike traditional computational fluid dynamics methods which solve macroscopic governing equations , the lb method employs the discrete boltzmann equation which describes the fluid on the mesoscale level .",
    "this kinetic nature provides the lb method with essential physics .    however , there are also some limitations that restrict the applications of traditional lb method , such as the numerical stability problem , the fixed prandtl number , and so on",
    ". the stability problem has been partly addressed by a number of techniques , such as the entropic method@xcite , flux - limiter@xcite and dissipation@xcite techniques . besides these techniques ,",
    "an effective method is the multiple relaxation time ( mrt ) lb methodhsb,13,duality , which employs multiple relaxation parameters in the collision step , instead of the commonly used single relaxation time ( srt ) collision .",
    "the flexibility gained from the mrt collision can be used to improve the stability property and overcome the fixed prandtl number problem .    to the authors knowledge ,",
    "most of the existing mrt lb models work only for isothermal system@xcite , to cite but a few . to simulate system with temperature field , luo ,",
    "et al.@xcite suggested a hybrid thermal mrt lb model , in which the mass and momentum equations are solved by the mrt model , whereas the diffusion - advection equation for the temperature is solved by finite difference ( fd ) technique or other means .",
    "guo , et al.@xcite proposed a coupling mrt lb model for thermal flows with viscous heat dissipation and compression work .",
    "mezrhab , et al.@xcite proposed a double mrt lb method , where mrt - d2q9 model and the mrt - d2q5 model are used to solve the flow and the temperature fields , respectively .    besides the models mentioned above , we have proposed two mrt finite difference lattice boltzmann models for compressible fluids under shock in previous work@xcite .",
    "numerical experiments showed that compressible flows with strong shocks can be well simulated by these models . in this paper",
