    "half a century ago , budini and fonda  @xcite investigated the threshold singularities in @xmath4 decays and showed that @xmath1 rescattering generates a cusp in the partial decay rate @xmath5 .",
    "the strength of the cusp is determined by the amplitude for the reaction @xmath6 .",
    "budini and fonda provided an analytic formula for the cusp behavior and pointed out that , in principle , this decay allows one to measure the @xmath1 s - wave scattering length @xmath2 , where the @xmath7 denote the scattering lengths of definite isospin @xmath8 .",
    "there were only a handful of @xmath9 decays available in those days , and it was impossible for the authors to actually determine @xmath10 , @xmath3 in this manner .",
    "the method was then forgotten and rediscovered 45  years later by cabibbo in his seminal work  @xcite on the interpretation of the cusp detected in data on @xmath9 decays , collected by the na48/2 collaboration  @xcite .    in the last decade",
    ", spectacular progress has been achieved concerning the knowledge of @xmath1 interactions , in theory as well as in experiment .",
    "as for theory , the scattering lengths were predicted with percent level accuracy  @xcite , [ eq : a0a2 ] a_0=0.2200.005 , a_2=-0.04440.0010 , a_0-a_2=0.2650.004 , within a framework which combines roy equations  @xcite and chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . on the experimental side , progress was mainly achieved through the analysis of three specific processes .",
    "first , pionium decays into two neutral pions allow one to measure @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "experimental results have been published by the dirac collaboration  @xcite .",
    "second , using watson s theorem and numerical solutions of the roy equations  @xcite , it is possible to determine @xmath10 and @xmath3 from @xmath12 decays .",
    "experiments with spectacular statistics have been carried out in this channel also in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "last , the above mentioned cusp in @xmath13 decays has been investigated through the analysis of 6.031@xmath14 such events , and a high precision value for @xmath2 is now available  @xcite .",
    "it confirms the chiral prediction very nicely .",
    "indeed , combining @xmath15 decays and the result from the cusp analysis , the most recent publication by the na48/2 collaboration quotes  @xcite @xmath16 it seems fair to say that the precise values eq .   could only be obtained through a combined effort of experiment and theory .",
    "indeed , relating experimental data to the scattering lengths is a nontrivial affair  @xcite , and a precise theoretical description of the cusp behavior in the amplitude for @xmath13 turns out to be quite difficult .    in their most recent data analysis  @xcite , the na48/2 collaboration makes use of decay amplitudes constructed along two different frameworks . in the first one  @xcite",
    ", the structure of the singularity at the cusp is investigated using unitarity , analyticity , and the cluster decomposition .",
    "in addition , an approximation scheme is used , which consists in expanding the decay amplitude in powers of @xmath1 scattering lengths .",
    "the latest work  @xcite retains effects up to order ( scattering lengths)@xmath17 and omits radiative corrections .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is a detailed description of the second method  @xcite .",
    "it uses a lagrangian framework , which automatically satisfies unitarity and analyticity constraints and allows one to include electromagnetic contributions in a standard manner  @xcite . in order to retain the possibility of an expansion in powers of scattering lengths , which is a very convenient concept ,",
    "a non - relativistic framework is invoked that has already proven to be useful in the description of bound states  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review",
    ". the formalism has recently also found applications in various , mostly cusp - related studies  @xcite , such as @xmath18  @xcite and @xmath19  @xcite decays , as well as in near - threshold pion photo- and electroproduction on the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath9 decays have been evaluated within other frameworks as well .",
    "we shall come back to these in sect .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the two main difficulties we were faced with to evaluate the pertinent amplitudes are the following .",
    "* the huge statistics available require a very precise theoretical description of the decay amplitude , which allows to determine the scattering lengths from data with high precision as well .",
    "in particular , it is mandatory to include the effects of real and virtual photons [ `` radiative corrections '' ] . *",
    "the decay amplitudes can be calculated only within a certain approximation .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to set up a power counting scheme that permits to quantify the neglected effects in an algebraic manner .",
    "as far as we can see , quantum field theory is the only method that allows to satisfy these two requirements . independently of the method used ,",
    "one is in addition faced with the problem that the decay amplitudes for @xmath20 are beset with leading landau singularities  @xcite .",
    "this does not come as a surprise , because we are dealing with unstable particles here .",

    "the explicit expressions for the pertinent two - loop integrals are given in [ app : integralsff1f2 ] , and their holomorphic properties are discussed in [ app : analytic ] . in order to make certain that we were not lead astray with the non - relativistic framework , we have evaluated several of the emerging two - loop graphs in standard relativistic quantum field theory as well . in particular , in [ app : relequal ] , the case of relativistic two - loop integrals with equal pion masses is considered , while loops containing different pion masses are investigated in [ app : reldiff ] .",
    "landau singularities are considered in [ app : landau ] , and a comparison with the non - relativistic loop integrals is performed in [ app : compare_nrrel ] . finally , we comment on the decomposition of the amplitudes in singular and non - singular parts , as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in [ app : decomposition ] .",
    "in this section , we construct a non - relativistic effective field theory for the two - particle sector , which will later be used to describe pion  pion scattering . in order to simplify the discussion , here we first give a formulation for the case of a single self - interacting scalar field @xmath21 with mass @xmath22 . in the following , the theory will be extended to describe three - particle decays .",
    "the main difference to the conventional non - relativistic formalism is that our approach as developed here  despite the fact that we deal with a _ non - relativistic _ framework  yields _ explicitly invariant _ two - body scattering amplitudes .",
    "scattering , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ]",
    "the present form turns out to be very convenient to describe three - body decays , since , in particular , the location of the singularities in the two - body subsystems ( which are generally not in the rest frame ) coincide with the exact relativistic values to all orders in the non - relativistic expansion . in the conventional setting , this can be achieved only perturbatively , order by order .",
    "such a course of action is not wrong , but very cumbersome and certainly not elegant .    in a non - relativistic theory",
    ", one assumes that the momenta of all particles are much smaller than their masses .",
    "the question of the _ domain of applicability _ of the non - relativistic description is very subtle and depends on the dynamics of the particles considered . decays .",
    "however , as it is easy to check , the maximal momenta of the pions in this decay are of the order of the pion mass and thus the applicability of the non - relativistic theory in this case is not _ a priori _ clear . ]",
    "this issue will be discussed in detail in the following sections . for the moment",
    "we merely assume that using the non - relativistic framework can be justified , and proceed with its precise formulation .",
    "constructing an effective field theory implies setting certain counting rules .",
    "we formalize the definition of the non - relativistic domain by introducing a generic small parameter @xmath23 and postulating the following counting rules in this parameter .",
    "* the mass @xmath22 is to be counted as @xmath24 ; * all 3-momenta are counted as @xmath25 ; * consequently , the kinetic energies are counted as @xmath26 .",
    "the modified approach differs from the conventional one in two aspects .",
    "first , the usual non - relativistic propagator has a pole at @xmath27 that corresponds to the non - relativistic dispersion law .",
    "the higher - order corrections to this dispersion law are treated perturbatively , so that the results of loop calculations with the non - relativistic propagators can be made lorentz - invariant only approximately , at a given order in the expansion in @xmath28 . in the modified framework ,",
    "these higher - order corrections to the one - particle propagator are summed up , leading to the relativistic dispersion law @xmath29 .",
    "the second modification is related to the matching of the non - relativistic and relativistic theories . in the conventional non - relativistic approach ,",
    "the matching condition between two - body scattering amplitudes , which fixes the values of the non - relativistic couplings in terms of the parameters of the underlying relativistic theory , reads ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) [ eq : match1 ]",
    "_ i=1 ^ 4 ( 2w(*p*_i))^1/2 t_nr(*p*_3,*p*_4;*p*_1,*p*_2 ) = t_r(*p*_3,*p*_4;*p*_1,*p*_2 ) , where the subscripts @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) stand for the non - relativistic ( relativistic ) amplitudes .",
    "the additional factors @xmath32 for each external leg account for the different normalization of the non - relativistic and relativistic states .    since eq .",
    "is not explicitly covariant , the matching condition is different in different reference frames . for simplicity",
    ", we consider matching at threshold , where the relativistic amplitude is merely a constant @xmath33 _ in all reference frames_. on the other hand , the non - relativistic amplitude at threshold in different frames , obtained by expanding eq .   in momenta , is given by [ eq : tnr ] t_nr(*p*_3,*p*_4;*p*_1,*p*_2)|_thr = -*p*^2 +  , where @xmath34 denotes the total 3-momentum of the particles 1 and 2 at threshold .",
    "let us now limit ourselves to the tree approximation and suppose that one wishes to write down the non - relativistic effective lagrangian that reproduces eq .   in this approximation .",
    "such a lagrangian would have to consist of an infinite tower of operators , whose couplings are determined by a single constant @xmath35 .",
    "this again means that lorentz invariance can be taken into account only perturbatively , order by order in the expansion in @xmath28 .",
    "once more this procedure , albeit formally correct , looks rather awkward and renders higher - order calculations cumbersome .    in the particular case",
    "considered above , it is clear that the problem disappears if we arrange the non - relativistic theory in a way such that the overall non - invariant factor on the left - hand side of eq",
    ".   disappears .",
    "this can be achieved by a non - local rescaling of the non - relativistic field @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "in the modified theory , the normalization of the 1-particle states is given by the relativistic expression @xmath38 , whereas the matrix element of the free field operator between the vacuum and the one - particle state is normalized to unity : @xmath39 .",
    "the lagrangian with the rescaled field is given by = ^2w ( i_t- w ) + c(^)^2 ^ 2 +  , where @xmath40 denotes the lowest - order ( @xmath24 ) four - particle coupling and the ellipsis stands for four - point interactions with derivatives ( these terms count as @xmath41 and higher ) .",
    "note that the above lagrangian is non - local since it contains square roots of a differential operator .",
    "heavy - particle number should be conserved in the non - relativistic theory by construction ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the matching condition in tree approximation yields @xmath42 _ in all reference frames _ or , in other words",
    ", the truncation of the higher - derivative terms in the lagrangian does not render the non - relativistic amplitude non - invariant .",
    "the propagator in the rescaled theory is given by [ eq : propnew ] i0|t(x)^(y)|0= .",
    "from now on , we shall not display @xmath43 in the propagators explicitly .",
    "our next goal will be to demonstrate that    * in the above effective theory , the counting rules in @xmath23 , established at tree level , are not destroyed by loop corrections ; * the amplitude is explicitly lorentz - invariant also in the presence of loops .",
    "since all loop diagrams in the non - relativistic approach to the two - particle sector can be expressed through the elementary bubble integral [ eq : f ] j(p^0,*p*)= , we concentrate on this integral below .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 is calculated in an arbitrary reference frame characterized by the total 4-momentum @xmath45 .",
    "calculations are done in dimensional regularization , @xmath46 is the number of space - time dimensions and @xmath47 .    to begin with , we note that nave power counting predicts @xmath44 to be of @xmath48 : each propagator in the integral scales as @xmath49 , while the integration measure , with @xmath50 momenta and one energy integration , contributes a power @xmath51 .",
    "it can be checked by straightforward calculation that the loop given by eq .",
    "violates this power counting prediction .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon , caused by the presence of the heavy mass scale @xmath22 in the integrand . in order to circumvent this problem ,",
    "usual feynman rules in the effective theory have to be supplemented by some additional prescription that annihilates the high - energy contribution ( coming from the integration momenta of order @xmath22 ) to the feynman integral .",
    "we choose a particular prescription referred to as the `` threshold expansion ''  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a focused discussion of the issue within non - relativistic effective theories ) .",
    "the prescription defines how the square roots present in the particle propagators are handled in the calculations . according to the prescription ,",
    "one expands the integrand in a feynman integral in inverse powers of the heavy scale @xmath22 , integrates the resulting series term by term in dimensional regularization , and finally sums up the results .",
    "let us see how this prescription can be realized in practice . we perform the integration over @xmath52 in eq .   by using cauchy s theorem and",
    "rewrite @xmath44 as [ eq : ff ] j(p^0,*p*)= .",
    "further , performing the shift @xmath53 , we transform the integrand by using the identity @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "next , we investigate how the threshold expansion affects the result of the integration .",
    "according to power counting , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , expanding the last three terms in eq",
    ".   in powers of @xmath23 generates polynomials in the integration momentum @xmath62 . recalling that integrals containing only powers of @xmath62 vanish in dimensional regularization",
    ", we finally conclude that using the threshold expansion enables us to rewrite the integral in eq .   as [ eq : fff ] j(p^0,*p*)= .",
    "it is seen that the heavy scale @xmath22 has disappeared as a result of the threshold expansion .    in order to perform the integral in eq .",
    ", we choose the first axis along the momentum @xmath34 , so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "rescaling @xmath65 and doing the momentum integration , we finally arrive at [ eq : fs ] j(p^0,*p*)j(s)=(1-)^1/2+(d-3 ) .",
    "note also that @xmath66 coincides with the imaginary part of the relativistic one - loop integral .",
    "we summarize our main findings up to this point .    1 .",
    "if the threshold expansion is applied , the one - loop integral @xmath66 counts as @xmath72 , so the loops do not violate power counting .",
    "2 .   the insertion of derivative couplings does not violate power counting .",
    "@xmath66 is explicitly lorentz - invariant .",
    "since the tree - level amplitude is also invariant , so is the scattering amplitude at any given order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this statement is trivial for non - derivative couplings only ; one can easily ensure that it still holds in the presence of derivative couplings in the scattering amplitude .",
    "4 .   according to eq .",
    ", @xmath73 .",
    "this means in particular that the coupling constant @xmath40 is proportional to the scattering length _ to all orders in perturbation theory_. in general , the coupling constants of the non - relativistic theory are expressed through the effective - range expansion parameters in the two - particle sector . if in the following this non - relativistic lagrangian is used to evaluate pion ",
    "pion rescattering effects in the three - particle decay in perturbation theory , the result will be written in terms of these parameters .",
    "this property constitutes the major advantage of the non - relativistic approach as compared to a relativistic framework .",
    "for example , the decay amplitude calculated in chiral perturbation theory is given as an expansion in the quark masses , not in the scattering lengths ; if one attempts to extract the values of the scattering lengths from the data on three - particle decays , the accuracy of the former representation may not suffice .",
    "the generalization of this method to higher orders and to the case of non - identical particles with different masses can be performed in a straightforward manner .",
    "we conclude this section by a remark about the terminology used .",
    "we still refer to the above framework as `` non - relativistic , '' albeit the energies and momenta of particles in this approach obey relativistic dispersion laws",
    ". in our naming scheme , `` non - relativistic theory '' denotes a theory in which _ explicit antiparticle degrees of freedom _ are absent ( respectively , are included in the couplings of the effective lagrangian ) , and the number of particles is preserved in each interaction vertex .",
    "now we apply the modified non - relativistic framework to the @xmath1 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the masses of charged and neutral pions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are taken to be different , but virtual photons are not included at this stage . due to the inelastic coupling of the @xmath76 and the @xmath77 channels , a consistent power counting requires the quantity @xmath78 to be counted as @xmath41 .",

    "however , let us note that the non - relativistic framework is only used to correctly reproduce the non - analytic behavior of the decay amplitudes in the kinematical variables @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and to thus provide a parameterization consistent with unitarity and analyticity  a trivial polynomial part in the amplitudes can be removed by a redefinition of the couplings in the lagrangian .",
