    "laser doppler velocimeter ( ldv ) is an optical technique allowing direct measurement of local and instantaneous fluid velocity .",
    "this method is nonintrusive and is based on optical interferometry for estimating the velocity of scatterers suspended in a fluid by means of the frequency analysis of the light scattered by the seeding particles @xcite .    for fluid mechanics measurements ,",
    "the particle velocity can be considered as constant during the transit time of the seeding particle through the measurement volume ( defined by the interferometry fringes volume ) and the frequency of the ldv signal is constant during this period @xcite .",
    "typical order of magnitude of mean flow velocities are from a few meters per second up to higher than the acoustic celerity ( supersonic flow ) .",
    "the data processing consists then to estimate the power spectral density ( psd ) of the velocity signal , from poisson - based randomly distributed samples .",
    "psd may be estimated by interpolating the randomly distributed samples , by resampling the interpolating signal and by compensating the effect of interpolation in the fourier domain @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation function ( acf ) may also be reconstructed from the randomly distributed samples and the fourier transform of the estimated acf gives an estimation of the psd @xcite .",
    "lastly , kalman filtering may be used for estimating the psd @xcite .    for sine acoustic excitation ,",
    "the particle velocity is no longer constant and the ldv signal is frequency modulated @xcite-@xcite . to estimate the particle velocity from these signals , specific signal processing techniques are used as spectral analysis @xcite , photon correlation @xcite or frequency demodulation associated to post - processing methods @xcite .",
    "typical order of magnitude of mean flow velocities are from a few micrometers per second up to @xmath0 millimeters per second , for frequencies in @xmath1 $ ] hz .    on one hand , for most acoustic measurements , the particle velocity can be considered as the sum of an ac - component due to acoustic excitation and a weak dc - contribution due to flow . when the particle oscillates in the measurement volume during further acoustic periods , the effect of the flow can be reduced and usual post - processing methods may be used @xcite-@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dc - flow component prevents in many cases the use of the post - processing methods given by @xcite , because the signal time length is less or largely less than one acoustic period .",
    "the aim of this paper is to estimate both the dc ( flow ) and ac ( acoustic ) components from such ldv signals .",
    "lazreq and ville @xcite measured the acoustic velocity in presence of mean flow by means of a probe consisting in a hot wire and a microphone .",
    "their results showed a good agreement between the theory and the experiment but this probe can not be considered as nonintrusive .",
    "ldv has also been used by adapting the slotting technique to estimate the acoustic particle velocity in a turbulent flow @xcite with a 2d - ldv velocimeter .",
    "the acoustic impedance was estimated by means of a ldv probe and with a microphone probe and the different results were compared .",
    "finally , boucheron _ et al _ @xcite has developed a new method of signal processing called perio - correlation in order to estimate sine acoustic velocity in strong mean flow by ldv .    in this work ,",
    "the sine acoustic excitation is supposed to be perfectly known and a frequency demodulation technique @xcite is performed to estimate the particle velocity from the ldv signal . in this paper , we propose a new method to estimate jointly the acoustic particle velocity ( amplitude and phase ) and the mean flow velocity from the velocity signal .",
    "this method is based on the least mean square ( lms ) algorithm .",
    "the mean flow velocity , the amplitude and phase of acoustic particle velocity are estimated for each seeding particle crossing the measurement volume .",
    "furthermore , the cramr - rao bound ( crb ) of the associated problem is calculated .",
    "the crb gives the lowest variance of any unbiased estimator and consequently yields theoretically the minimum uncertainties linked to the velocity estimations ( acoustic and mean flow velocities ) .",
    "lastly , simulated data are processed , in order to validate the lms - based algorithm and to compare the variance of the results with the cramr - rao bound .    section ii deals with the ldv principles including the velocity signal modeling and the associated signal processing for acoustic applications . in section iii ,",
    "the data processing based on the least mean square algorithm is explained and the cramr - rao bound of both the mean flow and acoustic velocities are determined .",
    "finally , the results of the monte carlo simulation are shown and compared to the cramr - rao bounds in section iv , for acoustic frequencies in @xmath2 $ ] hz , for acoustic velocities in @xmath3 $ ] mm.s@xmath4 and for mean flow velocities in @xmath5 $ ] mm.s@xmath4 .",
