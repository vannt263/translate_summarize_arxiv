    "it has long been recognized that the formation processes of supermassive black - holes ( bhs ) and stars may be self - regulating ( dekel & silk 1986 ; silk & rees 1998 ) , since the amount of energy released by quasars and stars can exceed the binding energy of the gas clouds in which they are born .",
    "indeed , the stellar and central bh masses of galaxies show striking correlations with the depth of the gravitational potential well of their hosts .",
    "these phenomenological correlations take the form of the mass - velocity dispersion correlation for bhs ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al . 2002 ) and the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) and faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relations for stars in the present - day universe .    in this paper",
    "we explore the self - limiting growth of the bh and stellar masses of galaxies as a function of cosmic time , and investigate the consequences for the quasar luminosity function .",
    "recent work suggests that the kinetic output of quasars may be comparable to their radiative output ( see  2.1.1 in furlanetto & loeb 2001 ; begelman  2003 ) .",
    "our simple approach postulates that growth stops when the energy released by these sources exceeds the binding energy of the gas within their host galaxies after one dynamical time of the gas reservoir . using the redshift - dependent abundance of galactic halos as a function of potential depth in a @xmath3cdm cosmology ,",
    "we demonstrate that this simple approach describes the luminosity function of quasars in optical and x - ray bands .",
    "we adopt the wmap set of cosmological parameters ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) , namely mass density parameters of @xmath14 in matter , @xmath15 in baryons , @xmath16 in a cosmological constant , a hubble constant of @xmath17 , an rms amplitude of @xmath18 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath19mpc , and a primordial power - spectrum with a power - law index @xmath20 .",
    "we begin the paper with a discussion of the regulation of bh growth by feedback during luminous quasar phases (   [ feedback ] ) and then discuss the implications for modeling of the optical (   [ lumfunc ] ) and x - ray (   [ xraylf ] ) luminosity functions of quasars , including the number counts of high - redshift x - ray quasars (   [ numbercounts ] ) .",
    "we subsequently compute the mass accreted into bhs during luminous quasar phases (   [ accretion ] ) and compare this to the local density in bhs (   [ density ] ) , which we compute using the measured velocity dispersion function of _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) galaxies ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) . in   [ density ]",
    "we also demonstrate that the most massive bhs were already in place at high redshift .",
    "we then show in   [ star ] and   [ magorrian ] that while the @xmath8 relation is redshift - independent , the ratio of bh mass to stellar mass within galaxies should increase with increasing redshift if both are regulated by a similar feedback process .",
    "finally we compare our findings with some previous work in   [ prev ] and",
    "summarize our main conclusions in ",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the growth of a supermassive bh is expected to be accelerated during a galaxy merger , when cold gas is driven to the center of the merger remnant ( mihos & hernquist   1994 ; hernquist & mihos  1995 ) .",
    "yu & tremaine  ( 2002 ) have found that the local mass density in bhs is consistent with the integrated luminosity density of quasars if the mean radiative efficiency of the accreting material is @xmath21 ; moreover , they concluded that about half the current bh mass density was accreted near the eddington rate at redshift @xmath22 .",
    "it is natural to expect that a quasar shining at its limiting eddington luminosity could generate a powerful galactic wind and eventually terminate the accretion process that feeds it .",
    "indeed , silk & rees  ( 1998 ) pointed out that winds from quasars could generate self - regulating outflows in the surrounding gas , if the energy in the outflow liberates as much as the binding energy of the gas in a dynamical time . for a quasar output power that scales as the eddington limiting luminosity",
    ", this condition leads to a power - law scaling of the bh mass with halo velocity dispersion , @xmath23 .",
    "this scaling was used by haehnelt , natarajan & rees  ( 1998 ) to demonstrate consistency between the density of quasars at @xmath24 and the time derivative of the press - schechter mass - function for a quasar lifetime that is comparable with the salpeter time ( the @xmath7-folding time of the bh mass ) , @xmath25 . here",
    "we extend an earlier model ( wyithe & loeb  2002 ) to include feedback limited bh growth within the context of hierarchical merging in a @xmath3cdm cosmology .",
    "we compare our model with the most recent data for the space density of high redshift quasars at both optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we assume that following a merger , a bh shines at a fraction @xmath26 of its eddington luminosity ( @xmath27 ) returning fraction @xmath28 of this energy ) . ] to the galactic gas .",
    "the quasar will unbind the galactic gas if it supplies as much as the gravitational binding energy of the gas over the time it takes the gas to respond dynamically to this energy injection , @xmath29 .",
    "the cold gas is usually located in a disk with a characteristic radius @xmath30 ( mo , mao & white  1998 ) , and hence a dynamical time ( as appropriate for a radial orbit ) rather than @xmath31 ( as appropriate for a circular orbit ) . ] of @xmath32 . here",

    "the value of @xmath28 should be of order unity if the gas traps much of the quasar output energy without radiating it away ( begelman  2003 ) .",
    "the self - regulation condition is then , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the halo mass , @xmath44 is the mass accreted and @xmath45 is the eddington luminosity per unit mass ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that we assume ( as appropriate at high redshifts ) that all the gas within a galactic halo cools on a time much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "our primary objective is to show that this condition is sufficient to describe the quasar luminosity function at @xmath47 ( before groups and clusters of galaxies become prominent ) .",
    "equation  ( [ quasarbound ] ) implies @xmath48 as inferred for galactic halos in the local universe ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "the index of 5 is larger than the 4 - 4.5 inferred from the local @xmath8 relation ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , the difference having it origin in the observation that the @xmath49 relation is shallower than linear ( ferrarese  2002 ) .",
    "the index of 5 is also larger than presented in the recent work of baes , buyle , hau & dejonghe  ( 2003 ) , with the difference having its origin in the uncertainty in the slope of the @xmath8 relation .",
    "feedback regulated growth implies that the @xmath50 relation is independent of redshift , @xmath51 the redshift independence is consistent with the recent results of shields et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . using quasars out to @xmath24",
    ", they demonstrated that the @xmath8 relation does not evolve with redshift .",

    "the only adjustable parameter in our model if @xmath54 is @xmath28 .",
    "if the bh growth was mostly complete by a redshift @xmath55 - 2 ( yu & tremaine  2002 )",
    "so that the local bh masses reflect the limiting values at that redshift , then a value of @xmath56 is consistent with bh masses that are measured locally ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "this implies a value of @xmath57 .",
    "modification of the simple scheme described above would be required if cooling of the gas heated by the outflow is important so that additional energy is required to unbind the gas .",
    "the factor required could be as large as @xmath58 based on momentum conservation ( begelman  2003 ) , with the resulting dependence @xmath59 .",
    "this relation is shallower than observed .",
    "the importance of cooling can be evaluated by estimating the cooling time for virialized gas .",
    "the cooling rate for primordial gas of temperature @xmath60k and proton density @xmath61 ^ 3$]cm@xmath10 ( typical for a virialized halo ) is @xmath63 ^ 6 ( t_{\\rm vir}/10 ^ 6{\\rm k})^{1/2}$]erg cm@xmath10 s@xmath64 ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) .",
    "we have adopted a cooling rate that increases as @xmath65 above @xmath66k assuming that it is dominated by bremsstrahlung at higher temperatures .",
    "the thermal energy per unit volume in this gas is @xmath67",
    "^ 3\\left({t_{\\rm vir}}/{10 ^ 6\\mbox{k}}\\right)$]erg cm@xmath10 .",
    "the cooling time for virialized gas is therefore @xmath68 where the virial temperature is given by ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) , @xmath69^{1/3 } \\left({1+z\\over 3}\\right)~ { \\rm k}.\\ ] ] the cooling time should be compared with the characteristic lifetime of the quasar , which our model relates to the dynamical time of the galactic disk , @xmath70^{-1/2}\\left({1+z\\over 3}\\right)^{-3/2}~{\\rm yr}. \\label{eq : life}\\ ] ] thus we expect the halo cooling time to be longer than @xmath29 in the range of redshifts and virial temperatures relevant for bright quasars .",
    "as soon as the gas is expelled into the galactic halo and is heated beyond its virial temperature , it will not be able to cool during the quasar activity .",
    "hence we assume that accretion is halted as soon as the quasar supplies the entire galactic gas with more than its binding energy .",
    "the peak in the quasar luminosity function at @xmath71 coincides with the transition of the characteristic mass scale of collapsed halos through the mass range of interest for the @xmath72 relation . in the present - day universe ,",
    "the characteristic @xmath73-@xmath1 mass scale is @xmath74-@xmath75 .",
    "however galaxies reflect the characteristic mass scale of @xmath76-@xmath77 at @xmath71 , and combine to make groups and clusters rather than super - galaxies today",
    ". it may be that galaxies of this characteristic size do not form due to prevention of cooling through conduction or the removal of cold gas from halos ( e.g. benson et al .",
    "2003 ) , or because the stars in giant ellipticals have already formed and expelled the surrounding gas at @xmath2 ( loeb & peebles  2003 ) .",
    "the excursion set formalism describes the rate of galaxy mergers near the characteristic mass at times earlier than @xmath71 , but describes the formation rate of groups and clusters near the characteristic mass at later times .",
    "the evolution of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function is therefore only tractable to analytic descriptions at early times ( @xmath47 ) , while the faint end should be tractable at all redshifts .",
    "since the observed quasar luminosity function implies that around half the mass in bhs was accreted before @xmath71 , the @xmath72 relation should be evident in the bright end of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath78 .",
    "we now demonstrate that this is indeed the case .",
    "we model the quasar luminosity function assuming that quasar activity follows major galaxy mergers ( mass ratios greater than 3 ) during which bhs coalesce ( kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) . a linear relation between bh mass and halo mass ( @xmath79 ) would be a natural consequence of bh growth that is dominated by coalescence ( haehnelt et al .",
    "however , a nonlinear relation must result from significant mass accretion during the active quasar phase as found by yu & tremaine  ( 2002 ) .",
    "our approach is based on the formalism described in wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) .",
    "each quasar is assumed to shine at its eddington luminosity over a lifetime @xmath80 .",
    "the quasar light curve may therefore be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the eddington luminosity in the b - band of a bh with mass @xmath0 in solar masses .",
    "the quasar luminosity function ( comoving number density of quasars per b - band luminosity @xmath83 ) is then @xmath84,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the mass function and merger rate for bhs respectively , @xmath87 is the cosmic time at redshift @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the dirac delta function . integrating over @xmath0 we find @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the scale factor , @xmath92 is the formation redshift of the quasar , and we have used the relation between black - hole and halo mass .",
    "evaluation of this expression requires the number of mergers of halos of mass between @xmath93 and @xmath94 with halos of mass @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( lacey & cole  1993 ) , as well as the co - moving density of halos with mass @xmath95 , @xmath97 ( press & schechter  1974 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath98 , we then obtain @xmath99 , yielding the luminosity function @xmath100 where we have used @xmath101 .",
    "we impose a lower cutoff on the mass of halos that can contain a quasar .",
    "following reionization , the cutoff mass corresponds to the jeans mass in an ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) , i.e. a virial temperature of @xmath102k ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ quasarbound ] ) implies that the quasar lifetime should be identified with the dynamical time of a galactic disk , @xmath103 , where @xmath29 is given in equation  ( [ eq : life ] ) .",
    "we show a comparison between the observed and theoretical luminosity functions in fig .",
    "the model successfully describes the known features of the optical quasar luminosity function at @xmath47 .",
    "we also show on these plots the range of quasar luminosities corresponding to bh masses observed locally to define the @xmath104 relation ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the black holes powering quasars at @xmath71 are at the upper end of the mass range of the bhs observed locally .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath72 relation is obeyed locally by galaxies , but not by groups or clusters of galaxies inside of which the hot gas is unable to feed the bh .",
    "our model luminosity function therefore over - predicts the number of bright quasars at low redshift .",
    "however , our luminosity function correctly describes the density of quasars at @xmath55 below the break in the luminosity function .",
    "this luminosity regime corresponds to most of the bh mass range in the locally observed @xmath72 relation . in order to match the bright end of the observed galaxy luminosity function ,",
    "the infall of gas into galaxies with @xmath105 must be suppressed ( kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) .",
    "this scale indeed corresponds to the cut - off in the @xmath35 distribution of galaxies ( sheth et al .",
    "the dotted lines show the luminosity of a bh within a galaxy of mass @xmath106 corresponding to a circular velocity of @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "this scale is close to the break in the quasar luminosity function at low - redshifts .",
    "near the peak of quasar activity at redshifts of @xmath71@xmath109 our model predicts a quasar lifetime of @xmath110 years .",
    "this result naturally explains observational estimates of quasar lifetimes ( e.g steidel et al .",
    "2002 ; yu & tremaine  2002 ; haiman & hui  2001 ; martini & weinberg  2001 ) .",
    "it is important to note that our model suggests that the observed lifetime is typical of quasars near the peak of the luminosity function , but that quasars at higher redshift have shorter lifetimes .    at redshifts below the peak of quasar activity",
    "our model successfully describes the luminosity function at luminosities fainter than the break ( the agreement of the slope is particularly good ) .",
    "boyle et al .  ( 2000 ) found that the luminosity function at @xmath111 is well described by a luminosity evolution .",
    "however inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] suggests that the evolution of quasars does not follow a luminosity evolution at high redshifts .",
    "in particular , our model suggests that rather than being an intrinsic feature of the quasars themselves , the break in the luminosity function is present only at low redshift and is a product of the inability of gas to cool inside massive dark matter halos .",
    "we also see that the faint end slope ( reproduced at low redshift ) evolves , becoming steeper at high redshift .",
    "we emphasize that the redshift dependence of @xmath112 in equation  ( [ eps ] ) is necessary to explain the density of bright quasars at @xmath12 .",
    "if the characteristic feedback time was constant , so that @xmath113 as is the case for stars ( see  3 ) , then the sharp decline in the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function with increasing halo mass would have resulted in a deficit of luminous quasars that can not be compensated for by arbitrarily long quasar lifetimes .",
    "for example we find that the predicted density of quasars at @xmath71-@xmath109 can be made consistent with observations by using a quasar lifetime of @xmath114 years , but that the quasar abundance at @xmath12 is underestimated by @xmath115 orders of magnitude .",
    "the success of our model is particularly impressive , given the fact that its only free parameter ( @xmath116 ) is directly set by local observations of bh masses , and that it assumes only that bh growth in a galactic disk is self regulating . in the following section , we demonstrate that this success extends into the x - ray regime .",
    "haiman & loeb  ( 1999 ) noted that the luminosity function of quasars in the x - ray band at @xmath24 can be related to the b - band luminosity function at that redshift if the median quasar spectral energy distribution is universal ( elvis  1994 ) .",
    "they then extrapolated their model to predict the number counts of @xmath117 quasars and found that @xmath118 should be detected in a _",

    "barger et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have since found one @xmath117 quasar in a circle of radius @xmath119 at a flux level @xmath120 .",
    "the new constraints provided by these very high redshift x - ray quasars ( as well as optical high redshift quasars ) motivate us to revisit the issue of modeling the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the number counts of x - ray quasars provide strong additional constraints on models of the luminosity function . at high luminosities , wide field surveys by the rosat satellite",
    "provide the x - ray luminosity function in the same luminosity range as the optical luminosity function",
    ". therefore at @xmath24 , the comparison of the model optical and x - ray luminosity functions with the respective data sets tests the applicability of the median quasar spectrum adopted for the modeling ( haiman & loeb  1999 ) .",
    "however the deep x - ray surveys now becoming available ( cowie et al .",
    "2002 ; barger et al .",
    "2003 ) probe bolometric quasar luminosities at @xmath121 that are @xmath122 orders of magnitude fainter than are probed in the optical .",
    "this large dynamic range in luminosities provides a long lever arm for testing models of quasar evolution .",
    "we follow haiman & loeb  ( 1999 ) and construct the x - ray luminosity function in analogy with the b - band luminosity function using the median quasar spectrum of elvis  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the universality of the spectrum is supported by the latest x - ray data on high redshift quasars ( brandt et al .",
    "2002 ; vignali et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to facilitate comparison with observed luminosity functions",
    "we compute the luminosity @xmath123 in an ( intrinsic ) x - ray band ( e.g. 28kev ) by integrating over the median spectrum . in analogy with equation  ( [ lf ] )",
    "we find @xmath124 here @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the spectral energy distribution of a solar mass bh radiating at its eddington limit and @xmath127 is the photon energy .    in the upper two panels of fig .",

    "these luminosities refer to the 28kev range and should be compared to the dotted luminosity function .",
    "several features of the comparison are similar to those of the optical luminosity function .",
    "the agreement is excellent at redshifts above the peak in quasar activity .",

    "the interpretation of these features was discussed in the previous section . as noted by haiman & loeb  ( 1999 )",
    "the success of the model in producing both the optical and x - ray quasar luminosity functions at @xmath47 indicates that the median quasar spectral energy distribution is also a good representation at high redshifts . to help with the orientation between the optical ( haiman & loeb  1998 ) and x - ray luminosity functions , we have placed vertical dashed lines at luminosities corresponding to the limits of the observed range of",

    "the model produces the normalization and slope of the sdss luminosity function , then becomes less steep at lower luminosities , and intersects the point computed from the x - ray observations , some 2.5 orders of magnitude away in luminosity ( and therefore bh mass ) and 2.5 orders of magnitude away in density per logarithm of luminosity .",
    "similarly , the model satisfies the normalization of the luminosity function at @xmath12 for both the low and high luminosity quasars as well as the constraint on the slope of the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "the model also reproduces the suggestion from the data that the density of quasars changes more rapidly at higher luminosities between @xmath149 and @xmath12 .",

    "we have plotted the resulting mass function at @xmath183 , 3 and 6 in fig .",

    "we can estimate the co - moving density of black - holes directly from the observed quasar luminosity function and our estimate of quasar lifetime . at the peak of quasar activity , quasars powered by @xmath187 bhs had a comoving density of @xmath188 .",

    "we find that for the nearest @xmath201 and @xmath196 bhs , the angular radius of influence should be similar .",
    "thus the dynamical signature of @xmath202 bhs on their stellar host should be detectable .",
    "the luminosities of the brightest quasars at @xmath71@xmath109 imply bh masses of @xmath203 , even if they accrete at their eddington rate .",
    "the masses could be lower if the emission is beamed , though this does not appear to be the case for high redshift quasars ( e.g. willott , mclure & jarvis  2003 ) .",
    "the implied density of @xmath203 bhs is in excess of the densities obtained by convolving the galaxy velocity function ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) with the @xmath8 relation ( merritt & ferrarese  2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "this is shown by the dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "here we have estimated the density of black - holes as implied by the quasar luminosity function at @xmath204 and @xmath24 according to @xmath205 where we have used @xmath206 .",
    "the presence of these bhs at @xmath207 may imply that these very massive bhs will be found in the central galaxies of large clusters of galaxies .",
    "we may derive the limiting stellar mass of a galaxy in view of the same self - regulation principle ( dekel & woo  2002 ) .",
    "suppose that stars form with an efficiency @xmath208 out of the gas that collapses and cools within a dark - matter halo , and that a fraction @xmath209 of each supernova energy output , @xmath210 , heats the galactic gas mechanically .",
    "the mechanical feedback will halt the star formation once the cumulative energy returned to the gas by supernovae equals its binding energy ( assuming negligible radiative losses for a sufficiently rapid starburst ) .",
    "hence the limiting stellar mass is set by the condition , @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the mass in stars ( in @xmath46 ) per supernova explosion .",
    "equation  ( [ starbound ] ) implies that the total mass in stars , @xmath213 , scales as @xmath214^\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1+z\\right).\\ ] ]    at a fixed redshift , the star formation efficiency scales as @xmath215 .",
    "thus smaller galaxies are less efficient at forming stars , but a galaxy of fixed mass is more efficient at higher redshift",
    ". a scalo  ( 1986 ) mass function of stars has @xmath216 per supernova and @xmath217 ergs , and so we find that a mass in stars of @xmath218 and a velocity of @xmath219 [ the typical value observed locally ( bell & de jong  2001 ) ] implies @xmath220 and @xmath221 . the star formation efficiency in the most massive spiral galaxies is therefore expected to be @xmath222 .",
    "in the preceding sections we have found that the mass of bhs scales as @xmath223 while the star formation efficiency scales as @xmath224 . this is because the luminosity of a quasar is limited by the eddington value and is proportional to the bh mass , while the energy release rate of supernovae is proportional to the total stellar mass .",
    "hence we find that the ratio of bh to stellar mass , @xmath225^\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(1+z\\right)^\\frac{3}{2 } , \\label{eq : magorrian}\\ ] ] is independent of mass as observed ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , we find that the relation evolves with redshift , and that the bh comprises a larger fraction of the stellar mass at a higher redshift .",
    "this effect has been seen in a sample of gravitationally lensed quasars ( with lensed host galaxies ) ; rix et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that host galaxies are much fainter at @xmath71 when compared with lower redshift galaxies containing quasars of comparable luminosity .",
    "our results are also consistent with the semi - analytic predictions of kauffmann & haehnelt  ( 2000 ) .",
    "since the work by haehnelt , natarajan & rees  ( 1998 ) there have been several attempts to describe the quasar luminosity function within hierarchical merging scenarios through semi - analytic modeling .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt  ( 2000 ) assumed that the @xmath226@xmath1 relation was set by the amount of gas that cools and becomes available for star formation .",
    "they found that they could explain the decrease in quasar activity at low redshift based on the decrease in merger rates , the decrease in the gas available to fuel bhs , and the assumption that gas accrets more slowly at late times .",
    "for an accretion timescale that scales as @xmath227 , these considerations led to quasar hosts that are a factor of 10 less massive at @xmath71 than in the local universe .",
    "volonteri , haardt & madau  ( 2002 ) followed the evolution of the bh population through a merger - tree algorithm .",
    "they modeled the luminosity function by fixing the @xmath8 relation from observations , and forcing the quasar lifetime following a merger to be equal to the time for accretion of the mass to match the @xmath8 relation at an efficiency of 10% .",
    "di matteo , croft , springel & hernquist  ( 2003 ) noted that the above studies either assume the @xmath8 relation from observations , or derive it based on additional assumptions .",
    "they suggested that a linear relationship between the gas in bulges and @xmath0 results in the local @xmath8 relation , the drop in quasar density at low redshift , and the regulation of bh growth through supernovae feedback .",
    "however their model over - predicts the density of high - redshift quasars . in their conclusion ,",
    "di matteo et al .  ( 2003 ) state that it seems unlikely that bh accretion affects gas dynamics in galaxies unless feedback from the quasar itself is important . on the other hand , the importance of quasar feedback has recently been highlighted by begelman  ( 2003 ) .    in the previous sections , we have demonstrated that a scenario in which quasar feedback limits bh growth through regulation of the quasar lifetime naturally reproduces the quasar luminosity function at high redshifts .",
    "for the first time we have compared the model to both the @xmath2 sdss luminosity function and the x - ray luminosity function , allowing comparison over @xmath147 orders of magnitude in flux and 3 orders of magnitude in quasar density per logarithmic luminosity interval at @xmath117 .",
    "the success of the model signals several important implications .",
    "first , around the peak of quasar activity at @xmath5 the quasar lifetime , interpreted here as the dynamical time of the host galactic disk , is @xmath6 years [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : life ] ) ] .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for observational estimates of the lifetime ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "2002 ; yu & tremaine  2002 ) .",
    "moreover , the dynamical time of the disk becomes comparable to the salpeter growth time at this redshift , so that most of the mass in a given bh was added during this epoch .",
    "thus we suggest that the growth of bhs during luminous quasar phases around this time , regulated by feedback from the quasar itself , set the slope and amplitude of the the @xmath228 relation observed today .",
    "we have shown that if bhs grow in the centers of galaxies until they unbind the galactic gas that feeds them over a dynamical time , then the locally observed relation between bh mass and halo velocity dispersion ( ferrarese 2002 ) is recovered both in slope and normalization .",
    "we include this feedback regulation of bh growth in a model of the quasar luminosity function and find that the observed optical quasar luminosity function at @xmath47 as well as at luminosities below the break at lower redshifts , are reproduced for hierarchical merging of galactic halos in the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology .",
    "moreover , using the median quasar spectral energy distribution we showed that the same model yields good agreement with the x - ray quasar luminosity function at @xmath47 ( and the luminosity function below the break at lower redshifts ) .",
    "the model suggests that @xmath143 faint quasars at @xmath139 and @xmath229 at @xmath117 should have been found in the _ chandra _ deep field north at a flux above @xmath230 , in agreement with the observed number counts .",
    "overall , the model describes observations of the high redshift luminosity function over @xmath147 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity and @xmath147 orders of magnitude in comoving density per logarithm of luminosity .",
    "this success is impressive given the fact that the model is based on a simple algorithm with only one adjustable parameter , namely the quasar feedback power in eddington units @xmath116 , and that this quantity is set by local observations of bh masses . our model associates the inferred quasar lifetime of @xmath231 years ( steidel et al .",
    "2002 ) with the dynamical time of a galactic disk during the peak of quasar population ( @xmath71@xmath109 ) .",
    "moreover , since the quasar lifetime is comparable to the salpeter time during this epoch , the model suggests that the slope and normalization of the locally observed @xmath72 relation resulted from feedback regulated accretion around this epoch .",
    "we have computed the local mass - function of bhs by combining the @xmath8 relation with the measured velocity dispersion function of sheth et al .",
    "comparison of the local bh mass function with the mass function inferred from the feedback relation and halo mass - function implies that the most massive galaxies already hosted their present - day bhs by @xmath24@xmath232 ( see also loeb & peebles 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we showed that if supernova feedback regulates star formation in a similar way , then the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relation between the bh and stellar masses of galactic spheroids should be redshift dependent [ see eq .",
