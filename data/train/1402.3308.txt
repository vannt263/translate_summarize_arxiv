    "snow lines are thought to regulate the planet formation process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "snow lines are also important because dust piles up in the pressure trap just inside the snow line and the grains become stickier as ice condenses on their surfaces .",
    "the composition of a planet and its atmosphere are determined by where the planet forms , and where it accretes material relative to the snow lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the water snow line occurs at a temperature of around @xmath3 @xcite and currently in our solar system is observed to be at a radius of @xmath4 , within the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "the co snow line occurs at a cooler temperature of about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "comets , from the kuiper belt , have varying amounts of co , suggesting that they formed close to the co snow line @xcite . some dwarf planets such as pluto and comets in the kuiper belt contain the even more volatile @xmath6 gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implying that they may have formed beyond the co snow line .",
    "the kuiper belt is currently thought to have formed in the approximate region @xmath7 @xcite and thus , at the time of planetesimal formation the co snow line would have been in this region .",
    "the co snow line could mark the transition from the planet forming region to the formation of smaller icy bodies and dwarf planets , like pluto .",
    "the water snow line is hard to observe in exosolar systems because it is very close to the star .",
    "however , the co snow line is an easier target because it is farther away .",
    "the best studied co snow line is in a solar nebula analogue disk around tw hya .",
    "the star has a mass of @xmath8 and an age of less than @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the reactive ion @xmath10 which is only present where co is frozen out .",
    "they found that the co snow line lies at @xmath11 , similar to that in our solar system .",
    "understanding the evolution of the co snow line is essential to deciphering the origins of prebiotic molecules that are necessary for life @xcite .",
    "co ice is needed to form methanol which is a building block for more complex organic molecules .",
    "comets are thought to have bombarded the early earth , thus delivering these molecules to earth and allowing life to emerge . in this work",
    "we therefore consider the evolution of the co snow line in various models of protoplanetary disks .",
    "angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks is thought to be driven by turbulence generated by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is now widely acknowledged that protoplanetary disks are not sufficiently ionised for the mri to operate throughout .",
    "they contain a _",
    "dead zone _ , a region of low turbulence at the disk mid - plane where the mri is suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
