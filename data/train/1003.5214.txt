    "stellar population models of absorption line indices are a key tool for the analysis of star cluster and galaxy absorption spectra .",
    "they are used to derive the fundamental stellar population properties such as age , metallicity and element abundance ratios . in particular , optical absorption line diagnostics in the spectra of evolved stellar populations have successfully been adopted in the past in studies on galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this system consists of index definitions for 25 prominent absorption features between 4000 and @xmath2  present in the spectra of evolved stellar populations .    for studies of galaxy and star cluster evolution , absorption lines need to be modelled for stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "empirical calibrations on the other hand have the disadvantage to be hardwired to the chemical abundance pattern of the milky way , which can be overcome in a semi - empirical approach as in the models by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite    empirical calibrations can be inserted in the models in two ways . in the first and most widely used approach , absorption line indices enter stellar population modelling through calibrations of the empirical relationship between the indices and the stellar atmospheric parameters t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] as provided by stellar libraries . as these calibrations are usually obtained through polynomial fitting procedures",
    "they are commonly referred to as fitting functions. the quality of the final stellar population model critically depends on the accuracy with which these relationships can be inferred from stellar libraries , i.e.  the coverage of stellar parameter space and the reliability of the index measurements .",
    "the computational procedure with which the fitting functions are determined is a further crucial step in producing accurate models .",
    "a number of studies in the literature are devoted to such empirical calibrations for various stellar libraries , either for the lick indices , parts of the lick indices or other prominent absorption features @xcite .",
    "alternatively to the use of fitting functions , absorption line indices can be measured directly on the synthetic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from stellar population models that are based on empirical stellar libraries .",
    "the benefit of this method is that the full sed can be compared pixel - by - pixel to observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major strength of fitting functions , instead , lies in the fact that they allow for interpolation between well populated regions of stellar parameter space which increases the accuracy of the model in stellar parameter space that is only sparsely sampled by empirical stellar libraries .",
    "moreover , each absorption index or spectral feature is represented by an individual fitting function , which is optimised to best reproduce its behaviour in stellar parameter space .",
    "fitting functions are also easier to implement in a stellar population synthesis code , and models based on fitting functions are better comparable .    the widely used fitting functions of @xcite and @xcite are based on the lick / ids stellar library @xcite .",
    "they are adopted in most stellar population models @xcite in the literature .",
    "other fitting functions based on the same stellar library exist @xcite and lead to overall consistent results in the final stellar population model @xcite .",
    "major progress has been made with the advent of a new generation of stellar libraries @xcite that have led to considerable improvements regarding coverage of stellar parameter space , spectral resolution , signal - to - noise ratio , and flux calibration .",
    "in particular the latter is a critical step forward . as the lick / ids system is not flux calibrated",
    ", observations have to be re - calibrated onto the lick / ids system through comparison with lick standard stars .",
    "this requirement hampers the analysis of data samples for which spectra of such calibration stars are either not available at sufficient quality or do not cover the appropriate rest - frame wavelength range .",
    "this problem is most imminent in high redshift observations and in galaxy redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the new flux calibrated libraries allow the analysis of flux calibrated spectra at any redshift without spectroscopic standard stars .",
    "flux - calibrated stellar libraries in the literature that are suitable for stellar population modelling include the _ jones _",
    "@xcite , _ elodie _",
    "@xcite , _ stelib _ @xcite and _ miles _ @xcite libraries .",
    "the _ miles _",
    "library is particularly well suited for stellar population modelling of absorption line indices owing to its favourable combination of spectral resolution , wavelength range , stellar parameter coverage , and quality of flux calibration . in this paper",
    "we present new lick index fitting functions based on the _ miles _ stellar library . to take advantage of the full spectral resolution of the _ miles _ library we have produced fitting functions for both the lower lick / ids resolution ( @xmath5  fwhm ) and the higher resolution of the _ miles _ library ( 2.3   fwhm ) .",
    "a new version of the tmb stellar population model of absorption line indices based on these new fitting functions will be presented in a subsequent paper .",

    "<S> stellar population models of absorption line indices are an important tool for the analysis of stellar population spectra . </S>",
    "<S> they are most accurately modelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with the stellar parameters effective temperature , metallicity , and surface gravity , the so - called fitting functions . here </S>",
    "<S> we present new empirical fitting functions for the 25 optical lick absorption line indices based on the new stellar library miles . </S>",
    "<S> the major improvements with respect to the lick / ids library are the better sampling of stellar parameter space , a generally higher signal- to - noise , and a careful flux calibration . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we find that errors on individual index measurements in miles are considerably smaller than in lick / ids . </S>",
    "<S> instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting functions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we provide fitting functions for both lick / ids and miles spectral resolutions , and compare our results with other fitting functions in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> a fortran 90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar population models . </S>",
    "<S> we further calculate the offsets in index measurements between the lick / ids system to a flux calibrated system . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we use the three libraries miles , elodie , and stelib . </S>",
    "<S> we find that offsets are negligible in some cases , most notably for the widely used indices h@xmath0 , mg@xmath1 , fe5270 , and fe5335 . in a number of cases , however , the difference between flux calibrated library and lick / ids is significant with the offsets depending on index strengths . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there is no general agreement between the three libraries for a large number of indices , which hampers the derivation of a universal offset between the lick / ids and flux calibrated systems .    </S>",
