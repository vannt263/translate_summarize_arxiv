    "the availability of accurate positions for grbs from the bepposax satellite ( @xcite ) allowed for the first time to detect delayed emission associated with grbs in x - ray ( @xcite , b,@xcite , b ) , optical ( @xcite ) and radio ( @xcite ) wave - bands .",
    "the detection of absorption lines in the optical afterglow of grb970508 provided the first direct estimate of source distance , constraining the redshift of grb970508 to @xmath7 ( @xcite ) . observed x - ray to radio afterglows are broadly consistent with models based on relativistic blast waves at cosmological distances ( @xcite , b,@xcite ) . using these models , combined radio and optical data allowed for the first time to directly estimate the total grb energy , implying an energy of @xmath8 for grb970508 ( @xcite ) .    in fireball models of grb afterglow",
    ", the energy released by an explosion , @xmath9erg , is converted to kinetic energy of a thin baryon shell expanding at ultra - relativistic speed . after producing the grb , the shell impacts on surrounding gas , driving an ultra - relativistic shock into the ambient medium .",
    "after a short transition phase , the expanding blast wave approaches a self - similar behavior where the expansion lorentz factor decreases with radius as @xmath10 .",
    "the expanding shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates relativistic electrons , which produce the observed radiation through synchrotron emission .",
    "photons emitted at radius @xmath2 with frequency @xmath11 , measured in the shell rest frame , are observed over a wide frequency range , @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and wide time range , since photons emitted further from the source - observer line of sight arrive at later time and are observed to have lower energy .",
    "there is no unique relation , therefore , between the radius @xmath2 and the time or frequency at which radiation emitted at @xmath2 is observed .",
    "however , since most of the emission from radius @xmath2 detected by a distant observer originates from a disk of radius @xmath14 around the source - observer line of sight , and since photons emitted at a distance @xmath15 from the line of sight with frequency @xmath11 ( in the shell frame ) are observed with frequency @xmath16 and are delayed ( compared to photons emitted on the line of sight ) by @xmath17 , it is commonly assumed that at observed time @xmath3 the flux peaks at frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the frequency at which the emission peaks in the shell rest frame . based on the same argument",
    ", it is assumed that photons of frequency @xmath18 arrive over a time scale @xmath20 .",
    "it had recently been claimed ( @xcite ) that due to shock deceleration the commonly used relation @xmath3 should be replaced by @xmath4 .",
    "applying the suggested deceleration modification would make it difficult to reconcile observed afterglow time scales with blast wave model predictions .",
    "this modification may have other implications .",
    "for example , shortly after the suggestion by goodman ( 1997 ) , that local inter - stellar scintillation may modulate the radio flux of grb afterglows , radio variability on time scale consistent with scintillation origin has been observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , while the source size based on using the relation @xmath4 is @xmath21 times larger than required to allow for diffractive scintillation , implying that only refractive scintillation is likely ( goodman 1997 ) , the observed large amplitude of radio variability suggests that modulation , if due to scintillation , should be produced by diffraction . using the relation @xmath3 , on the other hand ,",
    "implies a source size which is compatible with that required for diffractive scintillation .",
    "similarly , the larger size implied by the suggested modification implies that it would be difficult to observe microlensing of the optical emission ( @xcite ) .    in  2 we present a detailed analysis of the implications of the relativistic hydrodynamics of expanding blast waves to the observed afterglow .",
    "we find that the modification due to shock deceleration of the numerical coefficient in the expression @xmath3 , giving the time at which the flux peaks at observed frequency @xmath18 , is small .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the exact value of the numerical coefficient depends not only on the hydrodynamics , but also on the details of the electron energy distribution and on the magnetic field distribution behind the shock . due to the lack of a theory describing these distributions ,",
    "the exact value of the numerical coefficient can not be determined .",
    "however , it can be shown that the effect of deceleration is small .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relation @xmath4 gives the delay of photons emitted from the fireball at radius @xmath2 from a point on the shock front on the line of sight , while most photons suffer longer delays , since they are emitted from a shell of finite thickness behind the shock , and from positions off the line of sight .",
    "we show that at time @xmath3 the fireball appears on the sky as a narrow ring of radius @xmath15 ( this conclusion is independent of the details of electron and magnetic field distribution ) .",
    "our conclusions and their implications are summarized in  3 .",
    "let us consider a strong , spherical , ultra - relativistic shock wave expanding into an ambient medium of uniform density .",
    "for a shock propagating with a lorentz factor @xmath22 , the lorentz factor , number density and energy density of shocked fluid at the shock discontinuity are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , where @xmath26 is the number density ahead of the shock ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations indicate that the fraction of blast wave energy carried by electrons is not large , @xmath27 , and that the electron cooling time is long compared to the dynamical time , i.e. to the blast wave expansion time ( @xcite , b ) .",
    "this implies that the energy lost to radiation is small , and that the blast wave energy is approximately constant ( so called `` adiabatic blast wave '' ) .",
    "since the total energy in shocked particles is proportional to @xmath28 , conservation of energy implies @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some fiducial radius .",
    "in fireball models of grb afterglow it is assumed that the fractions of energy carried by magnetic field and by electrons are time independent . under this assumption",
    "the magnetic field @xmath31 and the characteristic electron lorentz factor @xmath32 ( in the shell frame ) scale as @xmath33 .",
    "the observed radiation is produced by synchrotron emission of the shock accelerated electrons .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron frequency in the shell frame scales as @xmath34 .",
    "the number of photons emitted as the shock propagates a distance @xmath35 may be obtained as follows .",
    "the number of radiating electrons scales as @xmath36 , and the number of photons each electron emits per unit time in the shell frame is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath31 .",
    "the time in the shell frame over which the shock propagates a distance @xmath35 is @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the number of photons emitted scales as @xmath38 . using ( [ gamma ] )",
    "we therefore have @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant with dimensions of length .",
    "the shock heated gas expands relativistically in its rest frame .",
    "since the time , measured in the rest frame , for the shock to expand to radius @xmath2 is @xmath41 , relativistic expansion in the shell frame implies that the rest frame thickness of the shell of shock heated gas is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in the observer frame most of the shocked gas , and most of the blast wave energy , are concentrated in a shell of thickness @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is some constant .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of @xmath44 by assuming that the density in the shocked shell is uniform . in this case conservation of particle number",
    "implies @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . in the self - similar solutions of ( @xcite ) , which give the spatial dependence of the hydrodynamic variables , @xmath47 of the energy",
    "is concentrated in a shell of thickness corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "it is implicitly assumed in fireball afterglow models that the fractions of energy carried by electrons and magnetic field vary behind the shock over a length scale comparable to the scale for changes in the hydrodynamic variables , @xmath49 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons is longer than the dynamical time , i.e. the characteristic expansion time .",
    "if the energy fractions vary behind the shock on a scale much shorter than @xmath49 , due to some non hydrodynamic process which is not accounted for , a new length scale would be introduced into the problem and the scalings ( [ nu ] ) , on which the fireball afterglow model relies , will no longer hold .",
    "since the details of the spatial dependence of the electron and magnetic field energy fractions are not known , we will assume below that radiation is produced within a homogeneous shell of width @xmath49 behind the shock , and will derive results for different values of @xmath44 . for clarity",
    "we first assume that at a fixed time all emitted photons have the same energy ( in the fireball frame ) .",
    "we then discuss modifications expected due to a finite frequency range of emitted photons .    in the shell frame photons",
    "are emitted isotropically .",
    "consider , therefore , the appearance of an isotropic distribution of photons of frequency @xmath11 in a frame moving with lorentz factor @xmath0 with respect to the frame where the distribution is isotropic .",
    "we refer to the frame where the distribution is isotropic as the `` rest frame '' . denoting with primes quantities measured in the moving frame ,",
    "the rest frame and moving frame frequencies are related by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the ( rest frame ) angle between the photon momentum and the direction of motion of the moving frame .",
    "the angle measured in the moving frame is @xmath53 the fraction @xmath54 of photons with frequencies in the range @xmath55 to @xmath56 is @xmath57 here , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    let us now consider photons observed by a distant observer in a frequency range @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the number of photons produced by the fireball shell at radius @xmath2 , with observed frequency in the range @xmath55 to @xmath56 , is given by ( [ nu ] ) and ( [ df ] ) @xmath60 where we have approximated @xmath61 in ( [ df ] ) , as we are interested in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "any photon which arrives at a distant observer must be emitted from the fireball in a direction parallel to the source - observer line of sight .",
    "a photon emitted at radius @xmath2 , with frequency @xmath19 in the shell frame , is observed with frequency @xmath55 provided , therefore , it is emitted from the fireball on a line emerging from the explosion center and making an angle @xmath63 , given by ( [ thetap ] ) and ( [ nup ] ) , with the source - observer line of sight .",
    "such a photon is delayed with respect to photons emitted on the line of sight by @xmath64 \\quad{\\buildrel{\\gamma\\rightarrow\\infty}\\over\\longrightarrow}\\quad { r\\over2\\gamma^2 c}\\left(2\\gamma{\\nu\\over\\nu'}-1\\right ) .",
    "\\label{t_theta}\\ ] ] the total delay , i.e. the delay with respect to photons emitted from the center of the explosion @xmath65 , is given by the sum of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the difference between light travel time to radius @xmath2 and shock expansion time to radius @xmath2 , @xmath68 .",
    "for the scaling ( [ gamma ] ) we have , for @xmath62 and using @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the delay of photons emitted from the shock front at radius @xmath2 , and observed with frequency @xmath55 , with respect to photons emitted from the center of the explosion @xmath65 , is @xmath71 since photons are emitted uniformly from a shell of finite thickness @xmath72 behind the shock , the arrival times of photons emitted at radius @xmath2 and observed with frequency @xmath55 are uniformly distributed ( for @xmath62 ) over the range @xmath73 to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . using ( [ dn][t_o ] )",
    "we have numerically calculated the intensity ( energy flux per unit frequency ) @xmath76 as a function of time .",
    "results are shown in fig . 1 for different values of the shell thickness , @xmath77 .",
    "1 presents the time dependent flux at @xmath78 .",
    "the intensity at other frequencies is obtained using the scaling @xmath79 . \\label{scaling}\\ ] ] for the shell width expected from fireball hydrodynamics , @xmath80 , the intensity peaks at frequency @xmath18 at a time @xmath81 .",
    "the numeric coefficient in this relation , @xmath82 , is somewhat smaller than the commonly used value , @xmath83 .",
    "however , as explained above , since the spatial dependence of the fractions of energy carried by electrons and magnetic field is not known , the effective shell width @xmath44 can not be determined exactly ( as it is not determined by the hydrodynamics only ) , and therefore the value of the coefficient in the relation @xmath81 can not be determined exactly .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the intensity peaks at @xmath18 at a delay significantly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "1 were obtained under the assumption that at a fixed shell radius all emitted photons have the same frequency @xmath19 ( in the fireball frame ) . in fireball afterglow models the emission peaks at @xmath19 , and extends to high frequency @xmath84 due to power - law energy distribution of electrons , and to low frequency @xmath85 due to the low energy tail of synchrotron emission , @xmath86\\sim[\\nu/\\nu(r)]^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "these tails dominate the intensity at observed frequency @xmath18 at delays much smaller and much larger than the time at which the intensity peaks at @xmath55 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , they are not important near the peak , @xmath89 .",
    "the details of the frequency dependence of the emission at @xmath90 will affect the behavior at @xmath89 .",
    "let us assume that photons are emitted at the shell frame at two different frequencies , @xmath19 as given in ( [ nu ] ) and @xmath91 .",
    "it is straight forward to show that the intensity @xmath92 due to emission at @xmath93 is related to that of the intensity @xmath94 due to emission at @xmath19 by @xmath95 .",
    "thus , if most of the energy is emitted in the shell frame over a frequency range @xmath96 , the frequency spread would introduce a spread in arrival time of photons of frequency @xmath55 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the time at which the intensity peaks under the assumption that all photons are emitted at the same frequency @xmath19 . from fig .",
    "1 , the spread in arrival time due to the relativistic expansion is @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the effect of emission over a finite frequency range would not be significant , provided most of the energy is emitted over a frequency range @xmath100 .",
    "the flux observed at a fixed time originates from points at a range of distances transverse to the line of sight . using the equations derived above we have numerically calculated the fraction of flux contributed from rings of radii @xmath101@xmath102 around the line of sight , as function of @xmath101 .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 2 for several @xmath44 values . at time",
    "@xmath3 the flux originates from a ring of outer radius @xmath103 and width @xmath6 . note that this result is independent of the spectral distribution of the emission in the shell frame",
    "the appearance of the fireball as a narrow ring can be qualitatively understood from fig .",
    "3 . radiation produced at @xmath30 and observed at @xmath104 originates from an angle @xmath105 , corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "contribution to the emission at smaller @xmath101 is due to emission from @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "however , the contribution from smaller radii is suppressed due to the fact that at smaller radii the radiation seen at a given time originates from larger angles , and the relativistic beaming suppresses the emission from angles @xmath109 . the contribution from larger",
    "radii is small since the emissivity decreases as the fireball decelerates .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the implications of the relativistic hydrodynamics of expanding blast waves to grb afterglow observations .",
    "we have shown that the afterglow intensity peaks at observed frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the frequency at which the emission peaks in the fireball frame at radius @xmath2 , at time @xmath81 .",
    "the exact value of the numerical coefficient depends on the effective thickness of the radiating shell , @xmath110 .",
    "the value @xmath82 is obtained for @xmath80 , the value implied by fireball hydrodynamics ( see fig .",
    "the numeric coefficient , @xmath82 , is somewhat smaller than the commonly used value , @xmath83 .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that since the spatial dependence of the fractions of energy carried by electrons and magnetic field is not known , the effective shell width @xmath44 can not be determined exactly , and the numerical coefficient may be somewhat larger or smaller then @xmath82 .",
    "the amplitude of the peak intensity agrees with the estimate of ( @xcite , b ) . for the intensity normalization chosen in fig .",
    "1 , the peak intensity estimated following ( @xcite , b ) is @xmath111 , close to the numerical results obtained here .",
    "this is due to the fact that most photons of frequency @xmath18 arrive over a time scale @xmath112 , as assumed in ( @xcite , b ) .    at time",
    "@xmath1 the fireball appears on the sky as a narrow ring of radius @xmath5 and width @xmath6 , where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are related by @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "the apparent size @xmath5 is smaller by a factor of @xmath113 compared to that obtained by using the relation @xmath4 ( this follows from [ [ gamma ] ] ) .",
    "the smaller size implies that diffractive scintillation is likely to modulate the afterglow radio flux ( @xcite ) , and that significant modification of the optical light curve due to microlensing is possible on day time scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "the narrowness of the emission ring would affect the predictions for both microlensing and scintillation ( this has been taken into account in the lensing calculations of [ @xcite ] .",
    "more detailed calculations are required for modulation by scintillation ) .",
    "the results presented here are valid for highly relativistic fireballs , @xmath62 . for lorentz factors",
    "@xmath114 , the emission ring would be wider .",
    "finally , we note that although we have implicitly assumed spherical symmetry throughout the paper , our results are valid for a fireball which is a cone of finite opening angle @xmath52 as long as @xmath115 .",
    "this is due to the fact that most of the observed emission originates from a cone of opening angle @xmath116 .",
