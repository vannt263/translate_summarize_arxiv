    "studies of the atomic interstellar medium ( ism ) , through observations of the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) , have proven to be critical for our understanding of the processes leading to star formation , the dynamics and structure of the ism , and the ( dark ) matter distribution ; thus touching on major issues related to galaxy formation . in the last decades",
    "remarkable progress has been made in these areas .",
    "however , the lack of high - resolution hi observations in a representative sample of nearbly galaxies precludes a systematic study of the physical characteristics of the atomic ism .    here",
    "we present first maps of things , ` the hi nearby galaxy survey ' , the largest program ever undertaken at the vla to perform 21-cm atomic hydrogen observations of the highest quality of nearby galaxies .",
    "the goal of things is to obtain high - quality observations of the atomic ism ( through observations of the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen ) of a substantial sample of nearby galaxies , covering a wide range of hubble types , star formation rates , absolute luminosities , evolutionary stages , and metallicities .",
    "the database will have homogeneous sensitivity and spatial and velocity resolution at the limit of what can currently be achieved with the very large array .",
    "the angular resolution will be @xmath3 , and the spectral resolution will be @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "all galaxies will be observed with the vla b , c and d arrays .",
    "a more complete description of things , survey parameters and observational and technical details will be presented in walter et al .  .",
    "a list of sample targets is given in table 1 .",
    "as an example of the high quality of the things data , figs .  1 and 2 show high - resolution integrated hi column density maps of four galaxies from the sample .",
    "data from things will complement sings , the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey @xcite ; hence high - quality observations from the x - ray through the radio will be available at comparable resolution for each galaxy .",
    "data from things can be used to investigate issues such as the small - scale and three - dimensional structure of the ism , the ( dark ) matter distribution , and the processes leading to star formation .",
    "furthermore , things will enable studies of the variation of each of these properties as a function of galaxy environment .",
    "things is designed to address numerous scientific topics , including , but not limited to , the following :    * * dust  atomic ism . *",
    "the resolution of the things hi data is similar to that obtained for the intermediate wavelength bands on - board spitzer .",
    "one of the main goals of things is therefore a comparison between the spatial distributions of the hi and dust as measured by spitzer . * * interplay ism  star formation .",
    "* things allows studies of the interplay between star formation and the ambient ism at 100 - 300 pc resolution over a range of hubble types .",
    "the location and energy input of regions of recent star formation and the impact they have on the structure and dynamics of the hi will be investigated .",
    "for example , for the first time a census will be possible of supergiant shells as a function of hubble type .",
    "things data products will enable studies of how these structures form and how they , in turn , might trigger secondary star formation . using the multi  wavelength data from sings a complete energy budget of the ism can be derived . * * global mass distribution . *",
    "the things data products will enable studies of the dark matter distribution in galaxies at high angular resolution .",
    "high resolution data near the centres of galaxies are especially important as this is the regime where differences between the cuspy and constant - density haloes show themselves most clearly .",
    "the data from spitzer and additional data at other wavelengths will deliver more reliable estimates for the stellar mass  to  light ratio of the disk , obviating the need to resort to the `` canonical '' maximum disk assumption in order to derive the properties of the dark matter halo .",
    "this study will ultimately shed more light on the validity of the cdm paradigm on scales of individual galaxies and will measure possible trends of the dark matter properties as a function of hubble type . *",
    "* star formation threshold . * using things , studies will be performed at high spatial resolution to investigate whether or not there is a ` universal ' star formation threshold and how , or even if , this is a function of galaxy type .",
    "combinations of things hi surface density maps with co data will allow one to create total gas surface density maps . amongst other things , with the velocity dispersion maps and the derived rotation curves , this information can be used to calculate spatially resolved `` toomre@xmath4 '' parameter maps for each galaxy ( the @xmath4 parameter is a measure for the local gravitational balance , @xcite ) as a function of hubble type .",
    "issues that can be addressed are , e.g. , in which regime does ` @xmath4 ' break down ?",
    "what is the importance of local ( disk or cloud instability ) versus global effects ( spiral density waves , tidal forces ) ?",
    "obervations for things are currently ongoing at the vla ( total observing time : @xmath5 hours , including archival data ) .",
    "the data acquisition will be completed at the end of 2005 .",
    "final data products of things will include moment maps ( integrated hi distribution , velocity fields , velocity dispersion ) as well as the hi data cubes , and will be made available to the community one year after the observations have completed .",
