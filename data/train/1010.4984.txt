    "water is ubiquitous is biological systems .",
    "it is a major component of cells and participates in the majority of the biological processes .",
    "it is usually considered essential for life , but it is still under debate why @xcite .",
    "one possible reason is that water has many properties that are unusual with respect to other liquids @xcite .",
    "the anomalous behavior of water is evident in the liquid phase .",
    "for example , fluctuations of volume and fluctuations of entropy have a minimum for liquid water , while in usual liquids they decrease when the temperature @xmath0 is decreased .",
    "volume fluctuations can be observed by measuring the compressibility @xmath1 , defined as how much the volume changes when the pressure @xmath2 is changed at constant @xmath0 , and entropy fluctuations are proportional to the specif heat @xmath3 at constant @xmath2 . for water at ambient pressure @xmath1 has a minimum at @xmath4c and @xmath3 at minimum at @xmath5c .",
    "the anomalies of water become more evident when @xmath0 is decreased toward and below @xmath6c . for example",
    ", water has a maximum in density at @xmath7c .",
    "normal liquids , such as argon , reduce their density when the temperature decreases and reach their maximum density when they solidify in a crystal .",
    "water , instead , below @xmath7c expands .",
    "therefore , liquid water at @xmath6c has a density smaller than water at @xmath7c . by solidifying into ice",
    ", water expands even further , becoming `` lighter '' . for this reason ice cubes float in a glass of water",
    "this property has a dramatic consequence in processes such as the cryopreservation of biological cells , because the large amount of water in each cell expands when forms ice and breaks the cell .",
    "another property of water that is relevant in these conditions is that water can stay in its liquid state even at @xmath8c , i.e. it can be supercooled below its melting temperature .",
    "bulk water can be supercooled to @xmath9c at atmospheric pressure , but in different conditions water can remain liquid even at lower temperatures .",
    "for example , it can be supercooled down to @xmath10c when confined in vegetable fibers , or down to @xmath11c when compressed at @xmath12  kbars .",
    "an anti - freezing effect can be achieved also by dissolving in water polymers or proteins , with several practical applications . understanding the details of this phenomena and how to regulate",
    "it could be very relevant for cryopreservation , food storage and refrigeration @xcite .",
    "also in its solid state , water is peculiar .",
    "water is a polymorph with many different crystal phases , more than fifteen , some of which are stable only at pressure @xmath13  gpa . but water can easily form a solid that is not a crystal .",
    "if quenched rapidly below @xmath14c at ambient pressure , liquid water freezes in a metastable amorphous state , which is an arrested liquid configuration @xcite . at low pressure water forms a low - density amorphous ( lda ) state @xcite , while at high pressure it forms a high - density amorphous ( hda ) state @xcite , separated by a volume discontinuity of @xmath15% , comparable to that between crystalline ice i and ice vi .",
    "a smaller discontinuity has been observed more recently @xcite , but its interpretation is under debate .",
    "the discontinuities between amorphous states at different densities and the fact that quantities such as @xmath1 or @xmath3 largely increase in the supercooled state , show that water has a complex behavior at low @xmath0 .",
    "this observation and the fact that water remains in its liquid state at very low @xmath0 when in contact with organic or inorganic interfaces suggest that water could play a main role in phenomena such as the so - called protein glass transition , or the protein cold denaturation at low temperature .      to explore how the dynamics of proteins and water are related , s - h .",
    "chen et al . in 2006 studied by high  resolution quasi  elastic neutron scattering ( quens ) the structure and dynamics of water molecules in the hydration layer surrounding lysozyme proteins at temperatures around @xmath16  k ( @xmath17c ) @xcite .",
    "below this temperature the protein is in a solid  like `` glassy state '' , with no conformational flexibility and no biological functions . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the protein displays a harmonic atomic motion that , in hydrated proteins , suddenly becomes anharmonic and liquid - like at about @xmath16  k. the change in the protein dynamics is believed to be triggered by the coupling with the hydration water through the hydrogen bonds because the hydration water displays a dynamic transition at a similar @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "chen interpreted the hydration water dynamic transition as a change in a main structural relaxation and recently extended this interpretation to hydrated proteins at high - pressure .",
    "this explanation has been questioned by swenson et al .",
    "@xcite . by using dielectric measurements on myoglobin in water - glycerol mixtures",
    ", they found a dynamic crossover at about @xmath18  k and they interpreted it as an evidence that local ( secondary ) protein motions are controlled ( slaved ) by the local fluctuations in the hydration shell , as proposed by fenimore et al . in 2004",
    "@xcite based on mssbauer and neutron - scattering experiments .    on the other hand , pawlus et al .",
    "in 2008 , based on measurement of conductivity on hydrated lysozyme , found no crossover around @xmath16  k. they also ascribe the apparent crossover observed with qens to a secondary relaxation and to a lack of resolution on main structural relaxation of qens @xcite .",
    "more recently nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments on water hydrating elastin and collagen , performed by vogel , showed no crossover at @xmath16  k but a crossover at about @xmath18  k. this data have been interpreted as consistent with thermally activated tetrahedral jump motion of hydration water @xcite .",
    "these and other experiments , therefore , show that it is difficult to achieve a clear understanding of the protein - hydration water coupling solely based on the experimental data . a possible way to gain further insight is offered by the numerical results of detailed computer simulations .      in 2006",
    "kumar et al .",
    "@xcite , by simulating lysozyme or dna surrounded by water represented with the tip5p model , found a dynamic transition of the macromolecules at about the same temperature of a dynamic crossover in the diffusivity of hydration water , in the range",
    "@xmath19  k@xmath20  k. they also show numerical indications that this crossover coincides with the maximum of the isobaric specific heat of the whole system and the maximum fluctuations in tetrahedral order of the hydration water .",
    "this observation was confirmed in 2008 by lagi et al .",
    "@xcite . they found a strong crossover in the water translational ( @xmath21 ) relaxation time and in the inverse of its self - diffusion constant at about @xmath22  k , by simulating hydrated lysozyme with water represented by the tip4p - ew model .",
    "they corroborate that the crossover corresponds to the maximum structural change , and they found a low activation energy , showing consistency with the neutron scattering and the nmr experiments .",
    "nevertheless , in 2009 this view was disputed by vogel @xcite . by simulating elastin or collagen hydrated by spc - water",
    "he found only a weak crossover in the hydration water correlation time at about @xmath18  k and a high activation energy associated to a secondary relaxation , consistent with activation energies determined in dielectric spectroscopy and nmr studies .",
    "it is evident from these and other numerical studies that the comparison of experiments with simulation is useful , but is not enough to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the coupling of the water dynamics with the biomolecules dynamics .",
    "in particular , the difficulties in finding clear answers to the open questions rise for the fact that experiments and numerical results are both affected by errors and uncertainties . therefore , it is natural to look for a theory that could be able to find exact relations and make predictions to test in further experiments .    in the next section",
    "we describe a model for a hydration water monolayer that allows to develop a theory for these phenomena and to predict properties that could be verified in experiments .",
    "the model , moreover , allows for efficient simulations whose results complement the theoretical analysis . in section 3",
    "we review results of this tractable model , including new data for the density and energy distributions at different pressures and very low temperature ( subsection 3.3 ) and for the hydration percolation ( subsection 3.4 ) . in section 4",
    "we discuss new results about protein stability and confined water in the context of food processing and cells in living organism . in section 5 we give our conclusive remarks and we discuss possible extensions of this model .",
    "we first consider the case of water nanoconfined between two hydrophobic surfaces .",
    "to fix the idea , let s consider the case with a distance @xmath23  nm between the two surfaces . because the confining surfaces are hydrophobic , the water molecules will not form hydrogen bonds ( hb ) with the surfaces .",
    "experiments shows that in bulk each water molecule is surrounded by four nearest neighbor molecules at a distance of about @xmath24   with a structure that resembles that of a tetrahedron at low @xmath0v and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hence , one would expect that each water molecule between the two hydrophobic plates will adjust in a way to form a distorted network of hbs with each molecules surrounded by other four .",
    "this has been indeed found by kumar et al .",
    "@xcite by simulating tip5p - water in these conditions .    to define a tractable model @xcite , we coarse - grain the structure described above , dividing the slab of space occupied by water into cells with volume @xmath25 , with a square section of size @xmath26 , where @xmath27  @xcite is the closest approach ( van der waals ) distance between water molecules ( fig",
    ".  [ schematic ] )",
    ". if the density of water is @xmath28 , and the number of water molecules in @xmath29 , the water volume is @xmath30 .",
    "if the system is uniform and we divide the system in @xmath29 cells , each cell has on average one water molecule .",
    "more in general if the system is not uniform , some cells can be empty or each cell can occupy a different volume @xmath31 and the distance @xmath32 between two molecules in the cells @xmath33 and @xmath33 is the distance between their centers .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 and @xmath33 are the indices of nearest neighbor cells , the distance between the molecules in these cells is @xmath35 .",
    "we describe the isotropic ( e.g. , van der waals ) attractive and repulsive interactions between the molecules by a standard a lennard - jones interaction @xmath36   \\label{u0}\\ ] ] where @xmath37  kj / mol  @xcite is the attractive energy and the sum is over all the possible pairs of molecules @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "some modifications of this interaction , such as the introduction of a maximum cut - off distance or a hard - core distance , have been adopted in previous analysis of this model @xcite to simplify the numerical simulations .",
    "for the theoretical analysis , instead , this interaction term has been replaced by a more tractable discrete interaction @xcite .    to take into account the energy and entropy variation",
    "when water molecules form hbs , we introduce for each water molecule @xmath34 four bonding indices @xmath38 , one for each of the possible hbs with the four nearest neighbor water molecules @xmath33 .",
    "the index can assume @xmath39 different states , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a parameter whose value we will discuss in the following .",
    "therefore , each water molecule has @xmath42 possible states , that can be interpreted as possible rotational configurations .",
    "the total number of configurations for the system is @xmath43 , that for @xmath44 ( the maximum number that we have considered in our analysis ) is an astronomical number ( about @xmath45 ) .",
    "when a molecule forms a hb the number of its accessible configurations decreases , and the energy of the system is reduced .    to estimate the decrease in the number of accessible configurations",
    ", we observe that a hb is broken if it deviates from a linear bond more than @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , only @xmath47 of the whole continuous range of orientations @xmath48 $ ] in the oh  o plane are associated to a bonded state .",
    "hence , @xmath49 of the possible configurations are not  bonded . by allowing @xmath41 possible states for each bonding index @xmath38",
    ", we can count correctly the entropy loss associated to the formation of a hb if only one out of @xmath39 states corresponds to a hb .",
    "this is achieved by allowing the formation of the hb between molecules @xmath34 and @xmath33 only if @xmath50 , where by definition @xmath51 if @xmath52 and @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "next , we take into account that a hb is broken if the oh  o distance is too large @xcite . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "we introduce a condition on the o ",
    "o distance @xmath54 , allowing the formation of hb only if @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . therefore , considering that the length of the oh covalent bond is @xmath57  @xcite , the maximum bond length is @xmath58 , consistent with other choices in literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , we impose this condition by introducing a discrete variable @xmath59 for each cell @xmath34 , with @xmath60 if @xmath61 , otherwise @xmath62 .",
    "a cell with @xmath60 is liquid - like because its ( dimensionless ) density @xmath63 , while a cell with @xmath62 is gas - like because has @xmath64 .",
    "hence , we define the number of hbs as @xmath65 where the symbol @xmath66 denotes that the sum is performed over nearest neighbor cells @xmath34 and @xmath33 .    from the experiments we know the formation of hbs leads to an open network of molecules with , on average , four neighbors instead of",
    "twelve as in argon - like fluids .",
    "the resulting volume per molecule with hbs is larger than the volume per molecule with no hbs .",
    "this is observable as the anomalous density decrease described in the introduction , that is a consequence of the formation of a macroscopic number of hbs .",
    "this effect is incorporated in the model by considering the total water volume to be given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the water volume in absence of hbs , and @xmath69 is the increase of volume per hb . to estimate the parameter @xmath69 , we consider as reference values the increase between the density @xmath70  g/@xmath71 of the ice ih at atmospheric pressure and ice vi , with density @xmath72  g/@xmath71 , or ice ice viii , with density @xmath73  g/@xmath71 .",
    "ice ih is characterized by hexagonal rings of hbs with an almost perfect tetrahedral structure , while ice vi and ice viii have a structure consisting of two interpenetrating tetrahedral networks of hbs .",
    "the relative increase of density in these cases is equal to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "hence , in the model we set the relative hb increase of volume per molecule equal to the average between the previous reference values , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "note that this increase of volume per molecule is due to a decrease of first neighbors and does not imply an increase of distance between molecules .",
    "our model , being coarse - grained , does not include all the details about the structure , but maintains the increase of volume per molecule with no effect on the distance @xmath54 between molecules .",
    "in particular , the hb volume increase does not affect the calculation of @xmath77 of eq.([u0 ] ) .",
    "the formation of a hb leads to an energy gain , represented in the model by an interaction term @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the characteristic energy of the covalent ( directional ) component of the hb .",
    "this term only accounts for the two  body component of the hb interaction .",
    "however , in water many  body effects are relevant and , in particular , the three  body term  @xcite .",
    "this can be observed from the @xmath0-dependence of the o  o  o angle distribution .",
    "this distribution becomes sharper around the tetrahedral angle when @xmath0 decreases @xcite .",
    "hence , we include in the model the many  body ( cooperative ) effect due to hbs @xcite , which minimizes the energy when the hbs of nearby molecules optimize the tetrahedral orientation .",
    "this is accomplished by further adding to the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) and ( [ hb ] ) the term @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the characteristic energy of the cooperative component of the h bond , and the sum over @xmath82 is performed over all the six different pairs of the four bonding indices of molecule @xmath34 .    as discussed by stokely et al .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ hb ] ) and ( [ coop ] ) have two free parameters : @xmath79 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "experiments estimate the hb in ice ih to be @xmath83 kj / mol stronger than in liquid water  @xcite . attributing this increase to a cooperative interaction among hbs @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the value of @xmath81 in the cell model to be @xmath84 kj /mol , because for each hb there would be @xmath85 pairs of @xmath81interactions .",
    "the optimal hb energy , @xmath86 , has been measured to be @xmath87 kj / mol  @xcite . by considering tetrahedral clusters of h - bonded molecules , with hb and van der waals interactions up to the third nearest neighbor molecules ,",
    "the value for the directional component of the hb is estimated by stokely et al . @xcite as @xmath88 kj / mol .",
    "other experimental estimates suggest that breaking the directional component of the hb requires @xmath89 kj / mol  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , a reasonable estimate to set @xmath90 and to consider @xmath79 as the only free parameter of the model .    in the following",
    "we will briefly summarize some recent results for this model , to show that it reproduces in a qualitative way the properties of water .",
    "an appropriate choice of the free parameter @xmath79 leads to results that , as for more detailed models , can be fairly rescaled on the known proprieties of a water monolayer . in this respect , this model is not better then detailed models , but , it has two features that detailed models have not .",
    "i ) it is less computationally expensive , because it is coarse - grained .",
    "this allows to simulate very large number of water molecules ( about a million ) on simple desktop computers in a few hours .",
    "ii ) more importantly and differently from the detailed models , this model is tractable for theoretical calculations . the trade - off for these advantages is that the model is coarse - grained and can not give informations about some properties of water , such as the structure . nevertheless , works is in progress to overcome this limitation .",
    "we study the model described in the previous section by mean  field ( mf ) analysis and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the mf approach follows the bethe - peierls and the cavity method @xcite , by expressing the molar gibbs free energy in terms of an exact partition function for a portion of the system , and taking into account the effect of all the rest of the system as a mean field acting on the border of this portion , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mc simulations are performed at constant @xmath29 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , allowing the volume @xmath68 in eq.([vol ] ) to fluctuate as a stochastic variable . to minimize the boundary effects",
    ", we consider periodic boundary conditions in the directions parallel to the confining surfaces . to study the thermodynamic properties of the model we adopt an efficient cluster mc dynamics , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , or a continuous @xmath0 algorithm , the histogram reweighting method , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . to study the dynamics of the hbs",
    "we adopt a standard metropolis algorithm @xcite , while to study the diffusion properties we use the kawasaki algorithm @xcite .      for water nanoconfined between hydrophobic plates , the model display a gas ",
    "liquid first - order phase transition ending in a critical point @xmath91 , that qualitatively resembles the gas  liquid transition for bulk water ( fig .",
    "[ rho]a ) . in their work ,",
    "de los santos et al .",
    "verify that the water diffusion constant @xmath92 decreases when water changes from gas to liquid .",
    "the change in @xmath92 is strong far from the critical point @xmath91 , and it disappears at @xmath91 . in the liquid phase ,",
    "de los santos et al .",
    "@xcite observe that , as for bulk water , the nanoconfined system has a region in the @xmath2@xmath0 plane where @xmath92 increases for increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is an anomaly of water , because in normal fluids @xmath92 decreases for increasing @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this anomalous behavior is qualitatively rationalized as a consequence of the hb formation and it has been observed both in bulk and confined water @xcite .",
    "at lower temperature , by decreasing @xmath0 at constant @xmath2 the model displays the line of temperatures of maximum density ( tmd ) @xcite , as in the bulk case ( fig .",
    "[ rho]a ) .",
    "the tmd line in the @xmath2@xmath0 plane has a positive slope at low @xmath2 and negative slope at high @xmath2 .",
    "the nanoconfinement does not allows the formation of crystal ice .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to calculate where in the @xmath2@xmath0 plane @xmath93 is constant and to show that the lines of constant-@xmath92 qualitatively resemble the melting line of bulk water @xcite .      at low @xmath0",
    "the diffusion constant largely decreases and , eventually , the monolayer becomes subdiffusive , i.e. the mean square displacement of water molecules never reach the diffusive regime @xcite .",
    "this property has been observed experimentally below @xmath94  k by neutron scattering in a monolayer of water hydrating a myoglobin surface at low hydration level ( @xmath95  g h@xmath96o / g of protein ) , corresponding to a number of water molecules sufficient to cover the entire protein surface @xcite .",
    "franzese and de los santos in 2009 @xcite found that a water monolayer partially hydrating a hydrophobic surface , described by the model considered here , would display a very slow dynamics for the hbs at low @xmath2 and @xmath0 . in these conditions",
    "the hb correlation function @xmath97 , that quantifies how much the hbs are correlated in time , is almost not changing in time , showing that the water dynamics is completely frozen .",
    "hence , water is in its glassy state at low @xmath0 and low @xmath2 , consistent with the observed freezing of the incoherent intermediate scattering function of water hydrating myoglobin at hydration level @xmath98  g h@xmath96o / g of protein at about @xmath99  k  @xcite .",
    "glassy water is observed also in bulk , but below @xmath100  k.    this slowing down of the dynamics is well understood in our model where , at low @xmath0 and low @xmath2 , the number of hbs largely increases when the @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this progressive building up of the hb network traps the water molecules in a percolating network of hbs that leaves small areas of the hydrophobic surface completely dehydrated .    at higher",
    "@xmath2 the decreased number of hb allows to the small dry cavities to slowly equilibrate , due to large - scale rearrangements of the hbs and leading to partial dehydration of the surface . in this case water",
    "can slowly flow on the surface because the high pressure reduces the volume per molecules and disfavors the formation of hbs .",
    "hence , the hb network builds up at lower @xmath0 with respect to the low pressure condition @xcite . in this case the long time behavior of @xmath97 is well described by a stretched exponential function @xmath101 \\label{stretched}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are fitting constant . for @xmath105",
    "the function is exponential , and the more stretched is the function , the smaller is the exponent @xmath106 .",
    "franzese and de los santos  @xcite predicted that at low @xmath2 , by increasing @xmath2 , ( i ) the time needed for the hbs to decorrelate decreases , i.e. water can relax more rapidly , and ( ii ) the @xmath107 exponent decreases going from @xmath108 to @xmath109 for a pressure approaching a characteristic value @xmath110 .",
    "we will discuss further about @xmath110 in the following . by increasing the pressure even further , for @xmath111 ,",
    "the hb correlation function relaxes faster and the exponent becomes @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath97 becomes an exponential function .",
    "the prediction about @xmath107 is consistent with the experimental findings of settles and doster showing that , for water hydrating myoglobin at low hydration level , the incoherent intermediate scattering function at large @xmath112 vector , i.e. the dynamics of density fluctuations at short distance , are well described by stretched exponential functions with @xmath107 varying between @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath94  k @xcite .",
    "we observe that the theoretical lower limit for @xmath107 is expected to be @xmath115 @xcite and that @xmath116 is a measure of the heterogeneity in the system .",
    "therefore , the prediction  @xcite that the stretching parameter @xmath107 approaches its smallest possible value when the pressure tends to @xmath110 implies that the water monolayer reaches its maximum in heterogeneity at @xmath110 . in the following we will discuss further this point .      to understand the origin of the heterogeneity at @xmath110 , we recall here that the properties of water are consistent with theories that propose different mechanisms and different phase behaviors at very low temperature ( approximately @xmath100  k@xmath117  k ) .",
    "at these temperatures , supercooled bulk water forms ice , while confined water in appropriate conditions can be kept liquid @xcite .",
    "the different theories can be summarized in four possible scenarios for the @xmath118 phase diagram .",
    "\\(i ) in the _ stability limit _ ( sl ) scenario  @xcite it is hypothesized that the limits of stability of superheated - stretched liquid water changes its slope in the @xmath2@xmath0 plane from positive at high @xmath0 , to negative at low @xmath0 and negative @xmath2 , giving as a consequence the anomalous increase at low @xmath0 of quantities such as @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath119 .",

    "the low - density - liquid ( ldl ) , high - density - liquid ( hdl ) critical point @xmath120 has been predicted at positive @xmath2 @xcite or negative @xmath2  @xcite , depending on the water model adopted in simulations .",
    "the anomalies of water are the consequence of approaching @xmath120 .",
    "\\(iii ) in the _ singularity  free _ ( sf ) scenario  @xcite it is hypothesized that the hbs have no cooperativity . in this case",
    "it is shown that the anomalous increase of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath119 is a consequence of the low-@xmath0 anticorrelation between volume and entropy , also responsible for negative slope in the @xmath2@xmath0 plane of the line of temperatures of maximum density ( tmd ) .",
    "\\(iv ) in the  _ critical  point free _ ( cpf ) scenario @xcite it is hypothesized that the ldl - hdl first ",

    "the hdl has a superheated - stretched limit of stability similar to that predicted in scenario ( i ) .    as discussed by stokely et al .",
    "@xcite , it is still unclear which of the scenarios best describes water , because there is no definitive experimental test . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same tractable model presented in the previous section is analyzed by means of theoretical calculations and numerical simulations , showing that the four scenarios ( i)(iv ) may be mapped in the space of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath81 , representing the strength of the hb directional component and the strength of the hb cooperative component , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath90 discussed at the end of the previous section , and based on estimates from experimental data , supports the prediction of a liquid  liquid critical point @xmath120 at positive pressure for supercooled water ( fig.[rho]b ) .",
    "the model allows to distinguish the ldl phase and the hdl phase by their different densities and characteristic energies .",
    "the presence of two maxima in the distributions of these quantities marks the coexistence of the two phases and corresponds to the occurrence of two minima in the free energy of the system ( fig.[histograms ] ) .    at the critical point",
    "@xmath120 the cooperativity of the hbs is maximum .",
    "hence , cooperative rearrangements of the hb are necessary to allow the relaxation of the dynamics .",
    "these rearrangements occur on different length - scales , each associated with a different time - scale . as a consequence",
    "a single time - scale can not be defined for the dynamics , resulting in a stretched decay of the correlation function , i.e. in heterogeneous dynamics .",

    "if @xmath130 , an index can be added , with probability @xmath131 , to the cluster only if it is in the same state as the other indices already in the cluster . instead , if @xmath132 , the index can be added only if it is in a different state with respect to the index to whom it will be connected . *",
    "the third step is to randomly select a bonding indices on the border of the cluster and pick at random one of the indices on the same molecule , or the facing index on a bonded molecule , that is not already in the cluster , and to include it in the cluster with probability @xmath133 or @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "this step is repeated until all the possible directions of growth for the cluster have been considered .",
    "the resulting cluster statistically represents the region of correlated hbs , as can be shown @xcite , and its characteristic linear size statistically corresponds to the correlation length of the water molecules .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of the liquid - liquid critical point , where the correlation length increases , it is possible to observe that the size of the clusters of correlated water molecules increases . at the liquid - liquid critical point",
    "the correlation length diverges and a cluster of correlated water molecules spans ( percolate ) the whole monolayer .",
    "general results on correlated percolation theory allow to find mathematical relations between thermodynamics quantities and percolation quantities .",
    "in particular , it can been shown that the mean size of the clusters defined above diverges with the same power ",
    "law exponent as the compressibility of water and that the distribution of number @xmath134 of finite cluster of size @xmath135 per water molecule is exponential far from the liquid - liquid critical point @xmath120 , while follows a power law with exponent @xmath103 near @xmath120 . from general considerations it is possible to show that @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the effective dimensionality of the monolayer and @xmath138 is the fractal dimension of the clusters @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimate of @xmath139 suggests that the clusters of correlated water molecules are compact with @xmath140 ( fig.[ns ] ) @xcite .",
    "since the compressibility is proportional to the density fluctuations , the clusters allows for a geometrical analysis of the diverging density fluctuations near the liquid - liquid critical point @xcite .",
    "the density fluctuations are observable also far from the liquid - liquid critical point @xmath120 .",
    "in particular , they can be observed along a line in the @xmath2@xmath0 phase diagram that emanates from @xmath120 into the one - phase region and marks the maxima of the correlation length .",
    "this line has been named after widom @xcite and can be characterized in the study of hydrated protein .",
    "for example , kumar et al .",
    "@xcite used the tractable model described above to investigate the case of a percolating monolayer of water molecules adsorbed on a protein surface , with hydration level about @xmath141 g h@xmath96o / g dry protein . under these conditions",
    "the protein is immobile and inhibits the ice crystallization because it forces the water molecules out of the positions corresponding to a crystal configurations .",
    "the authors studied the hb dynamics , regardless if the hbs are formed within the water molecules or with the surface .",
    "they first locate the widom line , by monte carlo simulations , and observed that it corresponds to the locus where there is the largest change in the number of hbs . at @xmath2 and @xmath0 above the widom line , water has a few hbs , while at @xmath2 and @xmath0 below the widom line , it has a well - developed network of hbs .",
    "this change of structure is reflected by a maxima in constant-@xmath2 the specific heat along the widom line .",
    "the simulations also reveal the presence of a dynamic crossover in the hb correlation function @xmath97 when the widom line is crossed at constant @xmath2 . using mean field theory and making the hypothesis that the dynamics is dominated by the rearrangements of the hbs , the authors calculate the activation energy for the relaxation of the system and show that it gives the same relaxation time calculated by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the proposed mechanism consists in breaking a hb that does not fit into the tetrahedral arrangement and reorient the molecule to optimize locally the tetrahedral configuration .",
    "this mechanism has been confirmed also by simulations of the hydration shells of elastin - like and collagen - like peptides @xcite . in particular ,",
    "kumar et al .",
    "@xcite predict ( i ) how this barrier is affected by the variation of @xmath2 , ( ii ) how the crossover @xmath0 is affected by the variation of @xmath2 , and ( iii ) that for any @xmath2 the correlation time at the crossover @xmath0 is the same ( isochronic crossover ) .",
    "experiments with hydrated lysozyme , spanning a range of pressures going from ambient pressure up to 1600 bar , performed by the group of s .- h .",
    "chen at mit , have confirmed these three predictions @xcite .",
    "more recent analysis of lysozyme proteins at a lower hydration level ( @xmath1420.3 g h@xmath96o / g dry protein ) reveals another surprising results @xcite . at this very low hydration , dielectric spectroscopy ,",
    "probing the proton relaxation , displays that at ambient @xmath2 not only there is at about 250  k the dynamic crossover described above , but also another crossover at about 180  k. the study of the tractable model presented here associates this lower-@xmath0 crossover to the saturation of the cooperative ordering of the hb network .",
    "specifically , the hbs rearrange to maximize the number of tetrahedral orientations among the bonds .",
    "this ordering is marked by a new specific heat maxima that can be calculated in the model at about 180  k. therefore , summarizing , the model predicts a broad specific heat maximum at about 250  k , due to the saturation of a macroscopic hb network , and a sharper specific heat maximum at about 180  k , due to the saturation of the tetrahedral ordering of the hbs . by increasing the pressure of the hydrated protein , mazza et al .",
    "predict that these two maxima merge and then diverge at the liquid - liquid critical point @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a liquid - liquid critical point @xmath120 at low @xmath0 in confined water could be an undesirable property for the storage of frozen food and , more in general , biological cells .",
    "this is because in the vicinity of a critical point between two liquid phases , both metastable with respect to the crystal phase , large density fluctuations occur .",
    "these enhanced fluctuations would drastically changes the pathway for the formation of a crystal nucleus , because the crystal would form from the dense fluid , instead that from the low density fluid . as a consequence",
    ", there would be a strong reduction of the crystal nucleation free - energy barrier and , hence , an increase by many orders of magnitude of the crystallization rate , as theoretically predicted by ten wolde and frenkel @xcite .    under this conditions",
    "the enhanced formation of ice could destroy the cells as a consequence of the increase of volume of ice with respect to the liquid water @xcite .",
    "hence , the best way to preserve the cells would be to freeze them at a @xmath0 that is far away from the liquid - liquid critical temperature . nevertheless , further analysis show that the situation is even more complex .",
    "indeed , simulations of a model with a metastable liquid - liquid critical point display enhanced crystallization rate not only in the vicinity of the critical point , but in the vicinity of the whole region of liquid - liquid coexistence @xcite and possibly also in the one - phase region above the critical point along the widom line @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to elucidate these implications .    in the evaluation of these effects",
    "is extremely important to properly include the interaction with the confining surfaces .",
    "we are presently studying how to incorporate these effects in our tractable model .",
    "a first step in this direction is to include a description of the hydrophobic effect .",
    "frank and evans @xcite and silverstein et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that supercooled water forms highly structured `` ice - like '' regions in the hydration shell of nonpolar solutes .",
    "stillinger @xcite proposed that hbs in the hydration shell are not significantly perturbed near small hydrophobic solutes , while the hb network is strongly affected by hydrophobic particles with size above a characteristic value .",
    "chandler estimated this value of the order of 1  nm on the basis of free energy calculations @xcite .",
    "muller explained the vibrational and nmr spectroscopy results by suggesting enthalpic strengthening of the hydration hbs with a simultaneous entropy increase in the hydration shell @xcite .",
    "we are presently including the enthalpic strengthening in our model , and properly accounting for the entropy increase for the study of water in confined by hydrophobic nanoparticles .",
    "our preliminary results @xcite show a surprising change of thermodynamic fluctuations at low @xmath0 , whose implication is a large decrease of compressibility also at very low nanoparticles concentration .",
    "this finding suggests that adding hydrophobic particles at low concentration in organic solutions would decrease the density fluctuations and the formation of ice .",
    "further confirmation of the validity of our assumption about the hydrophobic effect comes from another study that we are performing to establish if our tractable model is able to describe the stability of proteins with respect to changes of temperature and pressure . in this study",
    "we consider how the hydrophobic interaction with water of a coarse - grained protein induces hot denaturation , folding , cold denaturation and pressure denaturation .",
    "our preliminary results @xcite display a region of stable folded configurations that , in the @xmath2@xmath0 phase diagram , has the same qualitative features of the experimental stability diagram of myoglobin @xcite ( fig.[protein ] ) .",
    "we have introduced a tractable model for a water monolayer hydrating surfaces of proteins and , more generally , confined water .",
    "the model includes hb cooperativity and elucidates how the many - body component of the hb is important to understand the low-@xmath0 behavior of water .",
    "in particular , parameters estimated from the experiments suggest the occurrence of a critical point at @xmath143  k and @xmath144  gpa at the end of a first order coexistence line between two liquids with different densities @xcite .",
    "the model shows that the liquid - liquid critical point affects the low-@xmath0 dehydration of a hydrophobic surface @xcite .",
    "the cooperativity of water induces dynamic heterogeneities that reach their maximum when the cluster of correlated hbs percolate @xcite .",
    "this heterogeneous dynamic behavior is revealed by a strongly non - exponential relaxation of the hb dynamics and by a subdiffusive translational motion of the water molecules in the hydration shell @xcite , as observed in hydrated proteins at low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the model predicts that , at low protein hydration , shell water should be characterized by two structural transitions .",
    "one associated to the macroscopic formation of hbs @xcite , occurring at about 250  k for low - hydrated lysozyme , and another associated to the tetrahedral reordering of the hbs , at about 180  k @xcite .",
    "these two structural changes are at the origin of two dynamic crossovers : the one at higher @xmath0 has been observed by qens experiments on hydrated lysozyme @xcite , and both have been measured by dielectric spectroscopy on hydrated lysozyme @xcite . the pressure behavior of these crossover is consistent with the presence of the liquid - liquid critical point @xmath120 at high @xmath2 and low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the large increase of density fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath120 is expected to enhance the water crystallization process . as a consequence of the expansion of ice",
    ", this process could destroy biological structures in a crowed environment , as for example in food stored at low temperature @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , relevant to understand if this process is affected by confinement or if it could be controlled .",
    "our preliminary results @xcite show that hydrophobic confinement has a strong effect of the thermodynamics of water , suppressing the density fluctuations associated to the critical point @xmath120 .",
    "this result suggests that by dissolving hydrophobic nanoparticles at low concentration it could be possible to control the water compressibility and the formation of large crystals .",
    "these predictions are based on a modelization of the hydrophobic interaction that is able to reproduce a stability diagram for a coarse - grained protein . in particular",
    ", the model shows that the protein cold denaturation and the pressure denaturation can be explained as a consequence of the strengthening of interfacial water - water hbs at the hydrophobic interface and the proper account of the entropy change due to the presence of the interface @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to include other features in the model and to use it to make other predictions in different contexts .",
    "for example , we are extending the model in such a way to describe the ice formation and analyze how the crystallization process is affected by interfaces .",
    "we are also developing the generalization in three dimensions to allow the study of many layers of hydration water and to extend the investigation to the bulk case . in this way our research about protein stability will be developed also in bulk water .",
    "all together these generalizations will allow us to explore situations of possible interest in food science and biology , as for example the effect on water structure and dynamics of preservative agents such as trehalose , or antifreeze proteins , or cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide .",
